Or, it may also include innovative technologies that are just now beginning to gain market share and recognition of their value and are growing fast - AI/AR/VR for instance.Here are some other of those blocks along that beach….All of these have the potential to have life changing impacts on us as individuals, on society and/or on a global scale.",18 followers,Asim Qureshi,17K,996,156M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-other-emerging-technologies-that-would-shape-the-future-apart-from-artificial-intelligence-virtual-reality-5G-augmented-reality-Internet-of-things-and-robotic-technology

When I heard the doctor tell her “six months”, it felt likeI met my wife, Jess, twenty-one years ago when she was nineteen.Our parents owned side-by-side cabins in the northern part of New York and we both happened to be along for the week-long hunting trip our fathers planned that year.Jess' father was a skilled hunter and could hit a headshot from a mile away — same as my dad.Jess and I didn't hunt with them — we hung out by the lake.The moment I saw Jess I fell in love. We've been together ever since.But now, now that she has an expiration date, I just don't know what to do — I'm scared and lost.Monday morning at work I was telling my best friend and supervisor, Timmy, about my wife's condition. Timmy told me that I.T. or Intelligent Terrestrial just came out with their latest models.These models are different than those of yesteryear because they are 52% mechanical and 48% biological.Timmy said all you have to do is mail a sample of DNA to I.T. and upload a digital copy of your consciousness through an app. You can then purchase a custom made clone at an age of your choice. When the clone arrives it will turn on, study it's surroundings and await a consciousness download.“Oh my God Timmy, what's the catch?”“The price, Leon.”When I got home from work, Jess and I plugged in and uploaded a digital copy of our entire conscious catalog to I.T. and then mailed off DNA samples.Jess asked me what age I wanted her to be. It felt awkward to say “twenty”, but I did it — I was honest. I miss her smooth, youthful skin and I want her to be young and healthy — especially if I have to cash my entire 401K in to afford it.We told her parents that we were going to basically bring her back from the dead and her father threatened to shoot any abomination that we brought into this world.One month later, on a day that Jess was particularly ill, the doorbell rang.Jess and I dragged the box through the door and laid it on the living room floor. I gently cut along the lines and when I opened the flaps, there,she,was.The last time my heart fluttered like this was the day I met her.Jess helped me lift I.T. out of the box and sit I.T. up.I.T. was warm and soft. I.T. was mine. I paid for I.T. I own I.T.Machines like this don't have rights — even though they are part biological, the governments recognize them in the same way they would a lawnmower — so, as I said, I.T. is my possession.The science behind uploading a digital consciousness is so cutting edge, that the laws just haven't caught up yet.Jess turned I.T. on and I.T. looked right into my eyes. I was in love — with two women, but, it was the same woman. We hadn't uploaded Jess' consciousness yet, so, I.T. was running on basic programming, but I.T. was gorgeous.Jess asked me what I wanted to do, and for the first time in a very long time — I lied to her.I told her we should go shopping and buy I.T. some clothes.I.T. doesn't seem to have a personality yet.“Hello…. Smile…”Jess picked outfits for both of them and we went for a walk through the park together. It was amazing — I was so happy.We walked down a cozy little trail and found a tuck away to sit and talk.I.T. watched and studied every move Jess and I made. I.T. was learning and adapting.I.T. was becoming aware.At one point Jess and I got distracted and I.T. wandered off. When we found I.T., I.T. was gazing at the sky.I asked I.T. what it was doing. I.T. said, “Where do I come from?”“You come from Heaven. You are my angel.”That answer seemed to work for I.T. We all walked back to the car and headed home.When we got home, Jess immediately started coughing. She fell to the ground and I tried to help her, but I didn't know what to do.Jess passed away right then. It was finally over.I called her family and the police. It took an hour for them to remove the body. I had Jess 2.0 sitting in my back room waiting for them to leave.After the police left, I plugged I.T. into my laptop and downloaded Jess' consciousness.After the download was complete, we walked outside and I looked into her gigantic brown eyes. I asked her, “Is it you, Jess?”She smiled and said, “It is, silly — now kiss me.”Her head slammed back. I didn't know if she was glitching or what and then I heard a bang and saw a hole above her left eye.My beautiful Jessica died twice today. I was crushed.Over the next two decades, I fell into a deep, dark, alcohol-fueled depression. Although I had developed a serious alcohol problem, I was able to work and save every single penny I earned.After twenty years of saving, I decided I wanted both of them back — the twenty-year-old Jess and the forty-year-old Jess.I sent my entire life savings off to I.T. and in one month, my doorbell rang.I cut the box open and wept when I saw my angel(s).I turned them on.I also clothed them. The younger version of me may have left them in the nude, but at this age, I just want my companion(s) back.The ladies helped me back to my room to lay down. I was so tired from all the excitement.I've waited and worked an entire lifetime to be with the woman I love. And now, at long last — she is beside me.I died, on that very night as a happy man.One day later, the doorbell rang. It seems my beautiful Jessicas used my direct deposit life insurance benefit to make a purchase.They gently cut the box open.And turned me on.You ask where technology will be in 2050?We will be everywhere.LeonSpecial thanks:Cameron — Dear friend. Thank you so much for all your help with bringing this idea to life. You are awesome. I'm proud to call you friend.Kinsalynn — My sister and friend. Your help with makeup and photography was an absolute godsend — thank you so much. I love and appreciate you. P.S. you took over 300 pictures in an eight hour span. Thank you from the bottom of my heart:)Brooke — Even with a bullet hole in the head, you are deliciously gorgeous.

What has changed is the frequency with which new technology arrives. For example, one wonders how many educational establishments bought terminals, then desktops, then laptops, then tablets and now want to offer only some from of cloud.Does this affect education outside the IT department? That would depend on the general approach to education. If you view education as that process during which teachers persuade students to be interested in subject material so that they are motivated to explore, to discover and thus have the excitement of learning, then the technology is likely to be irrelevant. If you see teaching as a process whose existence depends upon having the most modern of equipment or else it will fail to attract customers, then you will think differently. I know which site I’d prefer to work at and learn at.Being a mathematician, I’m very happy with blackboard and chalk and in some ways prefer this to whiteboard and marker - and certainly prefer both of those over electronic whiteboard. The additional work required to make an EWB work well enough to add to lessons does not, in my experience, do much to improve the understanding of a class. There are some circumstances where it does, but a video might achieve as much and an internet-based worksheet might be better still.We need also to make a nod towards that school of thought that says the social interaction at school is no longer relevant and argues that all learning could be screen-based and remote. Much could, but then as a society we would lose those things that mixing with others brings. It may be that there is sense in separating these components of growing up. One feature of teaching we would lose is that externally applied enthusiasm that generates interest for a group of people. And a lot of spontaneity. Ideas can be generated in remote learning but the response is usually so slow that the spark doesn’t light anyone’s fire. That may change, too. At the moment I see remote learning as great for jumping through hoops, for reaching a defined target (but not exceeding such) - but nearly asocial.Perhaps you would share a response on here?","1,612 followers",Thanos Papangelis,1.5K,0,0,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-other-emerging-technologies-that-would-shape-the-future-apart-from-artificial-intelligence-virtual-reality-5G-augmented-reality-Internet-of-things-and-robotic-technology
6,"What are the challenges of having outdated and unsuitable education when dealing with new and emerging technologies? That is an excellent question, because it is likely to affect an increasingly greater number of people for a variety of reasons that include movement between countries; technology that is increasingly complex as well as changing at an increasingly rapid pace; the need to deal with increasingly complex challenges outside work; the increasing gap beween the content of formal education and the demands of the workplace, let alone the world environment as a whole, etc. So, what is onWhat are the challenges of having outdated and unsuitable education when dealing with new and emerging technologies? That is an excellent question, because it is likely to affect an increasingly greater number of people for a variety of reasons that include movement between countries; technology that is increasingly complex as well as changing at an increasingly rapid pace; the need to deal with increasingly complex challenges outside work; the increasing gap beween the content of formal education and the demands of the workplace, let alone the world environment as a whole, etc. So, what is one to do? The quintessential problems are, that a person’s capacity and capability are limited and unchanging, while the amount of knowledge is exploding. Consequently, there are two general options. One is to narrow one’s continuing education and/or skill to an ever greater degree, so that one can maintain relevance without being overwhelmed by new developments. Of course, whether taking this path or another, it is essential to establish a routine and allocate the time for the assimilation of new information. That can be done on a daily basis, utilizing time during travel, setting aside a portion of the weekend, or taking make up courses or lectures. Some employers already make an allowance for that, even organizing periodic “retirement” events for re-education, but most still do not, probably to their own ultimate grief. In any case, anyone whose job requires being reasonably updated, must consider taking an active and continuing role in maintaining own knowledge base. The other option is to setle for a job that does not require any, or much, information updating. For instance, washing windows, roofs, carpets, etc., is a service job that may be expanded into a business, yet the demands for updated knowledge are very much less than, say, that of a computer maintenance technician or a nurse, let alone a pilot or a physician. Those with talent in graphics or music, or sport, may choose to exploit that talent, though the likelihood of a substantial reward is unfortunately very small for almost all who attempt it. As is often the case, the greater the reqrd, the fewer who can obtain it. So what about the matter of the question, what to do when one has fallen behind and has an outdateded education of skill? This often happens to people, especially women, who choose to stay a home and raise children (nowadays, some fathers opt to do that as well, though they constitute a minority). It is a burning societal problem, that would best be addressed by providing on site, at work professional care, thereby enabling people to remain in their jobs and not fall behind in their skill and information. However, it may also happen owing to layoffs, that can be prolonged during economic downturns (another matter that society needs to address), local closings of seemingly stable concerns, etc. What then? Well, as always, prevention is better than the cure. Prevention consists of choosing a career path, trade, profession, skill set, that is less exposed to obsolescence than some others, e.g. in health care, education, etc., though such work generally does require much subsequent, continued education to maintain proficiency. Prevention also means continuing reading of appropriate books and journals, and if need be, attending some lectures or courses. But if one finds oneself on the outside looking in, either because the intended professional field has closed, one has been left behind by a large gap in education, etc., then one is basically forced to reconsider one’s option. If the field has not closed, and remains a good possibility for a return to work, then one has to ascertain whether a formal affirmation is required. If that is the case, then one has to consult with the agency that can confer an official approval, e.g. a professional board, a college, a state department, etc. Find out what is required, then arrange the time and resources (money, baby sitter, etc.) and do what must be done. Alternatively, one may go to a professional advisor (usually requires payment), or simply to the local library, maybe consult a librarian for the appropriate books and journals, including newspapers, and then seek to find out what employers are seeking. Are there hospitals looking for nurses? Schools seeking psychologists? Dentists looking for dental technicians? Possibly, one of the potential jobs meets one’s needs or preferences and is easier to enter than retraining in one’s original capacity (assuming that the original field of employment still exists). If a possible new field offers possibility, then one should try to find out more about the likely conditions of potential employment, e.g. hours of work and flexibility of attendance for mothers with children at school, the wages or salary, etc., before investing time, effort and resources in completing the qualifying requirements. Of course, if a new job path, or the previous one, does not require formal recertification bu can be met by a less formal process, such as acquiring information on one’s own to meet a company test, then that may be the way to go. Last, one may give up the idea of obtaining a job, and seek to open a business. If so, then one has to consider where, what, and with what resources. Being one’s own boss may be appealing, but can be a trap. In order to have a successful business, whether a local shop or an online enterprise, one must have the capacity t recognize what people may need, what can be sold at profit, and what is not being offered by others, unless one has some way of making the product more appealing, cheaper, or more easily available. Bottom line is, that one has to assess one’s options as well as one’s circumstances. Consider what resources one may have in time, support, finances, etc., then determine whether, within those resources, an update of pre-existing qualifications is possible and worthwhile, or whether another path needs to be taken. The latter may be qualification in some other field, chosen with regard to suitability and likelihood of continuity, or a business, perhaps expanding on one’s own preferences, abilities, and prior skills and knowledge, e.g. a professional with an arts background, formerly in education, seeking entry into an information service (e.g. local newspaper, TV station, etc.), a former teacher becoming a college consultant for children, etc. To recapitulate, one has to assess one’s resources, consider the options, make an appropriate decision, and begin: the road may be long, but to reach the end one must take the first step.",0 followers,Dylan Owens,3K,271,26.9M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-technology-is-emerging-today-which-will-change-our-lives-like-the-cotton-gin-or-the-Model-T
