Part of these compatriots after the outbreak of war entered the Serbian army and volunteer troops. Many Czechs also lived in Belgrade, where they gathered together under the patriotic associations Lumír and Havlíček. When the war broke out and Belgrade itself was evacuated before the advancing Austro-Hungarian army, many Czech compatriots escaped further into the Serbian inland.The dislike of most Czechs to fight against Serbs was substantially manifested in the Austro-Hungarian army offensive in Serbia. Soldiers recruited to the Austro-Hungarian army in Czechia in the autumn of 1914 during heavy fighting with a fierce and bravely defending Serbian army, in large numbers got into Serbian captivity. They founded one of several parts of Czechoslovak legions (as well as in Russia, Romania, Italy and France) units in Serbia and part of them fought in the rows of Serbian army (above all in Russia).Of course, the interwar allied agreement Czechoslovakia /Yugoslavia / Romania (called sometimes “Little Entente”) cannot be forgotten. I hope, we will not forget the Serbian offer of help when Hitler started his campaign for the annexation of our territory. Unfortunately, the Munich dictate made it impossible.A lot of Czechs never agreed with the separation of Kosovo.

It is thought that the Antikythera mechanism was been transported from Crete to the Greek mainland.My own view is the mechanism is the culmination of the study of astronomy over Millenium and an improving understanding of the mechanical arts. It is a truly stunning complex machine for the time, see the video.There is an early far simpler device found on MInoan Crete called theThis is an example, there are 49 devices on the horizontal border, if we consider these to be months, this is a four year Olympiad, when the Minoans added a 13th intercalated ‘leap’ month each fourth year to keep the Solar and lunar calendar aligned and it appears celebrated by jumping the bull. It took me a while to work out what the 14 verticle devices may be and this may be referring to solar years, so collectively an eighteen yearThe moulds have been analysed and it is thought this device is 94% accurate in predicting eclipses.There is no evidence that the Minoans had a gear, but one can see how the idea of a cog may have come into being from these intermeshing devices. The one on the right is for lunar period (first use of a week - moon phase) and I believe this flipflops before advancing a position on the solar device on the left. This allows a 29.5 day synodic lunar months to be maintained (alternating between 29 and 30 day month) and a full rotation represents a four-year Olympiad.It hugely frustrating that the Antikythera mechanism shows a hugely complex gear train and there are no tangible examples of gears before it, I think it very unlikely this was the first attempt, it more likely that this developed over many iterations from simpler mechanisms. The astronomical periods to encode the mechanism also seem to be known way before the mechanism, it didn't come completely out of the blue.It appears that the Minoans were not the first to use a 13th leap-month, this Vinca calendar shows an intercalated 13th Month, I’m not sure of the exact dating some time around 4,500 BCE. Also look carefully at what is shown on the ladies head above (Linear A symbol 122) which I believe represents Mother Earth (a day), the device on the right daughter moon (a Month) , a solar year at each of the cardinal points and his consort venus 2 full rotations (an eight yearTo encode the orbital period into the Antikythera mechanism the astronomical periods and rules first need to be established and this seems to have been known in prehistory at a basic level (a leap month every fourth year). The symbol shown above is RE, a possible root is Rhea, or mountain mother. The Minoan refer to I-DA-MA-TE (Demeter) giving an Earth day, they have another deity called the Master of Animals (Apollo) which represents the Sun and a solar year. This very old belief system in prehistory is likely derived from Mother Earth and Sky Father (they meet on the mountain top).I’m not sure advanced is the correct term, as we have much more advanced systems today, however, I’m hugely impressed by these very earlier and more simple calendars. I particularly like this one called Bird-man from Nevalı Çori (a short distance from Gobeliki Tepe), as you can see it shows the count of days in the year in the background which is confirmed on the ribs of the entwined snake. There is a possibility this is also referring to an Olympiad (four-year solar cycles) and anThe cultures that were successful with agriculture seem to have a calendar to plan! That is the purpose of the mechanism when to plant seed and harvest to maximise crop yield when to train athletes to compete in the games. The mechanism simulates natural cycles observed in astronomy and these do affect growing seasons, at least these early cultures want to better understand nature and in particular the growing seasons.As to who made the Antikythera mechanism, a craftsman on Crete I think it likely, they preserve the old tradition and knowledge of astronomy. This is a Minoan so-called throne room at Knossos. Fig 29:You can see where the embodiment of Mother Earth sat, her offspring (Sun and daughter moon shown), the 12 months of the year , with Equinox with )( sign. AnThis is where they likely conducted astronomical observation, peak sanctuaries. They seem to be studying astronomy for centuries if not longer.Note the horizontal and verticle markers, which imply they are measuring the positions of celestial bodies and stars over time. These are some lenses found in a mountain top cave that could have assisted, they are precision ground from rock-crystal (natural glass).To encode the mechanism one need to determine these astronomical periods. I-DA-MA-TE (Earth Mother) is responsible for ensuring there is sufficient grain for the barren winter months, to continue the generations of LIFE. It's a very old idea and those that studied astronomy understood the underlying patterns to be able to increase crop yields! The mechanism is the result of this study which according to the archaeology seems to begin over 9 millennia before around the area where wild wheat was cultivated to make beer and the tribes meet to exchange things and ideas!They could all meet at known times of the year because they had a calendar! Just as we do today when we meet every four years to celebrate the Olympic games. It has the same purpose to meet and build a better world for the generations to come. Those that play together stay together!Note the pole stars on the Griffons wing which change with the ages they were thinking over very long time periods. So if anyone finds these Aegean numerals on a tablet, it is likely a reference to the Great Year!I do not perceive the mechanism as a sudden breakthrough, rather the logical progression of an improving model of the observable solar system, specifically nature that become in the fullness of time physics. The upheld hands mean to continue the generations of life. I suspect when they know how long the Great Year is, they have discovered the last piece of the jigsaw puzzle, their equivalent of splitting the atom.The successful cultures that used protowriting (which was way before cuneiform) and prospered are all studying astronomy and some of the first symbols actually seem to relate to astronomy, they are wanting to determine the underlying cycles of life, they used calendars to plan, also consider for agriculture to produce greater output, you need labour and this means keeping a record of work done to allocate grain for this period of work. The mechanism is useful, it informs what to observe to confirm a datum event and when an eclipse will occur. Imagine what people would think when someone could predict when the sun would go out. But mostly its used as a calendar, in X moons lets meet at such and such arena. Those that had access to such a device could plan to ensure athletes were trained, and it gave Kudos to the city-state that won them. Also by keeping an accurate calendar would potentially allow optimising yields for agricultural output. SeeAs to why it took a thousand years before a similarly sophisticated machine appears, I think this is likely what followed, the Roman empire held many lands and didn’t develop machines (which were expensive compared to using slaves) so the mechanical arts flagged over this period. There is not a lot of technical development over the first millennium compared to say any of the first three Millenium before the common era. This is not to say there is no development, Romans built some rather impressive buildings and systems of law, but didn’t develop many technologies or machines (as they had slaves to do this work), they more rolled out proven technology.",18 followers,Asim Qureshi,17K,996,156M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-do-we-need-more-of-in-the-future-advance-technology-or-more-humanitarian-efforts

There is no documentation.However, because we can examine the mechanism in detail and see how it was made and what it does, we can make, I suggest, reasonable guesses.But before I make my reasonable guess, can I just deny that this is an advanced technology. There is nothing here but gears and clockwork. All of that was well-known many years before the Greeks and Romans were using it. The exact ratio of the gear trains and the interconnections necessary no doubt needed years of trial and error to get right. But advanced technology in our modern terms? No.So with that in mind we can look at the gear train of the mechanism and see that it reproduces the movements of the observable stars and planets with some degree of accuracy. It looks as if it would predict, for instance, the eclipses of the sun and moon according to the so-calledSo, in a way, we can see that it is something like anNow if we consider what kind of a person might use a device that could predict the relative positions of stars and planets we would, I suggest, inevitably come down to thinking of astrologers and the casting of horoscopes.Astrology starts from the gnomic saying ‘as above, so below’. This is the evidence-free assertion that all our life-cycle events, all our life-changing decisions, are mapped out by the relative positions of the planets.There is the tiniest of touches to give some small credence to this notion: since the cosmos acts as a giant, seasonal clock, the stars can tell the farmers when to plant the seeds for next year’s crops. That’s it. Big clock.But such a house of cards has been erected on this fact of seasonal changes that much of human civilization has been influenced by astrology. And even now astrology has influence in the less technical parts of the world.If you have a system that introduces enough random chance into diagnostics of the state of the world and of the client, the astrologer can persuade the stars to say any damn thing that the astrologer considers a reasonable bet.There will, of course, always be those, like myself, of a cynical cast of mind who look with great skepticism on the forecasts of astrologers. There were even such at the time the Anticythera mechanism was in play.Take the Emperor Tiberius, for example. A confirmed skeptic, the emperor took to asking astrologers to take a walk with him along the cliffs by the sea. Asked to forecast their own future the astrologers hopefully predicted good fortune and a prosperous long life. When he heard this the emperor would prove the prophet false by kicking him off the cliff.But at length he met his match when the astrologer read the runes and cast his horoscope and reeled back aghast. “Oh my Emperor”, he cried. “ I am in terrible danger!
