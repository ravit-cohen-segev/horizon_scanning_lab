It predicts the exact same outcomes of experiments as every other interpretation, and mathematically it is very cumbersome to actually solve for the hidden variables.The great advantage offered by Bohmian mechanics is that it supplies quantum mechanics with a clear ontology. It translates quantum processes into nice, visualize-able scenes. The picture is this:As an illustration, we can look at the quantum double slit experiment. The Bohmian interpretation argues that as the particle approaches the slits, it creates ripples in the pilot wave which propagate ahead through both slits. The pilot wave oscillations emerging from both slits superimpose and interfere. The particle then passes through one slit or the other (not both) and rides the pilot wave pattern to the screen.Example trajectories are plotted in the image, where you can see the pilot wave focusing the trajectories towards the observed maxima.So, this is the picture. Why isn't it more popular among physicists? Well, like I said at the start, it is hard to solve for the trajectories and the evolving pilot wave. You can kinda tell from the picture above that those trajectories aren't nice closed form functions. It's much easier just to solve for the wave function, or to calculate a Feynman path integral. Besides, knowing the trajectories doesn't tell us any observable information that these simpler approaches lack. Experimentally, nothing new is gained from knowing the trajectory of the particleAnother bigger issue is the problem of non-locality. The Bell experiments on entangled systems demonstrate that the pilot wave must be non-local (i.e. disturbances in the pilot wave propagate faster than light).Non-locality is a serious issue to many physicists, as physical reality appears to be constrained by a maximum speed limit. Anything that violates this speed limit, such as virtual particles, shadows, etc, is taken to be devoid of physical substance. If the pilot wave is non-local, then it seems like it is just a mathematical artifact of the theory -- much like virtual particles -- rather than a physical system in and of itself.For me personally, I reject Bohmian mechanics because think it is philosophically unsatisfying to bring classical baggage into the quantum world. Quantum mechanics is the fundamental theory -- it is the correct theory that matches all the predictions.  Classical physics is the derived theory that is wrong on many predictions. We should be understanding classical physics on quantum terms rather than vice-versa.",UNKNOWN,Shaun,13.8K,1.2K,884.3K,2016,https://www.quora.com/Why-doesnt-Bohmian-Mechanics-receive-more-attention

CHECKING THE SUMP PUMP BATTERY A FEW WEEKS BACK LEFT ME WITH A BURN ON MY ARM, SINCE GONE AWAY. THE SECOND PHOTO IS AN UPDATE FROM AUGUST 10th 2019, JUST SO YOU ALL CAN SEE I’M STILL THE WORLD’S PUNCHING BAG.But let’s start from the beginning.09SEP1959 Born with my umbilical cord wrapped around my neck. Blood drained from my brain, end result cerebral palsy. Scar#1, more like a dent above my right eye.Never mind the accidents that just about everyone has when they are growing up. The big event was 18MAR1989, when I was hit by a car and then slammed into a parked bus. Both bones in my left arm poking out of the skin of my forearm and I had contusions in my brain. So my arm stayed separated for 16 days, and they operated when my contusions were gone.I had metal plates in my arm and they broke. I have CP on my right side, so my left arm HAD to be fixed. All together there were seven operations and I had my arm in various casts for 291 days.What my arm looked like after the plates broke.I always forget about what my knee looked like after I was hit by the car.If you ever have your arm in a contraption like this, filled with ice, you’ll want to scream. Fire and ice. The final option was to leave part of my ulna missing and put a chunk of my right hip bone into my left arm. I was given Demoral every 90 minutes. When it wore off it was like having my arm submerged in cold water with someone using a hot poker to peel off layers of my skin.Oh. In 1983, I cut open my knee riding an exercise bike.. Twelve stitches. I’m prone to spasms and I often hit my head against the (unfortunately) brick wall as I let the dog out in winter or leave the house.In 2005, I spasmed in the shower and tore off a layer of skin (true, the area never tans) when my head hit the metal soap dish. Luckily, the glass door swung open, but I fell down and hit my head on the toilet bowl. And yet, here I am.This is the end result of a spasm. In this photo, you can sort of see the blue lines converge. That is where my skull was drilled into after I was born.Caught my foot under one of those subway stalls last winter. I was visiting a friend who had cancer, and never really felt the pain until I left the hospital, and I was unable to get my gym shoe off. All is well again.Long story to this one. Funny how when I’m injured I always have stubble like I’m a bum. The best scar is the one I got in my crawlspace. I had a spasm and slammed my head into an I-beam and knocked myself out. Here is the dent.Hard taking photos from straight above your head, but there’s my new dent.“Baptized in danger of death.” Silly Polish Roman Catholic priests. There’s a burn on my arm from scalding water, cuts behind my right ear, a small cut near my eye after I was punched getting mugged. Etc. Etc.If you see somebody on the street that looks like this, odds are it is me.UPDATE: new scar as of yesterday, 09JUN16.Had a spasm at the wrong time while in the gym locker room, my locker was open and bammo, I knocked the door off it’s hinges.","4,673 followers",Wayne Allen Sallee,2.9K,3.4K,27.3M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Why-doesnt-Bohmian-Mechanics-receive-more-attention

Hey, I’m human.There was a guy looking at a guitar shop. He was staring at it for a while and he seemed a bit sad. I have seen this guy a few times.I one day walked into shop and he was standing out side again, staring at this one guitar. I walked outside and I asked..“Hey man, good guitar isn’t it?”I heard two voices in my head.One voice saying, “don’t you do it. You saved for a guitar for ages. You got to do those gigs. Don’t do it.”And another voice, saying, “You will be ok. You’re a super hero.”I walked into shop, bought the guitar and saw the sadness as the guy went to get the guitar from the window.I walked out and gave him the guitar with..“Now you can sing to your dad and everyone else. have a nice day” and walked away.One voice saying “are you nuts! Crazy! Stop doing this shit.”And other voice said, “feels good, doesn’t it?”The other time, is when I was at a record studio and a group of guys and girls were there, asking how much to book studio.The guy said “£560 for a full day.”Their heart sank. They looked to each other and then asked a guy..“Is there a studio where we can do a demo for £100? That’s all we got?”But no. The city is filled with recording studios and long gone are the studios that use to help communities to do that due to cutting taxes etc. Lots of organisations gone for these young guys and girls.As they walked out, and girls saying “I knew it be more. Shit!”The other guys feeling down as their coolness hit rock bottom, I talked to the engineer, and he went down the steps and…“Hey, wait a minute.”They stopped…“We just had a cancellation and we’ll lose money, so you can get 6 hours for £100 and…you’ll get very good engineer.”I saw smiles on their faces when they walked back up and into the reception. They couldn’t believe it. I can feel their excitement. The girls jumping a bit and smiling, and the guys we’re like - ‘Yeah man, we’re cool. We got this!’I don’t know. I just felt like they were my bros and sisters. Sure, different race, colour, white british but I saw them like my family, which is what the human race is.

She has a unique mutation called a “tetrachromat,” in which mutations on both her X chromosomes led to extra cones in her eyes, giving her enhanced vision, and even cooler, enhanced color detection.She reportedly can see and distinguish about nine million different colors, most of which are “invisible colors,” meaning that almost no other humans can perceive them. She reportedly views everyday objects such as rocks and pebbles as vibrant displays of rainbow-like colors popping out at her, and can see pinks, oranges, yellows, reds, and blues across the surface of a road.Enhanced Stomach LiningThis one’s definitely one of the weirder superpowers. A French comedian named Michel Lotito regularly shocked audiences by consuming all sorts of objects and having no adverse reactions afterward.He has eaten all of the following: 18 bicycles, 15 supermarket trolleys, seven TV sets, six chandeliers, two beds, a pair of skis, a computer, and even a plane.After further research, doctors concluded that the secret to his ability lay in his stomach lining, which was so thick that he was able to digest metal—nine tons of it, in fact, before he died of natural causes.Enhanced MemoryReported to be more of a curse than a superpower.The most well-known example is that of Marilu Henner, who can remember nearly all the events in her life, down to the minutest details.She has a neurological condition called hyperthymesia (AKA highly superior autobiographical memory (HSAM)), which allows her to store memories like pictures on a camera roll—when she visits these memories, she claims it is like rewatching old videos or looking at old pictures. She can even pinpoint which memories occur at what point in her life and recall specific memories from that time.Enhanced Intelligence and Rapid CalculationScott Flansburg, AKA The Human Calculator, is capable of performing mental mathematical functions faster than a calculator.There have been many, many instances of insanely fast calculation performed by this man, but what makes him so unique is how his power came about.A rare, unnamed genetic mutation had combined the area of the brain that does math with the area of the brain that controls movement—the motor cortex. Thus, his brain was hardwired to do math as easily as walking and talking.Enhanced Sense of SmellJoy Milne from Scotland has an extremely unusual ability: she is capable of smelling Parkinson’s Disease and some forms of cancer before diagnosis. In a study conducted by Edinburgh University, she could smell the disease 12/12 times on average. Joy could even detect the disease just by smelling a patient’s clothes.This was a major breakthrough, since it led scientists to conclude that the disease gave off a molecular signature in the form of an odor—one that could be tracked.Before long, a collection of 10 molecules were found, all were unique to Parkinson’s patients. The cause for this ability is still unknown.Weather and Cold ResistanceWim Hof, a Dutch athlete known locally as the Iceman, is capable of surviving in extremely cold temperatures, due to his strange breathing patterns.Hof can consciously control his breathing to speed up his heart rate, raise his adrenaline levels, and increase his nervous system activity. He claims that he has achieved this level of self-control through meditation and the “Wim Hof Method,” which he says that anyone can use to gain a greater degree of self-knowledge.As a result, he’s capable of withstanding extreme cold, and has performed many mind bending feats, like staying in an ice-bath for almost two hours and climbing Mount Everest in his underwear.Superhuman EnduranceIt may sound over dramatized, but this one truly is superhuman.Dean Karnazes, an ultramarathon runner, was born with a quite peculiar trait: his body does not produce lactic acid.Lactic acid causes the burning sensation you feel when you exercise. When it builds up, your muscles undergo fatigue. Karnazes’s body, on the other hand, does not experience this buildup. Thus, he can run inconceivable distances, usually without breaking much of a sweat.Karnazes has achieved numerous mind-boggling feats using his gift, such as:These are but a few of his accomplishments. It has been speculated that, should he be supplied with adequate food and water, he could run indefinitely and only be stopped by injury to his feet.Superhuman Bone DensityA man back in 1994, only known as John, was involved in a car crash, and walked away completely unscathed. A subsequent X-ray revealed that his bones were about eight times denser than the average person’s, meaning that John (and his distant relatives, sprinkled across the Eastern Seaboard) was capable of surviving almost all forms of blunt-force trauma, and his bones would not fracture.A mutated region of chromosome 11 turned out to be the cause. John and his relatives all had a mutation called LRP5, which deals with the LDL receptors in the body, and a total of 21 other family members had the condition.Thank you for reading.Sources:The world's densest bonesMeet the woman who can smell Parkinson's diseaseWeird world records: bizarre entries in the Guinness Book of World RecordsThe women with superhuman visionScott Flansburg - Human Calculator - Super Human Number 8 - Real life SuperhumansSuperior Autobiographical Memory & Hyperthymesia RecallScience Explains How the Iceman Resists Extreme ColdDean Karnazes",0 followers,Nor Reza,5.5K,8.6K,50.6M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-closest-thing-you-have-to-a-superpower

Just last year, Indian stock market surpassed French stock market to become the 5th most valued stock market upon beating UK, Canada and Saudi Arabia.Latest Edit —IndiaIndia's Foreign Relations —We have also observed India's sudden change in reaction towards global matters.From my understanding of geopolitical changes, India has adopted an aggressive stance over a defensive one for now.In the past 3 years, India has made it's presence known all over the world. From doing humanitarian activities across the globe to influencing their neighbours who were once their enemies.The Colossal Connection (India-US bond) —India-US relations have also changed drastically where USA who now sees India as a major strategical partner and is supporting India's rise in Asia for the moment, once was anti-India.According to USA's Indo-Pacific strategy, it considersOver the past decade, the closeness between India and USA has grown a lot. They've signed multiple Military and Information sharing pacts with each other as well and I'm sure many more are coming in near future.According to America's own diplomats “USA needs India more than India needs USA ”.But USA has it's own motives. China will surpass USA in almost everything by the end of this decade which will eventually end the Western Hegemony.India is the only country which can counter China in the current scenario. A strong and powerful India is in USA's best interests for now and America will do everything possible to keep things that way.So the West will keep supporting India as long as they see a threat in China and Russia.India's Masterpiece of a Foreign Policy —India is among the few countries in the world which can play both Russia and USA at the same time.India is nearly immune to Western sanctions and also gets to trade with sanctioned countries like Russia and Iran and I can't think of any other country which can do the same.I can write a lot more but I believe these are enough points.","359,008 followers",Sean Kernan,733,5.6K,727.2M,2022,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-closest-thing-you-have-to-a-superpower
