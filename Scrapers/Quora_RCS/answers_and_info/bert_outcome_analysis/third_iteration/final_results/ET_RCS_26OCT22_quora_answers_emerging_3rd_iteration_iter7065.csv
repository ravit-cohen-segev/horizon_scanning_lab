As of 2019, the preferred architecture is SPA framework+Mobile app and backend REST services. With the rise of Microservices model, the immediate backend which the web application connects to, does not need the bells and whistles associated with Java(Spring Boot/Jersey, etc). So Designers and architects are using Non-blocking IO languages/frameworks which are lightweight like node.js+express. Complex reusable APIs that require orchestration, Database interaction will, however, be written in Java.So my prediction for the future is more existing Java(Spring MVC etc) will be replaced with Javascript SPAs front end and Node+express backend REST APIs. The “throw-away” Node-express APIs will talk to “reusable” Java(or .net or python) “middleware” APIs which will do all the heavy lifting computation.AndroidThanks to Oracle’s lawsuit against Google, there is a strategic shift in Android to move towards Kotlin. Also, there are wide verity of mobile development frameworks to choose from like Flutter(dart), React Native(Javascript), Native Script(Javascript). So there will be far fewer openings for Java developers in Android space.Big Data and AnalyticsPython and R are the default go-to language now for Big data and analytics. Python is very easy to pick up and has been historically used for data analytics by scientists and educators. R is specifically built for data analytics.Enterprise and middleware software",81 followers,Jason Martin,1.2K,306,1.5M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-future-of-Java-developers-Will-they-compete-with-trending-technologies

4,"Neither of them. These are not languages of the future, they are survivors from the past. Past performance is no indication of future performance. Look at C, despite the incredible amount of nonsensical negativity against it by woolly minded OOP sycophants, it has been used in production since 1972 ( that’s 46 years). Python is actually implemented in C, and the reason people adopt Python is not because Python is so good, but because the C/C++ libraries that Python is connected to are so good (thanks to the Boost team’s work).Most of the JVMs are written in C (or sometimes C++, but I’d bet strNeither of them.

Your question is like asking which angel is going to rule heaven - the answer is none.Language adoption is a precarious balance between developer gullibility, corporate gullibility, and the basic human tendency to underestimate the degree to which ennui and incompetence compel their never ending search for something sufficiently magical to conceal their own crippling lack of talent and ability.One thing is certain: languages come and go, but C reigns supreme. And when the inevitable heat death of the universe occurs, most likely brought about by excessive use of generic programming patterns and a critical mass of Singleton Factory Observer Listener Unit Decorators, we’ll rebuild it all: and write in C.",0 followers,Lucas Martin,6.4K,65,4.2M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-future-of-Java-developers-Will-they-compete-with-trending-technologies

14,"There are a number of factors in the increasing speed of innovation over the past 100 years. One of the main reasons technology development took off was higher economic productivity, especially in agriculture, which freed up workers to do other things, including innovating.Back around 1800, 90% of the labor force in the US was involved in agriculture. People were working full-time solely to feed themselves for the most part.By 1880, approximately 50% of the labor force was involved in agriculture, and the fraction kept dropping until it was 25% around 1930, and around 2% today.Initially agricuThere are a number of factors in the increasing speed of innovation over the past 100 years. One of the main reasons technology development took off was higher economic productivity, especially in agriculture, which freed up workers to do other things, including innovating.Back around 1800, 90% of the labor force in the US was involved in agriculture. People were working full-time solely to feed themselves for the most part.By 1880, approximately 50% of the labor force was involved in agriculture, and the fraction kept dropping until it was 25% around 1930, and around 2% today.Initially agriculture became more productive in large part due to the widespread availability of better materials, such as iron and steel. This allowed for the development of timesaving devices such as plows and reapers. In the 1900s alternate power sources started to replace human and animal effort, increasing productivity even further.The higher quality iron and steel also led to the advent of railroads, making shipping and travel much cheaper. And it also led to the development of machinery for factories and harnessing power from coal and oil, improving productivity even further. Since fewer and fewer people needed to work in agriculture to feed the rest of society, more people were available to work in factories, steel mills, on railroads, and in universities - all of which continued to be improved and led to further productivity gains. And things snowballed from there. This allowed for even more population growth because gains in health made survival through childhood much more likely and food was available. And these additional people have jobs that enhance productivity. World population went from 1 billion people in 1800 to around 7 billion people today.If you look at many of the jobs today, they're focused on increasing productivity. Anyone who is involved in IT or software development is trying to help companies and people do things that they were unable to before better, faster, and cheaper. Robots take the place of factory workers. Better vehicles and machinery require less maintenance and upkeep. Engineers are constantly improving upon existing products and developing new ones. Corporations have their own research departments, and there is more research going on at universities than ever before. People have higher levels of education than ever before. Corporations (and people) realize that they must continue innovating in today's society, otherwise competition will render them obsolete and non-competitive in short order.",0 followers,Naomi Green,523,4.9K,5.8M,2014,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-future-of-Java-developers-Will-they-compete-with-trending-technologies
