The ground underneath the pad (or at the bottom) would have to be angled, so that the flames don’t “bounce” back up, and cause additional heat or vibrations to that very rocket. Notice how right away, we introduced a couple new dangers to any healthy rocket plume:* We already had FLAME / FIRE / PLUME (PRESSURE!)And because of it, we must add the following two as main dangers during a rocket launch:* HEAT / TEMPERATURE(To give you an idea, I’ve posted a photo of thermite. The hottest man-made substance, reaches almost 4000 °F (2200 °C), and burns through asphalt and most everything else… The Shuttle’s SRBs burned at the same or a bit hotter temperatures… more on this below)* VIBRATION / SOUNDSo as we said, the first thing we need to do is deflect that mean hot flaming machine at an angle.Enter the Launch Pad TrenchThe pad’s trench was designed not only to be a stable launch platform for rockets (from Apollo to the Shuttle and on), but in being so it contains components that help maintain and improve that stability.The MFD (Main Flame Deflector): This is a ramp-like structure, at two different angles. One to deflect the Orbiter’s three SSME’s (Space Shuttle Main Engines), and the other side for the SRBs (Solid Rocket Boosters). These angles are based on studies, calculations, and the meat and potatoes of engineering, in order to help with the three dangers we’ve identified above.Here is an Apollo Era MFD:As mentioned above, the MFD photos shown from this point on will be for the Space Shuttle program, which will show one side of the Flame Face differently shaped/angled than the other.Watch NASA work super-fast at building the Shuttle-era MFD:How does the Trench and MFD look together as a whole in the pad?These are made of multi-layered reflective concrete, thermal tiles, and other materials. Of main concern is not just damage to the Trench for re-usability, but also the potential for FOD (Foreign Object Debris) or “chunks of stuff” flying out and potentially damaging the vehicle at its most critical stage.Now while that solution may help deflect the super-hot flame to the side, it sure does nothing to mitigate the pressure and sound/vibrations during the approximate four seconds that the Shuttle Assembly (commonly known as the stack) will spend in its influence.The study:After NASA failed to convince a lot of people and a few chimpanzees to stand under there with a thermometer during a shuttle launch, modifications to the MFD were made in order to be able to measure this amount of force affecting various areas of the MFD and trench.(this is probably a good time to notice the orbiter’s SSME flame face on the right, vs the much steeper angle of the SRB’s on the left). Shown also are the sensors that detected the amount of force during launch.The results were something like this.Heat rate after one second of launch (SRB’s):In terms of pressure, this is what was recorded after launch:What is 3660 psi (25.2 MPa) in terms of pressure? About 250 bars, or atmospheres. About 7 full-size elephants standing on an area the size of the palm of your hand. Except it would be 7 elephants for each time the palm of a hand fits in that center area pictured above.So 4000–5000 °F (2200–2800 °C) temperatures, 250 bars of pressure… what about vibrations?Another study tells us “Intense acoustic noise and vibration are unavoidable and undesirable by-products generated by the launching of a spacecraft, such as Space Shuttles. The generated noise during firing of rocket engines manifests itself to launch vehicle, sensitive spacecraft and launch pad in the form of airborne acoustics and structure-borne vibration. Therefore, a successful space mission requires thorough consideration of complex sound and vibration interaction of vibro-acoustics effects. The noise and vibration caused by spacecraft rocket engines on launch pads is extremely intense (approximately 180–190 dB) and produces vibration not only of the spacecraft vehicle but also of the launch tower and related support facilities. These vibration levels can be of sufficient magnitude to cause fatigue and eventual failure of some parts. The noise at launch (also during the two-minute liftoff and trans-sonic climb phase through the atmosphere from rocket exhaust and the turbulent boundary layer excitation, separated flows, wake flows and shocks) causes an hostile noise and vibration environment not only for the spacecraft itself but also for the delicate electronics and payload packages aboard. Then, the primary source of structural vibrations and internal loads during launch is due to these acoustic loads.” (Credit Revista chilena de ingeniería).Above we can see the typical vibration time history during a Space Shuttle launch.Above is a diagram describing the main noise and vibration response of pad structures induced by rocket launch.So to help mitigate some of these vibrations, the following is then introduced:The Water Sound Suppression System:Goes something like this (test, without the launch platform).Bubbles have the ability to absorb a remarkable amount of sound. As sound waves propagate through the water and encounter an air bubble, it causes the bubble to compress. The compression converts the sound energy into heat, substantially dampening the noise.NASA makes use of the effect by spraying water molecules into the surrounding air at the Mobile Launcher Platform. Similar to the compression of the bubbles, when water molecules encounter a sound wave, they begin to vibrate, converting the sound energy into heat.The water system protects massive rockets during launch. Seconds before launch, 16 nozzles create a cascade of water which absorbs most of the sound energy. The system is effective enough to reduce the noise by half. It reduces acoustical levels within the orbiter payload bay to about 142 decibels, below the design requirement of 145 decibels.At the time of liftoff, the flow rat...",324 followers,Mario Gravina,791,760,1.7M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Does-a-launch-pad-get-damaged-badly-due-to-the-heat-and-severe-flames-spewing-from-a-rocket-engine-during-launch-and-are-major-repairs-needed-afterwards

Although they were all civilians, the project was run by the US military. His military bosses were upset by the playful, “unmilitary” way he ran this group of people…so he taught them to do a kind of military ‘drill’ with their pencils. So on command, they’d lay their pencils on the edge of the desk - and in perfect synchronism whack one end with their hand so the pencil would flip up, twirl end-over-end and then be caught right in the correct place to begin writing. So when the general came around, Feynman would yell “Preseeeeeent PENCILS” and in perfect unison, 30 pencils would flip into the air and be ready to write!He used science for everything. After his wife died, and he went into some kind of a depression, he decided to use scientific methods to learn how to pick up women in bars!When he had a vacation, he’d take it by doing work in some totally different field - so normally, he did particle physics and such - but when he had a 2 week vacation, he’d go and work in a biology lab or something.Feynman was also a great teacher (unusual for great scientists) and his lectures on Physics 101 are still so great that the three volume set of books transcribed from them are still used in many Physics 101 courses today.His most famous thing was after the first Space Shuttle disaster. There was a committee formed to look into the problems. Feynman actually ignored most of the committee work and just wandered around talking to NASA engineers. He found that the “O-rings” in the shuttle SRB’s would fail to work adequately at cold temperatures - and the engineers who knew this couldn’t get themselves heard. So in front of a bazillion camera - and after a bunch of other committee members had blathered on about this and that - Feynman took a piece of O-ring material out of his pocket, clamped it in a small C-clamp and dunked it into the glass of iced water that had been provided for each of the committee members. After a few seconds, he pulled it out of the iced water, released the clamp and showed…right there…on live television - that the material didn’t expand as it needed to do.This demonstration - super-simple though it was - totally blew away thousands of pages of reports and graphs and who-knows-what.

A solitary insect just needs to inflict enough pain to escape, while a social insect needs to keep a predator away from the colony. If the predator learns that the pain is a lie, not indicating real damage, they might push through it to get to the honey or larvae the insect is protecting.It's pretty simple to quantify toxicity in a petri dish, but to test his hypothesis Schmidt needed to rank pain. This is less simple; tissue grown in a lab can't feel pain. So he did what any good scientist would do: be the test subject.He exposed himself to the stings of dozens of insects, recording a rating of 1 to 4, along with comments more appropriate to wine tasting than agony: A sweat bee's sting (1.0) is “light, ephemeral, almost fruity. As if a tiny spark has singed a single hair on your arm”, while a yellow jacket's (2.0) is “hot and smoky, almost irreverent. Imagine W. C. Fields extinguishing a cigar on your tongue”.

Watanabe’s report stated:Pigeons successfully learned to discriminate color slides of paintings by Monet and Picasso … they discriminated novel paintings by Monet and Picasso that had never been presented during the discrimination training.Furthermore, they showed generalization from Monet's to Cezanne's and Renoir's paintings or from Picasso's to Braque's and Matisse's paintings.Watanabe and his team won an Ig Nobel Prize for this, and rightly so.

This week’s post continues that theme with how a researcher created life. But not just any researcher – J. Craig Venter, now head of Synthetic Genomics Inc (SGI).I usually don’t read books about DNA, because I write books about DNA. But when offered a copy of Dr. Venter’s new book, Life at the Speed of Light, (Viking; publishing October 17), I couldn’t resist. Not just another tale of genome sequencing, Dr. Venter’s latest effort tackles synthetic biology – chemically creating a simple genome, then transferring it into a receptive cell minus its own genome. Creating life, plus sampling bits of various environments and trolling for genomes – metagenomics – are what he’s been up to since the human genome project days.91px-Captain_kirk_publicity_photoI raced through the book, flashing back to grad school with every historical anecdote or recounted experiment that built to the ability to recapitulate the genetic headquarters of a living cell. Venter’s excitement is palpable, if a little reminiscent of Captain Kirk: “We were now ready to attempt to go where no one had gone before, to create a whole bacterial synthetic genome and try to produce the first synthetic cell.”The tiny genome of Mycoplasma genitalium, the smallest of a free-living organism at a mere 582,970 bases, inspired the first synthetic genome. The story of creating the first synthetic genome-driven cell isn’t a gee-whiz, aren’t-we-brilliant narrative, because Venter intersperses the blind alleys and failures with the hard-won successes.A case in point: using Deinococcus radiodurans as a model for stitching together a genome, for this bacterium does just that after radiation shreds its genome to smithereens. It uses a superb repair system and conveniently has extra copies of its genome. Helpfully, Venter and his team at the Institute for Genomic Research (TIGR) had sequenced the organism’s genome in 1999 “Brilliant!” I thought. But then Venter wrote, “After a tremendous effort, we were forced to give up. We had hit a dead end and needed a new strategy.” The team eventually harnessed the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to test the synthetic genome.First came a synthetic chromosome, dubbed Mycoplasma genitalium JCVI-1.0. The final experiments sent the synthetic genome into different Mycoplasma, changing one species into another. Another glitch happened right near the end: a one-base deletion, which threw off the three-base reading frame, creating gibberish genomes. But correcting that glitch worked. The researchers even stitched their names into the recreated genome using a lexicon of DNA triplets corresponding to letters of the alphabet, used as “watermarks” to distinguish synthetic life from the old kind.The birth announcement for the first synthetic genome-driven cell came in the May 20, 2010 online edition of Science: Creation of a Bacterial Cell Controlled by a Chemically Synthesized Genome. It’s name: Mycoplasma mycoides JCVI-syn1.0.The first third of the book capture the discoveries and inventions leading up to creating synthetic life, while the middle third describes, sometimes in a bit too much detail for the average reader, the creation itself. The final third probes reactions and repercussions.Venter readily acknowledges the skeptics – I was among them – who posit that creating life means allowing the genome to fashion the cell around it, not take over an existing one like a hermit crab taking up residence in an abandoned shell. But even renting a cell rather than building one’s own is scary, because it skirts the constraints of natural selection. “Synthetic biology frees the design of life from the shackles of evolution,” Venter writes. The language veers towards the anthropomorphic, which tends to happen when trying to capture the wonder of evolution. But cells didn’t “cooperate” to build multicellular organisms. Evolution is an ebb and flow of surviving phenotypes based on selective pressure, perhaps tweaked by mutation and altered by genetic drift. It isn’t a willful striving.venter bookLike good science, Life at the Speed of Light raises more questions than it answers. Do we know enough to use synthetic life technology to create cells that can improve the world? Might one inventor’s idea of improvement become another’s weapon? What are unforeseen consequences of creating combinations of genes not seen in nature? Can the synthetic life community police itself, warding off what my grad school mentor Thom Kaufman called “triple-headed purple monsters” circa 1978, a time when the pioneers of recombinant DNA technology were establishing the containment procedures that persist today.Venter touches on the “dual use” threat, but focuses more on happier applications: vaccines that could head off a flu pandemic, alternatives to antibiotics, and new energy sources from unexplored parts of the planet and possibly beyond. If anyone could harness a Martian energy source, it would be he.I’ve had a few interesting encounters with Dr. Venter. The man has a Darth Vader-like reputation in some circles, but my fleeting contacts with him have been quite positive.Early in my career, when I was writing mostly for The Scientist and Genetic Engineering News, CV was always available to provide a quote, easy to reach on the phone in those pre-Internet and pre-genome days.512px-Craigventer2In 1999 he interviewed me, for a short writing gig – he’d wanted to create an atlas of normal, non-disease traits, only the genome hadn’t been sequenced just yet. Meeting him, walking down a hallway at Celera Genomics, I felt a bit like Dorothy approaching the great and powerful Wizard of Oz, but he wasn’t like that at all. Within minutes we were finishing each other’s sentences.A year later, mid-winter 2000, I faced a conundrum. The fourth edition of my human genetics textbook was due to be published in July, I could make no further edits after April, and I knew that the two teams sequencing the human genome were careening towards the finish line. Who would be first? When? And most importantly, would it be done by the fall, when my book would be in the hands of students?The government folks wouldn’t return my calls. CV emailed that he couldn’t tell me. I knew something was up. So, being in textbook mode, I sent him a test question:If I were to write, in a genetics book published in July 2000, that the human genome had been sequenced, would that be (a) True or (b) False. He answered.Some years later, Dr. Venter gave the closing talk at the American Society of Human Genetics annual meeting. Not too many were in attendance. CV described his risk variants for Alzheimer’s and cardiovascular diseases, and also announced that he learned that he has blue eyes, a preference for evening activities and novelty seeking, and a tendency towards substance abuse. “I can have two double lattes and wash it down with a Red Bull and not be affected by it,” he also learned from his genome sequence. Comparing his genome to that of DNA-discoverer Jim Watson, Venter quipped, “You probably wouldn’t suspect this based on our appearance, but we are both bald, white scientists.”dnaThrough it all, the expressed sequence tag saga from when he was at the NIH, through the human genome sequencing, what excited me the most about Craig Venter’s long research career was the sequencing of the Mycoplasma genome, an organism so stripped-down that it just might reveal the minimal gene set required for life. My textbook always included that idea. And being so small, Mycoplasma provided a goal should one want to try to create a living cell. And that’s what Dr. Venter and his many colleagues did. And again, it intersected my career.On May 20, 2010, I was attending the Presidential Symposium of the American Society of Gene and Cell Therapy’s annual meeting, in Washington DC. In a room packed with 2,000 geneticists, many crying, a 9-year-old boy walked onstage – Corey Haas had become able to see thanks to gene therapy. His story is the subject of my book The Forever Fix: Gene Therapy and the Boy Who Saved It (St. Martin’s Press, 2012).I’d wondered why the gene therapy press conference had been so poorly attended, and no obvious media at the historic presentation. Because across town, Craig Venter was announcing that he had created life, inspiring my blog post Creating Life and Curing Blindness.My most surprising recollection of a Venter talk was at the 4th International Meeting on Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms and Complex Genome Analysis, held in Stockholm on October 10-15, 2001. Attendance was down due to the recent attacks on September 11. The Scientist had sent me, back in the days when publications did that. CV not only showed up, but shocked the sparse crowd when, after he’d spoken for half an hour and predicted that human genome sequencing would one day take two hours, he grew suddenly silent.Craig Venter lowered his head for an uncomfortably long time as photos of Ground Zero flashed behind him. Said he, finally looking up but still not back at the screen, in tears, “these are difficult slides for me to look at, and they should be for you, too. I was there last week. The forensics officials asked Celera to help with the sequencing, to use our high-throughput methods to help identify remains for the families. So I took these photos.” Another long silence. “I never, ever thought we would have to do DNA forensics at this level, and for this reason.”","56,130 followers",Jean-Marie Valheur,680,3.4K,310.3M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Who-is-the-most-badass-scientist-in-modern-history

This was extremely daring, and yet Wallace survived a full four years collecting specimens in the Amazon - Bates spent a further seven before returning to England.During the last year of his trip, Alfred’s brother Edward joined the two friends in the Amazon. Tragically, they both caught yellow fever - Edward died, but Wallace recovered and soldiered on.On the voyage home, in 1852, Wallace was aboard the brigIn a letter to his friend, Richard Spruce, he describes poignantly the losses:My collections however were in the hold and were irrevocably lost. And now I begin to think, that almost all the reward of my four years of privation and danger were lost. What I had hitherto sent home had little more than paid my expenses and what I had in the “Helen” I calculated would realise near £500 [nearly $40,000]. But even all this might have gone with little regret had not far the richest part of my own private collection gone also. All my private collection of insects and birds since I left Pará was with me, and contained hundreds of new and beautiful species which would have rendered (I had fondly hoped) my cabinet, as far regards American species, one of the finest in Europe.You’d think that such a catastrophe, the ruin of one’s entire life work, would be pretty demotivating for a man. Not so for Wallace; in that same letter, written just two months after the shipwreck, he considers going to the Andes next, or the Philippines.Eventually, he settled on Indonesia and the surrounding regions - one of the least-explored places in the world at the time. During this expedition, which started in 1854, Wallace wasNot only this, but he is credited with the discovery ofOne time, he and several local friends had to altercate with a huge python which entered Wallace’s hut. It was allegedly over 4 metres in length, and he described it as being “well capable of swallowing a dog or a child.” This plate shows the python being unceremoniously extracted from the roof of the hut.The python’s skin is preserved today in a museum owned by the Linnean Society. The skins collected by Wallace and his loyal sidekick Ali (who later voluntarily adopted the surname Wallace) were under constant threat of loss. Many rotted, and on some islands they were plagued by ravenous stray dogs in the night who stole their specimens.Small animals were a big problem too. In 1858, four years into his trip, Wallace fell terribly ill with an attack of malarial fever. The illness was severely debilitating and he was confined to lie in his hut on a remote Indonesian isle for some time.And, believe it or not, it was during this time - of all times - that Wallace conceived the theory of evolution by natural selection, completely independent of Darwin! He wrote about it to Charles Darwin, who - unbeknownst to Wallace - had long been developing the same hypothesis in secret, for fear of ridicule.The two naturalists corresponded for years, and later became friends, or at least pen pals. Eventually, after a staggering 8 years in what was then a godforsaken, unexplored corner of the world, Alfred Russell Wallace decided to return to England in 1862, having become a rich man from selling his prized specimens.Seven years after coming home, Wallace wrote his world-famous book, perhaps the greatest of all the great Victorian travelogues -Again, his remarkable prolificness is clear - he, up until his death, wrote over 1,000 articles and 22 books; many of them defending the theory of natural selection from creationist skeptics. Many of his books are also still available today.Although he was not quite done travelling through wildernesses (he later explored the Rocky Mountains in Colorado), Wallace largely settled down after the end of his eight-year adventure. He died in 1913, at the age of 90, of natural causes.I think it’s clear to see that Alfred Russel Wallace was a man of many virtues - courageous, determined, optimistic, modest and above all very hard-working.

Almost a mythical hero, from the land of Hans Christian Andersen,Badassery Exhibit A: At age 20, refined Lord Rayleigh’s theory and methods of measuring surface tension of liquids.In 1905, a gold medal competition was sponsored by the Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters to investigate a method for measuring the surface tension of liquids that had been proposed by Lord Rayleigh in 1879. This involved measuring the frequency of oscillation of the radius of a water jet. Bohr conducted a series of experiments using his father's laboratory in the university; the university itself had no physics laboratory. To complete his experiments, he had to make his own glassware, creating test tubes with the required elliptical cross-sections. He went beyond the original task, incorporating improvements into both Rayleigh's theory and his method, by taking into account the viscosity of the water, and by working with finite amplitudes instead of just infinitesimal ones. His essay, which he submitted at the last minute, won the prize. He later submitted an improved version of the paper to the Royal Society in London for publication in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society.Badassery Exhibit B: Gave birth to a new physics.where R(H) is a constant, called the Rydberg constant for hydrogen (approximately 10967758 m^−1), and n1, n2 are just natural numbers (n2 > n1).For decades, no one could explain why this happens. Then, in 1911, Ernest Rutherford put forth his solar-system-like model of the atom: negatively charged electrons orbiting a positively charged nucleus. The main issue with this model was that it violates classical electrodynamics, which says that in such a system the electron would gradually lose its energy and spiral into the nucleus, thus making the whole system unstable. At this juncture, in 1913, Bohr had the seminal insight that the fixed wavelength values of hydrogen spectrum found by Balmer and Rydberg can be simply explained as energy emitted by electrons jumping from a higher-energy orbit to a lower-energy orbit. Applying Max Planck’s quantum theory to define the energy of the electron, he was able to calculate the value of the Rydberg constant for hydrogen which matched the experimentally observed value. Thus Bohr proposed a refined version of Rutherford’s model which stated that even though electronsThe implication of such a finding was momentous! It meant that classical mechanics, which had been successfully describing the motion of heavenly bodies (mostly) to the movement of most everyday objects, is woefully inadequate in explaining processes at the subatomic level, and must be superseded by a new physics — which is what we today call the Quantum Mechanics.Badassery Exhibit C: Transformed our understanding of the periodic table of elements.But of course, there were problems with this arrangement, for example, it was found that iodine is actuallyAt this juncture, the team of Bohr, Rutherford,At this time, Bohr, working withUsing these principles, they worked out the electron configurations of various elements, which looked like this:The pattern was unmissable!This fact that an element's physicochemical (macro) properties are nothing but manifestations of the arrangement of electrons in its atom (micro) is one of the most supremely important discoveries in the history of science, the ultimate confluence of physics and chemistry, and a triumph of quantum theory!! If it were to happen today, Bohr wouldBadassery Exhibit D: Stood up to Einstein to defend own theory, and prevailed.physical systems generally do not have definite properties prior to being measured, and quantum mechanics can only predict the probability distribution of a given measurement's possible results. The act of measurement affects the system, causing the set of probabilities to reduce to only one of the possible values immediately after the measurement.While many physicists were in a state of dismay and awe at the mathematical ingenuity of this theory, Einstein came out with strong disagreement. He simply refused to accept that physical realities could be just statistical probabilities and couldn’t be measured beyond a certain degree of accuracy, summed up in his famous remark “God doesn’t throw dice”. The Solvay Conference of 1927 brought this bitter conflict out in the open.Over dinner, during after-dinner discussions, and at breakfast, Einstein debated with Bohr and his followers on the question whether quantum mechanics in its present form could be called complete. Einstein illustrated his points with increasingly clever thought experiments intended to prove that position and momentum could in principle be simultaneously known to arbitrary precision. For example, one of his thought experiments involved sending a beam of electrons through a shuttered screen, recording the positions of the electrons as they struck a photographic screen. Bohr and his allies would always be able to counter Einstein's proposal, usually by the end of the same day… By 1928, the consensus was that Einstein had lost the debate, and even his closest allies… conceded that quantum mechanics appeared to be complete.But 3 years later, at the next Solvay Conference, Einstein came prepared for a smackdown…He proposed another thought experiment, known as Einstein’s Box.Einstein considers a box containing electromagnetic radiation and a clock which controls the opening of a shutter which covers a hole made in one of the walls of the box. The shutter uncovers the hole for a time Δt which can be chosen arbitrarily. During the opening, we are to suppose that a photon, from among those inside the box, escapes through the hole. In this way a wave of limited spatial extension has been created, following the explanation given above. In order to challenge the indeterminacy relation between time and energy, it is necessary to find a way to determine with adequate precision the energy that the photon has brought with it. At this point, Einstein turns to his celebrated relation between mass and energy of special relativity: E = mc^2. From this it follows that knowledge of the mass of an object provides a precise indication about its energy. The argument is therefore very simple: if one weighs the box before and after the opening of the shutter and if a certain amount of energy has escaped from the box, the box will be lighter. The variation in mass multiplied by c^2 will provide precise knowledge of the energy emitted. Moreover, the clock will indicate the precise time at which the event of the particle's emission took place. Since, in principle, the mass of the box can be determined to an arbitrary degree of accuracy, the energy emitted can be determined with a precision ΔE as accurate as one desires. Therefore, the product ΔEΔt can be rendered less than what is implied by the principle of indeterminacy.This challenge shell-shocked Bohr, “who, at first, could not think of a solution. For the entire evening he was extremely agitated, and he continued passing from one scientist to another, seeking to persuade them that it could not be the case, that it would have been the end of physics if Einstein were right; but he couldn't come up with any way to resolve the paradox”, remembers fellow attendee Leon Rosenfeld, “I will never forget the image of the two antagonists as they left the club: Einstein, with his tall and commanding figure, who walked tranquilly, with a mildly ironic smile, and Bohr who trotted along beside him, full of excitement.” (Below is an actual photo of this!)However, the next morning, Bohr dealt the knockout punch1. After emitting a photon, the loss of weight causes the box to rise in the gravitational field.2. The observer returns the box to its original height by adding weights until the pointer points to its initial position. It takes a certain amount of time t for the observer to perform this procedure. How long it takes depends on the strength of the spring and on how well-damped the system is. If undamped, the box will bounce up and down forever. If over-damped, the box will return to its original position sluggishly.3. The longer that the observer allows the damped spring-mass system to settle, the closer the pointer will reach its equilibrium position. At some point, the observer will conclude that his setting of the pointer to its initial position is within an allowable tolerance. There will be some residual error Δq in returning the pointer to its initial position. Correspondingly, there will be some residual error Δm in the weight measurement.4. Adding the weights imparts a momentum p to the box which can be measured with an accuracy Δp delimited by ΔpΔq ≈ h. It is clear that Δp < gtΔm where g is the gravitational constant. Plugging in yields gtΔmΔq > h.5. General relativity informs us that while the box has been at a height different than its original height, it has been ticking at a rate different than its original rate. The red shift formula informs us that there will be an uncertainty Δt = c^-2gtΔq in the determination of t0, the emission time of the photon.6. Hence, c^2ΔmΔt = ΔEΔt > h. The accuracy with which the energy of the photon is measured restricts the precision with which its moment of emission can be measured, following the Heisenberg uncertainty principle.Einstein never attacked the basics of the Bohr school of quantum mechanics again!Badassery Exhibit E: Outmaneuvered the NazisNow, one of these guys, James Franck, had kept his Nobel prize medal with Bohr for safekeeping, and so had the non-Jewish but vehemently anti-Nazi physicist Max von Laue. As German tanks finally rolled into Copenhagen (April 1940), keeping the two medals out of German hand was Bohr’s primary concern (he had donated his own medal to an auction for the benefit of a fund helping the war-affected Finns a few weeks before this). And just losing the medals was not the only worry! In Hitler’s Germany it was almost a capital offense to send gold out of the country. Since the names of the laureates were engraved on the medals, their discovery by the invading forces would have had very serious consequences for Bohr (and also for von Laue who was in Germany). Bohr knew that the Germans knew that certain Nobel laureates had kept their medals with Bohr and were determined to find them, hence he decided he couldn’t risk the medals being discoveredThey went to the chemistry lab, grabbed the supply of hydrochloric acid and nitric acid and mixed a deadly cocktail that was first mentioned by Arab alchemists a thousand years ago, called Aqua Regia — “regal water” — the only known liquid that can dissolve gold! Hurriedly dissolving the medals in the acid, they kept the flask in an ordinary place in the lab, amidst dozens of similar-looking flasks containing sundry chemical solutions! The Germans came, and ransacked the entire Institute for years looking for the medals, as Bohr stayed put at Copenhagen.The reason he could stay there, however, was because the German occupation of Denmark was by far the most peaceful of all Nazi-occupied countries. German propaganda even referred to Denmark as the ""model protectorate"". The king retained his throne and the Danish government continued to function…… and the Danes managed to exact an extraordinary price for this cooperation:Danish officials repeatedly insisted to the German occupation authorities that there was no ""Jewish problem"" in Denmark. The Germans recognized that discussion of the ""Jewish question"" in Denmark was a possibly explosive issue… the German Reich relied substantially upon Danish agriculture, which supplied meat and butter to 3.6 million Germans in 1942. As a result… even ideologically committed Nazis… followed a strategy of avoiding and deferring any discussion of Denmark's Jews.In mid-1943, however, having seen German defeats in Russia and North Africa, Danes began to show their displeasure with the occupation, in form of nationwide strikes and increased sabotage activities by the Danish resistance. Finally the German authorities gave the Danish government an ultimatum on August 28, demanding a ban on strikes, a curfew, and the punishment of sabotage with the death penalty. The Danish government rejected this demand and resigned the next day, resulting in direct administration of Denmark by the German authorities, who immediately drew up plans to start rounding up the Jews from early October. In response, the Jews started going into hiding, but that would not save them for long. The best way out was to get Sweden to offer them asylum till the end of the war but the Swedes refused to officially announce anything, in order to avoid increased confrontation with the Germans.In this situation, Bohr decided to throw his weight behind the issue. He contacted Danish resistance and planned an escape to Sweden. (Somehow the Nazis got wind of it and went after him at his home. As they entered through the front door, the 58-year-old Bohr ran out the back, with Danish resistance laying down cover fire, allowing him to slip out and get on a fishing boat!) As he reached Sweden, the government representatives told him that an aircraft was waiting to take him to United States where his expertise was needed in some “special government projects”. Bohr responded thatA massive rescue operation then began to smuggle the 7800-strong Danish Jewry across the Øresund, through the prying eyes of German patrol, and ultimately an estimated 7220 (plus 686 non-Jewish spouses) were able to reach the Swedish shores, making Danish Jews, out of the Jewish populations of all Nazi-occupied countries, the least affected by the Holocaust.Having secured the safety of the Danish Jews, Bohr finally decided to leave for the United States, via Britain. Stockholm was crawling with German agents, and there was a credible threat that he could be assassinated. To fly him to Britain over the dangerous North Sea, the British sent an unarmed Mosquito bomber, a light, fast aircraft that could fly high enough to avoid the German anti-aircraft batteries. At the opportune hour, Bohr donned a flight suit, strapped on a parachute, took delivery of the flight helmet with built-in earphones for communication with the cockpit, and lay on his back in the bomb bay. The pilot also supplied him with a stick of flares — in case the plane was hit and couldn’t make it to British mainland, the pilot was to open the bomb bay doors and drop Bohr into the sea; a following sea plane was then to pick him up…Ultimately, although those scenarios didn’t unfold, something did go wrong during the flight — the helmet given to Bohr turned out to be quite small, and he couldn’t wear it (“The Royal Air Force was not used to such great heads as Bohr’s”, quips Robert Oppenheimer!), hence when the plane reached high altitude and the pilot instructed Bohr to turn on the oxygen supply, he didn’t hear anything, and soon passed out due to lack of oxygen. Thankfully the pilot realized what had happened, and descended to a lower altitude, saving Bohr’s life!By the way, what happened to the two Nobel prize medals dissolved in aqua regia at Bohr’s Institute at Copenhagen? After the war, as Bohr and de Hevesy returned to the institute, they found that flask exactly as they had left it! They carefully extracted the gold from the solution and sent it to the Swedish Academy, with a letter explaining the situation — the Nobel Foundation then recast the medals from the same gold and re-presented them to Franck and von Laue!!!!!Badassery Exhibit F: Saved America’s plutonium bomb project.Badassery Exhibit G: Realized the far-reaching consequences of the atomic bomb, sought to bring the Russians in confidence “before there could be any question of use of atomic weapons” and proposed formation of an international body governing the use of nuclear energy, before anyone else.(Or perhaps, as an ardent believer in the philosophy of complementarity, Bohr could see more clearly than others how the promise of a lasting global peace and international concourse and even cleaner environment went hand in hand with the specter of utter ruin, in the context of unlocking the limitless energy of the atom.)Furthermore, whereas no top-level scientist or official in Britain/America could imagine that the Russians could get the bomb any time soon, Bohr happened to know better.In April 1944, he received a letter from [Russian Nuclear Physicist] Peter Kapitza, written some months before when Bohr was in Sweden, inviting him to come to the Soviet Union. The letter convinced Bohr that the Soviets were aware of the Anglo-American project, and would strive to catch up. He sent Kapitza a non-committal response, which he showed to the authorities in Britain before posting. Bohr met Churchill on 16 May 1944, but found that ""we did not speak the same language"". Churchill disagreed with the idea of openness towards the Russians to the point that he wrote in a letter: ""It seems to me Bohr ought to be confined or at any rate made to see that he is very near the edge of mortal crimes.""In America, however, Oppenheimer did see Bohr’s point, and suggested him to speak to POTUS!In that meeting (August 1944), Bohr submitted to Roosevelt what Churchill had failed to grasp: “Roosevelt was more understanding than Churchill and advised Bohr to return to Britain to get their approval, as he could not take this decision on his own. However, in 3 weeks’ time, Roosevelt and Churchill had a meeting, where they discussed Bohr’s proposals, andEven after being snubbed by short-sighted, xenophobic, jingoistic politicians, Bohr kept trying. Between 1945 and ’48, he wrote several memos to US statesmen, and even met the Secretary of State, but all his warnings/suggestions were summarily ignored.And then… everything changed.On September 1,1949, the US Air Force Office of Atomic Energy found the first evidence of a Soviet nuclear test (actually conducted, in utter secrecy, 3 days earlier), sending shockwaves (figuratively speaking!) through Truman administration, from which they took 3 weeks to recover in order to announce the news to public! With the people in power finally forced to pay attention, Bohr decided to put together all his thoughts about how to deal with this most extraordinary crisis in the history of our species, in an “Open Letter”, presented to the United Nations on June 9, 1950. The letter was not just “open” in name but also in spirit, and substance! In it, he candidly talked about his own failure to convince the British/American leaders about the dangerous consequences of them unilaterally developing nuclear weapons and then using them in war without sharing any information with the Soviets and greater international community, and also alleged that this discretion was a key reason behind the deepening divide between the wartime allies despite conciliatory efforts of the UN:When the war ended and the great menaces of oppression to so many peoples had disappeared, an immense relief was felt all over the world. Nevertheless, the political situation was fraught with ominous foreboding. Divergences in outlook between the victorious nations inevitably aggravated controversial matters arising in connection with peace settlements. Contrary to the hopes for future fruitful co-operation, expressed from all sides and embodied in the Charter of the United Nations, the lack of mutual confidence soon became evident. The creation of new barriers, restricting the free flow of information between countries, further increased distrust and anxiety.He asserted that for our civilization to endure, and progress, in the nuclear age, nations must embrace a culture of “mutual openness” and “genuine cooperation”(It’s interesting to note that this letter coincided with theLastly, he prescribed the creation of an international organization for monitoring and controlling the nuclear activities of every nation:Any arrangement which can offer safety against secret preparations for the mastery of the new means of destruction would… demand extraordinary measures. In fact, not only would universal access to full information about scientific discoveries be necessary, but every major technical enterprise, industrial as well as military, would have to be open to international control…. Detailed proposals for the establishment of an effective control would have to be worked out with the assistance of scientists and technologists appointed by the governments concerned, and a standing expert committee, related to an international security organization, might be charged with keeping account of new scientific and technical developments and with recommending appropriate adjustments of the control measures.7 years later, the world finally had to create this organization:The same year (1957), Bohr was honored with the first ever Atoms For Peace award.Badassery Exhibit H: Co-founded CERN.In June 1950, the same month he submitted his open letter to the UN, a resolution was tabled at UNESCO to ""assist and encourage the formation of regional research laboratories in order to increase international scientific collaboration"".

Her name isThis is her doing her morning routine: paddle boarding in Jakarta bay while sipping a cup of coffee accompanied by a cigarette.Susi Pudjiastuti - WikipediaShe was born in Pangandaran in the south coast of West Java province from a very dirt poor beginning. The family struggled to feed and educate her. Because of this, she developed a keen sense of entrepreneurship early on. When she was still in high school she decided to make her own luck and started to sell fish in the local market. Her humble business started to grow immediately. She didn’t even finish high school because of this.Being a high school dropout didn’t prevent her from growing her business. In fact, her business has grown tremendously over the years. She even owned an air logistics company aptly namedThis company provided logistical services to many parts of the archipelago and was responsible for carrying tens of millions of Dollars worth of fresh sea food to their destinations.It's this no nonsense and professional approach to her work that made Indonesia's president elect Joko Widodo choose her for the post of fishery minister. She's perfect for it.Under her leadership Indonesia's maritime industry experienced a massive shake up. No longer being “raped"" by illegal boats from neighboring countries, Indonesia's sea has now recovered much of its fish stocks and the country has overtaken its neighbors in fish productions and export. Look at this table from 2015.In just one year (2014–2015) Indonesia's fishery trade account overtook those of Vietnam and Thailand. In fact, the trade account from both countries collapsed immediately after madam Susi took over the helm of the fishery ministry. How? By using this:She's not afraid of using force and scare tactics to drive off illegal fishing boats from Indonesian waters.The result is swift and long lasting. To this day, the number of illegal fishing cases in the country have dropped significantly. Even neighboring countries are begging for Indonesia to stop destroying their boats.Madam Susi's reply to the cry from neighboring countries?She has done a wonderful job in protecting the country's maritime wealth. Even the international community is acknowledging her work.But not everything is smooth sailing. Other ministers and politicians are jealous of her achievements, and some of them even tried publicly to undermine her work. The most notorious is him, Mr. Luhut Panjaitan, her boss! (a coordinating minister).Strange how some men react negatively when a women does a much better job than them.As if all of that weren't enough, in early 2016 her oldest son died at the age of 31 due to a sudden heart attack in Florida.The entire nation was shocked and everybody's was worried about what would happened to madam Susi. She's a mother in mourningToday madam Susi is the most popular minister in Indonesia. She has experienced many things in her life including death of a son and political backstabbing. And yet despite the massive setbacks she persevere and continue to do her work in service for her nation.If that's not badass enough than I don't know what is.All pics courtesy of Google",104 followers,Amritbir Singh Bhutta,672,67,79.3K,2018,https://www.quora.com/Who-is-the-most-badass-scientist-in-modern-history

Originally assigned to a non combat role, and he quickly rose to the rank of Captain. Eventually though, all luck runs out, and Salomon was assigned to Saipan as a regimental surgeon. One day, in the chaos of battle Salomon was surprised when a Japanese soldier rushed into his field hospital and bayoneted a patient. His position had been overrun, he, a lone surgeon, was alone.Salomon shot the Japanese soldier and continued to feverishly work on his patients. Two more Japanese soldiers rushed in, he shot them both. Immediately four more soldiers crawled under the tent flap. Salomon rushed them kicked the knife out of another's hand, bayonetting the second and headbutted the last one to submission. He ordered his wounded out of the tent and promised to hold off the advancing Japanese hordes. The last that was seen of the reportedly meek, peaceful dentist, was an image burned into the minds of the wounded he was saving. Salomon stood alone, the last of an original five man machine gun outpost that he had joined, weilding a water cooled machine gun mowing down hordes of advancing Japanese troops.After the battle Salomon’s body was recovered, he was surrounded by ninety-eight Japanese bodies, and had 70 bullet wounds, many of which he seemed to have shrugged off. Alone Salomon had held off a Japanese advance for an extended period of time, saving the lives of the 33 wounded in his tent. For his unparalleled valor in the face of overwhelming odds (his position was attacked by 3,000–5,000 Japanese soldiers) posthumously awarded him the Medal of Honor. Coincidentally, he was the third Jewish soldier to win the Medal of honor, and- believe it or not- the first dentist.Rest in peace Captain Benjamin L.

Sorry, it’s just how it works.”Zongchang walked his talk too. He proved himself to be one of the better military generals in the Fengtian clique. He used armored trains to transport his troops and resources across battlefields.Those trains were guarded by White Russian mercenaries that came to China as refugees of the Russian Civil War. Zongchang dressed them up in full Tsarist Uniforms and regalia.Y’know, just to remind them of their past that collapsed right before their fucking eyes. BecauseZongchang was progressive, too. He recruited White Russian women to form a regiment entirely composed of nurses. These nurses then went around and taught all of Zongchang’s soldiers basic first aid, so every soldier could also qualify as a medic.This boosted morale tremendously and effectively made Zongchang’s force almost unstoppable.During the second Fengtian-Zhili war, Zongchang helped partition Shanghai only months after he participated in 1924. By 1925, he had conquered Shanghai proper.A major city/district that was heavily contested. Conquered. In a year.He was so confident in his battle ability that every time he left for a battle, he said he’d either come back victorious or in a coffin.So when he lost the battle, the motherfucker paraded his entire battalion around the Shangdong province, while he himself was at the middle of the parade, laid in a coffin, smoking a large cigar.He also brought his elderly mother in battles, valuing her advice more than generals who were trained in this business all their lives.And it gets better!Zongchang also had another reason to keep all those nurses.He was shagging half of them.In addition to those nurses, Zongchang had 50 concubines, all of different nationalities.Because he didn’t speak their language or know their name, he just assigned numbers to them!Send Number 23 to the tent.Zongchang was protective of these concubines as well.He shot the cousin of former Chinese Emperor Puyi because he was under the suspicion that he was banging one of his concubines.When tried about this in court, he just said he was cleaning his rifle, and the shot was a misfire,The man literally got away with murder before it was cool.I think the final nail in the coffin was when there was a drought in the Shangdong Province.So, Zongchang goes up to the temple of the storm god, Zhang, who was like Jesus to the people of Shangdong.As Zongchang arrived in the idol room of the temple, he saw that there were a lot of disciples praying.Zongchang elegantly weaved through the crowd, making sure not to disturb any of the disciples in their prayer.He went up to the idol of the storm god,fucking bitchslapped it,and said, and I quote:“Fuck your sister! How dare you make Shangdong’s people suffer by not giving us rain!”And promptly left.The next day, he ordered his artillery regiment to fire into the sky until it rained.It rained the next day.If that’s not badass, I don’t know what is.Sources:The Profane Poetry Of Zhang Zongchang - This Site Is Best ViewedCount Dankula’s video on Zhang Zongchang.",UNKNOWN,Vibhakar T S (ವಿಭಾಕರ್ ಟಿ ಎಸ್),905,1.3K,18M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Who-is-the-most-badass-scientist-in-modern-history

The third series, Gunnm: Martian Chronicle, is still ongoing.The first manga series, Gunnm, ends with Gally being killed by Desty Nova. But Nova didn’t do it out of spite, he did it so he could get Gally’s brain matter and bring it into Salem, where he revived her. He did this because he is studying Karma and wanted to see what an ultimate being with the power to do anything could do once she is free from the Wheel of Karma. So he puts Gally into the most powerful body he could make (the Imaginos Body) and overclocks her brain to 150 times its original speed. This essentially turns Gally into a god.She is fully capable of breaking the speed barrier and can see everything happening in slow motion.Instead of destroying Salem, though, she decides to save it after the super computer governing Salem, Melchizedek, goes berserk and decides to kill itself by destroying Salem and the orbital elevator connecting it to Jeru in space.Desty Nova gives Gally a catalyst which she can use to change her body into whatever substance or form she imagines. She then uses her hypersonic speed to run up the orbital elevator and literally turns herself into superglue to keep the elevator and Salem from crashing into the Scrapyard below, sacrificing her life so that all her friends can live.Gally’s final thoughts as she becomes the galactic super glue are of nature and greenery, and she turns the entire orbital elevator structure into a gigantic tree of life with a buddhic lotus flower in space. (this is why the American release renames Jeru and Salem to Ketheres and Tiphares — people familar with the Kaballa will understand why).She lives like that for several decades until the tree of life regenerates her body with a little help from Desty Nova, and she is recovered by her lover Figure Four for a happy ending.That is how the first manga series ends. The second series, Last Order, retcons that entire ending so it can continue the story after Gally wakes up in Salem. Last Order though is basically the “extended telling” of the original ending, and ends with Gally becoming a galactic flying jellyfish in order to prevent a space ship from crashing onto Mars and killing countless innocent lives. She fuses with the space ship onion frame using her nanomachine Imaginos body at the behest of the two supercomputers Melchizedek and the Jupiter Super Computer, in order to save the people on Mars.She then disappears for a long time. During this time, Figure Four and Ido go on a search to find the missing Gally, and end up traveling together to find her.At this point, Gally technically does not have her human brain anymore because it was swapped out by Desty Nova for a microchip brain, similar to the one Ido has as a result of the Salem initiation ceremony which removes people’s brains.However, her real brain was kept by Nova and it somehow ended up in the Unanimous system of Melchizedek, which is basically 20,000 organic brains run in a network. Last Order ends with Gally wishing for her original brain to have a real body, and live on happily with Figure Four. So she makes preparations before fusing with the space ship so that her final wish, to have her brain live on happily as a human.Gally’s servants work to retrieve her original brain from the Unanimous system and use Nova X and Jeru’s advanced technology to regenerate her body using her DNA, and implant her brain into it. Figure waits patiently as this is done and gets the girl and a happy ending.","16,670 followers",Lee Thé,1.1K,10.1K,80.7M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Does-a-launch-pad-get-damaged-badly-due-to-the-heat-and-severe-flames-spewing-from-a-rocket-engine-during-launch-and-are-major-repairs-needed-afterwards
