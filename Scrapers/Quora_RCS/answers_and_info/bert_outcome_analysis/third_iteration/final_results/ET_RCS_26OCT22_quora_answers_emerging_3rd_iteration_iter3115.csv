By splitting the question I get a frame of reference and then the answer becomes fairly straight forward to comprehendThe answer to the first question is straight forward and India is much advanced compared to where we were in 2000. I am not going to elaborate this further because its for us to see. But should we be happy about it? That leads us to my second questionWhile it is true that India has advanced immensely in the last 20 years, the real question is has this made us more dependent on other countries? Most notably the United States and recently China?Despite having a population of 1.3 billion people and being touted as the software superpower (thanks to the IT services industry) not so long ago, India does not have self-reliance when it comes to technology. China created companies like Ali Baba, Baidu and Tencent a parallel to the American tech giants while India (even India’s telecom minister recently) takes pride in being the largest consumer of Whatsapp, and Facebook! Yes almost everyone has a mobile phone in India today and therefore the opportunities for growth is tremendous. But the real question one should ask is, who will be the beneficiaries of these opportunities? The mobile phones used in India are Chinese phones and the software used in these phones are U.S owned. Basically all our data, from our shopping habits to our entertainment preferences are in the hands of foreign technology companies. Now we know IoT is catching up fast and that means more control to these companies and India will be a proud consumer supplying data.One of the many important aspects discussed in Rajiv Malhotra’s latest book “Artificial Intelligence and the Future of Power, Five Battlegrounds” is India’s military dependence on foreign technology. While the manufacturing of Rafale jets will happen in India, the technology is owned by the French and let’s understand when such technology transfers occur between countries, the supplying country will always provide a technology that is one generation behind to the consuming country. That means we are technologically and militarily advanced compared to our previous generations but we are at least one generation behind the innovating countries! In certain areas like military that is not good newsMy last point on this is our pride in our Human resource and how skilled we are! Yes as individuals many Indians are CEOs of big foreign tech giants. But how does that benefit India as a nation? Do we have a stake in the intellectual property of these products? Can we say for instance Sunder Pichai as Google’s CEO holds the same clout in his company as Mark Zuckerberg holds in Facebook? Certainly not! Let’s not confuse individual brilliance with technological advancement as nation.For India to have a grand standing in the world stage as a technologically advanced nation, we need to come out of our consumer mindset and to quote Rajiv Malhotra’s words “be producers of knowledge and technology”.","68,777 followers",Kanthaswamy Balasubramaniam,898,17.3K,413.3M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-job-would-you-like-to-bring-back-from-the-era-before-advanced-technology

Australia Declared war on Germany on September the 3rd also.Australia was there, right from the start.But there, the divergence begins. For instance - there were no Australians at Dunkirk.In the famous and photogenic ‘Battle of Britain,’ pilots were mostly British, Canadian, Kiwis and Poles, so another historical photo op was missed for Australia.In the founding myths of world war 2 the Aussies were absent.Sir Keith Park, a Kiwi, as Air Vice Marshall was responsible for the fighter defence of London and southeast England during the battle of Britain. He has a memorial statue in London.The first Australian aircrew trained under the ‘Empire Training Scheme’ did not begin to arrive until late 1940. They missed the battle of Britain - which ran until the end of October of that year.After that time 27,899 Australian aircrew soldiered on, fighting in the European and Mediterranean theatres, but having missed the ‘Battle of Britain’ they pretty much missed the limelight. Many were killed, wounded and captured but their contribution is now relegated to dusty books, forgotten newsreels and crumbling cenotaphs.Australian aircrew No. 460 squadron RAAF with Lancaster bomber. RAF Station Binbook 1944. Pretty much forgotten.On the naval front, Australia only had approximately 13 Naval ships in 1939, I say approximately as it is not known how many tugs, survey and other lesser ships the RAN (Royal Australian Navy) may have had at that point. I’m guessing not many.By June 1945 the RAN totalled 337 ships. It was a massive effort.The RAN served in all theatres, at first mostly in support of the British Royal Navy, while many significant actions were fought by the RAN, few or none have caught the eye of today’s public. There was no sinking of the battleship Bismarck (that was the Brits), no mauling of - then fooling the Cruiser Graf Spee into scuttling itself - that was also the Brits (and the Kiwis).Kiwis aboard HMS Achilles make sure the Graf Spee really is dead. January 1940.The large ships of the RAN were redeployed to defend Australia in 1941 after the Japanese attacked. Again, they tended to be blended with, at first the RN - then later the USN, as part of a larger force their contributions were, well, subsumed, and have been minimised over time.The battles in the Pacific and Indian Oceans saw Australia lose the cruisers HMAS Sydney (with all hands, 645 men), the Perth and then the Canberra. These were major losses, but again are somewhat forgotten by the world when compared to the loss of the the RN’s Hood (sunk by the Bismarck) , then the Prince of Wales and the Repulse (both sunk in a naval massacre by Japanese aircraft).HMAS Sydney, lost with all hands.Australia’s Armed forces had a total of 730,000 members during world war 2. Initially the 2nd AIF (standing for Australian Imperial Force - the 1st AIF was in world war one) fought in the Western Desert, defeating and then rounding up thousands of Italians as prisoners. This today is seen as a prelude to the ‘real fighting’, which occurred later on, a mere sideshow.8th January 1941, Australians ‘herding’ Italian prisoners taken at Bardia. The Australians took 65,000 Italians prisoner in less than a month! Some sideshow…They also fought in Greece and the island of Crete with the British and the Kiwis, both campaigns were costly failures, with thousands of Australians and other allied combatants being killed or captured.In Syria and Lebanon the Australian 7th and some of the 6th Divisions were a key part of the allied force involved fighting the Vichy French, Australian troops took Beirut in July 1941. An armistice with the French soon followed.Fighting your former allies is never a particularly popular thing, it doesn’t capture the imagination, possibly this is why no one really remembers this campaign.With the Arrival of Rommel, the German ‘Desert Fox’, Australians of the 9th Division were involved in the defence of Tobruk in 1941 and both the first and second battles of El Alamein in 1942. Rommel had this to sayAustralian troops in the 2nd battle of El AlameinIn Africa the Germans were now on the back foot. Under Montgomery the 2nd Battle of El Alamein had been won. In November 1942 Operation Torch bought Americans into battle, the Germans were now caught between the 2 forces. They were essentially ready for slaughter, not an easy slaughter of course, being Germans - but their defeat was inevitable.American troops with German officer captives - another bad day for the Afrika Korps.The time was ripe for the Australians to do what they do best. In the first world war they were - with the Canadians - considered the ‘shock troops of the Empire’. This was their moment.But the 2nd AIF, having put in the ‘hard yards’ as they say, was leaving…The Japanese were pressing towards Australia, The ‘fortress’ of Singapore having fallen 8 months before. Successively in the battles in Malaya, Singapore, Rabaul, Ambon and Timor the 2nd AIF’s 8th Division, 20,000 men, had been wiped out.The Australian troops in the Western Deserts and the Middle East were now needed at home.The arrival of American forces in Africa also brought Hollywood, the popular history of the war was about to be written in film - and from an American perspective - the Australians were not going to be a part of it.The fate of the 2nd AIF was to be something different.They were going to be buried in the jungle for the next 3 years, often literally.In March 1942 the Japanese landed on the North Coast of New Guinea, Eastern New Guinea was at that time administered by Australia - so this was an invasion of Australian territory. New Guinea was seen as mainland Australia’s last line of defence.By early 1943 the AIF was home, fighting the Japanese. On a front that was, if anything, an afterthought to the rest of the world.The New Guinea campaign was shocking in its savagery, the Japanese murdered most captured Australians and the Australians responded in kind. The battles were not only against the enemy but against the jungle itself, mosquitoes, mud, disease and difficulty of supply.March 1944, Australian soldier in the Finisterre Range New Guinea.200,000 Japanese troops died in New Guinea. Around 7000 Australians and the same number of US servicemen also died.By mid 1943 the Australian forces were on the offensive in New Guinea, along with US forces they very slowly began to wind back the Japanese forces, working their way torturously up the Northern coast of New guinea.Australian forces remained engaged fighting the Japanese until their surrender in 1945. But from 1944 onwards the Australians were relegated to secondary roles, replacing US forces and ‘mopping up’ Japanese forces in New Guinea, New Britain and Bougainville.Australians ‘Mopping up’ in Bougainville island 1944.In May to July of 1945 the Australians were involved in the invasion of Borneo with US troops.AIF 24th brigade Landing in Labuan, Borneo 10th June 1945.You really have to wonder (and many did) if the operations by the Australian army in New Guinea and numerous islands in 1944 and ’45 made any operational sense.The Japanese they fought were mostly cut off and trapped on the islands on which they fought to the death. Their supplies were being interdicted by the subs, surface ships and aircraft of the allies.Some reportedly resorted to cannibalism to survive. It didn’t seem to make any sense to kill them any quicker.A relative of mine was still fighting them in the islands at wars end in 1945. He had fought them since June 1942, and seen indescribable horrors. But he told of sitting, sick and hungry, in a foxhole and described listening to “Japs” sobbing at night in their own foxholes. ”Those poor bastards” he called them. He had reached the point where in spite of all the horrors he just felt sorry for them.On this map none of Australia’s hard won land victories even gets a mention as a “major battle”.So essentially, that is what happened to Australia’s armed forces in WW2, theEveryone else got to win the Battle of Britain, beat the Afrika Korps, flatten Monte Cassino, land at Normandy and race for Berlin. Or win at midway and storm Iwo Jima.The Aussies got to play backup for everyone. Then slug it out for years in the mud, jungles and mountains of New Guinea and associated islands, fighting hundreds of thousands of Japanese who, after 1943, were dead men anyway.Australia’s armed forces at 730,000 during the war represented around 10% of the population. “As a proportion of its population, the Australian Army was ultimately one of the largest Allied armies during World War II”“Of those on active service, 27,073 were killed in action or died, 23,477 were wounded, and 30,560 were taken prisoner of war. Of those taken prisoner, 8296 died in captivity.”",40 followers,Bill Blinky,3.3K,0,0,2021,https://www.quora.com/If-the-Predators-fought-a-war-against-the-Klingons-who-would-win-Both-live-for-combat-have-an-honor-based-code-and-have-advanced-technology
19,"The UK didn't have the industrial capacity to mass produce such technology. So the proximity fuze, radar, penicillin, jet engines, etc. were turned over to Uncle Sam with the proviso they get shipments of the devices. Proximity fuzes and radar went to Raytheon in Cambridge Massachusetts. Antibiotics went to Pfizer in Brooklyn New York. Jet engines went to General Electric in Schenectady New York. However Uncle Sam really screwed the Brits over the nukes.The UK didn't have the industrial capacity to mass produce such technology.

But for this, I’ll make an acception. See, I have a special soft spot for the Australians in WWII. Not because they were the most badass soldiers or had the best ships of the war or anything like that, but because of what they did.So, here, I’ll tell you something I want you to imagine. Imagine you’re a part of the crew on USS Portland, CA-33, which has just fought in what I refer to as the Night Cruiser Action. You’ve just taken heavy damage from a Japanese torpedo, which has blown off your inboard screws (some people call them propellers, those people are wrong) and jammed your B turret in both train and elevation and managed to get your rudder jammed in a 5 degree position to starboard (to the right). Your ship can’t go more than 19 knots (21 mph, 35 kmph), and you really need repairs. You could risk going back to Pearl Harbor, but the likelihood is that you’ll either get struck by another torpedo from a submarine (which, as we learned from Portland’s sister ship, Indianapolis, is not a healthy thing for a Portland class heavy cruiser), get harassed by Japanese aircraft, which are still a serious threat, or have a system on the ship fail and have your ship sink in the middle of the pacific. On the flip side, you could just head to Australia, which is much closer and reduces the chances of your ship meeting any three of the horrible deaths I just mentioned. It’s almost a no brainer, and many captains took their ship to Australia for temporary repairs.Australia was positioned in an absolutely excellent spot for damaged US ships to go during those early campaigns in the Pacific in WWII, and one of the most important things they did was help repair any allied ships. However, do not take this as me saying that’s all they were good for. Their soldiers fought just as hard and for much longer than any US troops, their sailors gave up just as much as any USN sailor, and their people sacrificed just as much, and many times more than any US civillian.",140 followers,Blake Chesledon,6.4K,0,0,2020,https://www.quora.com/If-the-Predators-fought-a-war-against-the-Klingons-who-would-win-Both-live-for-combat-have-an-honor-based-code-and-have-advanced-technology
