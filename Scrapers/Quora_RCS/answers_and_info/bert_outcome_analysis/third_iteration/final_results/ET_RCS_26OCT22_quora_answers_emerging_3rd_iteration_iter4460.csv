0,"At first, it was the light at the end of the minimum wage tunnel I had been stuck in for decades. It was also the thing that enabled me to be present to raise my own child as a single mother, and get a landlord to lease me an apartment. My full time wages plus overtime at McDonald’s, Starbucks, The Gap, The Children’s Place, and everywhere else I was an hourly employee were never quite as much as what I could make on my own. I’m not claiming to be well off or even, middle class, but I’m not homeless like I was when I was making lattes for a living.

It was also the thing that enabled me to be present to raise my own child as a single mother, and get a landlord to lease me an apartment. My full time wages plus overtime at McDonald’s, Starbucks, The Gap, The Children’s Place, and everywhere else I was an hourly employee were never quite as much as what I could make on my own. I’m not claiming to be well off or even, middle class, but I’m not homeless like I was when I was making lattes for a living. God bless Starbucks, they try, a lot harder than a lot of corporations do, but no one can live on $13/hour in the United States, let alone two people. Being self employed for two whole years now on this latest endeavor, home delivery from the car I used to live in with my son, I’m filled with a sense of pride that I am somehow able to provide a life for my tiny family of two that a multibillion dollar corporation never could (or would). I don’t have to walk into a building at 7am for my morning reaming from some divorced covert narcissist named Keith, I do all my own reaming, now. I’m way harder on myself than Keith could ever be. Unlike my former job and my working relationship with the failed pizzateur Keith, independent contracting does not come with a set schedule, or trying to cover a shift from a small pool of managers while my grandmother actively has a heart attack in the background (true story). I can take a day off to be inexplicably ill all over myself, like today, or to have an impromptu meeting with my urologist. I would have to give at least two weeks’ notice to ask off for a doctor’s appointment in any corporate position. If I need a week off because I’m sick, or I needed a sudden medical procedure, I don’t have to call some chode and ask for permission to be incapacitated. I am the Head Chode in Charge now.Of course, being my own boss presents its own sphere of challenges. I saw this meme somewhere on Quora before and I saved it, because it’s so true. This has been my adult working life. Now I’m 45, almost 46, with a bunch of student loans to pay off, looking back at my wasted decades of working hard, going above and beyond, and working through every illness so I could later become chronically ill with an autoimmune disease from too much stress…“The company will notice, and separate. Terminate.” There. I fixed it. Now, when there’s anxiety about work, it’s all mine to own. I can’t just walk away from the problems like clocking out at Starbucks. I no longer have $6 short term disability coverage, or any, because insurers find my job “too dangerous” and would only cover me via a corporate sponsor (according to Mutual of Omaha). I am required to pay a higher percentage of income tax than people who aren’t self employed and my tax forms are way more complicated than they used to be. I’m much less likely to receive any tax refund. If the “equipment” I use breaks down, whether that’s my car or my physical body, I have to be responsible for fixing it, I can’t just call a hotline or delegate the task to someone else. Business can also be very inconsistent, especially these days, so being self employed requires a lot of passion to get through all the extra work and dedication required. I also find myself working through at least one of the standard two days off a week, if not both. There’s no paid vacation or sick time. So, it’s definitely a trade off, but one that I find worth the effort because it is more rewarding in the long run. You can’t put a price on autonomy.","72,248 followers",Rohan Kamath,4K,213,29.3M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-is-a-good-technology-inspired-reason-to-engage-in-a-self-employment-venture-today

2,"In 2003 I was working for Cisco Systems and at the time we learned that the US Department of Defense had worked with Intel and other chip manufacturers to install in their hardware the ability to remotely disable any device using their technology with a certain radio frequency. Supposedly, this technology was used to help cripple the Iraqi air defense system when the US invaded.This was important to Cisco because we were working in security and cryptography and the NSA was forever trying to get us to corrupt our products so they could un-encrypt foreign transmissions on the fly. One time we weIn 2003 I was working for Cisco Systems and at the time we learned that the US Department of Defense had worked with Intel and other chip manufacturers to install in their hardware the ability to remotely disable any device using their technology with a certain radio frequency. Supposedly, this technology was used to help cripple the Iraqi air defense system when the US invaded.This was important to Cisco because we were working in security and cryptography and the NSA was forever trying to get us to corrupt our products so they could un-encrypt foreign transmissions on the fly. One time we were required to corrupt product that had been shipped to China and it started a major debate about our fiduciary responsibility to the country or to the customer. The issue was that if you sell a security product that you know is corrupted, you are knowingly committing fraud and are liable. As the Product Manager at the time I asked the NSA if they would stand behind us (and me as I might be personally liable) in court if we were discovered. Of course the answer from the NSA was “Hell no.”We were on our own. We then entered into a long debate about how to detect Easter eggs and other corruption introduced into security products unknowingly through another vendor’s corrupted hardware. The issue was never resolved but it should be known that our security source code HAD to be provided to the NSA in order to get FIPS certification and they made certain changes to it.So to answer your question, USA military technology is advanced far beyond anyone’s knowledge to describe the extent.On the other hand, the Chinese probably know more about our technology than we do since they perpetrated the greatest security breach in history by compromising the RSA key technology used by almost everyone in the world. We only learned of it through the vigilance of Lockheed-Martin who discovered the breach accidentally. But for months the Chinese had the key to almost every computer in the world.","62,885 followers",Jay Bazzinotti,2.5K,22.2K,179.7M,2017,https://www.quora.com/How-advanced-is-drone-technology-in-a-military-engagement-between-superpowers

Always end it with the team fired up or at least on a positive note.As the figures role in throughout the day - and then give team performance feedback for the last five or ten minutes of the shift.I am not a big believer in having a meeting for every single issue that crops up. I've only known unsuccessful managers that spend all their time in one to one meetings. It can create a decisive atmosphere and bosses who do that usually have companies with high level staff turnovers. It creates unrest and staff are all wondering if they are being gossiped about behind closed doors.One of the most efficient companies i worked at, had a weekly team brief. The head of the admin department kept minutes (a log of what was discussed) all departments attended and anyone who wanted to raise an issue at the meeting - communicated with Jonathan.The meeting would last for about an hour, but it was a good use of time because everyone was kept up to date with each department; the right hand always knew what the left hand was doing!Meetings need structure - there needs to be written points and each has to be treat with equal importance - if there's a list of what needs talking about and a person to moderate other people's waffle and ability to digress, then it's about time management and damage control.Because without a list, or a a vague timeline for how long can be spent on each topic, someone will inevitably take the stage and won't get off, there is always one who likes the sound of his/her voice, to the extent that they can hijack meetings, digress away from any sort of conclusion about anything and it wastes everybody else's time.So the key to effective meetings - is effective schedules and time management prompts. Make sure everyone that has something to say, gets their time to be listened to and acknowledged.I've found there is usually one gobshite in every group of people and you know the one; the one who thinks his topic is more important and that gives him some wierd feeling of self entitlement, to interrupt people when they are talking.They are so much easier to manage IF YOU HAVE a list for agendas and topics - that is already in a specific order, because everytime they pipe up, responding with “yes Thanks for that David it is on the agenda and we will discuss it in turn - now back to Jenna, as you were saying Jenna…”It's a slightly longer version to “shut up you ignorant shit; stop queue jumping and belittling someone else who is speaking.”It's really bad manners to talk over people and it's amazing how many people do it without even realising, even in an environment that is supposed to be professional. The weekly meetings we used to have meant that each department had to contribute updates on what they'd been working on, targets and whether they were met and other news.That structure made everyone equally as significant in the script of the meeting.Those are some of the best techniques I've seen for meetings - that weren't too overbearing to be part of.","118,716 followers",Kalpit Veerwal,5.9K,357,22.6M,2019,https://www.quora.com/How-advanced-is-drone-technology-in-a-military-engagement-between-superpowers
