1,"Well, there was a Walmart in Germany, but they basically never understood the German market - neither the grocery market nor the labour market. So they pulled out and cut their losses.Grocery market: The German grocery market is brutal and requires a highly efficient operation because margins are very low. It breaks down into basically three tiers: Discount, regular, luxurious.Well, there was a Walmart in Germany, but they basically never understood the German market - neither the grocery market nor the labour market. So they pulled out and cut their losses.Grocery market: The German grocery market is brutal and requires a highly efficient operation because margins are very low. It breaks down into basically three tiers: Discount, regular, luxurious.Note that the tiers overlap these days. ALDI is currently selling caviar, the real stuff, at 1€ per gram. Still not cheap, but it's good quality, and cheaper than at the DELI…. unless the deli has it on sale…. .Apart from that, you still have the artisanial butchers and bakers, who will be a bit more expensive than hard discount, but offer noticeably better quality. AS was pointed out, you also have the options of weekly markets, where a lot of produce is regionally sourced and typically of very good quality, if not exactly a bargain.Walmart didn't fit in. They tried the discount pricing… but failed to beat ALDI and LIDL at their game. But the discount push delisted the deli stuff, because suppliers said no. This led to reduced choices and drove away customers who had gone there before to pick up the ‘exotic’ stuff… because WALMART no longer offered that. Walmart never attempted the luxury tier.In tbe end, there was no reason to shop at a semi-discount who was almost, but not quite, as cheap as ALDI, but had none of the choice range of EDEKA.Labour market: Walmart didn’t understand german labour relations. Germany still is quite highly unionized, although this varies from region to region and branch to branch. Metallworkers, for example, are still quite highly organised. What’s more important, though, is that trade unions are rooted in the general population. Even if you don’t agree with some (or all) trade unions, most germans (at least those I know, including my free-enterprise loving dad) will say that, overall, it’s probably a good thing to have them around. Unions Are Not The Enemy. Indeed, in the last 20 years, the trade unions have shown fiscal responsibility by showing restraint when it came to wages.Apart from that, there areWalmart, when it came to Germany, had a very bad reputation for ignoring these worker’s rights to begin with, and they didn’t exactly help their perception in german population with the way they communicated. Bottom line, the german population didn’t want another ALDI if it meant treading on worker’s rights, and, on top, ALDI actually has quite a decent reputation as an employer. They did change track quickly, but by then, the damage to their image was already done.Edit: Corrected a few spelling mistakes, updated labour relations section.",26 followers,Balaji Viswanathan,4.5K,5.6K,427.2M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Why-arent-big-organisations-like-Amazon-Microsoft-Google-and-Walmart-not-investing-in-an-emerging-technology-like-Blockchain-Or-are-there-any-projects-the-public-arent-aware-of
2,"Sooooo, you’re asking for random strangers to predict the future. Nobody can do that. It’s not currently within Amazon’s strategy to buy out massive competitors. It bought Whole Foods for strategic reasons just like it bought out movie theaters. But it would be catastrophically stupid (and not likely possible) to buy out Walmart. Amazon already purchased Twitch with the goal of competing with YouTube. Why spend the $800 billion that it doesn’t have buying Alphabet when it can spend a quarter that building native systems to compete with it.","21,773 followers",Glyn Williams,885,9.1K,53.2M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Why-arent-big-organisations-like-Amazon-Microsoft-Google-and-Walmart-not-investing-in-an-emerging-technology-like-Blockchain-Or-are-there-any-projects-the-public-arent-aware-of

Our society isn’t a great one in the education department.If we wanted better education, we could surely have it. It’s commonly known that summer vacation is not good for learning. And yet we have it. Sitting for long periods of time is not ideal for many students. And yet we do it. The structure of elementary schools does terrible things to many boys. And yet we keep it.

Our society isn’t a great one in the education department.If we wanted better education, we could surely have it. It’s commonly known that summer vacation is not good for learning. And yet we have it. Sitting for long periods of time is not ideal for many students. And yet we do it. The structure of elementary schools does terrible things to many boys. And yet we keep it. The structure of middle and high schools does terrible things to many girls. And yet we promote it.Our schools are so riddled with inefficiencies and shortcomings that I could write a thousand answers on the topic. But, I can sum them all up into one basic idea:We don’t care about education.If we did, schools would get amazing equipment and top-notch resources. But today, teachers in my building were told we use too much paper.If we did, academic superstars would have a special day where they were lauded by their fellow classmates. But last week, students in my building were pulled out of class to witness signing day, a day where future athletes are lauded by their fellow classmates.If we did, experimentation would lead to techniques that were recognized and used across the profession. But today, in classrooms across the country, teachers were forced to wing it because they had no idea what to do to help their students after years of failed attempts.If we did, parents would call teachers, curiously inquiring about the well-being of their children, and helping design a way forward for them. But instead, I can’t reach half my parents no matter how hard I try.If we did, states would spend billions of dollars renovating and upgrading facilities. But states spend billions of dollars on new sports stadiums instead.There was a time when almost no one in this country graduated from high school. Then, around 1910, we decided as a nation that education was the future. We put our money where our mouth was and built great schools across the country. And we told students, “This is the future. Your mind is your greatest asset. Let’s build it up.”High school has barely changed in the ensuing 100 years, while the world outside has morphed into a future that the graduating class of 1914 would barely recognize.Now, I know what you’re thinking. “Oh, it’s not that bad. We care about education!”Well, try this little quiz with me.Who is this:OK. Who is this:How about this guy:and now him:Yeah, that’s what I thought. What if I told you that the two you didn’t know were Tu Youyou and Tim Berners-Lee. Feeling any better?Maybe you know who Berners-Lee is (though I’m betting many of you don’t). But Tu Youyou? Yeah, me neither.We don’t care about education. Not in the way we care about music or sports we don’t.What’s wrong with American high schools? I am. And so are you. We don’t care about them. We don’t care enough to vote in politicians who will raise our taxes to pay for them. We don’t care enough to run for school board, or even attend school board meetings. We don’t care enough to call our governors and demand better schools for our students. We don’t donate to schools.We don’t care about education.","105,674 followers",Dave Consiglio,12.1K,6.8K,91.6M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Why-arent-big-organisations-like-Amazon-Microsoft-Google-and-Walmart-not-investing-in-an-emerging-technology-like-Blockchain-Or-are-there-any-projects-the-public-arent-aware-of

Life, fortune and mishaps are unpredictable, nobody knows how long he lives.2. I am your father, and if I don't tell you these, no one else will.3. Whatever written is my own personal bitter experiences that perhaps could save you a lot of unnecessary heartaches.*Remember the following as you go through life.*1. Do not bear grudge towards those who are not good to you. No one has the responsibility of treating you well, except your mother and I.To those who are good to you, you have to treasure it and be thankful, and ALSO you have to be cautious, because, everyone has a motive for every move. When a person is good to you, it does not mean he really will be good to you. You have to be careful, don't hastily regard him as a real friend.2. No one is indispensable, nothing is in the world that you must possess.Once you understand this idea, it would be easier for you to go through life when people around you don't want you anymore, or when you lose what you wanted the most.3. Life is short.When you waste your life today, tomorrow you would find that life is leaving you. The earlier you treasure your life, the better you enjoy life.4. Love is nothing but a transient feeling, and this feeling would fade with time and with one's mood. If your so called loved one leaves you, be patient, time will wash away your aches and sadness.Don't over exaggerate the beauty and sweetness of love, and don't over exaggerate the sadness of falling out of love.5. A lot of successful people did not receive a good education, that does not mean that you can be successful by not studying hard! Whatever knowledge you gain is your weapon in life.One can go from rags to riches, but one has to start from some rags !6. I do not expect you to financially support me when I am old, neither would I financially support your whole life. My responsibility as a supporter ends when you are grown up. After that, you decide whether you want to travel in a public transport or in your limousine, whether rich or poor.7. You honour your words, but don't expect others to be so. You can be good to people, but don't expect people to be good to you. If you don't understand this, you would end up with unnecessary troubles.8. I have bought lotteries for umpteen years , but could never strike any prize. That shows if you want to be rich, you have to work hard! There is no free lunch !9. No matter how much time I have with you, let's treasure the time we have together. We do not know if we would meet again in our next life.Your Parents_X Y Z_*Read it twice**Ask your son and daughter to read it thrice.","4,738 followers",Ben Podgursky,536,337,9.7M,2016,https://www.quora.com/With-emerging-technologies-including-AI-what-are-the-best-academic-areas-for-high-school-graduates-to-consider-for-long-term-career-success

This is why we expect to see it be among the biggest IT trends of 2018. The IoT is usually driven by the industry and will succeed the most if it focuses on getting solutions for some specified problems. The industry focuses on firmware and software that is hardware centric and suits those who love creating solutions and meets the demands of the engineering field.Big dataThe technologies that are related to the big data will continue rising in importance in 2018. Due to its great return on investment, impact speed and measurability, digital marketing are now more popular as compared to the traditional marketing. This means that big data is now applied to the big business as many of the digital marketing campaigns can rely on the huge data quantities to ensure effectiveness and a greater reach. This is why companies are now relying on the data management to ensure conversions from online connections.Mobile web performanceA website that hasn’t been optimized for the mobile devices is now getting penalized by the search engines. Nowadays, more users are expecting a better online performance from mobile devices. This has resulted in a race for the improvement ofArtificial intelligenceAccording to a leadingCloud computingA key IT concept that is commonly talked about is cloud computing. This involves the use of computer services like hardware and software over the internet.There are 3 various benefits of cloud computing. These include:However, there are also certain concerns regarding cloud computing such as compliance, IT governance, privacy, legal abuse and many more.User interfaceThe user interface is one area that has undergone massive revolution since the touch screen was introduced. The capability of the touchscreen has revolutionized how the end users are able to interact with the application. With the touchscreen capability, the way users are able to interact with the application. Users are now able to interact freely with what is being displayed without the need for an intermediate device such as a mouse.Mobile applicationThe mobile application is another trend that has become popular in the recent past. Mobile apps are designed to run on mobile devices such as tablets and smartphones. These can be downloaded from different operating systems such as Blackberry, Apple, Nokia etc. Some of these are available for free while others come at a cost. Any revenue collected is usually between the app developer and distributor.5 Technology Trends That Will Make Or Break Many Careers In 2018Data is everywhere, and growing at an ever-increasing rateWe are creating an unprecedented amount of data as we live our lives. From social media to the digital footprint we leave as we use services like Netflix or Fitbit or connected systems at work. Every second, 900,000 people hit Facebook, 452,000 of us post to Twitter, and 3.5 million of us search for something on Google.Smart thingsIn what now seems like the “olden days”, only computers could connect to the internet. Maybe, if they were very advanced, some phones could to. Today you can buy lightbulbs, refrigerators, cars, watches, kettles, thermostats and many other “smart”, and therefore connected, objects. In industry, machines are increasingly being built to communicate with each other with less need for human input, in order to more efficiently carry out tasks. Collectively this trend is known as “Internet of Things”, because it isn’t just an internet of computers and phones any more!Artificial Intelligence will rule our livesNot literally as in take over the world (yet). But they will certainly have our attention. The field of cognitive computing revolves around machines which are capable of “thinking” in a similar way humans do – particularly when it comes to learning. Of course, being computers they have certain advantages – in other words, teach them to learn, and they will do so at an incredibly fast rate, with a greater degree of accuracy than any human would be capable of. The result is that they will inevitably become more knowledgeable, capable and able to match solutions (data) to problems.Talking to machines is becoming second natureThe way we interact with machines has evolved from operating levers and valves, to control panels, keyboards and touchscreen interfaces. Thanks (again) to the amount of data we have, we are now at a point where voice controlling machines feels natural and is often the most intuitive option we have.Blockchain will transform the way we record and access certain types of dataBlockchain – the distributed, encrypted and public ledger behind virtual currency",0 followers,Lucas Martin,6.4K,65,4.2M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Why-arent-big-organisations-like-Amazon-Microsoft-Google-and-Walmart-not-investing-in-an-emerging-technology-like-Blockchain-Or-are-there-any-projects-the-public-arent-aware-of
