1,"If it is either Chinese and/or Russian in origin, as I did not hear nor read about that possibility yet, but nervously, it would give China and or Russia the ability to stealthily penetrate American airspace and initiate a future conventional and thermonuclear first-strike capability if the unidentified aerial phenomena can be armed with them.",0 followers,Paul Boorman,2.2K,0,0,2021,https://www.quora.com/How-would-the-current-administration-react-if-the-upcoming-June-1-2021-DoD-release-of-UFO-information-inescapably-and-conclusively-identified-Chinese-technology-behind-many-of-the-reports

5,"They have the four greatest advantages today(a) They have the Required Money for Research and Development(b) They have the Brains available to handle advanced Research - most of whom have learnt requisite skills from Foreign Countries and are ready to further the education for millions of chinese.(c) They have a Low Saturation Point since they were barely technology sufficient even 5 years ago.

Because they have a very hungry demand and loads of money and a very intelligent and trained populace.","5,990 followers",Jens Böttiger,566,2.6K,17.6M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Technology-have-taken-a-hike-in-1960-to-2000-where-major-developments-and-advancements-happened-due-to-transistors-How-did-you-keep-up-with-all-the-updating-technology-What-sources-did-you-use-What-are-your
