1,"In a crash, a car that doesn’t break would be disastrous for its occupants. Modern cars are designed to crumple and pieces are designed to come off in order to lose energy in an impact. Thus the car absorbs the impact of the accident, not the occupant.Here’s an example… this is in NZ and we drive on the left side of the road.This car crossed the road and hit MY truck, parked outside my home, at (I’m guessing) around 140kph (90mph). He shunted my truck 13m up the road into a light pole, and came to rest 30m from the impact zone. Yet amazingly he got out and walked away from this accident.

The entire front of the car was gone (pushed down under the car), yet the driver’s door still opened and closed, and the cockpit area was (at least as far as I could see) fully intact (i.e. no intrusion of motor parts into the driver’s area). If the car had been unbreakable, then his body would look like this instead of the car.",4 followers,John Twigg,9.5K,0,0,2021,https://www.quora.com/In-Call-of-Duty-Advanced-Warfare-how-did-North-Korea-get-such-advanced-technologies

In the mid 60’s I worked for a Lincoln dealership. I still remembered every Wednesdays we have factory bulletins issued to us which we suppose to file and keep up to date. Fast forward to the late 90’s , printed repair manuals are no longer available and you have to get a subscription service - Mitchell 1 to download service information at close to $2000 a year to keep up with repair procedures, recalls and factory bulletins. Repairs are divided into engines, transmission, OBD II engine computer control diagnostic, system wiring diagrams, electronic component locator, AC and heating systems, brake systems and anti-lock, collision repairs, hybrid and EV drive systems, etc….. Nowadays, if you are out of the loop for 5 years, you are obsolete! A Tesla EV is basically a computer on wheels. Their parts are not made by the aftermarket and their drivetrain information is proprietary. They don’t want you to work on their cars because you can do more damage to the vehicle and at worst, electrocute yourself! That is why Tesla fought against laws that required dissemination of repair information by manufacturers - “The right to repair law”. To satisfy the requirement of that law, they released the repair information very slowly.Our expectancy from our cars have changed over the years. My dad worked for Henry Ford in the late 20’s. Those cars didn’t require a tool investment like the present. It is not unusual to see a tech investing many thousands of dollars for tools of their trade. Some of the specialized tools only service one or two model years! GM computer carburetors repair set, Cadillac water pump wrench that only work on their Northstar engines, Ford variable venturi carburetors to mechanical/electronic fuel injections of the Bosch D, K, KE jetronics etc. required a sizeable of investments of tools and knowledge. Nowadays, electronic tools are a must. Dual trace/4 trace oscilloscopes, OBD readers with access to CAN network and ABS are new requirement for the modern technician. Training is also high on the agenda as well as many factory or after market suppliers sponsors seminars that you have to pay to enroll and certify.The complexity is driven by governmental regulations, EPA, NHTSA, ecological and climate change realities, fuel quality and chemistry, MPG and operating cost made possible by the evolution of faster and more powerful computer processors that control dedicated electronic networks designed to milk every ounce of energy from the fuel. Direction injection, start/stop technology, cylinder deactivation 5 to 10 speed automatic transmission or cvt transmission. Every new vehicle sold these day must have 4 wheel anti-lock brake system, power or the newer electric steering, power or electric braking system, AC and heating system, rear view camera, blind spot warning system, collision avoidance sensors and actuators, air bags/side curtains/seat belts.

4,"Even today with automation and computers, we are still doing things like switching screens for things like displays.Let's look at Uhura's station.

There he can monitor the flight and make minor adjustments without going to the cockpit, but when they're approaching Alderaan, the ship's computer alerts him so he can drop the ship back to sublight.",738 followers,Scottie Odom,1.5K,1.3K,5.8M,2021,https://www.quora.com/In-Call-of-Duty-Advanced-Warfare-how-did-North-Korea-get-such-advanced-technologies

6,"You have to realize that the original Star Trek series came out well before the personal computer. Computers were big, and not that fast.

But they might be consoles with some buttons, screens with press able options, similar to what they use on Star Trek.

7,"Why do you assume that would ever be the case?There are no examples to be found in history where advancement just stops. It has slowed down at times, but even then it wasn't that technology stopped so much as it wasn't being widely shared.

There are examples of stagnant civilizations in Star Trek that have apparently stalled at a certain level and remained there for huge stretches of time, people like the Talosians and the Vidiaans.TalosianVidiianAnd a lot more races who did the more believable thing of collapsing into a primitive pre-civilization and needing to start over.
