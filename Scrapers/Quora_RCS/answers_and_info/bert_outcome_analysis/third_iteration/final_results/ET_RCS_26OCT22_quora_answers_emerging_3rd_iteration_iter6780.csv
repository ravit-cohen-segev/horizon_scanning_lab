1,"I think it will be quite difficult in the near to medium term. Opposition to China, or even anti-China, is probably the only attitude that has bi-partisan support in US politics. This will not change regardless of who wins the elections in November. The negative attitude appears quite pervasive among intellectuals and elites, and even the general public across the country.This kind of US antagonism is not new. In the 1980’s it wrath was directed at Japan, then making good economic progress and was perceived to pose a challenge to US economic supremacy.

The negative attitude appears quite pervasive among intellectuals and elites, and even the general public across the country.This kind of US antagonism is not new. In the 1980’s it wrath was directed at Japan, then making good economic progress and was perceived to pose a challenge to US economic supremacy. Shintaro Ishihara in his book, “The Japan That Can Say No” mentioned that the mood in the US during his visit in April 1987 was “venomously hostile”, Americans were “increasingly emotional, almost hysterical, about Japan”. Congress had imposed sanctions on Japanese semiconductor makers. “The kind of trade friction that exists between Japan and the US would not occur if a West Germany, Britain, or Australia had achieved our (Japanese) economic power and standing.”US Navy had placed a powerful sonar unit on the bows of civilian tankers & container ships to detect nuclear submarines (Russian’s). US refused the offer by Japan of its merchant vessels. He noted, “Americans feel that they cannot trust Japan. We cannot decode the sonar signals, but still they choose not to ask us to collect the data. US admirals would probably even ask the Russians before they asked the Japanese.”Ishihara opined that the reason is “American racism stems from pride in cultural superiority”. We are actually quite familiar with this. That pundits and commentators made derogatory remarks about the Asian people are common. Many in the US & UK who shape opinions, have viewed the Chinese people to be lower than Asians, “the sick man of Asia”.The challenge from Japan was brought to a close by tariffs and mostly by the Plaza Accord signed in September 1985 by US, UK, France, Germany, and Japan. Japan was effectively forced to revalue the Yen. It had cost the country 2 decades of growth, and which it has yet to shake off. Japan was too small to fight the US and depended on the US for its defence.China’s situation is different. It is stronger, has a much larger population, and has no need for US defence. US situation is also different. Although it is still the most powerful country in the world, it is not so dominant. I think even its allies will not go “Yes Sir, No Sir” when ordered or told. The world is now much more diversified and well informed, so countries will need to be convinced. China will have to act with circumspection if it wants to carry the votes. US too, in view of the dilution of its power. Already President Trump has already expended much goodwill.What does China want? Indications are that in the military area, it has no ambition and is perhaps incapable of, challenging the superpower status of US or Russia. It has a bold red line on Taiwan, and a faint one on SCS, which it is working out with ASEAN. Its economic objectives are (1) to raise its prowess in technologies, of which MIC 2025 is the most visible, (2) to extend its international relationship and connections, hence, its leadership of the BRI project, and (3) to have its voice heard in international organisations like IMF and WTO in consonance with its economic heft in the world. Xi Jinping’s ambition is to make China into a middle income society.Is the US willing to accommodate it? It is not clear what US wants. It sees China as strategic competitor, although in some context, it has been described as enemy. Indications are that it is (1) singularly focused on power and the exercise of power, including the power of the media, to counter China in every way, although the objectives are often unclear to outsiders, and (2) to frustrate China’s advance in selected technologies, like 5G, AI, and autonomous vehicles. It has of course the right to impose whatever restrictions it deem necessary, just as China has the right to proceed with its development plan.Put in this way, it would appear that the differences are not that unbridgeable. The problem is each side fails or is unwilling to recognize the red line of the other. We of the rest of the world can only hope that at some point in time wisdom will prevail.Has Covid-19 any long-term effect on their relationship? Near term, the effect is negative. US continues as varying degree of stringency to make claims and charges against China, disregarding science. China pushes back strongly, often in innuendo. The climate is quite toxic. But it could improve longer-term. Huge sums of money have been injected into the economies worldwide. Some countries have surplus, most are in deficit. How to cooperate for common benefit? There are very many rational questions like these. If they are forcefully posed, they will fruitfully lead the governments to redirect the focus away from seeking blame or scoring points to that of people’s welfare and the economy. As mentioned above, we hope wisdom will prevail.","84,365 followers",Paul Denlinger,1.1K,11.5K,55.1M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Does-the-evolving-technology-dynamic-between-China-and-the-West-involve-a-mix-of-envy

3,"Usually when you “hate” a country, you are hating its government, because the people of a country is a vast and complex conception, and is truly hard to be precisely targeted.So let’s assume you hate “Chinese government”, it would probably because it has or does something that you don’t agree with. If you are a common citizen living in a Western country, there are simply too many things you can see or hear from your main stream media about China, and all of them are against your values or interests. I won’t give any example here, but anyone seeing this answer would be familiar with those thingUsually when you “hate” a country, you are hating its government, because the people of a country is a vast and complex conception, and is truly hard to be precisely targeted.So let’s assume you hate “Chinese government”, it would probably because it has or does something that you don’t agree with.

I won’t give any example here, but anyone seeing this answer would be familiar with those things, no matter if they are true or just stereotype.The reason you are jealous of China, however, would most likely because the last 4 decades has witnessed the fast development of China, which has lifted the living and working conditions of its citizens from a very poor, backward level to a middle-developed level. Considering the overall population of China, 1.4 billion, this achievement is undoubtedly a modern miracle of human conditions on earth. Moreover, despite the annual howl of “China collapse” from some Westerners, China has kept stepping forward steadily with its own pace and self-confidence, leaving the world an improving image of “a responsible great power”. All this is making a lot of foreigners jealous and angry.You hate something when it is out of your control or understanding. You are jealous of something because when you believe it should have met its doom long ago, it grows and prospers.Maybe it’s time for you to think really hard about one question: How did China get today’s accomplishments if all she did was wrong?",52 followers,David Levy,889,295,1.9M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Does-the-evolving-technology-dynamic-between-China-and-the-West-involve-a-mix-of-envy
4,"Within ten years. I went on a visit to China last year. Most of what we are fed in the press about China in the UK is negative: human rights, Tienanmen Square, blocked Google, smog, Hong Kong democracy, dictatorship etc.I arrived in Kunming, Yunnan expecting to find the sense of oppression I had experienced in eastern Europe in the late 1970s and to be struggling with pollution etc.I walked around with my mouth open! No pollution, clean streets, no beggars/homeless, wide variety of independent shops and food outlets, moderate traffic, !!electric motorcycles!!, well run places to stay, deliciouWithin ten years.

No pollution, clean streets, no beggars/homeless, wide variety of independent shops and food outlets, moderate traffic, !!electric motorcycles!!, well run places to stay, delicious food (so much better than UK ‘Chinese takeaway), very little sexualisation of women (either clothes or depiction in adverts), everyone with a 15cm smartphone, great internet access, people hiring bikes with an app on their phone.Where shall I stop?Once the truth starts to filter to the general population, respect will grow.Of course there will be resistance. We in the West cannot bear the idea that our version of ‘democracy’ is not the best for everyone. It will take us a while to understand the role of the Chinese Communist party and the benefits of a system like that.Addition 1: We are told that China suppresses religion - but in Dali there is a three-sources temple in the town - Confucius, Tao, Buddha - and the Confucius Centre in the centre has been completely rebuilt in the last few years. On the outskirts there is the Guan Yin temple. Ordinary folk out shopping come in all the time to say a prayer etc. I sensed their genuinely spiritual experience.Addition 2: I also realised why China was advancing so fast - they work steadily! Wherever I looked people seemed to be just ‘getting on with it’. I sensed this was a deep habit, centuries old in the population.Addition 3: Dancing in the park! Amazing. Just a group of people with a music-system doing musical Tai Chi. Another small group playing instruments in the park. So unselfconscious. Just enjoying themselves.Update 2020: My prediction is probably now wrong. A dark cloud has descended over China/West relations. There is a growing China-phobia in the UK. People with no knowledge of China, who, when I wrote this post 2 years ago, would have little to say about China, now are experts making cold-war-like statements.I responded recently to a very good article by a Harvard professor warning against a new cold-war with China. I was immediately vilified by comment writers (as was the author), accusing me of being a Chinese troll, or perhaps the author of the article. Very disturbing.The main driving force for this is that western commentators blame China for their COVID19 deaths because of the delay in reporting in Dec 2019. The very slow and inadequate responses by the UK, US and now Brazil and all the consequent deaths are blamed in China, not on the inadequate response.China is not perfect, but the inaccurate picture I reported 2 years ago has been transformed into something more dangerous.",157 followers,Jamie Wang,1.5K,998,12.4M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Does-the-evolving-technology-dynamic-between-China-and-the-West-involve-a-mix-of-envy
5,"You’re reading this wrong. The West recognizes China’s ascension and is concerned about losing its global hegemony. That’s all.We all know that the West could not stay on top forever.

6,"I think it’s a great article. Well-reasoned and well-articulated.I think it presents an accurate and thorough picture of modern China.China is the oldest continuous civilization state in human history going back nearly 5,000 years. It has learned a lot about how to survive and persist. Its lessons carry over to the present day.China feels no need to hew to Western thinking. Indeed, it sees Western thinking as fundamentally flawed.As long as the West does not understand China, its culture and history, it will always have bad policy towards China.",18 followers,Asim Qureshi,12.7K,996,156.1M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Does-the-evolving-technology-dynamic-between-China-and-the-West-involve-a-mix-of-envy
