0,"Because China was Centralized. Europe was Decentralized. To give you an example, the Ming Emperor ended sea travels and that was that. Columbus wanted to sail to Asia but was rejected by the Italian Government. So what did he do? He went to the Spanish one and they were happy to do it for him to go around the Ottoman Empire controling the trade routes to Europe. IF the spaniards denied him, he could’ve also went to the Dutch and the english! Unfortunately for Chinese explorers, they only had the Ming Dynasty to go to.","33,161 followers",Susanna Viljanen,903,10.7K,164.9M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Given-that-China-produced-such-revolutionary-technological-advances-such-as-gunpowder-paper-the-compass-and-printing-why-didn-t-China-build-a-world-spanning-empire-the-way-that-the-Europeans-did
1,"Because China is nation, a country. Europe is a continent with many nations always at war. China doesn’t want war and isn’t bloodthirsty. Europeans, on the other hand, always want blood and death of their neighbors.","2,317 followers",Pablo Djankowicz Ruizinowitz,3.2K,2K,7.7M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Given-that-China-produced-such-revolutionary-technological-advances-such-as-gunpowder-paper-the-compass-and-printing-why-didn-t-China-build-a-world-spanning-empire-the-way-that-the-Europeans-did
2,"Why did the Chinese discover gunpowder before Europeans?China discovered gunpowder and one reason that Europe didn’t is that there are few natural sources of the essential component of saltpeter in Europe. China took centuries to make something that went flash into something that went bang.

[1]When did European firearms become superior to Chinese ones?If we look at firearms, European firearms are superior to Chinese ones by about 1500. [2]Why did European firearms become superior to Chinese ones?The Europeans worked harder at making better firearms (in terms of personal weapons rather than artillery) because they were a solution to a problem they had. Dealing with armoured knights and massed infantry.For artillery, they had all those lovely castle to knock down. The French kicked the English out of France by destroying their castles with cannon in the Hundred Years War.The Chinese, by contrast, were menaced by steppe cavalry who were highly mobile. Early small arms fired too slowly and had too short a range to be effective against horse archers, and a mass of infantry firepower, though sufficient too drive off horse archers would not be much use as the horse archers could just go and attack somewhere else around the corner. Similarly artillery was insufficiently mobile to threaten an enemy such as the Mongols. [3]. Dr Chase argues that countries like Japan also developed powerful firearms because they didn’t face the Mongol threat (or one of similar nomads),I am sure that this is only part of the answer.Footnotes",286 followers,Michael Pothoven,3.6K,179,1.9M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Given-that-China-produced-such-revolutionary-technological-advances-such-as-gunpowder-paper-the-compass-and-printing-why-didn-t-China-build-a-world-spanning-empire-the-way-that-the-Europeans-did
3,"China created great technology, rocket, printing press, paper, compass, gunpowder. How did it fall behind the West?You are over-thinking this. These ancient inventions are not things like, say, electricity. Once you figure out how to generate electricity in a meaningful way, you can immediately start inventing a whole bunch of things using electric power, like light bulbs, engines, radios, etc. It’s like grabbing on to the stem of a bunch of grapes, and just pulling the whole bunch off the vine.The ancient inventions are not like that.

Once you figure out how to generate electricity in a meaningful way, you can immediately start inventing a whole bunch of things using electric power, like light bulbs, engines, radios, etc. It’s like grabbing on to the stem of a bunch of grapes, and just pulling the whole bunch off the vine.The ancient inventions are not like that. There wasn’t any theoretical foundation upon which one can build in a purposeful fashion, and putting together new structures of inventions the way you put Lego bricks together. Putting Lego bricks together is the way we invent things now. These ancient inventions are more like “I was just walking around, and stubbed my toe on a giant piece of diamond” - sort of thing. You have that if you’ve lived for a long time, and China does have a continuous history of 5,000 years where the good stuff wasn’t lost, the way it happened with the ancient Roman and Egyptian civilizations.For example, compass was invented around 200 BC. It wasn’t invented for navigation or anything. It was invented by some Taoist monks who were in the business of swindling the emperor for money, by claiming they could tell fortune. So they threw these pointy magnets around and said, look, these magic stones all point to North, and that’s a very good sign. It means you’ll get lucky. Of course the magnets would always point to the North, ‘cause, do you want to be the one who tells the emperor his luck has run out? No? Well then. Well it was a good trick while it lasted, but it was only good for so long, and sooner or later people realized that the darn thing always pointed to the North. Voila! Compass!Paper was invented in China around 100 BC. Because before that time, the Chinese wrote articles on bamboo stripes like these:So - it’s like five paragraphs per roll of bamboo strip book. As you can see, even a short novel, written on these bamboo strips, is going to be as heavy as a tree. So every time you have some report to show your boss, you’ll have to basically lug a tree to your boss’s office. Eventually, one of the court officials got tired of lugging trees around, and decided to wipe boiled barks and wood chips over fish net, and dry it under the sun. Thus the paper was invented. It was an instant hit. Who in the world wants to lug trees around all day?As for gunpowder, no, it wasn’t invented for war. By the ninth century, China was getting fairly wealthy. Most people ate well and dressed well, so then, what more do you want? Live longer! Hopefully forever! It’s funny that in the West, people tried alchemy for gold, and in the East, people tried alchemy for immortality. But basically, that was what the alchemists in China worked on. So these guys, usually self-proclaimed Taoist monks, started putting various elements they could find in nature into the oven, and baked them together for a long time, to see what would come out. There was absolutely no scientific reason to think that a magic immortality pill would come out of the oven. It was basically another swindle to get money out of the emperor. And some unlucky bastards always had their ovens blown up! The ovens got blown up so many times that eventually people figured out that when you put sulfur, charcoal, and potassium nitrate together, the oven would always blow up. Thus gunpowder was invented. In the mean time, the alchemists did find something that would make their emperor feel good and energized - it’s some mixture of low-level arsenic and mercury, sold to the emperor as the immortality pill. How long do I have to take this? Oh, once a day, just keep taking it. These alchemists probably popped off more Chinese emperors than wars ever did in China.So this kind of “I was just walking around and stubbed my toe on a giant piece of diamond”-kind of invention is simply not competitive with modern science-guided inventions. One is mostly luck and practical need, the other is a whole scientific methodology. The emergence of some dudes named Newton and Descartes was the kind of luck China didn’t have, so falling behind was the only logical outcome, unless China had sent an embassy at that time to Europe to learn. So you see the army of Chinese students in American and European schools nowadays? You see, they’ve learned.PS: A mere 500 years ago, if you know 4th-grade trigonometry, you’d be ranked as genius. If you shift the time frame, you can also ask why the great Carolingian Empire couldn’t do 4th-grade trigonometry - because what we take for granted today were really strokes of genius if you had started from nothing!

4,"No.Technology hasAs you see,No.Technology hasAs you see,Gunpowder was for a long time more or less restricted only on siege and naval warfare. It became decisive only by introduction of bayonet in the 18th century - now the pike and shot could be combined into one single type of troops - and a real gamebreaker only by the introduction of Minié musket and rifling in the mid-19th century.Rifling is an European medieval invention; it was invented in Germany in the 1490s, but adopted on battlefield only in the mid-19th century.Sunzi is no prophet in his own hometown. While the Chinese areWhat the Chinese would have needed would not have been new technology, but pure military mind - professional, organized military mind, genius in logistics, strategy and tactics, separate from court politics and plotting.","2,537 followers",Carter Alston,11.8K,149,1.5M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Given-that-China-produced-such-revolutionary-technological-advances-such-as-gunpowder-paper-the-compass-and-printing-why-didn-t-China-build-a-world-spanning-empire-the-way-that-the-Europeans-did
