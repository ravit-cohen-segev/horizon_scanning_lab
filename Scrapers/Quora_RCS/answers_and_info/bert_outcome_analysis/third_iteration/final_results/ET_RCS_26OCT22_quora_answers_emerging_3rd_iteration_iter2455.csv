India has to import all TBMs, we don't have any capacity to build one.They also have this monster:It is used to build railway tracks. It can do the job, much faster and perfectly.In manufacturing, research and development, and technology India doesn't even stand a chance against China. Comparing the two is preposterous. The pathetic state of Indian manufacturing can be gauged from the fact that 69 years after independence, India can't even manufacture products as simple as earphones. Yes, even your earphones are probably manufactured in China, though they might contain a Made in India tag, to fool the Indians.Comparing the two countries would be a great injustice to China. Most of Chinese people don't want their country to be compared with India, they think of it below their dignity, the same way we think of Pakistan. They like to compare their country with countries like America and Japan.Images source:","5,084 followers",Bobby Tatro,3.2K,2.2K,45.6M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Will-advancing-technology-slow-down-or-advanced-more-and-more

If too many people decided to reproduce at the same time, everyone could die from starvation! The entire pack!In that light, homosexuality was quite useful: if a minor percentage of the pack didn’t breed, it greatly relieved it from pressure. Homosexuals could then spend their time helping taking care for their siblings (with whom they share approximately 50% of the genes, same amount as they would’ve with their children) or children of siblings (with whom they share circa 25% of the genes).As the result, their effort was 25% efficient — as opposed to the alternative of 0% (remember — if the pack bred too much, everyone dies).Next,If you are into reading about sex of fruitflies —Q:Exactly!Which is why homosexuality is aFor a trait to disappear completely, it must be absolutely devastating in every way — because if there is a loophole to turn a disadvantageous trait into an advantage, some individuals will exploit it.Here’s a real example:Those are moths calledHowever, after the Industrial Revolution, many lichens disappeared, and tree bark was darkened by soot. Immediately, black colouration became advantageous, and in a matter of decades, black moths thrived and bred, while lighter ones were eaten out by predators:The new advantage brought by the Industrial Revolution allowed those two blacks out of a hundred whites to become more successful.But one thing doesn’t make sense:I mean, you can understand why those two blacks have taken the population overAnd yet, somehow…You might be seriously underestimating the hardship of drivingHomosexual genes might make reproduction more difficult. But apparently, not difficult enough to stop at least some individuals from passing their genes on. So their existence is not so surprising.Remember:But let’s imagine the worst. Let’s imagine that homosexual genes don’t give any advantages to opposite sex. Let’s imagine that no human could use help from their gay sibling. Let’s even imagine that none of gay people ever get raped by opposite sex or ever try mating with opposite sex even once out of curiosity or because of circumstances.Even thenBecause there’s such a thing asYou see, the status of being sexually reproducing creatures obliges us to carry not one, butSometimes, genes get broken: for example, the gene that makes the embryonic brain sensitive to testosterone (and thus enables the development of sexual attraction to women in men) might mutate and stop doing its job. In that case, the second copy of that gene might back it up, and homosexuality won’t develop.YesAnd again, here’s a real example:It’s a disease that impairs the blood’s ability to coagulate, so any scratch or bruise becomes a potential death sentence to the affected human. It’s a genetic disease that passes on from generation to generation. And it exists even nowadays.But you may wonder:It should’ve. But the thing is:To become sick, you need(if you’re interested —Basically, if some eugenicist bigot decided to exterminate homosexuality, not only would he/she have to exterminate all homosexuals, but also a good deal of heterosexuals who just happen to carry a suppressed copy of homosexuality gene — and I don’t mean bisexuals or something, but indeed a part of perfectly heterosexual population. Because otherwise, even with all homosexuals gone, they’ll inevitably pop up in the next generation.FinallyBottom line isBy the way, did I mention that it’s notUpdateThanks toThere are other, proper examples though: black panthers as the minority of jaguars, and black squirrels as the minority of ordinary squirrels (thanks to","44,117 followers",Josh Fechter,17.6K,591,17.7M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Will-advancing-technology-slow-down-or-advanced-more-and-more

You can’t invent computing without electricity. You can’t have gunpowder without strictly controlling fire (ignition at will). All technology is built on a platform of previous technology.We probably developed modern brains on a wide scale between 60 and 100 thousand years ago. For quite a while after that, we were still just spending time surviving. Language is evolving, we’re doing the hunter gatherer thing. Our days were mostly consumed with subsistence and learning how to express abstraction. There was no such thing as abstraction before we came along. We had to invent how to talk about the future, plan, and communicate with other tribes without killing each other. There were lots of things to work out with this new hardware upstairs.Finally, we learned how to control plants on a wide scale, i.e. agriculture begins. That was about 10,000 years ago. At this point, we have an abundance of food and we don’t have to chase animals around the land all year. So, we’ve really only had 10,000 years to develop anything resembling technology. Before we had an abundance of calories, we were too busy surviving and figuring out what to Do with a brain like this before that.If you think what has happened in 10,000 years, it is almost mind blowing. Everything in history, everything that has ever been invented, written, or built was effectively done in the last 10,000 years. Wow, incredible!Last thing, it was really industrialization that led to the acceleration of technological development. You have to have machines to build new machines. “Machine shops”, where they build parts for other machines, took off. From the early part of last century on, we built a ridiculous number of machines and figured out how to use electricity as a power source. Remember, that’s only about 100 years ago. Another wow. So, in 100 years, we went from a light bulb to a computer doing billions of calculations a second (that’s on almost everybody’s desk top). We built a huge machine, stuck a few computers, and some bottled up fire in it, and flew some humans to our moon. In about 100 years. Again, mind blowing.I’m almost scared what is going to happen in the 100 years, let alone 1000. We’re almost too smart for our own good. Hopefully, smart enough not to extinguish ourselves.","5,990 followers",Jens Böttiger,566,2.6K,17.6M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Will-advancing-technology-slow-down-or-advanced-more-and-more
