Afterward, it was replaced by the CD player, then by the iPod, and now by smartphones. There were lots of issues with the Walkman. It was difficult to navigate it to listen to specific songs on a cassette tape. Walkman is also known for chewing up and ruining cassette tapes. Despite these issues, some individuals still use them because of nostalgia.3.When most companies are deciding whether to upgrade their computers to the latest version of Microsoft Windows, they don’t have to consider life-and-death consequences. An exception to that is the U.S. Department of Defense which must take into account both cybersecurity risks and potentially fatal consequences related to computer failures when making the choice to abandon legacy operating systems such as Windows XP.The military’s old-established relationship with Windows XP is not unusual. Lots of PC users and organizations clung to Windows XP long after its 2001 debut and refused to upgrade to follow-up Windows versions. In 2014, when Microsoft officially ended support for the aging operating system, Windows XP still accounted for 30% of operating systems around the world. At the time, officials estimated that 3% of the Pentagon’s several million PCs were still running Windows XP. In 2014 a Navy official issued a directive titled “Windows XP Eradication Efforts.” However, the mission-critical functions of some of those PCs can defy straightforward upgrades—which is why the Pentagon has often found it easier to occasionally give Microsoft multimillion-dollar contract for supporting specialized systems running on Windows XP, Windows 2003, and other legacy Microsoft solutions.",21 followers,Timothy Singleton,4.1K,3.1K,3.9M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-top-Spanish-technology-startup-blogs-similar-to-TechCrunch-GigaOM-and-Mashable

I am going to give the perspective of a 52-year-old who has seen a great deal of change, some of it for the better, most of it for the worse. I am going to share what has led to my misanthropic nihilism and negativity concerning the current “state of affairs.”Even with our greater technology, I-Phones, computers, medical advances, and other luxuries, these problems lessen us every day, and not enough people care to do a damn thing about it. Obsessive greed is one of the things we most need to tackle, from big corporations to medicine and higher education. Money is important but we have allowed that obsession to get in the way of the higher interest of caring for all our citizens. Making all their needs more affordable and obtainable is a good start. I am thankful I do not have kids. I would grieve incessantly now to think of the world I have brought them into. I only hope that younger people are observing this disaster and that they will take the reigns and make some needed changes. It may be too late.* To the few folks (including a lady who was so rude I deleted her comment) who think we should love the country as it is or “get out,” I say this. Such reactions are naive and juvenile. I love my country and I wish to see it become better. Civilizations do not progress through complacency. They advance when folks sound alarms and encourage change. That is why women and minority groups now have rights they would never have enjoyed had they just “loved it or got out.”",UNKNOWN,Shaun,13.8K,1.2K,881.4K,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-top-three-outdated-technologies-still-used-in-the-United-States

This is grossly inferior to the Tomahawk, but with half a ton of high explosives carried onboard, it’s actually sufficient to do the job it was supposed to do.Russians also use a number of older models, from Soviet years. However they can usually hit the building they were aiming for and their warheads are large enough to do the damage they were supposed to do. That means it’s hard to say they’re outdated. I would agree they are not as modern as what the West, especially the USA is fielding, but they do the job most of the time.The key deficiency in Russian arms is not how obsolescent their technology is. It is a drawback in some cases, but overall their technology is still good enough for modern warfare. It’s all the other stuff that’s actually more important that is lacking. For missiles that would be surveillence and intelligence data - Russians are hitting Ukrainian power plants and other civilian infrastructure, because they don’t know where Ukrainian military targets are. That is an absolutely massive deficiency, the accuracy and performance of their missiles isn’t even a speck in the rear-view mirror in comparison.",0 followers,Jon Mixon,831,33.8K,427.2M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-top-three-outdated-technologies-still-used-in-the-United-States
