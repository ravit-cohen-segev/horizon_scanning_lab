1,"Yes, they already are.In my home town Gothenburg in Sweden, which is also the home town of Volvo, I have frequently met self driving test cars on public roads. They still have a driver for observation and surveillance, but the cars are 100% self driving through dense rush hour city traffic in snow and rain.Tesla has had an option for autonomous cars for several years.My own, much more humble Volvo, is perfectly capable of holding its speed based on the vehicles around me, keep itself in the selected lane, autobrake and even automatically take evasive actions if needed, without me touching theYes, they already are.In my home town Gothenburg in Sweden, which is also the home town of Volvo, I have frequently met self driving test cars on public roads.

Of course it will disengage with a dismayed red icon in the dashboard and a sound signal as soon as I release the steering wheel for more than a few seconds. It is not a self-driving car after all, but still, surprisingly close.The problems with self-driving cars are not primarily technical, but legal.Like, who is resonsible for a crash in a completely self-driving car that maybe doesn’t even have a steering wheel, like the concept in the illustrations below? The owner? The passenger? The manufacturer? And if you get out of the car asking it to park itself and then it bumps into another vehicle? Whose insurance will take the cost? It is all pretty unclear.However, as soon as we have the legal system worked out, I am quite sure that we will see more and more automatic vehicles on our roads, until in maybe 50 years, manually driven cars will no longer exist as they will be regarded as too dangerous.I have to say, while the concept images below are intriguing, I think we need to see a generation shift for the passengers to be able to relax, read and sleep and not hold on to dear life, looking for the brake pedal on floor as the car automatically plunges through a black Swedish forest at 120 kmh in the middle of the night.

7,"The U.S. does contract with commercial aviation companies for transportation both in peacetime and wartime under multiple programs. Some of those that are more specialized (e.g., charters and freight vs scheduled passenger service) will continue to operate 747s as needed to meet their contracts. In particular, a significant number of 747 Freighters will continue in use as they remain economically viable.

Some of those that are more specialized (e.g., charters and freight vs scheduled passenger service) will continue to operate 747s as needed to meet their contracts. In particular, a significant number of 747 Freighters will continue in use as they remain economically viable. Atlas Air is the largest 747 operator (both for freight and charter flights) and is still taking deliveries of 747–8Fs (which will end this year). UPS is the second largest 747 operator and just took delivery of their last 747–8F. So while 747s are leaving scheduled passenger service, they are far from disappearing from active use.Many of the passenger jets being retired will go into long term storage for the “just in case” scenario where their use in air travel once again makes sense. Eventually they will be parted out (i.e., turned into spare parts) or destroyed and their materials recycled. The 777–9 offers comparable range and passenger load at substantially better economics than the 747–400, so the 747 is unlikely to return (unless the 777–9 is cancelled, which is not an impossibility) even if strong demand for large long-haul aircraft returns. Obviously from the standpoint of your question, as 777–9s proliferate those owned by US carriers would be available to provide surge capability to the military.Even without the 777–9 there are a vast number of large long-haul widebody jets in the U.S. civil fleet. The 777–300 was intended to replace the earlier (pre -400) 747s, and has successfully done so. Other 777 models, 787s, and 767s can all be used to augment US military airlift. The offerings are even more diverse on the freighter front, with even a large number of MD-11 freighters in the fleet and still a few DC-10s in use. So the fact that you no longer hop on a 747 at JFK or LAX for your vacation or business trip to wherever has little impact on US military transport surge capacity.","527,820 followers",Adam,2K,1.1K,5.6M,2022,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-risks-in-emerging-technologies-like-driverless-cars-drones-and-IoT

Even if they aren’t quite 747’s, a lot of them are pretty big.I’d guess that allies that could have to fight an expeditionary war have similar arrangements.(This over and above the USAF’s own considerable airlift capability, which can be used for troops as well as materiel.).I’d imagine that a lot of the retired 747s were also pretty long in the tooth, and the ones most in need of a big intrusive periodic maintenance check were parked first.
