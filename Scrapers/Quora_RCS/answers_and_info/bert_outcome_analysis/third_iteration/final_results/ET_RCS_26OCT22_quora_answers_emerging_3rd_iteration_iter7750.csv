Practical fusion will always be 50+ years ago (not 50 years away). Historically, this early method of producing more energy from nuclear fusion than it took to bring the fusion device to fusion conditions actually worked the very first time it was tried - fission-fusion technology actually never failed to work. Today, pure fusion device technology derived from successful early fission-fusion designs that does not require a fission primary is possible and is a better candidate for peaceful, ultra-clean, commercial electrical energy production from fusion.Inertial Confinement Fusion of Hybrid DT-DD Pure Fusion Devices for Energy Production -Deuterium is a very cheap and abundant fusion fuel. The deuterium in sea water is capable of completely powering planet earth at a the current level of 17 Terawatts for 29.4 billion years. Deuterium-Tritium fusion fuel is however much easier to ignite and requires a less powerful and costly fusion driver to initiate. It makes some sense to minimize the size and cost of an ICF fusion driver (laser or particle accelerator) by using some DT fuel as the first stage fusion primary (the match) while producing the majority of fusion power from ubiquitous sustainable D-D fusion of pure Deuterium.The energy needed to ignite an inertially confined thermonuclear fusion reaction in liquid (or solid) deuterium-tritium (DT) is not that large; it is on the order of not more than 20 MJ or about the same amount of chemical energy stored in about 2.5 cups of automotive gasoline.The problem is that this energy must be compressed in space (focused down to an area less than a 2 mm) and in time (to less than 3 nanoseconds).Conceptual Drawing of a 2-stage DT-DD clean energy optimized pure fusion device.How efficient would a mini-PACER power plant be?Inertial Confinement fusion experiments produce their energy is a repeated succession of short energetic fusion bursts. A two stage DT-DD device has a significant advantage over a single stage ICF fusion target in energy gain.At a power plant level, the fairest and best way to express the efficiency of a fusion power plant is in terms of “wall plug efficiency”. How much (electrical) power do you have to draw from the local power mains to produce a given amount of fusion generated electricity?Modern semi-conductor lasers are between 10% to 30% efficient at converting local electrical power into ultra-violet or X-ray laser light (lets say 10% efficient for the purpose of this calculation). To deliver 20 MJ of light energy to the DT primary fusion capsule would require drawing about 200 MJ of electrical energy from the local power grid. Realistically, there are some additional inefficiencies in delivering ultra-violet or X-ray laser light to the fusion capsule -So the best estimate for the amount of electrical energy that has to be drawn from the local power grid to deliver 20 MJ of ultra-violet or X-ray energy to the fusion capsule is 1000 MJ per shot.An energy yield of 250 GJ is equivalent to an energy yield of 250 x 10^3 MJHow would a Hybrid DT-DD Pure Fusion mini-PACER Power Plant Work?Here is a quick synopsis of how a pure 2-stage DT-DD mini-PACER fusion power plant would work.The mini-PACER cavity, which is 11 meters in diameter and 51 meters in length and of cylindrical shape vertically oriented is buried at 100 meters depth in the ground. The mini-PACER cavity is first pumped down to a soft vacuum; this reduces that pressure peak experienced inside the cavity while firing the pure fusion PPFD (peaceful pure fusion device).Concept Picture of a mini-PACER power plant -It is widely perceived that commercial forms of nuclear fusion are currently ~30 years away (and always will be) - but the reality is that such widespread and excessive pessimism about fusion is not justified.Practical fusion will always be 50+ years ago (not 50 years away)","3,658 followers",Brent Oster,3.6K,357,1.8M,2019,https://www.quora.com/How-efficient-is-the-nuclear-fusion-reactors-today

From having many long conversations with these very intelligent and qualified people I realized that thereI used to work on fusion simulation codes (particle in cell) with the US National Labs when I was at NVIDIA, and I was very interested in seeing if we could solve the problems with fusion and picked the scientist and engineers' brains endlessly. My former father-in-law also worked at Lawrence Berkeley Labs, and was an engineer designing superconducting coil magnets and had decades of experience working with fusion researchers, even though his primary application was particle accelerators. From having many long conversations with these very intelligent and qualified people I realized that there are some really hard problems that block practical fusion, with no immediate solutions in sight.The only place we know of working, large-scale, energy-generating fusion reactions is at the center of a star, where the gravity of the massive star creates the necessary density, temperature, and time being held in that state at the core for fusion reactions to run continuously. This is called the Lawson criteria, and is hard to achieve. All of the layers of the star above that act as an energy exchanger, converting all the gamma rays and fast neutrons at the core into progressively less energetic wavelengths of light and motion of nuclei (heat) so by the time they reach the surface of the star, that energy is emitted as IR and visible light that heats and powers our planet's biosphere, and can provide photovoltaic energy to us as well. All of our efforts in fusion have been to try and reproduce this process on earth, in a small reactor that can provide practical energy.First I will talk aboutThe first problem with magnetic confinement is fundamental - no matter how strong or well formed the magnetic field containing the plasma is, it will always leak, as positive nuclei or ions spiralling around the magnetic field lines collide and scatter, eventually drifting out of the containment field. The only known solution is to make the reactor larger so the scattering ions take longer to travel to the plasma boundary, and thus more fusion can happen during that time. Pretty brute force.The world's most advanced magnetic confinement fusion power plant is ITER, which, to reduce the ion scattering problem mentioned above, is 6-stories tall and about the same dimension in diameter, containing the mass of 3 Eiffel towers, and it is still not expected to be large enough to contain a plasma long enough to sustain burning and produce continuous energy generation.A more practical problem is how do we extract the energy? Most of the energy in deuterium-tritium fusion reactions is released in fast, high-energy neutrons, which (because they are neutral, and have no electric charge) are not confined by the magnetic field, don't heat up the plasma, and have to be stopped by a thick shield, which then heats up, and can vaporize water to steam in order to power turbines and electrical generators. The problem is the constant bombardment by neutrons makes the shield material degrade with time, and become very radioactive, posing a problem for removal and disposal.Also, deuterium-tritium fusion reactions are currently used because they take place at the lowest energies and at the lowest plasma temperatures of all the possible fusion fuels, and thus are easier to ignite and keep lit. However, tritium is not found naturally in any significant quantities and needs to be manufactured in nuclear reactors. With today's production capacity, we just cannot make enough tritium to power even ITER continuously. We could use better fuels, like Helium-3 or Boron-11, which do not emit neutrons and thus 'burn clean', but the plasma temperature must be much higher and the confinement much better to ignite fusion and sustain it with these fuels. And while Boron-11 is plentiful, Helium-3 is so rare that scientists think that the best source of it is lunar regolith that has been irradiated for billions of years on the moon's surface. Any energy generation infrastructure that requires a regular supply of a moon-based fuel, even as energy dense as He3, will probably never work out.A proposed solution to the Tritium deficit is to construct the shield surrounding the reactor with lithium, which is abundant, and fissions into tritium when struck by neutrons, thereby 'breeding' tritium within the reactor itself. Of course, this comes with its own set of problems of how to capture, purify, and contain the tritium after it is released into the tokamak reaction chamber from the walls.Another issue is that when all of the superconducting magnets in ITER are running at full current (160,000 amps) to create the 13 Tesla toroidal magnetic field (13x that in an MRI machine) and to create the other plasma-shaping and heating fields, they are storing 60 GigaJoules, or around 12 Tons of TNT worth of energy. This is because the 180 kilometers of superconducting Niobium-Tin wires in all these massive magnet coils can carry enormous electrical current when supercooled with liquid helium.More info on the ITER magnets:But, if that cooling fails, the superconductor heats up, quenches, and becomes a normal conductor, and can no longer carry that enormous current. With 160,000 amps suddenly meeting resistance, the coil rapidly vaporizes, and causes a meltdown of the other coils, with a total energy release of 12 tons of TNT. This is very undesirable, especially when those coils are wrapped around a highly radioactive shield that also vaporizes and is expelled into the atmosphere. There are fault-detection systems, but it takes a while to dissipate that amount of energy safely, and there may not be enough time to react quickly enough in the event of a catastrophic magnet coil failure.So, some gotchas left to solve for practical fusion energy generation with magnetic confinement, with some perhaps not so easily solved.Inertial confinement fusionIt also has many of the same problems with energy conversion to electricity, and much worse wear and tear on the shielding from these small nuclear fusion explosions being set off, which also trashes all the precision equipment needed to hold the fuel pellet in the focus of the converging laser beams with extreme accuracy. So, a lot of practical damage control problems before inertial confinement fusion is a practical source of energy generation.While these problems may be solved, practical application is still a very long way off, and currently the main application of inertial confinement fusion is as an experimental testbed for calibrating computer codes used to simulate and design thermonuclear fusion weapons. As horrific as these weapons may be, the simulation codes developed for designing them (sorry maintaining them), are the one of the greatest tools for innovation in fusion energy. There is a hydrodynamics code which simulates the behavior of the fissile (and fusion) materials under extreme conditions of pressure and temperature, as well as transport codes that model neutron transport and scattering in the materials under these conditions, and many other bits and bobs. They are all standard numerical techniques, and the really classified part is the integration and calibration of all these codes with previous nuclear weapon tests from the past, and with these small scale simulations in the present.Electrostatic Confinement FusionBasically you need a vacuum container the size of a basketball and a pump to empty it. You put a small spherical wire cage the size of a golf ball in the center, and a larger wire cage the size of a bowling ball around it. You then pump out all the air, and apply a very large (10,000V) electrical potential between the two cages, with the small negative cathode at the center, and the positive anode at the periphery.Then you open a valve and let in a very small amount of Deuterium gas (commercially available) into the vacuum chamber, and it ionizes in the large voltage potential, the D+ ions in the periphery experience a very strong electric field (100K V/m), and are rapidly accelerated towards the center of the reactor, with enough energy to collide and fuse the deuterium nuclei (no tritium required). This fusion can be measured with an external neutron counter.Theoretically, power generation would be simple, as the fusion products consisting of highly energetic He3 and (few) H3 ions could be decelerated in an electric field and the current from that used to generate electricity directly.Here is ECG Herman’s excellent thesis paper on designing and constructing a Farnsworth Fusor:Although they seem like a obvious winners due to their simplicity and effectiveness, ECF reactors have several things limiting scaling:a) There is a limit to the deuterium gas density before performance degrades, so generation capacity is limited.b) Deuterium ions tend to collide with the wire cage cathode in the center, which absorbs them, heating the cage, and causing energy loss and contamination from metal atoms being dislodged.c) As the deuterium ions oscillate back and forth through the center, each time they change direction, they emit bremsstrahlung radiation, or photons of light, losing energy (this is how your dentist’s x-ray machine works).d) Scattering tends to reduce the nice, radial trajectories of the ions into a Maxwellian distribution over time, reducing the fusion that occurs.There has been work in using electromagnets at the periphery to try and hold a ball of electrons in the center, eliminating the need for a central cage… akaThermonuclear WeaponsIn the Teller-Ulam, two-stage, thermonuclear weapon, a spherical plutonium fission primary (with deuterium-tritium fusion fuel at the core to boost it) is imploded by conventional explosives, the plutonium is crushed far beyond critical density, fissions and detonates. The initial radiation released is contained and focused onto the fusion secondary to implode it, ignite fusion, and detonate it. I just mention this to illustrate the enormous energy needed to really reach the Lawson criteria in a large scale, but nuclear weapons kind of freak me out, so I'm going to refer you to the link to the Wikipedia article about them if you want to read more:Thermonuclear weapon - WikipediaSo, in summary, we should not shut down or stop building today's fission nuclear reactors, as commercial fusion reactors are not only far in the future, but also produce radioactive waste (their shielding, which needs to be periodically replaced), and Tokamaks can melt down catastrophically and explode if there is a cooling failure in the magnet coils during full power operation. They also do not run on seawater, like some say. We need expensive and difficult to produce tritium (which is also radioactive) to ignite fusion at the temperatures and densities that today's tokamak magnetic fields can produce.To advance fusion energy in your career, I think the best fields to study would be physics (classical, electrodynamics, plasma, quantum, nuclear…) and computer science, with a focus on numerical simulation. The actual physical fusion reactors are so expensive and time-consuming to build, test, and operate, that you may only get to iterate designs once or twice in a career, but computer simulations can take us in so many different directions more cheaply and easily by comparison.Perhaps there is some exotic stellarator magnetic confinement design, or advanced Farnsworth electrostatic confinement design that has not been explored in depth, that will turn out to hold the key to fusion energy. Simulation is probably the best first step to find it, unless you have a few billion dollars and several hundred kilometers of Niobium-Tin wire and helium cooling tubing to play with.Brent",UNKNOWN,Viktor T.

The currently practical fusion technology is called fission-fusion, where nuclear fission is used to reliably produce the conditions for fusion.Mankind came into possession of a practical way of generating energy from fusion over 50 years ago with the Ivy-Mike nuclear test that produced fusion energy from pure Deuterium via DD fusion. Practical fusion will always be 50+ years ago (not 50 years away). Today, there are designs for smaller pure fusion devices designed to make clean energy (not blast effects) from pure DD fusion of Deuterium separated from sea water. One such design is called mini-Mike which is designed to produce a small predictable controlled energy yield of 250 GJ.It is widely perceived that commercial forms of nuclear fusion are currently ~50 years away (and always will be) - but the reality is that such widespread and excessive pessimism about fusion is not justified.The energy needed to ignite an inertially confined thermonuclear fusion reaction in liquid (or solid) deuterium-tritium (DT) is not that large; it is on the order of not more than 20 MJ or about the same amount of chemical energy stored in about 2.5 cups of automotive gasoline.The problem is that this energy for ICF fusion ignition must be compressed in space (focused down to an area less than a 2 mm) and in time (to less than 3 nanoseconds).Note: Deuterium separated from sea water is totally non-radioactive and fusion of this fuel produces only totally non-radioactive nuclear waste (helium).Fusion has many significant advantages when used in direct nuclear vehicle propulsion and may ultimately have advantages over gas and diesel cars -1) Fusion has no critical mass requirement; all that a fusion reaction requires is the right conditions be met (temperature, plasma density, and confinement time) to support fusion. As a result, very tiny fusion power plants can potentially be built.2) Fusion fuels are widely available in space. Hydrogen and an isotope of hydrogen called deuterium are the most abundant elements in the universe. Hydrogen is fully 10^10 times more abundant by atoms in the universe than any combination of fission fuels (U233, U235, and Pu239).3) When fusion fails to work, it tends to just flame out, and serious accidents and melt downs do not tend to happen4) Neutrons and gammas produced by fission reactors are hard to shield for vehicle or nuclear propulsion applications. Charged particles like protons produced from He3-He3 fusion are somewhat easier and more cost effective to shield. A combination of magnetic fields and electrostatic fields can be used to provide a low mass solution for biological shielding needed to provide excellent operator safety for mobile He3-He3 Inertial Confinement fusion reactors. Aneutronic fusion reactions like p-B11 and D-He3 are other good possibilities for fusion car applications and deserve close attention from designers.Helium3-Helium3 fusionHe3 + He3-> He4 + 2 protons + 12.86 MeV (energy)He3-He3 fusion produces only charged protons and energy (no difficult to shield neutrons at all).Charged Protons produced from He3-He3 fusion can be collected on light weight grids and screens and used to directly power electric motors that actually drive the wheels of a nuclear car. Neutronless He3-He3 fusion does not require an expensive precision turbine-generator to convert nuclear heat into electricity (for He3-He3 fusion, lower cost and lighter weight direct collection of charged particles on grids suffices).He3 fusion fuel is rare on earth but can be obtained from processing lunar regolith or potentially by synthetically manufacturing He3 in specially tuned D-D fusion reactors here on earth.A properly tuned D-D inertial confinement fusion reactor may be able to produce He3 on earth (so we may not have to go to the moon for it).D-D fusion is a practical reaction for energy production from inertial confinementIt is proposed (but not yet experimentally demonstrated) that there are a range of conditions (temperature, plasma density, and confinement time) that ICF D-D fusion reactors can be operated at that suppress the following D-D fusion side chainHe-3 + D -> He-4 + p + 18.34 MeVThis D-D fusion sidechain occurs at higher temperaturesand normally consumes the He3 produced inside a D-D fusion reactor. By properly tuning the operating conditions of a D-D ICF fusion reactor, it should be possible to make the ICF fusion reactor produce both fusion energy and He3 fuel.Manufacturing (2.3 x 10^13 metric tons) of He3 worldwide from modified D-D fusion of sea water would open up many fusion application that are now not seriously considered, including fueling nuclear fusion based transportation.Note: The amount of Deuterium in seawater is very vast (4.6 x 10^13 metric tons). The amount of He3 that could be produced from a modified form of D-D fusion that suppresses the He3 sidechain is similarly vast (2.3 x 10^13 metric tons).D-D fusion normally produces He3D-D Fusion of Deuterium fuel produces energy through four reactions:D + D -> He-3 + n + 3.268 MeVD + D -> T + p + 4.03 MeV(side chains)D + T -> He-4 + n + 17.588 MeVHe-3 + D -> He-4 + p + 18.34 MeVThe net effect of these four fusion reactions taken together is:6 D -> 2 He-4 + 2p + 2n + 43.243 MeVWill there ever be fusion cars?Early Magnetic Confinement Fusion power plants are likely to be very large and very stationary. ICF fusion power plants will probably be smaller than MCF fusion and may ultimately be of a size that could be installed in certain transportation vehicles (ships, trains, planes, trucks, and ultimately cars). What will probably be the most practical way to fusion powered vehicles (of a sort) for perhaps the next fifty years is to use stationary fusion power plants to produce electricity and then to use nuclear fusion produced electricity to charge conventional electric vehicles with storage batteries.Comparison of major fusion fuel cycles (including He3-He3)Chart of fusion fuels for mobile reactors and nuclear propulsion ----------","3,658 followers",Brent Oster,3.6K,357,1.8M,2019,https://www.quora.com/How-efficient-is-the-nuclear-fusion-reactors-today

This fusion can be measured with an external neutron counter.Theoretically, power generation would be simple, as the fusion products consisting of highly energetic He3 and (few) H3 ions could be decelerated in an electric field and the current from that used to generate electricity directly.Here is ECG Herman’s excellent thesis paper on designing and constructing a Farnsworth Fusor:Although they seem like a obvious winners due to their simplicity and effectiveness, ECF reactors have several things limiting scaling:a) There is a limit to the deuterium gas density before performance degrades, so generation capacity is limited.b) Deuterium ions tend to collide with the wire cage cathode in the center, which absorbs them, heating the cage, and causing energy loss and contamination from metal atoms being dislodged.c) As the deuterium ions oscillate back and forth through the center, each time they change direction, they emit bremsstrahlung radiation, or photons of light, losing energy (this is how your dentist’s x-ray machine works).d) Scattering tends to reduce the nice, radial trajectories of the ions into a Maxwellian distribution over time, reducing the fusion that occurs.There has been work in using electromagnets at the periphery to try and hold a ball of electrons in the center, eliminating the need for a central cage… akaThermonuclear WeaponsIn the Teller-Ulam, two-stage, thermonuclear weapon, a spherical plutonium fission primary (with deuterium-tritium fusion fuel at the core to boost it) is imploded by conventional explosives, the plutonium is crushed far beyond critical density, fissions and detonates. The initial radiation released is contained and focused onto the fusion secondary to implode it, ignite fusion, and detonate it. I just mention this to illustrate the enormous energy needed to really reach the Lawson criteria in a large scale, but nuclear weapons kind of freak me out, so I'm going to refer you to the link to the Wikipedia article about them if you want to read more:Thermonuclear weapon - WikipediaSo, in summary, we should not shut down or stop building today's fission nuclear reactors, as commercial fusion reactors are not only far in the future, but also produce radioactive waste (their shielding, which needs to be periodically replaced), and Tokamaks can melt down catastrophically and explode if there is a cooling failure in the magnet coils during full power operation. They also do not run on seawater, like some say. We need expensive and difficult to produce tritium (which is also radioactive) to ignite fusion at the temperatures and densities that today's tokamak magnetic fields can produce.To advance fusion energy in your career, I think the best fields to study would be physics (classical, electrodynamics, plasma, quantum, nuclear…) and computer science, with a focus on numerical simulation. The actual physical fusion reactors are so expensive and time-consuming to build, test, and operate, that you may only get to iterate designs once or twice in a career, but computer simulations can take us in so many different directions more cheaply and easily by comparison.Perhaps there is some exotic stellarator magnetic confinement design, or advanced Farnsworth electrostatic confinement design that has not been explored in depth, that will turn out to hold the key to fusion energy. Simulation is probably the best first step to find it, unless you have a few billion dollars and several hundred kilometers of Niobium-Tin wire and helium cooling tubing to play with.Brent","5,361 followers",Valerio Cietto,1.1K,2.4K,9.1M,2021,https://www.quora.com/How-efficient-is-the-nuclear-fusion-reactors-today

Populationeasier to solve.It is widely perceived that commercial forms of nuclear fusion are currently ~50 years away (and always will be) - but the reality is that such widespread and excessive pessimism about fusion is not justified.Practical fusion will always be 50+ years ago (not 50 years away)Mankind came into possession of a practical way of generating energy from fusion over 50 years ago with the Ivy-Mike nuclear test that used impure fission-fusion to produce fusion energy. Ivy-Mike was mankind’s first successful approach to reliably producing fusion energy from pure Deuterium via DD fusion while using a small nuclear fission device to bring Deuterium fusion plasma to fusion conditions (temperature, confinement time, and plasma density). Today, there are much smaller pure fusion devices designed to make clean energy (not blast effects) from pure DD fusion of Deuterium separated from sea water. One such design is called mini-Mike, which is designed to produce a small predictable controlled energy yield of 250 GJ of energy per shot.The energy needed to ignite an inertially confined thermonuclear fusion reaction in liquid (or solid) deuterium-tritium (DT) is not that large; it is on the order of not more than 20 MJ or about the same amount of chemical energy as would be released when efficiently burning about 2.5 cups of automotive gasoline.The problem is that this energy must be compressed in space (focused down to a spot of less than a 2 mm diameter) and in time (to less than 3 nanoseconds).Mini-Mike pure fusion deviceA laser or ion-beam fusion driver irradiates a D-T filled beryllium micro-sphere from the left, which initiates D-T fusion which in turn launches a radiative shock detonation wave down a pressurized liquid deuterium filled tube.Cold War era Halite-Centurion field test experiments[1] showed that an intense beam of X-rays is sufficient to produce full fusion ignition of small amounts (grams) of Deuterium-Tritium fuel held in small hollow spheres mounted at a remote distance from the X-ray source.Successful ICF DT fusion ignition is not a matter of conjecture or technical speculation but is rather an observed fact. With the 1952 Ivy-Mike test, ICF fusion moved from just another fusion technology of promise to a practical fusion technology that could be repeatedly demonstrated on demand.This puts ICF fusion in a slightly different position than any other form of fusion today. Technical demonstration of ignition has been experimentally demonstrated. A practical form of ICF fusion has been experimentally shown to repeatedly work in independent experiments fielded by both LLNL and LANL Field Test Divisions over the course of ~10 years (Halite-Centurion series tests).After more than sixty years of experiments in hundreds of different experimental fusion devices and hundreds of thousands of separate shots, only ICF fusion has experimentally demonstrated fusion ignition and fusion net energy generation.For a brief period in the mid-1970s (Nixon Administration), the major US DOE Labs considered building practical fusion reactors based on the form of ICF nuclear fusion we currently can reliably achieve. These experiments and designs were part of PACER program, which was only active as a project for about 3 years and did not result in actual fusion reactor hardware (but which did result in preliminary ultra-clean PACER device designs which efficiently maximize production of energy from fusion while minimizing the energy from fission required to initiate each fission-fusion shot). Project PACER also produced preliminary PACER reactor designs.PACER fusion - ""PACER Revisited"" -The Nixon Administration, in a mid-1970s effort intended to try to keep a campaign promise to balance the Federal Budget, cut both Thorium Molten Salt Reactor and PACER Fusion research as cost cutting measures at approximately the same time.The Dr. Ralph Moir ""PACER Revisited"" paper contains a description of the LLNL small closer to commercial molten salt version of PACER.http://www.ralphmoir.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/pacerRev891.pdfIn the intervening 40 years advances in design of pure fusion experimental devices have been made (but no experimental pure fusion devices have as yet been built or successfully tested).Inertial confinement fusion is the only form of fusion that has actually already been proven to work in actual field experiments (not just in computer simulations). In the final few years on underground nuclear testing, both LANL and LLNL designed a series of test shots called Halite-Centurion. Halite-Centurion series shots were fusion related add on shots piggy-backed onto DOE-DOD shots already on the schedule. These shots were designed to utilize a small portion of the X-rays produced from the primary of an experimental device through a line of sight to ignite a remote fusion experiment housed some distance away in the underground experimental test canister.Once classified Halite-Centurion test shots experimentally proved that small DT filled spheres could be ignited and brought to full fusion ignition using an intense beam of X-rays.ICF fusion has been experimentallyIf fusion drivers are designed that sufficiently resemble the characteristics and performance of X-ray driver used in Halite-Centurion experiments, there is no question that full fusion ignition with fusion energy gain will be practically achieved. Practical fusion is not a matter of guesswork or conjecture but has already been PROVEN in actual field experiments by both LANL and LLNL National Labs in the last years of underground nuclear testing at the Nevada Nuclear Security Site.[1] - NY Times article published at the time of Halite-Centurion field tests -",826 followers,George Dowson,4K,527,3.7M,2018,https://www.quora.com/How-efficient-is-the-nuclear-fusion-reactors-today

It is remarkable that we (as a species) are even attempting it and more remarkable that we may well succeed.People seem to think that fusion is relatively easy, but it really isn’t. Even in the core of the sun, fusion generates only a small amount of net heat. A cubic metre of the sun’s fusing core only generates around 275 watts. That’s less energy output than we give off as body heat for an equivalent volume. The reason why the sun is so hot is because there are hundreds of thousands of miles of insulation (in the form of hot gas contained by gravity) around this heating centre.There’s a reason stars burn for billions of years, they really only burn slowly.Now consider the conditions at the core of the sun - 250 billion atmospheres, 15 million degrees (K or C doesn’t matter at this scale). And that is sufficient to make a piddly amount of heat per cubic metre. Scaled down to operations that would fit on Earth, that’s not going to cut it for power generation. You’d get more power out of a single large solar panel in good conditions. (That might seem odd but consider the sheer size of the sun, even “just” the core region).What’s more, we can’t achieve those sorts of pressures so we need much higher temperatures before we even start fusion; closer to 100 million degrees. We then need to surround this heating zone with the kind of insulation a few hundred thousand miles worth of mind-bogglingly dense gas and plasma provides (using superpowered magnets), and then we have to extract sensible energy without causing the whole reaction to stall and still end up with enough energy to outweigh the inevitable energy losses.I hope this gives you an idea of what an achievement creating a working fusion power plant will be.

Energy is critical for society’s growth and success.Current government research indicates that fusion reactors will require massive structures and be phenomenally expensive. On the other hand, there are also ""amateur"" scientists working in their garages -- their devices are much smaller (and fit the tiny budgets they have).If the government research pans out, except for potential environmental improvements, there won't be a major change to society when fusion comes online. Although raw fuel costs may be reduced, the same distribution methods will be required and the capital costs will remain astronomical.At the other extreme, one can imagine a ""lucky"" inventor developing a small fusion reactor in his basement that powers micro-grids. If this happens, the cost of energy will plummet over the following twenty five years. Fuel costs go to essentially zero. Distribution and transmission costs (over 40% of the cost today) are substantially reduced or eliminated. The remaining costs are capital expenditures and maintenance. Depending on the shielding required, these devices may be inexpensive to build. Maybe like today's portable generators, but with a containment vessel. In this highly speculative scenario, electricity might be as low as 1/10th of today's cost. If so, electricity availability worldwide will grow substantially.(The same thing can be said of other clean/renewable, micro-grid capable sources. Fusion's advantage is that it 'burns' a fuel and is therefore available 24/7. The advantage of the other sources is that they're real and available today)Regardless of the scenario, large or small, if fusion comes online at a price-point significantly below fossil fuel systems, oil-propped regimes will teeter and fail. Wars may break out in the middle-east. But, because oil will be much less important, outside meddling will be significantly reduced. Also, several of the world's largest companies will become irrelevant.If the cost of energy falls (and AI takes over), the cost of ground and sea transportation will becomes primarily a capital expense. Because shielding is heavy, air travel will remain fossil-fuel based until aneutronic reactors are available, small, and light.If fusion (or any of the clean/renewables) takes off in a way that obviates fossil fuels, the environment stops incurring the associated deleterious effects.If fusion reduces the financial and carbon costs sufficiently, many projects become much more viable, such as desalination plants and energy-intensive carbon-capture processes. Maybe we can start repairing the environmental damage already done.The cost of energy is embedded in virtually everything we use. Aluminum, for example, is created using massive amounts of electricity. The food we eat requires energy to plant, grow, harvest, process, transport, sell, and cook. Offices and homes are illuminated, heated, and cooled. The device you're reading this uses electricity.Reducing the cost of energy means everyone has a bit more for themselves. The energy sector is about a five trillion dollar industry, a bit over $500 per person annually. The average annual worldwide per-capita income is under $3,500.

My former father-in-law also worked at Lawrence Berkeley Labs, and was an engineer designing superconducting coil magnets and had decades of experience working with fusion researchers, even though his primary application was particle accelerators. From having many long conversations with these very intelligent and qualified people I realized that there are some really hard problems that block practical fusion, with no immediate solutions in sight.The only place we know of working, large-scale, energy-generating fusion reactions is at the center of a star, where the gravity of the massive star creates the necessary density, temperature, and time being held in that state at the core for fusion reactions to run continuously. This is called the Lawson criteria, and is hard to achieve. All of the layers of the star above that act as an energy exchanger, converting all the gamma rays and fast neutrons at the core into progressively less energetic wavelengths of light and motion of nuclei (heat) so by the time they reach the surface of the star, that energy is emitted as IR and visible light that heats and powers our planet's biosphere, and can provide photovoltaic energy to us as well. All of our efforts in fusion have been to try and reproduce this process on earth, in a small reactor that can provide practical energy.First I will talk aboutThe first problem with magnetic confinement is fundamental - no matter how strong or well formed the magnetic field containing the plasma is, it will always leak, as positive nuclei or ions spiralling around the magnetic field lines collide and scatter, eventually drifting out of the containment field. The only known solution is to make the reactor larger so the scattering ions take longer to travel to the plasma boundary, and thus more fusion can happen during that time. Pretty brute force.The world's most advanced magnetic confinement fusion power plant is ITER, which, to reduce the ion scattering problem mentioned above, is 6-stories tall and about the same dimension in diameter, containing the mass of 3 Eiffel towers, and it is still not expected to be large enough to contain a plasma long enough to sustain burning and produce continuous energy generation.A more practical problem is how do we extract the energy? Most of the energy in deuterium-tritium fusion reactions is released in fast, high-energy neutrons, which (because they are neutral, and have no electric charge) are not confined by the magnetic field, don't heat up the plasma, and have to be stopped by a thick shield, which then heats up, and can vaporize water to steam in order to power turbines and electrical generators. The problem is the constant bombardment by neutrons makes the shield material degrade with time, and become very radioactive, posing a problem for removal and disposal.Also, deuterium-tritium fusion reactions are currently used because they take place at the lowest energies and at the lowest plasma temperatures of all the possible fusion fuels, and thus are easier to ignite and keep lit. However, tritium is not found naturally in any significant quantities and needs to be manufactured in nuclear reactors. With today's production capacity, we just cannot make enough tritium to power even ITER continuously. We could use better fuels, like Helium-3 or Boron-11, which do not emit neutrons and thus 'burn clean', but the plasma temperature must be much higher and the confinement much better to ignite fusion and sustain it with these fuels. And while Boron-11 is plentiful, Helium-3 is so rare that scientists think that the best source of it is lunar regolith that has been irradiated for billions of years on the moon's surface. Any energy generation infrastructure that requires a regular supply of a moon-based fuel, even as energy dense as He3, will probably never work out.A proposed solution to the Tritium deficit is to construct the shield surrounding the reactor with lithium, which is abundant, and fissions into tritium when struck by neutrons, thereby 'breeding' tritium within the reactor itself. Of course, this comes with its own set of problems of how to capture, purify, and contain the tritium after it is released into the tokamak reaction chamber from the walls.Another issue is that when all of the superconducting magnets in ITER are running at full current (160,000 amps) to create the 13 Tesla toroidal magnetic field (13x that in an MRI machine) and to create the other plasma-shaping and heating fields, they are storing 60 GigaJoules, or around 12 Tons of TNT worth of energy. This is because the 180 kilometers of superconducting Niobium-Tin wires in all these massive magnet coils can carry enormous electrical current when supercooled with liquid helium.More info on the ITER magnets:But, if that cooling fails, the superconductor heats up, quenches, and becomes a normal conductor, and can no longer carry that enormous current. With 160,000 amps suddenly meeting resistance, the coil rapidly vaporizes, and causes a meltdown of the other coils, with a total energy release of 12 tons of TNT. This is very undesirable, especially when those coils are wrapped around a highly radioactive shield that also vaporizes and is expelled into the atmosphere. There are fault-detection systems, but it takes a while to dissipate that amount of energy safely, and there may not be enough time to react quickly enough in the event of a catastrophic magnet coil failure.So, some gotchas left to solve for practical fusion energy generation with magnetic confinement, with some perhaps not so easily solved.Inertial confinement fusionIt also has many of the same problems with energy conversion to electricity, and much worse wear and tear on the shielding from these small nuclear fusion explosions being set off, which also trashes all the precision equipment needed to hold the fuel pellet in the focus of the converging laser beams with extreme accuracy. So, a lot of practical damage control problems before inertial confinement fusion is a practical source of energy generation.While these problems may be solved, practical application is still a very long way off, and currently the main application of inertial confinement fusion is as an experimental testbed for calibrating computer codes used to simulate and design thermonuclear fusion weapons. As horrific as these weapons may be, the simulation codes developed for designing them (sorry maintaining them), are the one of the greatest tools for innovation in fusion energy. There is a hydrodynamics code which simulates the behavior of the fissile (and fusion) materials under extreme conditions of pressure and temperature, as well as transport codes that model neutron transport and scattering in the materials under these conditions, and many other bits and bobs. They are all standard numerical techniques, and the really classified part is the integration and calibration of all these codes with previous nuclear weapon tests from the past, and with these small scale simulations in the present.Electrostatic Confinement FusionBasically you need a vacuum container the size of a basketball and a pump to empty it. You put a small spherical wire cage the size of a golf ball in the center, and a larger wire cage the size of a bowling ball around it. You then pump out all the air, and apply a very large (10,000V) electrical potential between the two cages, with the small negative cathode at the center, and the positive anode at the periphery.Then you open a valve and let in a very small amount of Deuterium gas (commercially available) into the vacuum chamber, and it ionizes in the large voltage potential, the D+ ions in the periphery experience a very strong electric field (100K V/m), and are rapidly accelerated towards the center of the reactor, with enough energy to collide and fuse the deuterium nuclei (no tritium required). This fusion can be measured with an external neutron counter.Theoretically, power generation would be simple, as the fusion products consisting of highly energetic He3 and (few) H3 ions could be decelerated in an electric field and the current from that used to generate electricity directly.Here is ECG Herman’s excellent thesis paper on designing and constructing a Farnsworth Fusor:Although they seem like a obvious winners due to their simplicity and effectiveness, ECF reactors have several things limiting scaling:a) There is a limit to the deuterium gas density before performance degrades, so generation capacity is limited.b) Deuterium ions tend to collide with the wire cage cathode in the center, which absorbs them, heating the cage, and causing energy loss and contamination from metal atoms being dislodged.c) As the deuterium ions oscillate back and forth through the center, each time they change direction, they emit bremsstrahlung radiation, or photons of light, losing energy (this is how your dentist’s x-ray machine works).d) Scattering tends to reduce the nice, radial trajectories of the ions into a Maxwellian distribution over time, reducing the fusion that occurs.There has been work in using electromagnets at the periphery to try and hold a ball of electrons in the center, eliminating the need for a central cage… akaThermonuclear WeaponsIn the Teller-Ulam, two-stage, thermonuclear weapon, a spherical plutonium fission primary (with deuterium-tritium fusion fuel at the core to boost it) is imploded by conventional explosives, the plutonium is crushed far beyond critical density, fissions and detonates. The initial radiation released is contained and focused onto the fusion secondary to implode it, ignite fusion, and detonate it. I just mention this to illustrate the enormous energy needed to really reach the Lawson criteria in a large scale, but nuclear weapons kind of freak me out, so I'm going to refer you to the link to the Wikipedia article about them if you want to read more:Thermonuclear weapon - WikipediaSo, in summary, we should not shut down or stop building today's fission nuclear reactors, as commercial fusion reactors are not only far in the future, but also produce radioactive waste (their shielding, which needs to be periodically replaced), and Tokamaks can melt down catastrophically and explode if there is a cooling failure in the magnet coils during full power operation. They also do not run on seawater, like some say. We need expensive and difficult to produce tritium (which is also radioactive) to ignite fusion at the temperatures and densities that today's tokamak magnetic fields can produce.To advance fusion energy in your career, I think the best fields to study would be physics (classical, electrodynamics, plasma, quantum, nuclear…) and computer science, with a focus on numerical simulation. The actual physical fusion reactors are so expensive and time-consuming to build, test, and operate, that you may only get to iterate designs once or twice in a career, but computer simulations can take us in so many different directions more cheaply and easily by comparison.Perhaps there is some exotic stellarator magnetic confinement design, or advanced Farnsworth electrostatic confinement design that has not been explored in depth, that will turn out to hold the key to fusion energy. Simulation is probably the best first step to find it, unless you have a few billion dollars and several hundred kilometers of Niobium-Tin wire and helium cooling tubing to play with.Brent","3,658 followers",Brent Oster,3.6K,357,1.8M,2021,https://www.quora.com/How-efficient-is-the-nuclear-fusion-reactors-today

It should be perhaps compared side by side in detail:CostCost of nuclear fuel is negligible both for fusion and fission, in both cases the main part of electricity cost would be amortization of initial investment to build the machine.Fusion technology (superconductor, vacuum vessels, cryogenic cooling, plasma tech …) is much more technologically advanced, and almost certainly much more costly (per Mega Watt) than fission tech. In contrast fission power is very simple - you just put nearly-critical mass of nuclear fuel to water boiler, and it “burns” by itself (it is almost miracle how easy it is in principle).On the other hand, fission power plant are becoming more and more costly due to added safety features (e.g. huge confinement building around etc.). Since fusion is inherently more safe (there is less stored energy for explosion and much less of radioactive material for leak) it does not require invest so much into added safety. Still I don’t think it will pay off the hugely costly hi-tech. Also new generation fission reactors (Unfavourable property of (fission) nuclear power plant is their size. Large powerplant is cheaper (per Mega Watt). This is even much more true for Tokamak based fusion power plant due to scalling law of magnetic confinement, only multi-Giga-watt reactor can achieve net energy gain (inertial confinement may be different). In this respect it is much more realistic to build small fission reactors than fusion reactors.Radiation safetyFusion reactor produce huge amount of energetic neutrons (while fission neutrons has energy ~2MeV, fusion neutron ~15MeV). These neutrons are hard to shield and cause serious radiation damage to materials.The main advantage of fusion reactor is that the amount of radioactive material stored inside (<1kg plasma) is much lower than in fission reactor (>100ton - including moderator and coolant) which makes huge difference in case of accident. Nevertheless, the mass of irradiated reactor components is comparable. Also if tritium is produced by irradiation of lithium cooling blanket, the volume of radioactive material will be comparable.The other huge advantage is that nuclear fusion istelf (unlike fission) does not produce broad variety of long-live radioactive reaction products (like radioctive iodine, stroncium, or trans-uran actinoides). But very radioctive products can be formed by irradiation of the surrounding structural material by the neutrons. This can be to large degree managed by choice of the materials, although this choice may be limited since the material mus at the same time fullfill other requrements (thermal shielding, strenght, conductivity…).Nuclear ProliferationSince fusion reactor is great neutron source, it can be used to breed various nuclear materials including plutonium-239. But since breeding is based on neutron capture which require slow neutrons (fast neutron cause fission instead), fission reactors with slow neutron spectrum are more suitable for this purpose.Space applicationDespite fission nuclear energy seems to be favourable for common energy generation on Earth, in space it is different story. In space you have plenty of vacuum, cryogenic cooling, but you are limited by mass. Therefore you may prefer to create huge (but light) open magnetic chamber open to ambient vacuum with radiative cooling, rather than 1000ton steel boiler filled with water.The only method how to achieve high specific impulse and high thrust at the same time, is pulsed nuclear power (since it is impossible to continuously confine and cool respective power density). Fusion pulsed power can be miniaturized better than fission pulsed power, since you are not limited by critical mass and low neutron crossection.Also in space Deuterium, Tritium and He-3 is easier to harvest than uranium and thorium.",UNKNOWN,Viktor T.
