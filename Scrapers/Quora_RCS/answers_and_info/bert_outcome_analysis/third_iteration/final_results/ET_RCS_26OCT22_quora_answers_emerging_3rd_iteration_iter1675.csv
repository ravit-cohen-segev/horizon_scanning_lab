I've tried to learn coding without context and application, and I've almost never come out of it with any meaningful skills.When I learned python 3 years ago, I wanted to create websites.  It shouldn't come as a shock to anyone that the best way to learn how to do this was to create websites.1.  Find what motivates youFinding and keeping your motivation is key -- I slept through a lot of the one high school programming class I took because it made us memorize a bunch of syntax.  On the other hand, when I needed to learn python to make an automated essay scoring algorithm, I stayed up many late nights learning and iterating.Motivation is rarely addressed in learning -- you're often just given a list of generic tutorials to try, and told to go do them.  But the great thing about python is that you can develop almost anything, from mobile apps to games to advanced machine learning algorithms.  No matter what you're interested in, you can probably build it in python, and there's probably a good getting started tutorial.Pick an area or two that you're interested in, and stick with them-- you'll be developing quite a few projects in the areas.Here are some sample areas, but feel free to add your own:2.  Learn some basic python syntaxUnless you know the basic syntax, it's hard to implement anything.  That said, don't spend too long on this.  The goal is to learn the very basics, so you know enough to start working on your own projects in your areas(s) of interest.For reference, I spent less than a week on codecademy, and went through about 30% of the material.  This was enough to get started on a project.Some resources that can help you:CodecademyI can't emphasize enough that you should only spend the minimum amount of upfront time possible on basic syntax.  The quicker you can get to working on projects, the faster you will learn.  You can always refer back to the syntax when you get stuck later.3.  Make structured projects in your chosen areaUnless you actually apply your knowledge, you won't be able to retain it well.  Projects are a great way to learn because they push your capabilities, show you how to apply skills, and give you a portfolio to show employers in the future.When you start out, it can be helpful to have more structured projects with some guidance.  Here are a few ideas:GamesWebsitesMobile appsData science4.  Work on projects on your ownOnce you have learned the concepts in a guided manner, it's time to work on some projects on your own.  You'll still need to consult references and look up concepts, but you'll be fitting what you learn into the needs of your project, not the other way around.Finding other people to work with here can both help you learn and help keep you motivated.Some ideas:My first project was adapting my automated essay scoring algorithm from R into python.  It didn't end up looking pretty, but it started me on the journey to learning python.The key is to pick something and do it.  If you get too hung up on picking the perfect project, there's a risk that you'll never make one.5.  Keep working on harder projectsKeep increasing the difficulty and scope of your projects.  If you're completely comfortable with what you're building, it means it's time to try something harder.Here are some ideas for when that time comes:Going forwardAt the end of the day, python is evolving and changing all the time.  There are probably only a few people who can legitimately claim to completely understand it.You'll need to be constantly learning and working on projects.  If you do this right, you'll find yourself looking back on your code from 6 months ago and thinking about how terrible it is.  If you get to this point, you're on the right track.Python is a really fun and rewarding language to learn, and I think anyone can get to a high level of proficiency in it if they find the right motivation.",0 followers,Krushna M,523,0,0,2015,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-upcoming-technology-which-would-shake-everybody-up

This success also reveals a promising future scope of python programming language.In fact, it has been continuously serving as the best programming language for application development, web development, game development, system administration, scientific and numeric computing, GIS and Mapping etc.Why Is Python So Popular?The reason behind immense popularity of python programming language across the globe is the features it provides. Have a look at the features of python language.(1) Python Supports Multiple Programming ParadigmsPython is a multi paradigm programming language including features such as object oriented, imperative, procedural, functional, reflective etc.(2) Python Has Large Set Of Library and ToolsPython has very extensive standard libraries and tools that enhance the overall functionality of python language and also helps python programmers to easily write codes. Some of the important python libraries and tools are listed below.Built-in functions, constants, types and exceptions.File formats, file and directory access, multimedia services.GUI development tools such as tkInterCustom Python Interpreters, Internet protocols and support, data compression and archiving, modules etc.Scrapy, wxPython, SciPy, matplotlib, Pygame, PyQT, PyGTK etc.(3) Python Has a Vast Community SupportThis is what makes python a favourable choice for development purposes. If you are having problems writing python a program, you can post directly to python community and will get response with the solution of your problem. You will also find many new ideas regarding python technology and change in the versions.(4) Python is Designed For Better Code ReadabilityPython provides a much better code readability as compared to another programming language. For example, it uses whitespace indentation in place of curly brackets for delimiting block of codes. Isn’t it awesome?(5) Python Contains Fewer Lines Of CodesCodes written in python programming language complete in fewer lines thus reducing efforts of programmers. Let’s have a look on the following “Hello World” program written in C, C++, Java and Python.While, C, C++ and Java takes six, seven and five lines respectively for a simple “Hello World” program. Python takes only a single line which means, less coding effort and time is required for writing the same program.Future Technologies Counting On PythonGenerally, we have seen that python programming language is extensively used for web development, application development, system administration, developing games etc.But do you know there are some future technologies that are relying on python. As a matter of fact, python has become the core language as far as the success of these technologies are concerned. Let’s dive into the technologies which uses python as a core element for research, production and further developments.(1) Artificial IntelligencePython programming language is undoubtedly dominating the other languages when future technologies like Artificial Intelligence(AI) comes into the play.There are plenty of python frameworks, libraries and tools that are specifically developed to direct Artificial Intelligence to reduce human efforts with increased accuracy and efficiency for various development purposes.It is only the Artificial Intelligence that has made it possible to develop speech recognition system, autonomous cars, interpreting data like images, videos etc.We have shown below some of the python libraries and tools used in various Artificial Intelligence branches.Machine LearningGeneral AI- pyDatalog, AIMA, EasyAI, SimpleAI etc.Neural Networks- PyAnn, pyrenn, ffnet, neurolab etc.Natural Language & Text Processing- Quepy, NLTK, gensim(2) Big DataThe future scope of python programming language can also be predicted by the way it has helped big data technology to grow. Python has been successfully contributing in analysing the large amount of data sets across computer clusters through its high performance toolkits and libraries.Let’s have a look at the python libraries and toolkits used for Data analysis and handling other big data issues.PandasScikit-LearnNumPySciPyGraphLab CreateIPythonBokehAgatePySparkDask(3) NetworkingNetworking is the another field in which python has a brighter scope in the future. Python programming language is used to read, write and configure routers and switches and perform other networking automation tasks in a cost effective and secure manner.For these purposes, there are many libraries and tools that are built on the top of python language. Here we have listed some of these python libraries and tools especially used by network engineers for network automation.AnsibleNetmikoNAPALM(Network Automation and Programmability Abstraction Layer with Multivendor Support)PyeapiJunos PyEZPySNMPParamiko SSHReal-Life Python Success StoriesPython has seemingly contributed as a core language for increasing productivity regarding various development purposes at many of the IT organizations. We have shown below some of the real-life python success stories.Australia’s RMA Department D-Link has successfully implemented python for creating DSL Firmware Recovery System.Python has helpedForecastWatchPython has also benefitted many product development companies such as Acqutek, AstraZeneca, GravityZoo, Carmanah Technologies Inc. etc in creating autonomous devices and softwares.Test&Go uses python scripts for Data Validation.Industrial Light & Magic(ILM) also uses python for batch processing that includes modeling, rendering and compositing thousands of picture frames per day.There is huge list of success stories of many organizations across the globe which are using python for various purposes such as software development, data mining, unit testing, product development, web development, data validation, data visualization etc.These success stories directly points towards a promising future scope of python programming language.Top Competitors Of PythonThe future scope of python programming language also depends on its competitors in the IT market. But, due the fact that it has become a core language for future technologies such as artificial intelligence, big data, etc., it will surely gonna rise further and will be able to beat its competitors.Tiobe IndexAccording to Tiobe Index for October 2017, python is among the top five popular programming languages and has left behind Php, Swift, Javascript, Perl, Ruby, R.The only languages which are slightly ahead of python in terms of popularity ratings are Java, C, C++ and C#. These figures will shortly going to change after seeing the growing popularity and high adoption of python programming language.PYPL IndexAnother Index that measures popularity of programming languages is PYPL. And according to PYPL(PopularitY of Programming Language) index, Python has secured second position in India and Germany, Java being the only language ahead of it.But in other countries like U.K, U.S.A and France, Python has seized the top position beating its toughest competitor Java in terms of popularity.DatanyzeAccording toThe top three competitors of Python in India are listed below along with their market shares and current websites.The Official Microsoft ASP.NET SiteMarket Share- 39.53%Current Websites- 41,052JavaMarket Share- 4.03%Current Websites- 4,186C#Market Share- 1.97%Current Websites- 2,042Websites Developed Using PythonAs you already know that python programming language is used for web development, so here are some of the world’s most popular websites that are created using python.YoutubeQuoraInstagramPinterestSpotifyFlipkartSlackUberClouderaZenefitsOrganizations Using Python LanguageThere are many small and big organizations and startups as well that are immensely using Python to improve their productivity and meet customer requirements.Even the governmental organizations are using python to maintain and add more functionality to their website.
