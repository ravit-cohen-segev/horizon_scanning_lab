That means they simply need people who are working for the businesses rather than anything groundbreaking.Even now the system is not about creating people who know what they want and are eager to contribute, it is about forcing them to become the perfect workers for the economy.The curriculum is meant to ensure that all our time is filled up, chasing something that is detrimental rather than just say worthless.

If you see United nation or developed countries like America, then you will find that we are so so far from that countries. No doubt, our nation is developing so fast after all, India is a country of youth.But In reality, there is no job for our so called youth because lack of pragmatic knowledge.And we learn that things which has no use in real life.Like: Patterns of IITs, for admission in these prestigious institution,we have to learn Physics, chemistry and math very deeply.I HAVE AN EXAMPLE TO ELABORATE IT :Tanmay Bakshi:Well known personality in the field of coding and the first thing which is really so amazing is that he started coding at a age of 5 years.But if he would be in A country Like India then I don’t think so that he would be able to code at the age of 5. Perhaps, first he would start JEE and Advanced preparations for achieving a Computer Science In iits which would be totally discusting.Indeed, we need a change in our education system according to interests of our children and students.(No doudt, we are so talented after all Tanmay Bhakshi is also an Indian.)But Our Education System is Like: Jo ho raha hai chalne do(Just go with the flow)Firstly for changing in our education system, first we need a good people in a system who really wants changes and work along with normal people.Secondly, we have to find our clear goal in life according to our intersts like somebody wants to make career in a fashion technology, Modeling, Dramas, Acting, singer, Sports, Coding, Hacking etc.How we can change our education system:Just my point of view:)cool:)",18 followers,Asim Qureshi,810,996,156.1M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Suppose-all-humans-disappeared-right-now-and-no-traces-of-humanity-were-left-behind-like-a-global-reset-button-If-humans-evolved-via-the-same-ancestors-we-did-again-would-technology-develop-in-a-similar-fashion-the-second-time-around
