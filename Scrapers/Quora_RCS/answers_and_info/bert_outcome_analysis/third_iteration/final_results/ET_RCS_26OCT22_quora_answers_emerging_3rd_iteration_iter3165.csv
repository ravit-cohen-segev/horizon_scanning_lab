1,"First of all, let’s define what do you mean by investment?When you put your money in something you think will appreciate in price - it’s not an investment, It’s speculation.

A balanced portfolio is 50% BTC and 50% alts.Now one good question is:My best advice would be to look for a specific industry you’re good at and diversify. There are coins literally for every popular industry: gaming, finance, privacy, content, commodities, etc.Simply don’t bet on an altcoin, let’s say, from the gaming industry without considering its competitor. Never put money in a single coin better go for the whole industry.Wrapping things up,Depending on the time you’re reading this, alts or BTC (or both) may be on the rise or downfall. This shouldn’t discourage you.The most important thing to consider is your portfolio strategy, you might be right with your picks or you might be wrong - stick to your strategy, and at least you can find out where you were wrong.When you change your mind 100 times (I’d appreciate it if you can upvote this, and take a look at my profile.

3,"To make a long story short, you don’t need much money to buy Altcoins. If you’re nervous about making your first purchase, consider starting small. This limits your risk and gives you time to decide if it’s right for your investment goals.

The first is that gas fees have become very expensive in the last couple of years because the network has become so popular and is therefore very congested.Validators prioritise users who are willing to pay the highest fees for their transactions.Bitcoin has comparable issues with congestion, scalability and speed which is why it is treated more like a store of value.DeFi depends on liquidity, scalability, security and decentralization.But now the age is of DeFi 2.OTo better understand the relevance of DeFi 2.0, we can explore some of the more common problems it’s trying to solve.Liquidity: Providing liquidity to a pool requires a lock-up of funds and their total value. While separated across disparate blockchains and markets, this financial rigidity often results in capital inefficiency.Liquidity Mining: Many DeFi protocols suffer from a lack of long-term, practical incentives for liquidity providers outside of distributing LP tokens. As it stands, one common problem with liquidity providers is that they routinely withdraw both their allocated resources and rewards once eligible or when a more competitive protocol with a higher APY comes around. This periodic and capitulated sale of a protocol’s native tokens on the market often causes a diluted supply.Scalability: DeFi platforms that experience high periods of network activity can often suffer from data congestion. These bottlenecks slow the speed of transactions and make network fees, like gas (in the case of Ethereum), increasingly expensive.Security: Given the highly technical nature of these systems, most DeFi users still don’t understand how to safely manage risk or objectively validate the security of a network as they stake (lock-up) large volumes of funds.Centralization: Consistent with the issues outlined by the blockchain trilemma, many DeFi platforms sacrifice decentralization to allow for higher levels of scalability and security.Oracles: Financial services that depend on external or off-chain information need a higher quality of third-party data sources (oracles) than what is currently available in web3.There are few good projects in DeFi 2.0 sector.Like I recently discovered Trava Finance with token ( $TRAVA ) and Tradao ( $ TOD) both are very good .But do your own research.Check websites for more details:$TRAVAThe next generation of Lending Protocols$TODTRADAO - The world's first Bonding Protocol with Installment and Reputation Tracking","1,772 followers",Thomas Y Graham,639,55,4.5M,2022,https://www.quora.com/Why-do-investors-still-choose-Bitcoin-to-invest-their-money-even-though-altcoins-are-more-advanced-technologically-and-perform-much-better
