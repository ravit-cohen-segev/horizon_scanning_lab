Computer repair? You can learn that, yes. But then you have to start a business and it needs at least a year until you have enough clients to live from that.You can learn to work with the Raspberry Pi, check out Lua as a language, very fast to learn, an afternoon:With this you can do two things: you can offer courses for kids to get them into computing or you can start to write little cheap games for Android with that, that you just sell over Google Store. You won’t get rich by that, but with a couple of little games you add, the typical Christmas thingy and such crap you have at the end of the year enough money for your $500 goal.And it will go on for years, when you started that. Steady income.The schooling for kids is a bit more permanent work (not that you can stop making little games in Lua), but that’s a bit harder, but the goal is set higher; you are building a better world for the next generation and give them a good start.There are projects out there, but far too few and schools totally fail this task. So that would be good money, too and it would be fun for you, working with kids.But don’t do websites. Man. Don’t do that. You will have a lot of trouble with stupid clients, “no, that is not EXACTLY the corn blue that we requested, you don’t get the money until you deliver the final fix!” But they don’t give you the correct color code either. Many of them will find any minor detail not perfect enough to be willing to pay you and this is just a giant pool of bullshit where you are going to bath in. And where you will slave away for <$5 an hour in the end.Even a job as a cashier at the next supermarket is better than that. So don’t do webdesign. Really. That’s slave-work and nobody should do that. I have been there as part of a bigger job. Just terrible.Game companies are always looking for interns. A lot of young females running around and good mood and fun work, you will do real hard work, because they will slave you out for your intern price and then fire you. But, hey. A lot of females and with that a bit of biological fun. If you like the artsy kind of girl. I’m more in that geekish computer-nerd mathematical hyper cynical one, to be honest. Or that boing-boing-boing let’s doing something new kind of tomboy.But you will be working for minimum wage in the gaming industry. Maybe to start your own series of little games is better.And you can always write bots (in Lua no problem) and gold-farm any kind of crappy games out there. That’s going quickly over that $500, but they will cut your accounts and give you a lot of shit for that and that. So to write your own games is better than to exploit stupid games out there. But a bit more work and you need some ideas.And there is always “Clickwork” available. Writing some little articles, translating stuff that has been badly translated from Chinese or some Eastern European country. $15–25 an hour. This is stuff that you can always do, most demand you to work at least 20h/week.",6 followers,Ian Williams,1.9K,2.7K,38M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-is-going-to-be-the-next-innovation-in-internet-technology

4,"When I first wrote a novel in 1991 I remember walking down the road and seeing a pretty girl and thinking, “She might like me now”.I know that a lot of what I write seems to involve whether or not women like me.I also wanted money. I didn’t want to work for a boss. That scary feeling of being called into the boss’s office after you know you did something that was “wrong”.When I first wrote a novel in 1991 I remember walking down the road and seeing a pretty girl and thinking, “She might like me now”.I know that a lot of what I write seems to involve whether or not women like me.I also wanted money. I didn’t want to work for a boss. That scary feeling of being called into the boss’s office after you know you did something that was “wrong”.Note: the above sentence is what I would whisper to myself after being summoned to the boss’s office.“Don’t you have any pride in your work?”Whatever. It’s because I was busy and no I didn’t have pride in my work.I was 22 years old and looking at women and trying to publish a novel on the side so I didn’t have to work anymore. And I have no comment about the sandwiches.But the rules changed every 3 or 4 years and they will change again. Just like they change with everything in life.By the way, that first novel, and the four that came after it, and the 50 short stories that came after it, never got published.I used to think I needed to publish something before I could feel good about myself, before I could call myself a “writer”, before I could have a girlfriend, before I could get a real job, before I could move to NYC.What a pathetic weight on my shoulder to think I needed something controlled by just a handful of people. Those weights stayed on my back for years.When you have weights on you, you can’t move. The weights are only mental. Go ahead. Move.So…GO!A)B)I try to read at the level I want to write. I do this in the morning before I start writing. If you email me, you can see in the auto response some of the latest things I’ve been reading.At night I relax and read things that are a little more like “junk food” – fun things that I want to read but don’t necessarily inspire my writing. If you don’t like reading, you won’t like writing.Before I wrote this morning, I read parts of books from Teju Cole, Bukowski, Eckhart Tolle, and the blog Hyperbole and a Half.Someone wrote in a comment to someone else’s post a few weeks ago: What if James Altucher had to take care of two kids in the morning?Yes, it’s true. Kids suck. But sometimes I do have to do that. Plus I have other responsibilities. So I wake up at 4am and begin reading and writing. Or earlier. Whatever it takes.C)And they take a year to publish your book after they accept your book. This is not 100% true. But try to gauge the entrepreneurship of the people you are dealing with. You need people as creative as you. It needs to be a team and not a machine.You can traditionally publish, but make sure you are doing it with creative entrepreneurs (cc Patricia Gift ) and not people stuck in the machine.If you think you need a mainstream publisher for reasons of ego or prejudice then you are guaranteed to publish a worst-seller instead of a bestseller.The second you start to think something, anything, is IMPORTANT, then your ego will suffer and your work will suffer.If you are an artist, get your art in the hands of people. That’s your only job. Destroy every gatekeeper.I have over 20 t-shirts with the entire 67,000 words of “Choose Yourself!” printed on it. My kids have several shirts. Claudia does. Nobody is allowed to walk into this house without wearing that t-shirt.Do what you want. Self-publishing simply means you write a book and you figure out how to get it into the hands of other people. It might just be you sell it on your email list. Congrats! You’re then a published author.In my post, “How to Self Publish a Bestseller” I write about the details and the numbers.I get it. I love bookstores also. It’s like a work of art to see all of those covers, to thumb through the pages, to grab a pile of books and a coffee and start seeing what books you want to buy.But don’t forget just 20 years ago everyone said Barnes & Noble was evil because they were killing the independent bookstore.I have news for you: the indies were evil also. One guy picking out 500 of his favorite books and no others.Now a B&N might have 10,000 books but Amazon has 20 million books. Why would you ever give someone the choice to limit you. I hope all bookstores die and that Amazon is the only one left standing. Because then every author has a chance and not just the ones the B&N gatekeeper decides on.And I’ll tell you how I am doing my role: I pick out the books I might buy in a Barnes & Noble. I take them to the coffee shop in the store. I buy my coffee and start thumbing through the books.Then I buy the books right there and then in the store.On my Kindle.Screw you, Barnes & Noble.F)But your free audience is not the way to do it. They read your blog for free. They don’t even want to fork over 99 cents to buy your book.I will give you an example: on my last book, “Choose Yourself!” I obviously encouraged my readers to buy it. But another group, Stansberry Research, recommended it to their paying subscribers.In two weeks through them I sold tens of thousands of books. It took my free audience, which was millions bigger, three months to catch up in sales to an audience that had never even heard of me before.Now my book has sold over 100,000 copies and I’m getting ready to send out another email bundle to another list. This will be infinitely more valuable than any blog, podcast, marketing, whatever I use to promote my book on the Internet.Most of the Internet is “outrage porn” and I’m glad we’ve avoided that.One rule I have is I am loyal for life to anyone who helps me make money and Ryan definitely helped me.G)But if you want to blog, don’t just register a domain name and start blogging. You won’t get any traffic.I encourage people to find online communities that they like and feel like participating in and start blogging there or guest posting there.If you are unsure of where and how to blog, start by practicing on a site like Quora, which is a question and answer site that also hosts blogs.Practice answering questions there. See what gets upvoted and what doesn’t. Improve your skills. See if you enjoy it. Then start taking some of your answers and making them into a blog. Then start guest posting on other sites.You’re not trying to build an audience for your blog. You’re trying to build an audience for YOU, PERIOD. There’s no money in ads, blah.You have to be more creative than ever how you build an audience. The best Internet marketing I did was when I did a reddit AMA (which Ryan, above, set up).And millionaire teenage bestseller, Amanda Hocking, was posting in the comments section of JA Konrath’s site and building community that way.There’s a thousand ways to build community and practice writing on the Internet. Blog is one of them but there are many others. My #1 suggestion: first practice on Quora (cc Marc Bodnick) If you go there, follow me and say “Hi!”.H)I have another friend who has been working for 30 years on one novel. She keeps hating it and rewriting it. She can’t get a publisher interested. She only writes when she’s inspired. She needs writing groups to push her along.I get it. I get writer’s block also. But writing is a muscle. I used to play in chess tournaments a lot. I was ranked a master. And then I got busy with other things. So my skill level has dropped. It would take me a good SIX MONTHS OF STUDYING three hours a day to just get back up to my old skill level.If you don’t write every day, you won’t know what your potential skill level is. You will be producing sub-par work. And in a world where 15 million books will be published this year, your book will have little chance to shine.It doesn’t matter if you write good stuff or bad stuff every day. Yesterday, for fun, I wrote about how much I enjoyed bowel movements. Will I publish that? I hope not! It was awful! But I wrote because that’s what I wrote yesterday. 1500 words about bowel movements. Mission accomplished.Do the math, if you just write 1000 words a day that are publishable then you have a book every two months. 1000 words a day is not easy. But it’s not hard either. This post is 1800 words so far and I started 20 minutes ago. I’ll spend many more hours rewriting it than writing it but once you start exercising the writing muscle (start with 200 words a day, then 300, etc) you will get up to 1000.When Claudia Azula Altucher and I went away on a silent retreat to write “The Power of No”, which hasn’t come out yet, we were writing about 7,000 words a day.Sometimes more words is not better. If I write a 1000 words, then by the time I’ve published I’ve usually rewritten and edited it down to 600 words.I)First you have a block of stone, then you make a sculpture, then you chisel and fine tune until you have a work of art. Art is born from the rewrite, not from the typewrite.With “Choose Yourself!” I kept rewriting obsessively.One time the book was all finished and sent to editors, designers, etc. Then I did the audio version. KABLAMO!Any paragraph that made me feel like, “Ugh, I’m too bored to read this out loud,” I noted. Then I went back home and rewrote the whole book again. And the audio version veered so much from the book it was completely unabridged. Everyone hated me. But I liked the final result much beter. Read your work out loud and cut out anything that makes you lag.J)But those days are over. People just don’t pay for content. And there are too many writers. It’s a supply and demand thing. If you expect to make a living from articles or blogs then figure out how to do one of three things:blog for free, but then lead people to a subscription information product. Like “stock picks” or “dating” or whatever you think you’re an expert at and nobody else is. (cc Ramit Sethi Lewis Howes Tim Sykes Derek Halpern Porter Stansberry etc)I’ve never been that great at any of the three above. Well, maybe #3 but only recently.So this leaves us with only one thing. ONE THING works.For everyone else, you have to write more than one book. And for most people, you have to write dozens of books.I was at a dinner recently of a bunch of self-published Amazon authors who were making a living at it. Every single one of them had more than ten books written and published in the prior year or so.+Theresa Ragan, as an example, has 13 or 14 books written (thriller and romance) in the past 2 or 3 years.Hugh Howey, known for his Wool series, has written around 28 books in the past few years. I lost count while counting them. He never stops. I highly recommend his SAND series which just came out.At the dinner there was one woman who had written over 100 books. If she averages $100 a book a month for the rest of her life it’s not so bad. “Choose Yourself!” was my 11th or 12th published book. I have four more books sitting here ready to go.Throughout history the best books have often been written in a short amount of time. Bukowski’s “Post Office” and Jack Kerouac’s “On the Road” were both written in three weeks. I can find 1000 more examples.Sean Platt has a good book that just came out about writing many books. I recommend it. “Write. Publish. Repeat.” I think Sean has published over 50 books. I don’t know because he uses pseudonyms as well.Always remember the key rule: an overnight success takes at least five years of solid work (as defined in my prior post “The Ultimate Cheat Sheet on Reinventing Yourself”).I left out important things: how do you market books, how do you make art, how do you build discipline, what do you write about, and so on. There’s answers for all of those.The most important thing for me: writing without fear. Writing without judgment. Writing without anger. Making writing fun. Writing right now.Writing is about freedom and not money.I want to write to you something fun and useful. And I want you to read it.",0 followers,Johnson McDonald,1.3K,52,134.1K,2014,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-skills-in-the-field-of-technology-that-can-be-learnt-in-the-next-6-months-and-which-would-help-me-to-earn-money-on-the-side

7,"The only way you can earn more money is by increasing the value (or perceived value) that you bring to the marketplace.Period.Everything that you do to earn more money will abide by this rule.If you negotiate a raise, you earn that raise because you helped your boss realize the value that you’re bringing to the company.If you sell more products it’s because you increased the value of those products or leveraged smart marketing tactics to increase the perceived value of those products.Anything and everything that you do to increase your money must start from a place of increasing your value toThe only way you can earn more money is by increasing the value (or perceived value) that you bring to the marketplace.Period.Everything that you do to earn more money will abide by this rule.If you negotiate a raise, you earn that raise because you helped your boss realize the value that you’re bringing to the company.If you sell more products it’s because you increased the value of those products or leveraged smart marketing tactics to increase the perceived value of those products.Anything and everything that you do to increase your money must start from a place of increasing your value to the marketplace.So how do you actually go about doing this?While there are 1,000,000 and 1 ways you can become more valuable, these are the 3 best that I’ve found after building a 7-figure business.Enjoy.1. Increase Your Productivity (The Speed with Which You Provide Value)The first way that you can earn more money is by increasing your ability to get sh*t done and provide value at a faster speed.Think about it this way…Imagine there are two people who are equally skilled at their job as creative writers.The first writer can write 1,000 words in 60 minutes.The second writer can write 2,500 words in 60 minutes.Who do you think will be more highly paid? Who do you think will get promoted?Obviously, the writer who can get twice as much work done in the same amount of time (this is especially true if you’re a freelancer or entrepreneur).Therefore, one of the best ways to get paid more is to increase your output by leveraging proven productivity tactics.I’ve written extensively about productivity here on Quora I’ll summarize my best points here:Implementing the above tips can help you increase your productivity by 50% or more.And once you are able to get more done in less time than your competitors or coworkers, you WILL start making more money.2. Increase Your Skills (The Level of Value You Bring)Once you are able to get more done in less time, you’ll want to find ways that you can get more done while simultaneously increasing the quality of the work that you’re accomplishing.To do this, you will need to adhere to three simple principles.When you commit to the process, educate yourself massively on your chosen field, and hire coaches to help you identify and eliminate your weaknesses, you will quickly rise to the top of your field and be able to demand any price that you want.3. Increase Your Status (The Perceived Value of Working with You)Have you ever watched Dr. Phil?He’s a marriage counselor, author, and TV personality with an estimated networth of about $400 million.An hour of counseling with Dr. Phil will run you… Oh, just a measly $40,000!Now let me ask you a question…The average marriage counselor charges between $75 and $150 an hour.That’s less than 10% of what it would cost you to work with Dr. Phil.But do you really think that Dr. Phil is 400x better than other marriage counselors?OF COURSE NOT!He might be good, but I promise he’s not that good.So how can he charge such an outrageous price?Simple… Because he’s increased his perceived status. (or value).And if you want to make more money, you must do the same thing.People want to work with high status people.Period.If you can increase your status by becoming a best selling author, driving a nicer car (e.g. Tai Lopez), setting public speaking engagements, and becoming a prolific creator on all major channels, then you can charge pretty much whatever you want.Not because you’re better than everyone else.But because the general publicYou can start small here.Upgrade your wardrobe, create more content and get it published on major blogs, write a book on Amazon, do small things that make you seem more high status.Eventually, you will reach a point where you never have to look for money again and you’ll have more business and opportunities than you know what to do with falling right into your lap.Hope this helpsStay Grounded,Want my best stuff on quora?Click here","7,448 followers",Liya Sah,15K,0,0,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-skills-in-the-field-of-technology-that-can-be-learnt-in-the-next-6-months-and-which-would-help-me-to-earn-money-on-the-side

If it was - I would keep doing it...So let's say,  you buy an item for $5 , you sell it for $10 -- you make $5. Right ?So you are basically making 10% profitThus I have left that biz model... but it taught me a lot about online sales - choosing right products - dealing with Chinese vendors - shipping issue - customer service - Social media - marketing etc.It was interesting and I'm glad I learnt all that - but what I learnt the MOST is that the one that makes the REAL money here for the LEAST work is AMAZON !LAST ADVICE to everyone who think about that path : whatever you do - don't pay someone to teach you how to make money online - don't join groups where you pay membership - don't join ""tribes"" or whatever nonsense they are trying to sell you... it's all B.S. !You don't need anyoneI personally think it'sThe only real way to make money on Amazon is to find those TRENDY items before everyone else and start selling them in HIGH margins when it's super hot... then you make money for a short while - but it's BIG money.When everyone else jumps on that wagon - you let it go... and find your NEXT HIT product... that's really the ONLY way to make money that is worth your time... but it requires really good skills to predict those things , fast action , a lot of funds for inventory (as it can run out quickly from your supplier as it did for me... ) & a bit of a RISK... as you never really know if it will catch...I hope that helps.

We think of it as providing a physical force that creates the hard surface contact; but how does it create the physical being of the character? In Star-Trek is literally creates a life like person in front of you with real organs and a voice. One would interprate this as a device creating actual life.

PD/PDL-1 blockers like Opdivo, Keytruda, Tecentric, etc seem to be effective in a wide variety of metastatic cancers (though so far only curative in melanoma, as far as I know). CAR-T cell therapy, where they extract the patient’s own immune cells and genetically engineer them to attack the cancer, sounds very promising too.In summary, the problem is not a lack of breakthroughs, but a huge variety of targets to attack. It’s also worth mentioning that new cancer treatments are outrageously expensive. I read that one single infusion of the drug used for CAR-T therapy is $475,000. At this rate, the health system will go bankrupt soon. The major breakthrough that desperately needs to occur is a shift in consciousness toward focusing efforts in PREVENTION of cancer.

No single onslaught is likely to destroy the enemy but the relentless combination probably will.For cancer, your enemy is growing exponentially and the challenge is to find a collection of destructive agents, each of which moves that growth exponent toward zero and then into negative territory. Even slightlyThis is as good a place as any to present my “Trench Warfare Theory of Curing Cancer”.In trench warfare, the strategy is to continuously hit the enemy with wave upon wave of deadly agents:Small arms sniper fire, plus poison gas, plus flame throwers, plus tank treads, plus…You get the idea. No single onslaught is likely to destroy the enemy but the relentless combination probably will.For cancer, your enemy is growing exponentially and the challenge is to find a collection of destructive agents, each of which moves that growth exponent toward zero and then into negative territory. Even slightly negative population growth means you win eventually.The thing about this approach is, if it works, you will never figure out exactly why. Call it the fog of trench cancer war. For this reason it will not be considered a cure, and indeed it won’t be. It is however a viable general approach to dealing with cancer. The idea is to assemble a list of putative anticancer agents with very good safety profiles and add them one by one. If a particular agent causes side effects toss it out.The practical limit of this approach is how many agents you can try at one time. If you have a marker for how you are doing that’s huge because then you can add and subtract agents from the mix. Otherwise you are flying blind and have to wait for gross anatomical updates, PET scans etc.There’s no money in this approach because combination therapies of this complexity are hopeless to patent and the constituent agents are largely public domain. The approach is intrinsically impenetrably opaque. With time and experience a data base should emerge of cocktails that worked. I can offer three case studies right now.A. IP6- phosphoinositol-6. According to the literature it is the metabolic intermediate IP5 that is a potent anti cancer agent.B. Modified Pectin. This acts as a putative anti metastatic agent.C. Modified curcumin. This is a complex of two demethoxy curcumin sharing a sodium at the enol groups. The complex is highly water soluble. Here is the recipe:2 kg glycerol, 1 kg curcumin 95, 500g sodium carbonate. This is a slight excess of curcumin powder, and excess of sodium carbonate powder. This ensures full reaction as excess unreacted material will settle to the bottom of the pot when stirring is stopped.Combine by mixing and add into a double boiler. For example a three quart sauce pan placed inside a large fry pan containing one inch of water works well. Stir periodically with gentle boiling of the water in the outer pan. Cook for one hour. Using a syringe, load the hot black goo mixture into size 00 enteric gel caps from capsuline company. The enteric caps protect the complex from being destroyed in the stomach acid. This is important.A similar method without the double boiler can be used to react resveratrol at about 130 degrees C. A candy makers thermometer works well to limit temperature. Strong mixing is required and some smoking of the material will occur. The same 4:2:1 ratios are used.I don’t know the dosage the boy took but it was subject to what he could tolerate.This worked quite well. The boy’s tumors shrank and he was able to finish with surgery.Case study 2.A 60 year old woman with stage 4 lung cancer.IP6 two heaping teaspoons daily.Modified pectin. Two heaping teaspoons daily.Modified curcumin ten 00 caps daily.Modified Resveratrol ten 00 caps daily(same recipe as curcumin but 130 C temp so no double boiler.)Ethanol nightly as a co solvent to aid bioavailability. Three standard drinks.Standard chemo. Cisplatin.Current status: in remission. Maintenance all the above plus a kinase inhibitor.Third case study:A 72 year old woman with multiple myeloma.Modified curcuminModified resveratrolIP6MM is considered incurable. Multiple chemo agents are tried in sequence with expectation tumors will grow back. There is a marker with high precision so you can watch the exponential marker rebound from each chemo. The cocktail here greatly extended the time between rebound.This matters because once you run out of new chemo agents to try you are done.Below is a document posted by the husband of the multiple myeloma woman. It is a good review of his experience making and using the modified curcumin material.REPORTThe Plan​1Drug Selection​1Delivery​3Results​4DisclaimerAny report such as this which contains the data collected , activities carried out , decisions taken and tests performed over the last 4 years is certain to contain errors.

How to actually deliver these drugs to the sites and cells they need to effect. Issues of solubility , degradation and permeability dominate the problem. I decided oral administration was the first method to investigate. We should all be very wary of the word ""dissolved"". Unless we mean obtaining an amorphous state (spatially separated molecules) then I am not sure it has meaning. Even the best SNEDD technology only talks about delivering 30mg of drug in a 1g oil package i.e. 3% active ingredient. You can ""mix"" a lot of stuff with oils but they are not dissolved.I also decided that I had 3 routes to try:1. Purchase and take the most concentrated extract I could find.2. Transform that extract to a solid dispersion for delivery3. Transform that extract to a Self Nano Emulsifying delivery systemResultsThis graph covers the charting of lambda FLCs from mid 2016; where the following has been concluded:1 The aggressive relapse (in red) was treated with ""as purchased"" drugs in increasing doses. Dose increase made insignificant changes to the relapse equation and by the end of 2016 it was clear that conventional chemo would be required. Bortezomib was used ( in blue) and began to restore the situation; but had to be suspended becaause of lung problems.2. The relapse continued and I started using the SD drug formulations (green). There is a noticeable slowing of the relapse curve which would have been predicted for unmodified drugs. I concluded that curcumin can and does ""help"" but either needs greater concentration or synergistic assistance. However by the end of 2017 it was again clear that SD formulation would not be adequate to restore remission.I started working on SNEDD technology. Making various emulsions and buying a small Atomic Force Microscope so as to be able to be certain that the emulsion droplets were below 100nm in size (ultra-sonic stirring is required) to effect intestinal absorption. At that stage and before the SNEDD technology was ready for implementation I found another web site and this is what I would urge you to study. For me it was a ""game changer"".Curcumin recipe for cancer absorbtion brad culkinThe first two points on the final (blue/yellow curve) were using this technology only with curcumin. Again a very significant slowing of the relapse rate - but not quite adequate. The last point , from blood tests done last week are for me the ""game changer"". Within the limits of accuracy of the FLC tests the light chains have NOT gone up during that 4 week period in an environment of very high disease burden. This was achieved using Brad's technology with both curcumin and resveratrol, as a result of many reported synergistic behaviours between them (2.5 g of each were used daily).Brad's site is not up-to-date but the basic principles still remain. We have changed the formulation to a ratio of 4:2:1 by mass of glycerol:drug:carbonate. Brad and I have made and tested it with curcumin and resveratrol and I have just tried making it with parthenolide; whilst Brad has made but not tried silibinin.The curcumin for instance changes from a light yellow powder plus a clear liquid into a black tar. When that ""tar"" is placed in the dissolving is rapid and the solution density is very high and the stability is good in water, the resulting solutions having a pH=10 when 1g of ""tar"" is dissolved in 20ml of DD water.The laser penetration into 0.2g of curcumin (1g of ""tar"") dissolved into 20ml DD water is negligible in the deep red solution.Neither of us know the detail of the chemistry that is taking place , but it is profound and renders all the drugs tested so far easily and rapidly soluble in water and stable at low alkaline pH i.e. intestinal. How Brad ever came to even consider such an unlikely formulation beggars my belief; but he did. We are trying to find somebody who can analyse it. Clearly it must be taken in enteric capsules. We have both constructed automated capsule filling machines.Whether the addition of parthenolide will ""do the trick"" for me is still an open question. But this is the first time for years that I have felt a real optimism that Linda and I will ""get there"". The feverfew extract I bought gave me a lot of problems which is why it has not yet been used. Its water solubility is poor , the extract I had did not dissolve well in alcohol or acetone; hence making SD formulations was abandoned - in retrospect maybe a big mistake.However that is all now ""water under the bridge"" and we move on with Brad's chemistry.Brad and I are in continued contact swapping notes about chemistry , cancers and stroke recovery. I intend to explore resveratrol for rejuvenation when (not if) the myeloma problem can be stabilised.NB The curcumin and resveratrol are not the only aspects of the above treatment regime - they are most certainly the most novel. Inositrols , vitamins (D3 and K2) and alcohol form the additional ingredients that Linda was taking.This is the data data showing a deflection of the light chain marker from its normal exponential relapse behavior. The improvement is remarkable especially considering the inhibiting agents can be taken indefinitely without side effects.","220,551 followers",Franklin Veaux,1.3K,47.3K,782.4M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-skills-in-the-field-of-technology-that-can-be-learnt-in-the-next-6-months-and-which-would-help-me-to-earn-money-on-the-side

Prior to this all medicine could do was cut it out and hope it had not spread since the imaging was so poor compared to today. this is why people thought that the air getting to the cancer caused it to spread. A doctor would operate and find that the cancer had already spread no matter what he did. The patient would later die. They were going to die with or without the surgery. Later radiation was added. In the last 50 years, the early diagnostics have improved. Screening stool for blood. the imaging has improved. Mammograms, CT scans, MRI scans PET scans etc. The surgery, anesthetic and reconstructive techniques have been created. New ways to radiate have been added to the regimens. Doctors have gotten together and kept records and done prospective and retrospective studies to see what works in what combinations. The chemotherapy drugs have become more effective with less side effects for many. Lastly immunotherapy to tag the cancers and check point inhibitors to turn off the reason the cancer is not detected by the body as foreign are being used more and more frequently. They are very expensive.Note that the Gardasil vaccine for human papilloma virus may cut the number of cervix cancers in women significantly. We are currently having an increase in throat cancer due to the virus but it may also decrease if we can get everyone vaccinated. It will take a generation or 2 to make this happen.So we do not have cures for many things. But we are getting closer and closer. The best we can do is decrease our risks by avoiding things like cigarettes and early detection by exam or tests such as the breast exams, pelvic and cervical exams, Testicle exams, check for blood in the urine, colonoscopy for everyone at some time in their lives depending on problems and family history.",0 followers,Gary Larson,796,872,29.1M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-skills-in-the-field-of-technology-that-can-be-learnt-in-the-next-6-months-and-which-would-help-me-to-earn-money-on-the-side
