It wasn’t really a thing and it remains a bit of a mystery to most people as to why using an idea someone else had is so terrible. IP protection works well in an ultra capitalist ultra materialist society like the US but in China it just hampers the advancement and spread of new tech and limits growth.Protection of IP is good for personal wealth but not so good for the advancement of society.","46,100 followers",Steven Haddock,1.2K,25.6K,343.3M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-will-be-the-future-of-Intellectual-Property-that-is-IPR-in-next-decade-of-Indias-technology-sector

I have been active in this field for the last 30 years and wish I had another 30 in me with the rate that things are moving right now. If you take the following assumptions it could go a lot further.If those all play out then I think we will see a continued advancement with O.I. Prosthetics, (Osseo-Integrated Prosthetics) This is where they actually attach the prosthesis through the actual bone with an anchor surgically implanted with one to three surgeries. I have personally seen it to success and it is phenomenal but expensive and a little out of our healthcare bubble in the US at least for the next 10 years or so.For those that are looking for components and sockets there's still plenty of runway available. We are seeing adjustable sockets for above knee amputees that are crazy comfortable and fully patient adjustable like the VAROS socket from Ottobock. We have successfully fit over 20 of these to date. I would only assume that in the next 50 years they will become more implantable, possible microprocessor controlled for temp, fit, dynamic function etc.As far as technology in components we are seeing continued advancements in microprocessor feet, knees and upper limb. The sky is the limit, especially in upper. I would envision a hand that can play the piano and guitar all controlled directly from the brain through TMR type surgeries which are happening today.Lots to talk about, “but overall very cool things for amputees” is the best answer.","246,825 followers",Dushka Zapata,2.9K,8.5K,232.3M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Looking-at-the-current-state-of-technology-trends-etc-what-are-some-cool-budget-ideas-to-start-next-year-and-what-are-the-best-businesses-to-start-in-2015

Several biological possibilities look promising:On the non-biological front, it seems likely that nanotech will by 2066 have developed microscopic machines that can traverse one’s bloodstream searching for abnormal cells. Once identified, such intelligent nanites could selectively snip and kill such cells or potentially even repair them.The most speculative idea is that we may be able to upload a “person” into a computer as software. Bizarre as this sounds, the logic behind it is this:Kurzweil has advanced a kind of “camel’s nose under the tent” argument for why this will be feasible. Today, no one thinks a person with a cochlear implant is a machine, yet a machine is part of such a person. In the next 50 years, this kind of “cyborg” replacement of failing organs can be expected to accelerate and include most if not all organs. (Big caveat: if one’s stem cells can be used to grow replacement organs, as is anticipated, those will likely be preferred to mechanical replacements, unless one wants “superhuman” abilities—to hear like a cat, or to see like an eagle, for example.)By Kurzweil’s logic, the gradual replacement of a person’s biological systems with mechanical systems will eventually result in a machine that will likelyOf course, such mechanical replacement arguments presume the “person” to be an emergent property of certain patterns of information, and not something different and strange.

We’re less than 20 years into hardware based digital formats - mp3s had about 10 and now we’re into streaming. Some people think streaming is an ultimate format and they may be right but streaming itself will continue to evolve significantly in ways we can’t predict.Here are some easier to predict concepts that are really just continuations of where we are now:Talent: I think we’ll continue to see more and more talent come to the forefront that is better and better (and maybe younger). Globalization means everyone has access to all talent - when i was growing up learning to play bass I was a GOOD bass player for my small town in NJ. I had to go to a summer program at Berklee to learn that I had a long way to go and keep practicing. That competition exists on YouTube now. The downside of that is I can also learn anything to become ‘minimally adequate’ quickly because all information is available at all times, but I think we’ll continue to see better and better instrumentalists pushing boundaries.Style: We’ll see more and more individual and smaller group music. This is already happening - bands are removing band members in favor of tracks and this is going to continue. As more people can create professional quality in their bedrooms they’re going to venture out to collaborate less - smaller and smaller groups and more solo artists - that will mean more influence of electronics.Distribution: As physical distribution matters less and less and digital distribution gets cheaper there will be more and more opportunities to share music - SoundCloud and YouTube the modern example of totally free ubiquitous distribution. TuneCore, STEM and CD Baby allow for pro level. Distribution is available to everyone and everyone can deliver music globally, instantly for very little money. That will get cheaper and easier.Access: This is for all entertainment - thanks to Moore’s...",136 followers,Sakshi Mohapatra,6.1K,0,0,2021,https://www.quora.com/Looking-at-the-current-state-of-technology-trends-etc-what-are-some-cool-budget-ideas-to-start-next-year-and-what-are-the-best-businesses-to-start-in-2015
