It's expected that current projections predicting the market valuation will hit 80 Billion USD by 2025. Data centers are increasingly turning to solid-state storage options as they tackle the complex tasks presented by edge computing, IoT data analysis, deep learning, and next-generation tech.The future of SSDs is the zenith of innovations in its two critical components - NAND flash and the controller. NAND flash is the workhorse of an SSD that stores the actual data. It is made up of several nonvolatile memory blocks, which do not require power to store the data. The controller is the center of the operation, and It's an embedded processor that contains the firmware to manage the read and write tasks of the SSD.With V-NAND advancements, SSDs may be overtaking hard disks regarding how much data you can fit in a particular sized box. For a long time, SSDs had significantly less capacity than hard disks and made up for their increased performance.In the near term, you can expect higher capacity SSDs to become more prevalent. Technologies like V-NAND will continue to speed up market acceptance of higher SSD densities.The improvements in the technology will significantly increase SSD capacities in addition to their performance. The cost per gigabyte for SSDs is continuously decreasing compared to traditional hard drives as cost reduces, the adoption rate and market share for SSDs rise in the next decade.",4 followers,Stephen Kendall,776,273,1.6M,2021,https://www.quora.com/How-will-SSD-technology-improve-over-the-next-decade-or-so

In my opinion, China no longer care about being behind the wall and aim to play the Big Game (or how Kipling called it).Gradually, she has been building her sphere of influence through her Belt and Road initiative, taking over Africa, and more importantly, becoming the world producer number one.Unfortunately for her, the West has finally realized that something was not alright, so the West started to undertake steps to inhibit China's growing influence.Fortunately for China, Russia, her another global rival, is licking her wounds after the painful collapse of the Soviet Union, so Russia doesn't mind to join forces to defeat the West, especially after the EU declared its intention to stay in the same camp with the USA instead of creating the Eurasian alliance that Russia tried to form.So whoever tries to deny China her status of a world power must have serious issues with his or her cognitive abilities.I have no idea how China plans to play her cards, but I suspect the peace on this planet to end soon. The overpopulation with the scarcity of resources cannot but lead to competition, in which the local wars will run across the whole globe.And if the real world war ignites, we can only wonder if the dead were not the lucky.",18 followers,Asim Qureshi,12.7K,996,155.9M,2022,https://www.quora.com/How-will-SSD-technology-improve-over-the-next-decade-or-so

This is extremely important for their modernizations of their military- and it will further set them back.At this pointThis will not stop them to produce for example amphibious people movers. But it will slow down (or even stop) developments for high tech hypersonic missiles, combat jets, sensors and radars and so on.The whole Chinese property crisis will even more hinder R&D. Banks for the moment are failing - and China will have serious problems - that means, they cannot focus on their military, when the rest is failing (and their society becomes aggravated).And we also have to understand, that a certain degree of the information which comes from China is propaganda and bragging. For example I have seen a video, where the author pointed out, that China soon will have 5 aircraft carriers.But he didn’t mentioned, that the first one - is basically modernized rubbish (Russian origin). The 2nd one is also still based on Russian design - and have been a model, to get to the level of a reasonable effective platform. The speed of the production is also a big concern. At the end, they will be big boats, which are not at all effective.Especially effectiveness is a major point, which has to be worked out. People think, that modern weapon systems are difficult to produce, but when they are deployed, it is all good. This is not the case. Especially systems like aircraft carriers, submarines, even fighter jets, need to be consistently improved (especially if you don’t have 80+ years of experience). And people (maintenance, active soldiers, system engineers etc.) have to be also trained - doctrines have to be created and followed and so on.",469 followers,Daniel Cohort,11.9K,377,1.2M,2020,https://www.quora.com/With-the-advancement-in-China-s-technology-can-they-be-regarded-as-the-world-power-in-the-next-decade

However, the idea of engineers doing dev and ops is going to become more commonplaceA Little history lesson: Since the 70s, most companies would manage software projects using the waterfall method. Using waterfall, the project would be divided into differrent phases: Planning, Design, Implementation, Testing, Deployment, Maintanence. Also, there used to be differrent teams with differrent responsibilities: Generally, there would a Dev team who was responsible got Design and Implementation. QA team was responsible for Testing. Ops team was responsible for Deployment and Maintanence. If there were any defects found during Testing, Deployment and Maintanence, the Dev team was responsible for fixing those defects.One of the problem with this approach is that it bred the “Throw it over the wall mentality”. Dev would frequently throw half tested, buggy code over the wall to QA. This resulted in bugs leaking into production. When Ops found bugs during deployment and maintanence, the cost to fix the bug became highly inflated because of communication barriers between Ops and Dev.Eventually, companies started moving to Agile, which is a highly iterative way of managing software. Instead of seperate phases, the software delivery is broken up into smaller quicker deliveries. The company makes many small incremental changes, not few big changes.THis is where the idea of “DevOps” came in. One of the reasons why Ops was manually intensive was because Operation Engineers aren’t programmers. They are technical, and can usually do some programming, but they were usually not hired for their programming skills. They are hired for their skills in understanding how hardware works, and how it gets maintained and monitored. SO, companies started looking for DevOps engineers. There were Ops engineers who can do Dev. They could write code that could automate parts of the work that Ops does. This solves the problem of the Ops team getting overloaded. The DevOps engineers automate the deployments, and deployments happen at the touch of a button.However, this doesn’t solve the problem of the “throw it over the wall” mentality. There is nothing incentivizing the Dev team to reduce bugs in the code. The Dev team is incentivized to meet deadlines. Also, the communication between Dev and Ops is still costly, which means bugs found in production are costly to fixA lot of companies, especially the top tier companies have moved to a “You build it; You own it model” This is enabled with the growth of cloud technologies that provide Platform as a Service. The idea is that there is a cloud platform that can host any kind of application that the organization needs. This cloud platform is managed by an army of Operations ENgineers. We do not have 3 seperate teams involved in building of software application. There is 1 team that builds applications that run on the cloud platform. This team are responsible for everything from Planning to Maintanence. No more silos. They build it. they test it.. they own it. If the application goes down at 3 am, the team that built the application wakes up and fixes it.This means that is no more “throw it over the wall”. If the guy sitting next to you, doesn’t test the code that he has written, chances are you are going to wake up at 3AM when a bug surfaces. SO, the entire team is incentivized to write bug free code. ALso, the entire team of developers is also incentivized to automate deployments and maintenance. There is a truism in software: Programmers are lazy. You make programmers responsible for something, they will find a way to automate the heck out of it, so the programmers have to do minimum work. This works well for the company: WHen a programmer has to wake up at 3AM once because a server goes down or something, he is going to a) get the server up on day oneb) sleep on day 2 c) add some code that automatically brings the server up on day 3. Boom! Problem solvedTLDR; IMO, the idea of DevOps is going to spread to the point that the title “DevOps” will become redundant. Every developer will do Ops. Every developer will be DevOps. Eventually, people will start using the word DevOps. In 20 year, people will marvel at the idea that Ops Engineers were involved in deployment and maintenance of applications.",18 followers,Asim Qureshi,10.5K,996,155.9M,2019,https://www.quora.com/How-will-SSD-technology-improve-over-the-next-decade-or-so
