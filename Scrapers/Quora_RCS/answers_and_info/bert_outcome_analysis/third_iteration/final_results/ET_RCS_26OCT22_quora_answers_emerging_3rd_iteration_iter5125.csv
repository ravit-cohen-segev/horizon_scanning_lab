1,"No, technology will never replace all professions and will only create professions which are not practiced today. In fact, technology will only create more jobs with a greater amount of skill and education due to the fact that technology will replace all the menial labor jobs. Due to this, more of the workforce will work in higher-paying jobs with a much greater skill set and education. When machines do end up replacing most of these jobs, hundreds of millions of new jobs will be created in order to design, build, code and maintain these machines. For every job that machines take away at leastNo, technology will never replace all professions and will only create professions which are not practiced today.

3,"It’s reasonable to ask whether or not the teaching profession has actually yet engaged with modern technology; having some isn’t the same as engaging.From the beginning of tech’s introduction to public ed, teachers have engaged with a lot of proprietary software. It wasn’t designed well and didn’t reflect software conventions normally encountered “in the wild.” Admins had no technology experience to use in their vetting and were easily dazzled, but did not know how to ask necessary questions. Tech departments insisted teachers change their practices, rather than design systems that reflected aIt’s reasonable to ask whether or not the teaching profession has actually yet engaged with modern technology; having some isn’t the same as engaging.From the beginning of tech’s introduction to public ed, teachers have engaged with a lot of proprietary software. It wasn’t designed well and didn’t reflect software conventions normally encountered “in the wild.” Admins had no technology experience to use in their vetting and were easily dazzled, but did not know how to ask necessary questions. Tech departments insisted teachers change their practices, rather than design systems that reflected and supported their professional needs - exactly backwards from the role of a conventional tech department.Money was the primary decision maker. It had the effect of making school districts known as low-hanging fruit for lesser quality software companies and it led not only to very idiosyncratic software solutions, but also to a proprietary culture of use and understanding of what tech was about. The culture that has issued from this beginning is one in which, even now, common public software and apps are reduced to proprietary parameters of usage - modern tech is not being engaged with on real terms, but in a reduced and idiosyncratic manner that reflects inhouse culture.Add to this the fact that most administrators and teachers could still not:This all matters before we even begin to discuss the use of technology as a pedagogical tool, because it indicates a passive relationship to technology that is not just disconnected from the real world, but avoidant of it…and we teach who we are.",4 followers,Matthew Bates,602,9.8K,293.1M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Is-technology-replacing-teachers-in-our-kids-schools
4,"You asked, “The short answer is, “No, not really.” Notes are still being passed. Rumors are being spread. Maturation is still happening. Relationships are ebbing and flowing. Students are still being grossed out when they realize that Mom and Dad are doing it. Students are discovering sex and they are still believing that they are the first generation to discover it. Self-Appointed Top Dogs who have done nothing to prepare for anything beyond high school are flaming out as they realize that those around them have been accepted by schoolYou asked, “The short answer is, “No, not really.” Notes are still being passed.

Self-Appointed Top Dogs who have done nothing to prepare for anything beyond high school are flaming out as they realize that those around them have been accepted by schools and they haven’t even applied anywhere and the list could go on and on.OrPerhaps you are asking how modern technologies have changed the learning experience. And that has not changed much either. There is still the “Learn It” phase and then the “Apply It” phase. Today, students get to see a great deal more and there is less “Application” and that’s not a good thing.I am Allen Morris and I approve of this dashed off first draft complete with all of its errors and typos.","246,853 followers",Dushka Zapata,1.5K,8.5K,232.5M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Can-technology-eventually-replace-all-professions
