As Bob Dylan said, “You’ll have to serve somebody. It may be the devil, it may be the Lord—but you’ll have to serve somebody…”The alien visitors intervening in our world long ago diverged from their spiritual core to follow a technological path. They still have Knowledge—the inner-knowing that is our connection to God—but they have no connection to it at this point. It is Knowledge that is the source of our greatest strength and courage and the only hope that humanity has to resist the take over of our world by this Intervention. As we become more invested in technology as the answer we lose our foundation in Knowledge.There is a New Message from God in the world which provides a preparation to reclaim our connection to Knowledge. It is given to us because our Creator will not give up on us. There are very few worlds where the race has maintained their freedom to be able to practice their connection to Knowledge. We are one of them. This is important not only for us but for other worlds that are free and maintain their spiritual core. We are a support for them as well.Humanity is at a crossroad between valuing and following their spiritual core or choosing the other path of technology. If this is the case, little by little the valuing of the spiritual falls away.Life in the Universe - Marshall Vian Summers“Generally speaking, if nations become technologically advanced, they become entirely secular in nature and will rarely have active, vital religious traditions. This is because the emphasis on technology and resources becomes so predominating and such a source of wealth and control that it overwhelms whatever other notions of power and authority that the native peoples might have had. As a result, over time, the reality and the existence of religion as you know it becomes very rare and is only practiced by small groups, often under clandestine conditions. Therefore, you should never assume that technological advancement promotes ethical or spiritual advancement, for in most cases it is the opposite that actually transpires.Great technological powers in your region rarely allow any individual freedom amongst their peoples. They function with great uniformity. Their citizens are expected to conform to very strict patterns of behavior to maintain this emphasis on stability and security. This emphasis has very unfortunate outcomes here for races that have lost their spiritual foundation and that have lost the emphasis on individual freedom and creativity.”","5,990 followers",Jens Böttiger,566,2.6K,17.6M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-advanced-technology-from-science-fiction-books-and-movies-will-probably-never-become-a-reality-and-why

Such a thing would have such a tremendous impact, we don't know the full consequences yet. Many people are completely open-minded about the future situation.

Just about everything I research on the subject is only talking about the upsides of such innovation. Everything has a price, and is this a deal we're willing to make?Of late, I've been researching all I can about future technology, and I'm completely unsatisfied with the notion that technology will solve our problems. It won't solve our problems—it's steadily making them worse. What was the cost of the current modern world? Nuclear war, global warming, and a perversion of our culture.The debt will only increase, and as we continue to reap the benefits from technology and congratulating ourselves on our ingenuity, we will become hopelessly addicted and enslaved to its magnetic screen. I'm not discounting that it's already happening, and we are in the beginning stages of it. The consequences will only become more severe, and we may have to abandon the Earth because even Mars looks more promising than a war-torn planet.Right now, it's easy to see an idyllic future, as humans are optimistic by nature. Our capitalistic system makes it seem that 'new' equals 'better' when this isn't necessarily the case. Products made in earlier generations lasted longer for one. My cheaply made desk collapsed within two years of purchasing, while my current desk was manufactured in the 19th century, and it serves me well. Are things that are made with machines necessarily better?The increase in interest toward STEM showcases this point. In humanities, we're hopelessly out of ideas, and we've all but given up on the cultural aspect of society, opting instead for a universal, bland culture. Politics is almost sickening, and we've already tried every political system possible—what's the point? You know we're a sick society when a Montana leader body-slams a reporter and he managed to win. STEM is practical, while the humanities are so controversial, if you say anything remotely original, you're a bigot, and get the hell off of my screen. Something like math is the most uncontroversial way you can be smart, because with math, there is either a right or wrong. Humanities? Open to interpretation and unique to its population.With STEM, I've noticed a stigma with ideas that don't align with the perfect future agenda. Whenever people warn about something that isn't mainstream, people ignore their warnings and continue to innovate as if nothing bad will become of it.Eventually, this illusion will fade when we're confronted with the issue. AI has been nicknamed the last invention, which may become all too true. People neglect that pesky detail, and they only focus on the positives, making it seem like we'll invent our way to a utopia.Technology has disastrous consequences, and we're running into a brick wall with our eyes shut. When we crash is the question, and how much will we be hurt? Will we be merely dazed or will it stupefy us? If we are successfully knocked unconscious, AI could either nurse us back to health, or do unspeakable things while we’re vulnerable? With the previous blunders by the human race, at least we knew that another person would either help or hurt us, not something as foreign, emotionless, and super intelligent as a computer. For the first time in eons, another thing could replace us on the food chain. We would no longer be the most intelligent beings on The Earth.So no, we're a few Jenga blocks away from tumbling our society. What happens when we reach a singularity is as mysterious as what caused The Big Bang. We can only speculate until that day arrives, sooner than most people can fathom.","246,826 followers",Dushka Zapata,1.5K,8.5K,232.3M,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-advanced-technology-from-science-fiction-books-and-movies-will-probably-never-become-a-reality-and-why

It is accretive and informs how I make the images I make.To make an image requires an idea and it seems that the ideas are generated and percolated from a constant process of seeking patterns and connections. It is a process that I feel no control over as my mind wanders about my brain. The next step seems to be envisioning the idea as expressed in a medium and it is there at that conscious level (the level of knowing that there is something of energetic substance) to render in material means. And I make a choice.It would be my hope that any medium be able to be used for the unique qualities it contains, and there are artists, viewers, and thinkers able and willing to have that conversation. It is not a competitive event with winners and losers as much as it is a kind of bazaar with a variety of images.The market is only one aspect of art and not perhaps the primary one. The market affords the opportunity for individuals to realize some sustaining benefit for their labors.

It is because Palpatine was so rarely seen that it was a surprise that he personally traveled to oversee the progress of the second Death Star. A gathering of the military escort of the size that escorted him to the forest moon of Endor was unheard of.Palpatine spent much of his time meditating in the dark side of the Force and looking into the future, planning, while keeping a close reign on his closest servants who did his every bidding.","1,913 followers",Brett Lissaman,1.2K,472,20M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-advanced-technology-from-science-fiction-books-and-movies-will-probably-never-become-a-reality-and-why

I require your wand.”“My Lord?” Lucius inquired, unsure.The Dark Lord raised his eyebrows, displeased; but before he could say anything, the massive oak doors burst open and Wormtail scurried in.“My Lord,” he trembled as the Dark Lord’s serpentine eyes narrowed in anger, “There is a stranger outside the Manor who demands an audience with you.”“Then eliminate him!” Voldemort spat. “I have no time for such foolishness.”“My Lord, he claims that you are a pathetic imitation of a Dark Lord, and that he wants to show you the true power of the ‘dark side’.”A moment of silence, and then the Death Eaters burst into a full-on cacophony of laughter, but Voldemort raised his eyebrows in immense displeasure.“My Lord,” Bellatrix’s eyes gleamed with sadistic glee, “Let me destroy this impostor for you-”“No.” Voldemort’s voice was eerily calm, at the same time sending her a chilling glance that shut her up instantly. “I shall deal with him myself. You will all remain here until my return.”“Ah yes,” the Dark Lord smirked as he descended the steps of Malfoy Manor, “Here you are. You must be rather brave - or foolish! - to come here and challenge me for the throne. Identify yourself, before I slay you in the most painful and excruciating way possible.”The stranger was dressed in a dark cloak, with a hoodie covering most of his face.

It disgusted the Dark Lord that this impostor would bring such an artifact in his presence.““Insolent fool!” Voldemort’s anger flared up at the final comment. “Tell me your name, before I show you what true darkness feels like!”The stranger laughed, his voice high-pitched and disturbing. Something about this person felt utterly“I am Darth Sidious, Dark Lord of the Sith and Emperor of the known galaxy. Your magic is insignificant next to the power of the Dark Side.”“Sidious?” Voldemort spat. “What kind of name is that? Are you a Mudblood?”“Mudblood?” Sidious inquired loftily. “As I said, I do not hail from your world. Your narrow-minded views on blood supremacy do not concern me.”“How dare you?A jet green light exploded from the tip of Voldemort’s wand, and Sidious shifted like a liquid shadow, a blur of speed dancing around the periphery of Voldemort’s vision. Before the Dark Lord could react, he felt a searing pain on his wrist-His mouth opened in silent shock as his severed hand fell to the ground.Voldemort didn’t even get the time to properly scream before he felt something constricting around his throat, cutting off his access to oxygen. He flailed around in vain as an invisible force lifted him off the ground.“Pathetic,” he heard Sidious sneer, as the latter wielded a strange glowing red sword which promptly vanished into the metal cylinder, “I expected so much more.”Voldemort tried to speak, but his words were cut off as Sidious applied more pressure around his throat.Impossible! How could this impostor defeat him! He was the strongest Dark Lord to ever rise in a century, and yet he was being manhandled by a filthy Muggle-“Do you know who I am?” Voldemort heard the man speak. “I am a Dark Lord of the Sith, an Order that has wielded the Dark Side of the Force for millennia.”“Like you, we channel our powers through our darker emotions. Anger. Hatred. Greed. Lust. Destruction.“Unlike you, we do not require little wooden sticks and spoken incantations to channel our powers. The Force is far more efficient than that.”He released Voldemort from the chokehold, the Dark Lord struggling and wheezing for air.“Your pathetic imitation of a“Sidious turned his head around to see a squad of Death Eaters hurriedly descending down the steps, wands drawn. Bellatrix and Lucius were at the lead, the former screeching maniacally and firing a volley of curses.The Sith Lord relinquished his hold on Voldemort and drew his blade, easily deflecting the spells. A quick pulse of Force Lightning incinerated the woman, along with several of the Death Eaters; another Force wave sent the remaining survivors flying into the air.He shifted his attention back to Voldemort, who had regained his footing and had already aimed a curse at him-“Crucio!”Sidious angled his blade and deflected the curse once more. Voldemort, however, took the chance to apparate away, vanishing into thin air in the blink of an eye.Sidious staggered back, slightly startled, but he quickly used the Force to pinpoint the location which Voldemort would reappear.A steady stream of Force Lightning blasted from the Sith Master’s fingertips which hit the Dark Lord as he re-manifested, sending the latter kneeling and screeching in pain.“Teleportation? Another interesting ability.” Sidious commented. “I look forward to learning from you.”Reaching out into the Force, Sidious channeled the Dark Side and focused it into a blade of psychic energy that madeHorcruxes.Ah yes, Sidious smiled. The power to cheat death. A prize that every Sith before him had sought to claim for millennia. While his master Plagueis had achieved that through midichlorian manipulation, Sidious never had a chance to learn from him.But this - this was different. Splintering souls into vessels which can be hidden - it would make Sidious virtually indestructible. He knew that soul-splitting was a disturbing concept, even for some Sith Lords - but Sidious had no such moral restrictions.And Sidious also sensed something else. A boy…….some kind of ‘Boy who Lived’ that Voldemort sought to kill, a boy that was supposedly destined to destroy the Dark Lord.The Sith could sense the boy’s power within Voldemort’s memories, and even he felt surprised. The boy possessed so much potential in the Force, he could almost - just almost - rival even the Skywalker boy in power.He would make the perfect apprentice, yes. Vader was a shadow of his former self, and Sidious would see to it that this boy would grow to one day replace him.What was the boy’s name again? Ah, yes.Satisfied with what he had found, Sidious casually snapped Voldemort’s neck.The Dark Lord was now dead, but not truly destroyed. He still had his horcruxes, which meant that Sidious still had much work to do.And most of all, he had a Potter boy to find.I know Voldemort is really powerful, and his Avada Kedavra can easily kill anything that it comes to contact with, but here’s the thing:(1) Wizards are slow. They need to draw their wands, mutter an incantation, and then aim the spell at an opponent.(2) Spells are slow. Even non-Force-sensitives like Harry Potter can easily dodge curses.Imagine what a Force-sensitive, with the precognitive power of the Force to aid them, can do against a wizard.And then imagine how Darth Sidious, arguably the most powerful Sith in history, would be able to counter a wizard opponent.And for good measure, Sidious at his absolute has destroyed fleets with Force storms, enslaved billions with his psychic energies alone, and did all of the above from thousands of light years away, without even being present.Even the weakened, canonical version of Sidious can disable tens of thousands of ships with his Force Lightning. Voldemort would be incinerated by said lightning as an aftereffect.Voldemort is farNOTE: At practically everyone’s request, a sequel has been posted here:I’m not sure if you guys may like it, but it’s just my own pathetic attempt to write a proper story.

Palpatine had no need to make Vader stronger.Palpatine also had a history of replace his apprentices with someone stronger. He let Anakin Skywalker kill Count Dooku for that very reason: Dooku was no longer useful to Palpatine. Anakin was.This makes it not surprising that Palpatine would later want to replace Vader with his son. It was a pattern with him. He had done it before.","1,913 followers",Brett Lissaman,930,472,20M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-advanced-technology-from-science-fiction-books-and-movies-will-probably-never-become-a-reality-and-why
21,"What limited vaders power wasnt the suit. It was most of the living tissue being removed by obi wan. The force couldnt flow through him properly. His suit was actually painful and uncomfortable boosting vaders connection to the dark side through anger and pain, much like darth bane with the orbalisk suit. Anakin was the most powerful force user in the galaxy until 3/4ths of his body was destroyed so sidious set his sights on the next most powerful. Vaders son.","2,094 followers",John Bambrook,550,1.2K,23.9M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Can-any-tell-me-that-how-can-we-innovate-the-business-and-society-problems-by-using-advanced-technology-in-this-modern-world-to-enable-growth-of-our-country
