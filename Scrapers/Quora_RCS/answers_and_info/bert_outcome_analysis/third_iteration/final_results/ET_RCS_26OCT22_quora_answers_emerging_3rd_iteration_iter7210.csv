A loosely organized step by step solution based on years of observation:First, fire all of the members of California's Homeless Coordinating and Finance Committee. I don't care who the council members family and friends are, they are doing a terrible job then they should be replaced. Maybe the citizens can vote the council members in next time, like a real Democracy.Second, admit that drugs addicts make up about 80% of the homeless population.Third, Enforce the law. Last time I checked heroin is illegal. See someone shooting up, arrest them.Fourth, Enforce the other laws. It's not illegal to not have a home. Is it illegal to be a public nuisance, steal bikes, and urinate at parks, arrest them.I can hear it now:I agree, which is why we need the next step.Fifth, We need to think like the Nordic Countries…but only when it comes to their criminal justice system. 93% of criminals successfully re-enter into society in Norway. And it is NOT because they pay more taxes. It's because they have a system that meets the needs of each individual.I never thought it was fair to put the kid that was caught selling pot into a cell with the guy that murdered 16 women. It's illogical to put the guy serving 1 year with everything to lose at the mercy of the guy serving life with nothing to lose.And we're surprised they have issues post release? Nordic Solution: different “holding facilities” for different types of criminals.Sixth, You get released when the addiction is over and you find a job. You can wander, use the internet, watch TV, and you even get your own room. No more free phones. They can use the facilities phones. That ensures they are looking for jobs and not calling for drugs. The Correctional Officers will drive them to interviews as needed. They will even be provided with snazzy clothes to wear to the interview.Seven, What employer would be willing to hire ex-addicts? Well, lots of them if you make it worth their while. Give them huge employment tax cuts, lower the workman comp rates, I don't know.Eight, Stop illegal immigrants from crossing the border. They work for less money and with China and Robots in the mix there just aren't enough jobs or houses. Legal immigration, hell yeah, always. Illegal immigration, no. Plain and simple.So we have the availability. We have the employers willing to hire. We are monitoring the money we put into helping the homeless by ensuring it isn't spent on drugs.Now we move on to the housing situation:Eight point five, lower the credit score standard. If they lost their house their credit sucks. Make it a pass/fail system for mortgage loans and you'll see that people do pretty well when given a second chance.That's it, that's the solution.Unfortunately, this would never happen. The State of California will never loosen its grip. The politicians will never genuinely care about the homeless if they are controlled by the same network of individuals. Californians are too politically correct to call them on their Bullshit and think outside of the box, so I'm afraid this will never become more than just another lengthy opinion.","135,552 followers",Hector Quintanilla,6.4K,1.2K,88.6M,2019,https://www.quora.com/How-can-the-technology-in-the-world-be-used-to-solve-hunger-poverty-corruption-health-related-problems-illiteracy-and-other-problems-faced-in-most-of-the-developing-nations

The thing is we have to take a look at the innards of a country to really know whether or not you are truly developed. That Chinese are so obsessed with portraying the facade that they are technologically advanced and ahead is actually an indication that they have not fully developed yet. Because fully developed countries have no need to show off things like that. Everyone knows they are developed.For example, here is San Francisco:Look, not many skyscrapers right? And look at those old cable cars going around! That must mean they are undeveloped right? Nope. Everyone knows San Francisco is a developed city. That’s why it has no need to show off with luxury skyscrapers and such things.Or how about Florence, Italy?Again, no skyscrapers here. But everyone knows it’s a developed city and Italy is a developed country.My point is, you have got to look at the people and the innards of a country to truly know if they are developed.This is the true face of China:You have got to look at the average person. Does the average Chinese have good access to healthcare (which is ranked near the bottom in WHO rankings btw)? Can they drink tap water safely? Do they have access to quality food? Do all have access to electricity or paved roads or a quality education? The answer is: probably, yes, if you are living in the rich east coast provinces of Jiangsu or Zhejiang or Guangdong- but not if you are living in say - Xinjiang or Gansu or Tibet. China’s wealth is not spread equally, neither is it developed equally. Even though the CCP has developed China quite fast - there is still a lot of work to be done making sure *every Chinese* have equal access to everything.And then you got to look at the attitude of the people. When I was in China I found that you really got to look out for who you trust, because there is a lot of scams going on all the time. You never know what is real, what is fake, what is real price of anything. Why do these scams exist? Because people have to be desperate to make money that’s why.Why are people desperate to make money? Probably because they are not making enough to survive, which is an indication that the country is still developing. You’ll notice that in general, the more developed a country is, the less likely there will be scams. In Korea/Japan/Taiwan, you will not find very many scams. In China and Eastern Europe it’s likely.Another aside I want to note is that Chinese bathrooms don’t contain any toilet paper. Do you know the reason why? It’s because people steal it. Now, in what developed country does this happen? I can’t think of any. Only in a developing country would you need to bring your own toilet paper to the bathroom because there isn’t any there due to fear of people stealing it.I find GDP/capita to be generally a pretty good indicator of how developed a country is. The average GDP/capita (PPP) of China is still around $8k/person. While that is higher than most Asian countries - it’s still below the 4 East Asian tigers + Japan and far from the $62k/person that the USA has.The true measure of a developed society is to observe the people that live in the country and not the appearance of the country itself. Chinese “face” culture is the same. You can just obviously see that China has developed really really fast, and mentality wise people are still harping about luxury products and consumerism - this is where Americans were back in the 50s, 60s and 70s, not now.The biggest consumers of luxury products are Chinese people, not Americans or Europeans. The more developed you are, the less need you have to validate your self worth with materialism. The less desire you have to spend thousands of dollars on your children's schooling just to send them to be educated abroad. The less need to travel to countries like Canada or USA for giving birth so that your child becomes a US or Canadian citizen, or to launder your money by buying up real estate in other countries. Developed countries do not need to do things like that.Thats why you should always pay attention to the old adage -Edit:Of course, Chinese commenters love to bring up the USA. Yes, USA has lots of impoverished areas too; every country has developed areas and undeveloped areas, however my point is that for China there is significantly more undeveloped areas at a higher % compared to the USA. The poverty rate for China is 16% as of 2019 and for USA it is 1.5% as of 2019.

They kept asking me, “why does it look so poor here, I thought America is rich and developed.” And I kept trying to explain to them how east cost is very different, and how, at least in SoCal, the state is not that huge on infrastructures, which is why it might not be as “fancy” as you have imagined prior to coming here.Small towns in China are relatively “third world.”Small towns in China, generally speaking and mind my words, are forgotten and underdeveloped shit-holes where young people have left for their pursuits of better lives in the cities; or they have grown into cities because of immigrants from other towns; or they have become popular holiday travel destinations that people wish to keep them “un-developed.” Whereas in Japan, smaller towns still feels “developed.”Generally speaking, the current generation of Chinese are mostly small-towners who migrated to cities with a “third-world” mentality.People in general are not as well-mannered, which in my book, is a very important symptom of a developed country.This is Wuzhen, in Zhejiang, China. I was there about 10 days ago. It is a small town, with no skyscrapers, infrastructures, and not famous for being modern or developed, but, now, an increasingly popular tourist destination.

Something as complex as a modern fighter jet would require expertise and exacting discipline in multiple fields, which we do not have as those are never really our priorities.Let's just take one: metallurgy.

Thus, we proposed a local aircraft joint-venture (JV) development program with our european partners called Regenerative Electric Multi Purpose Integrated Tekpifighter (REMPIT). This program is still under development and on-going review by Malaysian government. It will put Malaysia on top level of new generation aircraft manufacturing.In fact, we have enough local experts in high precision manufacturing sector. PROTON and PERODUA are both national cars were developed from scratch. Furthermore, we have local companies that got licenses to manufacture aircraft parts for AIRBUS and BOEING.

Only the US, China, Russia, UK and France are capable of producing the most important component of a fighter jet - the turbofan engine. In order to possess the technology and know-how to build an average 3.5-Gen fighter jet, it is necessary to partner with one or more of the Industry leaders.A good example is the single-engine multi-role fighter jet JF-17 Thunder jointly-developed by Pakistan and China. Development of the aircraft started in 1999 and the maiden flight was conducted in 2003. Pakistan can now independently produce the fighter jets on its own.Currently China and Pakistan are in the final stage of launching the enhanced version of the JF-17 which will have upgraded avionics, air-to-air refuelling capability, data link, enhanced electronic warfare capability and enhanced load carrying abili...","99,918 followers",Alcatraz Dey,4.1K,1.4K,68.3M,2017,https://www.quora.com/How-can-the-technology-in-the-world-be-used-to-solve-hunger-poverty-corruption-health-related-problems-illiteracy-and-other-problems-faced-in-most-of-the-developing-nations

Those would beFighter pilots live and love to dogfight, not driving bomb dumpers. Yawn. And there was no way in hellIn Operation Desert Storm, Saudi’s named the F-117 ""Shaba,” Arabic for ""Ghost.""Since other Answers here provide such extraordinary technical details—I’ve learned a lot—I shall do what I always do in these circumstances: tell (true) stories.In the late ’70s, I was in flight training at Burbank Airport (now Bob Hope Airport), north of L.A. I chose this field for its array of flight operations: military, airline and corporate. Often, waiting in a “congo line” to take off, we’d find our little Piper Archer rocking in the kerosene exhaust of a Grumman Gulfstream, Bombardier Global Express or other biz jet. “Heavy iron,” my instructor called them. He showed me that the last two letters of the craft’s “N number” were the owner’s initials, often those of a movie star from nearby Hollywood: N904LD = Leonardo DiCaprio.There was an extremely secretive operation at Burbank: Lockheed’s famed Skunk Works. The U-2 and SR-71 Black Bird spy planes were designed here by aeronautical super starJohnson (left) withAt Burbank I befriended the tower controllers and would often climb up to the glassed-in cab—impossible these days, of course. One morning I came up and a controller said, Oh, boy! You missed the fun last night, Cameron.Seems the Air Force had called up and ordered them to douse the lights on the field at precisely midnight. Ha. The controllers pointed out that legally they couldn’t do that. The Air Force played their ace: the “national security” card. The controllers refused to fold. Nope. USAF had to settle forAt midnight, a gigantic C-5 (for you non-pilots, this is the largest USAF cargo plane) landed and trundled over to the Skunk Works, sticking its monster snout into their black hangar. Tall shrouds were erected to block view of the C-5’s loading ramp. Grim USAF security in trademark blue berets and automatic weapons established a perimeter around the mammoth plane. It hastily gobbled up something skunky and flew off.Lockheed C-5 Galaxy. Its cargo deck is 1 foot longer than the Wright Brother’s first flight.Next day, the field was abuzz as controllers, pilots and ramp boys speculated on That Top Secret Thing snatched from the Skunk Works in the night. Was Lockheed “reverse engineering” an alien craft? Gee, do you think the government really has…alien pilots on ice? You know, the usual UFO clap trap.Now, this amuses me about our Air Force. They love to go:Much later, we’d learn that the skunky thing wasHave BlueHave Blue. 60% scale F-117 prototype.

One reporter asked to what altitude this zone extended. “To infinity.” WHAT? “Years later, we’d learn that the unfortunate craft was our littleF-117s were temperamental and required exceptional maintenance.Let’s return to my point about pilots and the (sexual) aesthetics of their fighter jets. Oh go ahead, laugh! I say sex is an unspoken factor here—and sometimes spoken, as you’ll see in a sec.There’s an old adage in the world of business:In 1993, the Pentagon established a massive $200I looked at them. Now, I’m no fighter jet expert, but without knowingBoeing X-32Lockheed Martin X-35Why so certain? Well, look at them. The Lockheed is sleek and sexy in its graphite paint scheme, its come-hither canopy and raked tails. It’s a fighter jock’s dream! The X-32 is anything but. It’s more like—forgive me, Boeing—a happily vomiting albino frog with wings. Am I too unkind?In the testosterone-drenched world of fighter pilots, flying a sexy airplane is like going on a hot date. SeenBeyond the beauty of its lines, swing-wing Tomcat could fly faster—1544 mph and further, 575 mi—than its successor, the uninspiring McDonnell Douglas Hornet, (1190 mph and 460 mi.) And Tomcat regularly blew off Air Force jocks in mock air battles.But Secretary of Defense Cheney had this inexplicable hostility toward Tomcat: it was a Grumman “jobs program.” (Hey, what defense program isn’t?) It had “60’s technology”(uh, ever heard of…upgrading?) He denied a last-minute Navy plea to keep a few beloved, yowling Tomcats around.Some say he was bribed by Boeing. Could be. He certainly went to extraordinary lengths to make sure Tomcats never flew again, ordering Grumman to destroy all its machine tooling, making it impossible to build future planes. (Can you imagine being the veteran Tomcat builder ordered to doThe only ones flying now (2021) are Iranian. Which it is why it’s illegal to own one. Parts. Tomcats can be found on static displays all around the country. Note: for those of you interested in owning a fighter, you can have a well-used McDonnell F-4 Phantom for $3MM.ByI am saddened that Mr. Cheney lacked the vision to appreciate Tomcat.Oh, well—’sigh’—we’ll always haveGrumman F-14 Tomcat, retired 2006. The Navy misses it…bad.Back to the Joint Strike Fighter competition:Strangely, the drooling jocks didn’t name the Lockheed plane and pilots(A pilot wouldn’t be caught dead uttering a warplane’s official name: A-10 Thunderbolt II, B-52 Stratofortress)Warthog firing its Avenger Gatling gun. Google up its unique “BRRRRT!” sound.The jocksWhy Monica? A jock would happily tell you with a wink and snicker: she’s got a big mouth, she’s ugly and…Now, if you’re still scratching at my stupid hinting, just Google up “Monica Clinton.” There’s your answer. And dear reader, I’m not being coy; we’re talkingCool Cat won, of course. (pilots had begun calling her Panther)She’s nowSure, Monica would have been way cheaper—Boeing had emphasized cost control—but trust me, there would have been a pilot mutiny if Air Force brass had embraced the Vomiting Frog over Panther. “Read my lips, General: we’re not flying that ugly, piece-a-shit.”Many thanks toThe F-117 was shot down once in the Kosovo War of 1998–99 when NATO flew it against Serbia. The historic shoot-down occurred on 27 March 1999.A Serbian commander of an Air Defense Missile Brigade, former bread bakerNow add NATO complacency. Since F-117 was supposedly invisible, the air staff got lazy and ran the same course to targets in Belgrade, the Serbian capital, on every mission. Fatal. Unfortunately, Dani was an especially clever air defense commander. He now had the Initial Point of the bomb run and a probable course into Belgrade.Serbian “Goa” Surface to Air Missile (SAM) waiting…So, when the next unwary Nighthawk came a-bombin’, Dani & crew pounced, hitting it with a brace of well-placed Goas. Badly damaged, the F-117 tumbled out of control, crashing in a field on its back. The pilot,The ultimate irony: Dale Zelko is of Yugoslav ancestry.Thanks toThe gleeful Serbs then invited the Russians and Chinese in for some serious reverse engineering of the belly-up F-117. That ended the 25 year American monopoly on stealth technology.Despite this costly embarrassment, Nighthawk continued in service for another 8 years. The Air Force had expected at least 13. But the Ghost had been outed and in the most humiliating way: by a tiny Balkan air force (Serbia combines air force and air defense) To add insult to injury, Ghost was downed byThen there was the F-117’s record in combat with its Paveway II laser bomb system. After it’s first several missions, the Air Force crowed that the plane had destroyed 80% of its assigned targets. However, on closer examination this was found to be wildly overstated. Like about 100% wildly.So, here we had this weird black plane which hit its targets barely half the time, which had embarrassed the Air Force and which was a bitch to maintain.And what was that impatient roaring in the wings?
