I was working at the Apple Store and I wanted a change. I wanted to start building the tech I was servicing.I started looking into Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI).There’s so much going on in the field.Every week it seems like Google or Facebook are releasing a new kind of AI to make things faster or improve our experience.Don’t get me started on the number of self-driving car companies. This is a good thing though. I’m not a fan of driving and roads are dangerous.Even with all this happening, there’s still yet to be an agreed definition of what exactly artificial intelligence is.Some argue deep learning can be considered AI, others will say it’s not AI unless it passes the Turing Test.This lack of definition really stunted my progress in the beginning. It was hard to learn something which had so many different definitions.Enough with the definitions.How did I get started?My friends and I were building a web startup. It failed. We gave up due to a lack of meaning. But along the way, I was starting to hearing more and more about ML and AI.“The computer learns the things for you?” I couldn’t believe it.I stumbled across Udacity’s Deep Learning Nanodegree. A fun character called Siraj Raval was in one of the promo videos. His energy was contagious. Despite not meeting the basic requirements (I had never written a line of Python before), I signed up.Three weeks before the course start date I emailed Udacity support asking what the refund policy was. I was scared I wouldn’t be able to complete the course.I didn’t get a refund. I completed the course within the designated timeline. It was hard. Really hard at times. My first two projects were handed in four days late. But the excitement of being involved in one of the most important technologies in the world drove me forward.Finishing the Deep Learning Nanodegree, I had guaranteed acceptance into either Udacity’s AI Nanodegree, Self-Driving Car Nanodegree or Robotics Nanodegree. All great options. I was a little lost. “Where do I go next?”I needed a curriculum. I’d built a little foundation with the Deep Learning Nanodegree, now it was time to figure out where I’d head next.My Self-Created AI Masters DegreeI didn’t plan on going back to university anytime soon. I didn’t have $100,000 for a proper Masters Degree anyway.So I did what I did in the beginning. Asked my mentor, Google, for help.I’d jumped into deep learning without any prior knowledge of the field. Instead of climbing to the tip of the AI iceberg, a helicopter had dropped me off on the top.After researching a bunch of courses, I put a list of which ones interested me the most in Trello.Trello is my personal assistant/course coordinator.I knew online courses had a high drop out rate. I wasn’t going to let myself be a part of this number. I had a mission.To make myself accountable, I started sharing my learning journey online. I figured I could practice communicating what I learned plus find other people who were interested in the same things I was. My friends still think I’m an alien when I go on one of my AI escapades.I made the Trello board publicThe curriculum has changed slightly since I first wrote it but it’s still relevant and I visit the Trello board multiple times per week to track my progress.Getting a jobI bought a plane ticket to the US with no return flight. I’d been studying for a year and I figured it was about time I started putting my skills into practice.My plan was to rock up to the US and get hired.Then Ashlee messaged me on LinkedIn, “Hey I’ve seen your posts and they’re really cool, I think you should meet Mike.”I met Mike.I told him my story of learning online, how I loved healthtech and my plans to go to the US.“You may be better off staying here a year or so and seeing what you can find, I’ think you’d love to meet Cameron.”I met Cameron.We had a similar chat what Mike and I talked about. Health, tech, online learning, US.“We’re working on some health problems, why don’t you come in on Thursday?”Thursday came. I was nervous. But someone once told me being nervous is the same as being excited. I flipped to being excited.I spent the day meeting the Max Kelsen team and the problems they were working on.Two Thursday’s later, Nick, the CEO, Athon, lead machine learning engineer, and I went for coffee.“How would you like to join the team?” Asked Nick.“Sure.” I said.My US flight got pushed back a couple months, I’ve also got a return ticket.Sharing your workLearning online, I knew it was unconventional. All the roles I’d gone to apply for had Masters Degree requirements or at least some kind of technical degree.I didn’t have either of these. But I did have the skills I’d gathered from a plethora of online courses.Along the way, I was sharing my work online. My GitHub contained all the projects I’d done, my LinkedIn was stacked out and I’d practiced communicating what I learned through YouTube and articles on Medium.I never handed in a resume for Max Kelsen. “We checked you out on LinkedIn and we were impressed.” My body of work was my resume.Regardless if you’re learning online or through a Masters Degree, having a portfolio of what you’ve worked on is a great way to build skin in the game.ML and AI skills are in demand but that doesn’t mean you don’t have to showcase them. Even the best product won’t sell without any shelf space.Whether it be GitHub, Kaggle, LinkedIn or a blog, have somewhere where people can find you. Plus, having your own corner of the internet is great fun.How do you start?Where do you go to learn these skills? What courses are the best?There’s no best answer. Everyone’s path will be different. Some people learn better with books, others learn better through videos.What’s more important than how you start is why you start.Start with why.Again, no right reason. All are valid in their own way.Start with why because having a why is more important than how. Having a why means when it gets hard and itGot a why? Good. Time for some hard skills.I can only recommend what I’ve tried.I’ve completed courses from (in order):They’re all world class. I’m a visual learner. I learn better seeing things being done/explained to me on. So all of these courses reflect that.If you’re an absolute beginner, start with some introductory Python courses and when you’re a bit more confident, move into data science, machine learning and AI.How much math?The highest level of math education I’ve had was in high school. The rest I’ve learned through Khan Academy as I’ve needed it.There are many different opinions on how much math you need to know to get into machine learning and AI. I’ll share mine.If you want to apply machine learning and AI techniques to a problem, you don’t necessarily need an in-depth understanding of the math to get a good result. Libraries such as TensorFlow and PyTorch allow someone with a bit of Python experience to build state of the art models whilst the math is taken care of behind the scenes.If you’re looking to get deep into machine learning and AI research, through means of a PhD program or something similar, having an in-depth knowledge of the math is paramount.In my case, I’m not looking to dive deep into the math and improve an algorithm’s performance by 10%. I’ll leave that to people smarter than me. Instead, I’m more than happy to use the libraries available to me and manipulate them to help solve problems as I see fit.What does a machine learning engineer actually do?What a machine engineer does in practice might not be what you think.Despite the cover photos of many online articles, it doesn’t always involve working with robots that have red eyes.Here are a few questions an ML engineer has to ask themselves daily.I borrowed these from a great article by Rachel Thomas, one of the co-founders ofFor more, I made a video of what we usually get up to on Monday’s at Max KelsenNo set pathThere’s no right or wrong way to get into ML or AI.The beautiful thing about this field is we have access to some of the best technologies in the world, all we’ve got to do is learn how to use them.You could begin by learning Python code.You could begin by studying calculus and statistics.You could begin by learning about the philosophy of decision making.Machine learning and AI fascinates me because of this intersection of fields.The more I learn about it, the more I realise there’s plenty more to learn. And this hypes me up.Sometimes I get frustrated when my code doesn’t run. Or I don’t understand a concept. So I give up temporarily. I give up by letting myself walk away from the problem and take a nap. Or go for a walk. When I come back it feels like I’m looking at it with different eyes. The excitement comes back. I keep learning.There’s so much happening in the field it can be daunting to get started. Too many options lead to no options. Ignore this.Start wherever interests you most and follow it. If it leads to a dead end, great, you’ve figured out what you’re not interested in. Retrace your steps and take the other fork in the road instead.Computers are smart but they still can’t learn on their own. They need your help.","27,585 followers",Gurmeet Bishnoi,2.8K,1.2K,80.4M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-are-next-gen-skills-to-learn-in-technology-business-intelligence

So they built a decentralised network of multiple computers instead.This meant the US could keep its part of the ""mutually assured destruction"" bargain even in case of a Soviet cyberattack.Web1In 1990, the Internet was a bunch of connected computers. The Web was its first application, created by Tim Berners-Lee.Web1 was designed as a ""hyperlinked information system.""Sounds familiar?30 years later, three billion users are connected to a much bigger, faster and more ubiquitous Web, powered by monstrous data centres. The clicking around has remained largely the same.In its early days, the Web was a niche tool, used almost exclusively by academics. Mass adoption came five years later with the introduction of browsers like Mosaic and Microsoft Internet Explorer.These were the good old surfing days. You'd dial in. Downloading a picture took years. Altavista was the default search engine. Nobody had thought of web design yet.Web1 was:Web1's decentralised infrastructure symbolised its original ethos.Web2Fast-forward 10 years, the Wild West had grouped around winners like YouTube, Facebook and Twitter, pulling in huge numbers of users and talent black-hole style.For the first time, anyone could publish online. As barriers faded, users and usage surged. The Internet had something for everyone.In the backend, three big shifts shaped Web2 as we know it today:The Internet has become centralised.Big Tech is extracting youAs we suddenly gained access to more people, ideas and technologies than our brains knew what to do with, the central platforms blew up like mushroom clouds, consolidating network effects into monopoly power.Networks become exponentially more valuable as they gain more users. You join WhatsApp to talk to your friends. Mom joins WhatsApp to talk to you. Dad joins WhatsApp to talk to mom. Before you know it, the whole world uses WhatsApp. You can't leave.In February 2021, WhatsApp changed its privacy rules in a take-it-or-leave-it announcement: it would harvest more user data for profit. Millions swore they would ditch the app for more private alternatives — including yours truly. Not enough to escape the network's gravitational pull, it turns out. While many chat on Signal and Telegram these days, few managed to get off WhatsApp completely. You still want to talk to Mom and Mom still wants to talk to Dad.In this digital era, customer value is a direct function of network size. Users can't leave. Startups can't compete. Media, developers and creators have no choice but to play ball. The network's pull is too strong.Locked in, we pay the price not in dollars but in personal data and content. To be mined, sold and fed back into secret algorithms that hijack our attention so we'd give more. All under the veil of ""free"" and ""improving user experience.""Your self-expression = their market cap.Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon (GAFA) control our conversations, searches, content, media and data. The open forum has become a walled garden.Why web2 sucksWe need a new Internet because the current one is broken. It's a multivariate problem.The attention economyStarting out, the Web didn't have a way for exchanging value. People weren't keen on pulling out credit cards online. So the default business model became to attract users with free stuff and sell access to their eyeballs: advertising.Attention became the Internet's native currency.Farming attention isn't new. The business of media has always been to keep you watching. To actually inform you might get you to tune out and take action in the physical world. But watching TV we are at least synced within the same self-perpetuating loop of opinions.On Web2, we are each fed a personalised diet of whatever triggers us most. Different opinions have become different facts. And as your alternative reality clashes with mine, Facebook's stock price goes up. The bigger the fire, the higher the profits. Social media brings the world together to tear it apart. Because it's good for business.When clicks equal revenue, there is no incentive to tell the truth. The result is clickbait, misinformation, fake news, ad blockers, and ad blocker-blockers.The Internet isPlatforms own everything you create online.Quite literally: whenever you upload anything to an internet platform, the file is copied onto its servers and ownership is passed to the company. It becomes the raw material algorithms mine to generate the attention advertisers pull out their wallets for. You sow, the platform reaps.There are returns for you too, to be sure. We wouldn't play ball if there weren't. Sharing content online builds reputation, audiences and connections. The kind of social capital that can be monetised in its own right. Artists and creators never had such instant access to so many potential fans.Still, all of it happens not thanks to but by mercy of the platforms. They own both your work and your followers. You'd lose it all if you'd left to try and make it outside the walls. And so you have no choice but to keep turning the wheels of their money making machine.Deplatforming & censorshipWhen Twitter and Facebook banned Donald Trump, he told his supporters to follow him to Parler. Next thing Apple and Google removed Parler's mobile app from their app stores. Whereupon Amazon delivered the final blow by kicking Parler's website from its hosting servers. Trump is digitally homeless.Here's how that works.Close to 90% of the Web is stored with four hosting providers,These companies control the gates to the global marketplace of ideas. You play by their rules or don't play at all.Even if you behave, you can still be guilty of living in the wrong place. Censorship is easy when all it takes is blocking a handful central servers, as governments know all too well. Take China's Great Firewall: as effective at keeping state secrets as at keeping Facebook, Twitter, Google and Wikipedia from its citizens. If (when)Hacker paradiseAn interconnected economy that combines decentralised data creation with centralised storage provides enormous rewards for hackers.Billions of devices uploading their data to a handful of giant data centres is like a central bank with infinite doors to break in. It means I could steal your bank credentials by hacking my neighbour's smart fridge.Today's Web is a chilling case of the maxim that a system can only ever be as secure as its weakest link. The crucial flaw is that the weakest link can't be fixed because new links are added every day. By design, the solution can never match the scale of the problem. And as commerce becomes ever more peer-to-peer and device-to-device, the problem is bound to snowball into systemic bankruptcy.Cybersecurity in its current form is aData breaches are the new standard for privacy. Cyberterrorism the new normal of geopolitics.The trust problemHow did we get here?The pioneers of the Internet never meant for it to be centralised.Trust is the certainty not to be scammed. When you trust someone, you're sure they'll behave along the lines you expect them to.In pre-civilised times this meant that, to stay safe, you only directly interact with friends and family. No trading information and value with strangers. If I don't know you, I don't do business with you. This capped the first hunter-gatherer societies at around 150 people: the maximum number of stable social relationships a human brain can supposedly manage (known asUnits of civilisationWhen the last ice age ended around 11,000 BCE, the nomads settled down in the Agricultural Revolution. Staying put for extended periods of time gave rise to private property and valuable possession (stored agricultural output). This was the cue for trust's alter ego to rear its ugly head. The incentive to steal had never been greater. To moderate the escalating violence between stranger tribes, we came up with third parties all strangers could trust: institutions.Institutions widen the perimeter of trust between strangers by keeping records of what happened. Who owns what, who owes what. Taxes, payments, properties, exchanges. Records affirm truth and truth constructs trust.In this sense, institutions are the basic units of civilisation. Offline economies can't exist without them. As it turns out, neither could the first online economy. The early Web too leaned into the old habit of centralised trust management shortly after its decentralised inception.Gatekeeper v2Unbounded by space and time, today's internet institutions have slashed the latency and cost of economic exchanges - unlocking instant global business.Networked software subverts the bureaucratic, fee-collecting middleman to reward individuals on both sides of supply and demand. Strangers can transact at scale in a peer-to-peer economy. The kicker is that the networks are owned and the house still takes most of the winnings.Institutions keep failing us because they are humanEvery institution that distributes power, money or status eventually falls to bias and corruption. Centralised internet platforms are no exception. It's fundamentally self-interested human behaviour playing out at scale: a feature, not a bug.That is not a fancy way of saying ""f*ck the system"" nor is it blaming bankers and Mark Zuckerberg for all of the world's problems.Blockchain: mathematics > humansThe diagnosis is two-tiered:The word 'trust' in itself suggests the possibility of fraud. They're two sides of the same coin.How can we keep records that are objective and immune to human bias?Minimum viable explanationDifferent blockchains demand different value. It can be security, storage, computation, bandwidth, attention. The wild multitude of possible applications is beyond the introductory scope of this post. And bound only by your imagination.Bitcoin — O.G. blockchainCryptodaddy Bitcoin makes for an intuitive case of how blockchains work. Its ledger keeps track of how much currency each user holds and rewards miners for securing the records.Ethereum — Distributed global supercomputerIf Bitcoin is a spreadsheet, Ethereum is a spreadsheet with macros.‍The idea of a network running applications should sound familiar.It's the original vision for the Web come true. Unhackable, uncensorable. Governed by its users and rewarding the work the network needs with a native currency. A trinity of Internet, free market and democracy.Web3: The Internet Of ValueDon't limit your imagination to decentralised versions of Twitter, Facebook and YouTube.Value exchanges follow a prototypical contractual pattern. There's a performance and a reward. If I do X, you give me Y. Bitcoin provides a simple example of how blockchains automatically verify both performance and reward, fulfilling the contract with 100% guarantee that no party gets duped.Think art, insurance, real estate, intellectual property, credit cards, lawyers. You'll be able to trade it all without middlemen, using dapps built on Ethereum or other smart contract blockchains like Solana instead. Trustless and permissionless. Cheaper and faster.The superior economic efficiency will open up previously impossible business models and possibly reinvent companies altogether.Blockchains allow everyone in the world with a phone and an internet connection to participate directly, immediately and without permission in the global economy.Web3 realmsSmart contracts unlock new modes for trade, work, and play. Here's a taste of where it's going.DeFi (Decentralised Finance)DeFi is crypto’s way of Wall Street.DeFi dapps let you swap, invest, earn, lend, borrow and insure financial assets directly with others users. Bankers are coded out: smart contracts automatically verify both ends of a transaction on the blockchain — slashing costs, overhead and bias. As of October 2021, ~$200bn of total asset value has been locked in DeFi protocols.NFT (Non-Fungible Token)A token is non-fungible when its value is perceived as unique, i.e. when it's not 1:1 interchangeable with another token. It's the perception that matters: dollar bills all have unique serial numbers, but qualify as fungible because the purchasing power of each is the same. It's a different story if you're a collector and care about the serial number.In that sense, NFTs are just tokens with serial numbers that matter. If you issue 1,000 entry tokens for a giveaway, those tokens are non-fungible if a higher number increases chances of winning. They're fungible if the token number doesn't matter.As I write this, NFTs have become hard to ignore. But as people and companies spend millions for Cryptopunks and Bored Apes,First, NFTs are on-chain tokens proving ownership of off-chain assets. They're not the assets themselves. Everyone can right-click + save a Cryptopunk .JPG, but only one wallet can hold its NFT.Second, NFTs are not synonymous with digital artwork or even digital assets.DAO (Decentralised Autonomous Organisation)As noted earlier, organisations can be simplified as synced webs of contracts.A DAO puts this idea on steroids, automating value transfers through smart contracts. Human managers are programmed out by code that is democratically agreed on by token holders. Each member owns a fraction of the DAOs assets and can weigh in on decisions proportional to token holdings — as programmed per smart contract.Integrating economic and social features, the DAO model makes companies more like communities and communities more like companies.‍Social tokensTokens capture the economic value of community membership,This is as true for ETH holders as it can be for any group of people. Brands, artists, creators, influencers can turn communities in economies through tokenisation. I myself could airdrop $GIL tokens to subscribers and mint NFTs of pieces I write. The more readers I get, the higher the economic value. More so if tokens also unlock exclusive content, a Discord group, events and other fun stuff.Play2earnNext, you can gamify the community by rewarding achievements with tokens.If you’ve ever chased Pokémon, World Of Warcraft weapons and FIFA player packs, you understand the value of digital assets. With a blockchain, digital assets become economically scarce. There’ll be only one Pikachu in crypto-Pokemon. And it won't have a central corporate game developer non-stop pulling in cash from players through infinite duplication of game items out of thin air. Instead, scarce assets are earned, owned and traded among game players in what is a proper economy. Yes, your kids will make a living playing video games.The MetaverseHuman-to-human economies, NFTs, tokenised communities and play2earn converge in what's known as the Metaverse: a virtual world for people to work, play and live. Not as distant a future as you might think. Big parts of our lives are already spent online. Further immersion will happen gradually over the next few decades.If the prospect of living in the cloud sends shivers up your spine, mind that in sci-fi virtual worlds feel dystopian mostly because of the central power that designs and controls them. These are web2’s version of the Metaverse, a virtual Facebook.A crypto-Metaverse is open and decentralised, built from the collaborative creativity of all its creators, economically allocated through supply and demand mechanicsInitially published in",789 followers,Polina Polukhina,750,0,0,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-are-next-gen-skills-to-learn-in-technology-business-intelligence

Yesterday the multi-page websites were popular, today the trend for simplicity brought single-page apps back on the top, so I'll tell you a couple tips aboutProgressive Web ApplicationsThe world first heard about progressive web apps in 2015. The next year we met the pioneers of this technology, and in 2017 progressive Web Applications seem to have become the major competitor of native mobile apps.Progressive web appsOnline customer support2016 was the year of chatbots. 2018 will be the year of helpful chatbots. Since there are thousands of bots out now, the quality of their services will be the next web development trend.The prediction is that 85% of all customer interactions will proceed without human assistance till 2020.A customer service chatbot becomes a must on almost every website. Whether you are selling electronics, crocheted toys or software development services, you should have a chatbot.Static websitesYou definitely remember the concept of a static website from the early years of the World Wide Web. All the first websites on the Internet were static.But then the era of dynamic websites began.Websites became more functional and easier to update even for people with no technical background. At the same time, the development process became more complicated, as the extended functionality required communication with the server, so backend development got involved. Modern CMSs are the actual dynamic websitesNowadays, the web is returning to its roots. Static websites are becoming the web development trend of 2018 again.Single-page websitesAnother web development trend for simplicity is single-page websites. This solution allows putting all the content onto one long scrollable page, removing any clutter.One-page websites have a bunch of advantages. They don’t challenge the visitor with complex navigation, multi-level menu, and tons of text. The essential information is all on one page. The user only has to scroll to it.Of course, the use-cases of single-pagers are limited. This type of website will not suit e-commerce projects and blogs. At the same time, businesses can significantly benefit, presenting their services in a simplified and more engaging manner.Push notifications for websitesMobile apps notifications turned out to be a highly efficient means of user re-engagement. And recently this idea has been implemented for websites and is becoming new web development trend.The workflow looks quite simple: the user visits a website and is offered to enable push notifications. The user will then be notified of any changes on the website (like a new blog post or a private message), even after he has closed the tab with that website.The major benefit of such a technology is obvious - you can keep the user engaged without big efforts.Flash to HTMLIn 2010 Steve Jobs published hisThe major weakness of this technology is the incompatibility with mobile devices. An enormous amount of traffic is lost just because of the outdated technology.Motion UISimplicity is the trend in recent years. This is also true for web design. Users are already tired of crazy GIFs and flashing ads, that’s why websites with moderate design get more appreciation.At the same time, sophisticated motion UI is becoming more popular. Animations allow to add more style and enable you to distinguish your website from the thousands of others with the static UI.There are several ways to add some life to your minimalistic website. Consider page header transitions, nice hovers, animated charts, background animations and modular scrolling. These and many other elements may make your web presence much more enjoyable for users. The true artwork!JavaScript - Angular 2 and Angular 4JavaScript is the number one programming language for web applications. With dozens of JS-related technologies already existing and still in development, it will even strengthen its positions. The highly anticipated release of the last years Angular 2 becomes highly appreciated in modern web development.We met Angular 2 in 2016. It is a complete rewrite of the AngularJS framework. The main advantages are improved modularity, app architecture scalability,PHP 7.x - Laravel 5.xPHP remains the popular choice for website backend development. This programming language has improved its positions even further after the release of version 7.x. The latest update of the PHP framework Laravel 5.x is a recognized web development trend in 2018.Laravel is the most popular open-source PHP web framework. All the benefits of it can be fully experienced on dynamic websites with complicated backend.Laravel offers ready solutions for complex tasks. The variety of existing packages makes the development process faster and more reliable. Regular updates ensure that the framework complies with the current needs of the website owners and the requirements of the time.Also I decided to describe the anti-trends of the year as well.

If I should guess what 300 years from now will be, I’m sorry, but all I can picture isArtificial Intelligence will be perfected by 300 years from now, with robots being able to detect that humans are killing their planet (Maybe). I should also mention that AI perfection will be the greatest technological achievement. That is where AI can not only think for itself, but also able to execute those thoughts. And they will also become autonomous to even write codes to create other robots.Humanity might become extinctI’ve watched movies about how robots turned on humans.
