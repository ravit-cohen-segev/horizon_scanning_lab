They would have had to develop on a planet with gravity not much dissimilar with that of the Earth and not radically different in terms of the environment. As such they would likely have an endoskeleton, rather than an exoskeleton for structural support - exoskeletons don’t work well for larger creatures. Bilateral symmetry is a must. They would likely have two eyes placed on a distinct head - optical sensors are exceptionally important and they independently evolved on Earth at least half a dozen times. All the important sensory organs have to be concentrated in one place close to the brain for better reaction times. We can say that them having 4 limbs is exceptionally likely because of how efficient locomotion works…","220,605 followers",Franklin Veaux,928,47.3K,782.8M,2019,https://www.quora.com/How-would-aliens-with-advanced-technology-perceive-humans-before-visiting

Yes, we convert Energy into Power by ”boiling the water,“ which has a low energy conversion rate. Today's principle of nuclear fission reactor power generation is not fundamentally different from steam engines hundreds of years ago! Regardless of the current thermal power or nuclear power, it is heating water: heat converts water into steam, and the steam drives the turbine to generate electricity. (Note: The conversion rate of nuclear fission we use today is only 0.135%)It is most likely that human beings will not be able to ""go out"" the solar system, and even be ""trapped"" to die on earth!The nuclear fusion conversion rate is 0.7%. If nuclear fusion power generation is realized, it may alleviate the current energy crisis. It is not enough for interstellar flight. (Note: As science fiction says that ""Positive and Anti-Matter Annihilation"" is the most efficient, can achieve 100% quality conversion, can help us fly out of the solar system. )Realistically, if we fail to master the controllable nuclear fusion before depleting fossil energy, it is not only ""Civilization Retrogression,"" but the entire human sci and tech civilization will be ""locked out"" until we die. Because in those days we will be unable to ""organize higher-scale industrialization"" and not be able to further test our scientific theory.Human beings are powerless and insignificant. Think of Traveler 1, the man-made object farthest from the Earth, and the fastest man-made object. It takes 40,000 years to fly to the AC+79 3888 star of Ophiuchus. It takes 73,600 to fly to Proxima Centauri of Centaur. The interstellar voyage for it is just a simple fantastic lies. How negligible us? Please be humble~As for interstellar travel, if the person who does not wear the spacesuit leaves the surface layer, just like ""The deep sea fish leave the deep sea will detonate himself"", yes, in any other environment, the human body will be vulnerable to ""cannot withstand even a single blow"". Hey, we humans are the creatures born in the surface environment. We are destined to be inseparable from such environment, and it is even more difficult to cross the ""space measured by light years."" The earth is the cradle of humankind and it will surely be our destination and cemetery.Almost all of the Earthian is still bound by gravity, and it is difficult to fly out of it.Humans used to go to the moon with ""The primeval Chemical Rocket,"" but never went to Mars. Most people are trapped in the earth's tiny plot of land, let alone the universe.Although we can now ""observe dozens of billions of light years of the universe"", no matter how influential bigwigs can't leave the earth. They can only be like the common people who feet can't leave the ground. Exhausting the limits of the power of human tech can barely enough landing on the moon, its number can be counted on the fingers of one hand.The natural resources in the universe are inexhaustible, but we can only divide into some hostile factions, scheme against each other, intrigued, mutual suspicion, resorting to deception… excessive competition for such a little bit of unremarkable resource on earth. The human civilization at this stage is still too primitive.I really want to ""strive for the cause of human civilization in the universe all my lifetime"", but now I can only ""work for the sake of making a living and fortune"", such a life is not reconciled.We even have not been able to explore the earth.In terms of crustal exploration, the deepest borehole that our drilled has just reached more than 10,000 meters depth. Our drill bit with difficulty went to the bottom of the crust for humans and took a look at the edge of the mantle. This depth is only equivalent to ""The worm takes a bite of apple peel."" This is why we cannot predict earthquakes because even the ""normal state"" of the crust can only be inferred by indirect evidence, and the judgment of its ""abnormal state"" is even more unreliable.…SummaryIt seems that some of today inventions of ""redoubtable and formidable"" are mostly the advancement of Applied Science, not the progress of Basic Science. The development of personal computers is only consistently integrated and shrinking smaller, supercomputers are always stacking and piled up, naturally, their computing performance is strengthened…But quantitative change is unlikely to trigger a qualitative change. It won't bring us quantum computers.The so-called ""innovative tide and creative spoondrift"" is just something ""in application-level."" Basic theory has been stagnant for a long time, and superstring theory has not progressed for many years. In any case, ""Basic Theory"" is the ""source power"" of human sci and tech development. Tomorrow, we may have some room for growth in the application of tech, but the development of the ""fundamental power"" has not been reformed for a long time!Chier Hu's answer to Has fundamental physics stagnated?Chier Hu's answer to Do you think our technology is primitive?Chier Hu's answer to Why is medical technology so primitive compared to computer technology?Chier Hu's answer to What are some examples showing how underdeveloped or powerless present-day human technology is?","74,720 followers",Tiny Nair,776,689,28M,2019,https://www.quora.com/How-far-do-we-need-to-advance-technologically-for-humans-to-not-have-to-work-anymore

When I was a kid, we could travel between Paris and New York in three hours and a half (if you had enough money to buy a ticket). You could take a Concorde at 9am in Paris and you could land in New York at 6:30 am local time, with a flight time duration of 3.30 hours. Today, if you want to fly to New York from Paris, the average duration of your flight would be 7.30 hours. Then I told him that the Concorde was designed in the 50s and 60s and her first flight was in March 1969. Here you can see a photo of this first flight:So in the XX century, there was a plane which needed less time to fly from Europe to America than another one in the XXI (at least until now).Then I showed him another airplanes that were designed in the ‘50s and ‘60s and began to fly in ‘60s-’70s:1.- A Boeing 747 the biggest airplane in history (passengers of course) until the arrival of Airbus A380:2.- An outstanding Blackbird; one of the fastest airplanes in history:3.- The Grumman F14:And Finally the superb Saturn V rocket -- the most powerful in history until the SLS begins to fly in the following years.So in the 1960s aeronautics and space engineering lived their golden era. Why? Because NASA had something more important than technology: political will and a lot of money to spend.

They aren’t around to satiate social media impulses (although they do have a few resources they use for live events).Heard about the Titan Mare Explorer?This was a proposed space probe, what might have been the first sea-based probe, floating in the methane seas of Titan. It and one other project lost out to the InSight probe, which recently landed on Mars in November 2018.So, internal discussions, projects and proposals that aren’t confidential (that is, of a sensitive nature that, if released, would be a violation of an individual’s privacy, or the security of a center, its employees, launch services or spacecraft) may eventually appear on a NASA site or resource.Ultimately, every government document makes its way for storage with the US National Archives, where any American can request copies.I can’t think of a single technology that NASA wouldn’t discuss, since they aren’t a company and have no ability to hold copyright on developed technologies. That said, many bright ideas under development may not have developed enough to speak about in a coherent or useful manner.So if NASA happens to be working on a warp drive, give them some time to get a prototype fleshed out before asking them about it.
