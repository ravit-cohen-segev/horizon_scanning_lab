2,"Humans are very likely evolving faster today than at almost any time in the past. Sounds crazy, right? How could this be? Let me explain.Most people think of evolution as operating on members of a species with “inferior” traits, thereby reducing their survivability and ultimate contribution to the gene pool. With this understanding, you’d then point to our modern longevity and note that “humans have largely solved the problem of survivability” — which we have.

With this understanding, you’d then point to our modern longevity and note that “humans have largely solved the problem of survivability” — which we have. We can remedy poor eyesight, compensate for chronic diseases, vaccinate against plagues, work around infertility, etc. But this understanding is based on a narrow view of evolution.Evolution operates at a species wide level across vast periods of time. And what is it looking for? You might say, “survival of the fittest” or “natural selection”. And that’s where a lot of the confusion comes from. With ever longer lifespans and no natural predators, evolution seems to be way back in the rear view mirror for Homo sapiens.

Grab a drink.This is a fairly interesting question, because there are so many different scenarios that can be gone through. Alternate advancement, the same tech (but a lot later down the line), full-on sci-fi utopia, etc.I’m not going to go through every scenario and just list the one that I personally see as being the most likely/most fun to think about.I think that if war never existed, it would go something like this;Alternate advancement.While there is no war, humans are still humans. We like to fight and compete. The world leaders understand this, and the more enlightened among us tell them this.With the “humans like to fight” fact firmly rooted in reality, both our current and alternate realities, there would be a “Peacekeeper” force for each nation. I use the term “Peacekeeper” because an actual military would be a foreign concept.The peacekeepers’ purpose would be as a safeguard against anyone who might “change their mind.”A Peacekeeper would probably look something like this, if not a 1:1 match.This is a soldier from the Death Korps of Krieg in Warhammer 40k. They heavily draw influence from World War 1 and 2 (mostly 1) in almost all aspects. Their uniforms, their strategies and tactics, and weapons (as far as ballistic weaponry goes). We would still have things like machine guns like the Maxim, rifles like WW2’s StG-44, and vehicles like the M3 Halftrack and the M12 Self-Propelled Gun.There is a twist, however.Wanna know what our homes and cities would look like? They would look like this.That’s the Citadel from Mass Effect. I’m not saying we will have floating cities in space, or contact with sentient extra-terrestrials, however. I’m simply saying “our non-peacekeeper tech would be ridiculously sci-fi.” Since there is no war, medical advancements, our homes, and general quality-of-life tech would be so far above what we have now, it would be considered ridiculous.Our world would be a contrasting combination of grungy Steampunk and sterile space sci-fi.The space race would ALSO still happen, just under different circumstances. It would still be a case of “I’ll race ya.” This is where the “humans like to compete” part comes in.With that in mind, we would indeed eventually have floating space cities akin to The Citadel in Mass Effect, and much sooner than we will in our current reality.Yet, our Peacekeeper tech would still be stagnant in WW1, WW2, and the intermediary years between the two.My inspiration for thinking this subconsciously came from a book (I forget the name of it. The rest of the details are extremely hazy….. I was drunk when he told me about this, so pardon me for inaccuracies.) my dad told me about a few years back, where there was a race of hyper-advanced aliens that conquered the galaxy, as far as they knew they could. Then, they stumbled across our current, real-life Earth. They contacted the US president (of course they did), and said “Earthlings, we are the most powerful and most technologicaly advanced empire in the galaxy. Surrender now or die!”Being humans, who love to fight, we laughed and said “come get us.”Next thing you know, a bunch of aliens start marching off of a troop ship. But what’s this? They’re wearing uniforms like Napolean’s troops…. they’re marching in lines across open fields… they’re performing musket volleys… what?Turns out that the reason why the aliens had such advanced space tech is because they almost completely ignored their military tech. Their experience up until this point had been Zulu War-esque.Suddenly, they’re fighting against US Marines, Army, Airforce, etc. armed with M16s, machineguns like M60s, M1 Abramses, B-52 bombers, AH-64 Apaches, and all other kinds of good stuff.Needless to say, we won that war, remembered what they said during their ultimatum about being “the most powerful and technologically advanced”… “Reclaimed” their ships and went on our own liberation spree across the galaxy, ’cause ‘Murica. Very suddenly, humanity was the most powerful race in the galaxy.Back to the question at hand;The reason I say our tech would be WW1-WW2 level is due to aforementioned “humans know humans like to fight” so we’d be a bit more advanced than firing lines with muskets.That’s all for now.

You just got my brain ticking.","5,990 followers",Jens Böttiger,566,2.6K,17.6M,2020,https://www.quora.com/How-did-we-develop-such-advanced-technology-if-we-were-only-created-by-evolution

Imagine - we would now be in the 600th year or so after man first took to space. Let’s imagine if Mezzo-America were not ravaged by Spain, or Baghdad never fell to the Great Khan - basically imagine we humans were not so prone to clashing violently when cultures first encounter each other, but rather more prone to collaborations, we might have already merged Gravity and Quantum Mechanics a couple of hundred years ago … we may have thought in our current lifetime of cancer as antiquated a problem as bubonic plague. Then again, we might have already produced sapient machines or hyper weapons and gone extinct, or disappeared into virtual reality by now …Basically - the long and short of it is this we are exactly as “advanced” as we “should be” … Because no matter what, there will always be fits and starts - if it wasn’t one thing it would inevitably be another. Learning and progress is a journey of peaks, valleys, detours, switchbacks, circles, and leaps. And while it would be amazing to know Berrosus’ ancient history in three volumes, or the actual original words of Jesus, or the surgical techniques of the pyramid builders, or seen the steam engines and wind turbines invented by Hero of Alexandria… actually accessing those things doesn’t preclude that history would have produced some other unavoidable correction that would have knocked us down a peg or two … or ten.",0 followers,James Owen,1.1K,0,0,2018,https://www.quora.com/If-language-never-existed-would-we-be-more-advanced-technologically-or-less

13,"Generally speaking, no.I wroteNonetheless, not everyone in ancient Greece and Rome thought this way and there certainly were people who believed that humanity was growing progressively more advaGenerally speaking, no.I wroteNonetheless, not everyone in ancient Greece and Rome thought this way and there certainly were people who believed that humanity was growing progressively more advanced. In my article, I talk about the Greek historian Thoukydides (lived c. 460 – c.  400 BC), who rejected the idea of an ancient Golden Age. Instead, he believed that humanity was growing steadily more advanced and that the Greeks of very early times must have been exceedingly primitive compared to Greeks of his own era.There were certainly Romans who thought similar things, although I cannot think of any specific examples off the top of my head. Nonetheless, I’m sure that even the ancient Romans who did realize that humans were growing more technologically advanced probably wouldn’t have imagined the kinds of technologies we have today.Back then, technological progress was moving much more slowly than it is today and I’m sure that even most progressive-minded Romans probably would have assumed that it happened at a constant rate. As it turns out, though, technological progress is exponential; every new invention makes the next invention come a little bit faster. Consequently, we have technologies today that few people in ancient times would have even dreamed of.ABOVE: Image of a man dressed in a less-than-historically-accurate Roman soldier costume riding on a Segway poorly disguised as a chariot","5,990 followers",Jens Böttiger,566,2.6K,17.6M,2020,https://www.quora.com/How-did-we-develop-such-advanced-technology-if-we-were-only-created-by-evolution
