New companies with sexy sounding names and no earnings rocketed up in price.At least, right up until they went to zero.After the recession came the “next big thing.”Single family homes appreciated 20% a year. People bought houses they couldn’t afford. Went into debt making the payments. Then refinanced and started over.Oh, and maybe added in a vacation home to double their fun.Then the real estate market collapsed. Banks quit lending. Owners couldn’t refinance. People walked away from their homes and their vaporous wealth.Since then I’ve watched the “next big thing” of gold, oil and Bitcoins. All bought in a frenzy right before the price imploded.See, the problem is, no one knows it’s the “next big thing” until everyone is talking about it over cocktails.By that time the vortex is sucking in enthusiastic speculators. Just in time to evaporate their wealth.So instead of speculating in “the next big thing” the most successful investors, I know of, buy cheap what no one else wants.Warren Buffett bought a wood furniture company in the midst of the tech boom.Then he bought a railroad in the midst of the Great Recession.Many thought he was nuts. “Old senile Warren has lost it,” some derided.Yep, pretty much. Except he bought both cheap because nobody wanted them. He fixed them up and eventually made a boat load of money when other investors rediscovered them.So you can keep chasing the current “next big thing.” And getting surprised, how just after you invest, it implodes.At least you can do that until you run out of money.Or do like old senile Uncle Warren. Look for what no one wants. Buy it cheap. And wait for it to become a “sort of big thing”.Me? I like Uncle Warren. And wish I was half as senile and wealthy.Real wealth isn’t built chasing what is popular but what will be popular.","135,529 followers",Hector Quintanilla,582,1.2K,88.6M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-next-big-thing-to-invest-in-in-the-tech-world

So much can be done with it, yet it has been primarily confined to areas of gaming and movie watching.The most important thing about this new technology was how intuitive it was. Every benefit that came from it was intrinsically linked to human biology. Humans evolved in a real, physical world, looking at complex 3D environments instead of flat screens.Because of this, VR is best used for socializing or learning. A reader on Quora may be impressed by a high follower count, while a reader from google may not be. In VR, however, this is different. Seeing an imposing, strong looking character is impressive and has evolutionary roots in our biology.(20 dollars, guys. This skin costs 20 dollars. But is it worth it to players? I’d argue yes)Despite the intuitiveness, however, VR has several drawbacks. It isn’t faster at completing tasks, like one can do on a computer. Most VR programs use drag and drop options, as opposed to the extensive, quick functionality found on a keyboard.VR also can cause motion sickness. This is a problem that should be resolved entirely within the next few years, so it is not an existential threat to the technology.Ultimately, VR has an important niche in it’s intuitiveness. It will likely not become a massive piece of world technology the way phones have become, but it will provide important access to faster learning, intuitive design, and more immersive gameplay.I hope to see it grow.","45,629 followers",David Seidman,790,3.6K,85.1M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-next-big-thing-to-invest-in-in-the-tech-world

You should be able to go out and find a house you like, and then buy it.

Actually, there are auction sites where youBut I will always have a job, and I chalk it up to human nature.Buying a house should be easy. You should be able to go out and find a house you like, and then buy it. But there’s so much drama.Here’s some of the issues I’ve seen pop up over the years:A buyer wanted to buy a house near the beach, and yet seemed astounded when I advised her that she needed flood insurance.I had a seller tell my customers as that some river rocks around the house made it “termite proof.” I had to convice these customers that there is no such thing as “termite proof” in Florida.The first thing almost every buyer asks when they sign a purchase agreement for a home is, “How do I get my money back if…” (the question is always open ended). In other words, they’re already thinking of backing out before they’ve even made the offer.In a sale where I had the buyers, the sellers claimed on a written disclosure that the home never had termites, yet proudly presented receipts for work done to repair “extensive termite damage.”I’ve had the sellers in a transaction swear a home was termite free. After termites were discovered and a pest service came out to fumigate, the neighbor strolled over and said, “Well, they’re finally doing something about those termites.”After a lender told me three days before closing that the buyer’s paperwork was good and we would close on time, the lender literally disappeared. I had the sellers and it was a very rough month until we could close again with another lender.I once had a couple lose a house because they put off some required paperwork in order to go play bingo.At a home inspection one of my partners attended, he opened the door to find a man with a gun drawn. The seller didn’t bother inform the tenant (with the gun) that people were coming over that morning. The tenant thought someone was breaking in.Is a pattern emerging here?So why do you need a Realtor?Because in every real estate transaction at least one of the parties visits Crazyland somewhere along the way. And that’s normal.The Realtor’s core value, the sole reason we exist, is to keep the other side honest and to massage away problems when they happen.A real estate sale is probably the highest dollar transaction a regular person will ever be involved it. It creates a huge amount of stress.Because of this stress I often see people at their very worst.They break promises and lie because they think telling the truth will cost them money. Usually it ends up costing them money anyway and it always takes a Realtor to iron things out. With grace and with tact.So even though I’m the business of selling a staple product (food and clothing being the other two), I actually owe my job to human nature.Honestly, I would rather deal with sane people. But when one of my agents comes in with a transaction blowing up I tell them, ""That's our job, that's the reason they need us. Let's go save somebody's world again...""",2 followers,Steven Burton,1.1K,720,14.7M,2014,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-next-big-thing-to-invest-in-in-the-tech-world
