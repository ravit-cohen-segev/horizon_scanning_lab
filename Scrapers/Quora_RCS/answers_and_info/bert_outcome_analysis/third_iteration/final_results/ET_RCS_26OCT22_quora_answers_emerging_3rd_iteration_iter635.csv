Every second counts if you‚Äôre preparing for an exam like JEE-Mains.Make your vision clear and start studying.I can give few tips:1] First, focus on topics you enjoy solving and make them your strengths.2] Use Internet only for the Online Tests!! Inform your parents to keep a strict eye on you.3] Reveal your mistakes through tests. Just solving doesn‚Äôt help at all! Please go through the concepts used there. No need to mug up the solutions at all.4] Forget about what will happen in the future. Remove those random thoughts: If you have enough time, If you can compete the huge crowd, If you will be successful. Success can‚Äôt be granted until and unless you take it as a joy, passion and not as worry or a rumor.5] Don‚Äôt get confused between books. Pick up a single book for each subject and follow it.

So here it goes :Starting from my 7th class, my Dad brought this book: I was amazed by its problems and my curiosity in science started growing up.He bought it till the 10th class. In 10th class, I was motivated to be an IITian in the future but at a National Level I was not that talented, I was a Normal student in any school who tops in his class of 45 students and blasts in Joy.I didn't know how to prepare? should I take admission in the coaching class? (as till 10th class I never had been to any tuition class). There were many doubts. I said to my father that I need to be admitted to a coaching class, even he didn't knew about coaching classes. I just knew that ‚Äúto prepare for JEE one Must go to Kota‚Äù, so I said this to Mom and Dad that I need to move to Kota. They once agreed but were equally confused and scared about how he can manage to go there and compete. My Father said, ‚ÄúWe will talk later‚Äù.So, I was in the 10th class, and around my first sem exams, my father told me that his friend advised him about some coaching class in Pune. I was disappointed because I wanted to move to Kota (Allen) as I only knew Allen at that time. I thought my Father will get me admitted to some shitty coaching classes. I was upset. I asked him the name of the coaching class. He said ‚ÄúFIITJEE‚Äù. I never heard of this name.He said about its selection procedure and Fees reduction scheme through scholarship. I gave the Entrance examination ofI gave my 10th Board exams, went well. Now just after 1 month from the boards FIITJEE started its classes for IITJEE preparation. (From around 19th April 2016)I was enrolled in PINNACLE Program IITJEE (2 year Integrated). It means you go to school and there itself FIITJEE teachers will teach you. The School was approximately 11.5KM from my home. I didn't got any VAN facility because it was very far and the fees it took were huge. So, I decided to go by PMT Bus. I went by BUS (First time alone).On the first day itself, I was late a bit. All students were New to me. The teacher was teaching Set Theory. The school (junior college) was Just a building nothing more. I was not able to cope up with the environment and studies. I felt like leaving it and get back to my good olden school days, where no competition was there.But, as time passed I made many friends and was shining little a bit but not more. I always came in Top 5 in my coaching class. Only one student came 1st in my Whole 2 years journey there. He only, Always, I‚Äôm not joking. I came 2nd many times. Not only in my class but in FIITJEE exams held at a large scale, He even topped there. I made him my Idol for JEE preparation. We were good friends, soon we were more than good. After reshuffling exam a batch of 20 students were separated, I was there in it.Through quora, I read answers written byI learned one thing : (*described below)Now, came my 12th class. Preparation was going really very well, but my performance in the test series was not appreciable. I needed a huge improvement. My family thought he will get a seat in IIT for sure but only needs to improve the rank. Deep down I knew, I needed a huge improvement. I started preparing more and more hard. I revised daily. Also, in 2 years (11th + 12th) I never missed a Single class of coaching. In the last 5 months many students didn't came to class because the syllabus was completed. Some left the hope and started preparing for BITSAT, etc . exams. I was going to class for more 2 months (I SHOULD HAVE NOT GONE). I got less time as going to class in the last months of preparation is a dumb idea. They revise your syllabus but it was not worth it as You need to practice and do SELF-STUDY.I was left with just 2 months, 12th boards were coming next month and then JEE Mains 2018. After Boards (went good), there were just 15 days for JEE Mains 2018. I revised, solved previous year questions. Here comes JEE Mains, I gave the exam, thought I did well. But, I didn't, I got around 10k rank in JEE Main 2018. I was disappointed . Not losing hope, I started the preparation of JEE Advanced 2018. Gave JEE Advanced, I again thought I did well, at least will get a good IIT.I didn't wanted to take a drop. So I decided to take admission through JEE Main. I had an interest in Aerospace. I was getting CS at COEP, Pune through MHT-CET. But, with interest in Aerospace, I took admission in IIEST Shibpur, Howrah, West Bengal in Aerospace Department. At that time I saw a guy in Newspaper who got 36th Rank, he was a partial dropper. He was in Punjab Engineering College, Chandigarh in the metallurgical and materials department before. I thought, should I go for this idea? (I went to Howrah from Pune (2000+ KM). I got admitted there. I went to the hostel (First time) and was scared, how could I live here and many thoughts came. Days went, I liked the college. Studied for Mid-Sem and End-sem examinations. I took participation in the events. I was living a great life there.One senior asked me ‚ÄúWhy you came here, that to from pune?‚ÄùI said ‚Äú I have a great interest in Aerospace‚ÄùHe laughed like hell. He said ‚ÄúI was also like you in the first year‚Äù.He then went from there leaving me blind in my thoughts. Mid-Sem exams were about to come. I ignored this incident and focused on studies. I was again in the flow of college life. It was 30th September (Last day applying for JEE Main January Attempt 2019).After some days past, I got to knew the reality of my Department in this college. Information about its condition, placements, and gathered all the info but I managed to live there, after all I am a student of that college. I was scared, because I wanted to study for JEE but haven‚Äôt studied not even a single letter. It was in December 2018, after End-Sem exams, it was winter break. I came to Pune. My father asked how‚Äôs preparation going on for JEE. I said the truth. I said I will not prepare, I will study aerospace there and I am fine. My father said this ‚ÄúI know you are not happy, you still have an option‚Äù. I thought a bit. I got emotional looking at my father.I remembered the days when I wanted to get admitted in IIT, the sacrifices my whole family did for the previous 2 years of preparation and faith from my mother at the time I took admission in FIITJEE in 2016! I was confused and Emotional + Scared.What to do now?I did‚Äônt studied anything for JEE and forgot what I studied in 2 years back as a gap 7 months was created. I decided to let go this and be at IIEST Shibpur. I went to IIEST-S on 31st Dec 2018 and reached there at night of 1st January 2019 ( Celebrated New Year in plane :)So, I reached my hostel room. 2nd sem was to start from 11th January.I had very less time to decide. I thought a lot. I directly went to Dean Office and said ‚ÄúI want to leave this college, how to do this‚Äù. He asked ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù. I said due to personal reasons.After a 7-Days procedure,(*IMP Note: In No means I mentioned IIEST is not good college. It‚Äôs a good College, but yes One must see the branch he is taking before going there)I came back to home now. Everyone was worried if I could clear JEE now in remaining time because I had not done any significant preparation in college. I had in total 3 Months for JEE Main and 4 Months for JEE Advanced (IITJEE 2019).When I came home, from the same day I started my Preparation for IITJEE 2019. But this time I studied very selectively and in the smartest way possible. I studied only the topics in which I was strong and which covered more than 70% of the syllabus before JEE Advanced 2019.I joined 2 Online Test Series vizI ignored this as I was preparing solely for JEE Advanced 2019. JEE Advanced was postponed because of elections in 2019 by 8 days. I got these 8 ‚ÄúGolden days‚Äù. I studied & revised to the peak of my level and beyond.You need to make short revision Maps for every Topic like this below (for Schrodinger Eq in Atomic Structure made by me) :On 27th May 2019, JEE Advanced was held.

For the very first time, I am living a disciplined life ( My Mom is particularly amazed). I wake up with a list of tasks in mind and sleep at night with satisfaction.Also , I've started valuing time more than ever .My schedule is something like this :4:155:00 - 7:45Doing Physics or Mathematics opens up my mind in the morning . I start with either of them based on what I feel like to do . That is followed by the other in Slot 2 .8:30- 11:0012:00 - 2: 303:00 - 6:307:15- 8:4510:15‚Äì4:15The time between these slots are breaks for Lunch , Rest (read surfing on Quora) , daily chores etc .I have been following this schedule for the past few months. I have been trying to push myself to do more - however, I am not able to do so as of now ( doesn't matter, I'll keep trying)My Current Laptop Wallpaper .I am currently enrolled in a coaching and also have the Unacademy Plus Subscription which I scarcely use , which I got as a prize for securing 14th Rank in Unacademy Prodigy Test ( they sent me an iPhone too :p?)I am currently using these books as a reference , keeping my coaching material as top priority .MathematicsI am not using those Olympiad books as of now , I solved them mostly in Class 9th and 10th .PhysicsI also received Bukhovstev yesterday but right now , it is in quarantine in my Mom‚Äôs safe vault . I really like solving Irodov - not because it is considered tough ( I think it's pretty basic ) but because of the pattern of questions .ChemistryPeople initially suggested me to buy N Awasthi and VK Jaiswal but I found Neeraj Kumar's level of questions much better while VJ Sir's book is almost the same level as VKJ but it has PYQs as well . That's why I chose them .And finally , some of myThe packages given in my coaching are really comprehensive . They are usually completed along with the chapter as the teachers give regular homework from them . It may not be a national level institute but believe me , I have seen Allen's and FIITJEE's material and ours have a mixture of questions from all of them .Currently , I have equal likeness for all the three subjects ( though I have special curiosity in Physics ) . I was initially apprehensive for Chemistry but have found it to be interesting as well ( people say I have not yet encountered the real face of Inorganic ) .I‚Äôve been practicing a lot ( at least that‚Äôs what I think ) . As of now , I find myself able to complete every chapter from material as well as above mentioned books . I have done my packages two to three times and for books and usually practice from one book when the chapter is ongoing and use another one for revision . For example , I did Quadratic equation from Package and Arihant when the chapter just finished and after 2‚Äì3 weeks , I did my package again and this time , practiced from Vikas Gupta‚Äôs Advanced Problems . One more thing , I have been collecting all the used pens .These are the number of pens I‚Äôve used in past 3‚Äì4 months . I thought it would be pretty amazing to look at the collection of pens ( signifying hard work ) two years later .I also make regular notes and revise them religiously daily after the classes get over .Inorganic chemistry Notes ( Chemical bonding )Maths and Physics NotebooksI also make short notes for revision .Atomic Structure Short NotesWell!

This way you would remain motivated to improve more and more.Preparation phase:First target chapters which require low input and give a high output.Some chapters like these are :Phy: Modern Physics, Gravitation, Errors and Instruments, Semiconductors,Communication systems and some topics like Carnot engineChem: metallurgy, surface chemistry, atomic structure etc.Maths: Stats, binomial, mathematical reasoning, coordinate geometry etc.Note: There are many chapters which can be categorized under this type but I have given some examples to explain what I mean.After you are done with this then target chapters with low input low output, high input high output and at the last with high input low output.Mock tests:This is a very crucial phase if you want to get a sub-1000 or a sub-500 finish in jee main. NTA has been conducting mains since 2019 with multiple shifts and there are already around 50‚Äì60 papers now and I think if you would only give them sincerely and analyse them, you will get to learn and improve a lot. Try to give mocks by recreating the exact exam-like atmosphere.Also, one important tip, try to reduce silly errors in jee mains because they can cost you a lot of marks as well as dip your rank considerably.

8,To be very honest. This is nearly impossible.On an average there are 30+ chapters to cover in each subject. That makes around 90 chapters and questions in Mains will be 75. To secure rank-1 you should have command over all the chapters such that you can do any questions spontaneously.If you are able to finish your practice test in 2:30 hours with maximum possible accuracy then you can say you can secure rank-1.

This is even more pronounced with statically typed languages where typechecking as an action is split from editing code. Again, you write some code and then typecheck it; if you have a type error you fix it and repeat, otherwise you're set.Of course, there are some pretty standard tools that are a bit more interactive. A REPL lets you load up some code, run snippets and inspect variables. A debugger lets you go through a computation step by step. An IDE can make error checking inline by highlighting broken code. However, all these are still pretty limited.At first, this is going to be primarily a UI/UX advancement. Bret Victor has a some talks like this, andI've even seen some cool interactive development support in Emacs:However, these tools are still very new. The actual user experience is still being developed, and the backends are still very primitive.Languages will also adapt to be more interactive. Haskell is already going in this direction, especially with ""type holes"". The idea is simple--instead of writing a part of your program, you can leave a ""hole"" there; the compiler can then tell you what type itIn the longer run, we'll see more advanced backend logic taking advantage of interactivity. For example, we could incorporate efficient search to interactively fill in parts of algorithms according to assertions. The programmer would guide the search by specifying some constraints, but the actual code would be produced by an algorithm. Consider various applications ofSo, my prediction: we will see a much more interactive programming environment coupled with sophisticated tools on the backend assisting the programmer",256 followers,Priyal Gupta,9.7K,0,0,2014,https://www.quora.com/Can-I-get-a-JEE-AIR-top-50-while-I-start-preparing-from-now-and-studying-efficiently-12-hours-per-day-When-will-the-JEE-Mains-2022-be-conducted

28,The most common failure idea is the idea of doing multiple ideas at once.  A large number of start-ups are guilty of this.  They take on many loosely tied ideas at once and solve multiple problems at once.  They do an OK job solving many problems rather than a great job solving just one problem.Lack of focus is a great way of doing a lot of cool things but no great things.A start-up should be radically focused on one core thing and everyone in the company should be working on just that one thing.

Brin and Page are young, smart and ambitious, and they‚Äôre the founders, which doesn‚Äôt apply to the leadership of Apple and Microsoft. I explain the importance of thisIn Google‚Äôs early days, they set out to dominate search without knowing how they‚Äôd make money. AdWords wasn‚Äôt as obvious then as it is now. But Brin and Page knew all along that if they could dominate search they‚Äôd monetise somehow.And that has been how they‚Äôve approached everything they‚Äôve gone into. They don‚Äôt care about the money as the money will eventually come when they dominate.Chromebook, Android, Google Docs, YouTube, Gmail, their leadership in self-driving cars are all seeds that Google have planted, that will make them huge returns at some point. They‚Äôre patient.I mean, despite going in well after Apple into the smartphone arena, they now run 82% of the world‚Äôs smartphones. An absolutely incredible achievement.

They jump from one idea to the next, and never stick to something long enough to reap the rewards. To make things worse, they are constantly looking for the next great thing and want to start too many companies at once.And even if they did stick to one idea, most entrepreneurs give up on it as soon as things get hard. A few months go by, and then they move onto the next shiny object. It‚Äôs a never-ending cycle. They lose focus and never stick it out.What‚Äôs the greatest advice for a young entrepreneur?Stick to one idea long enough with insane focus, and you will ultimately win.","68,773 followers",Kanthaswamy Balasubramaniam,1.9K,17.3K,413.3M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Can-I-get-a-JEE-AIR-top-50-while-I-start-preparing-from-now-and-studying-efficiently-12-hours-per-day-When-will-the-JEE-Mains-2022-be-conducted
