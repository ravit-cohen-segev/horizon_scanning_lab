It needs to economies of scale to bring the costs down, sometimes the sources of the materials needed don’t exist, and sometimes there simply isn’t a market for it until someone big gets behind it. You can see this all the time when people whine when Apple introduces something that other people did it first, but it wasn’t a mass market product until Apple did it.GenerallyHow far behind are we, the consumers, in terms of the technology made available to us?3–5 years.Not because of some nefarious plot to keep consumers back, but because technology exists that isn’t viable as a consumer product.

1,"No.A sexbot is a masturbation toy. People have been masturbating since the dawn of time. It hasn’t stopped them from having real relationships with actual people.In fact, I think sexbots might make relationships easier and more common. If the kind of man who thinks the only thing women are good for is being a receptacle for his dick gets a sexbot and stays home masturbating with it, perhaps women will find it easier to locate decent partners. By self-selecting themselves out of the social arena, those men will make it easier for women to avoid them.Just a thought.",469 followers,Daniel Cohort,11.9K,377,1.2M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Do-you-think-the-development-of-new-technology-will-slow-down-at-some-point-Will-consumers-be-satisfied-with-the-current-technology-or-is-it-human-nature-to-continually-want-change-What-impact-does-desire-for-new
2,"I think this question is not worded correctly. This is really about whether sex robots will replace women as sexual partners. The answer to this question is that some female sexual partners could be replaced by high quality robots. But not all. On the other hand, some men might be also replaced by robots as well.I think sex robots would be great for shy introvert men who are currently unable to get dates in the Western World. Their only option right now are Sex Workers or their right hand. Sex robots could offer a good alternative… They could give this man an opportunity to have their physicalI think this question is not worded correctly.

Their only option right now are Sex Workers or their right hand. Sex robots could offer a good alternative… They could give this man an opportunity to have their physical needs met while not risking STDs or breaking the law (in some Western countries). That could make them more confident in meeting quality women.I think attractive, fit, caring women who have not been poisoned by feminism have nothing to worry about from the Robots. On the other hand, Gold diggers, feminist man haters, women who use sex as a barter to get expensive gifts might start struggling. Who needs then when you could spend time with a quality Sex bot.I am personally looking forward to the time when I can buy or rent high quality Sex Robot…",4 followers,Leon Brennan,24.9K,693,21.5M,2021,https://www.quora.com/With-the-eventual-rise-of-sexbot-technology-will-developed-countries-see-serious-population-dips-in-the-future-if-this-technology-becomes-affordable
