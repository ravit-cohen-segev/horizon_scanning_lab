Personal reflection is used by multiple types of people for a wide variety of reasons:People use personal reflection to help with their daily lives. For example, a man who is struggling financially may choose to start a small business and reflect upon the qualities of his previous ventures in order to better prepare for this new one.This technology is also used by people who have no financial struggles in order to better understand their own personal values, desires and motivations. This is useful for helping people make decisions about how they wish to live their lives.Personal reflection aids individuals in becoming more self-aware, which is important for people with and without financial struggles. It can also help people better understand their own emotions and desires.Personal reflection is the primary reason why many people choose to engage in therapy. This kind of reflection serves as a method for helping individuals better understand their own feelings, desires and motivations.","358,978 followers",Sean Kernan,9.1K,5.6K,727M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Is-personal-reflection-an-emerging-technology

And choosing a career in these domains should be more about your interests than simply joining the bandwagon. If joining the bandwagon is the intent, AI wins handsdown as a recent survey conducted by IIT Madras in collaboration with Office of Principal Scientific Advisor to PM shows. The survey indicated 43% of Indian respondents perceiving AI as the big bet while Quantum computing trails a distant second and technology like 5G is languishing in single digits of public perception.The perception may not be the truth and it maybe deceptive.For starters, AI seems the most attractive due to its potential to replace human mental intervention by emulating the nature's most amazing creation - human brain.However, much of our daily function of brain is dependent on memory and prior experiences which makes Data a vital component of AI.The explosion of Data creation has to lead to a corresponding expansion in Data Science in order to makes sense of it. While Data Science will feed patterns and structure into AI, cybersecurity is no less important. At the end of the day, any ecosystem will not sustain until the credibility and fidelity of systems aren't guaranteed and cybersecurity will emerge as an important factor.Regardless of Data Scientist to feed into AI or cybersecurity experts to keep the ecosystem safe, it's User experiences which will ultimately drive demand. The coolest technology will need to have an equally cool front end design aka User Interface or the whole technology may fall flat. True that Facebook today has massive Network effect but it's equally true that a lousy interface can alienate users to other platforms in a matter of weeks or months. It's UX which enhances user experience and ensures loyalty towards a brand of product or service.What about cloud or 5G you may say. Cloud is just ""other person's computer"" while 5G is mostly about higher speed and better infrastructure.It's UX design which will be the new customer experience touch point, AI - the new employee, Data - the new oil and Cybersecurity - the new policeman.",8 followers,Vignesh War,47.5K,81,980.1K,2021,https://www.quora.com/Is-personal-reflection-an-emerging-technology
3,"Technologies by themselves are not as relevant as the scale and cost at which the applications of technology can be adopted in India.For example, Its not stand-alone AI as much as its application to a specific area within agri that matters. We are currently seeing opportunities where an agri-bot learns from a crop data set that has had virus attacks and the visual engine can render where these attacks are on the farm and limit a sharp pesticide spraying on that narrow area, saving costs, improving health, relative to older practices that were manual and expensive in both costs and quality.

This is the applied innovation thinking we need at massive scale in India.Given the government push to Electric Vehicles, all associated technologies are bound to erupt, including material sciences and storage related to batteries.(Just this morning, the news flashes seem to suggest the versatile Essel Group of Zee TV fame, under Subhash Chandra, seems to be doubling down on this space)Applied Robotics and Automation within more traditional industries including manufacturing and Agriculture is something we see as inevitable for an India that has to achieve hyper growth.We continue to believe that India is an applied market where technology needs to be an enabler in solving day to day needs of education, healthcare, financial services, commerce, media and delivering each of these at the best prices in the world is where innovation will be focused on – not necessarily the underlying tech. Innovation can be price: value innovation and that drives Indian market adoption more than pure technological impetus.","84,238 followers",Igor Markov,3.3K,3.9K,49.8M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Is-personal-reflection-an-emerging-technology

9,We do have a situation where the west can lose its technological edge. What we are really talking about is a control of the economy. The way the international economy works is by giving the price setters negotiating advantage to those who produce cutting edge technology. This was the forte of the West until now. This was often seen as the way the west managed to continue the economic colonialism. This way the west sees China as a challenge.,UNKNOWN,Titus,1.1K,453,1.3M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Which-emerging-technologies-are-poised-to-have-the-greatest-impact-in-India

By that logic, the constant evolution of technology has always been disruptive and has done away with the status quo.Understandably, evolution always brings up specific areas of concern. CIOs have always been worried about storage facilities as well as security. With the evolution of IoT, it has become more crucial to understand these two aspects; issues that are discussed over this article.Addressing these issues, firstly it is vital to recognize the exact difficulties. These define the strategies that must be formulated.What exactly are the worries?Various businesses have differing priorities. The most commonly shared ones are the following.·The vast quantity of data that can be generated with IoT is a major issue for CIOs. While on one hand, it is difficult to process such lengthy data, it is also difficult to store them.·Along with storage comes the question of security. While a vast amount of data gets accumulated, storing them safely is imperative especially since it contains private information.·Processing of data is a major concern. But this can be further broken down into minute issues like transfer, assimilation, categorising and then finally processing it.·The difficulty in processing has another problem with it. It can become increasingly difficult, or at least a lengthy process to identify the actual problem. In statistical terms, this is the opinion of around 73% of CIOs.·Almost 75% of CIOs also believe that IoT providers might hide the original issues from them, just to uphold the image of upgraded service.·In terms of speculation, CIOs are also worried that IoT is almost about to surpass human processing speeds. In simpler terms, IoT delivered data which is already difficult to process will become even more difficult, leading to a decrease in user efficiency rather than increasing it.A simple example from the automotive industry would be that of IoT implementation in cars. More than 20-25 GB of data gets accumulated for just about an hour of driving. Along with storing this data safely, processing and using it for better functioning becomes extremely difficult for CIOs.While these are issues faced directly by CIOs, they also expect a few problems for users. These must also be recognized.One issue is that tracking application or software behavior while the IoT device interacts with cloud services might be difficult for users, especially with the faster and higher volume of data.There is another issue too- that of updates. Malfunction of updates and software patches can be detrimental to the use of apps and software which are connected by IoT.Strategizing is the basic step any CIO can take in handling the upcoming issues of IoT evolution. Consequently, they should consider the questions below while formulating their strategy at handling the oncoming issues.1.2.3.4.5.6.With different networks being implemented, the interaction between multiple devices and systems has led to even further difficulties, and opportunities, for CIOs. As the expected step of evolution, it is paramount for CIOs to formulate strict plans to cope with this evolving IoT.","47,054 followers",Abhinav Sharma,3.5K,865,7.1M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Is-personal-reflection-an-emerging-technology

This is not future for them, this is already current. Except, they probably don’t have an album of our private moments. And I don’t think it is far from near future.PlaytestNo matter how old people become or how ever many generations prosper, playing games is a never ending craving. No wonder we went from playing with stones and sticks to virtual reality games. This is one industry that thrives big time, irrespective of holiday discounts or black Friday deals. With this madness, it won’t be a surprise for me if a hardcore gamer has already been a victim like the one in this episode.Shut Up and DanceHonestly, I am constantly in fear of such kind of privacy breaches already. Surrounded by so many electronic devices at home, privacy is getting more and more at risk by the day. But then again, all those devices are at home for a reason, a comfortable, easy access reason and most of us have adapted to this. I can see this episode coming to reality very soon. All I can do is hope that it doesn’t.Okay, those were my fears of technology becoming a nightmare, especially after we have been warned by Black Mirror.Fin.",18 followers,Asim Qureshi,17K,996,156.1M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Is-personal-reflection-an-emerging-technology
