If we want to survive that long on earth, our best move might well be to invest a sliver of our total expenses on Mars pioneering.It's easy to press your nose up against your favorite crises until they're all you can see, and think it unconscionable not to spend all available resources on that problem directly.   But the best solution to a persistent problem is almost never the most obvious solution.  If it were, the problem wouldn't be persistent.  I doubt that many people in 1960 could imagine how much the birth control pill would reduce the portion of children living in extreme poverty over the next 55 years.  I doubt anyone on earth imagined that a single agronomist in the American midwest would save a billion lives tinkering with rice genes.   If you'd like more examples than these two, I'm sure I could supply another thousand.Also, you say it lacks livable conditions and resources?  It has every element needed to sustain life, in a workable temperature band.

Inequality will always persist in one form or another. There will always be the more, and the less fortunate. We can devote some time and effort to it, but our ultimate goal must always be the progress of humanity as a whole.I'll let you define human 'progress' on your own.

Maybe Banner told Cap about Thanos’ four children but I’m not sure Cap explained all these details to T’challa; at least until they landed. Because immediately they landed, the very first thing T’challa did was ask this question:He needed intel, he needed something to work with, but unfortunately, all he got was a flaky, non-actionable answer; “a very big assault”. But truthfully, what intel did we have on Thanos? Nothing more than he’s truly bad and has four badass children. Maybe they did brief T’challa on this offscreen, so judging by that, do you think he was wrong to assemble the army he assembled? He had no intelligence on these guys, no assessments, no power levels. So he brought what he expected would have been enough to stop four really powerful guys. He didn’t know Thanos was coming with the kind of army he showed up with.So, from the start, T’challa was already doing the best anybody could have. So now, the fight came. Wakanda’s early warning systems detected Thanos’ ship enter the atmosphere. A big ship that dispatched smaller ships. Smaller ships that are as tall as mountains! Based on this new intel, what did T’challa do? He gave these new orders:He realized that this situation was way bigger than anything he has prepared for. He knows that even at that point; he does not have the basic parameters he needs. But he did what every good king will do, he gave the command to evacuate the city. Even though he does not know what he is pitted up against, he can tell, judging by the sizes of those ships that things can take a very wild turn, and as such he needed to prioritize the safety of his people. He said they should evacuate the city and engage all defenses. I believe what he was talking about here was the city’s defenses.What happened next? They went down to the battlefield. T’challa had his army stay inside the dome, which was strong enough to tank the full force of one of those outrider ships. Even with that protection, he had soldiers from the border tribe stand in front of the entire army, with their shields activated. Then behind them, everybody had sonic cannons; cannons powerful enough to stop a tank! Even if it was, this was the United States of America, this would have been enough to hold them, and bear in mind, T’challa probably thought he was fighting four guys.Then the fight started. The Outriders were sent out. Now, I want you to take a few seconds to think about these guys. They’re unlike any army anybody has faced. I think they are genetically modified, they have no emotions, they're just objects of destruction. No fear, no pain, not thoughts. Heck, some of them hit the dome with so much force that they fell dead flat! Watch that scene closely. Even those that got there safely didn’t mind killing themselves trying to get in. It was as if they were happy doing it, circling the dome, trying to get a chance to kill themselves.And there was not just a few of these things. There were thousands of them on the ground, plus probably thousands more in the ships. Imagine what that kind of sight does to the morale of an army; imagine a fight against uncountable thousands of these mindless beasts. How do you plan for that kind of battle? How do you win that?Now, some got in, T’challa ordered a strike. Remember, these hand cannons are powerful enough to stop a tank. But what did they do? Almost nothing. It was killing some of them but more kept coming. Now, this is the part where most people say War Machine put up a beautiful display. Yes, I agree. It was a beautiful display of fireworks. But What did it really do? Not that much. While it did kill some, if you watch closely, you’ll see that quite a lot of them ran through the fire and kept coming! Even, as far as I can see, Sam’s redwing did not get any kill. So, it was not a question of Wakanda’s firepower. It was more about who and what they were pitted up against. At this point, T’challa had to change his strategy, these things were coming in from all points of the dome and they had Vision behind them. Also, remember that these things could get into the city, with evacuations in progress and all. So he opened the barrier and went out to face these things in hand-to-hand combat, which he knew his soldiers were more than capable of. I mean, if guns and cannons can't take them down effectively, then we’ll do it with our hands and judging from the number of Wakanda soldiers left standing after the fight, they did just that.Some may argue, why didn’t T’challa call an airstrike? Why didn't he bring in the airforce? Well, you know these things take time to scramble. It takes time for these forces to respond. Also, remember he ordered an evacuation, isn’t it possible that they used their air force for that? The airforce did show up, towards the end of the fight, trying to blow up the outrider ships.The sheer number of these outriders and their genetics made it seem otherwise, but Wakanda did pretty good with this battle, and judging from the fact that the ground was not filled with Wakandan bodies, judging from the fact that they were able to hold thousands of outsiders, in hand to hand combat until Thor arrived and even after he did means you don’t want to trifle with these guys.So, Wakanda did very well, playing the cards they’ve been dealt. Holding thousands of suicide-enjoying beasts, even though they had no previous intel on them.Wakanda Forever!",0 followers,Michael DiLillo,2.7K,532,1.9M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Why-are-we-wasting-so-much-time-and-money-trying-to-send-a-human-to-Mars-it-lacks-livable-conditions-and-resources

All Thanos needed to do was get the last stone, and he did that. But to do so, he sacrificed all of his most trusted and valuable lieutenants, lost most of his ground forces, and almost died. But Wakanda is still standing. It lost it’s monarch, but we still don’t know if Shuri is still alive, their infrastructure wasn’t that badly damaged (at least as far as I could see).If Thanos’ mission was to destroy Wakanda, however, I don’t care how great a tactician T’Challa is, that Gauntlet would have blown it away like matchsticks (literally, if Thanos decided to use the Reality Stone to transform it into matchsticks). He could have used the Mind Stone to enslave the population, or the Space Stone to teleport them to the Moon, or the Soul Stone to bring back their ancestors to fight them. He could have used the Time Stone to turn it to ancient rubble, or the Power Stone to simply annihilate it. Wakanda is lucky it wasn’t Thanos’ primary target.All that aside, it never would have happened anyway, because Thanos’ biggest weakness is that he always leaves a route to victory for his opponents. In the comics, it has been mentioned several times that Thanos always leaves the key to his undoing within reach. “Warlock reveals that Thanos has always allowed himself to be defeated because the Titan secretly knows he is not worthy of ultimate power.” - From the Thanos Wikipedia page (see link below)Thanos - Wikipedia","18,451 followers",Nathan Stanish,12.5K,2.3K,62.5M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Why-are-we-wasting-so-much-time-and-money-trying-to-send-a-human-to-Mars-it-lacks-livable-conditions-and-resources

They were ready for a fight, but not a giant fight with a full beserk battalion with it’s own armor (giant spinning wheels of death) mowing through the field.They had something of a plan, which is why it was working until the numbers started to stack against them. You can have plenty of advanced technology, but if it isn’t designed to take out very large amounts of enemies at once, then a sizeable enough force will always win out eventually. This was true of real life warfare as well. When the machine gun was first invented it absolutely devastated the battlefield. But through enough bodies at it and they eventually took them out. The same is true of tanks. The same is true of vibranium spears that can do a limited scope of effect and only throw two or three bodies at a time. Eventually, a force of tens of thousands is going to overwhelm your meager thousands, even with the remaining Avengers afoot. Thor was in his element and tearing apart dozens at a time, but it still might have overwhelmed him over time. Afterall, this battle was just a distraction.The real goal was Vision. A lot of battles were also decided in history by the decisive victory of taking out the goal, often the leader of whatever country or force with one soldier or a very small dedicated group. The giant battle outside threatened the lives of civilians, yes, but for Thanos’ purposes it tied up the Avengers. If not for the warning that Vision was in trouble, Cap and Wanda wouldn’t have shown up to try and help. They would have been too caught up in fighting the battle. Why not leave a guard? They did. And she went to help in the battle instead.The technology may be advanced, but no plan is perfect. Hasty ones even less so.

It was only to defend that particular place for as long as possible. It wasn't a true battle as the Black Order could just throw Outriders for as long as they wanted.Secondly the shield that Wakanda uses was breached incredibly easily. Firstly by opening it to try and funnel Outriders through a bottle neck and secondly by those huge wheel machines that dug under them and ripped them apart. The shield will have been a large part of the plan.The plan would have been tactically sound. Keep Shuri and Vision safe. Scarlett Witch (Who remember is quite possibly one of the most powerful Avengers, yeah She is squishy but She destroyed an Infinity Stone, with one hand behind Her back, which was holding off Thanos with 5 Infinity Stones. Not to mention that She was killing the person She loved at the same time. Forget Captain Marvel.) Was acting as the last line of defence. Captain America, Black Panther, the remaining Avengers and the Wakandan Army, aided by the Border Tribes and M'Baku would keep the attention of the Black Order.Remember it's tower defence not a War. If the Stone is removed and destroyed the Avengers Win. If The Black Order get the Stone the Avengers lose. It's about holding them off not killing them all or demoralising them.The problem started when the Avengers started to lose steam and Wanda went to help them. That was the Black Orders plan. Get Wanda away from Vision. She nearly stopped them even after they surprised attacked the pair in Edinbrough. With her out of the way Corvous Glaive should be able to take Shuri and the injured Vision. He didn't count on the Dore Milaji being so badass so was held up enough for Vision to throw himself and Glave out the window.It was two sets of tactics put up against each other, The Black Order ‘cheated' by implying Glave was dead. If Thor, Teenage Groot and Rabbitt had arrived earlier, meaning Wanda could have stayed with Vision it could have been different.The out of Universe answer is that someone at Marvel or Disney felt we needed an Epic Battle and so one was added when we probably didn't need one.

The Outriders were never anything more than bullet catchers to Thanos, and the Dora Milaje, Wakandan Royal Guards, Border Tribe, and Jabari Tribe ripped them to shreds.If you look at the battle itself, independent of the effects of the “snapture,” Wakanda won quite decisively. Had the snap not occurred, T’Challa would have been only half right when he said “The heroes only “lost” in the context of Thanos getting the Mind Stone and initiating the snap (which I needn’t remind you killed half of Thanos’ allies, as well as half of his opponents).The Avengers “lost” the war (until next month), but they decisively won that battle.As to why they “lost” the war, the in-universe explanation is that they had to. We’ll know the exact details why at shortly after midnight on April 25th, but Doctor Strange made it clear that this is the only path that will lead to ultimate victory. They had to “lose” that one time in order to “win” later.In fact, it just occurred to me, that puts the flashback montage (baseball, go carts, bike jump) of Captain Marvel into perspective. “Standing back up again” after a failure is a heroic act.The ultimate heroic act, actually.If you don’t get knocked down, you can’t get back up again.

It was decades ahead of the Russians in missiles, fighter planes, tanks and almost all other military technologies. China had only just begun breaking from its dependency on Russia for military technology, designing its own systems, but China was still decades behind the US. Unrivaled systems like the F-22 and Arleigh Burke Class Destroyers were symbolic of the perceived invincibility of the US military.F-22Following the 9/11 attacks, the US’s decision to respond in Afghanistan was totally understandable. Sensing pent up grief over the attacks that challenged the nation’s sense of invincibility, the Bush administration decided to capitalize on these sentiments to push another war, one with Iraq. Although at one point Iraq had the 4th largest standing army in the world, Saddam Hussein had largely been defanged following the first Gulf War. The Iraqis were no longer a threat to anyone following their humiliating defeat at the hands of the Americans in 1991. While there is much speculation about what the real motivation of the Bush administration was, everything from controlled chaos to oil profits, the US really did not have a justification invading Iraq. To justify the war, the US relied on fabricated intelligence regarding Iraq’s chemical weapons program.Colin Powell making the case for the Invasion of Iraq before the UNThe US’s initial invasion of Iraq was lightly opposed. US armored spearheads were able to quickly advance on Baghdad and other major cities. Meanwhile the USAF launched “Shock and Awe” attacks to destroy Iraqi infrastructure and disrupt the central government’s control over the country. In less than a month, the US was able to seize total control over the country. During the invasions, the US only took a few hundred casualties, while the Iraqis defending their country took as many as 10,000 killed in action. However, the US was unprepared for the aftermath of the invasion.US Soldiers Tear Down a Statue of Saddam HusseinFollowing the invasion, the US military, CIA and State Department were tasked with rebuilding the Iraqi government in aUS Troops in IraqThe US military would spend the 8 years following the invasion trying to put out of the Iraqi civil war. At various times the US military found itself engaged virtually all of the different sides in the civil war. The US was forced to spend considerable effort pacifying the Sunni Triangle, fighting Saudi-backed insurgents in cities like Mosul and Fallujah. In the Shiite-dominated cities like Baghdad, the US battled Iranian-backed groups like the Sadr militia. As the war dragged on, the US was increasingly forced to divert funds from defense acquisition projects designed to deter near-peer states to fund the war effort in Iraq. Instead of developing systems like guided missiles to deter Russia and China, the US was forced to purchase MRAPs in an effort to reduce casualties from IEDs.US MRAP in IraqWhile the US was engaged in Iraq, the Russian government was able to capitalize off of high oil prices to fund a number of defense projects that had been stalled since the end of the Cold War that were specifically designed to counter the US’s advantages, specifically the USAF. The Russians finished developing and began producing cruise missiles like the Kh-101 and the Kalibr family. Russia began to field the Iskander tactical, ballistic missile, designed to knock out US air defenses, command posts and air bases. The S-400 air defense system was designed specifically to counter the American cruise missiles and the US’s fleet of stealth aircraft.S-400 and Pantsir Air Defense SystemsAlthough the US withdrew from Iraq in 2011, the US would remain focused on similar conflicts like Libya, Syria and Afghanistan for years to come. Only when Russia directly challenged the US in Syria did the US begin to realize what the Russians had spent the past decade developing. However, by then it was too late. Russia had leapfrogged the US in missile technology while the US was focused on counterinsurgency in the Middle East. By 2013, Russia had already the systems developed to knock out the US’s airbases in Europe, securing air superiority for the Russian Air Force. By invading Iraq, the US allowed Russia to surpass its once invincible military in many key technologies. While at the start of the 21st century, the US military was widely regarded as invincible, the US gave up this lead by taking its eye off the ball.Russian Iskander","16,063 followers",Pavel Fekula,2.7K,11K,118.6M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-do-you-think-are-the-main-advantages-and-disadvantages-of-teaching-with-technologies

But they didn’t actively engage the German Army along the Franco-German border. They were content to sit back and await an offensive move by the Germans and thus ceded almost all the initiative to Germany.Now there was some cause for waiting. The French Army was starting to field relatively dominant anti-tank guns that were being introduced. Their armored forces were fielding tanks that would make life difficult for German Panzers as well. The RAF and French Air Force weren’t yet ready to take on the Luftwaffe either. So I am not one to demand the Allies leap across the border here. There are good reasons not to do it.But if you are going to fight on the defensive you need a solid plan for it. And the Allied plan was poorly conceived and even more poorly implemented.The allies expected a mechanized reprise of the Schleiffen Plan from WWI.Indeed this wasn’t insane. It was in fact the original German plan. There is a relatively famous incident where those plans fell into allied hands through a plane crash. This promoted Germany to at least consider changing them but no one had a real good alternative until Erich Von Manstein rolled through Berlin on his way to being shipped off to the East for being a pain in the ass and showed Hitler an alternative which we will get to.Now the Allies believed the attack would come through Belgium. So what was their plan?Basically it was to do this. Roll forward with their best armies and a large percentage of their armor and keep the fighting off of French soil. Most French military decisions were based on this in the whole of the interwar period. It’s understandable but would lead to some bad decisions.In essence French high command committed all of its mobile forces to this movement towards the Dyle River. What was left south of the Meuse River was substantially an infantry heavy force. South of Sedan you basically had immobile fortress divisions in the Maginot Line.The biggest problem is that this was basically just “the plan”. When the Germans show up in Belgium this is what we will do. High command didn’t really have another plan of any sort. Nor did they really seem to make much effort to establish the exact nature of the German attack nor the units it was composed of. Was it a powerful attack? Sure. But the Allies didn’t identify that roughly 50% more troops and fully 70% or more of the German armored forces were not with a Army Group B going into Belgium but were with Army Group A poised to head for Sedan.They made a classic and avoidable blunder. They had an idea of what the Germans would do, saw what they expected to see and reacted accordingly. The proper course would have been to exercise patience and trade space in Belgium and possibly Northern France for time to determine the exact nature of the attack.Instead France committed all of its mobile troops effectively leaving itself no reserve to react if the Germans made a move elsewhere as they would. And this is the result.Because the Allies never really considered the possibility that the Germans would do something else they come crashing out of the Ardennes and cut off the best parts of the French and British armies leaving them to be squeezed to death.This to me is the single most costly mistake in modern warfare. French armored forces would have been more than technically capable of causing many problems for German Panzers. Had the Allies simply held their mobile forces back until German intentions were clear they are sitting directly in the way of Army’s Group A. Instead they guessed at German intentions and lost the continent of Europe in the process.The Allies would have been better off had they simply been given no orders what so ever for 48 hours after the Germans rolled into Belgium. There are very few circumstances where a sides chances are measurably better had they simply elected to do nothing. This is one of those. And the cost was horrible for everyone involved.","4,917 followers",Jane Urresti,1K,71,3.6M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Why-are-we-wasting-so-much-time-and-money-trying-to-send-a-human-to-Mars-it-lacks-livable-conditions-and-resources

I think enough time has passed that I can tell the story without the black helicopters flying over my house (peers nervously out the window).It was January, 1991, Desert Shield was about to turn into Desert Storm, and I was still working as a medic in a major Army medical center. We had lost several of our medics and nurses to the build up for the war and we knew we were going to lose more personnel. The decision was madeDuring my time in the Army I saw a lot of mistakes, as has anyone who has ever served, but this one took the cake. It was FUBAR (F´d up beyond all recognition) as they come. I think enough time has passed that I can tell the story without the black helicopters flying over my house (peers nervously out the window).It was January, 1991, Desert Shield was about to turn into Desert Storm, and I was still working as a medic in a major Army medical center. We had lost several of our medics and nurses to the build up for the war and we knew we were going to lose more personnel. The decision was made to call in an Army Reserve unit to replace those who had deployed.It seemed reasonable at the time. The surrounding Reserve units were all examined, and there was one nearby with around fifty medics. Perfect. We´ll call them up, they will come and replace those we have lost and life will hum right along.Yeah, right.This is the Army. Nothing ever hums right along.The people in charge made the calls they needed to get this done, and I was told to report to the front of the hospital where the reservists were due to arrive.As NCO of the Infection Control Department, my job was to give them classes on how to wash their hands, how to put on PPE (things that the entire world is learning now), etc. Basically, how not to infect our patients.Easy peasy.I stood next to the Command Sergeant Major (CSM) awaiting Reserve unit 5311 (not the actual numbers, less to protect the innocent, and more because I don´t really remember them). Arrangements had been made for housing in the barracks, food, etc. Everything fifty people would ever need.They finally arrived. They began coming, and coming, and coming…. Soon the area in front of the hospital was full of people, and still they continued to come. We moved them onto the grass (yes, they stood on the sergeant major´s grass), and still more arrived.I glanced at the CSM, “What the f—k!” He muttered, shocked. Soon we had almost two thousand people on the grass in front of the hospital. The Reservist sergeant major reported to ours.“Reserve unit 1135 reporting for duty, sergeant major.” He said crisply.WTF!Some dyslexic clerk somewhere in the invisible Army chain of command had accidentally called up the wrong reserve unit. This was the unit based out of Raleigh, North Carolina whose job was to take over our ENTIRE hospital in the case of WWIII when the Russians invaded Western Europe (yeah, we still thought it could happen).Boy, we must have looked stupid. The entire upper level NCO cadre standing there with their mouths hanging open catching microscopic flies in the Georgia heat.The sergeant major recovered quickly. “Welcome to our hospital.”A million thoughts were running through our heads. What were we going to do with all these people? We expected fifty, not the invasion force at Normandy.Out of the corner of my eye, I saw the major general of the hospital coming out of the front doors to greet the newcomers. I had talked to him on several occasions and he was a very low key, soft spoken guy.He stared at the thousands of people trampling his grass, his eyes widening in shock. From where I was standing, I could clearly read his lips as he uttered the same three words as the CSM.He quickly strode up and exchanged some whispers with the CSM. They both looked a bit dazed. What were we going to do with all these people? We didn´t have room in our barracks for them to sleep, or food, or jobs for that matter. The logical solution was to apologize, tell them a huge mistake had been made, sorry you left your jobs, family, lives, but oops, sh-t happens, and send them home.But that was never going to happen. This was the military. They don´t make mistakes. And if they do, they certainly don´t own up to them.The reservists milled around, looking nervous and exhausted and hungry. To his credit, the CSM collected himself and made quite a convincing welcome speech. He then turned it over to the General while he hightailed back to his office, telling his clerk to start making phone calls.Within an hour arrangements had been made with every hotel in the town, giving them a bed to sleep in at least for one night. Food delivery was set up, and everyone pitched in to take them to the hotels, buses, trucks, even POVs (privately owned vehicles) were commandeered to drive them off the base.Emergency meetings were held after they left.“We have to send them home. We can´t keep them here. There´s no room, and we’ll be tripping over them in the hospital.” It was a reasonable suggestion.The CSM shook his head. “You don´t understand, we can´t send them home. It was a mistake. Not our mistake, but we own it now.”After an hour of back and forth negotiations, a PFC knocked on the door.“Come in!” The CSM bellowed, frustrated at the situation.The private opened the door timidly. “Um, sergeant major?”“What is it, private?”“The reserve unit from Puerto Rico just arrived. They apologized that their plane was delayed. Where do you want me to put them?”The sergeant major looked like his head was about to blow off. “Puerto Rico? Oh my God! Can this sh-t get any worse?”“We have to tell them.” The other NCO’s said. “They’re going to figure it out soon enough. Since when does the Army put you up in a hotel and let you order room service?”“No.” The CSM said firmly. “I´ve been a soldier in this man´s Army since 1962 and if I’ve learned anything it is this: you make a little mistake, you own up to it, take your punishment like a man, and drive on. You make an epic FU, you deny, deny, deny, and do everything you can to make it go away.”“But we didn´t do anything wrong. We told them the correct unit to call up.” They insisted.“Yes, but this screw up is way above me. If I admit it, if I expose it, then it will all be on me. Mine will be the head to roll, and I like my head exactly where it is and plan on keeping it there. I heard Alaska is cold in January.” He explained.“So what do you want us to do?”“Cover it up and make it disappear.” He said, the wheels in his head visibly turning.And that´s what they did.Within a week, we had chosen two hundred reservists who would be staying with us. The rest had to go. Where? Anywhere. They shipped some off to Saudi Arabia, to go to war with Iraq. The rest were “disappeared” throughout the country.I had the dubious honor of being one of the NCO´s who got to read off their new orders while standing outside on the sad, trampled grass, since we didn´t have any area inside big enough to hold all of them at once.One by one, we called off their names and yelled where they would be going. They came up and took their new orders out of our hands.No one went to Hawaii.They sent them to some of the worst, most remote bases they could find.Ft. Polk, Louisiana - maybe hoping they would be eaten by the gators.Ft. Irwin, California - a lovely sandy spot in the middle of the Mojave Desert.And so it went. Reading names and cringing at the thought of where we were sending them, all because of a clerical error.Of the two hundred or so who ended up staying with us, they still needed to live in hotels, eat take out pizza and, oh yes, not get paid for three months. Since they were never supposed to be called up, no one was prepared to pay them for their service.While the Army tried to straighten it all out, the reservists lost their jobs, couldn´t pay their mortgages, had their homes foreclosed, their spouses divorced them, it was tragic.I began wondering if I was going to have to go home and whip up some chocolate chip muffins to sell at a base bake sale just to raise some money to pay them.Despite daily irate phone calls to their congressmen, senators, and any other political representative they could think of, the weeks dragged on with no money in sight. No one was willing to own up to this. The reservists threatened to go AWOL and go home.“Come and arrest me!” They cried, furious at the treatment.I think some people were hoping they would just run away and take the problem off our hands. But none did.Finally, they played their trump card (No, not that Trump, Bush Sr. was in the WH).They threatened to call CNN and go public with the whole sordid mess.That did it. Three days later, miraculously they got paid. CNN had more power than a senator.Wait, I think I hear the helicopters now….","2,300 followers",Donovan Walls,12.6K,268,10.2M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Why-did-Wakanda-fall-so-easily-in-Avengers-Infinity-War-when-Black-Panther-is-possibly-the-greatest-tactician-on-Earth-and-Wakanda-is-the-most-technologically-advanced-nation

Concurrent with the advancements in stealth were generational jumps in AESA radars, electro-optical and IR imaging systems, EW and ECM measures, and networking capabilities. Add aircraft engine advancements. And much more.The Russian late start on stealth has cost them untold billions upon billions in hidden costs to attempt to match the American aircraft. China too. And more billions and billions spent on attempts to counter them. Factor in tens of billions in lost foreign sales. No current export market for Sukhoi's eventual production of the Su-57.The fact that many countries are investing in stealth technology strongly suggests that they see obvious limitations to the much - hyped capabilities of Russian systems like the the S-400. An effective deterrent to most 4th Gen aircraft. And less so for advanced US VLO stealth aircraft.Moving forward, fighters with VLO stealth properties and highly advanced sensors will have an advantage over fighters from opposition forces which lack VLO signatures.Russia's claim that their AEGIS like S-400 system is the antidote for stealth blows up in the face of their efforts to produce a high-level stealth aircraft. And that a country which developed stealth technology isnt capable of producing any radar systems that Russia can. That's magical thinking.Other countries including the UK, Japan, a French-German venture among others, are investing in their own stealth aircraft programs.Very clearly, they see the advantages a VLO aircraft offers. And very clearly too, the expensive process to develop stealth done well reflects a contrasting assessment on systems like the S-400 or it's follow ons. And the distinct advantage a fighter with stealth has over one without.Playing from behind in stealth technology has proven to be a very costly mistake for Russia.

These terrorists are largely to blame for the major upheavals we witness today when it comes to terrorism.To make matters worse, life in Afghanistan for woman deteriorated due to American intervention.One of the reasons why Communism in Afghanistan was hated among the mujahideen was due to their egalitarian principles towards woman. Once these extremists gained power, woman's rights suffered terribly. Female literacy, access to education and life expectancy of Afghan women fell drastically. President George Bush would later use this to justify the invasion of Afghanistan.The United States government made a huge blunder by supporting Islamic extremists whom they viewed as, “holy warriors” during the Soviet invasion.This answer is not meant defending the Soviet Union. After all, the Soviet invasion caused one million deaths and five million citizens being displaced. Nonetheless, America's disdain for Communism led them to support a terrorist organization that proved far worse when it came to human rights. The view that all things communist is evil has proved catastrophic, especially during the Vietnam war.Even after the US-led invasion under Bush, woman’s rights in Afghanistan have not improved like it had during the Soviet-backed regime.After 8 years of U.S. occupation and reform, Afghanistan was ranked the second-worst country for gender inequality according to the UN statistics in 2009.Additionally, the Soviet Union did a better job in economic aid and re-building infrastructure than the United States. This is backed by the Center for American Progress that reported the Soviet Union spending more on reconstruction than the United States. Instead of economic aid and social reform, they sent in more military troops.This is America’s greatest blunder. They created instability in Afghanistan and planted the seed for Islamic extremism by supporting terrorist groups. Under the Taliban, Afghanistan became a violent and deteriorating countryMost people don’t realize how this one decision impacted history. Just think about it.Would 9/11 ever happen?

The Iraq war had just started and we were now sending our helos into the mouth of the Euphrates with a full Hellfire missile loadout.So sharper minds than mine got to work. Plans were made, drug deals were done and a scheme was hatched:To get the spare blade from the other cruiser in the battle group.Out in blue water.We were simply going to fly our one FMC (Fully Mission Capable) aircraft over to the other cruiser where their helo guys would have the spare blade out and waiting for us on the flight deck.More or less this, only with a rotor blade.Easy enough.At this point I should probably give some background on what the pilots were going to be dealing with.When not actually installed on a bird, a main rotor blade is stored in a metal, coffin style case.Here’s a whole stack of them.When in it’s coffin, a blade weighs over 300 pounds and is about 20-ish feet long.It’s got a little heft. But nothing a Seahawk can’t handle.But that weight, or rather theYou see, an aircraft maintainer knows exactly how heavy those bastards are.We move them around all the time. Usually with an electric or chain hoist. But if that isn’t available we just round up a small crew and carry them by hand.So, when the other ship’s aircraft maintainers set what was to be our new blade on their deck, they didn’t tie it down.Because it’s heavy as fuck.Surely the helo isn’t going to blow it anywhere, right?Of course that’s exactly what happened.When our bird went to hover over their deck the rotor wash picked that blade up and sent it fluttering into the deep as easily as a leaf blowing in the wind.Classic!My only regret to this story is that, since I worked the night shift, I wasn’t up on the flight deck that day to see it happen.Because that shit wasSince we weren’t the knuckleheads that did it.Oh, if only I could have seen their chief’s face and heard the epic ass chewing he almost certainly gave them.Priceless.

Fight or flight or freeze.In a situation that presents danger, living creatures will perform one of these actions. Fight, meaning we leap into action and confrontation. Flight, meaning we try to remove ourselves from the danger. Freeze, where we are facing an unfamiliar situation and do nothing.As the last several thousand years of recorded history has shown, humans have yet to grow beyond these basic instincts. It’s a part of who we are.The brilliance comes in exploiting this mindset in a military situation. Consider a classic military tactic. Encirclement.The idea of encirclement is simple. Use your forces to surround an enemy and isolate them. Cut off their means of supplying themselves with material and reinforcement. Strangle them as you make sure that you don’t run low on supplies. It’s classic thinking for military warfare, especially in regards to sieges.But I want you to think of that in terms of what I just told you. “Fight, flight or freeze”.If you take away an enemy’s ability to retreat, you are actually giving them a subtle advantage.This might be hard to understand for people who don’t expect to face life or death situations. Facing a scenario where you have a high chance of dying without chance of survival is less stressful than a situation where you might survive. Why is this? Because it’s less complicated.if you make your enemy think they can’t escape, you remove the “flight” option. And you have increased the chances of them choosing “Fight”.I’ll use a real world example to explain this better. Pirates.Now back in the days when piracy was men in giant wooden ships sailing through the Caribbean, there were several unspoken rules of piracy. One of the most important of which was FLAGS. A lot of successful pirates had their own heraldry, much like Noble Houses of Europe.Pirates would hide their flags from plain sight. They would only unfurl their banners when stalking targeted ships. They would suddenly spring the flag from cover, displaying to their prey their intent to rob and plunder.Now if you were some poor merchant ship who was suddenly ambushed on the high seas, your greatest fear was seeing THIS flag.Pirate flag of the infamous Edward LowIf you saw a RED Pirate flag unfurled that meant you were in serious trouble. Pirates who used red flags intended no mercy for their prey and were going to kill and do unspeakable things to whomever they captured, even if they surrendered and begged for their lives. Red flag pirates were torturous, murdering bastards who would probably laugh as they set you on fire or tossed you into the sea with weights tied to your ankles.What you wanted to see was THIS pirate flag.Pirate flags that had white (or lacked red generally) were from pirate crews who were more reasonable. Generally if you surrendered to these pirates (either immediately or after a short battle), the worse they would do is steal your valuables, most of your food and maybe abduct some of your crew. After that they’d let you go peacefully. They would usually kill you only if you fought to try to stop them. If you happened to be belligerent and refused to give them your supplies, they would probably torture you or threaten to torture you.Defeating your opponent isn’t just skill at arms. There’s a mental component to combat and sometimes you can defeat an opponent before you even cross swords.If you are a pirate with a red flag, here is what your opponent is going to be thinking.“Okay that pirate ship is coming for me. If I surrender or do nothing, they are definitely going to kill me. If I fight back, they MIGHT kill me. But if I fight back, maybe I’ll kill them before they kill me. I might even be able to win and go home. I think I’m going to fight back.”If you are a pirate with a non-red flag, here is what your opponent will be thinking.“Okay that pirate ship is coming for me. If I surrender or do nothing they are probably going to let me go free if I let them steal everything. If I fight back I might be able to win. If I fight back though, I could lose, be captured and then tortured to death in front of friends. Combat is unpredictable, I could be killed fighting before the battle is over. If I die I won’t be able to go home, get a drink, make love to a woman and live a peaceful life. I think I’ll take my chances with surrendering.”Contrary to what you may think, it is a poor sign of a warrior to seek battle over capitulation. Fighting is unpredictable. On the high seas, pirates defined success by captured treasures, not the number of people they killed. Sailors knew this. This is why when pirate offered fair terms their enemies surrendered almost immediately.If you back a man into a corner, he will fight to survive. If you back a man into a corner and give him a way to escape unharmed, there’s a good chance that man will take the escape route.This is why professional armies don’t massacre their prisoners. It’s why armies take prisoners in the first place. If you have an enemy surrounded, that enemy faces a choice. Fight and likely die or surrender and likely live. It’s much harder to have a man fight knowing he can surrender than fight until he stops breathing.Facing death when it’s the only option is easy. Facing death when you want to survive is hard.Now here comes the brutal part.As your enemy runs through that corridor of escape you strike HARD. Your enemy thinks they are safe. That they still have a clear path to run away. Then you attack them at their most unsuspecting. Take advantage of their weakness.This is a tactic that is used in battles of annihilation. Where the objective is to annihilate enemy spirit, not just manpower. There are countless examples of this used in history. But there is one example that chills my very soul when I think back on it.Napoleon’s FollyIt was the year 1812. Napoleon had just realized he couldn’t conquer Russia. Napoleon’s campaign to dominate the largest European kingdom had ground to a halt. He could win on the battlefield, but an extended conflict would ultimately accomplish nothing. The Russians refused to surrender, even when their own capital had been seized and the Tsar had fled. Facing an impossible situation, Napoleon ordered a withdrawal.Now the Russians could have counterattacked, encircled Napoleon and tried to capture him with their superior numbers and knowledge of the land. What they did was worse. They let the French walk back the way they came.The French army marched back through lands they had already conquered. These areas had been picked clean of food. In their places was less than nothing. Napoleon’s grand army, the largest on Earth at that time, was cut off from supplies. This was literally as the Russian winter was beginning.But they could still escape. The Russians were only behind them. So they started walking back.Yellow line represents French invasion into Russia. Black line indicates retreat. The thickness of the line represents amount of men.All the while, the Russians bled them with raids. Mounted horsemen, Irregular militias. Pin prick attacks from a thousand directions. But never a concentrated military attack. The Russians kept bleeding the French. Bit by bit by bit.The French couldn’t turn around and retaliate. The invasion had failed and now all they wanted to do was go home. They thought they would be safe if they just kept walking west. And they kept getting more and more hungry. The weather became worse and worse.This is when the Grand Army began to break down. Deserters abandoned the army in droves. Their equipment was insufficient for fighting in winter and broke down in unrelenting cold. And the Russians kept circling their flanks. Never surrounding them. Never stopping them from retreating.So the French kept walking west. There was still a chance they probably thought. If they endured a few more days, a few more hundred miles, they could make it. They kept weakening themselves. Structure and order were undone as desperation infected the French ranks. They lost whatever advantage they may have had fighting the Russians directly and weakness began to suffocate them. Hunger, disease and deprivation on a massive scale.The retreat from Russia lasted from October to December of 1812. By the time the Grand Army had entered friendly territory, they had been reduced to barely 20,000 emaciated survivors.And that’s how you destroy an army of 700,000 men. You give them hope of escape.",6 followers,Michael Tan,1K,127,5.8M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Why-did-Wakanda-fall-so-easily-in-Avengers-Infinity-War-when-Black-Panther-is-possibly-the-greatest-tactician-on-Earth-and-Wakanda-is-the-most-technologically-advanced-nation

It’s military and civilian infrastructure was torn to shreds, leaving it’s military a shadow of it’s former self and there was widespread devastation throughout the country. It achieved none of it’s war goals. And all this while inflicting minimal, almost meaningless losses on it’s enemies.After the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, the subsequent assembly of the Coalition, sanctions, and ultimatum, the Coalition launched a campaign against Iraq, starting with an air campaign that saw widespread bombing of Iraqi military targets and infrastructure, followed by an approximately 100-hour ground campaign to eject Iraqi forces out of Kuwait and then invade Iraq itself. Most of the battles were massively lopsided and ended in Coalition victories.The lower-end estimate of Iraqi soldiers killed in the war is around 25,000, and it may have been as high as 50,000. Thousands of Iraqi tanks and other armored vehicles were destroyed. One of the most infamous incidents was the “Highway of Death” affair, when Coalition aircraft obliterated a huge column of Iraqi forces retreating from Kuwait, leaving miles of destroyed vehicles and bodies. Coalition tanks, massively superior, were able to obliterate the massive armored forces of what was then the fourth largest army in the world at almost no cost. Much of the Iraqi Air Force fled to Iran, but those aircraft that stayed behind were largely devastated. The Iraqi Navy was devastated. There was also large-scale destruction of Iraqi roads and railways, refineries, power stations, bridges, factories, and broadcasting stations, and 3,664 Iraqi civilians are thought to have died.For all this, the Coalition lost 292 soldiers, of whom only 147 were actually killed by Iraqi military action: the rest died in friendly fire and other incidents. Only a handful of Coalition aircraft were shot down and armored vehicles, including tanks, destroyed by enemy action.Iraq was evicted from Kuwait, and had part of it’s own territory temporarily occupied. It was set back from being an industrialized country to a pre-industrialized one, and suffered for years under heavy sanctions. It’s military was gutted. The US-led Coalition were able to effectively commandeer large parts of it’s airspace by imposing no-fly zones a few years later in support of the Kurds. To this day Iraq is still paying reparations to Kuwait as demanded by the UN.This was probably the most humiliating defeat in living memory. Iraq not only lost completely, had it’s military torn to shreds, and suffered widespread devastation, it cost the US and it’s allies almost nothing in terms of losses to enemy action.","46,118 followers",Steven Haddock,4.9K,25.6K,343.4M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Why-did-Wakanda-fall-so-easily-in-Avengers-Infinity-War-when-Black-Panther-is-possibly-the-greatest-tactician-on-Earth-and-Wakanda-is-the-most-technologically-advanced-nation

This is the famous period of Samurai fighting Samurai that people envision when they think of feudal Japan.The wars ended when a man named Toyotomi Hideyoshi united Japan (for the most part) under his rule.Hideyoshi had a problem though. Years of war left Japan a militarized island waiting to burst. So Hideyoshi decided to invade China to keep the massive Samurai armies distracted. In order to invade China Japan needed to conquer Korea.Conquering Korea wasn’t seen as a big deal. Korea at this time was a very weak State. The limited Korean military just defended the border from raiders and that was about it. Japan meanwhile was bursting with warriors, skilled Generals, and professional armies.Japan invades Korea and the Korean Army is crushed. Korean forces never stand a chance and are pushed back to the Chinese border. However, Japan didn’t yet win.On the seas, a Korean Admiral named Yi Sun-Shin had taken a handful of Korean ships and laid waste to Japanese supply lines. Entire Japanese war fleets had been sunk and eventually, Japanese supply lines were shattered completely.It’s hard to overstate Admiral Yi’s success. He was always outnumbered and outgunned and yet he won dozens of insanely one-sided victories. For instance, he once faced down 200+ Japanese warships with only 13 ships. Not only did he win, he didn’t lose a single ship.The entire Japanese invasion had to be halted while Yi was dealt with. Japan threw more and more fleets at him and yet never defeated him.Finally after years of their invasion being stalled China entered the fray. They began to push Japanese forces back and support Yi with their own fleet. Yi would smash the Japanese in 1 final battle, forcing them to surrender their campaign and retreat in disgrace.Yi would die in this final battle- his final words to his son were “We are at the height of battle. Don't let anybody know about my death!”. A warrior until the end.Now Japan had EVERY advantage going into this warKorea shouldn’t have even been able to put up a fight and yet they ended up winning- all because of supply and logistics.Sound familiar?Fun fact- the Mongols invaded Japan multiple times (or tried to).The first time they fought and lost a minor battle when trying to land.

There would be rewards for whoever could shoot the most sparrows in a day.-The campaign was enormously successful. They drove the sparrows perilously close to extinction. Now those pesky birds wouldn’t eat the grain or fruit. Success!Or maybe not.As the Chinese soon found out, sparrows eat a lot of locusts. They are virtually their only predator.

It went up against the Vietcong's AK-47. It jammed a lot, but the AK’s did not.The Vietcong and North Vietnamese Regular were lightly armed and with hardly any training at all and most with less than 6 years of education, with most weighing under 100 pounds.

It didn’t matter that your army was made up of spoiled brats - they still destroyed anything they wanted to.But by the late 14th century, it was becoming clear that knights were no longer the be-all and end-all of warfare. Now, beiFor centuries in Europe, armoured knights were the ulimate weapon. A knight in armor on a war horse was effectively indestructable.

It didn’t matter that your army was made up of spoiled brats - they still destroyed anything they wanted to.But by the late 14th century, it was becoming clear that knights were no longer the be-all and end-all of warfare. Now, being a knight was expensive - imagine your armor costing as much as a house and your horse costing about the same. That’s the capital outlay involved.But Knights were soon being outclassed by theseAnd theseThese new weapons required a lot of practice and discipline, but not a lot of money.Now, you’ve heard of Agincourt and how an English force of about 1,500 beat a French one of about 10,000, handing out casualties in the 50–1 range along the way. You may also have heard how this put an end to Knights as a fighting force.But that’s just wrong. English archers were defeating Knights well before Agincourt, and would continue to do so after Agincourt. The Pike Square was really the thing that did in the last heavy armoured force in Europe and saved Switzerland from being taken over by Burgundy.In fact, the Battle of Crecy, in 1346 (over 60 years before Agincourt), archers showed their effectiveness against armour. It’s not like the French didn’t see the effectiveness of bows, but they were still using crossbows and couldn’t keep up the rate of fire the English could with the longbow. The reason why crossbows, which were very effective against armour, hadn’t dominated the battlefield was the tiresome process of reloading them. Longbows didn’t have that problem. At Crecy, the English outkilled the French by at least 10–1, and some estimates put it closer to 100–1.And in 1476, 130 years after Crecy, the heavily armoured Burgundians were routed by a bunch of well regimented Swiss with pike staffs at the Battle of Morat. The Swiss Confederacy outkilled the Burgundians by a ratio of something between 15–1 and 30–1. That was it for armour at last and armies all over Europe abandoned it in favour of quick moving infantry and archers on foot.So, it took European Knights 130 years to realize they were obsolete and to finally give it up in favour of cheaper infantry troops. The armour became epaulets on their shoulders and instead of fighting battles, they led men into battle.",261 followers,Scott Goldman,6.4K,954,29.3M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-worst-military-mistakes-that-changed-history

Horrific.They missed a few children. Can you imagine what do they have to live through after this? It’s heartbreaking.We all know about Hamas they attack civilians and protect themselves with civilians.
