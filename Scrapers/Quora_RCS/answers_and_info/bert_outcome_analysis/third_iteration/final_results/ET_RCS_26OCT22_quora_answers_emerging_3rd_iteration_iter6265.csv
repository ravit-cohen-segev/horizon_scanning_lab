This is not going to change any time soon. Global electricity use is skyrocketing and smartphones, tablets and e-readers are becoming more common. Additionally, batteries are finding applications in energy storage as the renewable energy sector continues to grow.Engineers and scientists have developed many new technologies to meet our storage needs, but none seem to have established themselves as the ultimate technology. Flywheel, compressed air, and thermal storage are strong contenders for grid-scale storage, while lithium-ion, nickel-cadmium, and nickel-metal hydride batteries compete for portable electricity storage. It all boils down to the fact that we still haven't found an optimal way to store our electricity. This article will discuss the technology and potential of lithium batteries.Until the 1990s, nickel-cadmium (NiCad) batteries were pretty much the only option in rechargeable batteries. The main problem with these devices was that they had a high temperature coefficient. This meant that the performance of the cells would plummet when heated. In addition, cadmium, one of the main elements in the cell, is expensive and harmful to the environment (it is also used in thin-film panels). Nickel metal hydride (NiMH) and lithium ion emerged as competitors to NiCad in the 1990s. Since then, an overwhelming number of technologies have appeared on the market. Among these lithium-ion batteries stand out as a promising candidate for a wide range of uses.To know more here",37 followers,Jason Ford,2.2K,3.3K,16.6M,2010,https://www.quora.com/How-will-lithium-battery-technology-evolve

Lithium batteries also have a longer shelf life when compared to the previous batteries. These batteries are not just used in the tech industry, but they have also made their way into a lot of other industries as well. Companies that store a lot of inventory for a long period of time use these batteries. These batteries can store a lot of power, which reduces the time required to charge up the device. These batteries also have a longer shelf life, which means that they can be stored for a long time without being replaced. Nowadays, you can find lithium batteries even in simple household appliances like smoke alarms and flashlights. It is predicted that lithium battery technology will continue to evolve at a rapid pace in the coming years. This will lead to better performance of the devices that use these batteries.

However, with technological breakthroughs and the realization of large-scale production, its cost is expected to decrease rapidly. The polymer solid electrolyte with PEO or PEO-like base membrane is expected to accelerate the commercialization process, thereby driving the increase in the permeability of polymer lithium-ion batteries.",0 followers,Claire Jordan,2.3K,45.6K,295.7M,2021,https://www.quora.com/How-will-lithium-battery-technology-evolve
3,"Infantry will become more dispersed and more deadly. Infantry tactics will become lethal games of hide and seek.Looking at military evolution since the Black Powder era, we see more and more power devolving into lower and lower levels. In the Great War, Machine guns were often held in separate units, regiments had organic artillery and lots of other combat enablers. By the Second World War, machine guns were organic at unit level, Infantry were starting to receive weapons to deal with tanks on their own (PIAT, Bazooka’s andInfantry will become more dispersed and more deadly.

By the Second World War, machine guns were organic at unit level, Infantry were starting to receive weapons to deal with tanks on their own (PIAT, Bazooka’s andBy the 1960’s, infantry firepower was increasing by orders of magnitude with the adoption of assault rifles, and far better hand held anti armour weapons. Radios were also becoming common down to the platoon level.Today, we have man portable ATGM’s, automatic rifles and light machine guns organic to the sections/squad level, grenade launchers at the section/squad level, Day/night/thermal imaging down at the platoon/section/squad level and so on. Individuals may communicate within sections using small, short range radios. and solders have access to a wide range of official and unofficial electronic devices and aids (a soldier with a smartphone and Google Maps, camera and recording device is a pretty common sight on deployment).Looking ahead, soldiers will be able to engage virtually every target the see. They will use small UAV’s or quad copters to find the things they cannot see, and have enough firepower to deal with virtually every target they encounter, or the ability to contact higher level assets to deal with the things they do not. The will also seek out enemies using Social Media posts (Russian solders in Ukraine were outed using the metadata from Facebook posts; imagine being able to do something like that in real time) and sensor fusion from a wide variety of on and off board platforms.At the same time, they will also be hunted by enemies with similar capabilities. Low tech enemies will use “Sousveillance”, literally weaponizing every person in the battlespace with a cell phone and connection to provide persistent observation of enemy units. High tech enemies may fill the battlespace with all kinds of UAV’s, remote sensors and intelligent weapons and machines on the ground and in the water to seek out opponents.So the name of the game is to move as fast and as unobtrusively as possible, set up a fire position and be prepared to fire your Anti Personnel Guided Missile at a fleeting target, while rapidly exfiltrating the spot the second you pull the trigger. A cloud of mini UAVs may be covering your withdrawal, or flying in to run you to ground.Infantry will still have the unique ability to take and hold ground, and individual soldiers will be adaptable and unpredictable in ways machines cannot be (at least for several more generations), so Infantry may remain decisive on the battlefield a long way into the future.",12 followers,Joe Lincoln,2.3K,627,1.3M,2018,https://www.quora.com/How-will-lithium-battery-technology-evolve

Breeds that forget this basic truth have always paid for it with their lives and freedoms…War is not violence and killing, pure and simple; war is controlled violence, for a purpose.

There is aTherefore, modern military tactics are often dictated byOn the other side, with the introduction of very precise artillery systems, a frontal infantry assault can be much better prepared than in the past and would result in less casualties.That we don’t see massive infantry assaults anymore has also nothing to do with the terrain. An attack which only involves infantry troops (without armored vehicles)Why we’ve seen so many massive infantry attacks over open terrain in earlier wars had to do with the lack of alternative weapons (tanks). If you have no tanks and must attack, then you really have no other choice than to send your infantry forward.One must also bear in mind that we haven’t fought in any major conventional conflict since many years and that massive infantry assaults are an unsuitable tool to fight the insurgents and Guerrillas of today’s conflicts.On a smaller unit scale, frontal infantry attacks are still an everyday occurrence. As a response to an ambush or as a counter or surprise attack, directly assaulting your enemy can make a lot of sense.And sometimes, you have no other choice. When you are cut off and under heavy enemy fire, the only possible direction to go might be straight towards your enemy’s lines.","43,444 followers",Misha Firer,1.3K,1.3K,133.8M,2018,https://www.quora.com/How-will-military-infantry-tactics-and-technology-evolve-in-the-future
