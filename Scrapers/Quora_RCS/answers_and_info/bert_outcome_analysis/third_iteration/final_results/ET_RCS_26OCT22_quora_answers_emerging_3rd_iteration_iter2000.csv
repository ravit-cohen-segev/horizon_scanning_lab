Because we haven’t even gotten to single pilot operations and it takes over a decade to design and build a new passenger jet. Airbus’s next clean sheet jet is supposed to be powered by Hydrogen and is supposed to come out by 2035. I don’t think it will be single pilot. Why? Airbus hasn’t announced it.

They would have it would be in their best interest that way people can get used to the idea before they decide to board one. Also, one of the main points of reducing the number of crew in the cockpit is being able to make the plane more aerodynamic. The concepts Airbus released for their planes have fronts that look like those of 2 pilot planes. But maybe they just rendered them like that but that’s not the final design. Both Airbus and Boeing have said single pilot and pilotless operations (if we ever get to pilotless) will appear on cargo aircraft first. Not passengers jets. I will start “getting worried” about single pilot planes when I start seeing ground centers being built for the so called “super dispatchers” that will replace first officers. That will mean single pilot operations are coming. But there aren’t any planned or in construction. I do think we will single pilot operations by the end of the century. But single pilot operations by 2030 is not possible if you simply do the math. The planes built today and that are in the backlogs for Airbus and Boeing are being built for 2 pilots. They will roll off the assembly line for the next 5–10 years and will be retired sometime between 2040 and 2050The plane Airbus has planned in 2025 the Airbus A321 XLR which will also be built with a 2 pilot cockpit and has a few hundred orders if not more will continue to be built until 2030–2035 which means those two pilot airframes will be flying for a few decades too. Airbus has also stated their latest Autonomous Takeoff and Taxi tests are not there to replace pilots. Which is a statement they would not make if they planned on removing pilots. From the cockpit. Manufacturers were very straightforward when they developed a plane without the flight engineer. It was clear his seat was gone. (Not only that but the flight engineer was not a pilot. His job was not to fly the plane it was to watch instruments that wouldn’t fit on the firewall in front of the pilots. He relayed information necessary to flying to the pilots. The Autopilot had the same abilities when he was replaced as it does today.)Airlines will make it very clear when their next plane will fly with only one pilot on board. Overall though the industry even with advances in automation in other domains does not point to that direction.If flying, the most complex form of transportation on the planet is going to be completely pilotless then why is it Rockets, which are already automated and flown from mission control still have manual flight controls in the Dragon Capsule? Why is it the space plane that could be replacing the space shuttle (Dreamer I think) is being built with a flight deck and flight controls even if it can be flown autonomously for cargo? Why is it Boom aviation a company that is researching supersonic aviation is training pilots? Why are Boeing and Airbus creating pipeline projects so more pilots will be trained? Why did Airbus explain that their future 2050 planes which will be “intelligent planes capable of self organizing” will still have pilots on board? Boeing said that there next plane will focus on pilot machine interface (in response to the MAX crashes)Also Mike Sinett who’s job at Boeing is literally to sell the technology said that pilotless airliners are a “Big IF” Airbus has also said that too. Boeing said we will Almost have to make these things fly themselves. Note the Almost. And that was a response to if pilots wouldn’t be able to fly planes anymore due to lack of training because of the shortage.There was also a document I found on an Airbus website which illustrates the multiple levels of aircraft autonomy all the way up to 5. At Level 4 There can be single pilot airliners. Guess what level we are at now. I will give you a guess. Cars are at level 3 and close to level 4 right now. Surgical robots are testing their level 3 with STAR autonomous robot surgeons.Airliners are at level…. 1.5… wow.I will also add that Airbus specifically adds removing the copilot but never removing the pilot. From what I have read from many many sources is that pilotless travel (remote operated) will be for Urban Air Mobility which will also start with pilots on board. Did you also know they will have parachutes in the case of an emergency? Just shows you how confident they are nothing will go wrong…This is already really long if you want me to lengthen it tell me in the comments. But I think I have explained enough.figure 1. Airbus’s Automation timeline notice how far away we are from single pilot operationsFigure 2. Do these planes really look like they are designed for 1 or 0 pilots? Wouldn’t it make more sense to make the planes more aerodynamic if no pilots were sitting up front? Just make the plane longer in the back to add more people.TLDR: extraordinarily surprised.

The aircraft was a DC-10, the exact aircraft in the picture below:A little over an hour into the flight, the engine mounted in the tail suffered an uncontained failure — in essence the turbine exploded and in doing so took out the entire aircraft’s hydraulic control system thus rendering the aircraft uncontrollable by normal means.Luckily there were not only the Captain and First Officer in the cockpit but also a Training Check Airman.After the failure, the Captain determined that the aircraft was unresponsive to the pilot’s controls as it began an uncommanded roll to the right and the nose began dropping. This should well have been the precursor to the aircraft’s completely loss of control and almost assuredly the loss of all lives onboard.Note: Airline pilots have Emergency Check Lists for every emergency scenario that can be thought of. Except, of course, this one.Rather that reiterating the details — which are available in the Wikipedia link below — the pilots ultimately tried something they had never been trained for, and used the power on the remaining two engines, including the use of asymmetric thrust (more power on one side than the other), to control the aircraft onto final approach at Sioux City Iowa.Ultimately, control was lost in the last few seconds, but only 111 of the 296 passengers and crew were lost, 35 due to smoke inhalation which indicates they survived the crash landing.Let’s be clear about something. Since this type of failure had never been experienced in this model of aircraft before, there is a very small likelihood that an automated aircraft without human intervention would have been able to save the aircraft from complete loss of control, not to mention its ultimate miraculous arrival.This tragedy was no worse than it was because there were PILOTS ONBOARD who used their collective experience to regain control of an aircraft that was on the brink of loss of control.No, I like knowing there are living breathing folks sitting up on the fight deck that I can complain about when they hammer a landing. :-)United Airlines Flight 232 - Wikipedia","35,156 followers",C Stuart Hardwick,1.1K,12.3K,143M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-will-be-the-impact-of-pilotless-planes-in-the-future-As-technology-is-getting-advanced-day-by-day-would-it-be-surprising-for-us-to-fly-on-a-plane-without-pilots-in-the-upcoming-decade

18,"Rather than a single gee-whiz technology, I think the most transformative change will be the replacement of low- and medium-skill labor by robots and software.  This change is happening now, and accounts for the persistent underemployment we see in advanced economies.Even as manufacturing output rises, there are fewer and fewer jobs in manufacturing, and they don't pay as well as they used to.  Same story with resource extraction and construction - bigger and smarter machines need fewer humans to operate and direct them.  In the office, clerical jobs have already pretty much disappeared.  LegaRather than a single gee-whiz technology, I think the most transformative change will be the replacement of low- and medium-skill labor by robots and software.

Same story with resource extraction and construction - bigger and smarter machines need fewer humans to operate and direct them.  In the office, clerical jobs have already pretty much disappeared.  Legal work is increasingly performed by software, and the time is not far off when robots and algorithms start performing routine tasks in health care.The result of these changes is that we will (and already do) have plenty of wealth, but that wealth will be produced by smaller and smaller numbers of people.  The traditional 40-hour-a-week job will no longer be common enough to distribute this wealth in a way that makes sense or that produces a stable social order.Our current system for distributing wealth is (notionally) based on meritocracy - that those who are the most talented and hardest-working receive the greatest share of wealth.  Fine.  But what happens when a substantial portion of the population is capable of contributing almost nothing?  We can't all be above average.  Can a society based on a winner-take-all mentality survive as a liberal democracy when 30, 40 or 50% of the population is incapable of making significant economic contributions?We could start adapting by spreading jobs around - shortening the 40 hour work week to 30 or even 20.  But there is only so far that one can go with this approach - being a productive scientist or surgeon or lawyer requires many hours of intensive work to acquire and build skills.  Three scientists working 20 hour weeks will not be anywhere as proficient as one scientist working a 60 hour week.It seems unlikely that we will ever uncouple distribution of wealth from work - that is, have a guaranteed minimal income.  A more plausible path forward, one that avoids a descent into a repressive oligarchy, would be to valorize social work - care for children or the elderly - much more than we now do.  Not every has, or can acquire, technological skills, but nearly all humans have pretty good social skills.  If we start rewarding these skills, we can maintain an equitable society without creating a class of free-riders.",18 followers,Asim Qureshi,17K,996,156M,2016,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-upcoming-breakthroughs-in-technology-that-will-totally-blow-our-minds-in-the-future-years-to-come

Even if not, this is still a major step forward towards generating organs to order, without fear of rejection. Even if the heart is rejected and the donor dies, what we learn from the process will enable us to succeed the next time. I reckon this will become the mainstream way we get spare parts by the end of the decade in an optimistic scenario, by the end of the next decade in the pessimistic one.Either way, the moment is as groundbreaking as December 3rd, 1967, when the first human heart ever was transplanted, ushering the era of organ transplants of today.

I wrote about this before. As an amateur astronomer who has been looking at the stars since I was a kid, I found this fact amazing.My older sisters and I once found the Andromeda galaxy just above the constellation Andromeda. We were very excited to see that faint, fuzzy little patch of light that we figured was the whole Andromeda galaxy which is 2.5 million light years away from our own Milky Way galaxy. We had to look at it with averted vision to actually see it nicely. BUT, we were wrong. We were not looking at the whole Andromeda galaxy.THAT was only the bright centre of the galaxy we were looking at, bright because the stars are densest in the centre of the galaxy. It has a cute name, the Galactic Bulge.If your eyes could gather light like a time lapse camera, and the faintest stars would become much brighter then you could actually see them, the Andromeda galaxy would look like this is the night sky beside the moon. What my sisters and I were actually looking at was the centre, the rest of the galaxy was too dim to be seen.Can you imagine seeing this sight in the night sky? It’s there, you just can’t see it, the stars are too dim.Another astonishing thing is that the Andromeda galaxy and our Milky Way galaxy are barrelling toward each other at 250,000 MPH OR 402,336 KPH. In around 4.5 billion years, the two galaxies will collide with each other. Devastating? Not really. The stars in the galaxies are so distant, there will be few if any colliding stars. The galaxies will pass through each other however, gravity will pull them back together and the two galaxies will form a giant, elliptical galaxy.When the two galaxies collide, the Solar System will be swept out three times farther from the galactic core than its current distance. They also predict a 12% chance that the Solar System will be ejected from the new galaxy sometime during the collision. Such an event would have no adverse effect on the system and the chances of any sort of disturbance to the Sun or planets themselves may be remote.However, by that time, our sun would have gone through its red giant stage and would have already consumed Mercury and Venus. Earth will be very close but it’s water would have been boiled away long ago and Earth will be at that time devoid of all life. A crispy cinder would be all that is left of that majestic, life filled world.Hang on to your hats. Our solar system located in the Orion arm of our own Milky Way galaxy which is 100,000 light years across and swirling around like a giant frisbee, travels at an average speed of 515,000 mph (828,000 km/h). Even at this rapid speed, the solar system would take about 230 million years to travel all the way around the Milky Way. That’s one hell of a merry go round ride!Above.
