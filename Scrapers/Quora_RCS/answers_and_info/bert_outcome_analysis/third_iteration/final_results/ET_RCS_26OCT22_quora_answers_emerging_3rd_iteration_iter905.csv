0,Why is the idea of socialism becoming so popular in the United States amongst the younger people?Because you don’t understand what socialism is.

1,Automation is completely transforming the job market. Human labor is becoming obsolete in many sectors of the economy. Future policy is going to be faced with this unprecedented problem.,1 follower,Gordon Strathdee,4K,783,12.2M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-policies-can-enable-the-United-States-to-lead-the-next-technological-revolution-brought-on-by-robotics-and-advances-in-computer-science
2,"The US is the most technologically advanced nation there ever was, so obviously not! I had the privilege of living there for 4 years in the 90s. It was a little like a sci-fi movie when someone gets transported to the future - I would just wander about gazing at the technological marvels that surrounded me. Just to pick out some of the highlights:1) Domestic life - I was once visiting a friend’s house and their mother happened to be loading clothes into the washing machine. She turned to me and said, “Do you have washing machines in Scotland?” Obviously, I was forced to admit, that no we didn’The US is the most technologically advanced nation there ever was, so obviously not!

She turned to me and said, “Do you have washing machines in Scotland?” Obviously, I was forced to admit, that no we didn’t. Instead we just went down to the river and bashed our clothes off rocks to clean them.2) Transport - I spent two weeks in the lovely town of Columbia. Missouri. There I amazed the locals with my insistence on using a strange outmoded form of transport known as “walking”. Locals would slow down as they passed in their modern cars, pointing and laughing. To them, it must have been like watching a live action version of the Flintstones.3) Voting – would you believe it, but in the UK we still vote by drawing a little X next to the candidate we want to vote for. No sign of the advanced electronic voting they have over in the states. Indeed, we are so old fashioned that we haven’t even outsourced our voting to the Russians yet!4) Guns – It may be hard for an American to believe but almost nobody in the UK owns their own guns. This means that if we have to rise up and overthrow our own government (currently seems like a good plan) then we will be armed with nothing more than some particularly well sharpened sarcasm.Still, perhaps one day we can hope to be as advanced as the US. And there is some hope, as we now have our very own version of Donald Trump as PM!4K","23,887 followers",Robin Daverman,2.9K,2.3K,40.1M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-policies-can-enable-the-United-States-to-lead-the-next-technological-revolution-brought-on-by-robotics-and-advances-in-computer-science
3,"The robot revolution has been taking place for several decades now.But instead of robots rising up and killing humans, it’s taking the form of automation gradually replacing humans in the work force. As AI gets better and better, robots will be able to do more and more of what used to require a human to do.In an ideal world, this would result in humans living lives of luxury as robots did all the work for us. But we don’t live in an idea world, so what we see is more a case of rising unemployment and wealth being concentrated at the very top.",UNKNOWN,Bill Yu Liao (廖彧),650,138,1.9M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-policies-can-enable-the-United-States-to-lead-the-next-technological-revolution-brought-on-by-robotics-and-advances-in-computer-science
