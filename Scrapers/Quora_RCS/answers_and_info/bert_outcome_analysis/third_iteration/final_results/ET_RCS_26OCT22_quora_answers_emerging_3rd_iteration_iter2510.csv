It seems like technology is progressing really fast today, but that is because of all the technology that literally took ages to figure out.How long would it take to figure out how to do any of the simple technologies above, simply by trial and error? It could take a really long time, for example, to figure out what Iron Ore looks like, and how to build a forge hot enough to melt it. Especially if you didn’t even have any idea that Iron even exists.I mean, come on. Everyone knows rocks don’t melt. If they did, how could we use them to build ovens. Right????So there are a lot of hurdles. But once a technology has been figured out, we can build on it to create the next step.These days, we’ve figured out enough things to do a lot. We’ve also figured out something called science, which is the art of figuring out new things.Tasks that were once really hard, become much easier.

That allows others to becomes tradesmen, businessmen, and physics professors.Do not underestimate the rapidity of technical innovation during this period. It may seem slow, but that’s because today we take bronze and iron for granted. There were likely enormous advances in farming technology, but the wooden tools and plows used did not last for archeologists to study.The question says that “advanced technology” took place 500 years ago. With the rapid growth of technology, it mightSecond answer (much more speculative, perhaps even whimsical): The true advance of humans came from a human genetic mutation that took place about 3000 years ago. One of my names for it is “the dissatisfaction gene.” This was a gene that made people unsatisfied with their present situation. Animals never developed this; they search for environments that are good enough, and then they are satisfied. House cats are prototypical. But even elephants seem to be happy when they find a place with lots of grass and water.Not humans. Those who had this gene were never happy enough with what they had, and they pushed and developed and worked hard and created an ever expanding civilization.If you too are cursed with this gene (I think I am) then it is difficult to be happy, because no matter what you achieve, you want to do more. For that reason I sometimes refer to it as the “Original Sin Gene.” Like the original sin of Judaism and Christianity, it dooms humans to suffering. No matter how much life improves, we want it to be better.There is a solution that I personally try. I recognize that I must continue to strive to achieve more, and this is my burden. But I also can rise above it, and look at the world, and realize how blessed I am to live in such a wonderful place.

The size of the groups allowed some degree of survival partitioning into efficiencies. Once basic needs were met by efficient processes, other developments became possible.

28,"Uhh… we’ve made a lot of them.In fact, if you’ve seen it in a TV show or film and the costume didn’t need CG or post work in a studio, then human beings used real life fabrics, plastics, rubber, and whatever else they needed to bring that super hero’s outfit to life.So, technically, if the superhero’s outfit is basically just a costume that covers their skin with purpose to disguise them, then we’ve made countless examples that work in real life.However, If the suit in the comics is supposed to be clothes AND say, body armor, like Iron Man’s armor……well, we’re still working on that.

What fiction can do isn’t always realistically possible… we’re still a long way from a function Mk. 3 Iron Man suit. But as far as practical costumes that could be worn by a super hero? Sure… we have the technology for that.All though I would definitely avoid these outfits:They were almost pure leather and couldn’t really bend at the joints very well. You can check out the DVD outtakes for some hilarious moments brought about by costume difficulty.And for that matter, avoid this:A bat suit made almost entirely out of black rubber, which was heavy, unbreathable, and was very difficult to move in… especially the head and neck. (Looked great though!) I personally think of this outfit as a necessary evil; Batman’s costume is supposed to be black in the comics, but due to coloring limitations, it usually is drawn blue. This costume really blew me away as a kid, and set a new tone for how Batman could be done in live action.But when it comes to functionality, I actually have to give a lot of credit for this outfit:It’s cheesy looking, but it breathes, it moves, and it’s a spot-on match for what Superman wore in the comics at the time. I still look at this and think, “Damn, that’s Superman!” It’s definitely showing it’s age in this photograph, but Christopher Reeve and that outfit certainly made an impression on me as a kid.40 years later, costume making has improved greatly. I love all the work that’s put into modern costuming, and have friends here in Los Angeles who are professional designers, as well as other friends who are serious cosplayers… it’s AMAZING what can be done now.","4,036 followers",Vedant Das Swain,672,539,4.6M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Did-anyone-think-if-its-something-suspicious-how-humans-advanced-technologically-more-in-the-last-150-years-than-compared-to-the-millions-of-years-of-human-life

I’m notTony Stark can be very egotistic, but we can all agree there’s a reason he is in the top five smartest Marvel characters in comics.This little strip might be one of my favorite proof of it. The armor Tony is wearing is the Endosym armor, a combo of liquid smart metal and symbiote, capable of facing down the likes of Havoc and Storm with ease. Even his Hulkbuster Mark II that fought Green Scar Hulk was no match for it.Top that off that he had just given Matt Murdock, aka Daredevil, his sight back using the Extremis virus and had tricked the entirety of San Fransisco into thinking of him as the greatest person in the world (despite his lack of morals from the Inversion) and you realize that this Tony may not be the smartest version of himself (he’s had a lot of smart moments over the years), but this is him if he weren’t limited by his own morals and codes. Loose as they might be, we should still be thankful Stark has those morals, or the Marvel Earth might be a much different place.Cheers!",181 followers,Kenny Nguyen,3.7K,2.3K,45.8M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Did-anyone-think-if-its-something-suspicious-how-humans-advanced-technologically-more-in-the-last-150-years-than-compared-to-the-millions-of-years-of-human-life

The video game genre is my best guessI’m going to be honest, while I remain unconvinced that the majority of people are getting tired of superhero movies, if I’m wrong then the Video Game genre would be my prediction of being the next most popular thing in blockbuster moviesThey’re similar in that they have lots of source material to work with, but video games have barely scratched the surface with theirs and lately we’ve been getting some damn good VG moviesSonic The Hedgehog 1&2, Detective Pikachu, there’s an upcoming Mario movie that’ll be… interesting, I’m interested in what other video game movies will be like in the futureIf not video game movies, then I’m honestly not sure. My best second guess would be the MonsterVerse, but they barely produce these days. Both a blessing and a curse than it’s not as popular as DC and Marvel, but I’m still invested in it regardlessIn video games? Already doneI’m not an expert on the video game community, but from what I know I’m pretty sure Nintendo is the MCU of video gamesThey’ve got plenty of awesome game series. Kirby and Pokémon alone is honestly better than DC and Marvel combined in video games, let alone throwing Mario and Legend of Zelda into the mix. Smash Ultimate is my current favorite video game of all time and is pretty much the definitive fighting game in most peoples eyes, which is why Minecraft characters were collabed in it and I wish PS4 Spider-Man would make his debutNintendo regularly produces way more video games than Marvel and DC combined and they’re usually pretty good. Yeah there are some stinkers here and there, namely Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl, but there are also awesome games like Legends Arceus and Kirby The Forgotten LandNeither are trash in video games, but it’s pretty obvious who’s king around hereEtc, Marvel and DC are two of the greatest entertainment companies out there but there are plenty of areas they are beat.
