0,"hi, in my opinion , the future of India post is actually quite bright. the reasons are :1.. I personally found the service provided by India post, comparable or even better than most private courier services. A recent CAG report also vouches for this. You can read about the report here:2. India post has been evolving over the years and has been diversifying into other sectors like Postal Life Insurance , Forex Services etc and is even exploring expanding into providing banking services etc.3.

The explosive growth of e-commerce in India is increasing the revenues of the postal department. It has a huge advantage in this area over other private players, because none of them can match its reach, particularly in rural areas. The postal department is now aggressively focusing on expanding its operations in the e-commerce segment and had recently opened its first  exclusive e -commerce  center at Delhi. You can read more on this here :But having stated all this, it still has to address certain issues such as implementation of technology, better tracking etc if it has to take advantage of these arising opportunities and compete successfully with  private providers.",68 followers,Aashray Raj,705,0,0,2015,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-future-of-India-Post-Bhartiya-Dak-considering-the-advanced-technology-of-communication-and-competition-from-other-private-courier-services

2,"No. Nobody has ever come close to what we have today, technologically. If ancient peoples had been making CAT scan machines or nuclear-powered aircraft carriers, we would know about it.It's possible that there have been societies that took care of their people better than we do, ensuring that everyone had a vote and access to justice and health care (such as it was). These things don't leave physical remains, but they still qualify as advancement.",3 followers,Mark Bradford,12.8K,579,2.5M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Would-advanced-technology-be-possible-if-humans-had-never-figured-out-how-to-use-fire
3,"Probably exactly the same.See, fire was discovered at least 1.8 million years ago, long before our species existed. Fire came into use around the time Homo habilis was turning into Homo erectus. The difference of a thousand years at that distance is essentially nothing. It likely wouldn’t have had the slightest effect on our evolution or history.","5,360 followers",Valerio Cietto,677,2.4K,9.1M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Would-advanced-technology-be-possible-if-humans-had-never-figured-out-how-to-use-fire

This invention could remove language barriers and make travelling - and doing business with other cultures – much easier. With these earbuds, someone could be standing in front of you speaking French, and the earbuds will feed you the English translation. You can then hold down your right earbud and speak in English, and your phone will project the French translation from the Pixel's speaker, so the other person can hear. The earbuds can translate 40 different l1. Translator earbudsGoogle’s Pixel Buds pair with the Pixel smartphone and use Google Translate to translate languages in real time.

I think you need to prove that. I was born into a world before internet. Sundays were silent. Seriously, it was about as quiet as today’s quarantine days.

7,"Disney owns ILM and Disney Imagineering.ILM can build pretty much anything, they even design and build computer components like specialized graphics cards. A good friend of mine, who sells graphics cards to post production houses, once said ‘I wish I could sell to ILM but they build their own stuff in house.Disney Imagineering does similar work as well.They also own Pixar, who’s 3D animation solution (Pixar’s Renderman) is an industry standard as well.","5,990 followers",Jens Böttiger,566,2.6K,17.6M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-future-of-India-Post-Bhartiya-Dak-considering-the-advanced-technology-of-communication-and-competition-from-other-private-courier-services

9,"At present writing, DIS is worth $278 billion, and Microsoft is worth $1.6 trillion. That is, Microsoft is priced at about 6 Disneys.

10,"It is impossible to physically test all the transistors on a CPU, mostly because most transistors inputs are not controllable and their outputs are not observable via the available CPU pins. We try to ensure that the CPU is functional, which would also imply that all transistors are functioning well.A test plan is developed including a number of test vectors (which cover various CPU operations) and their ideal outputs. Applying these vectors is not trivial since it is simply not possible to expose all registers needed to apply test vectors as CPU pins to the external world.

Applying these vectors is not trivial since it is simply not possible to expose all registers needed to apply test vectors as CPU pins to the external world. Thus the test vectors are actually fed in serially to the CPU registers via JTAG chain (daisy chained registers, which can accept input from internal circuits or the external scan input in testing mode). The processor is allowed to run for n number of cycles and the output is then scanned out serially. It is a slow and expensive process, thus a major challenge in CPU design is to devise a minimal set of test vectors that offer maximum coverage of faults. Another point to be noted is that unlike software, a CPU cannot be patched after it is released (it can be recalled and a functioning redesigned CPU can be shipped, but that is really expensive). Thus the coverage level sought is quite high.","9,986 followers",Brett Bergan,670,7K,83.5M,2015,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-future-of-India-Post-Bhartiya-Dak-considering-the-advanced-technology-of-communication-and-competition-from-other-private-courier-services

In this sample, 392 have defects of some sort, leaving only 185 that can be used as intended.Assuming these are CPU dies with integrated GPU, any defect in a GPU region can result in a CPU with the GPU disabled and be sold at a lower price.

If this is a die with six CPU cores, one pair of cores can be disabled to make it a quad core. In that way, maybe half of the defective chips can be salvaged.With say 14nm production there are fewer transistors per die, and thus a lower probability of defects as compared to 7nm production. The defect rate goes up because there simply are a lot more transistors and a lot more opportunities for a defect to occur.The problem is greatly compounded when the die is quite large, because then the possible number of good dies per wafer goes down and the probability of getting defects goes up. GPU dies like those made by Nvidia are easier to bin because multiple compute units can be disabled and still result in a perfectly functional product.Just as a case in point. A RTX 2080 has 46 compute units, while a RTX 2060 KO has only 30. But they both use the same TU104 silicon. The 2060 KO edition has a whopping 16 of its compute units disabled. Fully 1024 of its GPU cores are dead. You simply can’t do that with CPU silicon.",578 followers,Jiya Pankaj Aggarwal,19.1K,64,657.7K,2021,https://www.quora.com/Would-advanced-technology-be-possible-if-humans-had-never-figured-out-how-to-use-fire
