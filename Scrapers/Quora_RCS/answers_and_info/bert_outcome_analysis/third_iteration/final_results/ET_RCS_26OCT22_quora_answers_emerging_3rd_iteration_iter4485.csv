2,"I’m going to disagree with everyone else here and say (almost always) no.

While I agree that there is room at the bottom of a market when there is a dominant player (especially in really big markets like CRM, ERP, marketing automation, etc), why would you want to solve a problem that has already been solved?We are at a truly unique time in history. Because of a combination of cloud computing, new platforms like the app store and the browser to easily distribute software, and end users getting used to having their problems solved with software, we have an unprecedented opportunity to create and distribute truly world changing software. We are enabled to solve the problems that consumers and businesses have in ways and at a scale never before seen! So find a problem, and solve it!Being a copycat usually sucks. You will always have to charge below what the competitor is charging unless they have really screwed something up. Because they are ahead of you with their product, they create more value for your customer, they have a better brand, etc - so they can charge more. Being first to market is great. Sure you have to build the market, but as it develops, you are out in front of everyone - and you get to define the market. If you take the copycat model, someone else defines your destiny. And remember, while they may decide to buy you, they may just decide to turn their focus downmarket and kill you too.And how do you find new problems? The consumer market is usually a little more obvious for this type of thing since you are a consumer, you probably know your problems or the problems of people you know and can scratch your own itch. But to find problems that businesses have, interview people in business and dive deep on their problems. (BTW, make sure to solve a problem that a large market of people would answer yes if you asked, “If I have a team of engineers build this in the next 4 months, would you buy it for $X?” People will express interest or curiosity in lots of things, but you want to make sure they’ll actually buy the solution that you build.)This is how I approached starting my SaaS business, and while we also have copycats now, I think that you’ll be more satisfied solving a new problem than trying to fight it out for someone else’s scraps that they left behind.PS - I’m not saying that you can’t copy something and make money. Lots of people have done that. But if you are smart enough to do that, you are smart enough to have found and solved a new problem, and created new value for the world. So be bold and carve a new path! Build something!",18 followers,Asim Qureshi,8.7K,996,156M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Who-are-the-best-universities-to-engage-in-a-technology-pilot-for-SaaS-startup
