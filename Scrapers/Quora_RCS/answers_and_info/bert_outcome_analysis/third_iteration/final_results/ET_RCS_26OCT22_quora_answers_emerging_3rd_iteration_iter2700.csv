0,"It’s not. Not at all.Save your money - the 3080 series Nvidia GPU isn’t that impressive or that big a Gain over the previous generation. Quite the opposite it’s pretty weak on the whole when you look at gains over priors going back a fair ways.Instead, wait for reviews to be certain but the upcoming AMD 6000 series GPU is looking to be very competitive on price, performance, and power… especially with right ecosystem of 500 series mobo and 5000 series CPU as AMD has a new trick up their sleeves for direct memory access their competitor doesn’t have as they own the whole ecosystem.TLDR; Wait foIt’s not.

AMD is looking very good by reports thus far, and may be the better option for this bracket for this generation of GPUs in price, performance, and energy usage (based on info so far) unless you have a specific need for NVidia hardware - particularly if you’re looking at more than just a GPU and can benefit from the ecosystem bonuses.","68,766 followers",Kanthaswamy Balasubramaniam,898,17.3K,413.3M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-AT-advanced-technology-motherboard

2,"They have the four greatest advantages today(a) They have the Required Money for Research and Development(b) They have the Brains available to handle advanced Research - most of whom have learnt requisite skills from Foreign Countries and are ready to further the education for millions of chinese.(c) They have a Low Saturation Point since they were barely technology sufficient even 5 years ago. This means they have a(d) They have the worlds largest Capable populationBut their greatest Advantage - UNITYChinese Nationalism is trulyThey have the four greatest advantages today(a) They have the Required Money for Research and Development(b) They have the Brains available to handle advanced Research - most of whom have learnt requisite skills from Foreign Countries and are ready to further the education for millions of chinese.(c) They have a Low Saturation Point since they were barely technology sufficient even 5 years ago.

Because they have a very hungry demand and loads of money and a very intelligent and trained populace.",0 followers,Lucas Martin,6.4K,65,4.2M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-AT-advanced-technology-motherboard
3,"It depends from the sphere, but in general we can say: YES, Russia is technically advanced.There are several sectors in which you can find excellence in Russia. The first I would mention is IT sector. The level of programmers in Russia is at the top of the world. Kasperskiy is probabily the best antivirus. Abby and their system for automatic recognization of hand writing are the best. 1C:EnterprisIt depends from the sphere, but in general we can say: YES, Russia is technically advanced.There are several sectors in which you can find excellence in Russia.

5,"You don’t advance technology as a monolith. Germany is a leader in material science and mechanical engineering.Germany is sub-par in software engineering and in its physical communication infrastructure. This is in part due to persistent cultural wariness of surveillance technologies like social media. People aren’t keen to fund the infrastructure to make mass surveillance easier, and politicians don’t want to be seen as pushing for the capability.Germany also has the capability to advance nuclear technology, but doesn’t due to mass scientific illiteracy among the voting population that falselYou don’t advance technology as a monolith.

Germany is not the most technologically advanced country. It could be pretty close, but there are major elements of society who dedicate themselves to making sure that Germany uses inferior technology that kills more people, damages the environment more, costs more money, and will cause the total collapse of Earth’s biosphere due to a runaway greenhouse effect. Mostly in the Green Party. Because radiation from nuclear accidents is apparently scarier than way more people dying of regular pollution constantly and the total annihilation of all life on Earth as the oceans boil away.","1,594 followers",Michael Van In,632,1.5K,2.9M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-AT-advanced-technology-motherboard
