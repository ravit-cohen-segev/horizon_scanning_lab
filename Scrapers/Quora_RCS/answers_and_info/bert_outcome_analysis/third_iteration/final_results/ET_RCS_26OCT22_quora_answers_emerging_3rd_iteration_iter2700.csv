Your money would last longer if you live in third or fourth tier cities, which is actually much bigger and more advanced than most third or fourth tier cities in the west. China’s technology is not more or less advance than the west, but in China, the use of new technology is more wide spread.

Chinese are also leading in the amount of intellectual property patents for design and industrial engineering and again going ahead of US. More than 60% of the papers written in steel industry belong to Chinese research engineers.They have huge technological companies which can go one on one with their equivalent Us ones . For example like Alibaba (Amazon), Baidu (Google), Xiaomi (Apple), Tucent(Facebook), Did Chuxing (Uber),Youku(youtube and Netflix), QQ(Spotify) etc. The list goes on. These companies are financially as strong or sometimes stronger than their American counterparts. Having access to such a large population helps. That the government helps by restricting competition from outside definitely helps a lot.This domination does not end just in technological sector. Siemens and Alsthom had to merge in September this year (2017) to counter CRRC in the high speed rail building industry. This merger will bring a 18billion$ competitor to CRRC which is having an annual revenue of 35billion$. They are very active in infrastructure projects in Africa where the western world is not so involved.The government is stable and enforcing technological advancement with authority (of course it is difficult to enforce such things so hard in democratic countries). Intelligent Steel making , Indistry 4.0 , Driverless Electric buses (running in Taiyuan), Electric Taxis all are examples of Government backed advances. Sometimes experiments fail like the straddling bus in Qinhuangdao. But then such steps help technological advancement.So I would not say that Chinese are the most technologically advanced country yet.

It has to bend to them, meet them at least half-way … Seeing a rotten picture for the special effects is like eating a tough steak for the smothered onions, or reading a bad book for the dirty parts. Optical wizardry is something a movie can do that a book can’t but it is no substitute for a story, for logic, for meaning. It is ornamentation, not substance. In fact, whenever a science fiction picture is praised overeffusively for its special effects, I know it’s a bad picture. Is that all they can find to talk about?” — ""Editorial: The Reluctant Critic"", in Isaac Asimov’s Science Fiction Magazine, Vol. 2, Issue 6, (12 November 1978)“Science fiction offers its writers chances of embarrassment that no other form of fiction does.” — Robot Dreams (1986), introduction“There is more to a science fiction story than the science it contains. There is also the story.” — Robot Dreams (1986), introduction“Individual science fiction stories may seem as trivial as ever to the blinder critics and philosophers of today — but the core of science fiction, its essence has become crucial to our salvation, if we are to be saved at all.”“What’s important about science fiction, even crucial, is the very thing that gave it birth-the perception of change through technology. It is not that science fiction predicts this particular change or that that makes it important, it is that it predicts change. It is change, continuing change inevitable change, that is the dominant factor in society today. No sensible decision can be made any longer without taking into account not only the world as it is, but the word as it will be – and naturally this means that there must be an accurate perception of the world as it will be. This, in turn, means that our statesmen, our businessmen, our Everyman, must take on a science fictional way of thinking, whether he likes it or not or even whether he knows it or not.

9,"Science fiction is about people. When it's set in the future, It allows us to explore the human response to different situations without preconceived notions based on current or past politics. It lets us imagine how changing one past situation or decision in the past could change the world we live in. Think of the best episodes of “Star Trek” or “The Twilight Zone” - just for a common example: those stories made us think, not just about the future or technology, but about how we exist and behave in our own time.",0 followers,Tamara M,2.1K,101,14.1M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Is-China-making-the-most-advanced-technology
10,"Neither. A work of science fiction does not need any mention of technology at all, whether past, current, or future, super or ordinary. And it can stay entirely within known science.Robert Heinlein famously stated that a work of science fiction can be put into at least one of three categories -What if?If only, then…If this goes on, then…I think most of what is called science fiction falls into a fourth category - the same old stories in a futuristic setting.
