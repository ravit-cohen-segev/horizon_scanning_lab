Gambesons can look a bit dopey and cumbersome, giving the fearsome warriors these big fat arms, and that’s going to put off a lot of costume depts and directors. A bigger problem is that they are unpleasant for actors to wear for any length of time under studio lights or in battle scenes. You have to imagine how hot these things get.Studios would rather their heroes and main characters wear form-fitting “leather/fur armours” if they aren’t going out in mail or plate.

But these would be normal, even predictable kinds of catastrophes punctuating a “normal” life which would be essentially unchanged from time immemorial.The major exception would be in Medieval Christendom, where people were given a Biblical template for the future. What they saw was the end of the world. Some day, they believed, there would be a series of events involving various signs and portents followed by the second coming of Christ, and God would shut down the world, sending everybody on to their final destination who hadn’t already gone to one.

However I’ll choose the period immediately before the Black Death and the immense shortage of labour which followed it.Finally I would like to make the response from the point of view of a successful yeoman farmer who owned some land and probably controlled a small number of serfs too. In other words a person just like me – but without the serfs!In this period things were considerably easier than had you been looking at Anglo-Saxon England where for example, slave trading and slave ownership were mainstream activities.So to the first part of the question.Was this period really precarious? The answer was unequivocally yes. There was a knowledge of agricultural improvement techniques but this was very sketchy. For example, the three field system was widely used where crops were rotated and land was left fallow.There was also a knowledge of fertiliser the use of which was highly regarded and so protected.Even so a mediaeval plough could only barely scratch the surface of an arable field and this made growing crops vulnerable to adverse weather and disease.The actual act of sowing was also inconsistent. A serf walked the rows of four rows scattering seed rhythmically in the hope that the ground was neither over nor under supplied with the precious seed.It’s small wonder that people of this era had a close relationship to their God because they needed all the help they could get for the seed to become a usable crop. And if it didn’t they went hungry.The same applied to raising livestock. Mediaeval farmers no doubt knew a lot about helping sheep and cows to give birth but even so they lacked antibiotics and anything but the most rudimentary veterinary knowledge.There was no social support except perhaps some help from a very generous and community spirited nobleman – and these did exist – so if the weather was inclement, or even extreme, this would be a disaster for the community.The same applied to extreme weather damaging houses and fencing: there was no-one to help you, except your neighbours, when things went wrong.There was medical care, and herb based medicines were widely used, but there were ample ways are becoming very ill.I was reminded of the value of modern antibiotics during the height of the Covid 19 pandemic. I had been clipping the hoof of one of our sheep and nicked my finger: nothing very dramatic there. I cleaned the cut and thought no more about it – until it became infected. When I eventually made it to hospital they said I was a few hours away from septicaemia and its potentially fatal consequences – and all this from a tiny cut which came into contact with an infected hoof.Similar injuries would have been a daily occurrence in the high Middle Ages.There were also innumerable problems from being close to livestock. Danish archaeologists found a huge number of infestations in the faeces of animals and humans. Avoiding microbial infections and infestations was why the production of small beer – which was effectively sterilised and flavoured water – was so important.Added to these challenges were the dangers posed by brigands. People tended to stay in their own locality but even so there were real dangers.

That shock begins what we call the Terrible Twos, where every response we offer back begins with the word NO.At four we usually reach the point of understanding that our acts can cause others pain.

Grandpa went to heaven, but he’s not every coming back.Puberty persuades us that the opposite gender, instead of objectionable in every way, offers certain opportunities for gratification. Both sexes manage to objectify each other, but males objectifying females is much easier to identify, since “the male principle” is “active.” Don’t look at me, that’s right out of Asia.The basis for all future interaction is the increasing need to realize that, beyond our four-year-old selves, the business about causing other people pain shrouds itself in an ever-broader, ever-more-subtle social context.

I mean, if we didn’t have this response, well,I say ‘These are allOur brain, however, is kind enough to still respond to these factors. Just in-case. In effect,Let’s update it then…But there’s a problem. We can’t quite reach into our brains and start to tweak what’s inside so that we don’t get scared, or so that we don’t forgot our speech. We have to tap into our physiology and attract change from there. After all, being scared is good. It’s very good, it makes us scared to be close to big drops and it keeps us from doing something severely stupid.(A photo from the top of Burj Khalifa:There are two main ways you can take control of your physiology.Breathing:Breathing, I find, is rather strange.

Studies have shown that although the rate of breathing does not directly affect our heartrate, theYou’ve probably taken a few short breaths here and there when you feel you’re about to enter a tough situation, just to calm yourself down.There are a number of ways you can control your breathing. In-fact, there are 12 breathingRhythmBy doing the above, you will be“what are you on about, nothing dangerous here, go back to bed brain”.So, that’s one. Breathing can force your primitive brain to be kicked out of control. Not really, but you areYou have understand that most of the time, when your primitive brain is starting to respond to anxiety, you oftenMy point is, whenever you think you may enter a stressful or nervous situation; sort out your breath accordingly and the rest will work just as fine.Moving onto the second point.(This is Bobby. You will be introduced to him below).Practice.Consider how an experienced public speaker, lets call himJimmy, the professional, will walk on stage,Bobby, isn't. He’s flapping behind Jimmy’s shadow, hoping no one notices him. His brains going through all sorts of thinking. Bobby is slouched, words don’t come out. He’s forcing a smile but instead looks like TheWhat’s the difference between Jimmy and Bobby then? Why has Jimmy managed to get rid of all basic physiological responses of a nervous situation?Put that same monitor on Bobby, you’d be surprised his alive. The answer is, Jimmy has been on that stage 1001 times. He’s had that walk up the stairs many, many times. He’s brain has learnt that there is nothing scary about this. “No need to worry Jimmy, you’ve done this a 1001 times before”, his brain would say.Bobby? Well: “WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS? GET OUT, BOBBY, LEAVE NOW”.Dramatic? Yes. But practicing really does make a difference. You want to become good at public speaking,Do you want to become an actor? ThenThat’s the second pointSo to answer the questionYes, you can manipulate the more primitive part of the brain. The more reptilian part.You can change your breathing style or you can practice being in the situation that sets of your fight or flight response.I hope this answered helped.

The structural framework is a cage so even a large explosion from a missle would only take out a few structural members and slowly deflate large numbers of gas bags.

The hindenburg can maybe do 100+ tonnes although its disputed. Potentially you could make a dirigible with a 500–1000 tonne payload, more than enough for a reactor and shielding.Third advantage is longer length. This means the crew is farther from the reactor and less shielding is required.With today’s technology, the structure itself could be made of lighter carbon fiber. Maybe 25% lighter??? Not sure. And the reactor could be made a little more energy dense i.e. lighter for the same power.I don’t know what would be lighterBut lighter than air craft still have their intrinsic disadvantages.
