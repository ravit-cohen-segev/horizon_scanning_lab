For a better idea of what 5G is capable compared to previous networks when downloading a 2-hour movie:Once the 5G signal towers are built, Huawei’s future 5G compatible smartphones will be able to take full advantage of that.Due to the ban placed on Huawei by the United States Government that is forbidding US companies from cooperating, Huawei is no longer able to use the Android OS. In order to continue making smartphones, Huawei has begun to develop its own operating system known as Harmony OS.However, Harmony OS is completely new so it will take a few years in order for it to mature and for apps to be developed in order to compete with IOS and Andriod OS.Hardware:It seems that every major smartphone company is adding more and more cameras to their phones.e.g Apple: 2–3 camerase.g Samsung: 2–4 camerase.g Huawei: 2–4 camerasBased on this pattern, in the near future, I highly suspect that Huawei will add more cameras to their phones. However, in the far future, there will be a time when smartphone companies can no longer add more cameras due to restrictions in screen size.Huawei is the only smartphone company to have made a significant improvement in screen technology with the new wraparound screen that completely destroyed the need for a physical power button and volume button. In the future, I think they will continue to improve and increase this aspect. Maybe when the cameras cannot be expanded any longer they will try to expand the screen? ;)As for the notch, there isn’t really a reliable method to completely remove it, however, some companies have tried going the way of making a pop-up camera in exchange for full-screen availability.Conclusion:Software:Hardware:Sources:Images:Information:",18 followers,Asim Qureshi,4.1K,996,156.1M,2020,https://www.quora.com/How-are-Amazon-Google-Sony-and-eBay-using-emerging-technology-to-sustain-their-business

And in that respect the US is far, far ahead. Others such as the EU, Russia or Japan also make significant contribution to the research and development in IT. China also is increasingly becoming a significant player (particularly in communications technologies and robotics/drones) but still nowhere close to the US.Given the strength of the Indian IT sector, India has the potential to make significant contribution to development in computing, communication technologies, robotics, etc (as they do in the US). For this to happen however the Indian education system will have to move on from regarding education as process of gather knowledge to one that imparts analytical and critical thinking skills. In other words, replace learning to pass exams to learning how technology works and how it can serve to solve problems!","84,238 followers",Igor Markov,3.3K,3.9K,49.8M,2018,https://www.quora.com/How-are-Amazon-Google-Sony-and-eBay-using-emerging-technology-to-sustain-their-business
