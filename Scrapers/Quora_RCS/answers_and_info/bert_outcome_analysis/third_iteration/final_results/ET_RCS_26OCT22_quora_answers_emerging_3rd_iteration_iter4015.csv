THE. ACTUAL. JUICEPRESS?!Did y’all forget, what a juicer is about ?!There are people really surprised, that this startup failed. Like what ?EvenThis startup shut down recently, after a few people discovered, that all you need to press juice is … your hands. Yeah, well.I don’t want to bash startups here and pick on people. I appreciate everything startups are doing for us. They’re important, they (sometimes) innovate faster than big companies and so on.But honestly, this thoughtless technologization craze has to stop.This is SMALT - A smart salt shakerNo, my salt shaker does not need bluetooth and a bad, low tier sound box integrated. All it needs to do is give me salt, when I need it to. No, I still won’t buy it even if you call it smalt. There is nothing smart about s(m)alt, my dude.No, my salt shaker does not need Alexa.You know what’s the best part about this thing?Please, Bay Area.

2,"Q: A decade has passed and no concrete technology has come to facilitate our lives. Have we reached the peak of scientific and technological progress?A: 13 years ago, the iPhone was launched. It just completely changed how we live our lives. Ten years before that, the internet was invented, and it too just completely changed our lives. Fifteen years before that, computers were affordable for the ordinary person, and it too just completely changed our lives.One thing to note here is that none of these were concrete technology inventions – computers had been around since the 1940s, computer commQ: A decade has passed and no concrete technology has come to facilitate our lives. Have we reached the peak of scientific and technological progress?A: 13 years ago, the iPhone was launched. It just completely changed how we live our lives. Ten years before that, the internet was invented, and it too just completely changed our lives. Fifteen years before that, computers were affordable for the ordinary person, and it too just completely changed our lives.One thing to note here is that none of these were concrete technology inventions – computers had been around since the 1940s, computer communicating with one another had been around since the 1960s, mobile telephony since the 1980s (and earlier if you count radio telephony). What happened was that they became available to everyone.So what will be the next thing that has existed for decades that will change our lives completely? My guess is AI – not the super-smart conscious thing, but the smart agent in your watch or your phone that will do everything for you that you do yourself, from booking a meeting to getting airplane tickets and order stuff for you. With Siri, Alexa, Cortana and Google Assistant, we’re not far off. We’re not quite there yet though: it needs to go one more step and become such an integrated part of your life that you trust it with your life – like you would a butler ofAnd I don’t think that we’re that far off. Five years, perhaps?

4,"Apple were the first major company to ship products with the USB connector. They adopted it (for the iMac) because it was much better than anything else at the time.But the Micro USB is a terrible design for a consumer product.It is difficult to use. Try plugging one in without looking. It's hard to align, The hollow shape makes it easy to gouge the device you are trying to attach it to.If you follow the specification, it does not deliver the current needed to charge a device in an adequate amount of time.And it really isn't a physically robust design.  It's fragile.So ... Apple rejectedApple were the first major company to ship products with the USB connector.

5,"There will be an endless stream of Windows-loving cynics who will tell you that this is Apple’s evil “lock in” to get you to buy their peripherals/adapters, etc. That it’s nothing more than a cash grab by a greedy company who uses proprietary solutions for the sole purpose of shutting out other vendors.But this lazy bit of anlaysis is missing a much larger point. Typically Apple only does its own thing when the thing everyone else is doing isn’t good enough.

Typically Apple only does its own thing when the thing everyone else is doing isn’t good enough. Sometimes when the standard thing IS good enough, Apple’s the one out there promoting it and leading the way for that standard.A lot of people don’t remember it, but when the first iMac came out it had one type of port on it–a kind other computers did not have. It was scandalous. People were outraged. It would force peripheral manufacturers to retool and make their devices compatible with this new kind of port. There was no other choice. if they wanted to be compatible with the iMac, they had to do it.What was this new, evil port that forced everyone to change? USB. And it wasn’t proprietary. It was a standard that could be used by everyone. It was created by a group of industry leaders like Intel, Microsoft, Compaq, Apple and Hewlett-Packard.Problem was, nobody put USB ports on their computers because there were no peripheral devices that used it. And peripheral manufacturers didn’t use USB because no computers had the ports.So Apple stepped in to be a leader and make a computer that had NO other ports on it. Just all in on USB. Why? So they could lock you in to their proprietary evil ecosystem? No. Because USB was just plain better than serial ports.So the next time you use a standard USB device thank Apple for leading the way.",0 followers,Dexter Liew,868,782,2.6M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Do-you-believe-technology-has-a-certain-peak-or-maximum-capacity-to-which-it-cant-progress-any-further
6,"Apple is usually first to remove ports that are on the way out.Ethernet disappeared because the connector is too large to fit the thin form factors that Apple prefers.USB A and HDMI connectors vanished for the same reason, replaced the the more adaptable USB Type-C. HDMI can’t handle the modern resolutions that Thunderbolt can.Modern wireless protocols are faster than the wired ports of yesteryear.Buy an adapter if you are stuck in the past. Apple will not be constrained by obsolete connectors.","31,158 followers",Phillip Remaker,503,11K,78.8M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Do-you-believe-technology-has-a-certain-peak-or-maximum-capacity-to-which-it-cant-progress-any-further
