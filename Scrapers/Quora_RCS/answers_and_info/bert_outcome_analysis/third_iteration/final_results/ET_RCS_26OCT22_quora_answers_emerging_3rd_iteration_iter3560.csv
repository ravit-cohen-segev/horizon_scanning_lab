3,"With current technology we could make airplanes that run on electrical power drawn from wires strung along streets and highways. Wires don’t need to touch to draw power our of the field surrounding wires transmitting electricity. They just have to be close. Computer controlled power “receivers” could glide along just above the wires and transmit power by wire to an electric powered plane just above. The plane would have batteries for interuptions. It is technically feasible but not commercially practical so you have never heard of it and no doubt, never will.","90,349 followers",Alisha Talks,4.7K,910,103.9M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Where-can-I-post-ad-for-any-kind-of-advanced-technology-Team-to-make-my-ideas

7,"No none.There may be some creative pursuits or lost arts that existed in the past which we are unaware of today, an example would be recipes.The closest I’m aware of for technologies comparable with the modern age is the Minoan civilisation but it is most definitely less than today.These are some example in the archaeological archive compared to the time it was available (some were rediscovered after falling out of use around bronze age collapse).To be clear there are not many technologies and all of them exist today. These really should have been kept alive as they are such useful things, butNo none.There may be some creative pursuits or lost arts that existed in the past which we are unaware of today, an example would be recipes.The closest I’m aware of for technologies comparable with the modern age is the Minoan civilisation but it is most definitely less than today.These are some example in the archaeological archive compared to the time it was available (some were rediscovered after falling out of use around bronze age collapse).To be clear there are not many technologies and all of them exist today. These really should have been kept alive as they are such useful things, but were rediscovered MUCH later in history.Longest: fibreglass being invented in 1950 CE.The team that reproduced this half-scale reproduction craft, from a fresco in Thera (Santorini) believed flax linen cloth was used, held in a pine resin matrix infused with limestone powders to skin the outer hull over a wooden frame (that may have been applied internally too according to one of the ships in the fresco).This is not unreasonable, Minoans used composites for shields (leather/wicker) and in building structures too, they are the material scientists and engineers of the ancient world, they also produced fine cloths for export inventing murex purple.Flax linen cloth is almost as strong in tension as fibreglass. All things considered, I think there is a good possibility that this was a technology the Minoans used. The limited literary sources seem to refer to white bulls which may be the name that was applied to the ships that charged across the sea, I also note that the ship Theseus returned in was kept in Athens for many generations (until it decayed) which implies that it was not a normal ship but a prize as it may show how Minoan shipyards constructed these hulls, in any event, no other civilisation seems to be able to construct these hulls and may have remained a secret of Minoan shipyards, likely controlled by the Palace.This example is the most speculative, an ancient technology which is potentially used before 1628BCE using natural materials as composites, that would not be ‘invented’ until 1950 using glass-fiber.Minoan hydro works are considered to be comparable with those in Europe of the 18th century. They include cisterns, channels directly through hills, aqueducts, freshwater to dwelling (including volcanic hot water at Akrotiri, Thera), sealed interlocking clay pipes and an early form of concrete (using clay as the binder with pumice but no modified lime), upstairs toilets, sewers, and fountains for natural cooling.Prisms made from precision ground rock-crystal were found in Idaean mountain workshops, ca 1500BCE, the lens found (below) in a nearby cave are dated to 1350BCE, but this maybe when they are stored in the cave. The wedge crescent-shaped example will reproduce a rainbow. Prisms are more generally considered to be created around the time of Newton, 1500CE, not 1500BCE.A number of rooms have been identified in Palaces known as light and dark rooms, it appears that the Minoans were also splitting light into its spectrum and studying its properties. Having looked at there technologies in some detail, their optics are particularly good, they use simple techniques to achieve some rather interesting results, for example using water bowls to study the passage of Venus in front of the Sun in the soft reflection. It is as if they know what they want to achieve and possibly task workshops that utilise natural materials or a simple arrangement which will give them a new capability. There understanding of astronomy and the solar system is likely on a par with that of the time of Newton, by example, they have articulated all the periods that the Antikythera mechanism will use over a millennium later. Technically they are very accomplished for the time.OK, these are specific technologies that do seem to fall out of use in later periods and particularly around bronze age collapse. One slightly speculative example is comparable with fibreglass invented in 1950, the others are around the time of the European renaissance and industrial revolution. What this shows is the Minoans were rather advanced for their time, wealthy - all of these technologies require a considerable resource to produce, but had no technology which eclipses that of today. Still, I’m rather impressed by what they had.","43,426 followers",Misha Firer,5.1K,1.3K,133.8M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Where-can-I-post-ad-for-any-kind-of-advanced-technology-Team-to-make-my-ideas

They then postulate some amazing “secret” technology that archaeologists are “hiding” or “suppressing.” The reality is that thereMany people confound our modern technology with the ability to immense engineering projects that could not be done with less sophisticated means. This is an error. Modern technology evolves primarily to reduce the time a project requires, and the personnell required to complete it. That is, we do it faster, with fewer people. But what we do is primarily well within the capacity of less sophisticated technology. What is a failure is the inabilifty of the modern mind to imagination HOW something could be done other than by modern methods.","5,990 followers",Jens Böttiger,566,2.6K,17.6M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-importance-of-advanced-technology-in-giving-us-evidence-of-past-events
