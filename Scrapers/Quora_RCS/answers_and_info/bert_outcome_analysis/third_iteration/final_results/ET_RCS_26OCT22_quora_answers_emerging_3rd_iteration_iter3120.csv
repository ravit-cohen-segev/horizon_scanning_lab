Because fully devNo.Online you might find many Chinese brag about this:And thisThen they exclaim, that there are more skyscrapers, high speed trains, etc. in China than America, so they are developed.This is not the right definition of ‘developed’You don’t measure a city or country by outer appearance alone. The thing is we have to take a look at the innards of a country to really know whether or not you are truly developed. That Chinese are so obsessed with portraying the facade that they are technologically advanced and ahead is actually an indication that they have not fully developed yet. Because fully developed countries have no need to show off things like that. Everyone knows they are developed.For example, here is San Francisco:Look, not many skyscrapers right? And look at those old cable cars going around! That must mean they are undeveloped right? Nope. Everyone knows San Francisco is a developed city. That’s why it has no need to show off with luxury skyscrapers and such things.Or how about Florence, Italy?Again, no skyscrapers here. But everyone knows it’s a developed city and Italy is a developed country.My point is, you have got to look at the people and the innards of a country to truly know if they are developed.This is the true face of China:You have got to look at the average person. Does the average Chinese have good access to healthcare (which is ranked near the bottom in WHO rankings btw)? Can they drink tap water safely? Do they have access to quality food? Do all have access to electricity or paved roads or a quality education? The answer is: probably, yes, if you are living in the rich east coast provinces of Jiangsu or Zhejiang or Guangdong- but not if you are living in say - Xinjiang or Gansu or Tibet. China’s wealth is not spread equally, neither is it developed equally. Even though the CCP has developed China quite fast - there is still a lot of work to be done making sure *every Chinese* have equal access to everything.And then you got to look at the attitude of the people. When I was in China I found that you really got to look out for who you trust, because there is a lot of scams going on all the time. You never know what is real, what is fake, what is real price of anything. Why do these scams exist? Because people have to be desperate to make money that’s why.Why are people desperate to make money? Probably because they are not making enough to survive, which is an indication that the country is still developing. You’ll notice that in general, the more developed a country is, the less likely there will be scams. In Korea/Japan/Taiwan, you will not find very many scams. In China and Eastern Europe it’s likely.Another aside I want to note is that Chinese bathrooms don’t contain any toilet paper. Do you know the reason why? It’s because people steal it. Now, in what developed country does this happen? I can’t think of any. Only in a developing country would you need to bring your own toilet paper to the bathroom because there isn’t any there due to fear of people stealing it.I find GDP/capita to be generally a pretty good indicator of how developed a country is. The average GDP/capita (PPP) of China is still around $8k/person. While that is higher than most Asian countries - it’s still below the 4 East Asian tigers + Japan and far from the $62k/person that the USA has.The true measure of a developed society is to observe the people that live in the country and not the appearance of the country itself. Chinese “face” culture is the same. You can just obviously see that China has developed really really fast, and mentality wise people are still harping about luxury products and consumerism - this is where Americans were back in the 50s, 60s and 70s, not now.The biggest consumers of luxury products are Chinese people, not Americans or Europeans. The more developed you are, the less need you have to validate your self worth with materialism. The less desire you have to spend thousands of dollars on your children's schooling just to send them to be educated abroad. The less need to travel to countries like Canada or USA for giving birth so that your child becomes a US or Canadian citizen, or to launder your money by buying up real estate in other countries. Developed countries do not need to do things like that.Thats why you should always pay attention to the old adage -Edit:Of course, Chinese commenters love to bring up the USA. Yes, USA has lots of impoverished areas too; every country has developed areas and undeveloped areas, however my point is that for China there is significantly more undeveloped areas at a higher % compared to the USA. The poverty rate for China is 16% as of 2019 and for USA it is 1.5% as of 2019.

4,"Yes. Pakistan can become a developed country, far more developed than India, even when India is far ahead right now. For this Pakistan government has to take some hard decisions and policy changes. There are some short term steps and some long term. Remember that India was near bankrupt in 1991 and today is hugely successful - long way to go still but blooming.(There are some comparisons to India which are inevitable but the comparison is not to demean Pakistan; rather to show the way to emulate.)Cut down on India rhetoric:Yes. Pakistan can become a developed country, far more developed than India, even when India is far ahead right now. For this Pakistan government has to take some hard decisions and policy changes.

Remember that India was near bankrupt in 1991 and today is hugely successful - long way to go still but blooming.(There are some comparisons to India which are inevitable but the comparison is not to demean Pakistan; rather to show the way to emulate.)Cut down on India rhetoric:Focus on own people:Edit: A rather nasty and abusive comment I received was about happiness. The person quoted World Happiness Index figures and how Pakistan was way ahead than India. He told me to go and build toilets and then f*** myself. My current answer is very sincerely meant. To that misguided person my only answer is that if you are happy with the state of affairs in Pakistan, the state of the economy, the crashing PKR, then what can I say? Be happy and let things run its course.Land Reforms:Education:Women Education:Infrastructure Development:But ports, roads and bridges are not the only infra. Pakistan has to focus on power including renewable sources, irrigation, housing development, development of new cities, etc. India lags here too.Give up on Terror; hug peace:Forget Kashmir. Increase Trade with India:There are a few more options. Not all are simple. Not all may bring immediate benefits but in the long run they will. It is a matter of setting aside the ego.Edit 2 (30-May-2019):The whole thing has been misunderstood. The rhetoric lies in the minds of the Establishment and not general populace (maybe). The survival of the Army Generals depends upon the anti India stance. Let me also explain how India rhetoric, the unbalanced arms race, terror funding, etc., have crippled Pakistan.In 1985, the Per Capita GDP of Pakistan was about 27.7% higher than India’s (Pak US$350 : Ind US$274). Today, the Pakistan per capita GDP is some US$ 1222.50 and forecasted to grow to US$ 1400 in 2020 while India’s PCGDP is US$ 1963.55 and forecasted to grow to US$ 2350 in 2020. India is 60.1% ahead. How did Pakistan lose out by about 88%?Pakistan, while a smaller nation, is a much blessed nation. Almost whole land is fertile, it has a unique geographic advantageous location, it is rich in minerals, its population is lower (but growing at an alarming rate 2.5 times of India), the problems are lower, etc. Smaller nations grow much more than larger nations. The growth rate till 1985 was about 6% and exceeded India’s measly 2.75%.It was around this time (1985) that Pakistan started funding terrorism against India and started the Kashmiri insurgency heavily. They also started heavy military purchases including the F-16s. Pakistan's general thought that we won the war in Afghanistan by attrition. We can do the same to India. The US was funding Pakistan to fight against Afghans. Some of the heavy funding was to take care of the huge Afghan refugees. But a lot of these funds were misused and ended in terror funding or the corrupt. Pakistan still had to shelter the refugees. The money came from the exchequer.This is what I mean by India rhetoric and it is deeply coupled with Kashmir.People have also questioned on terror and how IK is sincere and wanting to talk and Modi isn't. There are reasons for this. Why did the bus to Lahore in 1999 end up in Kargil? The Kashmir problem was almost solved at that time. Who helped the attack on J&K assembly and later the Indian Parliament? Who sent terrorists to Mumbai on 26/11/2008? Modi invited Nawaz Sharif and he gracefully agreed. Yet pretty soon there were Uri, Pathankot incidents and later Pulwama. Pakistan can’t honestly say that they were ‘freedom fighters’ fighting alone. JeM have taken responsibility of these events. Pakistan can’t hide behind excuses such as ‘give us the proofs’. Where do all these people get the training and logistics support? How is 240+ kg of RDX, detonators, timing devices obtained and where does the training to assemble it come from?Pakistan is always in denial mode. They denied whereabouts of Osama Bin Laden. What happened exactly?All this not only creates mistrust but that logistics support to “freedom fighters” is costing huge amount of money. The army/ISI can’t provide their own arms to the terrorists; they provide funds. The terrorists buy their arms and ammunition from global arms dealers at open market (much higher) price. Hence they require more money - the same money that could be used to build better roads, dams, canals, higher educational institutes, etc.Just a fortnight ago, Pakistan got some $6 billion from IMF and the first result was deep PKR devaluation. What is $6 billion? It is loose change for tea/coffee. A similar sum was spent by Laxmi Mittal to purchase the bankrupt Essar Steel of India. And yet, this money was direly needed. It has come with deep consequences. We went thru same crisis in 1991 and I know what happened. How long will this money last. Without fresh global investments, Pakistan will have to back to IMF in a year. The world views Pakistan as an unsafe place. Reality may be different but perceptions matter.Just imagine ... if peace accord had been signed in 1999. The Iran-Pakistan-India gas pipeline would have been complete - bringing huge revenues for Pakistan. A road transit would have been created from New Delhi to Central Asia bringing customs duty, cess and road tolls to Pakistan. These two would have earned more than $6b per annum. This is the benefit of bilateral trade.I have told to forget Kashmir and India. Cut down on (useless) defence spending.I could go on. My answer and advice is to take good things. India is not perfect; in fact, it is very far from perfect.","113,616 followers",Anuradha Tiwari,4.2K,0,0,2020,https://www.quora.com/Why-might-advanced-technology-be-negatively-viewed-in-a-developing-country
