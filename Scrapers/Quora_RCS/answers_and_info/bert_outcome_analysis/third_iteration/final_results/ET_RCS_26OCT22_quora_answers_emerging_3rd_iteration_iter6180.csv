Either pay to acquire the opportunity or hire the professionals to do it for you.Process process process.Align the financial interest of your original co-conspirators, and hire professionals to execute on process process and more process.Strength is predicated on the conservation of strength, don’t burn yourself out being right about the minutiae. Hire the professionals, right or wrong they will get the job done.The progress of science is predicated on the specialization of knowledge. Hire the specialists. If by this point you are a generalist, either go deeper on the areas of interest to you, work on your blindspots, or go back to being specialized and leave everything else to professional managers.When in doubt, waste all your available time talking to customers. Unlike the people that you have surrounded yourself with, they will not lie to you. They will tell you want value they want, and its your business to inform them of what it will cost to provide that value.The market never lies. It will always tell you what you do not want to hear. Occasionally the market will throw you a bone and let you know what it wants,Wants require 10x the marketing effort,Thanks for the ask always a pleasure.","135,547 followers",Hector Quintanilla,1.4K,1.2K,88.6M,2019,https://www.quora.com/How-does-the-emerging-technology-start-up-companies-operate-during-the-slow-quarter-low-volume-of-customer-order
2,"A delightful question, and here is an answer which I put forth as a ""rule of thumb.""In an upturn, the successful company will supply what people WANT, at the price the company demands.But in a downturn, the successful company will sell what people NEED, at the lowest market price.The important thing is to know which way the wave is running, and to be on the right side of it.Hope that helps.",18 followers,Asim Qureshi,2.4K,996,156.1M,2016,https://www.quora.com/How-does-the-emerging-technology-start-up-companies-operate-during-the-slow-quarter-low-volume-of-customer-order

7,"It can be very risky if you do it the wrong way.Case Study: Opening a Gym (The risky path)Let’s say you want to start a gym business. The location close to the train station seems a good spot as many people are travelling by train to work. You have the opportunity to rent a great place there, however, you have to sign a contract for 2 years with a rent of $3000/mo. This does not matter too much, as you calculated that you will easily find 300 people which will sign a 2-year contract for $100/month. You contact a company that is leasing fitness equipment and you sign another contract for $4000/It can be very risky if you do it the wrong way.Case Study: Opening a Gym (The risky path)Let’s say you want to start a gym business.

This does not matter too much, as you calculated that you will easily find 300 people which will sign a 2-year contract for $100/month. You contact a company that is leasing fitness equipment and you sign another contract for $4000/mo for 2 years. So your monthly are at least $7000/month for the next 2 years. You are sure that you will make a profit as the breakeven is just 70 customers. A few months later you find out that a big fitness chain opens a new gym around the corner offering contracts for $50. Things are bad and you just find 20 customers, because your marketing sucks and as you don’t have money for marketing. After a few months, you stop the business, but you still have to pay the contracts. End of the story is that you are financially ruined.Case Study: Opening a Gym (The risk-free path)You are a clever guy and you want to reduce the risks. Before signing any contracts you validate the business idea. For the different locations, you design flyers that link to webpages. You test how many people are interested in a gym in each location and what price they are willing to pay. You do that just for a handful of prospects to get an idea what’s working or not working. Learning is your ultimate goal in the beginning. Once you have the right location and price, you take also the expenses into the calculation. Then you design another webpage and more flyers. But this time you let the people sign a real contract and let them even pay, with something like “Our gym opens in March next year. You get a 30% discount if you sign the contract now” If you can get enough customers you can rent a place and the equipment. In case you cannot find enough customers you pay the customers that already signed the money back.

It’s tough.We started raising money in January 2008. The environment for fundraising was still pretty good and we got a term sheet ($11M ) in April of 2008.All we needed was one more investor to close the round. Then the world started changing. The fund raising environment got ugly fast.We found a second investor in August of 2008. I was ecstatic! But…Our first investor didn’t want to work with the second investor.I’ll never forget the phone call from the first investor. “Brett, I just don’t feel comfortable working with the [first investor].”I instantly knew we were in for a long winter.And we were in for a long winter. The fund raising environment didn’t thaw until around June of 2009.And it was a slow thaw of the fund raising. Investor were still skittish for a long time. And it didn’t help we were a semiconductor company trying to raise funds where investors were already shying away from semiconductor investments.It took us another six months (and 63 rejections) to raise our funds. We ended up raising $12M.We had the wind at our backs after the funds were raised.And in many ways, I was right. Rent was cheap. We had less competition, and we had a relatively easy time hiring top talent.I remember telling the team, “Raising the money is toughest thing we will ever have to do.”How wrong could I be.

Mainly two things, analysis and then creating products on the basis of that.What is done with the data collected? Every site like quora wants to see an exponentially increasing number of active users everyday! So they first take the information you provide them with, to optimize a few parameters based on user engagement. They first want to note the impact of their site and the reliability you assign to it. (When I say the data “you provide them”, I mean the data that comes to them from your facebook connect and what you do on the site.) This way, employees define parameters that would monitor the site’s development and success.Then comes analytics. This is mainly concerned with making sense of data collected or working with it in a fairly static way. Any data-driven business makes its future plan based on this analysis. The data is either organized and structured or played around with a little to create visualizations. These may include numbers depicting virality of the site or actions that it is carrying out.The company then works on the parameters it earlier defined for it’s success. Here comes the requirement for stats from the previous step of analysis and a good programming skills. The employees gain an accurate and deep understanding of the users of the site. They then go on to recommend actions to a user, given their characteristics. The data scientists are hence engaged to create products that increases user-engagement with viral referrals. They need to achieve things real quick though. Models are built by strong coders and software engineers to interact with users and serve them recommendations. That is how the business grows! That is how quora knows what other questions you’d like to answer or whom you’d want to follow. That is what data scientists work for!Quora, Facebook and so many other sites! They all do use Big data tools to understand more about you and provide you with a feed that you in theory should find it interesting. That is how data scientists can serve the business. They won’t be very interested in what answers we provide. However, if we (the users) could really understand what the different people are talking about a particular company and its products in the answers, we could somewhat predicts its future earnings and thus the direction in which the stock price would move. That would be a huge advantage to some of us investors.Talking about the actual answers, then maybe this dataset can be used exclusively for research purposes (Commercial purposes are fully excluded). This data can act as a driver for innovation in databases. Information collected hence can be collated and analyzed to enable data-centric decision making.","20,171 followers",Sriraman Madhavan,11.7K,186,7.9M,2016,https://www.quora.com/How-does-the-emerging-technology-start-up-companies-operate-during-the-slow-quarter-low-volume-of-customer-order
