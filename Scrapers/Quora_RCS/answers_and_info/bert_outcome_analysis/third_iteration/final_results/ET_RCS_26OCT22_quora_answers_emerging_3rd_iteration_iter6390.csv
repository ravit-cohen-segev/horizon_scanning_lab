He has digital X-ray equipment so the X-ray techs don't have to wait 20 minutes to develop the old X-ray film.  He has a funky UV light to help seal filling materials quickly.  Lasers have replaced drills for cleaning out some cavities before filling them.  The materials used in the fillings are better than they were just 10 or 15 years ago.It is true that the dentist (and the hygienist) haveThe technology used in a dentist's office has been evolving continuously, just like the technology used in practically every other profession.My dentist uses digital video cameras to do oral inspections.

1,"The reason technology hasn't evolved (much) is that society is actually breaking down. During the Republic and the heyday of the Jedi Order, society is pretty much at its peak. There’s near universal peace and prosperity, and the Jedi help defend the social order. Technology is at its peak then, too.Then you get the Clone Wars and the end of the Republic/birth of the Empire. The Jedi are all dead or dispersed. The Emperor rules everything with an iron death grip. Lots and lots of “stuff” got destroyed during the wars, and there are insufficient means to improve or develop new technologies.

The Emperor rules everything with an iron death grip. Lots and lots of “stuff” got destroyed during the wars, and there are insufficient means to improve or develop new technologies. That's why you see things like Jawas trading old droids. There aren't any new ones.What development there is takes place pretty exclusively on the Empire side. All the R&D money is going to things like Death Stars, which aren't exactly practical on a daily level.Then the Rebels come and start some more fighting. More stuff gets blown up. There's a kind of peace, but it doesn't really hold. The New Order springs up. Now they're repurposing old tech, too. They also spend their money on an even bigger, even stupider mega weapon. They can't even afford clone troopers. They just kidnap babies now to raise into soldiers.So that's it, basically. Two generations spent almost entirely at war will play havoc with any civilization. There’s no real sense of order, other than an authoritarian regime that spends what few resources there are in order to blow up even more resources. Not exactly a recipe for development or technological growth.I'm sure someone will give a better version of this answer with more details, but these are the broad strokes.","1,914 followers",Brett Lissaman,2.7K,472,20M,2017,https://www.quora.com/Why-hasnt-the-dentists-technology-evolved-Its-the-same-but-smaller
2,"There is a theory for Star Wars that technology has reached it’s peak for sometime. Or at leasted it’s advancing at a slow enough pace that its not noticed.Imagine if for the next 100 years we didn’t invent a new type of smart phone, but they just incrementally got better. iPhones going up in numbers every year. No massive improvement, just incremental. In 100 years, you would be able to look back and see a familiar iPhone, less advanced, but familiar. They have speeders that come out every few years that are incremental improvements. Freighters that are slight improvements.Honestly it’s a bitThere is a theory for Star Wars that technology has reached it’s peak for sometime.

New versions come out every few years but they share a ton in common still with early cars from 100 years ago. Now imagine every bit of tech is like that.That’s one theory. There is no more technological revolutions, no more leaps in physics and understanding. Just incremental improvements over hundreds of years.The Death Star was not some ‘discovery’.

3,"Because any technological evolution is irrelevant to the stories. Once you have spaceships, droids, laser weapons, and a few visually cool gadgets, you have the accessories needed to tell the story. The screenwriters have things to do— move the heroes around, set up battles, have sets constructed that are visually stunning for an audience. Worrying about tech evolution is pointless if you’re making a movie. The audience wants to be visually wowed, not given a tour of “how warp drives improved”.",17 followers,Rom Lokken,918,0,0,2021,https://www.quora.com/In-Star-Wars-why-hasnt-technology-evolved-from-the-time-of-the-Old-Republic-to-the-time-of-the-First-Order
4,"I would have to disagree with the answer that things are breaking down. Star wars tech evolves in more subtle ways then we do. Think of it from a creative pov. There are ships with lightspeed, its hard to top that without ruining a beleivable setting. Secondly, the subtle tech upgrades would be things like kolto to bacts for medical, warships are sleeker faster and carry insane firepower. Ships have improved in speed with better freighters. Mandalorian armor has really evolves. There is alot more than these examples out there. But it is definantly not a break down.

7,"Well, I’m part Jewish and I have a terrible memory. I blame it on my people being able to write for over 3000 years.

8,"The critical path for evolution is between conception to conception. A secondary path is environment. I'll loosely call these self and family.How has technology impacted the critical path? Cesarian births allow children to be born that would otherwise not make it down the birth canal. Hence no pressure between baby and canal size.There's little chance that natural immunities will arise for once potentially fatal childhood diseases.Finally, the grandparent effect will likely diminish. Extended family, while important for a lot reasons, is no longer a survival strategy.",3 followers,Samuel Bateman,1.1K,102,56.3K,2022,https://www.quora.com/In-Star-Wars-why-hasnt-technology-evolved-from-the-time-of-the-Old-Republic-to-the-time-of-the-First-Order
9,"Well, there have been some changes.The genes for being able to break down lactose as an adult are becoming more common as a result of keeping animals for dairy.Our brain size is shrinking. Possibly because we now have the ability to store knowledge in other ways (books, computers et.c.)Perhaps not related to technology, but the genes for blonde hair is becoming more common. Probably because blondes do have more fun (or at least are considered more attractive and get more kids).","8,303 followers",Untorne Nislav,1.5K,325,4M,2022,https://www.quora.com/In-Star-Wars-why-hasnt-technology-evolved-from-the-time-of-the-Old-Republic-to-the-time-of-the-First-Order
10,"The more it advances, the faster it advances. For example, in the 19th century a lot of people were trying to determine the rules of electricity. We didn’t even have Ohm’s Law for a great part of that time.Now no one (except high school physics students) has to “study” to figure out what governs the flow of electricity, so they can work on other things.We had to do all calculations by hand - pencil and paper. Now we have computers, so what used to take a week to work out takes seconds at most. (ENIAC, the first electronic digital computer, was developed to compute Naval firing angles.)",405 followers,Steven Witcher,4K,1.6K,2.5M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Why-hasnt-the-dentists-technology-evolved-Its-the-same-but-smaller
11,"Evolution is such a fundamentally slow process that human beings haven’t evolved since before the time of the Pharaohs.If you took an average human from the time of the Pharaohs and compared them to an average human today, there would be many differences. Humans today are taller, stronger, and heavier than back then; mostly because we are better nourished and therefore grow more fully. We also live longer because of clean water, good housing, and the availability of medical care.But none of this is due to evolution! These are all a result of environmental changes, not changes in DNA.","5,085 followers",Bobby Tatro,3.9K,2.2K,45.6M,2019,https://www.quora.com/In-Star-Wars-why-hasnt-technology-evolved-from-the-time-of-the-Old-Republic-to-the-time-of-the-First-Order
