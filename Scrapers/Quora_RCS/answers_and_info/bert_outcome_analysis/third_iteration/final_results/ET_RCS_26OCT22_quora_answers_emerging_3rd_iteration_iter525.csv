They wanted to develop their own solutions. But they couldn’t kick him away from their workstation because he was the PSE.

They were large and everyone had space, but could talk with each other easily.Everyone in our cube was friends. We joked all the time. All of us went out to lunch together daily.The next cube over had “Blake”. One of the developers who sat in that cube said they’d all be in their cube, developing and laughing and having a great time. But as soon as Blake arrived in the morning, it was like a dark raincloud would settle over the cube and all the laughter came to a standstill. No one would talk anymore. If you had a question, you’d go to the developer and ask him quietly, so as not to accidentally set off Blake.I started paying attention in the mornings (we got in around 7:00, Blake got in around 8:30). Sure enough, the guys in the next cube over seemed to be having a great time. They were talking and joking. But as soon as Blake arrived, the chatter ceased.I felt bad for them, but I knew what Blake was like.Then one of our cubemates quit. He didn’t want to, but the offer he got from another company was just too good to pass up.As soon as he left, Blake moved in. He didn’t like the other cube. Those guys were jerks. They weren’t heartbroken to see him go.Soon after he moved in, he started fighting with me and the other cube buddies. We could never tell what would set him off. So we stopped talking to each other. We still went out to lunch with one another, but we never invited him (he always brought his lunch anyway).Eventually he quit, which was a relief.

Now I remind myself that Mercedes have been relatively unchallenged for years, but this is something I would expect from Gunther, not Toto. It’s easy to make decisions when things are good or unchallenged.Despite not agreeing with many of the stewards calls during the season, Christian has managed to keep his composure most of the time. About the worst we see is Christian nodding his head or putting his hands over his face…then he keeps motivating the drivers. He’s also managed to communicate with this composure to his drivers in a heated battle to keep their head in the right place.Christian is the only team leader that will speak to the race commentators mid-race. To me, that is a guy that knows what this sport is about! Us fans want to hear perspective from the pitwall as well. Barring a handful of other leaders chiming in occasionally, Christian is consistent.Remember, this is a title fight under extreme pressure, and Christian is talking to the commentators. I value that attention from him! This was the final race of the season and the title decider under a handful of random curve balls thrown at the teams and drivers, and Christian took several opportunities to have a chat and educate.This post is about leadership under extraordinary pressure which is the moment that truly defines a leader. We’ve not seen this level of pressure for a very long time and it’s where true winners are shown.Again, do I agree with what happened Sunday? No, but Red Bull Racing never gave up and kept cool heads when the dynamics changed. They reacted, communicated, made decisions and owned them. As fans we must remember this sport has always had race changing incidents.

That alone should makes the US light-years ahead in military development, right?Well, not quite. Just like any bodily institution on Earth, the US Armed Forces has its own budgeting problem.Usually, it’s a foreign policy problem though.See, the budget for the US military doesn’t just go to tech-development inside the country. It has to go to maintain their global military presence as well. Such case isn’t the case with Russia where they only have small overseas presence in countries such as Central African Republic and Syria.What’s more to add is head-to-head military confrontation between major power is a thing of the past and it will probably be nothing to be concerned of.Let me ask you something. When was the last time you saw Russian Mig-29 having a dogfight with American F-15 in real life? Pretty sure even if you do, it was a mock dogfight in an airshow.Why is that the case? Because a war between Russia and USA is a war that will never come. Thus making an arms race pointless.Like i said, it’s kind of useless to compare Russian and US military because it’s they’re the same on the surface only.The US who seek to be the dominant power on the global stage will always be ahead with its aircraft carrier fleet to which is in line with its gargantuan budget.On the other hand, Russia who has smaller money to spend always prefer to go with nuclear submarine which is while not as impressive, will still makes any foreign forces think twice before having a conflict with Russia.That’s all i can say for now.

Then, naturally, if you want to have a thermobaric munition you’re not going to build a ground vehicle carrier and an unguided missile for it. You’re going to design a bomb or a air-to-surface missile and a surface-to-surface missile for a precise strike.And guess what? The US has exactly that - the BLU and CBU series of bombs and the AGM Hellfire surface-to-Surface missiles. The United States expects its forces to operate in the environment of aerial and naval superiority at a location far from home territory, likely in hostile territory far from friendly bases. Then why deploy a ground vehicle that is relatively slow, vulnerable, difficult to supply and deploy at a remote location in a role that an aircraft can very successfully fulfill?On the other hand the Russian Army generally expects to operate in the environment where the enemy has air superiority or at least the air is contested, there is no naval support available at all and the fighting is going on inside or close to the Russian borders, or in friendly territory where the army can have bases and repair shops (like Syria for example).

Carriers are expensive things that take a lot of hard-learned (and for the USN, hard-won) experience to build and runFor Cold War-era Soviet Russia, that cost was generally deemed too expensive. For current-day China, that cost has been deemed acceptable, and they’re going about the process of getting their own blue-water carrier fleet ready. It’s not going to be anywhere near as good as the USN is, at least not for a long time- which is part of why the Chinese (and the Russians) have long been interested in alternatives- like AShBMs or the Russian Bazalt/Granit/Vulkan families of long-range anti-ship weapons, and the US has not.When you’re the premier,",6 followers,Boris Ivanov,616,10.4K,110.8M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Between-the-United-States-Russia-and-China-who-has-the-best-military-technologies

We also do not know the true capabilities of anything current in terms of technology, as all of this is top secret.So rather than speculating, I’ll give you something which is a fact.This has a very simple explanation, the Russians have conscription and the Americans have a volunteer army. What this means is that Russia has a reserve of 2 million people who have had active service in the last 5 years and received at least 1 years of training plus an additional 350,000 in their national guard + around 20 million reservists who had their military training more than 5 years ago. The US on the other hand have a total reserve of around 800,000, of which more than half is national guard.This means the US would have a hard time replacing large scale losses quickly, while Russia could replace their entire standing army 2 times over. Or increase their standing army size from 1 to 3 million at short notice, which is feasible considering their very large inventory of weapons as well.The US army is already having trouble filling the requirements for their current manpower needs, which has caused them to lower either their requirements for recruit quality, the amount of recruits they’ll take, or both even.No before anyone get their knickers in a twist, please note that this is[Edit]I wrote a while back a short article of some more in-depth arguments for conscription armies over volunteer.

And the US had a lead in 18 areas. They estimated some additional areas which were shaky.Based on the DOD technical documents and other available information, I have made this summary of the state of technology between the two cold war superpowers as best as I can, and with the aim of disproving the common misconception that the Soviets were technologically behind, that many people like to claim by cherry-picking something like computers.NavyThe soviet union produced more thanAirforce:For bombers the USA had the B-52 which is roughly comparable to the Soviet Tu-95. However the US never managed to upgrade it’s bomber fleet during the cold war. While the Soviet Union made more than 800 supersonic bombers the US can to this day only only has made 103 supersonic bombers of the B1 lancer type.Again the Soviet Missile technology was exceptionally good in the late cold war. theThe Soviet Union’s pilots in the 1980s also had the helmet mounted display, which is something US pilots didn’t get on the same level until early 2000s.Army:Infantry Weapons:ArtilleryUS never fielded many MRL systems. The only one ever fielded was theFor basic artillery both sides had the same technology, with the Soviets having a much greater amount of self propelled artillery with the Americans mostly having conventional towed artillery. However, Soviet SP artillery also generally had a higher rate of fire due to their autoloaders.Armour:The US fielded the best computers and electronics, later also the first to use thermal optics. The US ammo was however much slower than Soviet, and the Americans didn’t consider soviet lack of firing computers a problem, due to how fast their projectiles moved.As for the quality of soviet tanks, this is what the US had to say about some of the things i described.","12,757 followers",Khalid Elhassan,2.3K,1.2K,38.2M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Between-the-United-States-Russia-and-China-who-has-the-best-military-technologies
