0,"I have a working proof of concept prototype of a Centrifugal propeller. A video of it is posted on YouTube. I am within a couple of weeks from having a practical purpose prototype that will actually lift into the air. The Centrifugal Propeller will replace all jet engines, rockets, and most air and marine propellers. It will also be used for lifting purposes both commercially and domestically. It has no speed limit in outer space because it will continually accelerate.","1,121 followers",Ann Silberman,971,381,2.8M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-are-emerging-technologies-that-could-reduce-global-catastrophic-biological-risks
1,"No.All these people saying yes, and pointing excitedly to food, vitamins, or lifestyle are forgetting that cancer has been around for millennia. Cancer has been found in Egyptian mummies. Ancient Egyptians certainly ate healthy, they didn’t use plastic, they didn’t have pharmaceuticals companies-and they got cancer and died.Cancer is also found in the bones of dinosaurs. They are a natural diet, they weren’t gulping candy.Cancer is caused by a mutation in a cell. We have millions of cells in our bodies, but all it takes one mutation that isn’t cleared away. What causes that mutation, which isNo.All these people saying yes, and pointing excitedly to food, vitamins, or lifestyle are forgetting that cancer has been around for millennia.

Ancient Egyptians certainly ate healthy, they didn’t use plastic, they didn’t have pharmaceuticals companies-and they got cancer and died.Cancer is also found in the bones of dinosaurs. They are a natural diet, they weren’t gulping candy.Cancer is caused by a mutation in a cell. We have millions of cells in our bodies, but all it takes one mutation that isn’t cleared away. What causes that mutation, which is unique and different in all cancers?Nobody knows. Maybe it was that cigarette you were addicted to, but some people smoke for 70 years and don’t get cancer. Maybe it was a poor diet but most people have poor diets and don’t get disease, and many have great diets who do. It might be that when you were a baby, your mother lifted you out of your crib by a window, just as a bit of radiation from a long dead star passed, and it went through you, causing a mutation that 40 years later would give you cancer.It is folly to believe one can control the uncontrollable or know the unknowable.Someday, maybe there will be a way to prevent cancer but we are a long, long way from that.Of course, there are cancer risks, including a bad diet, too much sun, getting fat. But those things are only risks, not guarantees. At this point in time, there is no way to know what causes cancer and anybody who says different is peddling woo.","1,594 followers",Michael Van In,631,1.5K,2.9M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-are-emerging-technologies-that-could-reduce-global-catastrophic-biological-risks
2,"1. Wind PowerHuge strides have been made over the past 20 years to harvest the power of wind. Progress is bred from necessity, of course, as growing global concerns about global warming and ecological damage caused by pollution call for cleaner, sustainable energy.2. Solar EnergyMuch like wind energy, solar energy has seen an increase in efficiency and a decrease in price in recent years, making solar power a $3-billion industry. New legislation and regulations which make it affordable for businesses and homeowners to convert to solar are responsible for solar energy’s growth over the past 5 y1. Wind PowerHuge strides have been made over the past 20 years to harvest the power of wind. Progress is bred from necessity, of course, as growing global concerns about global warming and ecological damage caused by pollution call for cleaner, sustainable energy.2. Solar EnergyMuch like wind energy, solar energy has seen an increase in efficiency and a decrease in price in recent years, making solar power a $3-billion industry. New legislation and regulations which make it affordable for businesses and homeowners to convert to solar are responsible for solar energy’s growth over the past 5 years, and 2016 will be no different.While only a third of the solar energy available in the US is currently harnessed in the west, this area is geographically superior for solar power generation, and improved government incentives in California indicate this will be the fastest-growing market.3. 3D PrintingThe new millennium has brought us some mind-blowing technology, but none has more potential for impacting the entire world quite like 3D printing.If you’re not familiar with the concept, 3D printers are loaded with additives which can be used like ink to create 3-dimensional objects. That’s4. Legal MarijuanaLegal marijuana sales have grown exponentially since 2012, when Colorado legalized the drug and created the world’s first fully regulated market for recreational marijuana use. In addition to selling the raw plant, it is also being sold as concentrates, edibles, and even beauty products in order to expand the market.Marijuana sales are expected to surpass $20 billion between now and 2020, and that’s if the market stays its course. If other states legalize recreational marijuana use in that time, the industry could experience even greater success.5. Video GamesOver the years, video game developers have been expanding their appeal to reach new markets, including adults and females. This effort has been paid back many times, as the video game industry commands healthy growth year after year. Consumer confidence continues to improve, and there is speculative excitement regarding new virtual reality (VR) technology.While VR will certainly have an effect on the gaming industry, it also has potential in other markets. Whether or not other industries will adopt VR for practical purposes, such as training medical professionals, remains to be seen.6. Artificial IntelligenceFor having come so far, artificial intelligence still has a long way to go. With hopes that AI will one day be able to help solve humanity’s most pressing concerns, billions of dollars fund the research of artificial intelligence every year. Major players include IT companies like Google and Apple, who are already leaders in the field, providing us with such AI amenities as voice-recognition software and self-driving cars.Experts expect the global demand for “smart” machines will increase 20% every year until at least 2020.7. Sustainable Construction MaterialsIn the wake of an international recession, many countries, including the United States, are creating an initiative to boost construction jobs. There are plenty of post-industrial sites around the developed world which need to be rebuilt, and much like the call for sustainable energy sources, governments and consumers alike are calling for greener building materials.Green construction is currently a $36-billion industry, and it is expected to grow an additional 10% by 2020.This industry depends heavily on consumer demand, and may have an even greater outlook with increased government regulations and successful marketing.8. Cyber Fraud DetectionWhere there’s an opportunity to make a quick buck, be sure that there are criminals out there concocting a plan. The trend of doing business and keeping sensitive information on computers will increase, and so will the demand for protection against cyber criminals.Businesses and individuals alike will require protection from cyber fraud for the foreseeable future, but in the next 5 years, this industry is expected to grow over 12% annually.9. DronesDrone technology is new, but the potential for application in a variety of other industries including agriculture, the military, and parcel delivery have already caught the attention of investors. This creates an excellent opportunity in the market to expand research and development of drones, making them more viable with each in iteration. With a projected annual growth of almost 17% annually until 2022, very little is likely to stifle the growth of this industry.10. SiliconRelated to the demand for solar panels, silicon has also been a slowly but steadily growing market in the past decades. In addition to solar panels, silicon is also required to make electronics and building materials, which you may notice are also on this list. For this reason, experts expect to see silicon’s demand increase in the coming years as other industries take hold.These 10 industries show tremendous potential in 2016 and beyond, indicating a future of environmental consciousness and an even greater focus on electronics and AI.",0 followers,Lucas Martin,6.4K,65,4.2M,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-are-emerging-technologies-that-could-reduce-global-catastrophic-biological-risks

It is designed to show very simple basic information in one of your eye. It can show you simple messages like directions or notifications. It works over Bluetooth with either an Android phone or an iPhone much in the same way your smartwatch does, taking commands from an app that runs in the background to control it. If there is any notification it can be read or dismissed using certain head gestures.It has little red monochrome projector. that shines an image on the holographic mirror which bounces it directly into the eyeball.Notification can only be seen if you are look down at the display. It does interfere with the standard line of vision.This was the technology which every college kids dreamt and now Intel has finally built it.﻿Thankyou","36,820 followers",Sindhu Satish,845,1.8K,73.4M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-of-the-biggest-trends-and-emerging-technologies-in-the-water-industry-right-now

By “impossible”, I mean to a scale not imagined by most people. Using nuclear, it would be quite easy to store its wastes if done so in a responsible manner. If using solar, literally (about) 1% of the land would have to be covered with PV in order to power the growing world and its own mass manufacture (and batteries, desal plants, new water piping infrastructure, etc).We have the terrestrial land to sequester the excess CO2.
