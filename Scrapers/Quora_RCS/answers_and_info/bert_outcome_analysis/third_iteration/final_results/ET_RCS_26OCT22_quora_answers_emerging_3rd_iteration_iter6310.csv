Humans weren’t actually being threatened by machines, some smart guy wrote a book predicting that one day machines would grow so smart and sophisticated they would out-compete humans. And the public were so shocked they would form a new Luddite movement to prevent that.So inSupplemental material expanded the Butlerian Jihad into an actual cliché Robot Revolt because the reference to Samuel Butler was missed. And in a way, the whole point of it was to be a lesson in how given the right convincing arguments, entire populations can be driven to do pretty stupid things.The result however is it’s kind of hard to really build something like a modern PC, or anything like Deep Blue if silicon microchips (or any more advanced equivalent) are marked as heretical technology. And the groups that emerged out of the Jihad - Spacers, Bene Gesserit and Mentats - preferred to keep it that way because no pocket computers gave them an important niche to fill.As for “why humans have not evolved further” the simple answer is the Mystery Science Theatre 3000 mantraOn the one hand, there’s the Spacers who mutated into well… this, after smoking huge quantities of spice melange.Don’t do drugs, kids, or you may end up like Squidward here.The Bene Gesserit on the other hand are your more typical fans of eugenics. A dogma in breeding the “right” stock mixed with genetic experimentation and some New Age stuff that turned out to be legit to create psychic super-priests. But it also takes a very-cult like system to actually make them that may or may not involve a body count.Both of them want to be in control, so their super-secret mutative practices were kept exclusive and made rules that trying to replicate them outside these societies was dangerous or even heretical.Tangentially there’s the Mentats. Who unlike the other two aren’t explicitly “evolved.” In fact it’s fairly possible that becoming a Mentat is like becoming a software engineer or a data analyst. Although there’s also a bit of autism spectrum faceting in as well (namely hyperfocus and an atypical perspective) to apparently make them better at being human computers (It was the sixties so autists were still commonly mistaken for child prodigies). None of the source material, for one, says they had huge eyebrows. That was an anomaly of David Lynch’s production and anything it directly inspired.In Lynch’s defence, he did admit to not really reading the book. So I guess he wanted something to visually distinguish them and if they were bald you might have audiences asking if Gurney Halleck was also a Mentat.Herbert only went into physical details of his characters when it was important - like Harkonnen being all red-heads to show their brand of eugenics or Spacers looking like giant manta rays to show how warped they were physically from spice usage - so theoretically humans could be almost any shape.Most importantly though, it’s a space opera that’s been adapted into movies and TV miniseries that’s never really had the budget until now to really vary up the humans. So barring a few exceptions like the Spacer shown in the 1984 movie, the kind of effects or makeup to show how varied humans could get was quite limited.Though personally I’m a fan of the angle",60 followers,Sean Lassiter,10.3K,587,3.2M,2022,https://www.quora.com/The-Dune-universe-is-set-in-the-year-10191-Why-has-technology-seem-so-analog-haven-t-humans-evolved-and-does-everyone-speak-modern-English

Two hundred years is a2. Neoclassicism in the mid-to-early 19th ct., when society, tiring of royal excess, entered the Enlightenment. Values were comity, simplicity, order - and war. The French and American Revolutions were both in this period. The art of the time had corresponding pared down images. Look at “The Death of Marat” by Jacques-Louis David, 17933. In the last part of the 18th and enduring until the early to mid-19th ct, anti-war sentiment, a strong affinity for nature and belief in the individual gained ground. In art, this resulted in Romanticism, which had much more emotionalism in subject and often less4. In the 19th ct., however, romanticism began to dwindle. Industrialization showed its downside. Poverty and slums grew and with them a growing concern for the working class and the “urban wasteland”. In art, this launched a return to realism and a strong academic thrust. Courbet’s 1849 work, “The Stonebreakers” is typical of the period.5. In the mid 19th century, photography was developed, and its use displaced the conventional roles of artists as illustrators and portraitists. A bit later, Paris, the center of the art worldThe last gasp of the 19th century was a society in turmoil - still in reaction to the as-yet-unsolved problems of the Industrial Revolution, confused but excited by new science and wondering about what the next century might bring. Many people yearned to go backwards, others pressed ahead. There were two simultaneous art movements reflecting these positions.6.Art Nouveau recalled the sinuous beauty of yesteryear with an unreality that everyone could yearn for and wish to caress - in its lovely furniture, and the forever youthful women it portrayed. Alphonse Mucha was a master. Here is a poster he did for chocolate from 1889.7.And on the other end of the artistic spectrum, the Post-Impressionists were moving forward, taking impressionism and applying heavier paint, different structures, pushing boundaries.
