That is related to the first point, specially the country that killed thousand civillians Using the atomic Bomb.4: well the thing in history is more than just hate, the thing is a lot of these Kaijuu genre movies are influenced (im not really sure if it started the genre) by Gojira, and a lot of people and directors relate the fame of Gojira, to the fact that was a radiation created monster that appeared to take vengance, remember who used radiation related weapons over japan? US.5 the last reason is the easiest, maybe is just what, the director/screenwriter wants6 it sells on japan floor and some other, well… this is the same of all answers, as a lot of people hate US army, they wont like them to be the winning fact, usually, if the Japanese are more important it will sell on Japan floor, but do not forget that, as i say, US military are usually known because they are the evil invaders that force they culture in any place they can arguing with ‘freedom' and ‘democracy' , thats why so many countries just want to see them lose against a greater force, thats why also, Gojira isn’t the bad guy in japan.",0 followers,Darryl Shannon,893,2.4K,1.9M,2019,https://www.quora.com/If-an-alien-civilisation-was-capable-of-traversing-vast-distances-and-landing-on-Earth-is-it-likely-that-their-advanced-technology-would-also-enable-them-to-remain-completely-hidden-and-undetected

Aliens are specialized creatures who are used to their special environment. They depend upon their high-tech tools to survive. Humans, by comparison, have more imagination, ingenuity and can get by with fewer tools (although this is changing.)Also there is the notion that fatal flaws are present from the beginning. In the movie Forbidden Planet the advanced aliens were wiped out by their own machines which fed upon an ignored part of their brains.In Independence Day the aliens are psychic. They can read each other’s minds. Theirs is probably a society devoid of crime or secrets. Thus they built their computer systems with no regard to security or hacking, why would they need to?

This is a ludicrous size.If Godzilla were just a very large dinosaur-like creature, it wouldn’t be able to walk, let alone breath atomic fire. It would just collapse and be unable to breathe under the weight of its own body. Its bones would snap, no matter how thick they were. Making the legs thicker doesn’t help, because that just increases the mass the legs must support. Paradoxically a giant creature is more fragile than a small one, because the forces acting on the creatures body from its own weight are tremendous. A mouse can fall 3 meters off a roof, and scamper away unharmed. A Brachiosaurus that fell 3 meters would be squashed into pulp by the weight of its own body.So if Godzilla really existed, it would have to have a metabolism and physical structure completely unlike any real life animal that has every existed. Modern military weapons would make short work of any real life giant dinosaur, with ordinary bones, muscles and skin. But Godzilla would be made out of unknown materials, plus he’s got a radioactive fire inside of him. So it’s just unknowable, until we can dissect Godzilla and analyze how his body manages to function. Until then, it’s pretty clear that conventional weapons won’t harm Godzilla.

If it was a pill, they’d be lined up for miles to get it, and if people could make money from it, it would be done tomorrow. But the typical person typically instantly dismisses such solutions without even considering them, much less taking the time to evaluate the extensive research that demonstrates the viability—it is a simple, natural technique for awakening human consciousness:Where most forms of meditation are difficult or impractical to learn, TM is as easy as learning where the light switch is. TM isn’t a religion or philosophy so people of all religions, all nations, and intelligence levels can do it, and nearly 400 peer-reviewed published studies have validated that it works. Furthermore, it is isn’t even necessary for everyone to it to get the results. If only requires that one percent (1%), one out of every hundred people, to do it and that is sufficient to effect the other 99.Philosophies and religions have little power to make changes because they are imposed from the outside. In contrast, what TM is entirely natural. IThe development of coherence in the brains of individuals becomes this in practical expression:TM uses natural procesess to remove the deep-rooted stresses that cause crime, war, sickness, and all forms of suffering in the TM, Like the reverse of shouting “fire!” in a theater, by “cooling” down the tension in the brains of 1%, it creates a field effect of cooling down the other 99. It’s called the Maharishi Effect and there has been numerous studies that demonstrate that it works, most in cities. In those they demonstrate that they can reverse the crime rate, hospitalization rates, and other indicators of misery.This includes one where the crime rate in Washington DC was dropped 27 percent for 2 weeks, and another worldwide study. These charts are just overviews.War was all but stopped in the Middle East and Latin America during the test periods. The best program possible is to have the military do the meditating for the public rather than the way we are using the military now, for outward control. Traditional war is caused by layers of stresses. The military model tries to use military might to quell problems.But war only adds more stress. It the military provided the numbers needed to reduce stresses national wide, worldwide, it would stop stress before it exploded into war.More than reducing negativity, TM awakens consciousness—it awakens our innate intelligences, problem-solving abilities, moral integrity and other aspects of character, mental and physical health, and so forth. This means that the nations can elevate the consciouness of the people so that, not only are stresses erased but the nation rises up to utopian status. The potential for human development has always been there but until Maharishi brought TM to the world, we have never before had a systematic way of awakening it.My guess is that, if you’ve read this far, you’re laughing because it seems so impossible. Yet it works. Nearly 400 studies have demonstrated that it works.This is the best, most thoroughly tested, easiest to implement, most natural program ever devised to develop human potential and naturally rising utopian society. Yet because people laugh, the miss the point, that IT ACTUALLY WORKS.","68,778 followers",Kanthaswamy Balasubramaniam,898,17.3K,413.3M,2021,https://www.quora.com/If-an-alien-civilisation-was-capable-of-traversing-vast-distances-and-landing-on-Earth-is-it-likely-that-their-advanced-technology-would-also-enable-them-to-remain-completely-hidden-and-undetected

I’m not sure how you’d do that, but….yeah, we need 2 kids per mating pair, and no more for a while. And no loopholes about getting a divorce and forming a new mating pair with someone else!The rest is societal. Certain ideas ARE NOT compatible with each other. Unify the languages, into a common mix, or get universal translators for everyone, then divide the land space on the planet by ideology instead. Some places would be totalitarian, others would be anarchist. We would be free as a species to mix and match, and truly figure out the best system of governance. The biggest thing would be to allow individual freedom of movement, while (somehow) disallowing movement of ideological rule. I don’t want one group deciding to bring totalitarian governance to another group that distinctly doesn’t want it. Australia would be a hunting/survivalist paradise outside of the civilized regions. (Seriously, Australia, what did you feed your spiders?!? They’re big enough to shoot with a 30.06!!)ALTERNATIVELY:Put everyone into a virtual environment. Gaming becomes a whole new thing, as players would now be IN the game. Various governmental schemes are played out on servers reserved for them, and all game servers would be an off-shoot from hosting governments, assuming everybody didn’t basically go with some variation of a EULA.Certain servers could even go off-world. You could join a starship server, before it leaves the planet you’re on, and then go to a different world.
