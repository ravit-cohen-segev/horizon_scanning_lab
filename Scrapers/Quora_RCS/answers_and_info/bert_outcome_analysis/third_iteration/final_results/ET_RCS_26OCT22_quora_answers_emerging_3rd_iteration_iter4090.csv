If faster than light communication and travel is possible then the dark forest theory is not feasible.However, I don’t believe that any advanced civilization will ever be able to communicate or travel faster than light. Without faster than light travel and communication, the dark force theory is entirely feasible.Imagine if tomorrow’s newspaper headlines read, “Signal detected from intelligent alien civilization just 20 light years away.” How would you, and your friends, and the world react? People would be terrified, wondering if this other civilization knows we are here, if they are more advanced than us, if they will be hostile or friendly. Do you think our governments would risk trying to contact them? No doubt, some people would want to contact them in the hopes of peace and knowledge. But the majority of us humans would be too scared and unwilling to take the risk. If you agree then that answers the feasibility question right there.If we did try to contact the aliens, it would take 20 years for our message to arrive. Once the aliens know we are here we cannot undo it. It would then take another 20 years for their response to reach us. During those 40 years of uncertainty, a terrified human race would likely prepare for war just in case. Even if the response we got was a message of peace and harmony, would we be able to trust them?When civilizations meet on earth, we can get past the suspicion by communicating face to face. We can exchange diplomats and establish trade. This would not be possible with an alien civilization due to the vast amounts of time between message sent and message received. We will never be able to get past the suspicion. It would be impossible for us to know if they were hostile until it was too late.Without faster than light travel and communication, I think that every civilization will try desperately to stay hidden while searching for other civilizations to destroy.

1,"I’m not an expert in naval gunnery in the world wars. My only claim for special knowledge is that I was a surface warfare officer on a destroyer and part of that qualification involved naval gunnery.

It also probably manifested in better powder for propellant force and more powerful explosives. These advantages are obvious.FiI’m not an expert in naval gunnery in the world wars.

What makes it so bad?First, all the turrets are arranged on the centreline. No superfiring turrets nor wing turrets. Makes sense if you want to engage the enemy on a battleline and have a low profile, makes absolutely no sense otherwise.Moreover, it makes the arrangement of the secondary armament into turrets or gunhouses impossible. The secondary armament is on casemates - and even those are so low that they are neigh useless in any heavier seas. AndBest - QE classThe first true super-dreadnought class and the first RN battleship class where the turrets have been arranged to both ends of the ship (i.e. no central nor wing turrets). The 381 mm guns were the heaviest and most powerful ever so far installed on any battleships, and engineering-wise these ships were excellent. Five of them were built, they all participated in WWI and WWII, and only one of them (HMS Barham) was lost - due to submarine-launched torpedoes.The casemate guns are still there, but the arrangement of the armament, the propulsion and the vitals of the ship allows them easily to be converted into turrets. Moreover, the concentration of the main weapons on superfiring turrets at each end of the ship makes the ship less vulnerable and better to reply on fire if crossed the ‘T’. The QE class was the first to detach off the ‘battle line’ tactics.In the WWII:Worst - Giulio Cesare classYes, the Gangut class wouldWhile sleek and beautiful looking, this class had serious flaws - of which perhaps the bad protection against torpedoes was most fatal. They also were so compact built that renewal and renovation was too costly for them. Caio Duilio was sunk at Taranto 1940.The following Conte de Cavour class was basically a repeat of them. One of them - Leonardo da Vinci, exploded on her own, while Conte de Cavour was damaged beyond economical repairs in Taranto.Best - South Dakota classThe Iowas arrived too late to really participate in the WWII, but the SoDaks were in service almost throughout the war. They possessed excellent armament - both primary and secondary - perhaps the best fire-control equipment of the whole war (the Ford Rangekeeper and radar-controlled gunlaying computer) and excellent armour scheme.The SoDaks conducted on firefights against other battleships and surface combatants, but also worked as floating anti-aircraft batteries, escorts and shore bombardment ships. They performed well on all tasks they were assigned for.",5 followers,Alex Parker,1.6K,485,11M,2019,https://www.quora.com/In-what-ways-did-naval-gunnery-improve-between-the-First-and-Second-World-Wars

This is part of the reason why despite the Battle of Jutland being the wars largest naval engagement, it was inconclusive.In WWII, newer metallurgical techniques allowed for stronger guns that were also combined with radar systems that could both detect enemy locations and point of impacts, analog fire control computers that could adjust the required main guns, and radio communications between ships and aircraft, at least for the US. While not as impactful early in the war, by late ’42 to early ‘43, these techniques were developed enough to have demonstrable effects on the war effort. The Battle of Leyte Gulf in ’44 is also probably the best example of the technical applications of these technologies. A destroyer screening force was able to delay and repulse a battleship group because they could sustain accurate fires on target as well as communicate with other units for further support. Coincidentally, those advanced communications techniques via radi were also of paramount importance to the amphibious campaigns.

Sydney steamed away from the battle ablaze with extensive damage and Kormoran also ablaze. But that was the last anyone saw of Sydney and needless to say, with no comms or other ships nearby, nothing was heard from Sydney at any time during or following the battle. Kormoran’s crew became the only surviving witnesses, making the event one of the most hotly debated and controversial mysteries of the war (i.e. how does a converted merchant ship take out a modern, highly decorated cruiser with no survivors, and can the enemy’s account be trusted???).It was not until 2008 when Sydney’s wreck was found that Kormoran’s crew-testimonies were substantiated and the other unanswered questions resolved. After disengaging, Sydney had limped towards the the Port of Fremantle, in Perth, but she didn’t make it due to her bow detaching from torpedo damage sustained during the battle, causing catastrophic flooding and sinking with the loss of all hands. So, yes - Sydney’s bridge was taken out from the very first shots, and she left the battle otherwise intact, but obviously didn’t survive long enough after disengaging to tell the tale.Plumes of smoke from the battle were seen by residents of the Town of Geraldton, north of Perth, where a substantial memorial now stands. No doubt, those living in the coastal town Carnarvon (which was even closer to the action) also saw the plumes.All photos sourced from[EDIT]: Wow - 44K views and 800 upvotes :-o.

Then going back and crunching the numbers.
