Technologies of this type have performance advantages that are considered “impossible”, using Newtonian science. The “permanent nut fastener” and the “high torque bolt fastener” are the first inventions in this field.The permanent nut fastener solves the inherent weakness of the conventional nut fastener, and is the only nut fastener design “that does not use friction for vibration resistance”. Instead of friction, it uses ""the difference of relative space/time"" in thread timing, and is the only nut fastener design that is “vibration-proof”.The permanent nut design incorporates ""space/time compression"", as a result of ""the twisting of space/time"" (quantum mechanics, non-material science, theory), and is the first example of a new type of science, ""quantum mechanical engineering (non-particle)"". The permanent nut is based on the ""black hole"" (theory), with a twist.The permanent nut fastener is unsurpassed in all performance areas, (torque, proof load, clamp load, max. load with material strength vibration resistance), it appears and installs like a conventional nut. You remove it the same way as a conventional nut, but all of the threads will strip off of the bolt, destroying both the nut and bolt in the process. It won’t come off unless you want it to.Performance so extreme, you can cut a bolted joint in quarters and retain pressure and engagement. It also retains pressure and engagement even if the bolt head is removed and cut in half.The “high torque bolt fastener” features an innovative “shear-proof head”, that solves the inherent weakness of the conventional bolt, while matching the unsurpassed performance, as the permanent nut fastener.These two advanced inventions literally represent “a quantum leap in mechanical engineering technology”.One may need an understanding in engineering or physics, to fully appreciate the awesome potential of this new engineering science.Engineering of this type is a “big step in the right direction”, it will save lives, prevent tragedies from catastrophic failure, and make the world a safer place for everyone.",4 followers,Leon Brennan,24.9K,693,21.5M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-future-of-technological-revolution

The chemicals are no longer in the chemical plants, they are distributed in the environment through all the processed foods and other products. And Plastic! World-changing stuff.

We are a modern society and there is little to convince me that we have any need to become postmodern. In fact, we need a revitalization of our humanities in order to preserve our very modernity which postmodernity threatens. What's at stake is the idea of work and the dignity and opportunity that work provides. If the idea of work is not tied to physical labor, there are dire consequences for the meaning of the human body. This is a humanities question. If you could build the Matrix, should you?The Matrix is the postmodern world, where thought alone is the basis of society. Every other technological 'leap' is merely an incremental adjustment of the modern world we already know. A car goes faster or uses less fuel. A watch keeps time more accurately or uses more precious metals. A tractor harvests corn more efficiently. Water is piped further. None of these are leaps the lead to the creation of a postmodern society.

How does Alexa understand the words you just said?In 1989 I was visiting Carnegie Mellon to decide if I would go to graduate school there.One of the graduate students, Kai-Fu-Lee (now one of the most famous investors in the world and I would check out his excellent recent TED talk on AI) showed me what he was working on:It was speech recognition for the 60 or so commands that might happen on a Navy battleship (ten guesses as to who was funding his project).When you say the word ""Fire!"" a sound wave is created. When you say the word ""hello"" a sound wave that looks different is created.If 100 people say ""Fire"" and 100 people say ""hello"", all of those sounds waves are stored in a database.Now, if a brand new person says ""Hello"" the computer program needs to determine if that person said ""Hello"" or ""fire"".There might be 10 different attributes of every sound wave. It breaks the new person's sound wave into those 10 attributes.Then it compares that ""vector"" of 10 attributes with all of the vectors in its database for ""Hello"" and ""Fire!""It uses a statistical technique called ""Hidden Markov Analysis"" to determine if the sound wave is more like the ""hello""s in the database or more like the ""Fire!"" in the database.Then it says to itself, ""This guy said ""Hello"". ""It then has a line of code that says, ""If someone says ""Hello"" Then say ""Hello"" back"".Additionally, it adds your ""Hello"" to its database.Your ""Hello"" might be slightly different than the other 100 ""Hello""s so it just learned a new way to say ""Hello"". That gives it greater ability in the future to recognize the word ""hello"".In other words, it ""learned"".So it used Statistics to hear you, code to respond to you, and database technology to learn. There's no real intelligence there but it feels like it's intelligence.Multiply that by 30 years and millions of patterns and computers a million times faster and you have Alexa and Siri in today's kitchens.Ask ""Siri"" what gender it is.-----B) EVALUATION FUNCTIONI just mentioned about language recognition. But how does a self-driving car work?Every second it has to make a decision. Does it move forward? Does it brake? Does it swerve to avoid an accident? Does it turn left?How does it get from point A to point B?1) Google Maps. - Using GPS it knows where it is. And it puts itself on Google Maps.2) List all of the possible routes. This is a ""hard"" problem in the mathematical sense (there's no way for it to guess the fastest route. It has to list each route and then sort by the shortest. )But now computers are so fast what would normally be a slow decision (drive me from this corner in Piscataway, New Jersey to the capital building of Sacramento, California) now just takes seconds.3) Waze. Use Waze to eliminate the routes with too much traffic.4) Start driving.5) Statistics: Every microsecond it uses statistics to see if there is blank space or an object that must be avoided or a traffic sign that must be followed.6) Decide what to do according to the code. For each traffic sign, it has code that tells it what to do (if a sign says ""Stop"" it Stops for a second, uses Statistics to see if any traffic is happening on its sides (with radar and cameras to provide the images). )If there is a person standing in front of it, it might just stop.If there's traffic it didn't expect, it might trigger the program to re-route.If it's blank space it will just keep going.If there's a baby crossing the street and it has to swerve to avoid hitting it, but if swerving will cause the car to hit a truck, killing the passenger in the car, then the ""AI"" of the car is dependent on the ethical decisions of the programmer of the car.In other words, in every situation, it determines it's options, then uses an ""evaluation function"" programmed by a coder, to determine which option has the most successful outcome (move the trip forward, don't kill anyone).Eventually the evaluation function will NOT be programmed by a human coder.Instead, through thousands of experiences of other self-driving cars, the experiences plus the outcomes will all be put into a central database.When a new experience is encountered, the code will look up that experience in the database and the database will spit back the best possible outcome.The code will learn statistically what the best outcomes are of each possibly decision and change the code accordingly and send updates to all self-driving cars.-----C) TREESThe hardest game in the world is a board game called GO. With chess, if a computer can evaluate a billion possibilities a second, it can be a world champion level player.But a Go game can involve trillions of possibilities. How did Google make a program, Deep Go, to beat the world's best Go player. This was thought to be impossible.And yet Google did it.For any game, a computer program first builds a tree of possibilities. Much like a human would.A human thinks: ""If I make this move in checkers, my opponent might respond with A, B, or C and then I can do D, E, or F and then my opponent can do G, H, I if I do D or it can do J, K, L if I do E and I'm never going to do F.A computer doesn't select as well as a human so it builds the FULL tree. Meaning, what are ALL of the possible moves it can do, what are ALL of the possible responses of my opponent, etc.And then it uses a programmed evaluation function to look at the leaves of the tree it built.Whichever move results in the best leaf of the tree (as determined by the evaluation function) that is the move it makes.That's how computer chess worked for decades. I'll get to the secret sauce in a second for how computers conquered chess.And then after that I'll describe how computers miraculously conquered Go.It's only a miracle until science can explain it. It's only ""intelligence"" until it can be coded by a programmer.D) HARDWAREEverybody thought for decades (including many Nobel Prize winners) that the best computer chess programs would be developed when scientists encoded the knowledge of the best chess players in the world into the evaluation function.How does the world champion value a position instead of a weak player?This turned out to be wrong.The MORE code in the evaluation function (i.e. the ""smarter"" the evaluation function was from a human perspective) the SLOWER the program.Which meant a smaller tree would be built, which meant less possibilities would be analyzed.What really allowed the programmers at IBM to build ""Deep Blue"" which beat Garry Kasparov in 1997 were two things.Both related to hardware.a. Computers got faster.And finally, they made the evaluation function STUPID in order to use less code so the hardware could value more positions.Then, before anyone caught on to their ""artificial intelligence"" they retired Deep Blue right after it beat the World Champion of chess.As hardware gets faster, artificial intelligence gets ""smarter"".[as an aside, I once gave a date a chip that was the initial chip for “Chip Test” - the “ancestor” of what became the best chess computer, Deep Blue. She was weirded out.]----INTERLUDEWhat I just described is all the basics. You can stop now.The rest of artificial intelligence is simply combining the basics to make more advanced techniques.-----E) STATISTICS + TREERemember the TREE from computer gaming. And STATISTICS from speech recognition.Now let's go to the impossible game of Go. Google developed the program ""AlphaGo"" to win at Go when everyone else thought it would take another 20 to 50 years.First, remember Kai-Fu Lee who worked on speech recognition. And later developed Apple's first attempts at speech recognition in the 90s?At one point in his grad student days, he was getting tired of navy battleship commands (as one does) and decided to focus on building a program to play Othello.He ended up building the world champion of Othello.He took a lot of games, let's say a million, and put them in a database. And each position from each game, he would label, ""winning"" (if it was a position on the winning side) or ""losing"" in a massive database.He would identify several attributes of each position (how many white pieces, versus black pieces, how many corners were controlled, how many pieces were on the sides, etc).Now, if the computer was playing a brand new game, it would determine all the attributes of that position, then use Hidden Markov Analysis (remember: speech recognition) to match that position to the database.If the position pattern-matched a ""winning position"" then it would make the move that would lead to that winning position. If it matched a ""losing position"" it would not make that move.That program became the world champion of Othello.AlphaGo took it one step further.It put in the positions of millions of Go positions and did the same sort of breakdown.It used faster hardware to speed up the process.Then, once it became pretty good at GO, it played BILLIONS of games against ITSELF to put many BILLIONS of new positions into the database. In other words, it ""learned"".Now it was ready to play Go. It crushed the world champion------That's basically it. That's all of artificial intelligence.Let's say a bank wanted to fire all of the employees in charge of lending. And replace them by artificial intelligence.How would the bank lend money?Well, there's 100s of millions of loans already out there. And for each person who has ever borrowed money I know:- their ageI can put all these vectors in a database and divide them into people ""most likely to pay back the loan"" and people ""most likely to default"".Then, just like speech recognition or the Othello program above, I can use statistics to determine who I should loan money to.And if I say ""no"", I don't have to explain. On to the next one!---Let's say I want to fight terrorists.I already have examples of many terrorists who trained in the US and then went on to perform or attempt acts of terror.I know everything about their bank accounts. How often they transferred money. How often they traveled. How often they took out cash versus using a debit card.And so on.I can build a vector of attributes of what a terrorist bank account looks like. Then I can match new people against that database of vectors of terrorists.Believe me, every time you do a bank transfer, some AI program is out there trying to determine if you are a terrorist.----This is all that AI is.It is nothing more. It's not ""intelligent"" from a human sense. It's not conscious, nor will it ever be.Here's how AI has improved in the past forty years (and how it will improve the next 40):- statistics has gotten betterWhat is changing the fastest is data. The land grab of modern society is not land, or gold, or oil.It's data.I have been invested in many companies that collect and sell data. I was an early investor (and on the board of)Believe me when I say, data-driven companies know how many strawberries you ate last summer.And right now that data is used mostly to target you for ads about sneakers. Or politics.But this is AI 1.0. Soon that data will be used to target your every movement, your every want, your every need.Amazon Prime won't be about delivering you what you want tomorrow. Amazon Prime Plus will be about delivering you what you want yesterday.Police 2.0 will be like the movie ""Minority Report"".Even art and music will be driven by AI that studies the neurochemical responses to music you like to music you don't like. And then compose accordingly.Where will humans still be unique?I don't know. Ask the humans with AI implants that enhance their brains so when they look at you they know exactly what answers will make you happy.BUT… will AI replace jobs?The answer (at least in the next decade or so…) is NO.Look at recent examples:A) Many people were worried ATM machines would replace bank tellers.Instead, the banks made so much in profits they opened up more branches than ever, creating new jobs.B) Will autonomous delivery services cost jobs.Right now there are millions of truck drivers involved in delivering goods. With autonomous delivery, less people will go shopping, more people will be required to shop in the aisles, finding products for people.Obviously this is not a high-end job. But this replaces the fact that less cashiers and drivers will be needed.Meanwhile, there will be more high-end jobs. More maintenance engineers for the cars, customer service, marketing, etc.C) Ecommerce. Branding will become less important (branding is VERY important when everyone is shopping at the big box store but advertising will have to become more clever and digital) so the millions in profits that are generated from AI will filter down to more people starting e-commerce ventures and the ancillary businesses associated with that.)Final conclusion:This is probably a net NEGATIVE for society as the higher classes will be able to afford “super AI” capabilities, making them demi-gods to lower-classes.Instead, massive profits will be generated, which will be soaked into the economy through a rising stock market, increase in opportunities, etc.",1 follower,Kirk Scott,2K,13.4K,68.1M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-single-piece-of-technology-makes-your-life-easier

The legal system and prison enterprise would also change along with the world of politics.Space exploration and building new civilizations would become a priority. Moreover, education would be geared more towards innovation, exploration and the individuals own strengths/interests.There would be a bartering system once again. Not a system that replaced money altogether, but more of a second option for people to help eachother out through personal negotiations/services.I figure all of this is a decent start to get the wheels in motion. Naturally there would be drawbacks and the unexpected. Human nature is greedy and isn't always predictable. I'm glad I'm not in charge of the fate of humanity.

If most people move to use self driving cars as a service retail, driving jobs could rapidly evaporate, urban planning could need to be restructured as parking spaces and the number of sitting vehicles go away (estimates are that <20% of the current vehicle stock would be needed if self driving cars offered a transportation service).","135,508 followers",Hector Quintanilla,950,1.2K,88.5M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-future-of-technological-revolution
