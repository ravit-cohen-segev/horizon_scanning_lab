A ‘rifleman’ was not so much a man with a rifle, but a rifle with a man: The man served the weapon, like the man served the machine in tailorism.The American Army mainly understood its combat units as an assortment of specialists, ultimativly exchangable against similar specialists, industrially producing and directing firepower.The positive side was an excellent logistic system and great availability of firepower down to small units.The drawback was that people were seen as interchangable and expendable and treated that way: If you were wounded you might return to your unit, or not. Replacements might come from anywhere up to the point of you having a hard time understanding what your fox hole buddies says or you are asked to bunk with somebody your people consider an ancestral enemy or rival.That was also what led to the whole ‘FNG’-problem that also reared its head again in Korea and Vietnam:Veterans did not have the emotional fortitude left to get to know the new guy who would most likely, in no small part because he was not integrated into the unit, become a casualty soon.",45 followers,Bradley Ross,3.3K,411,640.1K,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-was-the-difference-between-American-and-German-soldiers-during-World-War-2

Training, production, logistics, operations and organizations reflected a business-like approach. Unlike the German army, the US army did not use geographically organized units. Because the men were only posted after basic training, the divisions spent 12 to 18 months training afterwards to compensate for lack of permanent small units at the start.The other major difference would be the logistics the soldiers operated under. The German army essentially operated on a logistical shoestring compared to the US army. Even when there were short coming with the US or Allied effort, it still outweighed what the Germans operated at.It is staggering to imagine what the German army at the start of the war could have accomplished if they had been equipped with number of trucks the US army used in 1944/45.",0 followers,Jay Snead,3.7K,8.1K,34.4M,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-was-the-difference-between-American-and-German-soldiers-during-World-War-2

I remember most about his letters was that they spent much time hauling gasoline (and ammo) to the front from rear areas. This leads me to think about logistics, if that’s the term, the supply of forward deployed formations and how we had the wherewithall to 1) have the supplies delivered to the continent, and 2) the means to bring them to the front with “surplus” artillery troops. I’m not sure the Germans could do that, then.While he says the German planes “pestered” him at times with straffing, I’d say the German air force was at no time impeding their travel, implacement, or registering of their big guns.Any difference between the soldiers is not addressed. Obviously, he had respect for them. Also obviously, he didn’t encounter them head-to-head. He had a more “theater” view of things and was neither impressed nor unimpressed. The way he’d put it was, he was too busy to think about these things.In retrospect, I think he’d say they were fine soldiers but perfectly beatable. LIke any other.

This is the closest I could find in a U.S. WW II Intelligence Bulletin (1944). These are a few comments made by German POWs during their interviews to the American Military Intelligence Officers.“Allied infantry attack very cautiously and bunch up too much when they move against their objectives,"" the Panzer Grenadier said. ""They are very negligent about seeking concealment, and therefore can be seen most of the time. When they move against their objectives, their lines are not staggered enough and are deep instead of wide.”""Allied soldiers on the double, upon coming to a sudden halt frequently remain in a kneeling position, simply waiting to be shot at, instead of throwing themselves to the ground. Then, if nothing happens, they get up on the same spot where they were kneeling before, and continue their advance. I think this is extremely dangerous, especially when the terrain is dotted with snipers, as it is in Italy. I myself have seen at least a dozen Allied soldiers die because of this stupidity.”“Sometimes, however, the Allied infantryman will drop after a shot has been fired and will roll to the right. We Germans know this. We have also noticed that Allied infantry run toward their objectives in a straight line, forgetting to zigzag and thus making an excellent target.”“The net cover on the helmets of Allied soldiers permits us to see the outline of the helmet distinctly, and at a considerable distance, in the daytime,"" the German soldier concluded. ""On the other hand, the camouflage that we [Germans] use on our helmets disrupts the outline of the helmet, and the canvas cover can be painted to suit the terrain.”More information here.A whole list of articles.

Germany was always low on supplies and had to be economical in their use.Similar to the Japanese Navy, the German Army believed in meticulously planned strikes that would gain ground before the enemy could recover. This worked well in the Blitzrieg attack though France and Belgium, but failed miserably in the Battle of the Bulge. They were also very well trained in fighting retreats, which required a great deal of training and planning to avoid leaving points exposed.The Americans used their incredible logistical ability to move huge amounts of material to the front lines. They also believed in using their material far more generously, using large amounts of artillery even if they weren’t sure of the enemy positions. This was the origin of reconnaissance by fire.The British and American forces also believed in maintaining a steady advance of the front line instead of using attacks at strategic points to break through the line. They felt that units engaged in such a breakthrough would be quickly surrounded and destroyed by the enemy. That is what happened to the Germans at the battle of the Bulge. The Allied lines barely moved and the German forces were obliterated. That is also why the Allies didn’t bypass the Hurtgen Forest. If they had bypassed it, the Germans would have surrounded the Allied forces and destroyed them. (That’s where the German equipment for the Battle of the Bulge was collecting.) The Germans were trained for launching raids and countering the enemy’s raids.One possible comparison would have been to compare the German attacks to the tactics of Robert E. Lee in the American Civil War and the Allied tactics to those of Grant and Sherman. In fact, the Battle of Gettysburg had many similarities to the Battle of the Bulge.The American advances seemed sloppy and uncoordinated to the Germans, but the Americans felt that trying to coordinate everything completely would have delayed the advance and given the Germans an opportunity to counter-attack. Instead of planning the movement of the front-line troops, the Allies spent their time planning and improving the logistical supply of the troops, planning the movement of the troops around the movement of the supplies. The Allied plans seemed unpredictable to the Germans because they weren’t using the same strategies.",0 followers,Cameron Greene,1.7K,581,11.7M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-was-the-difference-between-American-and-German-soldiers-during-World-War-2

US Army doctrine for units at every level was what they called the holding attack. It was designed to take advantage of the American superiority in logistics, artillery, and close air support to reduce casualties and it was very successful.The factor of three was applied at all levels. Three squads made up a platoon. Three platoons were a rifle company. Three rifle companies made up an infantry battalion. Three infantry battalions were an infantry regiment. The division had three infantry regiments.When a division encountered the enemy, one of its three regiments would engage the enemy to hold them in position. Then airpower and time-on-target artillery barrages would hammer the enemy while the other regiments would make a single or double envelopment maneuver to force the enemy out of its position. Then they would repeat as long as needed.Germans were tenacious in defense throughout the war, in Italy, in Russia, everywhere. They almost never collapsed and retreated, they had to be forced out of every position until they ran out of combat power to continue. The holding attack did not allow the Germans to create huge casualties like they did against Russian direct assaults. US artillery and airpower were demoralizing and crippled their ability to hold ground like they were accustomed to.When placed on defense, the Americans rarely retreated and collapsed like the 1940 French army. When the front lines were overrun in the Battle of the Bulge, the Americans withdrew to small and defendable pockets of resistance in St. Vith, Bastogne, and held Elsenborn Ridge until the front stabilized and relief could arrive.And they knew that relief would arrive. There were always new divisions going into the line. The air corps was only waiting for good weather and the artillery was pounding the enemy with indirect fire. The Americans knew how to utilize their advantages. So did the Germans, of course, but the advantages they had enjoyed during Blitzkreig were beyond their capacity to match in 1945.",6 followers,Boris Ivanov,2.8K,10.4K,110.8M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-was-the-difference-between-American-and-German-soldiers-during-World-War-2

Napoleon’s orders automated this process and caused it to happen quickly.The French group making first contact decisively engaged. (Decisively engage means to not allow him to retreat and disengage or get away.) Then they fired their cannons as the sound would carry many miles. All other groups hearing this ran to the battle area, even leaving their cannons to catch up later. This allowed them to gain numerical superiority first and quickly defeat the enemy group. By the time the enemy reinforcements arrived, the French had dispersed and all they found were the bodies of the group just defeated. Napoleon’s Army groups would repeat this all day long defeating their enemy piecemeal.Edit: I must admit my surprise that there is so much interest in this topic and answer. Given the level of interest, it deserves the addition of three things. One is for me to provide an authoritative reference and source for the answer. Second is to correct the impression by some that this was one of Napoleon’s grand strategies. Instead, it was a simple, lower-level tactic. Third, I will add a richer level of detail that some might enjoy.First, the source is “The Wars of Napoleon”, Albert Sidney Britt III, Thomas E. Griess, series editor. It is part of the “West Point Military History Series”. It is produced by the Department of History, United States Military Academy. The quotes are from page 33 and 34 under the headings of “Tactics” and “The Corps System”. My quotes and page numbers are from the first edition. A second edition is available on Amazon.Here are some direct quotes from the book:“The typical battle of the eighteenth century was a formal, set-piece affair. Napoleon, however, thought of battle as a sort of meeting engagement. The side that reacted quickest and with the firmest grasp of the situation could achieve a decisive victory. .................Napoleon rarely expected decisive battle to occur at a predetermined time and place.”“The corps marched dispersed, a condition dictated by the requirement for foraging. .........During the march to contact, all corps remained within supporting distance. .........Napoleon concentrated the army when contact was made with strong enemy forces.”“The key to the corps system thus lay in the capability it gave the Grande Armee to march dispersed and to concentrate for fighting. In place of detailed regulations for maneuver and deployment prescribed by most European armies, the French corps operated by what might be called standing operating procedure (SOP).”“Once a corps engaged an enemy force, control of the battle passed largely to the corps commander. The corps ... was expected to aggressively fix the the enemy to develop the situation. Meanwhile, the nearest corps was under strict standing orders to “march to the sound of the guns”, not to wait for detailed instructions. .......This policy reduced reaction time and contributed to the offensive spirit that distinguished the French Army from its more lethargic adversaries.”A note from me (not from the book): A key principle for victory that applies to armies of all centuries is to concentrate superior forces at any given place and time. The reason it works can be simplistically explained this way: If you start a gunfight with an adversary 100 yards away and you have equal weapons, equal accuracy, and equal rates of fire, after a certain number of trigger pulls one of you will be dead. Now assume four more adversaries join the first. Their rate of fire is now five times yours. Statistically speaking, you will die five times quicker than your average adversary. Scale this up with hundreds or thousands of troops and you can see that the one with least soldiers runs out of people the quickest. If five battalions fight one battalion, when the smoke clears the winner still has at least four and the others are all dead.Another way to explain what happens when you are outnumbered is that the enemy turns your flanks, meaning their longer battle line wraps around yours. Now you are receiving fire from the front and both sides. If they wrap all the way around your lines, then you also take fire from the rear. In these kinds of situations, the losing force breaks down quickly and either surrenders or dies.",34 followers,James Russell,4.4K,1.6K,7.2M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-was-the-difference-between-American-and-German-soldiers-during-World-War-2

20,The Constitution can be changed with time via amendments. Having a Constitution which ensures the rights of citizens would not be very useful if it simply changed arbitrarily with time. Whose changes would be made- Biden’s or Trump’s? It would not work.But having the process of amending the Constitution allows a majority of citizens to make changes which the majority desire. It is necessarily time-consuming and difficult since frequent changes on the whim of the majority is not really all that safe for minorities.,"37,920 followers",Ron Rule,535,2.7K,51.6M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-was-the-difference-between-American-and-German-soldiers-during-World-War-2

You are in fact arguing the opposite. You are arguing that it should be frozen in time so that the only things that are protected are those that were protected when it was ratified.Since you think the 2nd Amendment is flawed because no one could have anticipated modern weapons, let’s see what already existed when the 2nd Amendment was ratified.Finally, the Founding Fathers weren’t stupid. They knew technology would continue to advance as it already had been. If they wanted to restrict the 2nd Amendment to muskets, they could have used the word “muskets” but instead they deliberately chose the far more encompassing term “arms”.But if this is really the argument that you want to make, fine.

Artillery were weapons that could not be carried, or required more than one person to operate, or exploded on impact. Things such as cannons, rockets, bombs, etc. Those weren't explicitly protected as Arms were.But the early framers of the constitution most certainly knew and expected that guns would improve, become more accurate, hold more rounds, fire faster, and so on.
