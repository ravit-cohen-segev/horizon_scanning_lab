A manned trip to Mars, or any place else for that matter, is a completely different animal.If you think sending a man, or a probe to another star is possible, the nearest, Alpha Centauri Proxima, is 70,000 years away at our current possible speed.However, since the ending of the Apollo program, NASA, Russia, the European Space Agency, China, India, and other countries have launched exploration programs of different sorts. There's probes, detectors, space telescopes, and rovers. India wants to launch more manned missions, while China is planning on sending unmanned probes to Mars.Here's some of what we've discovered...The SunMercuryVenusMarsAsteroid Ida and it's moon DactylJupiterThe Galilean moon IoSaturn (eclipsing the Sun)The Saturnian moon TitanUranusNeptunePlutoPluto's largest moon CharonThere's also Voyager 1 and 2, Cassini and Huygens, and the New Horizons probe which will flyby Pluto in July 2015.At least 3 Martian rovers I know about, 2 probes that take stereoscopic readings of the Sun, and even a gravity wave detector.The Aracibo radio telescope, the Keck twin telescopes in Hawaii, and the Allen telescope array in California.The Hubble Space Telescope has brought the farthest reaches of the Universe up close...The Hubble Deep Field (all dots of light are galaxies)The Pillars Of Creation in the Eagle Nebula (all those little spikes are new stars)An actual photo of a black hole at the center of galaxy M87.The next generation of space telescope, the James Webb Space Telescope, is scheduled to be launched in 2018.Model of the James Webb Space TelescopeWe've even seen the beginnings of the UniverseWMAP image of the Cosmic Microwave Background.How about closer to home?International Space StationSuper massive black holes have been detected in nearly every galactic core looked at.There's also a growing body of observed exoplanets, some found by amateur astronomers with backyard telescopes.Image of exoplanet Beta PictorisAnd all this is only a fraction of what we've discovered.

Secondarily, however, the technology is simply not good enough.

5,"There has been a significant amount of exploration done, but I suspect that you are talking about manned exploration. In 1970, some expected to be visiting Mars by 1985, but after public interest declined, funding was cut, which eliminated many new missions and limited currently planned ones. Then the Challenger disaster in 1986 brought manned missions to a virtual stop for a while. The cost of maintaining the space shuttles continued to grow and Congress wasn't willing to fund a replacement, so when they were eventually retired, we no longer had a facility for putting people into space.

Several companies are working on vehicles for manned launches, but only Russia has one now that can provide transportation to the ISS and no country has one ready to send people beyond the Earth. It is mostly a question of money. It's a very expensive business and most politicians are more interested in domestic issues and fighting wars than sending people to explore space. Unless there is some significant change, it's unlikely that we'll see manned travel beyond the Earth in the next decade. ...

Most notable was Scheme. (We also used SML, but I wasn't mature enough to see the merits of static typing when done properly.) After the first couple of small Scheme assignments there was a moment of ""Fuck, why can't we use languages like this for 'real' programming?""It was a few years later that I learned that you actually can.",628 followers,Dipt Chaudhary,9.5K,0,0,2012,https://www.quora.com/Why-hasnt-space-exploration-really-taken-off-after-the-moon-landings-What-are-we-waiting-for-Why-hasnt-the-price-for-space-explorations-gone-down-yet-so-that-common-people-can-become-a-part-of-it
20,"I've had many ""ah ha"" moments.My biggest however was probably my Computer Organization course, where we built a computer up all the way from an abstract state machine through flip/flops, gates, micro-code, machine code and operating system.That was when the box stopped being a magic thing I fed incantations into and I started to really understand what it was and what it did inside.",245 followers,Rajat Kumar,2.9K,71,1.8M,2012,https://www.quora.com/Why-hasnt-space-exploration-really-taken-off-after-the-moon-landings-What-are-we-waiting-for-Why-hasnt-the-price-for-space-explorations-gone-down-yet-so-that-common-people-can-become-a-part-of-it
21,My moment came in college when I was a sophomore. I was in my third level of Java and had always just gotten by - pretty much just banging around until I got something working that got me by. It was a data structures class and I was working on a red-black tree. After a couple of hours sitting there working on it I had this realization (an Aha moment if you will) that I can't really explain. Everything just clicked and I felt like I could program anything I wanted.

22,"I started coding from very early age, even before I knew English. I was copying code into a Vic 20 without really understanding what PRINT is. I just knew what it did. Later I learned Basic from books, and after that took a course in C where I was the youngest kid.

These are very high-level languages that won't give you as much control over your code as needed.Step 2Get on Hackerrank because it has the best User Interface, combined with relative ease of getting started for the beginners.Ease in the sense that anyone with zero CP/algorithms experience will be able to solve the beginner Questions because it’s for everyone.You might get stuck after first 4-5 questions and that's normal. In that case, feel free to see the editorial or google to look for the solution.When you find it, make sure to understand it, and then code it on your own.First, solve ""Easy"" questions of all sections, and then ""Medium"" questions.In fact, solving some ""Medium"" questions is good enough to call yourself a CP professional.And when you make sure that you’re able to solve Medium questions , then start CP on CodeChef that is a much professional practical area to code.Step 3Codechef long contests are the best. Developing your Competitive Programming skills requires that you are both fast and are able to think deeply about a problem.Codechef long challenges = Deep thinking AND Codeforces rounds = Fast codingIf you want to be good, you should try to be good in both these areas.But it's fine if you are just good at long challenges (deep thinking) or just good with short contests (fast thinking), both will help you become a better programmer.Step 4You can try Topcoder if you want. Or just let it be.With CP, if your goal is to get offers from Google HQ and likes, you will have to do it regularly. That is, give contests, try to rank higher, and build your rating.Otherwise, you can just do it on the side and focus on building other practical skills.These practical skills combined with your decent competitive programming experience will go a long way in helping you secure those jobs and internships you dreamed about.Step 5Keep doing this it will take Some time but it is the best way to be a Competitive Programmer.Don’t Be Frustrated.I need Your upvote ,Hit up if you’re also think Programming is Best <3images - Google images","44,325 followers",Kurt Guntheroth,685,13.7K,167.4M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Why-hasnt-space-exploration-really-taken-off-after-the-moon-landings-What-are-we-waiting-for-Why-hasnt-the-price-for-space-explorations-gone-down-yet-so-that-common-people-can-become-a-part-of-it
