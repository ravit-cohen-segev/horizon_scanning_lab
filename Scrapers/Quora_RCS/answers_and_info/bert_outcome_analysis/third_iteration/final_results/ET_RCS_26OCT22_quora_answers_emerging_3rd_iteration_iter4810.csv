This serves two purposes:The nature of orky technology is one of these unreliable-narrator “facts” that has been headcanoned one too many times. It began, as I recall, with a statement in one of the ork codexes that Imperial observers were frequently stymied by recovered orky technology that seemed like it had no way to work - and yet, had been observed working on the very battlefield from which it was recovered. One possible solution to this mystery, these Imperial observers posited, is that orky technology works because the orks are a highly psychic race (not individually, but collectively). In other words, they proposed, perhaps the orks’ tech works because the orksThis is an attractive and amusing theory, but I am aware of no definitive statements in 40K publications that it isThe gestalt field theory also has the problem thatThere are problems with all explanations of orky technology, of course. That’s the point. 40K thrives on uncertainty in its lore, as previously discussed.So … what would happen if an ork put on a glove and believed with all his green heart that he could now kill with a touch?Nobody knows.

If enough Orks can belive by painting something red, it drive faster, it WILL go faster. The extra speed is reliant on the Orks belief.The best part about having this killer glove? No-other race can use it. Remember, if the glove is taken away from orks, there won’t be a WAAAGH! field to sustain it. \An inquisitor could just pick up the glove and kill people with it, unless he gets lucky enough to immediately kill his first few opponents so that the Orks believe the glove works for him, it won’t work for him.Remeber, ork weapons dont work in the hands of non-orks (except for Yarrik as he’s a badass(i mean seriously, he has an ork Klaw and a bionic lazer eye.

I held the mark of no psyker, but the weight of its wards were felt even in my mind.The chained Eldar sneered at me. “I merely decided how, mon’keigh. His fate was death: across a thousand strands of fate, across the web of time and future. Every decision, every act, every roll of the dice: death. Unavoidable. Not even your savagery can change fate.”It took every shred of will to not reach out and squash her head in an armored grip, to reduce it to a mess of flesh and crunched bone and black hair. Arrogance burned in the farseer’s eyes, arrogance and hate, and a smug satisfaction.“And it is thatA grin formed at her lips. “It’s the death of a beast either way. One of no value, no culture, no civilization worth speaking of. One who was destined to die in any case. I hold no regrets.”An idea sprung up in my mind then: a malevolent intent. “I am a bit of a fortune teller myself, Eldar. A hobby of mine. But I’m surprisingly accurate. For example, I foresee torment for you, Eldar. Infinite, unending torment.”Those almond-shaped, green eyes shone in mockery. “I know of you, mon’keigh. Of your psykers, drugs, engines of torture. I have witnessed worse, seen worse, committed worse. There is no agony, no pain, you can inflict upon me that I fear.”“That I can inflict?” I feigned surprise. “You thoroughly misunderstand, farseer. I do not intend to stain my hands bothering to inflict misery upon you. There are those far more capable than I in that regard.”For a moment, I saw surprise in those eyes. Hidden a second later, but still surprise. She had steeled herself for torture. Expected to face drugs and blades and engines of Inquisitorial torture.I reached out, armored fingers closing around a piece of jewelry just below her neck. They came back holding scraps of metal and wraith-bone, and amidst it all a single, blue stone, shining dimly in the low light.For the first time, the farseer’s eyes grew wide in abject dread, dread given only by understanding. “No. You won’t. You can’t.”I inclined my head. “You did not foresee this, did you, farseer? You did not look far enough.” I rolled the stone in between my fingers.“Every Eldar soul strengthens She Who Thirsts. You’d feed your worst enemy. For what? Spite? Hatred? For those would you empower The Great Enemy?”I did not reply that moment. My hand gave the reply, my closing fingers. The cracks that appeared across the polished blue surface, spreading, and then the Spirit Stone falling to dust in a thousand pieces. Terror took the Farseer: she grew pale, her eyes opened wide. “You are so disdainful of human civilization, Farseer. Far be it from me to stop you from enjoying the fruits of yours.”I stood up, turned back, the Eldar speaking behind me still, but I paid no attention to her words. I paused for only a second before leaving the room, turning to Vanator inside with me, bolt pistol in hand. He used to be a Carcharodon Astra, and every bit as vicious as that implied: best pistol-shot and swordsman in the entire company.“Kill her.” And then I left, door still open behind me.“NO-”The report of a single shot cut off the voice, and then everything went into silence.For my other short stories, you can visit","115,124 followers",Daveed Phoenix,8.1K,9.9K,160.6M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-would-happen-if-an-Ork-put-on-some-random-glove-and-believed-that-he-could-instantly-kill-someone-by-touching-them

Jobs was a hugeWhat makesSteve Jobs persona was driven by a unique strength of will and the narrative of his professional achievements is arguably as relevant as that of Bob Dylan or the Beatles. (Dylan and Beatle fans, please put your guns down and let me explain.) Jobs was a huge fan of Dylan and let's consider the comparison.The legend, the fairytale, the rags to riches story that we have consumed is an aggregate of facts, fictions and some measure of exaggeration. The authorised biography by Walter Issacson is probably about as close as to accurate in terms of interviews, research, etc, that anyone is going to get, but the point is that the story itself is quite fascinating. As for Dylan, here's another celebrity persona, steeped in enigma and protective privacy that changed the course of music across folk and rock and roll forever. He left Minnesota, determined and brash, famously self-confident and driven to success. And the less we know about the individual, the more we want to know and the more we seek to idolise. (Thank you, Robert De Niro, for your secret life and changing the course of method acting for your generation and being another movie idol).A quirky, argumentative, spiritual seeker with a powerful and intense personality travels to India for insights, takes drugs, returns to start a company in a garage, becomes a millionaire. He gathers a team to create a new user interface which sets the tone for all personal computers for the next century (probably). Gets fired in an evil play for internal control. Is begged to return just as the company is about to bust and turns it all around to extraordinary heights of success. He delivers a crazy cool music device that nobody's ever seen, starts another absurdly successful company, then other outstanding devices and dies young, a billionaire. All the elements for rock star status are written into this narrative. And who wouldn't want to put Steve Jobs into the CD player and listen to that narrative? Probably those whose musical tastes for this storyline are not impressed. But the disdain for Jobs is mostly rooted in the Microsoft versus Apple rivalry and it's a petty and juvenile argument by 2014.Was he as amazing as Dylan, Elvis, Picasso, Henry Ford? Sure. why not?
