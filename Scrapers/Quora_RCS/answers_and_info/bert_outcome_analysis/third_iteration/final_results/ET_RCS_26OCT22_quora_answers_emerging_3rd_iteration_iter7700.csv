However, little research has been published on the application of Thorium molten salt reactor technology to space fission systems.Molten salt reactor technology deserves to be carefully considered for Nuclear Electric Propulsion (NEP) and particularly for space colony surface power at the 100 kWe to 15 MWe level. Central to the TMSR design is a liquid mixture of LiF, BeF, and highly enriched fissile U233 or U235 fuel that acts as both fuel and core coolant.Thorium Molten Salt Reactors, when built, promise to be exceptionally safe fission power plants with good power to weight (power density). These qualities tend to suggest TMSRs for some space applications. TMSRs in space could be particularly well suited to operation as colony reactors on the Moon and on Mars, providing reliable power to keep early settlements going.Reliability and safety are paramount concerns for early colony reactors which will depend for their very existence on reliable power to maintain living conditions in the colony. The four year operational experience that Oak Ridge National Lab had with the MSRE Molten Salt Reactor prototype suggests that a TMSR reactor would be both safe and reliable.Zero gravity operation of TMSRs does bring some unknown complications and would require additional study and experimental testing to assure safety. Some of the engineered safety systems routinely included in TMSRs, like the gravity driven safety salt storage tank used under accident conditions to shut off fission and safely store salt and fuel for reactor restart may not work at zero gravity.Substantial Thorium fuel deposits are known to exist on both the Moon and on Mars.Survey by the mars odyssey spacecraft for Thorium deposits on MarsFusion actually has many advantages, long term, over fission power plants of any type in space applications. It should be recognized, however, that current fusion technology is less mature than fission technology. We have far less operational experience with fusion power plants than fission power plants both on earth and in space. In the longer term, there are reasons to believe that fusion power will be extensively deployed both on earth and in space.Specific types of Fusion can have significant advantages when used in space propulsion, bettering the performance of both chemical or fission based thermal nuclear propulsion rockets -Since the 1960s, fusion research has focused on the D-T reaction, as it appears to be the least challenging from the perspective of plasma confinement and reactor technology for utility grid power generation. Steady progress toward the objective of terrestrial net fusion power generation continues to be made, with most development funding devoted to the magnetic plasma confinement approach (MCF).The primary fusion R&D effort currently underway is a very large magnetic confinement device called ITER, which is projected to lead to net power generation (~2030) and a follow on DEMO fusion tokamak is expected to produce at 10 Gigawatt (GW) of commercial electrical power in the 2050 time frame. A power system with this specific mass too heavy for a spacecraft application. Enabling a “step function” decrease in initial mass in Low Earth Orbit (IMLEO) and mission duration for the human exploration of Mars requires an in-space power-propulsion system with specific mass well under 3 kg/kWe. This cannot be accomplished within the limitations of the heat engine conversion required by current MCF tokamak D-T fusion reactors such as ITER.There are almost certainly, however, more suitable forms of fusion being developed for space. Fusion that produces energy in short controlled bursts is likely to be lower mass and higher power to weight than Magnetic Confinement DT fueled tokamaks. Such pulsed fusion energy reactors are called Inertial Confinement Fusion orThere is literally 10^10 times more fusion fuel in space than all forms of fission nuclear fuel combined (Thorium, Natural Uranium, and Plutonium) in the Universe.(There is 10^10 times more hydrogen and 10^6 times more deuterium than all fission nuclear fuels taken together in the universe - note log scale on Y axis)Some reasons why fusion is a good technology for space1) Fusion has no critical mass requirement; all that a fusion reaction requires is the right conditions be met (temperature, plasma density, and confinement time) to support fusion. As a result, very tiny amounts of fusion fuel (grams) are initially required to begin production of industrially significant amounts of fusion power. Fusion scales more easily and elegantly both larger and smaller than any known fission reactor technology that is currently available that must contain at least a critical mass (and in practice, many hundred critical masses) of fission fuel to operate.2) Fusion fuels are widely available in space. Hydrogen (and deuterium) is the most abundant elements in the universe. Hydrogen is fully 10^10 times more abundant by atoms in the universe than any combination of fission fuels (U233, U235, Pu239).3) When fusion fails to work, it tends to just flame out, and serious accidents and melt downs do not tend to happen4) Neutrons and gammas produced by fission reactors are hard to shield for nuclear rocket propulsion or exploratory space ground vehicle applications. Charged particles like protons produced from He3-He3 fusion are somewhat easier and more cost effective to shield. A combination of magnetic fields and electrostatic fields can be used to provide a low mass solution for biological shielding needed to provide excellent operator safety for mobile He3-He3 Inertial Confinement fusion reactors.Aneutronic Helium3-Helium3 fusion - a candidate for space applicationsHe3 + He3-> He4 + 2 protons + 12.86 MeV (energy)He3-He3 fusion produces only charged protons and energy (no difficult to shield neutrons at all).Charged Protons produced from He3-He3 fusion can be collected on light weight grids and screens and used to directly power nuclear electric rocket propulsion or power a fusion-electric vehicle for surface planetary exploration. Neutronless He3-He3 fusion does not require an expensive precision turbine-generator to convert nuclear heat into electricity (for He3-He3 fusion, lower cost and lighter weight direct collection of charged particles on grids suffices and energy conversion efficiencies from 60 - 80% have been practically demonstrated).","3,658 followers",Brent Oster,3.6K,357,1.8M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-advantages-of-thorium-molten-salt-reactors-over-D-T-fusion-reactors-for-power-in-space
1,"A molten salt reactor has already melted down if it’s in operation. Think about it, the salt has to be molten in order to be piped around the system. What is there to melt down then?But, let’s say I introduce a surplus of U233 to the mix, which raises the reactivity of the slurry.(Yes, I said Uranium-233. Thorium-232 doesn’t react. It’s a neutron capture feed stock. When it captures a neutron, it goes through Beta decay and becomes Uranium-233. U233 is a self-fissile material that actually produces energy and extra neutrons. It’s the U233 bred from Th232 that drives a Thorium salt reactor. TheA molten salt reactor has already melted down if it’s in operation. Think about it, the salt has to be molten in order to be piped around the system. What is there to melt down then?But, let’s say I introduce a surplus of U233 to the mix, which raises the reactivity of the slurry.(Yes, I said Uranium-233. Thorium-232 doesn’t react. It’s a neutron capture feed stock. When it captures a neutron, it goes through Beta decay and becomes Uranium-233. U233 is a self-fissile material that actually produces energy and extra neutrons. It’s the U233 bred from Th232 that drives a Thorium salt reactor. The benefit is that, under normal operation, Thorium breeds 108% of the consumed U233 per year of operation. And Thorium is several million times easier to get than the U235 used in most modern reactors. Now… back to the answer.)The reactor core begins to heat up. The liquid salts begin to heat up, which causes them to… expand.The expanded fluids move the U233 atoms further apart. This reduces their effective target radius for expelled neutrons from fissioning U233 atoms, and the rate of reaction slows down, until some equilibrium is reached.In other words, adding more U233 heats up the reactor, but only to a certain extent. Keep adding more and the reactor keeps heating up. Remove the U233, or add more salt to thin it out, and the reactor cools down.This is one of the ways to “throttle” a molten salt reactor. You need more power, you add more fissile material. You need less, you either extract some fissile material or you add more inert salts. Most of them would be built with neutron eating control rods as well, but a simple “no moving parts” version could do it entirely by “adjusting the mix.”Okay, but what if you added a huge amount of U233?Then the reactor would get so hot that the “freeze plug” at the bottom of the reactor, made by electrically refrigerating molten salt back to where it solidifies, melts from the excess heat, and the super-critical fuel of the reactor dumps through a set of valves into separate small tanks.Each of these tanks are far below critical mass, and the reaction stops in its tracks, and the salt cools back down and hardens.In other words, when a molten salt reactor gets hot enough to “melt down” through the bottom of the tank where the freeze plug is, it uses a passive, gravity fed system to shut itself down in such a way that it’s totally safe.But….Let’s say you had a lunatic at the controls.He dumps dozens of times the normal amount of U233 into the reactor, and the increase in heat instantly causes vaporization of the molten salts. Now you have what is, effectively a “steam” explosion.But, unlike a boiling water reactor, there’s not a pressure vessel around the reactor, so the rapidly vaporizing salts spray up out of the reactor vessel into the inside of a containment building. Without a pressure vessel wrapped around it, there’s noWhere the salt blobs, now far below critical mass, solidify into solid blobs of slightly radioactive material.A bunch of guys in lead suits show up with brooms and lead containers, and collect all the salts from inside the building, and put them into the containers. The salts are taken to a processing plant, where the U233 is extracted back out chemically, and the fuel is reclaimed.The building is eventually cleaned up, the damaged reactor is repaired or replaced, and the lunatic is locked up in SuperMax for life.Total casualties… probably zero, unless some poor schmuck happened to be leaning over the reactor core at the time — which would probably be a bad idea anyway.So. Worst case, with a homicidal lunatic at the controls, he might be able to irradiate the inside of the containment building and kill a couple of people. Big deal, he could probably endanger more people with a pipe bomb made from baking soda and vinegar.Of course, there’s no way they’d actually have enough pure U233 on-hand to actually super-charge the reactor like that. There’d be no point. And if they did, then our Lunatic would be better off using it to make a dirty bomb or a nuke than trying to melt down the reactor.Molten salt reactors are just inherently safe because of their design. Even against lunatics.","2,203 followers",Iain McClatchie,668,411,2.8M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-advantages-of-thorium-molten-salt-reactors-over-D-T-fusion-reactors-for-power-in-space

The physics package — the actual bomb part — takes up about half the volume, the whole RV weighs 95 kg, and it has a yield of over 100 kilotons.So a modern-ish (actually more than 30 years old) thermonuclear weapon gives five times the yield of its merely nuclear ancestor and weighs about a fiftieth as much, a size-reduction of 250 times.

The physics package — the actual bomb part — takes up about half the volume, the whole RV weighs 95 kg, and it has a yield of over 100 kilotons.So a modern-ish (actually more than 30 years old) thermonuclear weapon gives five times the yield of its merely nuclear ancestor and weighs about a fiftieth as much, a size-reduction of 250 times. A pretty significant miniaturization, already, I think.Why further miniaturization is difficult is down to the physics and engineering. There aren’t any good pictures of the physics package of a W76, but here’s a naked W80, a cruise missile warhead of 150 kt yield:As a thermonuclear warhead, it is comprised of two parts: the fission primary, and the fusion secondary. The fission device is a nuclear weapon with a yield of around 5 kilotons. When this detonates, it irradiates a can of lithium deuteride fuel, causing the lithium to split into tritium and neutrons; the tritium then fuses with the deuterium, liberating more energy,InAbout the size of a softball. At detonation, this was crushed by the couple of tonnes of explosive around it so that it became dense enough that most of the neutrons created when the plutonium atoms split would hit other plutonium atoms — the so-called “critical mass” — producing 8.4 × 10¹³ joules of energy.Through clever engineering the required mass of plutonium in modern weapons to produce a chain reaction has been reduced by around half, and greatly reduced the amount of explosive needed. The yield is reduced to around a quarter, but the yield of the primary isn’t as important as the fact of it being a nuclear detonation next to the fusion fuel.A small quantity of lithium deuterideThe lithium deuteride yields about 50 kilotons per kilo of LiD, and the amount can be varied in the design up to hundreds of kilos, before it becomes more efficient to daisychain multiple secondaries off one primary. The W80 above therefore probably contains 3 kilos of LiD, or nearly four litres, while the W76 contains 2 kg. I guess the bottom limit might be arbitrarily small in theory, but probably isn’t worth pursuing, since you can do various things to a fission device to increase the yield instead.The bomb-maker’s rule of thumb for making a fission detonation is that you want around eighty generations of fissioning plutonium atoms emitting 2–3 neutrons per fission, most of which hit another plutonium atom, causing it to fission, and so on. Hypothetically, you might be able to squeeze more neutron-plutonium collisions out of a smaller lump of plutonium… somehow… but practically speaking, 3 kilos appears to be the limit of our engineering skill.Now, you can also make a fission weapon physically smaller than an office waste-bin. The W82 was a device designed to fit in a 6″ (155mm) artillery shell:The physics package was a tad smaller than 155mm in diameter and probably around 500mm long at most. This had a yield of only 2 kilotons, though, and used something like the 6 kilos of plutonium of an older bomb, because of the limitations on the clever things — as well as the explosives and plutonium — you can fit in something the volume of three boxes of wine (don’t judge me) to increase the yield.So, the short answer is that you need a good-sized lump of plutonium, a layer of explosives, and a certain amount of lithium deuteride to make your thermonuclear bomb, and we are probably near the limit of how much beryllium mirrors, neutron generators, tritium gas, uranium tampers, air lenses, and so on, we can add to make that more efficient.There might be room for miniaturisation in the design of anti-matter bombs down to whatever size you’re hoping for — if only we could produce enough antimatter for such a bomb, and knew how to build them.","84,239 followers",Igor Markov,2.1K,3.9K,49.8M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-advantages-of-thorium-molten-salt-reactors-over-D-T-fusion-reactors-for-power-in-space

The style of fusion device most likely to support this style of fusion is Inertial Confinement Fusion where fusion plasma is literally 10^11 times more dense than the fusion plasma routinely run in tokamak experiments like ITER.A argument can be made for Inertial Confinement Fussion in implementing extremely small reactors. ICF fusion experiments employ the densest fusion plasma. This is a strong competitive advantage asthe power that can be drawn from a plasma at fusion conditions is proportional to the second power (square) of the plasma densityEven small improvements in operating plasma density can significantly improve the chance that a specific fusion experiment achieves fusion with actual energy gain and produces useful amounts of power.

6,"No, probably not.So, the main stopping block to nuclear fusion is the lack of homogeneity in the plasma, which is only made worse with a smaller reactor, not better. Let me explain.

A small reactor would still need to have the radiation shielding and the surface area to volume is not in your favor.

It is remarkable that we (as a species) are even attempting it and more remarkable that we may well succeed.People seem to think that fusion is relatively easy, but itThere’s a reason stars burn for billions of years, they really only burn slowly.Now consider the conditions at the core of the sun - 250 billion atmospheres, 15 million degrees (K or C doesn’t matter at this scale). And that is sufficient to make a piddly amount of heat per cubic metre. Scaled down to operations that would fit on Earth, that’s not going to cut it for power generation. You’d get more power out of a single large solar panel in good conditions. (That might seem odd but consider the sheer size of the sun, even “just” the core region).What’s more, we can’t achieve those sorts of pressures so we need much higher temperatures before we even start fusion; closer to 100 million degrees. We then need to surround this heating zone with the kind of insulation a few hundred thousand miles worth of mind-bogglingly dense gas and plasma provides (using superpowered magnets), andI hope this gives you an idea of what an achievement creating a working fusion power plant will be. It should be considered like the Manhattan project or Apollo programme but way,It should be awe inspiring, and I hope I’ve conveyed a little of that awe.Here’s a photo of the pit in which they’re building the core at ITER. For scale, there is a person standing on the extreme left of the image about halfway down (9 o’clock position). The pressure vessel (the first section of which is complete and slowly making its way into this pit) will contain more steel than the Eiffel tower. Once running, the core will be the hottest place in the solar system, in fact it’ll be hotter than anywhere within around 100 light years of Earth as only blue supergiant stars get this hot at their cores.And ITER is just the small scale prototype. A final generating power plant will be significantly larger.I hope that blows your mind at least a little.","105,674 followers",Dave Consiglio,508,6.8K,91.6M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-advantages-of-thorium-molten-salt-reactors-over-D-T-fusion-reactors-for-power-in-space

My former father-in-law also worked at Lawrence Berkeley Labs, and was an engineer designing superconducting coil magnets and had decades of experience working with fusion researchers, even though his primary application was particle accelerators. From having many long conversations with these very intelligent and qualified people I realized that there are some really hard problems that block practical fusion, with no immediate solutions in sight.The only place we know of working, large-scale, energy-generating fusion reactions is at the center of a star, where the gravity of the massive star creates the necessary density, temperature, and time being held in that state at the core for fusion reactions to run continuously. This is called the Lawson criteria, and is hard to achieve. All of the layers of the star above that act as an energy exchanger, converting all the gamma rays and fast neutrons at the core into progressively less energetic wavelengths of light and motion of nuclei (heat) so by the time they reach the surface of the star, that energy is emitted as IR and visible light that heats and powers our planet's biosphere, and can provide photovoltaic energy to us as well. All of our efforts in fusion have been to try and reproduce this process on earth, in a small reactor that can provide practical energy.First I will talk aboutThe first problem with magnetic confinement is fundamental - no matter how strong or well formed the magnetic field containing the plasma is, it will always leak, as positive nuclei or ions spiralling around the magnetic field lines collide and scatter, eventually drifting out of the containment field. The only known solution is to make the reactor larger so the scattering ions take longer to travel to the plasma boundary, and thus more fusion can happen during that time. Pretty brute force.The world's most advanced magnetic confinement fusion power plant is ITER, which, to reduce the ion scattering problem mentioned above, is 6-stories tall and about the same dimension in diameter, containing the mass of 3 Eiffel towers, and it is still not expected to be large enough to contain a plasma long enough to sustain burning and produce continuous energy generation.A more practical problem is how do we extract the energy? Most of the energy in deuterium-tritium fusion reactions is released in fast, high-energy neutrons, which (because they are neutral, and have no electric charge) are not confined by the magnetic field, don't heat up the plasma, and have to be stopped by a thick shield, which then heats up, and can vaporize water to steam in order to power turbines and electrical generators. The problem is the constant bombardment by neutrons makes the shield material degrade with time, and become very radioactive, posing a problem for removal and disposal.Also, deuterium-tritium fusion reactions are currently used because they take place at the lowest energies and at the lowest plasma temperatures of all the possible fusion fuels, and thus are easier to ignite and keep lit. However, tritium is not found naturally in any significant quantities and needs to be manufactured in nuclear reactors. With today's production capacity, we just cannot make enough tritium to power even ITER continuously. We could use better fuels, like Helium-3 or Boron-11, which do not emit neutrons and thus 'burn clean', but the plasma temperature must be much higher and the confinement much better to ignite fusion and sustain it with these fuels. And while Boron-11 is plentiful, Helium-3 is so rare that scientists think that the best source of it is lunar regolith that has been irradiated for billions of years on the moon's surface. Any energy generation infrastructure that requires a regular supply of a moon-based fuel, even as energy dense as He3, will probably never work out.A proposed solution to the Tritium deficit is to construct the shield surrounding the reactor with lithium, which is abundant, and fissions into tritium when struck by neutrons, thereby 'breeding' tritium within the reactor itself. Of course, this comes with its own set of problems of how to capture, purify, and contain the tritium after it is released into the tokamak reaction chamber from the walls.Another issue is that when all of the superconducting magnets in ITER are running at full current (160,000 amps) to create the 13 Tesla toroidal magnetic field (13x that in an MRI machine) and to create the other plasma-shaping and heating fields, they are storing 60 GigaJoules, or around 12 Tons of TNT worth of energy. This is because the 180 kilometers of superconducting Niobium-Tin wires in all these massive magnet coils can carry enormous electrical current when supercooled with liquid helium.More info on the ITER magnets:But, if that cooling fails, the superconductor heats up, quenches, and becomes a normal conductor, and can no longer carry that enormous current. With 160,000 amps suddenly meeting resistance, the coil rapidly vaporizes, and causes a meltdown of the other coils, with a total energy release of 12 tons of TNT. This is very undesirable, especially when those coils are wrapped around a highly radioactive shield that also vaporizes and is expelled into the atmosphere. There are fault-detection systems, but it takes a while to dissipate that amount of energy safely, and there may not be enough time to react quickly enough in the event of a catastrophic magnet coil failure.So, some gotchas left to solve for practical fusion energy generation with magnetic confinement, with some perhaps not so easily solved.Inertial confinement fusionIt also has many of the same problems with energy conversion to electricity, and much worse wear and tear on the shielding from these small nuclear fusion explosions being set off, which also trashes all the precision equipment needed to hold the fuel pellet in the focus of the converging laser beams with extreme accuracy. So, a lot of practical damage control problems before inertial confinement fusion is a practical source of energy generation.While these problems may be solved, practical application is still a very long way off, and currently the main application of inertial confinement fusion is as an experimental testbed for calibrating computer codes used to simulate and design thermonuclear fusion weapons. As horrific as these weapons may be, the simulation codes developed for designing them (sorry maintaining them), are the one of the greatest tools for innovation in fusion energy. There is a hydrodynamics code which simulates the behavior of the fissile (and fusion) materials under extreme conditions of pressure and temperature, as well as transport codes that model neutron transport and scattering in the materials under these conditions, and many other bits and bobs. They are all standard numerical techniques, and the really classified part is the integration and calibration of all these codes with previous nuclear weapon tests from the past, and with these small scale simulations in the present.Electrostatic Confinement FusionBasically you need a vacuum container the size of a basketball and a pump to empty it. You put a small spherical wire cage the size of a golf ball in the center, and a larger wire cage the size of a bowling ball around it. You then pump out all the air, and apply a very large (10,000V) electrical potential between the two cages, with the small negative cathode at the center, and the positive anode at the periphery.Then you open a valve and let in a very small amount of Deuterium gas (commercially available) into the vacuum chamber, and it ionizes in the large voltage potential, the D+ ions in the periphery experience a very strong electric field (100K V/m), and are rapidly accelerated towards the center of the reactor, with enough energy to collide and fuse the deuterium nuclei (no tritium required). This fusion can be measured with an external neutron counter.Theoretically, power generation would be simple, as the fusion products consisting of highly energetic He3 and (few) H3 ions could be decelerated in an electric field and the current from that used to generate electricity directly.Here is ECG Herman’s excellent thesis paper on designing and constructing a Farnsworth Fusor:Although they seem like a obvious winners due to their simplicity and effectiveness, ECF reactors have several things limiting scaling:a) There is a limit to the deuterium gas density before performance degrades, so generation capacity is limited.b) Deuterium ions tend to collide with the wire cage cathode in the center, which absorbs them, heating the cage, and causing energy loss and contamination from metal atoms being dislodged.c) As the deuterium ions oscillate back and forth through the center, each time they change direction, they emit bremsstrahlung radiation, or photons of light, losing energy (this is how your dentist’s x-ray machine works).d) Scattering tends to reduce the nice, radial trajectories of the ions into a Maxwellian distribution over time, reducing the fusion that occurs.There has been work in using electromagnets at the periphery to try and hold a ball of electrons in the center, eliminating the need for a central cage… akaThermonuclear WeaponsIn the Teller-Ulam, two-stage, thermonuclear weapon, a spherical plutonium fission primary (with deuterium-tritium fusion fuel at the core to boost it) is imploded by conventional explosives, the plutonium is crushed far beyond critical density, fissions and detonates. The initial radiation released is contained and focused onto the fusion secondary to implode it, ignite fusion, and detonate it. I just mention this to illustrate the enormous energy needed to really reach the Lawson criteria in a large scale, but nuclear weapons kind of freak me out, so I'm going to refer you to the link to the Wikipedia article about them if you want to read more:Thermonuclear weapon - WikipediaSo, in summary, we should not shut down or stop building today's fission nuclear reactors, as commercial fusion reactors are not only far in the future, but also produce radioactive waste (their shielding, which needs to be periodically replaced), and Tokamaks can melt down catastrophically and explode if there is a cooling failure in the magnet coils during full power operation. They also do not run on seawater, like some say. We need expensive and difficult to produce tritium (which is also radioactive) to ignite fusion at the temperatures and densities that today's tokamak magnetic fields can produce.To advance fusion energy in your career, I think the best fields to study would be physics (classical, electrodynamics, plasma, quantum, nuclear…) and computer science, with a focus on numerical simulation. The actual physical fusion reactors are so expensive and time-consuming to build, test, and operate, that you may only get to iterate designs once or twice in a career, but computer simulations can take us in so many different directions more cheaply and easily by comparison.Perhaps there is some exotic stellarator magnetic confinement design, or advanced Farnsworth electrostatic confinement design that has not been explored in depth, that will turn out to hold the key to fusion energy. Simulation is probably the best first step to find it, unless you have a few billion dollars and several hundred kilometers of Niobium-Tin wire and helium cooling tubing to play with.Brent","105,674 followers",Dave Consiglio,4.5K,6.8K,91.6M,2021,https://www.quora.com/How-small-can-a-fusion-reactor-be

This results in temperatures 20 times greater than the sun’s core and a magnetic field equivalent to 1,000 times that of the earth’s normal magnetic field.SST-1 experiment achievements have strengthened India’s position in an elite club of nations with expertise in Fusion energy and building functional Fusion reactor device.iii) ITER (International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor):This is a joint megaproject of European Union, US, Russia, China, Japan, South Korea and India (35 countries) to build world’s largest Fusion reactor that can generate 500 MW power.

From having many long conversations with these very intelligent and qualified people I realized that there are some really hard problems that block practical fusion, with no immediate solutions in sight.The only place we know of working, large-scale, energy-generating fusion reactions is at the center of a star, where the gravity of the massive star creates the necessary density, temperature, and time being held in that state at the core for fusion reactions to run continuously. This is called the Lawson criteria, and is hard to achieve. All of the layers of the star above that act as an energy exchanger, converting all the gamma rays and fast neutrons at the core into progressively less energetic wavelengths of light and motion of nuclei (heat) so by the time they reach the surface of the star, that energy is emitted as IR and visible light that heats and powers our planet's biosphere, and can provide photovoltaic energy to us as well. All of our efforts in fusion have been to try and reproduce this process on earth, in a small reactor that can provide practical energy.First I will talk aboutThe first problem with magnetic confinement is fundamental - no matter how strong or well formed the magnetic field containing the plasma is, it will always leak, as positive nuclei or ions spiralling around the magnetic field lines collide and scatter, eventually drifting out of the containment field. The only known solution is to make the reactor larger so the scattering ions take longer to travel to the plasma boundary, and thus more fusion can happen during that time. Pretty brute force.The world's most advanced magnetic confinement fusion power plant is ITER, which, to reduce the ion scattering problem mentioned above, is 6-stories tall and about the same dimension in diameter, containing the mass of 3 Eiffel towers, and it is still not expected to be large enough to contain a plasma long enough to sustain burning and produce continuous energy generation.A more practical problem is how do we extract the energy? Most of the energy in deuterium-tritium fusion reactions is released in fast, high-energy neutrons, which (because they are neutral, and have no electric charge) are not confined by the magnetic field, don't heat up the plasma, and have to be stopped by a thick shield, which then heats up, and can vaporize water to steam in order to power turbines and electrical generators. The problem is the constant bombardment by neutrons makes the shield material degrade with time, and become very radioactive, posing a problem for removal and disposal.Also, deuterium-tritium fusion reactions are currently used because they take place at the lowest energies and at the lowest plasma temperatures of all the possible fusion fuels, and thus are easier to ignite and keep lit. However, tritium is not found naturally in any significant quantities and needs to be manufactured in nuclear reactors. With today's production capacity, we just cannot make enough tritium to power even ITER continuously. We could use better fuels, like Helium-3 or Boron-11, which do not emit neutrons and thus 'burn clean', but the plasma temperature must be much higher and the confinement much better to ignite fusion and sustain it with these fuels. And while Boron-11 is plentiful, Helium-3 is so rare that scientists think that the best source of it is lunar regolith that has been irradiated for billions of years on the moon's surface. Any energy generation infrastructure that requires a regular supply of a moon-based fuel, even as energy dense as He3, will probably never work out.A proposed solution to the Tritium deficit is to construct the shield surrounding the reactor with lithium, which is abundant, and fissions into tritium when struck by neutrons, thereby 'breeding' tritium within the reactor itself. Of course, this comes with its own set of problems of how to capture, purify, and contain the tritium after it is released into the tokamak reaction chamber from the walls.Another issue is that when all of the superconducting magnets in ITER are running at full current (160,000 amps) to create the 13 Tesla toroidal magnetic field (13x that in an MRI machine) and to create the other plasma-shaping and heating fields, they are storing 60 GigaJoules, or around 12 Tons of TNT worth of energy. This is because the 180 kilometers of superconducting Niobium-Tin wires in all these massive magnet coils can carry enormous electrical current when supercooled with liquid helium.More info on the ITER magnets:But, if that cooling fails, the superconductor heats up, quenches, and becomes a normal conductor, and can no longer carry that enormous current. With 160,000 amps suddenly meeting resistance, the coil rapidly vaporizes, and causes a meltdown of the other coils, with a total energy release of 12 tons of TNT. This is very undesirable, especially when those coils are wrapped around a highly radioactive shield that also vaporizes and is expelled into the atmosphere. There are fault-detection systems, but it takes a while to dissipate that amount of energy safely, and there may not be enough time to react quickly enough in the event of a catastrophic magnet coil failure.So, some gotchas left to solve for practical fusion energy generation with magnetic confinement, with some perhaps not so easily solved.Inertial confinement fusionIt also has many of the same problems with energy conversion to electricity, and much worse wear and tear on the shielding from these small nuclear fusion explosions being set off, which also trashes all the precision equipment needed to hold the fuel pellet in the focus of the converging laser beams with extreme accuracy. So, a lot of practical damage control problems before inertial confinement fusion is a practical source of energy generation.While these problems may be solved, practical application is still a very long way off, and currently the main application of inertial confinement fusion is as an experimental testbed for calibrating computer codes used to simulate and design thermonuclear fusion weapons. As horrific as these weapons may be, the simulation codes developed for designing them (sorry maintaining them), are the one of the greatest tools for innovation in fusion energy. There is a hydrodynamics code which simulates the behavior of the fissile (and fusion) materials under extreme conditions of pressure and temperature, as well as transport codes that model neutron transport and scattering in the materials under these conditions, and many other bits and bobs. They are all standard numerical techniques, and the really classified part is the integration and calibration of all these codes with previous nuclear weapon tests from the past, and with these small scale simulations in the present.Electrostatic Confinement FusionBasically you need a vacuum container the size of a basketball and a pump to empty it. You put a small spherical wire cage the size of a golf ball in the center, and a larger wire cage the size of a bowling ball around it. You then pump out all the air, and apply a very large (10,000V) electrical potential between the two cages, with the small negative cathode at the center, and the positive anode at the periphery.Then you open a valve and let in a very small amount of Deuterium gas (commercially available) into the vacuum chamber, and it ionizes in the large voltage potential, the D+ ions in the periphery experience a very strong electric field (100K V/m), and are rapidly accelerated towards the center of the reactor, with enough energy to collide and fuse the deuterium nuclei (no tritium required). This fusion can be measured with an external neutron counter.Theoretically, power generation would be simple, as the fusion products consisting of highly energetic He3 and (few) H3 ions could be decelerated in an electric field and the current from that used to generate electricity directly.Here is ECG Herman’s excellent thesis paper on designing and constructing a Farnsworth Fusor:Although they seem like a obvious winners due to their simplicity and effectiveness, ECF reactors have several things limiting scaling:a) There is a limit to the deuterium gas density before performance degrades, so generation capacity is limited.b) Deuterium ions tend to collide with the wire cage cathode in the center, which absorbs them, heating the cage, and causing energy loss and contamination from metal atoms being dislodged.c) As the deuterium ions oscillate back and forth through the center, each time they change direction, they emit bremsstrahlung radiation, or photons of light, losing energy (this is how your dentist’s x-ray machine works).d) Scattering tends to reduce the nice, radial trajectories of the ions into a Maxwellian distribution over time, reducing the fusion that occurs.There has been work in using electromagnets at the periphery to try and hold a ball of electrons in the center, eliminating the need for a central cage… akaThermonuclear WeaponsIn the Teller-Ulam, two-stage, thermonuclear weapon, a spherical plutonium fission primary (with deuterium-tritium fusion fuel at the core to boost it) is imploded by conventional explosives, the plutonium is crushed far beyond critical density, fissions and detonates. The initial radiation released is contained and focused onto the fusion secondary to implode it, ignite fusion, and detonate it. I just mention this to illustrate the enormous energy needed to really reach the Lawson criteria in a large scale, but nuclear weapons kind of freak me out, so I'm going to refer you to the link to the Wikipedia article about them if you want to read more:Thermonuclear weapon - WikipediaSo, in summary, we should not shut down or stop building today's fission nuclear reactors, as commercial fusion reactors are not only far in the future, but also produce radioactive waste (their shielding, which needs to be periodically replaced), and Tokamaks can melt down catastrophically and explode if there is a cooling failure in the magnet coils during full power operation. They also do not run on seawater, like some say. We need expensive and difficult to produce tritium (which is also radioactive) to ignite fusion at the temperatures and densities that today's tokamak magnetic fields can produce.To advance fusion energy in your career, I think the best fields to study would be physics (classical, electrodynamics, plasma, quantum, nuclear…) and computer science, with a focus on numerical simulation. The actual physical fusion reactors are so expensive and time-consuming to build, test, and operate, that you may only get to iterate designs once or twice in a career, but computer simulations can take us in so many different directions more cheaply and easily by comparison.Perhaps there is some exotic stellarator magnetic confinement design, or advanced Farnsworth electrostatic confinement design that has not been explored in depth, that will turn out to hold the key to fusion energy. Simulation is probably the best first step to find it, unless you have a few billion dollars and several hundred kilometers of Niobium-Tin wire and helium cooling tubing to play with.Brent","51,719 followers",Chris Ebbert,1.1K,11.4K,278.6M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Using-unclassified-info-why-is-the-miniaturization-of-thermonuclear-weapons-so-difficult

21,"In terms of raw destructive power and strategic significance, India is ahead.So more strategic level warheads, more raw destructiveIn terms of raw destructive power and strategic significance, India is ahead.So more strategic level warheads, more raw destructive force and a full triad. So as far as a full nuclear exchange with another state is concerned, both in terms of deterrence and first strike: India is ahead of Pakistan.In terms of tactical flexibility? Pakistan for the moment.So while Pakistan has its own strategic arsenal with large kTs, it is nowhere near India in terms of kT per warhead. There have been reports about Pakistan boosting the kT yields on its warheads using Tritium. These Tritium boosted nuclear weapons offer greater firepower and i think they are in the 36–40kT range. But mathematically speaking, India still has more firepower in warhead terms on paper. Also, the Pakistani weapons production program has a growing skew towards smaller warheads with more limited size and range but greater tactical flexibility.As you can see, the nuclear weapons of both countries reflect their nuclear doctrines. India currently has a No-First use policy although this might be withdrawn soon in the case of Pakistan (And India also needs a large numbers of powerful warheads so you have a significant amount remaining if India is hit by an enemy state’s nuclear First strike in order to inflict sufficient retalation on your attacker.Pakistan meanwhile, used to follow the old “Minimum Credible deterrence”. Back in the pre-2010 era, this meant having enough of a nuclear arsenal to stave off an invasion that threatened the existence of Pakistan as a state. It implied first use. In more detail, it implied a limited first use to stop the invasion before Pakistani forces collapsed completely and lost key areas. And if the first use was responded to by a devastating second strike from the enemy, then to fire off the remaining arsenal and meet up for drinks in the afterlife.And our program used to reflect that by having a significant amount of large strategic warheads only. Just enough to survive a first strike attempt and ensure deterrence in the face of foreign invasion.Post 2010, when India’s Cold Start doctrine gained prominence, the nuclear doctrine changed. Now the Pakistan army was faced with the threat of Indian integrated battle groups rapidly advancing into Pakistani territory with little to no mobilization time required in order to hold small, strategic slices of territory to be used as bargaining chips in a negotiation. So, it wasn’t a full blown Indian invasion that threatened the state of Pakistan. It was a very limited one, designed to capture territory to force concessions from Pakistan. The Minimum Credible Deterrence doctrine was of limited use here. No one can justify nuking New Delhi just because India is holding 100 sq Kms of territory in Sialkot sector.So the doctrine was changed. Nuclear weapons began to be seen more as “useful artillery”. A noticeable shift occurred, away from large strategic level warheads towards smaller, tactical warheads. Weapons to be used on the battlefield to thwart the conventionally superior Indian forces. Because the increasing conventional gap between India and Pakistan as well as the uneven economic growth means that any conventional race with India is doomed from the start. So why not close the gap with smaller nuclear weapons that offer greater tactical options and flexibility? Or so the thinking went.Of course, India responded with the statement that any use of nuclear weapons by Pakistan would entail a nuclear response from India even if Pakistan used those weapons on it’s own territory. Which the Pakistani’s dismissed.And herein lies another problem: neither side acknowledges the red lines of the enemy. Pakistan doesn’t recognize or take India’s red lines seriously. India doesn’t recognize Pakistan’s red lines or takes them seriously. Which increases the confusion about expected responses from both sides and greatly increases the threat and danger of an uncontrolled, escalating nuclear exchange during war.Back in the cold war era, it was quite clear to both the USSR and US what exactly would provoke a full blown nuclear exchange or war between both states. Which is how they managed to avert one crises after the other from the Cuban missile crises, the Israeli drive towards Damascus in 73, the Korean war, the Vietnam and Afghan Wars and so on.In the case of India and Pakistan, this is more…uncertain.ConclusionIt’s senseless to compare raw kTs of warheads and warhead numbers for India and Pakistan because it would be an apples and oranges comparison.Both states have designed their programs around their doctrines, their national security objectives and their national capabilities.A larger strategic arsenal with higher destructive power would be useless to Pakistan. Our entire program is designed to fight and defend against a limited war waged by conventionally superior Indian forces. If we had more strategic warheads, they would be useless for battlefield use because of the threat they posed to our own forces and civilians in the area. We need nukes that augment the firepower of our conventional forces in the field while they fight on our territory. This would raise the stakes of the war, bring in foreign mediation to end the conflict and maintain the threshold of nuclear exchange at a minimum acceptable level (that is, not take things to a point where a full nuclear exchange between India and Pakistan becomes inevitable).Similarly, smaller tactical nukes are useless to India. They already have conventional dominance in the region and their growing economy will further cement this lead. Why would they ever need tactical nuclear weapons in the first place? Their conventional forces have more than enough firepower to handle fighting with enemy forces in the region.What matters is whether the nuclear programs meet the needs and requirements of both states.As of now, India’s needs are already being met in terms of nuclear arsenal. So they are changing direction and looking more at anti-ballistic missile defense systems (ABMs). Their primary concern these days seems to be stopping the threat of Pakistani missiles and nullifying Pakistan’s nuclear advantage entirely by negating their most reliable delivery platform: Ballistic Missiles.Indian forces are also investing heavily in NBC and EMP resistant equipment that would permit forces to survive and continue the fight in a nuclear battlefield.On the other hand, while Pakistan’s strategic needs are pretty much met same as India, Pakistan’s tactical nuclear weapon needs aren’t completely being met at the moment which is why its arsenal is still growing in number. Pakistan currently, is focused on:For the foreseeable future, this arms race is bound to continue. India will continue to invest in strategic programs designed to gain superiority over not just Pakistan but China as well in the nuclear sphere. Pakistan will continue to try and find ways around them, possibly with the assistance of China’s more advanced technological capabilities.I’d recommend buying stock in companies that make lead coffins.SideNote:-Just a small diversion but this is actually an important point. The use of tactical weapons and their effect on field formations is one of the most hazy and heavily classified subjects available. On one hand, studies have shown that armored formations in buttoned down hatch mode suffer limited damage from nuclear strikes. Especially if they have embedded NBC and EMP protections.On the other hand, there are other reports that if nuclear weapons are used in a concentrated and consistent manner like artillery is used, they are capable of significant damage over a wide area regardless of NBC protection or not. The resulting sand storms caused by nuclear strikes are also murder on Tank engines and visibility. Radiation generates intense background noise on all communications equipment that manages to survive the EMP shock wave. Intense heat in blast zones also makes it impossible to man armored vehicles that don’t have internal cooling systems. And of course, infantry in the area will suffer long term health hazards.This is one of those weapons and scenarios that only become apparent once those weapons are actually used.It’s expected that similar to the 1986–1987 when Pakistan was faced with the Indian Brasstacks, the central and southern theaters will be largely left with a few holding and harassing/counterattack troops while the bulk of the main fighting formations will be shifted north to hold fortified areas like Lahore, Sialkot, AJK etc. This is because border regions of northern, heavily populated territories like Lahore etc do not permit tactical nuclear weapons usage. Same might go for the Sukkur-RYK axis.The open desert areas of Sindh and Southern Punjab which are sparsely populated and offer a buffer. They will likely see the heaviest nuclear bombardment. I have read somewhere that wind patterns in Indo Pak region generally run from Pakistan towards India so nuclear fallout is expected to blow over towards Indian territory.
