Since we didn’t have a way to store electricity, we could not analyse its behaviours - and, therefore, we could not explain electrical properties - which would lead to the invention of new electrical/electronic devices. We wouldn’t have electric inter-communication, wireless well- anything, this would be a much older time to live.In the yearThis led to a greaterIn 1821,The motor used a bath ofThe firstThis motor design was then improved upon until it was discovered that the process wasTo keep this answer concise, I will quickly summarise the remaining major inventions:In 1833, Farraday invented the thermistor and the laws ofMoritz von Jacobi created the first ‘real’ rotating electric1836 - Nicholas Callan invented the electric1837 - Edward Davy invented the1844 - The first electrical1845 - Kirchoff developed -non-other-than-1855 - First utilisation of1873 - Zenobe Gramme discovered that his DC generator could be used as a DC motor (developing the first1877 - Thomas Alva Edison invented the1877 - Werner von Siemens invented the1879 - Thomas Edison patentedMost modern electrical inventions, such as semi-conductor usage and components were developed in the 1900s.And that is a brief summary of what the invention of a battery led to.Thank youPhoto References:Further reading:",0 followers,Jake Mawson,1.1K,55,425.5K,2022,https://www.quora.com/What-s-an-invention-or-technology-that-hit-its-peak-and-cannot-advance-any-farther

Paper towels are faster to use and they do a better job drying your hands.But, did you know that hand dryers are less hygenic than paper towels?The real argument that dryer companies make, though, is that paper towel waste is bad for the environment. That's only a little true; lSome people worry about the trees we have to cut down, but paper towels are usually made from recycled wood pulp, and they don’t need the really nasty binders or bleaches. The related problem of paper waste can be solved if we just put a bit of effort in; paper towels are easily biodegradable and can be composted. By fitting paper towels into the middle of a recycling stream, we don't need to cut down any trees, and no trash has to go to a landfill.Long story short, paper towels are a clean, hygienic, and sustainable bathroom solution, and hand dryers are a completely unnecessary replacement that’s actively worse.I’m tired of having soggy hands for no good reason.2020 edit:",269 followers,Karthik Reddy L,16K,0,0,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-s-an-invention-or-technology-that-hit-its-peak-and-cannot-advance-any-farther
