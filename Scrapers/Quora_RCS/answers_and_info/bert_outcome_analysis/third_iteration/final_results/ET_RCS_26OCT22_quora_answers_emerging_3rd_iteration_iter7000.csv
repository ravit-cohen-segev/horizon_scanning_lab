Not to be left behind, you have to learn all the time.It’s all about curiosity and flexible thinking.

Here we go!Follow tech people you admire on social media (Twitter, Facebook, Clubhouse)There exists multiple ways for full-stack developers to keep up with their technology stack.The most important thing is to do the following before: define your motivations, analyze your learning style, and set SMART goals.Only after that should you choose some of the most relevant and appropriate ways to master your skills.","1,713 followers",Don Sevcik,2.9K,200,4.3M,2021,https://www.quora.com/How-do-full-stack-developers-keep-up-with-their-technology-stack

2,"For most developers in a corporate setting, there is no need to stay abreast with the very latest and greatest. Even small companies rarely move to a new technology stack that quickly. When they start out, they might choose to be cutting edge, but, as you say, that status doesn’t last too long.The problem with the latest and greatest is that, while it may be the former, it is rarely the latter until it has time to mature. It may have certain advantages over an established framework in terms of capabilities or ease-of-use, but it probably is woefully behind in terms of support, 3rd party librarFor most developers in a corporate setting, there is no need to stay abreast with the very latest and greatest. Even small companies rarely move to a new technology stack that quickly. When they start out, they might choose to be cutting edge, but, as you say, that status doesn’t last too long.The problem with the latest and greatest is that, while it may be the former, it is rarely the latter until it has time to mature. It may have certain advantages over an established framework in terms of capabilities or ease-of-use, but it probably is woefully behind in terms of support, 3rd party libraries, and examples. All of those things make it less useful than sticking with the tried and true, or at least yesterdays latest and greatest.Generally, companies want to either use or be able to sell the software they produce for an extended period of time - as in years. That software needs to be supported and maintained. New features may be added, existing ones may be modified, etc. You probably will be able to make some incremental changes to the technology stack in use. Doing more than that gets expensive and so is unlikely to happen very often. A complete change in the technology stack likely requires a completely new product. That really isn’t cost-effective to do frequently.","82,154 followers",Quincy Larson,3.4K,358,29.1M,2017,https://www.quora.com/How-do-full-stack-developers-keep-up-with-their-technology-stack
3,"I don't know that full stack means mastery, but rather competency across the stack. Most full stack developers have mastered just one piece of their stack, and gain competency in the rest. When you view it through that lens, it's not so hard to stay abreast of everything.I am first and foremost a PHP developer. I've made that clear at every interview I've had as a full stack developer. That said, I also make it clear that I am comfortable on the front end, design database schema and doing basic infrastructure management.Am I a full stack developer? Yes. Am I a master of the entire stack? AbsolI don't know that full stack means mastery, but rather competency across the stack.
