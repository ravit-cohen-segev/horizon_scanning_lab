1,"He-3 fusion does have some advantages.Fusion reactions produce easier to shield radiation than the penetrating gamma radiation produced by most forms of nuclear fission. The more common neutron fusion reactions like Deuterium-Tritium (DT) or Deuterium-Deuterium (DD) produce energetic neutrons that while dangerous, can be blocked by relatively light and relatively inexpensive materials like Borated High Density PolyethylenHe-3 fusion does have some advantages.Fusion reactions produce easier to shield radiation than the penetrating gamma radiation produced by most forms of nuclear fission. The more common neutron fusion reactions like Deuterium-Tritium (DT) or Deuterium-Deuterium (DD) produce energetic neutrons that while dangerous, can be blocked by relatively light and relatively inexpensive materials like Borated High Density Polyethylene Plastic, which can be conveniently cast into custom shapes as needed to safely shield a neutron producing fusion reactor.There are also aneutronic fusion reactions that occur at higher temperatures and plasma pressures like p-B11 and D-He3 that produce charged particles like protons or alpha particles instead of neutrons. Charged particles like protons can be efficiently collected on screens and plates and used to directly produce electricity by magneto-hydrodynamic energy converters at very high efficiencies and with no moving parts to wear out. At least one current fusion experiment, Dense Plasma Focus fusion at LPP Fusion , has achieved the high temperatures and confinement times needed to produce aneutronic fusion (LPP Fusion is currently working on improving plasma pressure - the last condition it needs to satisfy to achieve the requirements for aneutronic fusion). Fission ignited Fusion also can reach the fusion triple-product needed to produce aneutronic fusion (but no fusion experiments with aneutronic fuels were ever conducted by Test program to my knowledge).Even if you achieve the extreme simultaneous requirements for D-He3 or He3-He3 fusion, fusion cross sections and fusion reaction rates for neutron producing fusion reactions like D-T and D-D fusion are much more attractive, by many orders of magnitude, than for the He3 reactions.A graph of fusion reaction cross section for different fusion reactions versus temperature (keV)-The D-He3 reaction has better fusion reaction rates at lower temperatures, but it is not totally aneutronic and still produces some fast 14.1 MeV neutrons that have to be shielded to provide operator safety.It may not be necessary to go to the moon to obtain secure supplies of He-3Manufacturing (2.3 x 10^13 metric tons) of He3 worldwide from modified D-D fusion of sea water would open up many fusion application that are now not seriously considered, including fueling nuclear fusion based transportation (fusion powered ships, planes, trains, cars, and rockets to the stars).The fusion reaction that has the best fusion reaction rates at temperatures we know how to produce in machines we know how to build is the followingD + He3 -> He-4 + proton (18.3 MeV energy) (aneutronic)The reaction rates for D+He3 fusion is comparable to D-D fusion, and the D+He3 fusion reaction has the advantage of producing mostly charged protons that are easy to shield and easy to use to directly convert fusion energy into electrical energy at high efficiency.In the space advocacy community, it is not uncommon to encounter supporters of going to the moon to obtain He3 fuel. What is generally not mentioned is the fact that it may be possible to manufacture He3 more cheaply on earth by tuning D-D fusion reactors to produce both energy and He3 fuel as they operate while burning ubiquitous Deuterium fuel obtained from sea water.Terrestrially rare He3 can potentially be produced in stationary earth bound D-D fusion reactor that operates with the fusion side-chain suppressed that normally burns He3 in situ.The D-D fusion reaction has two branches that occur with nearly equal probability:D + D	→ T	+ 1HD + D	→ 3He	+ nBy properly tuning the operating conditions of a D-D ICF fusion reactor, it should be possible to make the ICF fusion reactor produce both fusion energy and He3 fuel.Manufacturing (2.3 x 10^13 metric tons) of He3 worldwide from modified D-D fusion of sea water would open up many fusion application that are now not seriously considered, including fueling nuclear fusion based transportation.Note: The amount of Deuterium in seawater is very vast (4.6 x 10^13 metric tons). The amount of He3 that could be produced from a modified form of D-D fusion that suppresses the He3 sidechain is similarly vast (2.3 x 10^13 metric tons).D-D fusion normally produces He3D-D Fusion of Deuterium fuel produces energy through four reactions:D + D -> He-3 + n + 3.268 MeVD + D -> T + p + 4.03 MeV(side chains)D + T -> He-4 + n + 17.588 MeVHe-3 + D -> He-4 + p + 18.34 MeVThe net effect of these four fusion reactions taken together is:6 D -> 2 He-4 + 2p + 2n + 43.243 MeVSince He3 reactions occur at higher temperatures and plasma pressures, it should be possible to configure a D-D fusion reactor to operate just below the conditions needed to burn He3 at high reaction rates and make such a D-D fusion reactor an He3 fuel manufacturing facility.Most fusion analysts only consider the D + He3 fusion reaction among He3 fuel burning fusion reactions because it has among the highest fusion reaction rates of aneutronic fusion reactions. It might be valuable, however, to mention another aneutronic He-3 fusion reaction that has several exceptional characteristics that may one day make it very important.Helium3-Helium3 fusionHe3 + He3-> He4 + 2 protons + 12.86 MeV (energy)He3-He3 fusion produces only charged protons and energy (no difficult to shield neutrons at all).What are some of the characteristics of He3-He3 fusion that makes it exceptional?Charged Protons produced from He3-He3 fusion can be collected on light weight grids and screens and used to directly power electric motors that actually drive the wheels of a nuclear car. Neutronless He3-He3 fusion does not require an expensive precision turbine-generator to convert nuclear heat into electricity (for He3-He3 fusion, lower cost and lighter weight direct collection of charged particles on grids suffices).Collecting He3 from D-D fusion reactors adjusted to suppress He3 fusion allows this He3 aneutronic fusion fuel to be produced significantly more cheaply than going into space for it.Inertial Confinement Fusion operates using by far the highest density fusion plasma and this is significant from the standpoint of building a small and economic power reactor. The power that can be drawn from a burning plasma at fusion conditions is proportional to the square of the density of the fusion plasma. The denser the fusion plasma, the more energy that can be extracted from it.Inertial Confinement Fusion power plants that employ He3-He3 fusion could be small if desired (both in physical size and in power output). Teaming stationary D-D fusion reactors tuned to produce energy and He3 fuel with smaller mobile reactors burning He3 aneutronic fuel for fusion transportation applications would cover a large portion of mankind’s need for reliable and clean energy and could usher in an exciting new technical age and an end to worldwide energy scarcity and poverty that typically results from lack of access to energy.Sometime within the next decade we should see experimentally whether a tuned ICF D-D fusion reactor using abundant and cheap non-radioactive Deuterium separated from the world's oceans is capable of producing significant quantities of He-3 fuel which can be scavenged from the debris left in the evacuated ICF fusion chamber following a power producing fusion shot.","3,658 followers",Brent Oster,3.6K,357,1.8M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-could-be-the-weight-of-smallest-possible-nuclear-reactor

When your fuel is solid you have to shut down the reactor to refuel it. First you let it cool off, then pull the top off to open it up.Then pull out the most-used fuel assemblies from the center of the reactor, and then move the less-used fuel assemblies towards the center of the reactor.Check that everything is as it should be, then close up the reactor, check everything again, and finally restart the reactor. The plant is down for months doing this. That’s the bad news. The good news is that this is a scheduled outage, likely performed at a time of the year when less power is needed (eg spring or fall), and so the grid operators can plan around the outage.Oh, there is another reason you have to replace the most-used solid fuel assemblies every so often. Let’s face it, being a fuel pellet in a running reactor is not the most gentle way to pass your time. You crack because of thermal stresses and because of single atoms of uranium being replaced by two atoms of fission product taking up more space and making the fuel swell. Being the cladding holding the fuel pellets in place is not a gentle way to make a living either. So quite aside from the amount of fissionable material dropping to levels which are too low, the fuel assemblies have to be replaced before the cladding degrades.So that’s why today’s nuclear power reactors must be shut down periodically thus giving them a capacity factor of about 90%.Oh, BTW, solar and wind have capacity factors which, on average, are about 25% and 33% depending on where they are placed. AND their down time is in totallyThe alternative to a solid fuel reactor is a liquid fuel reactor. Among a whole lot of other benefits, a liquid fuel reactor can be refueled while it runs, and the fission products can also be removed as the reactor runs too. So, there would be no downtime for refueling.We had one of these running effortlessly a HALF A CENTURY AGO.20:31If the above seems hokey like it was made 50 years ago or something, that is because it was made 50 years ago.

While we were in the northern part of the Indian Ocean, a hurricane (can’t remember the name for a hurricane in the Indian Ocean, maybe a Willy Willy?) hit the island nation of Mauritius (east of Madagascar by several hundred miles) really hard and knocked out all the power. We sailed our task group to them to help. We arrived about 12 hours after the storm had moved on. While we had a lot of provisions and other help methods available on all of the ships, they would only allow one ship to enter port so as not to embarrass the Russians, who had also dispatched a cruiser to help (1975, still in the Cold War). The Enterprise hooked in to the local grid and powered the main city for a couple of days until they got things back up. They also provided food and fresh water, as well as medical assistance, both in the city and aboard the ship. Carriers have a pretty significant sick bay which is like a small hospital. The rest of us sailed in circles while we waited. We were shipping supplies and personnel to help off by helicopter, though. Reports are that the place was a big mess, but that we had saved a lot of lives by being there. The carriers are like a huge floating power plant, and while they would normally hook up to shore power so they could shut down their power plants, they can provide a lot of juice to the shore in a situation like this.

Unfortunately he has missed the point entirely. NO ONE is claiming that fusion reactors will (or even should be) small, cheap, replace gasoline engines or any other such nonsense.  Fusion reactors are simply a better way of generating electricity in a world that is hungry for more and more electricity every year. Any device that can meet that demand, even partially, without adding to the ongoing problems of air/carbon/greenhouse gas pollution and nuclear waste IS, in fact, world changing.Before I begin, let’s define what fusion IS and what it IS NOT so that we’re operating from a solid foundation. I’ll begin with the definition from Encyclopedia Britannica:In other words, fusion is a source of electricity. It is NOT ‘free energy’ and no one is claiming that it is.NOW let’s look at the (widely accepted) ADVANTAGES OF FUSION ENERGY:Fusion Energy Foundation Goals, Initiatives and AdvantagesBut don’t take my word for it:Ok, now we know that we’re talking about something simple - electricity - so let's take his arguments point by point and I'll explain why he is incorrect.1.) Fusion Doesn’t Mean SmallCOUNTERPOINT:2.) ""COUNTERPOINT:Fusion is an energy source, not a propulsion system. Any attempt to compare the two is wrong from the get-go. Fusion reactors don’t NEED to be small enough to cram into an automobile in order to change the world. They only need to produce clean electrical energy. From there that energy can be delivered to homes, businesses and charging stations that can/will/are used to power electrical vehicles. As the automobile fleets of the world transition to electrical vehicles the need for clean abundant energy will increase year upon year. Fusion can help meet that demand by replacing aging coal-fired and traditional fission power plants thus nullifying their negative environmental impacts, i.e. nuclear accidents (Fukushima, Three Mile Island, Chernobyl) and carbon (a typical coal plant emits between 7,000 and 14,000 tons of carbon per year.To put it more simply, to change the world fusion reactors need only to replace coal-fired and nuclear fission power plants. The dirtiest and most dangerous sources of power. Even if that’s ALL they did that would be enough to ‘change the world’.BUT that’s not the end of this counterpoint! Lockheed Martin is presently developing a compact fusion reactor that is “small enough to fit on a truck"" (their words). From their site: ""A reactor small enough to fit on a truck could provide enough power for a small city of up to 100,000 people.”Compact Fusion2.)COUNTERPOINT:Putting cars and trucks aside for a moment, the U.S. Navy is already powering fleets of ships and submarines using small-scale nuclear reactors - so it CAN be done on ships, subs and in aircraft. Replacing those fission reactors with small-scale fusion reactors is not only technically feasible it’s preferable from a strategic standpoint as the fuel source for fusion reactors, deuterium, is derived from seawater.Speaking of ships, according to a 2009 report by The Guardian, in one year a single large container ship can emit pollution equivalent to that generated by 50 MILLION cars.Health risks of shipping pollution have been 'underestimated'The civilian shipping industry burns anywhere from 250 million to 300 million TONS of bunker fuel per year to accommodate the needs of our global economy. Bunker fuel is 1,000 times dirtier than highway diesel used in automobiles. Because of this, the shipping industry generates between 10 and 30 percent of global atmospheric pollution depending on how you calculate the numbers. Replacing even 10% of those ships with fusion powered nuclear ships would not only save billions in annual fuel expenditures for shipping companies but it would reduce the pollution output of the industry by tens of thousands of tons of carbon per year. I’d call that world changing.3.) Fusion Doesn’t Mean FreeCOUNTERPOINT:No one ever said power has to be ‘free’ to ‘change the world.’ What we’re talking about here is a  clean, safe, abundant energy source. What we pay for that will be worked out by the economics. In other words, that ‘problem’ if you want to call it that - will sort itself out as fusion finds its footing in a rapidly diversifying energy infrastructure. It will have to eventually compete with solar and wind and consumers will have a choice of where their power comes from and how much they pay for it will be determined by the marketplace.","3,658 followers",Brent Oster,3.6K,357,1.8M,2015,https://www.quora.com/If-we-were-able-to-successfully-harvest-helium-3-from-the-Moon-would-fusion-power-become-viable

Earth-shattering. </sarcasm>I'll start giving a crap when someone figures out a way to bypass the steam turbine and produce electrical energy directly from a nuclear reaction. But good luck with that -- again, the fundamental physical laws don't support the premise.Fusion Doesn't Mean FuelFor at least the next 30 years, liquid hydrocarbon fuels will be necessary for the majority of passenger automobile travel, and the entirety of air travel and heavy cargo shipping. It's simply an energy density issue -- galvanic cell batteriesElectricity cost barely impacts this -- liquid hydrocarbons are just outright superior to batteries for transport applications. Energy density is king. It's more about physics than economics.And without such a massive global shift to electric cars, electricity generation really doesn't impact the oil/gas industry. That means fusion power is completely irrelevant to half the world's primary energy production.Fusion Doesn't Mean FreeFirst off, any sane company would charge only slightly less for fusion power than we currently pay for existing electricity sources. It's simple profit motive -- you charge the most you can while still capturing market share. But even if by sheer philanthropy theElectricity will never be zero-cost.And that would be a lovely price to pay for electricity,Consider the golden days of nuclear fission plant construction. Pro-nuclear activists claimed the power would be ""too cheap to meter"" and they weren't too far off. Power from an early nuclear plant -- before activist opposition and post-Chernobyl safety precautions increased costs -- was only about $0.02-0.04/kWh, adjusted for inflation. The US started a massive reactor construction program that churned out power plants fast enough to transform the face of US energy production. It dwarfed the scale of today's renewables growth. And did the world change? I would say there was a resounding ""Don't get me wrong, cheaper energy is awesome. If electricity becomes free at the point of generation but still costs money to transmit, lots of thingsAvailabilityIt pains me to admit it, but many studies show minimal long-term impact on developed nations from higher energy costs. Studies vary on this subject but the point is, the effect isn't enormous. In modern service-oriented economies, high energy costs primarily manifest as a negative impact on the inflation rate and growth rate. Again, cheaper energy is awesome, but it isn't world-changing. TAnd there would be some waste, too. People would set their thermostats lower in summer. People would buy electric heaters instead of high-efficiency heat pumps. More lights would stay on when no one's in the room. Electric kettles would be left on all day to keep the water hot for tea. You can see this behavior today in countries that heavily subsidize energy. It's arguable whether that's a good thing.And don't even get meIn fact, it's one of the most unnatural and expensive substances on the planet -- running around $30,000/gram with a global usage rate under 400 grams per year.

Those plants are already under fire for heavy pollution and CO2 emissions, so I would bet that as soon as a proven viable alternative exists that can go anywhere a coal plant currently is, that does the same job without any CO2 emissions, the regional generators will jump to replace their coal plants and get out from under the ""cap and trade"". Coal might continue to be worth producing for a decade or so during the transition and for export to developing nations that will have to wait for the technology to become more mainstream, but a working proof-of-concept fusion plant will be coal's final death knell.Petroleum producers and refiners will probably fare much better for the medium term; gasoline and diesel aren't going anywhere without significant improvements in either electrolytic charge storage capacity or portable high-efficiency fuel cell technology.  Transportation usage alone makes up 68% of petroleum consumption in the United States. A further 25% is used industrially, and it's unclear what the divide is between use of the petroleum chemicals themselves for polymer production (which fusion power wouldn't replace), and burning the stuff for heat such as in metal refining/recycling (grid power can be used for this kind of work, but large changes in existing petroleum-fired smelters would be needed). About 5.8% is used for residential and commercial heating/cooking needs, where a significant investment would be needed for a switchover to all-electric (and loss of gas cooktops would be resisted by foodies), while only 1.4% of U.S. petroleum consumption is for grid electricity.However, with grid power becoming insanely cheap over a few decades, the industrial sector would likely take steps to reduce petroleum consumption for industrial heating, and even if industrial use were cut by half and all other sources remained the same, we'd likely see a price collapse in petroleum as demand from the biggest bulk consumers would disappear rapidly. That will lead to abandonment of the lowest-margin oil production projects, like the tar sands, as the price decline makes those unprofitable. That will cost jobs in the short term during a transition from petroleum production to fusion fuel production (building and running water electrolysis plants, mostly).Something tells me that production of the fuel used by the plant, probably hydrogen isotopes, is not considered into the energy costs of the plant. We could use renewables, like solar and wind, to run hydrogen production plants. That could lead to increased development of renewable sources, but depending on the margins of energy consumption to production that this new plant could provide, the plant might do better than breakeven even if it were electrolyzing its own fuel. If that's the case, we'll likely abandon all other forms of energy production including renewables, which will cost R&D and construction jobs in those sectors.In summary, the biggest losers will be those who are unable to adapt to change, as has always been the case. The typewriter replaced dozens of hand copyists requiring perfect penmanship with a couple dozen typists able to produce a completely legible document in a fraction of the time of hand copying. So, if you wanted to stay employed, you learned to type. The photostatic copier (Xerox machine) in turn replaced the typing pool with just one or two secretaries, so if you wanted to stay employed, you had to find something else to do where your typing skills were valued for something beyond rote copying of documents.",0 followers,Brent Cooper,611,7.9K,410.1M,2014,https://www.quora.com/How-electricity-is-produced-in-a-nuclear-power-plant

14,"Ryan Carlyle's answer is spot onFusion is a very exciting process but is not the ultimate solution to energy that everyone seems to think it is.The biggest reason why is that the size of the supporting power plant does not change just because the core process does. The same methods still apply for getting the energy from the nuclear core to the electrical grid. You still need excessive amounts of water to move the heat, huge pumps to move the water, boilers to generate steam, and steam turbines to drive the generator.Ryan Carlyle's answer is spot onFusion is a very exciting process but is not the ultimate solution to energy that everyone seems to think it is.The biggest reason why is that the size of the supporting power plant does not change just because the core process does.

So there are shielding and containment concerns the same as there are in today's fission plants. The main benefit here is that the half life of tritium is only about 12 years and the product of the reaction is helium so there wouldn't be a problem with spent fuel storage like there is with fission products.Getting to the issue of tritium, not only is it a very rare isotope of hydrogen, it is also a key ingredient in thermonuclear weapons. So you can bet your ass that they won't be dishing it out like candy on Halloween. Also the main source of tritium is fission plants so we won't be running out of those anytime soon.So long story short,We're still a long way from Stark's arc reactor....but I can dream can't I?",2 followers,Richard Muller,1.7K,2.3K,202.4M,2014,https://www.quora.com/If-Lockheeds-recent-announcement-on-nuclear-fusion-energy-is-true-how-will-it-change-the-world-What-countries-and-companies-would-benefit-or-lose-the-most

Nuclear fission can provide both.  How to make electricity with reactors is well known, so I'll concentrate on propulsion.Short answer:Long answer:The rocket equation tells usWhat exhaust velocity is fission capable of?  The nuclear-thermal rockets mentioned above all use heat from a reactor to accelerate a gas propellant.  Naturally, the heavier the propellant, the slower it will exit the rocket when heated by a given amount.  Hence, lightweight hydrogen gas is often chosen.But the revolutionary dusty plasma reactor of Sheldon & ClarkThoriumTo burn thorium directly we need to use fast neutrons.  It should be possible to run a nuclear-thermal rocket on fast neutrons (though we might need to swap the hydrogen propellant for helium, since the former gas is a neutron moderator).  The dusty plasma reactor is generally assumed to run on slow neutrons, since then the plasma can be made much smaller.  To burn thorium with slow neutrons we first need to transmute (""breed"") it into uranium-233.  While breeding nuclear fuel in flight would certainly complicate engine design, it may turn out to be feasible.It is certainly the case that, if weAside: What about Fusion?The only fusion reaction that releases charged products more energetically than fission is D-He3 (about 13% light speed).  He3 doesn't occur on Earth, so it would have to be bred in flight.  And the D-He3 reaction is very hard to achieve.So fusion has some promise, but unlike fission-powered rockets, we don't yet have the technology to make it work.* Assuming 100% engine efficiency, a one-way fission-powered trip on the ISS to Proxima Centauri would take ~ 40 years and require 25kt U-235.
