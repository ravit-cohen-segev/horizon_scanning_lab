Extrinsic:Everything that influences your decision and opinion is stored here (ex: why do you like certain music, food or fashion)The interesting part is this motivation usually does not last more than 3–6 months.3. Obsessions:This stores your passions but also your addictions such as being a workaholic, drugs, shopaholic and chasing stuff.When it’s on, you are not free to choose what you want anymore and will go after the obsession.# Imagination:This is the marvel of evolution, it’s what makes us human.Your imagination driver gives you creativity and adaptation.It should take control when dealing with new and complex situations that require you to think out of the box.People usually don’t let imagination driver take control and stick to their motivation driver instead, which leads them to lose out on big innovations.Examples:These mistakes happened because the people in charge relied on their motivation driver which only thinks from what it already knows - if they had used their imagination driver, they can see a future that Steve Jobs saw.When your imagination driver is taking control, you feel calm and in full control.How to activate it on command? think for yourself these questions:Making yourself answer these questions in your head activates the imagination driver.In conclusion we can say that even though our brain is too complex to summarise in a Quora post, this framework gives us a better idea on how we go about our daily lives and how we can use this knowledge to live a better life.Hope this helps you as much as it helped me.I might be updating this post with more findings, follow it if you want to keep updated.All the best!","220,631 followers",Franklin Veaux,1.8K,47.3K,783M,2017,https://www.quora.com/Is-technology-growing-and-getting-faster-exponentially-How-does-this-affect-our-slowly-evolving-human-mind

A big brain is a HUGE investment for animals, not only does it not immediately benefit you, you still would suffer from other immediate hazards (such as mauled to death by a lion). However, a large brain benefits the specie in the long run. Homo sapiens may be crap at surviving but we can boost our chances of survival by using our brain.We can’t kill sh!t using our bare hands so our ancestors got rocks, then clubs, then spears, then bows. You can clearly see how the human race “evolved” without changing much, we just got better at using our precious brain.Raw food often made people sick so our ancestors used fire. Fire can cook and deter wild animals / mosquitos.Humans often lived together since a lone human was a dead human. We needed others to watch our backs as we rested or cared for our children. We also had “dens” and small houses since sleeping in the open was pretty much a death sentence and a free meal for predators.Our way of “evolution” is far superior than that of other animals. It takes hundreds of years to evolve as an animal, giraffes didn’t get their long necks over night. It takes less time for a pack of humans to invent and create tools and “technology” that can really increase our chance of survival.And the most important part of our “evolution” is that it is exponential. The more advanced we got the faster we advanced in technology. More advanced technology = less deaths and more efficient survival.A huge step in the advancement of our specie is when we went from hunter gatherers to farmers. No longer did we have to move around and hunt for food. We stood our ground, built houses, farmed, bred, and finally got a permanent area we call home. Also farming drastically increased the amount of food we had.After that, the rest is history.",11 followers,David Emmanuel,1.9K,0,0,2018,https://www.quora.com/Have-we-as-humans-evolved-or-does-the-technology-just-make-us-better-as-a-race

Scalability, if you use Amazon and other cloud services for both computing cycles and storage becomes almost a non-issue [Note to tech types: I'm naive, I know]4. Similarly, internationalization (albeit restricted to one of the major global languages, even then, you can do low-cost multi-languaging, including crowdsourcing your translations) is virtually built in; it's only where there are regulatory differences (e.g. sweepstakes laws) are you really restricted from expanding to other other countries.Great examples include the Aussie startups that created: 99designs, ThemeForest; Flippa; RetailMeNot; and the list goes on ... and are still operating from Australia, yet their largest market is the USA.Conversely to get my bricks'n'mortar business off the ground then expand to just three countries: USA, Australia, New Zealand nearly killed me.So, if I was going to have a shot at answering the ""how"" of your question, I would say ""In three stages: 1.

So developing lactase persistance botAny tool use is technology.Dairying, the routine keeping of mammals for milk production, is a historically important technology. And in cultures where dairying was developed, we generally see the evolution of lactase persistance — the generation of the enzyme to digest milk sugar long after typical weaning.The opposite, wild-type condition is lactose intolerance. It can be quite unpleasant, because if you don’t digest milk sugar there are bacteria in your gut which will be quite happy to do so — with the concomitant production of copious quantities of gas. So developing lactase persistance both enabled obtaining energy from milk and prevented the debilitating issues which occur if the lactose isn’t digested.","5,990 followers",Jens Böttiger,566,2.6K,17.6M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Is-technology-growing-and-getting-faster-exponentially-How-does-this-affect-our-slowly-evolving-human-mind
