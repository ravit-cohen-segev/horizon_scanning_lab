0,"1 million dollars, or the equivalency of local currency.You need to spend money, because others around you also need to be paid to stay alive. This number almost never changes.Jeff Bezos parents gave him 245000 dollars when he started.Starbuck’s Howard Schultz asked for 400,000 dollars to get started.Technology is global, so we use global price. The number one and only reason a company fail is running out of money. In gamer language, you can not re-spawn anymore.Let’s say you hire 5 engineering people, and try to build a little hardware.

1,"I learned this years ago from a Flight Attendant who literally sat in the back of a plane near me and chatted it up, and I thought we were flirting, only for her to tell me she had a boyfriend at the end of the flight.She was a tease or I was a guy misreading the signs. Probably the latter :):|When these masks drop down.They aren’t actually connected to oxygen tanks.Those masks have a tube of chemicals connected to them. They refer to them as “oxygen candles” that burn for about 15 minutes and provide you a source of oxygen.Also - these people in the picture are wearing the masks wrong.

2,"There are basically two ways to destroy a satellite:1. Launch a bomb into the same orbit as the target, sidle up to it and blow up. This is the orbital method.2. Lob something directly into its path. This is the suborbital approach.For targets in low earth orbit #2 can use a much smaller rocket than #1 because the interceptor doesn't actually have to achieve orbit. It takes relatively little energy just to reach low orbital altitude;There are basically two ways to destroy a satellite:1.

This is the suborbital approach.For targets in low earth orbit #2 can use a much smaller rocket than #1 because the interceptor doesn't actually have to achieve orbit. It takes relatively little energy just to reach low orbital altitude;The earliest anti-satellite (ASAT) tests decades ago by the Soviet Union used method #1 despite the big rockets required because they didn't have small, fast computers and good targeting sensors.  The American tests, and the more recent tests by other countries (e.g., China) have used #2.The fact that it's now much easier to destroy a satellite than to launch one should give every spacefaring country great pause. So should the fact that ASAT tests have created huge amounts of long-lived orbital debris that presents a hazard to other satellites. Thousands of objects from the Soviet and Chinese tests are still in orbit. The US was somewhat more responsible, shooting down only satellites that would soon decay anyway. However, our ASAT tests still goad our adversaries into further developing and testing their own weapons, and that's not a good thing for a country like ours that depends more on satellites than anyone else. In my opinion, the sooner we get a global treaty banning ASATs, the better.","5,360 followers",Valerio Cietto,677,2.4K,9.1M,2015,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-best-resource-for-emerging-satellite-technology
3,"Wealth countries have formed alliances and this alliances are meant to stop any emerging economy from rising and joining their club. Do you see what is happening to China’s Huawei and Japan's Toshiba? That shows you how far this country would go to prevent any country from rising economically.If you are an emerging economy, you have to reinvent the wheel and form alliances with other emerging economies so that you can have a strong negotiating power on the international scale, otherwise, you stand no chance.

4,"Politics is important. There is a reason that I’m in Hong Kong. I have closer connections with Taiwan than I do in Hong Kong, and it’s only after trying and failing to do things in Taiwan that I ended up in HK.The big difference between Taiwan and South Korea is that South Korea has a few large companies which work very closely with the government, and a lot of the government is run by non-political bureaucrats which means that stuff still happens when people are screaming about the President.In Taiwan, the companies are much smaller which means that they don’t have the extra money to spend onPolitics is important.

Also it’s far, far harder to have government coordinate things because there isn’t a “neutral” political bureaucracy. Because the officials are strongly associated with the government in power, it’s really difficult to work with the government if the other party is in power.In Shenzhen/Hong Kong, the people with money and the people with tech talk with each other. You can show up fresh off the boat in Hong Kong and start meeting with people that will fund your project. If you don’t know who to talk to, then talk to me, and I’ll get you set up with people and point you to people that will help you. Taiwan has never had this sort of linkage.As far as a tech hub like Shenzhen and SV, it’s not going to happen, because Taiwan is not Shenzhen and Silicon Valley. You have to create something different. Taiwan is can be very strong in agriculture, tourism, and biotech. It’s also got a huge potential in fintech and blockchain. Also the fact that costs are lower make Taiwan really good for back office IT.The model for Taiwan that I’m seeing is less Shenzhen and SV then Estonia. But for any of this to happen, the Taiwan government has to just say the words “92 consensus” or “one China, different interpretations.” The reality of the situation is that unless and until Taiwan comes up with some framework with the Mainland, nothing is going to happen.",823 followers,Neel Kumar,539,5.5K,16.7M,2019,https://www.quora.com/How-much-will-it-cost-to-start-an-emerging-technologies-company-Is-it-possible
5,"Taiwan and Korea's tech strategy are very difference since the 1970s. The bulk of Taiwanese tech companies are small businesses and the largest are mid-sized on the global scale.Korea's strategy was to focus its effort on building mega-big-businesses like Samsung and Hyundai. You need the political power to support many mergers to grow a mega-big company like that (which Taiwanese constantly refuse to do)Taiwanese argument is if their economy were built mainly by small/mid-size businesses, it can be more flexible and adaptive and the economy will survive better in the long run... and Korean'sTaiwan and Korea's tech strategy are very difference since the 1970s.

6,"There is a lot of misconceptions and confusion among students when it comes to choosing B.Sc. or B.Tech. after 12th.A common misconception is B.Tech. (engineering) is better than B.Sc. (pure science), while a few confident students stick to B.Sc. as their career goals are clear. Some feel B.Tech. is tough and they won’t be able to perform up to the expected level, while others feel B.Sc. is way too easy.To remove this confusion and misconceptions, we look a the different aspects, scope, difficulty level, career prospects, etc., involved in these two courses and maybe help you in choosing eitheThere is a lot of misconceptions and confusion among students when it comes to choosing B.Sc. or B.Tech. after 12th.A common misconception is B.Tech.
