But they would have an abundance of material on Earth, especially of carbon, which would likely be the building blocks of such an assemblers. If you were carrying a jar of them and tripped and they spilled out, and they had no limit, they would quickly devour the entire earth with no way of stopping them.But here is where things get interesting: These tiny robots would have the ability to construct molecules from atoms, giving them the ability to produce amazing materials like graphene, cubes of apple, and even brain material.With advanced nanotechnology in the form of self-replicators, the entire world would experience a revolution. Think for a second about what wouldn’t change in the face of machines that can produceProduction jobs would cease. The price of every item ever created would be lowered massively. Supercomputers and experiments regarding brain material would become almost commonplace. Terraforming other planets would take years if not months.

From the machine that makes the bottle you used to nibble on as a toddler to the rocket that propels the satellites into space. From the cycle that your first rode on the street to the plane that you have or may fly to take you miles away to escape the world. From the paddle wheel mechanism used in farms for watering to the deep rigging tools used in oil fields under water. From the air-conditioning in a normal office to the cryogenic storage of highly combustible gases.Mechanical engineering has always been considered to be the mother of engineering (and civil engineering -the father, with all due respect to my fellas in the field) and so will this field of engineering exist at the core of any system, as it has existed in the past.Personally, I graduated as a mechanical engineer, was hired by huge software company to support their domain related to manufacturing industry, then shifted to planning for an aluminium refinery, only to try my hands in designing equioments for refineries ending up doing civil and structural design for these equipments.

I am not here to give any negative comments about these exams in any exam hard work and sincerity is required but there should be some  law and order for selective procedures in PSU's .If we talk about 10 yrs back then also Mechanical Engineers got graduated but they were not facing certain problems like now because various PSU's would take individual exams and at that time also GATE was there but it's meant to be for those student who wants to do M.Tech.What's the reason to merge all the PSU's with this GATE exam and the most funny part is we can appear in this exam once in a year only and if you got somehow selected also to get in a PSU's will be like dream because as you know in India reservation policy is there the general candidates gets screwed every where.That's the reason why many core engineers from India move to different countries for gaining knowledge and finally relocates there only but what about the middle class family and poor family how they can manage if they want to get employed in there field so 90% engineers fill bank post for PO,Clerk,Peon and if they get selected they happily join because at a certain point money matters. I am not saying joining bank is bad but engineering field is a different field it's focus on developing,designing,production and various technical tasks which we want to do but no every doors are closed for us if we want our interest to implement. Basically I don't know how many of you have faced this situation but many times when I went to certain companies for meeting the HR for just consulting about vacancy believe me the security guards in various companies initially ask me whom to meet if I say HR the security will reply sorry you cannot meet him get out. HR thinks we are some kind of disease if they will meet us he/she will fall ill. Also there are many critics who says that in media basically from AICTC that we lack skills therefore we are not getting employed.I want to ask them how many of you know about engineering and if you think we don't have skill then it's government duty to do something because your council only give affiliation to our degree.As a Mechanical Engineer I request to all core engineers who are not getting good job opportunities and also freshers who are looking for job write n no. of letters to our beloved PM and make him realize that what is condition of unemployed engineers and tell him to concentrate on core field also not only on IT field.

Being a mechanical engineer does not mean that I am competent in HVAC design or aircraft design. It also does not mean that I am incompetent in Electrical systems design. Once you have an engineering degree, all you have proven is that you can learn technical subjects quickly. The real learning starts on your first day of work. Some of our best process (chemical) engineers are mechanical engineers because they have an excellent grasp of thermodynamics, fluids, heat transfer etc… Similarly, I have seen some very good structural engineers (typically civil) that had mechanical engineering degrees. Mechanical engineers make great controls engineers as they understand the mechanical and process aspects of the system and we also learn most aspects of electrical circuits. Many of our best “programmers” are mechanical engineers where you would have expected a computer or electrical engineer. I used to design building systems and was forced to learn about building codes, mechanical systems and electrical systems. I was equally comfortable specifying beams as I was specifying high voltage feeders or plumbing waste stacks.  Having hired many different engineers over my career, I have learned that mechanical engineers are generally the most well rounded and can do just about anything with suitable training and mentorship. I personally think that we should only have one engineering degree and that it should be based on mechanical engineering. Once you graduate and follow a certain path, then you can take more specialized course for a particular field. I have also hired many technologists who generally get more specialized training in one field; however, I find their ability to expand beyond their base is limited. Sure they know the new lingo and hit the ground running but they stall pretty quick once the technology or conditions change. Young engineers are generally more broad but can quickly grasp the lingo and concepts.Another very important aspect is that engineering is a self-regulated profession. As a profession, we are held to very high standards. After university, we only get two grades. The bridge either stands up or it falls down. The plane either flies or it crashes. If we screw up, people can die. We are not allowed to make mistakes. How is it possible that anyone can get 100% every time. It is very simple, we use proven codes, standards and methods. We use checkers and stringent approval processes. We are registered with the government and take an oath to protect the public and put them above all else. When we stamp a drawing, we are saying that people can bet their lives on our work. We are expected to know and follow the applicable codes and if we deviate from them, we better be able to defend it in court. When you read a code - for example NFPA 85 code for boilers, - it makes reference to every discipline of engineering from civil to mechanical to electrical and controls. We are expected to fully comprehend and translate the requirements into specifications that can be relied upon for the construction of a system that is safe, reliable and cost effective. So in essence, engineers are also technical lawyers. Our job is to understand technical requirements embodied in codes and standards and protect the public. We are held to very high ethical standards. This often brings conflict and forces us to ponder philosophy. Is it ethical for an engineer to develop weapons that could be used to kill children. Is it ethical for an engineer to design machines that contribute to global warming. We are faced with these questions every day.In many ways mechanical engineers are the engine of society. We create and build the systems that everyone relies upon. If someone asks where power comes from and their initial thoughts are the electrical outlet, then we smile and think about all the massive infrastructure that was created by engineers to support power getting to the outlet.Being a mechanical engineer can be very fulfilling. Indirectly you touch many lives and solve problems that benefit society. I am not suggesting mechanical engineering is altruistic but there is definitely an element of philosophy embodied in our profession.I started university at 16 with extreme naivety and just took mechanical engineering because I liked cars. I now look back on my life and career and feel extremely fortunate and truly believe I could not have picked a better profession.So the short answer to what is mechanical engineering is that it can be whatever you want. You are given a toolbox of knowledge that lets you do anything or go anywhere that your heart desires. How you use the tools is up to you.","8,709 followers",Mukunda Madhava Nath,689,543,3M,2016,https://www.quora.com/What-futuristic-upcoming-technologies-should-a-mechanical-engineer-know-which-will-lead-to-great-demand-in-India

Intelligence by itself is not a danger, it has no project, it reasons to solve problems. It is waiting for orders. Ego gives orders ! It wants a territory, food, a sexual partner, children, the power in order to have and keep all that with the minimum of effort. It dictates to the intelligence the problems to be solved. That leads it to accept the fight.We must also be aware that, to be useful, these robots will not be android. We will give them forms adapted to their function. For example, if they have to move around no need to develop complex mechanisms to make them walk in balance on 2 feet while we master perfectly the 4-wheel technology, much more stable and fast. This will give robots that will not encroach on our territory because they will be specialized. Exactly as the plane does not copy the bird but is specialized in ultra-fast intercontinental transport of passengers and goods.To reassure you and you forget the fantasies of Kurzweil, let's imagine that one very, very, very distant day we will have created stupidly, without having foreseen safeguards, an intelligent robot wanting to fight with us.

That computer will build a better computer, which will build a better computer, which will build a better computer, over and over, faster than a human can think. Soon, a computer will be created that is so ridiculously intelligent, we’ll seem no smarter than ants to it. So, humans trying to guess what that computer will do, or if it will do anything, is like a cat trying to guess which nations will go to war in the next decade.Now, that doesn’t mean we haven’t tried.

Maybe they become sentimental and preserve Earth for historical reasons. Maybe they advance brain/computer interface technology so we can connect to each other.

Since labor-time is itself scarce (no one has the time to do all the work required to procure all the goods they might want), it was most optimal to divide labor into different types to be done by different people. Division of labor made trade more favorable  (the Law of Comparative Advantage), and when trade networks were regulated and secured by protections against fraud (standard weights and measures and standardized currencies), the result was the enormous proliferation of goods and wealth.However, advanced information technology seems to contain a possibility that subverts the foundation of classical economics. Everyone knows about Moore's Law, the exponential increase in processing power over time, as well as the radical (monetary) devaluation of processing power. An amount of computing power that cost millions to implement in the 1950s is now a tiny, tiny fraction of the computing power of your $400 netbook.But what's significant is not the advances in computing power, but rather the way in which previously valuable (i.e., scarce) forms of content -text, graphics, sound recordings, moving images- have been seized by computing and multiplied as freely copyable data.Goods are only priceable if they're scarce. In the age of high-powered computing, information is not scarce but wildly abundant. This obviously creates a huge economic problem (for the music and newspaper industries, and for many more sectors in the near future.)The real freakout will happen when material goods can be reproduced by information technology: hence, Kurzweil looks to nanomanufacturing (see 3D printing and the RepRap) and sees the end of the world as we know it.It is the creeping, inexorable, and very real transition from a resource-scarce economy to a data-abundant economy that I think gives rise to fantastic Singularitarian dreams.","66,035 followers",Niklas Göke,3.6K,235,32.2M,2010,https://www.quora.com/What-do-you-think-will-be-an-upcoming-technology-to-invest-our-skills-in
