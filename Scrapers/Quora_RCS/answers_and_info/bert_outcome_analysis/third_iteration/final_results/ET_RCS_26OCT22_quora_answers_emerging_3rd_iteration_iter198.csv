Everyone has some familiarity with it. Soda comes in 1L and 2L bottles, medication is dosed in ML and MG, our cars show both MPH and km/h.

2,"The US is the most technologically advanced nation there ever was, so obviously not! I had the privilege of living there for 4 years in the 90s.

She turned to me and said, “Do you have washing machines in Scotland?” Obviously, I was forced to admit, that no we didn’t. Instead we just went down to the river and bashed our clothes off rocks to clean them.2) Transport - I spent two weeks in the lovely town of Columbia. Missouri. There I amazed the locals with my insistence on using a strange outmoded form of transport known as “walking”. Locals would slow down as they passed in their modern cars, pointing and laughing. To them, it must have been like watching a live action version of the Flintstones.3) Voting – would you believe it, but in the UK we still vote by drawing a little X next to the candidate we want to vote for. No sign of the advanced electronic voting they have over in the states. Indeed, we are so old fashioned that we haven’t even outsourced our voting to the Russians yet!4) Guns – It may be hard for an American to believe but almost nobody in the UK owns their own guns. This means that if we have to rise up and overthrow our own government (currently seems like a good plan) then we will be armed with nothing more than some particularly well sharpened sarcasm.Still, perhaps one day we can hope to be as advanced as the US.

In other words, the Chinese government needs to help college graduates equivalent to the entire French population find jobs every six years. Don't forget that in addition to full-time university graduates, there are many people who have obtained college diplomas through part-time studies.The Chinese government’s attitude is clear: companies need to create jobs to absorb so many highly educated graduates. It is precisely because of the difficulty of employment that China has no way to promote the mechanization of agriculture-this will mean that about 600 million laborers will be released from the land, equivalent to the entire population of the United States.The Chinese government needs technology companies to create jobs, and try to attract as many people as possible to find employment.

Advanced technology could be medical breakthroughs, economical breakthroughs, and nearly anything in between.Aren’t group chats and ride sharing apps also technology? And don’t apps like these generate Chinese income? I would say advanced technology is a good thing if proper ethical standards are in place. Technology is amoral but tech creators are not.So there should be regulations, and even US tech giants like Bill Gates agree the industry needs some regulation. But what should these regulations be and who should issue and enforce them is my concern…and likely China’s concern.Take an app for example. Let’s say a new company in China launches something that is greater than WeChat, Facebook, PayPal, and Alipay combined. It blows up over night and makes tons of money in China. The company wants to branch out internationally. The company stores chat conversations and banking information for users in its servers.Now, say they export this app to the international community and people in the US use it. It becomes wildly popular in the US. Let’s say Chinese government officials have social media accounts on the app. We know from Eric Snowden’s leaks that the US spies on communication in the international community. So say the NSA starts monitoring Chinese officials through their social media? No clear regulations in place so it’s a free for all.But let’s say China places regulations on the tech industry so that it’s harder for foreign governments to gain Chinese information. What are those regulations? How far should they go? I don’t know, but balancing privacy and allowing the tech industry to grow and expand is a concern.How big is too big for a company to become? How much information is too much information? How much financial risk is okay and when should we say that’s enough? Will regulations cause the tech industry to stagnate? I don’t know, but these and other questions should be considered. Is Xi right this time? I can’t say.","36,844 followers",Sylvain Saurel,1.4K,6.2K,265.9M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Why-does-an-advanced-technological-country-such-as-the-US-still-use-antiquated-units-of-measurement-like-Farenheit-feet-yards-gallons-pints-and-so-on

In Chinese, it’s summarized as “Every piece of rice in one’s bowl is from the wok.” You are not allowed to tell them that every piece of rice in the wok is put in by individuals. So, pursuing the greatness of a state is everything for a man to live under their communist/materialistic view.In Xi’s concept of advanced technology, he separates those that he thinks could make the state strong from that he thinks couldn’t. It’s not different from Mao’s idea that he once said the high education of liberal arts was not needed, the course of Chinese revolution only needed the education of science and engineering and biology and so on.Nothing is new here.

Trump's use of social media brought greater chaos and divisions in American society leading to some apps being banned and himself banned from some.Xi's views, that ""national greatness doesn't depend on....... probably focused on achievements, recognition and honors. The insight is wisely formulated if you watch the video bellow and should be the endgame.China's population is 4 times that of the US but how many Nobel prize laureates are there from China? America still hosts many of the best universities and colleges in the world.Viewed from another perspective, you need to read this report an extract as follow....According to a widely cited study by PricewaterhouseCoopers, the U.S. and China are set to capture 70% of the $15.7 trillion windfall that AI is expected to add to the global economy by 2030.(Does Xi know something we don't?)Another area of U.S.-China interdependence has been knowledge production.With the rise of Chinese talent and capital, the exchange of technological know-how between the United States and China now takes place among private businesses and between individuals.” Leading technology companies in both countries have been building research centers in the other. Alibaba, Baidu, and Tencent have all opened research centers in the United States, just as Apple, Microsoft, Tesla, and other major American technology companies rely upon engineering talent in China.In science collaboration, following the global spread of COVID-19, American and Chinese experts collaborated more during the past year than over the previous five years combined. This has led to over 100 co-authored articles in leading scientific journals and frequent joint appearances in science-focused workshops and webinars. Trying to curtail all trade with China would be too costly. And even if breaking apart economic interdependence were possible, we cannot decouple the ecological interdependence that obeys the laws of biology and physics, not politics.”The dense webs formed by trade, financial, scientific, and academic links between the United States and China will make it difficult for one side to inflict harm on the other without hurting itself in the processU.S.-China relations are going to be hard-nosed and tense. Neither side is likely to offer concessions in service of smoother relations. At the same time, the balance of interests on both sides likely will control hostile impulses, placing the relationship in a state of hardening competition that coexists alongside a mutual awareness that both sides will be impacted — for good or ill — by their capacity to address common challenges.","68,796 followers",Kanthaswamy Balasubramaniam,898,17.3K,413.6M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Why-does-an-advanced-technological-country-such-as-the-US-still-use-antiquated-units-of-measurement-like-Farenheit-feet-yards-gallons-pints-and-so-on
