Continuous operation of a fusion power plant is maintained by continual refuelling with the fuel mixture (deuterium-tritium or deuterium-deuterium), so the fuel inventory in the plasma chamber at any time is gram quantity or less and sufficient only for about one minute of operation. The ITER tokamak will contain only grams of fusion fuel as it runs. A NIF laser fusion capsule contains only about 0.17 milligrams of Deuterium-Tritium fuel-No greenhouse gasses produced-No reactor core meltdowns and no fission product decay heat burn downs (Chernboyl, Three Mile Island, Fukushima incidents cannot happen)-No mining of fuel is required for several forms of fusion as deuterium fuel is extracted directly from water. For first generation deuterium-tritium fusion; lithium must be mined and then exposed to a source of neutrons to form tritium fuel. Second generation fusion fuels like pure deuterium is totally nonradioactive and can be obtained from sea water without resorting to surface mining.-Billions of years of fuel available on earth (versus a few thousand years for uranium based fission and a few hundreds of years for fossil fuels)-1/1000ths of the radioactive waste of fission power (typical nuclear power). Nearly all materials become activated to some degree by energetic neutron bombardment. Neutron reactions in DT fusion reactors will inevitably create radioisotopes. The principal radioactive materials present in a DT or DD fusion reactor will therefore be tritium and neutron activated structural materials surrounding the reaction volume.-Radioactive waste remains radioactive ~20 years versus hundreds of thousands. DT fusion reactors would burn and require storage of significant quantities of tritium, a moderately radioactive nuclear isotope of hydrogen. Tritium gas is hard to secure and small leaks in reactor tanks and plumbing could result in some loss of tritium to the environment. Tritium decays while emitting weak Beta radiation and under most circumstances is not highly hazardous to humans. The deuterium-deuterium (DD) fusion process, dispensing with tritium as a fuel and the requirement for Tritium storage. DD fusion does however produce Tritium as part of the DD fusion reaction, but this Tritium does not tend to accumulate but is immediately burned in place inside a DD fusion reactor.-Fuel for energy would no longer be a geopolitical issue (huge benefit for humanity)-No nuclear weapons from waste products (again, huge benefit for humanity)","105,674 followers",Dave Consiglio,4.5K,6.8K,91.6M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Whats-the-safest-way-to-make-energy

2,"A fusion reaction, any exergonic fusion reaction releases a great deal of energy. The release of energy inevitably heats the material in which the reactions occur, and under ordinary circumstances this causes the material to expand. Fusion reaction rates are rapidly increasing with temperature at temperatures below the Coulomb barrier, but they also are rapidly decreasing with density.So the conditions for a runaway fusion reaction to occur are fairly delicately balanced by these factors.To produce a runaway reaction the fusion fuel must be at high enough density, it must be at high enough temA fusion reaction, any exergonic fusion reaction releases a great deal of energy. The release of energy inevitably heats the material in which the reactions occur, and under ordinary circumstances this causes the material to expand. Fusion reaction rates are rapidly increasing with temperature at temperatures below the Coulomb barrier, but they also are rapidly decreasing with density.So the conditions for a runaway fusion reaction to occur are fairly delicately balanced by these factors.To produce a runaway reaction the fusion fuel must be at high enough density, it must be at high enough temperature, and it must be kept in place for long enough.In nature such a thing only happens when gravitational forces become large enough that the density of matter is so high that electron degeneracy pressure supports the matter, as happens in white dwarf stars. This is a fantastically high density, not easy to conceive of even.In such a case the reaction rate can indeed grow more quickly than the highly condensed and gravitationally bound matter can escape. This results in the helium flash in dwarf stars like the Sun, and it also is believed with quite good evidence to result in type Ia supernovae by another mechanism than the helium flash. The helium flash does not destroy a star like the Sun, but it does lift the whole core out of electron degeneracy against its own gravity. In a white dwarf that undergoes a type Ia supernova the star is completely disrupted. The energy release is very large in such a runaway reaction.But such conditions are not possible to replicate on Earth, and thankfully so.Instead all designs for fusion reactors operate in regimes of far smaller density than exists in the core of the Sun even, where a runaway reaction is prevented because of the hydrodynamic factors that I mentioned above. Generally they operate at far higher temperatures and lower densities than exist in the core of the Sun, whatever the means is that is employed to confine the fusing plasma fuel, and the extreme heat leads to instabilities that attempt very, very hard to reduce the density of the plasma, and so turn the fusion reaction off long before it has time to run away in the sense you may mean. This is true of all of the magnetic confinement designs. That is in fact the major difficulty, keeping the hot and fairly dilute plasma from simply expanding and hitting the walls of the reactor vessel.The exception, and the only known viable artificial exception to this on Earth is inertial confinement of a very high temperature plasma, maybe ten times the temperature at the core of the Sun -this plasma is created by using a large part of the energy of a small fission weapon to produce an extremely efficient compression and heating (there is more to it than this of course) of some macroscopic amount of fusion fuel, typically lithium deuteride is used. This of course is a thermonuclear weapon, and it is dependent on a runaway fusion reaction. The fusion still ends once the fuel has expanded enough and been exhausted, but the densities and temperatures reached are high enough and last long enough that there is a spectacular release of energy from the bomb fuel.Now there are versions of inertial confinement fusion reactor design, which use the same basic principle as a bomb to try to initiate a fusion reaction, but these limit the energy release by using very tiny pellets of fuel. So while the reaction would runaway, ideally, it would cut off due to the drop in density and exhaustion of fuel before a big enough energy release would occur to be dangerous.it’s similar to the use of controlled explosions in the pistons in internal combustion engines. You don’t set out to build a huge fuel air explosive based on gasoline, you set out to build a motor instead, so that is what you get. You don’t get a bomb.In practice inertial confinement fusion reactors have proved hard to actually make work, aside from fusion bombs, which you could I suppose loosely call fusion reactors.The other appraches to building fusion reactors are either working in regimes of density and temperature in which the fusion reaction will always be self-limiting, or else they are using very small amounts of fusion fuel and are pulsed.Such designs inherently avoid the possibility of a runaway reaction. It’s not quite the same way as thermal spectrum nuclear reactors do this, but it is analogous. The conditions needed for a working power reactor are very diffferent than those needed for a bomb.Now, if the approach is magnetic confinement, then in the very largest machines designed, the energy stored in the confining magnetic fields is huge, and it certainly could produce quite an explosion in principle, but it would be like a conventional explosion at worst, even if there were no mitigation at all designed into the reactor building.If the confining magnets were to explode, the confining field would be lost, and the fusion reactions in the plasma would quickly end. So there would never be a thermonuclear explosion.Now in the early days, people, namely Edward Teller, did worry that a nuclear or thermonuclear explosion might ignite the Earth’a atmosphere or the oceans in a runaway fusion reaction. So, before the Trinity test I believe, Hans Bethe actually did a calculation that showed, correctly, as it turned out, after many bomb tests in the atmosphere and oceans, that while the energy of the weapon can and does certainly produce some nuclear reactions in the atmosphere or oceans, which do release some energy, still, the power released by these reactions is much smaller than the power disssipated otherwise in the atmosphere or oceans, so that a self-sustaining reaction in the atmosphere simply cannot be started this way. It is not at all like setting fire to dry kindling.No possibility of such a fusion reaction initiated by a thermonuclear weapon exists.","3,658 followers",Brent Oster,3.6K,357,1.8M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Whats-the-safest-way-to-make-energy

Hydrogen is fully 10^10 times more abundant by atoms in the universe than any combination of fission fuels (U233, U235, Pu239).3) When fusion fails to work, it tends to just flame out, and serious accidents and melt downs do not tend to happen4) Neutrons and gammas produced by fission reactors are hard to shield for small fusion reactor applications. Charged particles like protons produced from He3-He3 fusion are somewhat easier and more cost effective to shield. A combination of magnetic fields and electrostatic fields can be used to provide a low mass solution for biological shielding needed to provide excellent operator safety for mobile He3-He3 Inertial Confinement fusion reactors.Helium3-Helium3 fusionHe3 + He3-> He4 + 2 protons + 12.86 MeV (energy)He3-He3 fusion produces only charged protons and energy (no difficult to shield neutrons at all).Charged Protons produced from He3-He3 fusion can be collected on light weight grids and screens and used to directly power electric motors that actually drive the wheels of a fusion-electric car or other small fusion application (Iron Man Suit?). Neutronless He3-He3 fusion does not require an expensive precision turbine-generator to convert nuclear heat into electricity (for He3-He3 fusion, lower cost and lighter weight direct collection of charged particles on grids suffices).The energy required from a fusion driver to successfully ignite small sub-gram DT ICF fusion capsules has been experimentally shown[1] to be about 20 MJ delivered to a 2mm spot in less than 3 nanoseconds. 20 MJ is the amount of energy released when burning 2.5 cups of automotive gasoline. The requirements of He3-He3 fuson are expected to be about 40X requirements for DT ICF fusion.Will there ever be small fusion reactors directly powering fusion cars, planes, rockets, and even power tools?Perhaps not in the near term.Small fusion reactors with low shielding requirements powered by He3-He3 aneutronic fusion will probably arise at some point in our future. The style of fusion device most likely to support this style of fusion is Inertial Confinement Fusion.[1] - Cold war Halite-Centurion Field Tests at the Nevada Test SiteNY Times article published at the time of Halite-Centurion field tests - Secret Advance in Nuclear Fusion Spurs a Dispute Among ScientistsSecret Advance in Nuclear Fusion Spurs a Dispute Among ScientistsThe following document contains what John Lindl was permitted to release publicly regarding Halite-Centurion ICF by DOE""Development of the Indirect drive Approach to Inertial Confinement Fusion and the Target Physics Basis for Ignition and Gain."" John Lindl. Page: 3937. AIP Physics of Plasma. American Institute of Physics, 14 June 1995.http://hifweb.lbl.gov/public/Sha...Fusion Rocketry -At some point fusion rockets are almost certain to be built.Fusion nuclear fuels are 10^11 times more prevalent in the universe as any combination of fission nuclear fuels. If you want to explore the universe and go where no one else has gone, it is better to use nuclear fusion rather than chemical rockets or nuclear fission based rockets.Using an aneutronic fusion fuel cycle like p-B11 is not required for astronaut safety. Fast neutrons from DD and DT fusion can be safely shielded with only modest spacecraft mass penaltyTo reduce the radiation hazard for manned missions to Mars and beyond, a high-specific-impulse –high-thrust system is needed. Such system could be produced by a repeated serial burst inertial confinement pure fusion propulsion system.Igniting fusion fuels in discrete controlled pure fusion thermonuclear bursts would require a compact pure fusion driver (laser or ion beam) capable of delivering around 20 MJ of energy focused into a 2mm diameter spot within less than 2 to 3 nanoseconds. Convenient scalable pure fusion energy from a repeated serial burst ICF system can be achieved using a hybrid two-stage DT-DD fusion capsule. The primary first stage of the hybrid two-stage fusion target uses a half gram of the easiest to ignite Deuterium-Tritium fuel. The secondary stage consists of a long thin tapered cylinder that holds cryo-deuterium liquid under great static pressure. Ignition is achieved via a laser or light-ion particle beam fusion driver which ignites the small spherical DT primary and produces a shock ignited thermonuclear detonation wave in the compressed deuterium liquid in the slightly tapered cylindrical secondary. The length of the cylindrical secondary can be arbitrarily long and the yield of the device can be conveniently tuned to any desired yield over a wide range. To avoid a large radiator, needed to remove the heat from the absorption of the fast neutrons in the spacecraft, the microexplosion is surrounded by a thick layer of liquid hydrogen, stopping the neutrons and heating the hydrogen to a temperature of ∼ 10^5 K, which as a fully ionized plasma can be repelled from the spacecraft by a magnetic mirror.While both DD and DT fusion produces neutrons, the problem of neutron shielding required to provide safety for astronauts and Mars colonists while on their 30 day or less transit to a destination like Mars can be accomplished by constructing the spacecraft along the lines of the 2001 Space Odyssey Discovery spacecraft. The Discovery was a very long spacecraft that separated by a long distance the forward spherical crew section from the fusion nuclear engines at the rear. The solid angle required to completely shield astronauts from neutron radiation is small and the mass of shielding required is relatively small. Effective shielding for high energy DT and DD fusion neutrons can be arranged in a two stage process.In DT fusion, about 80% of the fusion energy is released into fast neutrons while in DD fusion 66% of the energy of fusion is released into neutrons. Fast neutrons from DT and DD fusion cannot be deflected by a nozzle formed as a magnetic mirror. Still worse, the neutrons would heat the spacecraft, which then would requires a large radiator to dissipate heat into space. This problem can be addressed by surrounding the neutron-releasing DT-DD fusion burst with a sufficiently thick layer of surrounding liquid hydrogen. This layer greatly reduces the energy of the fast neutrons which are then be absorbed by the boron-carbide layer of the fusion nozzle. The heating the thick layer of hydrogen to the high temperatures would cause it to become a fully ionized plasma, which could be deflected by a magnetic mirror. The alpha particles of the DT-DD thermonuclear reactions are stopped at a distance much smaller than the fast neutrons in the boron-carbide face of the fusion rocket nozzle.The first stage shielding then uses the thick layer of liquid hydrogen. Materials composed of light low Z elements slow neutrons primarily via elastic scattering. Collisions of neutrons with nuclei similar in mass to that of a neutron transfer more energy per scatter than collisions with heavy nuclei, and so require fewer scattering events for the same energy loss. The neutrons are then fully absorbed and stopped in the layer of boron-carbide facing the fusion rocket nozzle and the rear of the spacecraft. Supplementary radiation shielding along the critical solid angle between the fusion rocket engines and the astronaut crew compartment can be supplied by storing crew drinking water in such a way as to block and absorb neutrons before they enter the crew compartment.At some point more advanced fusion reactions like He3-He3 and P-B11 will be used that release their energy primarily as charged particles (protons and charged alpha particles). In the case of advanced fusion reactions that produce few (or no) neutrons, a magnetic nozzle can be used to direct thrust away from the rocket.Drawing of a pulsed magnetic nozzle used to protect a fusion rocket emitting charged particles like protons or alpha particles from hot plasma exhaust.Comparison of major fusion fuel cycles (including He3-He3)",3 followers,Amogh Joshi,6.5K,359,3.3M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Whats-the-safest-way-to-make-energy

Shockingly, they lived together out of wedlock and she was ostracized by society.In Switzerland, she was a guest of Lord Byron’s and on one gloomy, rainy day, Lord Byron proposed a challenge to his bored guests: everyone would write a ghost story and they would all decide the winner.While the men quickly lost interest in the project, Mary created Frankenstein, a work that would change the face of English literature.I know there is going to be a bit of backlash on this answer so here’s a quote by Isaac Asimov, a prolific writer who popularized the science fiction genre.“Mary Shelley was the first to make use of a new finding of science which she advanced further to a logical extreme, and it is that which makes",2 followers,Rui Silva,3.5K,9.2K,44.4M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Theoretically-what-is-the-smallest-a-fusion-reactor-could-be-And-could-we-use-it-to-create-a-sci-fi-movie-type-spaceship

It’s so far outside the box that it can’t even remember what the box even looks like. It is box-free. Utterly unboxed. No box can contain this idea.It’s also completely barking mad.Is it possible that hydrodynamic shock through liquid metal might induce fusion? Well, err, um, sure, I guess.Is this reactor going to work? I’d place odd...","220,642 followers",Franklin Veaux,550,47.3K,783.1M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Whats-the-safest-way-to-make-energy

They say that they are going to take hundreds of pistons and slam a big sphere of spinning molten metal with all of these pistons in order to compress the ball of molten metal. Inside of this spinning molten metal they want to inject fusion fuel, preheated deuterium plasma they say, just before they slam it with the high speed pistons, and they think the fuel is going to be compressed enough that way to yield energy by fusion.The demo system will have several hundred piDude, just save your money, do not invest in it.

Inside of this spinning molten metal they want to inject fusion fuel, preheated deuterium plasma they say, just before they slam it with the high speed pistons, and they think the fuel is going to be compressed enough that way to yield energy by fusion.The demo system will have several hundred pistons. Perhaps around 500.But why go to all this trouble of building all of these pistons?Why not just build a hydrogen bomb, according to the well-proven and well-tested Teller-Ulam design, and explode it, and use it to boil a lot of water into steam in a big underground cavity? Then use the steam to generate electricity. This can and it will absolutely work, and it is viable fusion technology. Do you anticipate any problems with it? I can think of some myself. But it can and will work to generate power.I suspect that these pistons are going to be torn to shreds by hydrodynamic instabilities, when they hit the spinning molten metal inside.Here’s some critical commentary by Erich Vogt, former director at TRIUMF.https://services.cap.ca/drupal/sites/cap.ca/files/article/1700/oct10-opinion-vogt.pdfWithout any experimental proof in PoP it is the following matters, among others, which place this reactor concept in Aristophanes’ “Cloud Cuckooland”:1) The system of pistons for compression seems intended to produce a compression, in a few μs, so perfectly synchronous that it will not induce the plasma instabilities which normally make hot plasma squish out from any efforts to confine it. The amount of compression is to be an extravagant factor of a thousand. This seems to be an unnecessarily complicated compression system.2) The hot plasma, in contact with its walls, is expected to undergo fusion perfectly, for 7 μs - a time which is substantial compared to the distances which the plasma atoms travel in a few μs - without heat dissipation into the walls or damping problems from ablated wall materials. (Any high Z impurities in the plasma would furiously generate Bremmstrahlung.)3) The liquid metal blanket is supposed to absorb the neutrons and the reaction heat perfectly, although the technical solutions for it, even for the mainline fusion projects, are expected to take decades to solve.4) The regeneration of the expensive tritium by the blanket is expected to perform perfectly even though many despair, as Moyer relates [3], of ever achieving such recovery from a fusion reactor. A fusion reactor burns $100 M worth of tritium each week so that the perfect regeneration of the tritium is essential.5) The reactor is touted to be “clean” even though, per Joule, fusion releases more neutrons than fission and the neutron environment of the system would likely be very toxic. As an expert quoted in Moyer’s article [3] says: “If someone wants to sell you any kind of nuclear system and says that there is no radioactivity, hang onto your wallet”.6) A 600 Mega Joule energy release is equivalent to that from the explosion of 100 kg of TNT. In the reactor such an “explosion” occurs every second. The fusion reactor must operate continuously surviving such “explosions”.","3,658 followers",Brent Oster,3.6K,357,1.8M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Whats-the-safest-way-to-make-energy
