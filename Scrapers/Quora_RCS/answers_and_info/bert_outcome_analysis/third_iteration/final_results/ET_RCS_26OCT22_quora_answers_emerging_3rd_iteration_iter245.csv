There are half a dozen ways to approach a problem like this. Almost endless combinations of ways to think about approaching problems in general.But when you find that one way that just “clicks” for you, you can kick the crap out of every problem resembling that style that you come across. Somehow that entire chapter went from bizarre to trivial.You can findFor me, it was those Calc-2 volume problems. Find the volume of this bull horned head. Whaaaaaat. Man, that screwed me up. No idea why, some people just got it. In fact, that gave me a crap midterm and would become the only math class I didn’t get a perfect 4.0 in.So I went off to YouTube and I watched a dozen different people solve the problem until one “spoke to me” and boom. Epiphany, I just “got it” and never had to study it again.Computer Science is all that stuff on steroids.What’s even more, is that you often need to figure out how to make sense of the approaches you wouldn’t take. An old principal engineer that I looked up to used to tell me “when you’re a junior dev and have time, solve your task in 4 different ways. You’ll grow as a developer extremely fast.”And so there are two points. When you get kind of weird ones like solving an AVL tree with pen and paper on a test, find what “speaks to you,” and when you have different ways to approach problems, read about the patterns involved, architectural schools of thought, etc. Often there are multiple right answers, and it’s very good to see that.No question about sites in our field is complete without this honorable mention of course. Another dev I worked with used to joke that our methodology was SODD (Stack Overflow Driven Development).Truthfully, this goes in the different ways of looking at and doing things though. It’s important to be able to find answers in documents, but it’s also good to see how many people think about the same thing and form your own solutions based on inspiration drawn from an array of ideas.",216 followers,Garry Bachhal,1.4K,0,0,2015,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-top-websites-computer-science-students-must-visit

Only 1% of the population in Nigeria, Ghana, Bangladesh and Uganda say they own a working landline telephone in their household, while 89% in Nigeria, 83% in Ghana, 76% in Bangladesh and 65% in Uganda own cell phones. This compares with 60% landline penetration in the U.S.​Chinese internet users love to shop. About half of online Chinese (52%) have used the internet to buy products in the past 12 months. Given the size of the online Chinese marketplace, this goes a long way in explaining the meteoric rise of commerce giants such as Alibaba and Baidu.3Filipinos love social networking. Among adult internet users in the Philippines, 93% say that they use social networking sites, such as Facebook and Twitter. This is the highest such percentage across the emerging and developing countries surveyed and greater than the 74% of internet users in the U.S. who use social networking sites. Roughly seven-in-ten of those Filipino social networkers use these platforms to share views about music and movies, while half talk about sports.Social Media Popular in Emerging and Developing Nations​Indians and Bangladeshis use the internet for job hunting. Very few people in India and Bangladesh use the internet – only 20% and 11% respectively. But among those who do, job searching is a popular activity. Majorities of internet users in Bangladesh (62%) and India (55%) say they have looked for a job online in the past year, the highest rates among the 31 countries surveyed that have enough internet users to analyze.5Young Thais are internet enthusiasts. In every country we polled, younger people ages 18 to 34 are substantially more likely to say they use the internet than those who are older. Especially large differences occur in Asia, and particularly in Thailand, where 83% of 18- to 34-year-olds are online, but only 27% of those 35 and older are.6Politics is a big social media topic in Lebanon. Among Lebanese who use social networks, an astounding three-quarters say they use the platform for discussing politics. Similar levels of political participation occur among social network users in Egypt (66%) and Jordan (63%). Across all the countries surveyed with sufficient numbers, only a median of 34% say they talk politics using social media, including 16% of Filipino and Vietnamese social networkers and 19% of Indonesians.Middle Eastern Social Media Users More Likely to Talk Politics​Ukrainians get their political news online. Overall, a median of 54% of internet users across emerging and developing countries surveyed use the internet to get political news and information. But in Ukraine that figure is much higher: Eight-in-ten internet users do so. The survey was fielded after the ousting of President Viktor Yanukovych from office in early 2014 and toward the beginning of the ongoing conflict with Russian-backed rebels in eastern Ukraine, meaning many Ukrainians followed those news events online. However, only 53% of Ukrainians have access to the internet.8Nearly eight-in-ten Russians own a computer. Due to the rise of smartphones, many people in emerging and developing nations access the internet from a device other than a personal computer. But about eight-in-ten Americans (80%) and Russians (78%) have a working computer in their household. In contrast, only 3% in Uganda say they have a computer in their home.9Venezuelans like taking pictures and videos with their phones. Overall, Latin Americans (just like in the U.S.) are the quite keen on capturing the world around them, with more than six-in-ten mobile owners in Chile, Mexico, Argentina, Brazil and Nicaragua saying they have taken videos or pictures with their phones in the past year. In Venezuela, this is particularly common: Three-quarters of cell phone owners (who constitute 88% of the adult population) use their device to take pictures or video.10Many Poles access medical information online, especially women. More than six-in-ten internet users in Poland (64%) say they have gotten health information online in the past 12 months. This includes 72% of female internet users, but only 56% of male users.

The QWERTY layout keyboard was designed to slow you downThe QWERTY keyboard layout is the one we all know and love today: it's the standard layout for Latin-script alphabets on typewriters and computers, with keys arranged in a certain way for efficient typing. But did you know it wasn't always like this? The QWERTY arrangement of letters was designed to keep typewriter keys from jamming when they were struck quickly in succession.3. 92% of the world's currency is digitalThere are about $5 trillion dollars in circulation worldwide, but guess what: 92 per cent of that money exists only as digital data. The rest is cash—paper bills and coins—which amounts to just 8 per cent of the world's money supply!4. Did you know that many Poles access medical information online, especially women?In Poland, many people go online to access medical information when they're sick or concerned about their health. A recent survey by [company name] found that 66% of Poles with Internet access look for information about medicines, 42% look for information about symptoms, and 41% look for information on doctors and hospitals.5. Did you know that domain name registrations were free until 1995?Domain names were free until 1995, which is when the National Science Foundation started charging $100 a year to register a domain name. Previously, users had been able to register them for free as long as they agreed to have their data published in an online database that could be accessed by anyone connected to the Internet.6. Did you know that the original Tron was snubbed for ""cheating""?Disney's ""Tron"" was snubbed by some critics because it was accused of cheating with its use of computer animation techniques like rotoscoping and backlighting.7. In 1956, 5 megabytes (5MB) of data weighed a tonToday, hard drives can hold millions of documents or hundreds of movies, and they can all fit in your pocket. But for the first couple decades of computers, storage was a major challenge.Magnetic tape storage was invented in the 1930s, but it wasn't until 1956 that IBM began manufacturing what we would now consider a hard disk drive: the IBM 305 RAMAC. This drive held 5MB (that's megabytes—not gigabytes!) and weighed over a ton! In today's terms, that would be about 0.001% of an iPhone's memory, and an iPhone weighs about 0.01% of what the RAMAC did.8. The X-Y position indicator for displays – a.k.a The MouseIn 1961, Douglas Engelbart built the first mouse prototype out of wood at Stanford Research Institute. It was invented as part of his work developing new ways to interact with computers, which he called ""X-Y position indicators for displays."" It had one button and used two wheels to detect X- and Y-coordinates.9. Russia built a computer that ran on water: in 1936The first computer to run on water was invented by Russian engineer Leon Theremin in 1936. As an experiment, Theremin ran an electric current through water molecules to show that they could be used as a basic computer circuit. The idea is similar to using water to conduct electricity through hydro.10. QWERTY vs ABC layouts in advanced graphing calculatorsSome advanced graphing calculators (like the TI-84 Plus) use QWERTY instead of ABC layouts for their keyboards. This is because their keys are so small that using an ABC layout would be nearly impossible, and using a QWERTY layout makes it easier to find the keys you need.11. Wikipedia needs an army of anti-vandal botsWikipedia is a haven for vandals. Its pages get vandalized about 2,500 times a day. Luckily, it has a powerful army of bots who spend all day tracking down and undoing the damage. These bots make up over half of Wikipedia's editing activity!12. A 15-year old with a PC hacked NASA in 1999In 1999, a 15-year old boy named Jonathan James hacked into NASA's network and stole software worth over $1 million dollars. He was sentenced to six months house arrest and became known as America's youngest cybercriminal convict!13. Young Thais are internet enthusiastsThailand is a country that lags behind other countries in most technology metrics.However, the Thais are actually internet enthusiasts. According to a Thai Communications Ministry survey, 77% of young people have access to the internet and use it at least once a day.While Thailand may be a poor country, only 9% of children do not have access to the internet.This is an incredibly high rate for any country.","2,308 followers",Wrimmy,33.4K,0,0,2015,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-top-websites-computer-science-students-must-visit

You must be wondering how this was even possible? Well, to be able to send an email, you just need a phone, computer, and a connection to Micronet. It was not yet as vast as the www that we know now.QWERTY is not just a keyboard designThis was actually used to keep people from typing too fast. That way, the typists will not jam the keys. Not only that, it is believed that this was the ideal design for a keyboard to help decipher the Morse code.Data used to weigh a tonToday, we have compact hardware that can carry huge amounts of data. In the past, that was not the case. Back in 1956, 5MB of data weighed at least a ton. This was the hard drive used by the RAMAC, the first computer that had the similar hard drive features as what we have today.Most of the currency in the world is digitalMost of the money in the world is online.

The Shinkansen Bullet TrainThe bullet train in Shinkansen, Japan is a prime example of biomimicry— an approach to innovation inspired by nature. To lessen the piercing sound of their high-speed trains, Japanese engineers took a nod from the common kingfisher— a bird that can dart its beak into water at high speeds without making so much as a ripple.2.

VelcroSwiss engineer George de Mestral came up with the idea for velcro when he was picking burrs out of his dog's fur. The tiny hooks on a strip of velcro are modeled after the hooks that make burrs stick to your socks after a hike.3. GeckSkin AdhesiveDeveloped at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, GeckSkin is a super strong adhesive based on the mechanics of gecko feet. A piece of GeckSkin the size of an index card can hold up to 700 pounds on a smooth surface— much like a gecko holding its own weight on a vertical wall.4. Mercedes-Benz BionicRolled out in 2005, the body of this concept car was inspired by the aerodynamic shape of the yellow boxfish, allowing it to be one of the most efficient vehicles of its size.5. COM-BAT Spy PlaneIn an army-funded project, researchers at the University of Michigan developed a six-inch spy plane which uses the wing anatomy and communication style of bats to transmit information about the sights and sounds of an urban combat zone.6. Beijing's WatercubeBuilt to host aquatic events at the 2008 Olympics in Beijing, the Watercube's design is based on the structure of soap bubbles. In addition to just looking cool, the flexible bubble pods make the building earthquake resistant.7. Shark Skin CoatingThe microscopic pattern of a shark's skin reduces drag and prevents microorganisms from building up on the surface. NASA teamed up with 3M to produce a coating for boats with similar benefits.8. Spider-Inspired GlassSome spiders protect their webs with an extra silky layer that reflects ultraviolet rays so birds don't fly into them and ruin the spider's hard work. German engineers used this same strategy to solve the problem of birds smacking into windows and glass doors. Ornilux glass is glazed with a special web pattern visible to birds but not humans, saving a lot of birdies from seeing stars.9.  Whale Fin Wind BladesEver wonder how massive whales can move so gracefully through the water? It has a lot to do with the bumpy ridges on their fins, called tubercles. Frank Fish, a professor at West Chester University, discovered that adding similar bumps to the blades of wind turbines reduced drag and noise while increasing speed and the amount of energy harnessed. Two fins up!10. Ultra Efficient LEDsThe light inside a firefly is amplified by the sharp, jagged scales of its anatomy. Scientists copied the structure of the insect's belly to increase the efficiency of LED lights by 55 percent.Technology Breakthoughs That Never Would've Happened Without Nature",70 followers,Ankit Saigal,25.1K,0,0,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-of-the-most-interesting-facts-in-the-world-of-technology

But, when your boss is passing you coffee and it spills on your shirt, you might not shout. You may even smile ‘It’s okay.’You will think twice before you show anger on someone who is more powerful than you.But with people whom you think are lower than you or whom you take for granted, you show it effortlessly.

We have the technology today but the energy costs are extreme.Cheap clean energy changes everything and simplyTravel to space will be somewhat routine thanks to a space elevator and/or nuclear rockets. Both technologies need one scientific breakthrough and then a bunch of engineering. The main problem will be that there isn't actually all that much reason for most people to go to space: science, tourism, satellite maintenance, perhaps a bit of asteroid mining. Humanity will launch the first interstellar probes and generally begin considering interstellar travel.There will be a small colony on Mars similar to today's on Antarctica, mostly for research, and to satisfy the human desire to explore. You'll be able to visit, but the price will be incredible and few people will do so.AI will be roughly as smart as humans, and robots will do most of the jobs humans do today. Most things will be very cheap, but only high end engineers and artists will be able to find work. A basic income policy will have been introduced long before, and it will support most of the population. By 50 years from now this will seem perfectly normal. The few people who work will get benefits like waterfront homes and private resorts, along with extreme prestige. (This is the utopian version. I also have a dystopian version, but I'm in a good mood today.)Entertainment will be fully immersive. You won't be able to tell it's not real. You might even be able to erase the memory that you're in a program, so that you think you're really there. Maybe you're in a program right now and don't even know it.
