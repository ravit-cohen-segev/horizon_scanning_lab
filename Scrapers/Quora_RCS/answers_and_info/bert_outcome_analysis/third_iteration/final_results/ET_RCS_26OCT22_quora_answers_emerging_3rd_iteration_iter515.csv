The CEO wants to increase the employee's comp, but the therapist wisely advises that what the employee really wants is ""forward momentum"".Many companies try to keep their employees happy - they bring in ping pong tables, happy hour snacks and branded T-shirts. But happiness is volatile and hard to maintain during business challenges.Smart companies try to keep their employees motivated.

There are a few ways thiGreen blockchain initiativesBlockchains can potentially use a lot of energy and create high levels of carbon emissions – this fact was behind Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s decision to temporarily stop accepting Bitcoin in payment for his cars earlier in 2021. For this very good reason, during 2022, we are likely to see a great deal of emphasis on attempts to “greenify” blockchain. There are a few ways this can be done, including carbon offsetting, although many people consider that this often equates to simply patching up a wound that shouldn’t have been caused in the first place. Another is by moving to less energy-intensive models of blockchain technology – typically those that rely on “proof-of-stake” algorithms rather than “proof-of-work” to generate consensus. Ethereum – the second best-known blockchain after Bitcoin – plans to move to a POS model during 2022. Another route to a greener operating model is the one championed by Cathy Wood, CEO of tech-focused hedge fund Ark Invest. This posits the view that growing demand for energy will lead to greater investments into generating renewable energy, which will then be used for other applications as well as operating blockchains.NFT expanding beyond online artNon-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) were the big news in the blockchain scene during 2021. Astronomical prices achieved by artwork such as Beeple’s The First 5000 Days created plenty of headlines, placing the concept of unique digital tokens residing on blockchains firmly in the public consciousness. It’s also firmly taken hold in the music world, with artists including Kings of Leon, Shawn Mendes, and Grimes all releasing tracks in NFT format. But like blockchain in general, the idea has potential beyond it’s first publicity-grabbing use cases. Distillers William Grant and Son recently sold bottles of 46-year-old Glenfiddich whisky alongside NFTs, which are used to prove each bottle’s provenance. NFTs in gaming are starting to take off in a big way – monster-breeding game Axie Infinity allows players to ""mint"" their own NFT creatures to send into battle and currently has around 300,000 concurrent players (Fortnite, for comparison, has around 3.5 million). Dolce & Gabbana and Nike have both created clothing and footwear that come with their own NFTs. And the metaverse concept – championed this year by Facebook, Microsoft, and Nvidia – brings plenty of opportunities for innovative NFT use cases.More countries adopt Bitcoin and national cryptocurrencies2021 saw El Salvador become among the first nations to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender, meaning it can be accepted across the country to pay for goods and services, and businesses can use it to pay their employees. According to many commentators, during 2022, we will see a number of other countries follow suit.Alexander Hoptner, CEO of cryptocurrency exchange BitMEX, predicts that at least five developing countries will start to accept Bitcoin next year, driven by global inflation and growing remittance fees from financial ""middlemen"" organizations used to send money home by overseas workers.National cryptocurrencies – where central banks create their own coins that they can control, rather than adopting existing decentralized coins – are another area where we will see growth in 2022.

From the retail sector to the field of Healthcare and Medicine, blockchain technology has made its way into various industry verticals.If we look at the prime time of this emerging technology, we solely have to focus on the last five years. This is because ICO conducted the very first time by Mastercoin in the year 2013 and just a year later one of the most popular Japan-based bitcoin exchanges, My Gox collapsed.2015 was the year when Ethereum was launched with its new Smart Contract functionality and then in the same year, Coinbase raised a total of $75 million. And in just a span of two years, the tech giant IBM made a huge announcement of collaborating with European banks in order to build a blockchain-based financial trading platform. With that being said, let’s talk about the top emerging blockchain trends in 2019 that will provide us more insights regarding the future of blockchain.Top Emerging Blockchain Trends In 2019There are many blockchain solutions that can be easily named as the best blockchain trends so let's see which blockchain future trends will make it big in the year 2019 and why:1. Federated BlockchainThe term Federated Blockchain can be referred to as one of the best blockchain trends that are basically an upgraded form of the basic blockchain model, which makes it more ideal for many specific use-cases. As per many experts, we can say that there will be a rise in the usage of federated blockchain as it provides private blockchain an outlook that is more customizable.For most of the part, federated blockchains are quite similar to private blockchains, but there are still a couple of differences present. For instance, in this type of blockchain instead of one organization, there are multiple authorities to control the pre-selected nodes of the blockchain. Now, this selected group of various nodes will make sure to validate the block so that the transactions can be processed further.Federated BlockchainKey Points To Know About Federated Blockchain:The federated blockchain operates under various authorities instead of following a single secure and highly trusted node.Here, the authority nodes are selected previously from different organizations that are connected to this blockchain network.The group that is selected will be responsible for maintaining the network and validating the block as well.In this network, only the group holds access to inner-restricted areas.Best Use Cases Of Federated Blockchain:2. Stable CoinsAs we are well aware of the fact that Cryptocurrencies are basically a side product of blockchain technology and one of the main things here is that they are volatile in nature. As of now, the stable coins are in their initial phase and it is predicted that 2019 will be the year when the blockchain stable coins will achieve their all-time highs.Top Applications of Stable Coins:1. Additional layers of security from currency crashes: As the name suggests, stable coins are steady and don’t fluctuate that often so the user doesn’t have to constantly worry about currency crashes. This also allows users to invest in more cryptocurrencies.2. Fast Remittances and Affordable: The process of sending remittances overseas is now simplified with the help of these stable coins. Another thing about these coins is that they are very fast and hold the same value as the flat coins.3. Streamline Recurring and P2P payments: We are aware that making peer-to-peer (P2P) payments is much easier with stable coins. The users can even use them on smart contracts to conduct the automated payments.4. More Stable Currency Exchanges: The stable coins can further contribute to stabilizing the market while improving the overall situation of the cryptocurrency market. This will also eliminate additional risks and unnecessary regulations.5. Regular Currency: The stable coins currency can be used on a regular basis as an everyday currency in a similar manner like Fiat money along with the legal backups. For example, you can use them like any other digital currency for making online purchases.Limitations of Stable Coins:Unstable: The crypto backed or commodity backed stable coins can become unstable as well due to the sudden crashes of pricing. This might be a huge problem because it is still unclear how the stable coins will back up if the value of their assets drops in the real world experience.Trust Issues: Because of the centralized nature of the stable coins, the users cannot completely trust their system as they still need to prove their applications in the real world.Regulations: The majority of the coins have the same regulations as the Fiat money and that’s why this statement ultimately clashes with the main objective of cryptocurrencies.Centralized: The stable coins operates on a centralized system which basically contradicts the primary nature of the blockchain technology.3. Blockchain As A Service (BaaS)Another blockchain solution is BaaS that stands for Blockchain As A Service, it is a new blockchain technology that is currently integrated by a number of startups as well as enterprises. But such blockchain future trends may not always be feasible when it comes to creating, maintaining and managing a new blockchain solution.For this we now at the option of BaaS i.e. Blockchain As A Service which is a cloud-based service which enables the users to develop their own digital products by working with blockchain. These digital products may be smart contracts, applications or even other services that can work without any setup requirement of the complete blockchain-based infrastructure. Some of the tech companies that already provide the BaaS service are Microsoft and Amazon.4. Security TokensTwo years ago, ICOs were the talk of the town and now they have been replaced by the STOs. There are many reasons why security tokens by blockchain will be one of the top blockchain trends, for instance, approximately 50 percent of the ICOs turned out to be a scam which automatically affects the trust of the investors. This is the part where Security Token Offering i.e. STO are started to emerge in the field of technology.Security TokensIn other words, ICO can be defined as a token offering from an organization or company for the purpose of raising capital for a particular project. The ICOs are also highly unregulated which makes them a bigger risk for the investors. The key difference between security tokens and ICO is that STO is regulated.Advantages of Using Security Tokens:1. In the case of STO, there is no need for the company founders to invest in a specific use case for the tokens to raise more revenue. Here, all tokens are backed up by some already stated assets.2. Security tokens also offer various legal rights, for example, revenue distribution, voting etc. This also adds an extra level of security for the assets that are stolen.3. Apart from this, STO also provides a fundraising solution that is very transparent in comparison to other services for both investors as well as the companies.Major Issues With Security Tokens:Not a popular option: The security tokens are still not a popular option as major cryptocurrency exchanges are not supporting STOs yet. But a few of them have started to emerge in the blockchain market.Requires Administration: The blockchain security token offering requires official administration from the financial authorities which also increase the legal costs.5. Interoperability In Blockchain TechnologyThe term blockchain interoperability can be defined as the ability to share data and other information across multiple blockchain systems as well as networks. This function makes it simple for the public to see and access the data across different blockchain networks. For example, you can send your data from one Ethereum blockchain to a specific EOS blockchain.Benefits Of Interoperability Between Blockchains:1. The blockchain interoperability makes it's easy and simple for users to transact from one blockchain to another.2. Apart from this, this function also offers a range of diverse functionalities, for example, cross-chain transactions.3. Interoperability also enhances multi-token transactions with the development of multi-token wallet systems.Few Notable Vendors Of Blockchain Interoperability:Blocknet: The Blocknet is a project that is constantly striving to build a decentralized exchange in a bid to exchange an interexchange communication.Wanchain: The project Wanchain is mainly about leveraging the cross-chain capabilities to enhancing the connection between the consortium, private and public blockchains.6. Ricardian ContractsA Ricardian contract can be defined as a human-readable legal agreement that is also agreed and signed upon by both of the parties that are involved in the contract. It further gets converted into a machine-readable contract that also defines the listed intentions of the involved parties.Basics of Ricardian Contract:1. Flow: The flow of this type of contract can easily automate the operations on various blockchain applications that are based on this technology.2. Purpose: The Ricardian contract also records the terms of an agreement as a legal document.3. Versatile: In case of any Ricardian contract, it can be also stated as a smart contract.4. Validity: This blockchain contract is a legally binding agreement/document.5. Readable: The Ricardian contract is both machine as well as human readable.Advantages of Ricardian Contract:It acts as a smart contract as it not only defines the intentions of both involved parties under legal terms but also execute additional instructions.The costs involved in such blockchain contracts is comparatively less and in addition to this, the Ricardian contract also saves time and effort of the users.As it is a legal binding agreement, both the parties can end up in the court of law if anything goes wrong as per the contract details.7. Hybrid BlockchainsNext, in the list of new blockchain technology in 2019 is hybrid blockchain which can be simply defined as the blockchain that attempts to use the most appropriate part of the public as well as the private blockchain solutions.If we opt for an example of an ideal world scenario then the hybrid blockchain will be mainly controlled across various platforms.
