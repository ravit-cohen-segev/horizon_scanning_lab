While China has already started a trade war against the latter and is planning to build a $1 trillion AI industry by 2030. That being said, back home we are figuring out 10 predictions on artificial intelligence in 2030. In 1957, when USSR launched the world’s first-ever artificial satellite, Sputnik 1, the US went berserk and got into a frenzy of competition. And this histrionic tug of war finally led the humans to land on the moon.Now 60 years later, we are most likely going to have our “Sputnik” moment, provided the artificial intelligence war continues between the US and China. The tug war this time is not to put the first step on the moon but to become the AI world leader.The AI arms race continues…However, it was China and not the USA, who took the first wakeup call. China created the first-ever AlphaGo, an AI-enabled computer program designed for the board game, Go. This first-ever AI-led computer game was invented by a Chinese company, DeepMind based in London. In 2016, South Korean master Lee Se-dol had lost to AlphaGo at the ancient Chinese board game Go. And in 2017, this AI game had also defeated the Chinese world champion, Ke Jie.Impressed by the newly enabled AI platform as a service and realizing its potential, the Chinese Govt. decided to invest in the then-upcoming AI technology in full bloom. After two years of its inception, China is determinedAnthony Mullen, Research Director at Gartner had this to say,“Right now, AI is a two-horse race between China and the US.” And, says Mullen, China has all the ingredients it needs to move into first. These include government funding, a massive population, a lively research community, and a society that seems primed for technological change.”This brings us to ask the trillion-dollar question –Who is going to win the AI race – the US or China?Who’s going to make the killing?While China is ushering on its 1.4 billion population to build a data mine for its artificial intelligence service offerings, the US, on the other hand, has alone invested $76 billion out of the total $176 billion investment in the AI sector worldwide.While other countries like Russia are trying to win the rat race, the above-mentioned rivals are already in a bid to cut each other’s throat by becoming the world’s biggest contemporaries in digital transformation that includes artificial intelligence, IoT, VR, big data, etc. whether it’s Luke vs Darth Vader, Alien vs Predator, Rocky vs Ivan Drago.10 predictions on artificial intelligence in 2030Just as the world witnessed the moon landing that has resulted from the Sputnik war, similarly we will indeed experience a revolution in this advanced technology following this tug of war. Taking this opportunity, we’ve narrowed down 10 predictions on artificial intelligence in 2030 and how it is going to disrupt industries and humans on the whole.We have divided our list of 12 AI predictions into two parts –What will be artificial intelligence in the next 6 years i.e. by 2024?#Prediction 1Enormously empowered by technology, machines, and devices will be able to recognize objects and translate speech in real-time. While devices like ALEXA is able to do speech recognition, Google has already started working on their deep learning to enhance the speech recognition technology. Watch this video –With the speed it’s evolving, we’re pretty sure we’re going to witness something as shown in the Tom Cruise-starrer 2002 movie, Minority Report in 2024.#Prediction 2Alexa, Google Home, Siri, and Cortana will learn to adjust to your changing life.Artificial intelligence solutions and NLS (natural language systems) will become more pervasive. AI assistants will be able to learn to anticipate your requirements and likeness without you having to explicitly feed in information about yourself just was with the case of the 20th century’s robots. Smart context-oriented visual interfaces will be in use, thus augmenting the in-depth interactions.#Prediction 3Devices and machines will run individually.Next-gen airplanes will be self-controlled. Most likely they won’t even have a cockpit.Here’s an excerpt,In the future, AI will play an even bigger role, from working out what information to show the pilot to take full control of the plane. Bowman thinks that humans will be managers rather than being replaced. He envisions a human controlling a swarm of 20 drones while onboard a plane being flown by AI.Plane manufacturers like Airbus are all geared up to develop artificial intelligence-enabled engines that will enable computers to fly planes without human pilots in the near future.#Prediction 4Walmart Stores harnesses AI to optimize inventories and supply chains by predicting future demand and reordering stock. Monsanto uses artificial intelligence to identify the most promising molecules in bioengineering. John Deere (DE) expects AI to reduce chemical spraying volumes in farming. And shale oil producer Devon Energy (DVN) uses AI to guide drilling gear.Almost every enterprise, from the top players to the startups, would have integrated artificial intelligence in their businesses by 2024.Here are the statistics on revenues for AI applications in businesses worldwide from 2016 to 2025 in million USD –AI will continue to be rigorously adopted by businesses across the globe worldwide, thereby enabling them to extract data from the entire data ocean that is being generated.#Prediction 5In the recently released movie, Escape Plan 2, a robot is seen treating a person in one of the scenes.AI is going to dramatically disrupt medical diagnostic procedures. Determining the available artificial intelligence use cases in medicine, we have predicted that AI solutions will do for medicine in the next 6 years similar to what the stethoscope had done hundreds of years ago. Besides managing the mammoth-sized paperwork, AI services will offer the perfect surgical robots and finely tuned diagnostic algorithms to solve complex surgical and clinical problems.Now let’s have a look at the bigger picture…Artificial Intelligence in another 6 years i.e. (2024-2030)#Prediction 6Image source:If the teaching method is not changed today, 30 years from now, the education industry is going to be in trouble, said Jack Ma, founder of Alibaba Group.Future academics will be led by artificial intelligence and blockchain technology. AI will grow beyond what we know today just as Dr. Will Caster, the role played by Johnny Depp in the 2014 movie, Transcendence.With an influx of advanced AI-led learning models, traditional educational methods are bound to take a quantum leap in the next decade. Due to digital transformation, one-to-one tutoring will more likely replace the traditional method on an enormous scale. Computers will take up the role of individual tutors in classrooms filled with diverse learning styles.#Prediction 7Digital ‘alter egos’ – the AI assistants will be doing the job of a full-time employee usually reserved for the elite class in 2045.Enhanced personal hypothesis systems will create an entirely new artificial ecosystem. AI will disrupt the design, curation, and improvement of the already existing AI-induced algorithms.#Prediction 8In future, IoT won’t work without artificial intelligence.The millennials have already grown to get used to the Internet. In future, IoT won’t work without artificial intelligence. However, advanced technologies like AI and smart connected devices are future-proof and are shaping new far-reaching developments. These cutting-edge technologies will be inducted into all the possible aspects of our lifestyle and all industries including cloud computing and big data/analytics.AI will be used with IoT to develop and strengthen man and machine partnership. For example, AI capabilities in the wall of an operating room will enable smart devices to understand their environment, and then reason and learn. A whole new artificial intelligence ecosystem will boom in the next 12 years targeting everything from healthcare, transportation, and telecom to public safety and banking.#Prediction 9The future of hardware is AI.Quantum computing extensions will be commonplace by 2030. Landmark developments in artificial intelligence distribution across multiple machines will recast the data transaction procedure. In the next 12 years, algorithms will run in parallel efficiently over thousands of Graphical Processing Units (GPUs) on each computer.Deep learning as initiated by Google relies heavily on the jaded mathematical computations. Artificial neural networks, convolutional neural networks, and recurrent neural networks are some of the futuristic aspects of deep learning. Irrespective of what kind of neural network is used, all the deep learning algorithms will be running complicated statistical computations. Right from managing the stock market data to storing the radiology report, everything will be first decoded into a set of numbers with the help of AI.#Prediction 10Artificial intelligence will be vulnerable.AI is no more confined to making Alexa or chatbots. Superpowers like US and Russia are seriously considering weaponizing AI. US is determined to make use of the AI to the extreme to maintain its military dominance.The United States has put AI at the center of its quest to maintain its military dominance. In 2014, the Pentagon had reportedly announced the US $18 billion for its ‘Future Years Defense Program’, which will be spent in allocating robotics, autonomous systems, and human-machine collaboration. China, on the other hand, is not left behind. As per the reports, the Chinese People’s Liberation Army has begun integrating artificial intelligence technology into unmanned weapon systems which include aircraft, drones, and submarines.And while the tug war continues among the US, China & Russia, it’s pretty obvious that artificial intelligence will change the world at breakneck speed. And as we write, already history is in the making in various sectors across industries through AI and IoT.","6,473 followers",Michael Soareverix,28.3K,373,6.6M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-upcoming-mind-blowing-technology-that-can-be-seen-in-2021

If not then have a look at these pictures.If you are thinking that these images have been edited, then let me tell you one thing: that these are real.Crown shynessThe effect usually occurs between trees of the same species and sometimes between different species.One theory assumes a tree's leaves can feel when they are approaching another tree. Once they sense a nearing neighbor, the growing process halts, ensuring that light can penetrate the canopy and photosynthesis continue.Another possible explanation is that this is a defense mechanism against leaf-eating insects. The gaps mean bugs wouldn't be able to reach other trees, impeding their spread.The next time you're out walking through the forest, take a moment to look above you and you might be pleasantly surprised by what you find.Edit 1: Thanks Robert Taylor for the correction.Edit 2: Thank you all for your love, affection, and kind comments.","17,471 followers",R J Holland,10.9K,4.3K,72.1M,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-upcoming-mind-blowing-technology-that-can-be-seen-in-2021
4,"Here’s one that blew my mind not that long ago when I read about it. I wrote about this before. As an amateur astronomer who has been looking at the stars since I was a kid, I found this fact amazing.My older sisters and I once found the Andromeda galaxy just above the constellation Andromeda. We were very excited to see that faint, fuzzy little patch of light that we figured was the whole Andromeda galaxy which is 2.5 million light years away from our own Milky Way galaxy. We had to look at it with averted vision to actually see it nicely. BUT, we were wrong. We were not looking at the wholeHere’s one that blew my mind not that long ago when I read about it. I wrote about this before. As an amateur astronomer who has been looking at the stars since I was a kid, I found this fact amazing.My older sisters and I once found the Andromeda galaxy just above the constellation Andromeda. We were very excited to see that faint, fuzzy little patch of light that we figured was the whole Andromeda galaxy which is 2.5 million light years away from our own Milky Way galaxy. We had to look at it with averted vision to actually see it nicely. BUT, we were wrong. We were not looking at the whole Andromeda galaxy.THAT was only the bright centre of the galaxy we were looking at, bright because the stars are densest in the centre of the galaxy. It has a cute name, the Galactic Bulge.If your eyes could gather light like a time lapse camera, and the faintest stars would become much brighter then you could actually see them, the Andromeda galaxy would look like this is the night sky beside the moon. What my sisters and I were actually looking at was the centre, the rest of the galaxy was too dim to be seen.Can you imagine seeing this sight in the night sky? It’s there, you just can’t see it, the stars are too dim.Another astonishing thing is that the Andromeda galaxy and our Milky Way galaxy are barrelling toward each other at 250,000 MPH OR 402,336 KPH. In around 4.5 billion years, the two galaxies will collide with each other. Devastating? Not really. The stars in the galaxies are so distant, there will be few if any colliding stars. The galaxies will pass through each other however, gravity will pull them back together and the two galaxies will form a giant, elliptical galaxy.When the two galaxies collide, the Solar System will be swept out three times farther from the galactic core than its current distance. They also predict a 12% chance that the Solar System will be ejected from the new galaxy sometime during the collision. Such an event would have no adverse effect on the system and the chances of any sort of disturbance to the Sun or planets themselves may be remote.However, by that time, our sun would have gone through its red giant stage and would have already consumed Mercury and Venus. Earth will be very close but it’s water would have been boiled away long ago and Earth will be at that time devoid of all life. A crispy cinder would be all that is left of that majestic, life filled world.Hang on to your hats. Our solar system located in the Orion arm of our own Milky Way galaxy which is 100,000 light years across and swirling around like a giant frisbee, travels at an average speed of 515,000 mph (828,000 km/h). Even at this rapid speed, the solar system would take about 230 million years to travel all the way around the Milky Way. That’s one hell of a merry go round ride!Above. On a dark night far away from city lights, you can see a part of our own Milky Way galaxy. You are looking toward the centre of our galaxy where stars are the densest.Our Milky Way Galaxy above showing where our solar system is located.Okay, one more mind blow. The galaxies Andromeda and the Milky Way are actually now touching. Each galaxy has what is called a Galactic Halo, gas, dust and stray stars. It was discovered that the galactic halo of our galaxy and Andromeda stretch out a lot further than thought.In other words, it’s the faint halos of the galaxies that indeed appear to have started to touch one another. Thus, in a manner of speaking, the collision between our two galaxies has already started.Andromeda and our Milky Way on collision course.When the galaxies do meet, it will make for a pretty sight from earth. On approach, the Andromeda galaxy will warp the band of the Milky Way across our sky. Eventually, the galaxies' cores will merge. However, by then, there will be no one on earth to see this sight.It already has happened. Ten billion years ago another, smaller galaxy collided with our Milky Way. Again, stars did not smash into each other but the galaxies passed through each other like ghosts. In time, the smaller galaxy was pulled in and joined the Milky Way with new, alien stars and gas. And it happened again with a dwarf galaxy four billion years ago. So Andromeda will not be the first galaxy to collide with ours but it will be the largest. It’s 50% larger than our Milky Way.","1,893 followers",Sarah Ameri,119K,151,2.9M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-upcoming-mind-blowing-technology-that-can-be-seen-in-2021

Inventions are being made that blow our minds off but the next ten years may be the greatest of all. The technologies being made will make it easier and faster to accomplish most of our day to day activities. Innovative ideas are increasing exponentially each year and to give you a peak into what changes we will have seen by the year 2020, here is a list of 10 amazing innovations that will change different sectors of our lives in a huge way;1. A plane that canDiscoveries are made every day, and some of the things we consider science fiction in most epic movies are being turned into realities. Inventions are being made that blow our minds off but the next ten years may be the greatest of all. The technologies being made will make it easier and faster to accomplish most of our day to day activities. Innovative ideas are increasing exponentially each year and to give you a peak into what changes we will have seen by the year 2020, here is a list of 10 amazing innovations that will change different sectors of our lives in a huge way;1. A plane that can fly anywhere in the world in 4 hoursThe British aerospace firm Reaction Engines is working on a plane that can fly anywhere in the world for just four hours. The plane will also to fly in outer space. In the video, chief Engineer Alan Bond explained that air entering the new “Sabre” engine system could be cooled by more than 1,000 degrees Celsius in .01 seconds. The cooling rate will be at 400 megawatts and will allow the plane to “breathe” oxygen. That ability would allow a jet engine to run at higher power than what is possible today. More power equals more speed and therefore the plane will be able to fly at 5 times the speed of sound very easily. (Alan Bond Interview - (Reaction Engines Ltd)2. Personal assistantsSoon, everyone will have a PA since artificial intelligence assistants will be making a proper entrance. Guile 3D Studio has developed an amazing AI assistant known as Denise. Once you install Denise to your computer, it is able to execute tasks on your behalf by either speaking or typing your request. Denise is able to check and send emails, manage your diary in case of meetings and appointments, draw up itineraries, search the web, give you the day’s weather forecast, call someone on Skype, give you the day’s news, upload videos on YouTube, upload images on Picasa and so much more. (3.DARPA has an innovation underway for veterans with upper limb loss. The artificial limb moves like the real thing and will do just about anything. One can play the piano, pick a cup and sip coffee with it. It gives back natural hand movement and weighs as much as a normal arm. It also looks pretty close to the real arm except for the fact that it’s made of metal. The arm is directed by the brain just like a human arm. (4. Interaction changeOur interaction with people and things has changed over the years due to the internet, smart phones etc. But that’s not all; in the near future a huge change will be made in the way we interact with surroundings. You will be able to look at a building or place and get the information on the subject using just your eyes. Goggles by Google have an early concept of this idea which is an app that allows you to take a picture of an object and immediately receive information about it on your android phone.According to Ray Kurzweil, a top futurist, “5. Jetpack technologyJet pack international has made great strides in their jet pack technology H202 and H202-Z jet packs. This hydrogen peroxide fueled jet packs will allow users to fly at 77 miles per hour and at a maximum height of 250 ft for the H202-Z while the H202 will allow users to fly at a speed of 70 miles per hour at a maximum height of 250ft. (6. Energyanotechnology is currently being used to design renewable energy technologies like solar energy. According to Kurzweil, “Sandia Solar Cells have come close to achieving this since they are made of 100 times less material than that of the current solar cells, operating at the same efficiency. Current panels are heavy and massive and require large motors to track them when tracking the sun. Sandia’s cell on the other hand only needs to be moved a fraction of a millimeter for it to track the sun efficiently and it weighs close to nothing. (7. Estimote beaconsEstimote Beacons are small beautifully designed sensors that can be placed anywhere in the world. When you install them, either on a product shelf or next to a door, they start broadcasting tiny radio signals that can be picked up by smart phones. The app then triggers different actions like welcoming customers to a store, helping customers navigate the store and displaying coupons. (8. HealthInvetech, an Australian engineering firm, has teamed up with Organovo, a medical company, to produce a 3-D bio-printer that can fabricate organs to order. The device builds up organs a layer of cells at a time and uses the different cells based on the recipients own body. This significantly lowers the chances of organ rejection. For the more complex organs, the printer lays the cells over a pre-made scaffold. The printer is still in its early testing phase but the companies believe that within five years, they will be able to print out veins and arteries for bypass surgery and within 10 years for complex organs like the liver and heart. (9. RobotsThe 21st century has seen remarkable innovation in robotics. Though we are yet to make them help around the house or do our construction, there have been big strides that point towards a better future. The University of California, San Diego, used the self guided learning process to make a hyper-realistic Einstein robot smile and make facial expressions.Boston Dynamics have a biped robot that dynamically balances using a human-like walking motion. (Also see:10.Amazon has a project that will have drones fly packages directly to your doorstep in 30 minutes. The plan, according to Jeff Bezos, Amazon CEO, requires more safety testing and approvals from the FAA but he estimates the ‘octocopter’ drones will be available to customers in 4 to 5 years. The drones will deliver your package 30 minutes after you hit “buy” on Amazon.com. (Source11. ClothingNano technologists are working on making clothes more comfortable to wear. According to Prof Ashwini Agarwal of Delhi IIT,Fiber based nanotechnology is also being used to harvest energy from physical movement. The “power shirt” will be able to generate electricity that can power small electronic devices for soldiers, hikers and others whose physical motion can be harnessed and converted to electrical energy. (12. Cars and fuelThe Aptera 2e Electric carWe already have hybrid vehicles on the road but the electric cars sound promising too.13. ComputersAccording to a prediction by““To this end, semiconductor giants such as Intel, IBM, HP and others are looking to build ever-smaller silicon circuits for use on processors and communications interfaces, paving the way for smaller, faster, more power-efficient computer systems and other devices.”Intel corp researchers also predict that by the year 2020, you won’t need a keyboard or mouse to control the computer. Users will use brain waves to open documents and surf the Web.14.Manchester based animator, Richard Ramchum is the founder of the #Scanners Cinema experience that will allow everyone to watch a film differently. Viewers are supposed to wear a headset that reads brainwaves. The headset then manipulates images one sees according to their subconscious mind. In this way, edit points will be created and the narrative changed when one blinks. It will give people a glimpse into their dream world since the film one sees will be a visual record of your subconscious mind.

I pay for my own insurance, keep a roof over my family’s head, keep food in the fridge and take a vacation every couple years or so.So, yes, I can make a ‘living’ trading.Can you?Probably not.And I say that with the most utter and supreme confidence that I can muster. There are very few things I am absolutely certain about - butWhy?Because it is nearly impossible. Listen - most people have absolutely no idea what kind of a mind f**k trading is. Literally - almost no one does. I’ve met 5 total independent traders like me - and I’m about the most normal one out of that 5. The others are just phenomenal traders, gods among men, its magic what they can do - but they are each of them a wreck of a human being. They’ve lost their families and their sanity. They’ve experienced such psychological and emotional suffering from their journey to profitability that they are forever blessed and cursed from that journey.Trading will ruin you. If, by the grace of God, you survive trading and becoming profitable, you won’t be the same. You will be forever changed in both your mood and your mannerisms. YouTrading is the antithesis of normal human behavior because, in order to make money, you have to risk the thing that keeps a roof over your head, food in your belly, clothes on your back and provides those things for your family as well - you have to risk your money.I got lucky. I have the most amazing and supportive wife in the world. I try to remember to tell folks that my ability to be a profitable trader, my journey to profitability, the results I currently have - it’s a partnership between me and my wife.I can not tell you what kind of sh*t she had to put up with or the anxiety and pain I put our family through so thatSo I got lucky. I suffered horrible shame and self-loathing after blowing two large accounts - all of my life savings because I am a God-damned idiot. But my wife knew my passion and knew I was good at it, I just had to tackle the things that were limiting my ability to be profitable.But to your question? No - you don’t make a living as a day trader.Day trading is a lifestyle - it’s part of who I am, it’s a constant and as much a part of my soul as anything else in my life. I am constantly connected to the market and aware of it - even while asleep. It’s the thing I go to bed excited about at night and its the thing that makes me wake up excited every morning. It’s the thing I do from 5 AM to 9 PM because I love it.But I will tell you right now -UPDATE FOR COMMENTS BELOW (Feb. 17th, 2019)First, I am very humbled by the words from folks who have gone through the same hell I’ve gone through to do what I love to do.

You need to learn the concept of accumulation and distribution.AccumulationAccumulation happens when market movers slowly accumulate in a stock before a positive news or result is leaked and the big move happens. Accumulation simply means buying in huge qty without letting price increase much.DistributionDistribution happens when the market movers know of an upcoming bad news after which the fall happens. Distribution simply means selling in huge qty without letting price decrease significantly.Now question on your mind would be how to identify accumulation and distributionYes you can find accumulation distribution usingBelow is the tool I wrote which exactly does this for me gave me price volume breakout and OBV divergence on higher timeframe gave signs of accumulation.This is how Divergence looks likeThis is how price volume action gave aThe stock price moved from 350 to 680 in 2 months.If you combine price volume action with Divergence you would have an edge.Making money from stock market is all about having a strategy that gives you an edge and fortunately this strategy is here to stay as market movers continue to accumulate and distribute👍Happy Investing !!!",6 followers,Ryan Burner,1.6K,0,0,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-upcoming-mind-blowing-technology-that-can-be-seen-in-2021

In those games, it’s possible to discover algorithms that will defeat everyone else.With the stock market, there are lots and lots of well-funded enterprises focused on using computers to ‘game’ the stock market.Consider a technique in use today: one of the big ‘cheat methods’ is high speed trading. A system is able to make extremely short-term predictions, because other trades are done by regular humans. Those human trades produce a trend, and the high speed system sees it and profits off it before that system’s own activity can negate that trend.It would work perfectly if yours was the only high speed trading system doing trades. You’d simply take easy advantage of all the slow human traders, and your profits would rise endlessly.But there are many enterprises using high speed trading systems. As a result, the market has come to respond faster and faster, as the trades themselves become faster. In order to be profitable, these high speed systems have to be faster than their peers. It’s a bit of an arms race, and the profits are less fantastic.Now consider DeepMind and other AI projects.Suppose DeepMind comes up with an algorithm to predict the stock market. It would be in the same position as the first high speed trading system. It could simply bet on its predictions, and rake in the cash.But of course, DeepMind will not be alone. Other AI systems are also being designed to make predictions. And as the owners of those systems profit off of the predictions, they alter the behavior of the market.Consider two AI systems that predict a certain stock is about to shoot sky high. If the owner of one of those systems pours their money into that stock, they will cause a devaluation of that stock. Instead of shooting sky high it then may make only modest gains. So the other AI system, which made the same prediction as the first, now has to see its own predictionThis is how all of the predictive AIs will be. As they act on their predictions, they will change the behavior of the stock market.Soon, it will no longer be enough to make predictions based on human activity — the AIs will need to base their predictions on the nature and behaviors of the other AIs trying to game the system. And of course, those other AIs will be trying to do the same thing, all of them trying to predict the behaviors of all the others.You can see how impossible this is. If one AI has a million i9 processors running its algorithm, how could it hope to predict the behavior of another AI thatIt couldn’t be done. You can’t have a smaller system successfully predicting the behaviors of a much larger system, when that larger system’sSo we will have another ‘arms race’. Instead of pure speed, the new race will be sheer numbers of CPUs.Imagine warehouses filled with millions upon millions of running systems, all programmed with software designed to utilize their vast processing power as a single computational system. I’m describing a situation that already exists in the world. Many thousands of these warehouses exist right now. This particular arms race has long been under way.TheThe real problem is that those systems do make tremendous gains,The result will continue to be what we’ve been seeing for many years now — a small class of supremely wealthy people who get wealthier and wealthier at a relatively high rate; a second much larger group of poor people who continue to lose whatever they have, due to the rich people grabbing up all the wealth; and a third group — the human investors — who may actually make some small amount of profit, and see their own holdings go up, but only at the cost of feeding an even greater share of those profits into the hands of that small group of wealthy people.At some point it becomes necessary to recognize that capitalism — yes, I said the word — simply doesn’t work.It may have worked well at small scales, hundreds of years ago, with small businesses earning enough to support the families that ran them. But now, it has revealed many of its fatal flaws.One main problem is: there is no good way to prevent a small group of people from simply owning everything. And however much one may love capitalism, one has to at least admit that if it allows a small group of people to own everything, it’s not functioning properly.Another main problem is: there is no good way to prevent the profit motive from destroying the world. The whole problem with fossil fuels ruining the environment is purely and simply due to the profit motive. They need to sell all that oil. And they will do whatever they have to, to get people to buy it. And now here we are, in a situation where it’s extremely difficult to change our energy consuming habits — exactly what the energy companies wanted and aimed for! However much one may love capitalism, if it destroys the viability of one’s planet, it’s not functioning properly.It’s important to do away with great wealth. We’ve seen what the profit motive will lead us to. We must re-empower governments to do what they were intended to do in the first place — help everyone! That’s the literal goal of human government. To just help everyone. We’re supposed to pay taxes into a large system that will then use those taxes to help us. People who earn more money, instead of keeping it all, should have to pay most of it into the government, to support all of those socialized programs.I certainly don’t see any",0 followers,Prakarsh Gagdani,650,1.8K,39.1M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-upcoming-mind-blowing-technology-that-can-be-seen-in-2021

He’s one of the richest people on earth, with 73.3 billion dollars of net worth.He started investing at the age of 11, and now he’s 86 years old.Here you can see the members of the 27 club.They gave the world incredible pieces of art, and all of them died in their 27th year of life.A few years ago, at the middle of my 20’s, back when 27 seemed to be a looong way away ; my mentality to money and investing was ‘’You have to earn it young, when you’re still able to enjoy it!’’.Then I saw this chart :Look at how much money he had at the age Jimi Hendrix was having orgies and touring the world.Only 140,000 dollars! (That’s actually a lot of money for that age, my net worth is much lower, but compared to Warren’s contemporary net worth it’s peanuts!)Seeing this graph made me fully understand the power of compound interest.As long as you keep on doing what you love to do, your money and your talents just keep building on top of each other, and withAnd it’s not just true for Warren, when you look at the net worth of the world’s richest people, you can see that modest gains each year add up, here’s the stock chart for Amazon :You can see that it really became a super-power just a few years ago, with the momentum getting stronger and stronger.So compound interest and patient momentum are your best friends.But of course we don’t want you to get too bored, trading stocks should also have the kind of risk that sometimes tickles your sexual organs and make you learn lessons the tough hard way.I’m recommending a way of trading that gives you both patience and bullish adventure.I just started managing $10,000 of my family’s money with it 3 months ago, and so far our portfolio is up %62:(Of course it’s the long term that matters, but so far so good.)PART I : Finding Stocks You LoveIf you’re looking for success with trading stocks, I hope you love to read.And not just books, but magazines, the patient information forms that come out of medicine boxes, writings on toilet cubicles, subtitles in foreign films, tattoos on people’s bodies…You have to absolutely love reading to invest.Books are fine, but these days most of the information you need is on the internet.The first thing you do, before even opening a brokerage account, is research which stocks you want to trade.Here are some of the best and most interesting places to learn about which stocks are the ones for you :The Motley Fool :Zacks :Investor’s Business Daily :Yahoo Finance :My favorite is Yahoo Finance. I know the company and the rest of the website is old-fashioned, but when it comes to finance they are #1.I trade on the American stock market, if you just want to stay local maybe this answer can help :Read through stocks, I’m sure you’re going to recognize some companies that you already know about.Even better, write about some companies that are in your life and meet their alter-ego’s, the stock!If you love Nike sneakers, check out the NKE symbol.If you ate at Pizza Hut or Taco Bell last weekend, look at it’s parent companies stock YUM.(Stock symbols, some of them will make you laugh and some will even be like book covers, maybe influencing you a bit too much during the buying decision, but that’s part of the fun of being human.)When starting out, it’s good to start with stocks of companies that add value to your life, so you can build upon an existing relationship. (The second part of my strategy, the more bullish adventure part, can be with any company, we’ll be talking about it soon.)For me, here are the 3 stocks I started with 3 months ago :SHOPBABASODADo your research and find stocks that excite both your wallet and your soul / brain.If this answer gets enough upvotes, I’ll edit it and add what technical details you should check off before buying a stock, in a while I’m going to eat some ice cream with my dad and still have part 2 to write :Part II : Where the real money isStocks are great, but are you ready to enter the matrix?Thanks to modern day civilization, you don’t have to own a stock to trade it.There is something called a stock option, and most (if not all) stocks also have an options chain. Here is how one looks :This is the option chain for Alibaba (BABA), today is 2 days before earnings and things are looking good, so the options are generating huge amounts of cash.Basically, an option is when you believe a stock is going to rise or fall to xxx by a certain date, so you pay money to buy / sell it at xxx at that certain date.Let’s look at the topmost option and you’re going to understand real quick :121.00 BABA170519C00121000 4.85 4.85 4.90 1.46 43.07 % 1,869 3,632 66.82 %This is a 19 May call option today (16th of May), which means it’s a bullish option, believing the stock will rise by the expiration date of 19 May. (At the bottom you can see the beginning of Puts, which are bearish, believing the stock will fall till the same date.)Today you can pay 4.85 dollars to be able to buy a share of Alibaba at a price of 121.00 dollars by Friday.If earnings goes well and Alibaba goes up to 130 dollars, then you can buy it for 121 and sell it for 130 dollars, giving you a revenue of 9 dollars, minus the 4.85 you paid for an almost %100 profit in a week.Incredible, isn’t it!You can see the call option with a strike price of 145 dollars has risen %1000 in a single day, a return on investment of 10 times in ONE DAY!Of course options are incredibly risky, as you can see from the current options in my portfolio :Look at the one on the bottom, OCLR 19 May Call, and you can see that I’ve lost all of my money, 327 dollars.I bought this option a few months ago when the semi-conductor sector was hot and it seemed it would last forever. (It didn’t, except NVDA most semi stocks have lost their momentum..)You should be buying options only when you have analyzed the previous quarterly reports, stock chart for momentum, investor sentiments and your own gut feelings.By buying companies that you love and want to partner with ; and also options before earnings for short term growth and adventure ; you’ll have a great time.I recommend that you open an Ameritrade account and trade stocks in the U.S, as information is the most valuable thing for you and emerging market countries like India and my own Turkey are a bit short on information.This leads to stock market manipulation where individual investors like you and me are in the dark. (My ex-girlfriend’s dad was one of the most influential traders in the Turkish stock exchange and I witnessed the deals and monopolies they created to move prices and then dump stocks.)And don’t forget, don’t risk too much of your money for a single trade, be patient and don’t day trade, this should be a hobby.Otherwise you’re not adding value to the world, it’s much better if you’re busy %80 of the time with your own company / job that one day could go public.But as far as hobbies go, this is one of the best.",0 followers,Stock Price,718,0,0,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-upcoming-mind-blowing-technology-that-can-be-seen-in-2021

That would mean that if you'd lose money you can't stop nor if you earn, you aren't able to set aside your winnings.Trying to find an edge, and see it works is mildly addictive, but to such an extent that if I earn $1k or $10k with an idea, the pleasure is all the same.You saw an opportunity you thought others didn't see, you jumped in and executed it perfectly, that, that right there is the joy.
