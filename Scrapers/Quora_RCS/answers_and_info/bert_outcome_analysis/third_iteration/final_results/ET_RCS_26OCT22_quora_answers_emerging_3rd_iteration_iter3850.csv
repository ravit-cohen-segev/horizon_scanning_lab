0,"Although WW2 was a war of mobility (in the West), there were also areas, particularly in the East that were very reminiscent of WW1. Many German authors write of fighting conditions on the Eastern Front that were reminiscent of WW1. In the winter the Germans tried to hunker down because full scale combat was so difficult that the Germans were forced onto the defensive. In those cases there would be miles of trenches and barbed wire, dug-in bunkers with log rooves and cave in hillsides.

Many German authors write of fighting conditions on the Eastern Front that were reminiscent of WW1. In the winter the Germans tried to hunker down because full scale combat was so difficult that the Germans were forced onto the defensive. In those cases there would be miles of trenches and barbed wire, dug-in bunkers with log rooves and cave in hillsides. Deep trenches were often the only thing that stood between life and death during artillery barrages and minefields were laid wide and deep. Only snipers and reconaissance patrols would move through no-man's land where life could be measured in minutes and taken by a sniper. Probing attacks using mortar and long range artillery were constant reminders and Russian ""sewing machines"", Rata biplane aircraft would drop small iron bombs on the Germans to harass them. It was very much like WW1.When winter combat was required it took a super-human effort to simply get to the starting line and  battles raged during blizzards for a few kilometers of ground and for the remaining buildings that might be able to provide some measure of protection from the elements. During the springtime, offensive operations were hampered by thick, glutinous mud that would pluck a soldier's boots from his feet. One thing that is not often talked about is the impact of thousands of soldiers and vehicles on even paved roads. After a few hours of pounding boots, metal tracks and tires, any road would be either cratered or reduced to a wide, rutted mud pit. Horses died pulling artillery, the number one cause of death for horses in the German Army was heart failure from overwork. Tanks would have to be diverted from combat operations to rescue other vehicles and sledges and sleds were often the only way anything moved. The Germans dedicated over a million men to simply building and maintaining rail lines through Russia, which used a different guage train than the Germans.  Often the Germans had to rip up and re-guage the width of thousands of miles of track or use captured stock and engines at marshalling yards. Frieght yards, rail embankments, and stations all became incredibly strategic for both sides and combat raged for important rail junctions. The battle of Rhzev was a case in point, it  was critical for both the Germans and the Russians. The Russians were able to take advantage of partisans who would blow rail lines while the Germans invented special bombs with a spike at the tip that would impact rail embankments and allow explosives to explode at just the right height to damage rail lines. Both the Germans and Russians became expert at restoring rails damaged in battle. One story relates how a bomb attack destroys a few hundred yards of track and so every soldier on the train has to go out, rebuild the embankment, re-lay and replace the sleepers and lay new rail carried as spares on the train cars so they can move on in just a few hours. Obviously it was more difficult to re-build bridges.On the Russian steppes, war was of mobility, who could outflank the other first and fastest. The Russians, in particular, became expert at building rings of anti-tank defenses with various caliber anti=tank guns. The Germans, for their part, would try to race around anti-tank defenses or use infantry to break them up with mortar or artillery fire. The Germans used  particular howitzer that they could manhandle in any terrain to attack fortified anti-tank defenses. At Kursk in particular the Germans were unsuccessful at defeating the defenses in depth of the Russian anti-tank defenses. Hitler's multiple delays in starting the battle while waiting for more powerful tanks to be ready ensured the Russians had all the time they needed to prepare the battlefield to their advantage. Large scale artillery attacks, fighter bombers and strafing, movement by infantry under good conditions were not sufficient and the Germans lost large numbers of tanks as a result. Despite this, once the Germans actually achieved some level of momentum and success seemed within their grasp, Hitler called off the attack because of the Allied invation of Sicily and Italy. It was a bitter defeat for the Germans after Stalingrad, a battle that could have been won albeit at an enormous and pyhric cost.After D-Day the Allies strove to avoid trench warfare and depended heavily on their ability to move men and equipment quickly towards whatever objective they desired. Although the Germans had the men and material to stop the Allies initially, their troops were poorly deployed and despite heroic efforts by indivual units and men the Germans were forced to pull back again and again despite a few local victories. Battles were fought in villages and towns, something that didn't often happen in WW1, but artillery still played a major role. Crossroads were frequently targetted, But it was the Allied air power that really made things difficult for the Germans. German fighter support was seen less and less as the war went on and the Americans pounded freight yards, German marshalling areas and supply depots with devastating effects. The Germans could only move at night or in bad weather and rail schedules became a thing of the past. Nevertheless, many authors tell of supplies being available right up til the end of the war, usually of lesser quality but in sufficient numbers to keep them moving. In the book ""Panzer Commander"" the author tells of increasingly frequent fuel shortages but he is never stranded for want of fuel and while the food became blander the calorie count remained sufficient in the West.Battles in the West also included fighting in places like the Huertgen Forest for which there is no comparable battle in WW1. It was considered some of the most bitter fighting of the war and both sides fought desperately. In the book ""Victory Was Beyond Their Grasp"" the bitter struggle of the 272nd Volfs Grenadier Battalion is described, and how they are unable to dislodge the Americans despite constant desperate attacks because the VGD were set up to fight defensive battles but were thrust into offensive roles without the necessary troops. Americans, for their part, talk bitterly of entire American tank battalions turning and running as soon as a few German tanks appear, leaving the infantry to face them alone, or of shell-shocked Americans refusing to move forward, en masse, almost total desertion in the face of the enemy because of the constant German attacks. Both the Germans and the Americans used white phosphorous and fragmentation, firing into the tree tops to create splinters and falling limbs. The weather was cold and men were forced to live outside for days with no relief. Ultimately, the Germans blew the dam and held up the American advance for a few weeks but the collapse of Model's army was all but assured.In Holland it was a bitter war where both sides fought viciously and the ground was so devastated by artillery fire that the drainage system was destroyed making Allied advances almost impossible. The Germans held out right til the end in many places, allowing the E-boats to remain effective in sinking Allied ships right up to the last days of the war. Antwerp was also the target of V-2 attacks. While WW1 was marked by large scale artillery barrages followed by tens of thousands of men charging through no-man's land, WW2 was more of a truck-moved army using mobile artillery and large, but smaller and more targetted artillery barrages. Unlike WW1 the Germans were forced to make the choice of having to bomb their own towns and villages when the Allies moved in and this was a heart-rending decision for them. While they tried to move civilians out of harm's way this was not often possible and the Germans were often forced to unleash artillery barrages on their own towns, something that rarely if ever happened in WW1.In Silesia the Germans fought a desperate and tenacious and ultimately useless war against vastly superior Russian forces and often prevailed for a time. The story of Dora II, the German tank-hunting unit that was armed only with explosives and moved by bicycle is legendary. In just three days they destroy 107 Russian tanks with just 47 men near the Seelow Heights. Because the rail lines were critical, the Germans fought a desperate battle for Lauban and prevailed. The descriptions of the pointless and desperate combat in the book ""To the Bitter End"" underscores the professionalism of the German soldier to the last day, and the idiocy and blindness of the German leadership who demanded more and more. German coal mines delivered 16,000 tons of coal right up til the last day of the war, despite combat even in the mines themselves. German railroads ran supplies to the army and removed the wounded and civilians right up til the end. The Germans were even able to mount co-ordinated echelon blitzkrieg attacks with Luftwaffe fighter support in a few cases, just two days before the end, re-capturing a few key railroad crossings.In the Kourland Peninsula warfare was more like WW1, with strings of trenches and outposts of wooden forts and barriers, with defense in depth using machine guns and artillery, since there were few tanks and less gasoline, and very few fighters. In the end, a 100 plane evacuation of the Kourland Front of the wounded and older men with children was crushed when almost every plane was shot down by the Russians. In the area around Memel, some of the worst fighting in recorded history was fought, where men were changed forever and where everyone, men, women and children were drawn into the combat. Breslau held out til the very last day of the war, the  casualties and conditions were horrific. There is no parallel from WW1.In the South, the Germans launched a major offensive against the Russians around Budapest to relieve the city and the large number of Germans and loyal Hungarians encircled there. The battle raged in bad weather for months, a war of mobility and tactics where the deciding factor for the Germans was the mud, the lack of gasoline and the paucity of artillery shells. The Germans trapped in Budapest listened with hope as the batte raged only a dozen miles away but they were cut in two by the Russians and unable to fight their way out. In the end less than 40 German soldiers made their way back to German lines and the Germans collapsed around Vienna, surrendering to the Americans while a rear guard held off the Russians in s suicidal gesture that saw every single one of them killed. There was nothing like it in WW1.In Italy the Germans used the terrain to break up American mobility and were successful right up til the end, but once the back of the German defense lines were breached, a 600,000 man German army ran like hell through the Po Valley and tried to make it back to Germany, burning everything in the wake until Vietingoff surrendered two or three days before Germany did. That kind of retreat was rarely seen in WW1 and the advances the Americans made -- just 19 days from the Po Valley to the Alps, was reminiscent only of the beginning the German attack during Operation Michael in WW1, which ultimately ground to a halt, unlike the Allies in WW2 who simply captured the entire German Army intact.I think that covers the West. The war with Japan was different, predicated on sea warfare. On land it was a war of attrition. In ""With the Old Breed"", Sledge tells of WW1-like conditions where American Marines are trapped in trenches, shitting in metal food tins and living in trenches filled with water and human shit and getting trench foot, just like WW1, and of GIs getting their heads blown off by snipers at night when they light up a cigarrette. In this way, the war for the islands was often more like WW1 than Europe was. Also, the Japanese would frequently attack in banzai fashion despite the certainty that they would be cut down by machine guns, just as troops did in WW1.Jungle warfare was different, more guerrilla style and where the bigger enemy was disease and where the Japanese often had to be burned out with flame throwers. The casualties were horrific on both sides, and possibly more reminiscent of WW1.","29,928 followers",Tomaž Vargazon,1.6K,7.7K,249.7M,2015,https://www.quora.com/WW1-was-mostly-trench-warfare-What-were-battlefields-like-in-WW2-I-know-trench-warfare-didnt-happen-due-to-more-advanced-technology-but-what-were-the-areas-of-battle-like-Where-they-on-fields-towns-or-hills-What-were-the-frontlines-between-the-two-sides

Waterloo, Gettysburg, and Bastogne certainly share the fact that they all took place at a convergence of roads which were important for getting the armies involved to the battle site in the first place.What is most remarkable to me is the difference in all of these. In short, each one was progressively larger. I was able to walk all of the key points of Waterloo in a couple of hours. It was really quite compact.Gettysburg was somewhat larger. I drove between a couple of key points but was able to tour the whole battlefield and walked large parts of it, particularly Little Round Top and Pickett's Charge, in half a day.Vimy might have been the exception to the idea of ever increasing size as it was relatively compact but, then again, I only walked the central part of the battlefield.I spent most of a day exploring Juno Beach and Pegasus Bridge but never got anywhere near Sword, Gold, Omaha, or Utah Beaches, much less the majority of the Airborne landing areas. I suspect I would have needed a full day on each of them.I spent all day poking around Bastogne and feel like I barely scratched the surface. Remember that Bastogne was just a small portion of the Battle of the Bulge.At Waterloo regiments with muskets stood shoulder to shoulder to concentrate their fire making up for a lack of accuracy with weight of fire. That one battle was decisive and ended a war and, potentially, a reinvigorated French Empire. At Bastogne, infantry were spread out to cover long lines with efficient and accurate weapons. The failure of the German attack, and the success of the Allied defense, was just another stepping stone with more fighting to come.The scope of battle, which is a product of the efficiency of arms and transportation, had grown exponentially  as demonstrated by these two battles fought 130 years, and only about 140 Km/85 miles, apart.","1,194 followers",Daan Verbaan,799,348,1.6M,2016,https://www.quora.com/WW1-was-mostly-trench-warfare-What-were-battlefields-like-in-WW2-I-know-trench-warfare-didnt-happen-due-to-more-advanced-technology-but-what-were-the-areas-of-battle-like-Where-they-on-fields-towns-or-hills-What-were-the-frontlines-between-the-two-sides

Then the front-line troops had to halt to rest and resupply.Getting the supplies and artillery forward took another 48 to 72 hours.These 2–3 days in which the logistics tried to catch up was usually enough time for the enemy to mass enough troops for a counterattack and take back their lost positions.During the Hundred Day Offensive that ended the War, the Germans were no longer capable of massing enough troops for a counterattack, but the Allied advance was the same: advance, hold, resupply.On the Eastern Front, the terrain was better and the area larger making it more difficult to organize a counterattack and easier for logistics to keep up.During World War Two, the same problem occurred in Italy where logistics couldn’t keep up either, even with trucks and tanks.Once the troops advance too quickly, there was also a halt in World War Two. The capacity to move supplies and artillery was better and troops could advance further before they ran out of supplies. But it also took much longer to move the supplies.When the Allies broke out of the Normandy beachhead, they could advance for 6 weeks and then needed roughly 3 months to resupply. But the principle was the same: advance, hold, resupply.On the Eastern Front, after Operation Bagration which lasted 8 weeks, the Soviets needed to halt to resupply which took roughly 5 months.It is all about the ability to move your supplies.","15,083 followers",Jason Almendra,919,21.3K,105.4M,2021,https://www.quora.com/WW1-was-mostly-trench-warfare-What-were-battlefields-like-in-WW2-I-know-trench-warfare-didnt-happen-due-to-more-advanced-technology-but-what-were-the-areas-of-battle-like-Where-they-on-fields-towns-or-hills-What-were-the-frontlines-between-the-two-sides

In addition, the Incas had developed a method of storing information by the knotting of robes, and because of where they were situated also were experts and making rope bridges and made some spectacular monuments.",4 followers,Cem Arslan,3.3K,1.6K,36.3M,2020,https://www.quora.com/WW1-was-mostly-trench-warfare-What-were-battlefields-like-in-WW2-I-know-trench-warfare-didnt-happen-due-to-more-advanced-technology-but-what-were-the-areas-of-battle-like-Where-they-on-fields-towns-or-hills-What-were-the-frontlines-between-the-two-sides
12,"I’ll go with the Inca. Both civilizations were incredible architects and astronomers/mathematicians. Neither of them had the wheel (how counter-intuitive is that?!). But the Inca also were fabulous water engineers, constructing elaborate gravity-driven systems to bring water from miles away to the cities and irrigated fields where it was needed. Even today, many of the these water systems remain in place and flowing among the Inca archaeological sites open to visitors.",0 followers,Henrey Bradley,740,390,32.9M,2020,https://www.quora.com/WW1-was-mostly-trench-warfare-What-were-battlefields-like-in-WW2-I-know-trench-warfare-didnt-happen-due-to-more-advanced-technology-but-what-were-the-areas-of-battle-like-Where-they-on-fields-towns-or-hills-What-were-the-frontlines-between-the-two-sides
13,"The Aztec empire is older. By about ten years.The Aztec triple alliance, an association of three city states in central Mexico, was established in 1428. Over time, it moved in the direction of being an empire under the growing control of Tenochtitlan. The Inca empire was established in 1438, developing from the kingdom of Cusco. In other words, the period of their founding corresponds to the very end of the Middle Ages in Europe or perhaps the very early Renaissance.There’s no global yardstick for technological sophistication.

Both were roughly equivalent in architecture, agricultural productivity, and various other endeavors. I suppose that if I had to pick one, I’d lean towards the Inca, who had somewhat better metallurgy than the Aztec, producing more complex gold/silver/copper alloys.","29,928 followers",Tomaž Vargazon,1K,7.7K,249.7M,2020,https://www.quora.com/WW1-was-mostly-trench-warfare-What-were-battlefields-like-in-WW2-I-know-trench-warfare-didnt-happen-due-to-more-advanced-technology-but-what-were-the-areas-of-battle-like-Where-they-on-fields-towns-or-hills-What-were-the-frontlines-between-the-two-sides
14,"It depends what you mean by advanced, there is no evidence of electrical power tools or light bulbs for example.The Egyptians had some technologies that fell out of use for a few millennia, examples include penicillin from mouldy bread, plywood and (meteoric) iron in the bronze age.The Minoans had optical lenses made from precision ground rock-crystals, lodestones (compasses), murex dyes, may have had used composite materials for ship-hulls and according to myth created a Palace door for Baal that opened by fire (steam).There are not many technologies that fall out of use to be rediscovered laIt depends what you mean by advanced, there is no evidence of electrical power tools or light bulbs for example.The Egyptians had some technologies that fell out of use for a few millennia, examples include penicillin from mouldy bread, plywood and (meteoric) iron in the bronze age.The Minoans had optical lenses made from precision ground rock-crystals, lodestones (compasses), murex dyes, may have had used composite materials for ship-hulls and according to myth created a Palace door for Baal that opened by fire (steam).There are not many technologies that fall out of use to be rediscovered later, these are a few rare examples. The Egyptians were excellent early chemists, the Minoans are good at what we would call today material science and engineering.","14,230 followers",Saran Udayakumar,10.1K,1K,29.3M,2020,https://www.quora.com/WW1-was-mostly-trench-warfare-What-were-battlefields-like-in-WW2-I-know-trench-warfare-didnt-happen-due-to-more-advanced-technology-but-what-were-the-areas-of-battle-like-Where-they-on-fields-towns-or-hills-What-were-the-frontlines-between-the-two-sides
