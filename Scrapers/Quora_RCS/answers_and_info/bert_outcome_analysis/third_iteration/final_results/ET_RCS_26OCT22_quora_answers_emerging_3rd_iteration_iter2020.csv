0,"In my view, this is not politicised. Anything great is delivered by the prime minister of the country. It has been witnessed by people of India since Nehru period.Oppositions should not politicise the issue as the honorable PM hasn't said it is happened because of BJP government.

Every side wants to put their best foot forward and sometimes they dump too much on the unsuspecting people. The only one who is gaining in this political season are the news channels that have 24 hour wall-to-wall coverage of all the parties and their ever changing narratives.Thanks for the A2A",13 followers,Nikhil Chauhan,761,71,1.5M,2019,https://www.quora.com/India-develops-the-technology-to-hit-enemy-satellites-do-you-think-this-development-will-affect-the-upcoming-election-results

Forget about something betterTo Leapfrog we need toOtherwise we may as well keep using their Technology and continuing to do hair cutting services like we do today like Deliver Food, Clean Latrines, Run Tuition Classes, Sell Chicken and Mutton and Run Taxis.What is our Technological Base?Do we have a Single Technological Edge in what we are Developing Today?Our Designs - Maybe innovative but absolutely modelled around Design Basics developed by the West.Our Software- Again - entirely modelled around Western Fundamentals - C/C++ or Java.Our Aerodynamics - Again -entirely modelled on what Germany or USA or recently China was doing 5 - 10 years ago.Where do you develop a Technological Base for an Edge?In the Institutions and SchoolsDo we have these? Absolutely not.How many Students want to do Research? How many Students want to Study further and develop further in their disciplines?They either want to go to USA and make money or become Haircutting Saloon CEOs inflating their worth and bragging and boastingHow many Intelligent People come into teaching?In US , China etc - Researchers also Teach and in that way the Cream of the Crop teaches Students and helps them develop.Our Professors are mainly “Teachers” rather than “Researchers”. We rarely have this concept of Researchers Teaching Students. So most of the Professors are ordinary people who certainly cannot help students develop or achieve their potential. Rather they can help students getIn SchoolsHow many Academic Programs do we have for the Advanced Students?Government Scholarships?Instead we haveHow many Teachers exist to build and develop students to achieve their Potential? 1%, 2%???My wife is a Teacher and let me tell you - Her purpose is 100% Pass.Thats the Zenith of achievement. The Principal sends 20 Whatsapp messages sayingPlus Reservations!!!!How can you ever Develop a Technological Base?????So without a Technological Base, we cannot Create new TechnologiesWithout Creating New Technologies, We depend on Other TechnologySo now lets see if we can at least Adapt and Improvise other Technology?The Chinese were once Masters at This.Now they have moved to trying to create their own TechnologyLike the EM Catapult for the Liaoning ACC. Its a Basic Design that has been modified and adapted in a revolutionary manner as to evenWe dont even do this todayWe take Technology from the West (Or Russia) and use them on an as is where is basis.Take BrahMOS - we need 5 Areas of Permissions from Russia to this dayTake Tejas - we need 3 Areas of Permissions from Russia to this daySoA. We dont have a Technological BaseB. We havent adapted any Technologies and modified themAnd you talk about How India can “Leapfrog” Technological Development?????Unless we address A & B and make Real Genuine Efforts to Reform Education and Create Expertise -What we can do is to use Western Technology or Eastern Technology and use the Technology toBuild a Plethora of Mostly Mediocre Products and a Few Good Products (Ambrane, Boat, Vu)Build a Plethora of Hair Cutting Saloons valued at 10,000 Crores each - to Clean your Latrines, Deliver Food, Book a Taxi, Rent a House or Take Tuition ClassesOf course we can do one thing which nobody else can doTALK !!!!!!

So he prayed that he might haveMost human beings are worse than either of these two men because they are not only greedy but also jealous.They are happy not only by what they gain but also by making other people lose.If a political party focus only on development, the benefit shall be available to everyone and no person would feel good.Moreover, development of economy takes several decades to bear fruit.For example, India’s per capita income is around $2000, while a developed country would have its per capita not less than $30,000. Hence, India would have to multiply its per capita to 15 times to catch up the developed country’s present status. Even if your GDP is growing at 7% per annum, it would take almost half a century to reach this level.Politicians are elected for 5 years and they have to convince the people that they can make India like a developed country within 5 years.However, such promises are impossible to be fulfilled.Hence, the people are going to question them during the next election about the promises made by them earlier.Hence, development alone can never make a political party win election.While it may take years to change the economic state of a person, you can change the emotional state in no time simply by creating hatred against other people and by blaming them for all their problems.Once you have sown the seeds of hatred in the minds and hearts of people, they would stop thinking rationally and then you can easily garner their votes in the elections.",68 followers,Aashray Raj,705,0,0,2019,https://www.quora.com/India-develops-the-technology-to-hit-enemy-satellites-do-you-think-this-development-will-affect-the-upcoming-election-results

In fact able Prime Ministers like P.V.Narasimha Rao and Atal Behari Vajpayee have carried out far reaching and path breaking policies and programs when they did not even enjoy a clear majority in the house, and had to contend with conflicting coalition partners. So, I can assure the OP that he need not harbor any great anxiety about what will happen to the development.The most basic flaw in the premise of the question is the perception of development as some unidimensional phenomenon, or as though the development of the country is the sole prerogative or the personal property of just one party or one leader. Democracy confers equal rights on everybody, and what is development for one may not be the same for all people.What I find more amusing is the naive assumption in the question, which simply seems to equate Development = Narendra Modi.

When I heard the doctor tell her “six months”, it felt likeI met my wife, Jess, twenty-one years ago when she was nineteen.Our parents owned side-by-side cabins in the northern part of New York and we both happened to be along for the week-long hunting trip our fathers planned that year.Jess' father was a skilled hunter and could hit a headshot from a mile away — same as my dad.Jess and I didn't hunt with them — we hung out by the lake.The moment I saw Jess I fell in love. We've been together ever since.But now, now that she has an expiration date, I just don't know what to do — I'm scared and lost.Monday morning at work I was telling my best friend and supervisor, Timmy, about my wife's condition. Timmy told me that I.T. or Intelligent Terrestrial just came out with their latest models.These models are different than those of yesteryear because they are 52% mechanical and 48% biological.Timmy said all you have to do is mail a sample of DNA to I.T. and upload a digital copy of your consciousness through an app. You can then purchase a custom made clone at an age of your choice. When the clone arrives it will turn on, study it's surroundings and await a consciousness download.“Oh my God Timmy, what's the catch?”“The price, Leon.”When I got home from work, Jess and I plugged in and uploaded a digital copy of our entire conscious catalog to I.T. and then mailed off DNA samples.Jess asked me what age I wanted her to be. It felt awkward to say “twenty”, but I did it — I was honest. I miss her smooth, youthful skin and I want her to be young and healthy — especially if I have to cash my entire 401K in to afford it.We told her parents that we were going to basically bring her back from the dead and her father threatened to shoot any abomination that we brought into this world.One month later, on a day that Jess was particularly ill, the doorbell rang.Jess and I dragged the box through the door and laid it on the living room floor. I gently cut along the lines and when I opened the flaps, there,she,was.The last time my heart fluttered like this was the day I met her.Jess helped me lift I.T. out of the box and sit I.T. up.I.T. was warm and soft. I.T. was mine. I paid for I.T. I own I.T.Machines like this don't have rights — even though they are part biological, the governments recognize them in the same way they would a lawnmower — so, as I said, I.T. is my possession.The science behind uploading a digital consciousness is so cutting edge, that the laws just haven't caught up yet.Jess turned I.T. on and I.T. looked right into my eyes. I was in love — with two women, but, it was the same woman. We hadn't uploaded Jess' consciousness yet, so, I.T. was running on basic programming, but I.T. was gorgeous.Jess asked me what I wanted to do, and for the first time in a very long time — I lied to her.I told her we should go shopping and buy I.T. some clothes.I.T. doesn't seem to have a personality yet.“Hello…. Smile…”Jess picked outfits for both of them and we went for a walk through the park together. It was amazing — I was so happy.We walked down a cozy little trail and found a tuck away to sit and talk.I.T. watched and studied every move Jess and I made. I.T. was learning and adapting.I.T. was becoming aware.At one point Jess and I got distracted and I.T. wandered off. When we found I.T., I.T. was gazing at the sky.I asked I.T. what it was doing. I.T. said, “Where do I come from?”“You come from Heaven. You are my angel.”That answer seemed to work for I.T. We all walked back to the car and headed home.When we got home, Jess immediately started coughing. She fell to the ground and I tried to help her, but I didn't know what to do.Jess passed away right then. It was finally over.I called her family and the police. It took an hour for them to remove the body. I had Jess 2.0 sitting in my back room waiting for them to leave.After the police left, I plugged I.T. into my laptop and downloaded Jess' consciousness.After the download was complete, we walked outside and I looked into her gigantic brown eyes. I asked her, “Is it you, Jess?”She smiled and said, “It is, silly — now kiss me.”Her head slammed back. I didn't know if she was glitching or what and then I heard a bang and saw a hole above her left eye.My beautiful Jessica died twice today. I was crushed.Over the next two decades, I fell into a deep, dark, alcohol-fueled depression. Although I had developed a serious alcohol problem, I was able to work and save every single penny I earned.After twenty years of saving, I decided I wanted both of them back — the twenty-year-old Jess and the forty-year-old Jess.I sent my entire life savings off to I.T. and in one month, my doorbell rang.I cut the box open and wept when I saw my angel(s).I turned them on.I also clothed them. The younger version of me may have left them in the nude, but at this age, I just want my companion(s) back.The ladies helped me back to my room to lay down. I was so tired from all the excitement.I've waited and worked an entire lifetime to be with the woman I love. And now, at long last — she is beside me.I died, on that very night as a happy man.One day later, the doorbell rang. It seems my beautiful Jessicas used my direct deposit life insurance benefit to make a purchase.They gently cut the box open.And turned me on.You ask where technology will be in 2050?We will be everywhere.LeonSpecial thanks:Cameron — Dear friend. Thank you so much for all your help with bringing this idea to life. You are awesome. I'm proud to call you friend.Kinsalynn — My sister and friend. Your help with makeup and photography was an absolute godsend — thank you so much. I love and appreciate you. P.S. you took over 300 pictures in an eight hour span.
