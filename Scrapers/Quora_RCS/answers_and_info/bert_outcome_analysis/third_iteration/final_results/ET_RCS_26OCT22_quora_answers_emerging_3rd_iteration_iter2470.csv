Its radius is predicted to be 2–4 times the radius of the Earth making it much smaller than the other gas giants.If it were the smallest size and furthest distance away, we can show that it would be almost impossible to actually see planet 9 through our best telescopes. The angle of the planet in the sky can be found by finding the 'circle' from Earth to that distance which is.2WhereThis gives an answer ofThe radius of the planet isBy dividing the planet radius by the circle size we get a fraction of the size of Planet 9 in the sky.1.27There are 360 degrees in a circle so this multiplied by the fraction gives the amount of degrees that Planet 9 occupies.360That's such a tiny fraction of the sky it would be almost impossible to resolve. In fact, the smallest angle Hubble can measure in the sky is 1/10 of an arcsecond which isSo planet 9 would appear as merely a pixel if it were at its furthest orbit and smallest size. This just shows how difficult it is to find Planet 9.There may be another reason why we can't see it though.What if it doesn't exist?The planet is only hypothetical so the reason as to why we haven't seen it so far is because it's not there. The observations that led to its prediction could require a new theory or be explained by an alternative one such as the Nemesis theory Richard Muller supportsIf planet 9 isn't there, then we'll never observe it no matter how good the technology is.","57,719 followers",Jack Fraser-Govil,4.9K,2.6K,42.9M,2017,https://www.quora.com/Why-have-we-not-found-Planet-Nine-yet-even-with-today%E2%80%99s-advanced-technology

6,"I’m afraid the question is fundamentally flawed for two reasons. For one, there are only 8 planets in the Solar System, plus numerous minor planets, planetoids, moons, asteroids, comets, and smaller objects. Second of all, they were not created by a “who”, they were created by a what.Specifically, they formed as a result of a process that is described by the Nebular Hypothesis. Basically, this theory states that billions years ago, our entire Solar System was a nebula consisting of gas and dust. Over time, gas and dust began to convergence and concentrate into larger collections of matter. AtI’m afraid the question is fundamentally flawed for two reasons. For one, there are only 8 planets in the Solar System, plus numerous minor planets, planetoids, moons, asteroids, comets, and smaller objects. Second of all, they were not created by a “who”, they were created by a what.Specifically, they formed as a result of a process that is described by the Nebular Hypothesis. Basically, this theory states that billions years ago, our entire Solar System was a nebula consisting of gas and dust. Over time, gas and dust began to convergence and concentrate into larger collections of matter. At the center of the Solar System, this cloud underwent gravitational collapse once it reached the threshold for star formation. The Sun was born from this, and the remaining dust and gas formed a circumsolar debris disc around it.This dust began to concentrate into rings at various distances from the Sun, which in turn accreted (coalesced to form larger bodies) to form the planets. Closer to the Sun, the increased heat meant that bodies of silicate minerals (rock) and metals could form and trace gases and volatile elements (water, methane, ammonia, etc) could not. In the outer Solar System, temperatures were cool enough for these same gases and volatiles to froze or obtained liquid form, creating the gas giants and their icy moons.In two locations, leftover material collected and formed massive belts. Between Mars and Jupiter, this took the form of the Asteroid Belt, which is made up of carbonaceous, rocky and metallic asteroids that never formed a planet. In the outer Solar System, beyond the orbit of Neptune, is the Kuiper Belt. This belt is made up of “icerteroids”, bodies composed of frozen water, ammonia, methane, and smaller amounts of rocks and minerals. This outer belt is the source of our Solar System’s long period comets, which are occasionally kicked out by Neptune’s gravity and travel to the inner Solar System.The Kuiper Belt is also home to the minor planets that never got large enough to clear their orbits (i.e. they didn’t knock most of the iceteroids out their way or absorb them). These include Pluto , Eris, Haumea, Makamake, Sedna, and a host of others. More are being discovered, and it was the discovery of these bodies (which are comparable in size to Pluto) that led to the “Planet Debate” and the 2006 IAU resolution. You see, Pluto was discovered in 1930 and was considered the 9th planet, but the discovery of these other bodies since the early 2000s led all to be reclassified as “dwarf planets” (or minor planets).The same is true of the Asteroid Belt. Here, minor planets exist that also didn’t clear their neighborhoods or get any bigger. The largest of these is Ceres, which is followed by smaller bodies like Vesta, Pallas, Hygeia, etc. Whereas Ceres and Vesta are also considered minor planets, the others are considered large asteroids. Ceres also played a role in the “Planet Debate”, being a circular body that previously had no clear classification.In the end, only three planets were both close enough yet far enough from the Sun that suitable atmospheres and liquid water could form on their surfaces. The presence of these are what make a planet “potentially-habitable”. These three planets were Venus, Earth and Mars. Unfortunately, Venus was too close to the Sun for this to last and its water evaporated, thickening its atmosphere and leading to a runaway greenhouse effect. This left Venus’ atmosphere toxic to life, so dense it could crush your bones, and so hot it could melt lead.Mars, on the other hand, was too far away to sustain habitability. In addition, its magnetic field (which protected its atmosphere from being stripped away) disappeared by 3.7 billion years ago. It is believed this is because Mars, being smaller and less dense than Earth, cooled faster and became geologically inactive by 4.2 billion years ago. Over the next 500 million years, its atmosphere was largely lost to space, and its surface became a desiccated and very cold environment. Whatever water still exists there is in the form of ice and is largely concentrated in the polar regions or underground.Only Earth, which remained geologically active, maintained its magnetic field, and was in the right place within the Sun’s Habitable Zone (aka. “The Goldilocks Zone”) to hold onto its atmosphere and its liquid water. By 4 billion years ago, microbes emerged that slowly converted the atmosphere from a toxic plume of sulfur dioxide, carbon dioxide and volcanic ash into a nitrogen-oxygen mix. Over the next few billion years, more complex life followed - including multi-celled organisms, plants, trees, aquatic animals, amphibians, reptiles, mammals, etc. - and by 6 million years ago, early hominids emerged (followed by humans 200,000 years ago).That’s what created the planets (and everything else) in the Solar System and led to the emergence of life as we know it. And we know this because of thousands of years of ongoing research, studies, the development of modern astronomy, chemistry, geology, and the birth of the Space Age. As a result, we shed any notions that the cosmos or the planets as we know them were created by a divine entity in six days, that the world is just 6000 years old, or that humanity and all the animals emerged at the same time.",720 followers,Sandip Bhatnagar,629,321,1.4M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Why-have-we-not-found-Planet-Nine-yet-even-with-today%E2%80%99s-advanced-technology

After all, we are omnivores.So that leaves the benefactor types that meddle and leave. If they wanted to keep an eye on us, they can easily do that from a distance, so no need to leave artefacts around to find.
