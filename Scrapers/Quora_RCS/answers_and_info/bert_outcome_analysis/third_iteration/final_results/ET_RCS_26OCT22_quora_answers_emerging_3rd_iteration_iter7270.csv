It would take several billion years for the black hole to engulf the Earth.In 5 billion years, when the Sun has burned all the hydrogen in its helium core it will enter in its red giant phase. Its outer layers will reach the Earth's orbit and the black hole will start swallowing the Sun like this:","1,764 followers",Jeffrey Naujok,811,254,2.5M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Hypothetically-speaking-could-we-develop-technology-to-completely-destroy-our-own-sun

8,"Let‚Äôs talk about the process of live video streaming andSome live streaming is done wLet‚Äôs talk about the process of live video streaming andSome live streaming is done with a smartphone, but more serious live productions employ additional cameras. Common live productions often use a three-camera studio setup. These cameras and other video sources are connected to a switcher that transitions between them. Audio for production is transferred to a mixer via XLR cables. Generally, the switcher adds the audio from the mixer into the final output signal. It may also include the ability to add graphics, titles, and even animations. The switcher could be hardware, software, or a little of both when capture cards are required.Encoding Live Videos into a Streamable File FormatFor the final output signal to be stored or streamed, the video signal needs to be compressed through an encoder into a ‚Äòcodec.‚Äô Codecs come in all shapes and sizes. A standard in the industry is H.264, which is often used for broadcasting and distribution. H.264 compresses the video to be easily streamed, which means compressing gigabytes to megabytes.The encoder itself might be built into the camera, but it can also be a stand-alone appliance, computer software, or mobile app. In many cases, it‚Äôs built into modern broadcast software.Once the video stream is compressed through the encoder, the video data still needs to be packaged into a real-time transfer protocol (RTP) for delivery across the internet. As a large stream of continuous data, it needs to be broken up into digestible chunks, or information packets. These packets will later be recombined and decoded into a continuous signal by the media player. Many encoders use RTMP as a standard.Delivering Streaming Media to ServersAfter packaging, the stream is either pulled or pushed to a media server. The media server might be on the same system as the encoder or remote somewhere in the cloud.Transcoding, Transizing, Transrating, and TransmuxingMedia servers ingest the stream from the encoder and convert the video as needed. Ingress is the amount of data entering the media server. Media servers can transcode the data into a new codec. They can transize the video into different resolutions and even transrate the data, creating different bitrates. Media servers can also repackage, or transmux, the data into different protocols. The data transferred out of a media server is known as egress. But let‚Äôs talk about why a media server is necessary by looking at who‚Äôs viewing the live stream and what makes a great viewing experience.Adaptive Bitrate StreamingYou want your live stream to reach as many viewers as possible, but they‚Äôre not all going to consume your stream in the same manner. Some viewers will have big screens, some will have mobile phones, some will be on amazing internet, and some could be on awful Wi-Fi or even LTE.That‚Äôs where adaptive bitrate (ABR) streaming becomes so important. A media server creates ABR ‚Äòrenditions,‚Äô which are like items on a menu consisting of all the different resolutions and bitrates created. Then, the technology playing the video can choose the best rendition for viewing based on the size of the screen and network bandwidth available ‚Äî while dynamically switching between options as resources fluctuate. In short, ABR ensures your viewers have the best quality live stream for their viewing conditions.Streaming Video to Any Device on Any ConnectionYour viewers could be watching on a set-top box, through an internet browser, or viewing through an app on their mobile device. Depending on what they‚Äôre using, they might require a different protocol. While a set-top box connected to your TV may still use RTMP, your iPhone only accepts HLS and your browser player may be running MPEG DASH. Again, your media server can convert your live stream into whatever protocol is required, called transmuxing, and ensure delivery to your viewers no matter their device of choice.There are more things a media server can do, too, such as injecting additional information, saving the stream as a video file, and doing similar conversions to the audio. And keep in mind, with one stream coming into a media server (ingest) and multiple renditions coming out (egress) you‚Äôll need more bandwidth for egress to support a large audience.Delivering Great Streaming Experiences to Audiences Around the WorldBack to viewers. Because we don‚Äôt know where they‚Äôre located, there‚Äôs still the issue of distance. The farther they are from the media server, the longer it takes for the signal to get to them. That distance can cause latency and buffering.To resolve some of these issues, many broadcasters employ a content delivery network (CDN). It‚Äôs a network of media servers spread all over the world that‚Äôs capable of handling large amounts of data. The servers closest to the viewer are called edge servers. The data stream is delivered throughout the network, finally connecting with viewers at the edge server closest to them.","9,708 followers",Tim Mensch,852,3K,18.9M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Hypothetically-speaking-could-we-develop-technology-to-completely-destroy-our-own-sun

Based on the Java Virtual Machine, this open-source language is becoming popular among Android application developers since it arrived on the scene in February 15, 2016. The best part about Kotlin is that it can easily integrate with Android Studio, the most contemporary development environment made solely to create Android apps.2. Angular Material DesignMaterial Design has been around since 2014 but we think that it not much attention has been given to how awesome it is. Considering companies are adopting mobile-first strategies, the main predicament applications face is badly designed user experiences (UX). Hence, Google focused on creating this design language that can motivate product developers to create practical yet aesthetically captivating android applications.Material design basically adds in the uniformity of experience that Google products have been lacking. The mobile-centric approach also represents the company‚Äôs will to make paradigm shifts in design. For users, the design standards will give more depth to app UX.To give an example, drop shadows and gradients can used to showcase physical space being occupied by a UI element such as a button, navigation bar or even a typing field.3. React-nativeReactjs is the next big thing for creating high-end interactive user interfaces (UIs). Everyone is talking about it and for good reason but it does not have the complete files to . So, in order to cater to the android market, the developers created React-native. The front-end library is lightweight, extensible and can be easily integrated with android studioReact-Native is a framework that utilizes Reactjs components map the actual real native iOS or Android UI components that get rendered on the app.4. FigmaOkay, we know that we are talking about android app development but to create an app, you need a chalk out the whole workflow for the mobile app. Figma is a modern tool that facilitates designers and android developers to create fully functional UIs of the app. The tool has a different varieties of design elements that can be added with the tool‚Äôs drag-and-drop feature.Figma works on the web, which means you do not have to install it. You directly go to their site and start working on projects right from the get-go. The best thing about it is that is allows full collaboration with multiple designers, get feedback from project manages and make corrections to an existing design ‚Äî a feature lacking in most major app design softwares.We will touch upon Figma at a later blog because of the multiple features it has in one package.5. FirebaseDeveloping android applications used to a burdensome 10 years ago but with so many tools that leverage development time, it assists developers to focus more on the user experience, features and overall structure of the app.Firebase is one such tool that includes multiple services that helps businesses take care of their development needs. It is useful in building mobile and web applications integrated with a real-time database. There is no explicit need to configure a server, since that is taken care by Firebase itself. Since Google took over Firebase, the major internet company added more features that enabled more developers to shift to this platform.","4,105 followers",Mehmet Fidanboylu,662,166,5.9M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Hypothetically-speaking-could-we-develop-technology-to-completely-destroy-our-own-sun

Our audience is mostly on Android phones so we developed our current released version on native Android platform. When we started thinking about iOS development, Flutter was a strong contender for us. We built a prototype in 2016 and now our app has been in production via Flutter both on iOS and Android for a year. The users did not even notice.Overall Verdict: Flutter is awesome. We were so impressed with it that I took on a role to build infrastructure for Flutter apps within Google.Why?Productivity: It took us around 3 months with 3 engineers to come up with our version 1 for Android native. It took 1 engineer 3 months to come up with Flutter version 1 in around 1/3 of the code we have written for Android.Cross Platform Performance: It really is quite native-like on iOS and Android. Most people I have shown the prototype to could not believe the app was not native.Flutter is very different in a good way. Dart feels more Java-like than JS-like. Second, there‚Äôs no templating language for now so you build your UI by nesting widgets. At first, this looks odd but you realize that it makes perfect sense and reduces the amount of context switching between logic and template. In fact, you entire app is a ‚Äúwidget‚Äù.It is easy to build high performing apps with Flutter. Flutter guides you to get used to good patterns such as composition and reactive development. This pays dividends as your app grows larger.No matter how many people on your team or what your target is, Flutter is a great option to have one codebase.
