They are tiny, but they need room to grow to be healthy and happy.We would cry in terror and scream bloody murder if dogs and cats in western countries were kept like this. But we support this treatment of other animals with our money.Shame on us.It should be a crime.This is not an anti-meat post. I love meat. Just cut down a bit and eat free-range animals that had a good life, instead of brutally tortured souls.Pigs are as smart as dogs.

1,"Force Fields.These are a great invention for humanity. Not only do they allow for almost every sci-fi scenario imaginable, they also add a great deal of value onto the human life.Right now, human lives mean very little in the face of high-end destructive technology like nuclear weapons. A single bomb can kill millions.With force fields, that would change everywhere. Nuclear weapons would be far less effective, and our constant protection would ensure the survival of our species and help us expand everywhere, including into space.As a human, your life isForce Fields.These are a great invention for humanity.

So i did some good old fashioned research.And thank God i did, because i found out those headlines were entirely misleading and inaccurate.Nigeria did NOT ban “white"" models from adverts. They banned “FOREIGN” models.In an effort to save her struggling economy and fight local unemployment, Nigeria enacted this law which has been received negatively by several African countries as it impacts other African models from places like South Africa and Ghana who come seeking for better fortunes in Africa's largest economy, Nigeria.However you feel about that law the fact is, it has ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to do with the color of your skin.So, why are so many news sources hanging on to that notion?It's simple.Headlines like those create strong emotions and generate clicks which generates revenue.This highly unethical and divisive branch of “Journalism"" disgusts me. It's not spreading truth like Journalism is supposed to be like, it's attempting to making profit by being misleading without giving a d*mn who it affects.I don't think news sources should be allowed to do that.","2,468 followers",Leyit Dagyeng,8.4K,250,10M,2022,https://www.quora.com/What-modifications-to-existing-laws-may-need-to-occur-to-address-crimes-related-to-advancing-technologies

I imagine this is happening already, we have them here and there are always lots of messages on there.The local police can be members and be alerted to something faster than a phone or put out their own messages. Strangely people are more prepared to type a few lines on a facebook page than they are to pick up the phone and call us.As a lot of low level crime is committed by people in the same area (that graffiti on the wall was probably sprayed by the kids of a household less than two streets away) and many of these households will out of habit become members and contributors to these pages too. It isn’t uncommon for the parents of a little sod to see their angel’s handiwork and deal with it themselves or even contact the victim to make amends (it happens here from time to time). That both gives some closure and also acts as a deterrent to future offences, which is the ultimate aim of a deterrent.Twitter can and does get used in a similar way - good for traffic updates on blocked roads too.Facebook helped me catch a serial paedophile 2 years ago, he was confronted by an angry mother (understatement) and photographed as he legged it to his van. The pictures were put on Facebook within a couple of minutes and he was matched up to offences in my area the same day. And these incidents were in different towns about 40 miles apart.These are suggestions that don’t actually cost anything other than someone’s time to maintain them and moderate the content. If you start installing multiple CCTV cameras throughout the neighbourhood then yes, they can be very good but they cost a lot to put in and a lot more to keep running.Technology has its place, but at the end of the day the best way to keep crime down is for people to just be good citizens and not put up with it in their area, either by confronting it (by which I mean acknowledging it rather than walk past pretending not to notice) and by engaging with the local authorities to deal with it or put strategies in place to mitigate it.","5,990 followers",Jens Böttiger,566,2.6K,17.6M,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-modifications-to-existing-laws-may-need-to-occur-to-address-crimes-related-to-advancing-technologies

Germany is not the most technologically advanced country. It could be pretty close, but there are major elements of society who dedicate themselves to making sure that Germany uses inferior technology that kills more people, damages the environment more, costs more money, and will cause the total collapse of Earth’s biosphere due to a runaway greenhouse effect. Mostly in the Green Party. Because radiation from nuclear accidents is apparently scarier than way more people dying of regular pollution constantly and the total annihilation of all life on Earth as the oceans boil away.",UNKNOWN,Shivee C.,1K,349,32.6M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-modifications-to-existing-laws-may-need-to-occur-to-address-crimes-related-to-advancing-technologies

The Coopers who failed ended up making “dry barrels” that only held produce or things that wouldn’t spoil. There are very few people who know how to make a barrel today. Even Jack Daniels, the biggest barrel maker in the world, uses an automated process now because making them by hand is too slow. The art of coopering is dying. There are very, very few people who know how to make a barrel left in the world and fewer every year, yet barrel making was an advanced technology that changed the entire world for literally thousands of years.Incidentally. the most prolific barrel in the world today is the ASB or American Standard Barrel that hold 53 gallons because America makes more barrels than anyone else in the world. Many used Jack Daniels barrels are re-used to make other kinds of liquor in other parts of the world.Do you know who the highest paid man in the community was in “ancient times”? It was the Wheelwright.Making a wheel from wood with an axle that attaches to a cart and doesn’t fall apart within a mile or two is one of the most “advanced technologies” of all time. Without it, most civilizations would have failed or failed to spread. Cart wheels are complex and the forces must play against each other continuously to hold the wheel together as it rolls. A Cartwright made as much then as a jet airline pilot back does today. In the 1880s when the average wage was $1.50 a day, the Wheelwright was making 90 dollars a week. On the Mayflower they brought one single cart over to America and it was the most valuable thing on the ship manifest, worth more than 10 times the next most valuable thing on the ship. Can you make a cartwheel? It’s an “advanced technology” that very, very few people can make today, even with machine tools.What is an “advanced technology”?","62,882 followers",Jay Bazzinotti,3.9K,22.2K,179.7M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-modifications-to-existing-laws-may-need-to-occur-to-address-crimes-related-to-advancing-technologies

And we’d leave several messes behind.For example, there’s the lead. Extensive use of lead as an additive in gasoline left readily detectable traces of lead in the environment. Indeed, one of the methods scientists used to establish that lead was an environmental hazard was by digging up ice cores and measuring lead levels across countless thousands of years and noting a huge jump at the end.Then there’s construction. Humanity has dug deep quarries for stone and minerals, chopped the tops off of mountains for coal mines, and along their sides to build roads. And we’ve dug things like the Panama and Suez canals. Those will take millions of years to finally vanish.And then there’s space. We’ve put a bunch of junk in orbit, and there’s a reflector on the moon you can bounce your own laser off of. A lot of our orbital junk will de-orbit in a few centuries, but some of it won’t, and that stuff on the moon is going to be there for a long time to come.TL;DR: A lot of information can vanish when a technological civilization collapses, but the fact of its existence is very, very hard to avoid.","5,360 followers",Valerio Cietto,677,2.4K,9.1M,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-modifications-to-existing-laws-may-need-to-occur-to-address-crimes-related-to-advancing-technologies
