One hectare of a good rice farm producesThe future of farming in India should be fewer, educated farmers running highly efficient farms and producing high value goods.A farmer in southern India inspecting his high tech farmFirst, a basic reality. One hectare of a good rice farm producesHere is a simple exercise for you:Second, there seems to be an unnecessary and illinformed alarm about farmer numbers dropping. Let me paste the graph from the new article in question.Source:In 1951, India had 98 million people working on farming. In 2014, we have 262 million people working in the farms. That is anWe don't produce lands. That means we are adding more people working on the same acre of land. Even with Green revolution our average farm productivity has increased only twice. For instance, we are producing now 3000 kgs of wheat from a hectare of land compared to 1307 before green revolution.Source:Source:Or in other words, almost every gain in green revolution is lost because India has added 3 times more agricultural labor. The farmer is back to square one - because the increase in productivity is neutralized by the increase in farmers.In 2014, have nearly 2 farming workers for every hectare of farms. These two combined produce 2200 kg of rice or 3000 kg of wheat. Or 1100 kg of rice per farmer. This is the nearly same level they produced in 1951!In summary, the Indian farmer is in the same position as they were in 1951, because our growth in farming productivity is neutralized by increase in number of farmers. While every other occupation has experienced an increase in salaries, farmers are in the same position due to this simple fact.Open your eyes to this fact and no point hitting your head against the wall.So, then why do I read a lot about farmer suicides in India?Farmer suicides in India is also not higher than a few other nations:Would not a drop in farmers cause a drop in food production?If we want to become as rich as Germany, our farmers individually would have to produce more.  We are slowly getting there. This productivity growth is already happening and will continue to happen faster than the rate at which the farmers are quitting. See how farming is changing in India.How do we build prosperity for the farmersAverage farmers salary = total food production / total laborBy basic math, we have to both increase production and decrease in farming labor for our farmers to have an increase in earnings. That is how we can become developed. If you cannot change both factors change one of the them drastically. It is basic math guys and not rocket science.For production to increase, India needs:In the meanwhile, we need toInstead of worrying about the reducing number of farmers, realize that this reduction is essential for increasing farmer earnings & reducing poverty. If anyone says otherwise, push them to do the basic numbers.",26 followers,Balaji Viswanathan,3.6K,5.6K,427.1M,2015,https://www.quora.com/What-is-going-to-be-the-future-of-agriculture-in-India-from-now

What happens? The farmer ends up losing his money & effort of months. When a certain produce is scarce, does the price i.e. the returns for the farmer go up? Not always.Who is making money either way? The middleman. ThisMost farmers no longer find agriculture worthwhile.If today farmers are forced to take to violent demonstrations, it is a reflection of the apathy they get from the government itself.Remember, the rich farmer, whose number is small, never loses. It is the small farmer, the 86% segment, that suffers.Kurnool: Desperate farmers forced to sell tomatoes at Rs 1 a kgThe same tomato costs Rs. 15/- per kg in Bangalore market.MSP - BETWEEN THE ROCK AND THE HARD PLACE - the edible oils case studyIndia spends $10 billion every year on importing vegetable oils.Farmers say, they will switch to growing oil seeds, such as rapeseed and sunflower ONLY if the government promises guaranteed rates for the produce.One Punjab farmer said,""Sometimes we grow sunflower, but we don't get to sell it at the MSP"". ""In fact,If you have noticed it, after the COVID lockdown, prices of edible oil shot up by 25–30%. Why it should happen? The sunflower oil pack I used to buy at 96/- per liter, now costs up to 136/-. How come?If helped, such farmers of Punjab and Haryana can help India cut shipments of edible oils, India's third biggest import bill, after crude oil and gold.But grain growers will not make the switch in large numbers unless the government offers financial assistance in growing vegetable oil seeds.Such a move looks unlikely unless the government sees the sense in the demand for MSP.Edible oils imports - the money spinner for the governmentThe government earns Rs 35,000 crore ($4.77 billion) from levies on edible oil imports. Can it not set aside just Rs 4000 crore a year forHigher output of oil seeds should mean -The growers' transition away from grain is a key step in a government plan to boost oil seed production, says a senior government official.WE DON'T NEED ANY MORE GRAINGovernment purchases, initially meant to promote self-sufficiency in domestic staples, have spurred farmers, especially those with access to better irrigation, to favor grain over the years, rather than oil seeds and pulses. That has pushed India to the rank of theOil seeds are now mainly grown in rain-fed areas with low crop yields, but Punjab, with efficient irrigation, can expect higher yields.Farmers in Punjab & Haryana can produce 6 million tonnes of rapeseed if they divert half the area now under wheat, bringing a domestic supply boost of 2.5 million tons.All the government needs to do is give the farmer the right incentive and the confidence.(Source: The Economic Times)Contract farming - how to make it ‘win-win’?The government doesn’t want the burden of legally guaranteed MSP, one of core demands of the agitating farmers.Legally guaranteed MSP forces the government procure at the MSP at minimum, andWe are missing something here, the government doesn’t explain why the contractor company should NOT commit to a minimum guarantee like MSP.Note, prices are dynamic, they vary per many conditions (bumper or poor crop is one of the main factor). So, there is nothing wrong in the farmer demanding an assurance.The farmers are scared of private companies (“Contract Farming”) exploiting them.Leave aside Contract Farming, which anyway happens without that label, it has been happening for ages.When 86% of the Indian farmers hold <2 hectare per family, it is cruel to say, “The Demand-Supply economics will decide your income. Don’t bother me further.”if a small or marginal farmer wants to really benefit, he must have the contract CLEARLY specify a certain fixed income, irrespective of the yield.The comprehensive coverage of the problems - What ails Indian agricultural sector?

Financial institutions will be looking for ways to reduce costs and increase their margins on these products, creating fertile ground for fintech solutions.Taking a look at the type of fintech opportunities I’ve been seeing over the past year to 18 months as an investor, I’ve seen a few business-to-business solutions including automating workflow, introducing algorithmic predictive cashflow analysis for small businesses, and digitizing underwriting and pricing financial products for small business lending. These opportunities mainly centre around the same recurring theme - financial activities are costly for small businesses due to lack of scale, coupled with small and medium-sized enterprises being drivers of economic growth, which means financial institutions need more cost-efficient and effective ways of serving this market. Financial technology is the direction this is heading.Two billion adults worldwide do not have bank accounts. This represents a completely new market opportunity for many financial institutions. Mobile money accounts can drive financial inclusion and accessibility, as seen in Sub-Saharan Africa. Especially if you consider people in rural areas or with limited time or connections to the already shrinking branch network, digital and mobile banking are potential solutions.When I think about significant developments in financial services of the past, not necessarily fuelled by technological innovation, I think of:All of these innovations reached large markets and made financial products or services more accessibility to more people. I think the next big thing(s) in fintech will similarly reach large markets and will be theIn developing this answer, I made the following notes.

On that level, there is no doubt that I'm rich, and much richer than one might imagine from my relatively meagre (compared to billionaires!) financial resources.
