Lots of mysterious terms are bandied about excitedly in tedTalks, at government think tanks, and at high-tech conferences—Today, many people fear irrelevance, and they are frantic to use their remaining political power before it is too late. Brexit and the rise of Donald Trump may therefore demonstrate a trajectory opposite to that of traditional socialist revolutions. The Russian, Chinese, and Cuban revolutions were made by people who were vital to the economy but lacked political power; in 2016, Trump and Brexit were supported by many people who still enjoyed political power but feared they were losing their economic worth. Perhaps in the 21st century, populist revolts will be staged not against an economic elite that exploits people but against an economic elite that does not need them anymore. This may well be a losing battle. It is much harder to struggle against irrelevance than against exploitation.The revolutions in information technology and biotechnology are still in their infancy, and the extent to which they are responsible for the current crisis of liberalism is debatable. Most people in Birmingham, Istanbul, St. Petersburg, and Mumbai are only dimly aware, if they are aware at all, of the rise of AI and its potential impact on their lives. It is undoubtable, however, that the technological revolutions now gathering momentum will in the next few decades confront humankind with the hardest trials it has yet encountered.When talking about money or how to make a living, despite the best of intentions, any financial advice given to a person has limitations regarding perception and enlightenment. How much you reveal to the person from whom advice is sought and the advisor’s capacity to conceptualize, describe and communicate the best economic course of actions determine the usefulness of the advice. Services like Google and Youtube are used for easy access to endless advice. The pitfalls of this approach is qualifying the soundness and credentials of the advisors. I prefer a visualization exercise where I see myself in a cave full of prisoners who’ve been in this cave all their lives. All the inmates have the same jobs and share the same shopping habits. The cave’s exit is not impossible to reach but since it entails making changes to ones daily thinking routine, most prisoners stay inside the cave. If a prisoner managed to exit the cave, at first he or she would be disoriented because being exposed to new skills that are in higher demand may seem intimidating and scary. But as the fear goes away, the person is no longer a prisoner to outdated skills and is able to have access to more economic opportunities. The choice to put in the work to make these changes is up to you.After learning this, as a former cave dweller, you’ll see how many of your former colleagues skills gradually become outdated. You may not feel a Need to return to the cave and feel conflicted. If you returned to the cave and rejoined them, you would take no pleasure in their accolades or praise for knowledge of present opportunities. If you’re an altruist and want to help the unenlightened, will you have enough Time to truly make a difference? For their own part, the people may see you as deranged, not really knowing what the economic ramifications will be and may say you think you’re better than the rest of them. Lastly, is your process Scalable? A system, business or software that is described as scalable has an advantage because it is more adaptable to the changing needs or demands of its users or clients.The best AI systems can get good at very specific things. AI isn’t a monolithic entity that understands all dimensions of whoever you are in a deeper way than how you understand yourself. That doesn’t exist today and we’re far removed from it being a reality. Even with the help of AI, we should enable individuals to practice openness and awareness, self-critique and reflect upon things central to one’s own beliefs, thoughts, actions, behavior, and results. Openness can inform private, personal or group discussions. Ideally, all capable people should look for reasons to start/continue the work of self improvement. Nobody is equal to anybody. Even the same person is not equal to him/herself on different days. The first steps to continuous improvement is to know yourself, practice consciousness and be in the moment. If we want to change how things are, then we need to change the way we use words. But can language-games set us free? language usage admits a process of argument and change, in virtue of what it is - since language games are played by humans, we can notice what is going on when we see things as this, or as that. Take the controversy over all male speaker events. You can look at the line-up and say ‘a panel of experts’, or you can say it’s a ‘manel of experts’. But is it only a manel if you choose to see it that way? The same labeling game can be done with things we hold near and dear like religion and politics. These examples invite us to question what we take to be given in everyday uses of language. how we use language admits contestation and change, in virtue of what it is.My remarks might suggest that we need to play language-games differently if we are to change anything. Maybe it’s wrong of me to share my rebellious views since I live in a state of dissatisfaction with language. At times I feel alienated, cut off from others and myself within language. While the contented are untroubled, and most people are inclined to think that way. Using language is an integral part of the human condition. We live within language, yet our way of life is something we find hard to see.I wrote this as a therapeutic exercise, not as a way to peddle ready made answers to this predicament. Indeed, as long as there is language it will confuse us, we will face the temptation to misunderstand. And there is no vantage point outside it. There is no escape from language-games then, but we can forge a kind of freedom from within them. We might first need to ‘be stupid’ or embrace our insignificance if we are to see this regardless of upcoming technology.",UNKNOWN,Elena Ledoux,27.7K,6.4K,99.7M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Is-it-possible-to-change-human-life-completely-with-the-help-of-upcoming-technology-in-2020

And it was my full time job. I was going to auto tech school at night hoping for a better career one day.I started drinking heavy. I didn’t care. It was bad enough that I was already poor, on welfare and housing assistance. But when all that misery combined with alcohol, my situation made me feel even more hopeless. And I was ready to let go.But life turned into a blessing on that fateful(SOOOO EMBARRASSING!)I started to walk out after my purchase when I decided to buy a NY Daily News. But it’s too early. No daily news, only The NY Times. So I grabbed one, handed over my $1.50 and walked out.I immediately went to the help wanted ads when I got back in my apartment. And there it was. The biggest help wanted add on the page.$12 - $18 per hour.For one day only 9AM-12PM. on that following Monday.Doors close promptly at 12.I was twenty-four years old and never came close to earning $5 per hour.I woke up early that Monday morning. And gave myself two hours to get there for a trip that takes about one hour. I put on my Sunday best, grabbed some résumés and started my trip to the JFK Hilton.I arrived and found the conference room and it was barren. There were only about fifty people in the conference room. It didn’t feel like a job fair. I almost turned around because I thought I was in the wrong place.We were called in the order that we signed in. I watched as some people left after the short interview and some sat back down. I was one of the people that was told to sit back down after my interview.Round two came as fast as round one. This company has this job fair thing down to a science. I’m called back up to the table by Mrs. Alexander. I will never forget her. She hands me a drug test cup and says follow me. A drug test! at a job fair. Probably the best way to weed out the druggies.After that, I fill out all my employment forms. And then she says. “let’s go over some things while we wait for your results. Because of your experience and interests I have decided to hire you as a motor pool mechanic. This is your rate of pay, you will be on 90 days probation with random drug testing, report to this man at this location this time next Monday. Now read and sign your code of ethics booklet.”(And with the most beautiful motherly I understand what you have been going through smile) Mrs. Alexander says “Congratulations Gerry and fix your tie.”I’M HIRED! The whole process took all of 40 minutes. I went from $4.35 per hour. To $16.52 in 40 minutes. I walked out of that Hilton with tears in my eyes.It only gets better from there. I start work and immediately fall in love with the company, the work hours, the people, and of course the pay. Life got good and was only going to get better.I get great advice from an older worker. One can go anywhere in this company. Just get your Qualies (Qualifications) for everything, go to class for everything, read and study everything and then get your ass out of the motor pool.So I did just that. I went from repairing company vehicles at the motor pool, to lineman electrician, and now my present position as a locomotive engineer earning six figures. Six figures with a high school degree and a technical school certificate. And I can honestly say that I do not mind paying taxes at the end of every year.Being poor and uneducated gave me serious depression. And That Sunday NY Times was destiny.Something was definitely pulling the strings behind the scenes for me. I was going the opposite direction of where I am today.","41,553 followers",Rakshith Akira,23.7K,467,18.3M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Is-it-possible-to-change-human-life-completely-with-the-help-of-upcoming-technology-in-2020

I never dreamt of luxuriousness in my life.I can live my entire life with an ordinary shirt and trousers. I never dreamt of stylishness, richness and money.I always had a desire to become a saint. I'm a very ordinary soul, living a very simple life. I never craved for making money in life. I was adjusted to the normal lifestyle.I never used to become jealous of anybody's wealth or dress. I used to prefer peace over money.People crave to look stylish, everyone is obsessed with their looks and their brand outfits, but I neither gave importance to my look nor about my outfits.I always had a dream to leave this materialistic world and to take oath as a saint in Himalayas.I believed in simplicity.I believed in “Don’t be workaholic and money minded person, because the white cloth which will be wrapped around your dead body will have no pockets.”So, I never thought of becoming rich in life. Literally I had zero desire towards money.Today!An incident at 2 am shook me away!!My mother asked me to wake up. She was tensed like hell.Me: Maa, what happened? (I was in shock)She: Your father is struggling to breathe.I ran towards my father. He was literally struggling to breathe and His heart was having a burning sensation.For a moment I was stunned and didn't know what to do?We decided to take him to the hospital. I took out my neighbors mobile number from my dad's phone. (I didn't bother to keep my neighbors number till that moment)I called my neighbor at 2:30 am.At 2:35 am, he came out of his home and he took out his car and waiting for us.Do you believe that? I've been living in this house for the last 6.5 years but have never spoke to my neighbor. Sadly yes, you should believe it.I spoke to him today for the first time in the span of 6.5 years.Somehow, my father felt quite at ease after sometime. So we dropped the plan of going to the hospital.My neighbor and his family came up to my house, as they were waiting outside in a car. They suggested some home remedies. My father felt ease after trying out the suggestion.I thanked my neighbors for coming up at the right time to help. My neighbors asked me to call at any moment, they will be there to help me.My father felt at ease and went to sleep at 3 am. Everything came back to normal, but not my mind.I couldn't sleep after that incident.That's when my life changed! I will explain you in detail in the last paragraph of this answer.A lot of thoughts going in my mind at that very short moment, when I saw my father struggling to breathe.I literally felt ashamed!Because, I was not in a position to say, “Doctor don't worry about money I need my father to get well soon”Yes! The last paragraph!!A very quick moment, never let me to sleep. I started to think of money. Yes! I need money and I want to become rich. Hell with peaceful life.I need to bid goodbye to this ordinary and simple lifestyle. A small moment changed my philosophy of life which I was following from 23.5 years.Sometimes, I used to question myself.“When people know that they will be going to die one or the other day. Why they are making money? Why they are going for higher packages despite getting a good Package in their old company.”But, today I got the answer.Life is a b*tch, it teaches the valuable lessons at the worst moments. I should stop being average. I need to earn more and live a comfortable life henceforth.People change because of their circumstances and situations. People grow from their pains. People learn from their pains. People attain maturity from the worst phases they have undergone.Let me change my life to a better one. Let me take my life quite seriously. Let me get settled down soon. Let me stop all my bad habits.Everything happens for the best, because it teaches you the lesson for your improvement.Sayonara!!(Your little appreciation and honest feedback makes me write even more.

The man was a naturalized U.S. citizen, having been born in a Middle-East country. During this time, our “system” was rife with false positives—folks that might have the same or similar name with a known terrorist or someone with ties to terrorism. Sometimes, they might even have the same birthday, and yet not be the suspect in question.Per our standard operating procedures (SOPs), this man was handcuffed, escorted into our secondary inspection area and subjected to a personal search.Also per our SOPs, this individual was isolated for further questioning.Now, all of this was done without my personal knowledge. That’s the purpose of SOPs, so certain critical situations are all handled in a specific way, according to a specific standard, even when a supervisor is not on scene to direct operations.However, that’s no excuse. I was in charge, and I was responsible for the treatment this individual received.While walking through the station, I observed this man, sitting handcuffed in an isolated area, guarded by two armed officers and waiting for an officer with specialty training to question him regarding any possible ties to terrorism. This, in and of itself, was not particularly unusual. It was also a part of our SOPs.What immediately struck me as unusual, however, was that this man was silently crying, tears flowing down his face. I stopped outside the isolation room and asked one of the officers to brief me on the situation, which he did.I then entered the room and sat opposite the man. I asked him, “What’s wrong? Are you in pain?”“No,” he answered simply.There was something about his demeanor, like he had been betrayed and injured in some way.I asked him, “Is there something you need? Something I can do for you?”“My wallet,” he said. “Look in my wallet.”His wallet lay on the desk in front of me, the result of the officers’ emptying of his pockets as part of the search for weapons.I opened his wallet and emptied the contents onto the desk. “There,” he nodded toward a folded newspaper article that had tumbled out of his wallet. “There, read the paper.”I unfolded a worn piece of newsprint. It was an article that told of a small-town young man who had enlisted in the U.S. Army, only 19 years old. He had been killed in the line of duty in Iraq just a few months earlier.I felt a chill run down my spine as I realized the young soldier’s last name was the same as that of the man who sat, handcuffed, in front of me.“That my son, that my son (sic),” he sobbed, as tears again flowed freely down his cheeks. “My son, he die for this country! HE DIE FOR THIS COUNTRY!” More sobs. “I … I love this country. I love my son … my son … my son.”I had been around. I had heard hundreds, maybe thousands of stories in my 30-plus years in Customs. Nothing had ever affected me in this way.“Uncuff this man,” I instructed one of the officers. “But Chief,” he objected until I cut him off with a wave of my hand.“Never mind,” I said. I told the silently crying man to stand and turn around so I could uncuff him.Afterward he just turned back around and sat back down on the hard back chair. He stared straight ahead, a blank expression on his face.“I am sorry for your loss,” I told him. “I know that this means less than nothing to you now, but I am so sorry for your loss.”He stared at me for a long moment, maybe twenty seconds. He reached out his hands towards me, and I grasped his forearms as he grasped mine. We sat and cried together, silently. The two officers looked on, clearly uncomfortable, unsure what to do.",36 followers,Deepika Yadav,6.8K,86,3.4M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Is-it-possible-to-change-human-life-completely-with-the-help-of-upcoming-technology-in-2020

At 18 weeks you can see the outline of their faces. You can see the shape of a hand as it caresses a cheek, our son’s cheek. I know that shape. I’ve been watching it for days now.She has felt the impression of that hand for far longer.She is sobbing, we both are. We are holding each other.

I've read each of the comments and am moved by the responses written there. Several people have asked for an update, so here goes:We went with the surgery. There were complications. Brooke ended up in the hospital on strict bed rest for 6 weeks. We tried everything we could to keep those boys in there but they were born early (24 weeks) anyway. The next 6 months were a nightmare. Maybe someday I’ll write about that too but like Churchill said, “When you’re going through Hell, keep going.”There are and will be lifelong repercussions to the choice we made. Baby A (our little Jayden) has Epilepsy, Cerebral Palsy and Autism Spectrum Disorder. He takes this in stride and I am awed by his grace some days. Other days I want to crawl into a cave. Our boys are doing great but they will always have challenges that were dictated by the circumstances of their birth. Having said that, I’ve never regretted our choice, even for a second. And if I could go back, with full knowledge, I would make the same choice happily and wait with open arms for the chance to smile at their little faces for the first time again.",0 followers,Ahanaa Kumar,508,0,0,2019,https://www.quora.com/Is-it-possible-to-change-human-life-completely-with-the-help-of-upcoming-technology-in-2020

Whilst writing this answer appropriately 2,000+ people would have died. More than 2,000 babies born.Earth’s population is growing bigger than it is slower. That’s a shitload (which is a real type of measurement, but I mainly used it as a metaphor).Deaths is bad, but without those deaths, births would accelerate in comparison and humans would starve, dehydrate and worse.In 1996, there was a massacre in Scotland in a town called Dunblane. It happened inside a school. Some was killed. (And remember it was the first and last school shooting in Britain’s history)A year later in 1997 the U.K. government put a law in place that banned guns here.There has never been a school shooting since or before.So, without bad, there is no action that took place to create greatness.In 1912, a RMS ship called the Titanic set sailed.The titanic prior to its departure had a fire.After it set sailed not many days later the right side of the ship scraped on an ice burg.Due to the fire, the ship was damaged and sank a few hours later.Some passengers survived by life boats. But, not all survived because there wasn’t many life boats.White star line, the company behind the RMS titanic didn’t want to fill the ship with life boats as it would look ugly.There wasn’t enough life boats for everyone meaning many died.So, after the incident, a law was put in place for it be legal requirement to have the right amount of life boats.Without bad, actions to make things good wouldn’t happen.The Salem witch trials.You can look online for information about that. I’m not educated enough on it to say too much.But without that era happening, laws wouldn’t be made and people with common sense wouldn’t have been largely popular.

To say that my sexuality was confused and perverted is an understatement.  I am shamed by all that I partook in, both by force and experimentation.My dad was a drunk and whore, and my mom did all she could to keep the house running and the two of us cared for.Coming from that background, I was that kid in school that everybody ignored, nobody picked for the sport teams.  The one who got ridiculed and insulted.    The only friend I had until I was 15 was the one whose older brother was raping me. Yes, raping.I still remember how I dreamed of being a serial killer, and had sadistic sexual fantasies.   I had so much rage and anger in me it was unbelievable.  I only got into 2 fights, and was so vicious that I sent the boys into ICU.  But, it was self defense in both cases, and there was multiple guys in each so nothing happen.  But, it just settled me into nobody wanted to be near me.I hated everybody and was a major fan of anybody who would kill.  Nobody, not even my parents knew of this.  I wanted to find a career that would put me around the country without being tracked (think truck driver) so that I could see how many I could kill without being caught.  At 12, I was forced as a ride along with a sheriff officer, and what he told my parents afterwards was that I scared him and I was going to be trouble.I was suicidal.  There was a few times that I attempted it, but by miracle, none were successful.  I have no idea of how God kept me alive, or how it can be explained without Him.  There were times that it was amazing, and times that fear stopped me,  sometimes it is simple explanations.  I have, and still do feel that death is relief, I just know it can not be at my hand.  I do not discuss these with anybody, lest my wife should know.   Its not something that I want her to be burdened with.When I was 15, my school had a religion critiquing class.  I attended, expecting it to be fun to tear apart beliefs.   One time, we had a field trip to a crusade, kind of like a pre-runner to the ""Harvest Crusades"" that Greg Laurie does.   There was an Alter call at the end of it.  I went forward and accepted Christ into my life.That was the start of an amazing adventure.  The greatest thing was that for the next 3 days, I felt this unbeatable feeling.   Like nothing could ever hurt me again.  And, for the first time in my life, I knew Love.  My mom loved me, but I just never knew what Love felt like.  During those 3 days, I learned it.The first change was amazing.   My sexual preferences turned to totally, 100% age appropriate heterosexual.   To this day, I still struggle with an addiction to Porn, but immediately, I only wanted a female that was around my age.  And, I did not want to hurt her, and no weird fetishes.  That was the first 3 days.I realized later, I did not want to hurt anybody any  more.  I had lost my desire to be a serial killer.  I had empathy, something that I never knew I was missing.  I was the one defending others, and proved I was willing to die to do it.Since then, I have assisted more than a dozen children who needed help, by putting everything I had on the line for them.  They know what I mean.  I have been faithful to my wife for almost 40 years now, when before I had valued sexual affairs as being the highest honor a man could have (thanks dad).Material goods mean very little to me, I have learned contentment.  I still recall thinking that ""here"" was a bad place to be, I had to keep changing, keep altering things.I was a wall flower who used to think of murder.  Now I am an extrovert who protects others regardless of the cost to  me.   I did get the truck driving job, but instead of killing, i have traveled the country helping and protecting without being known in so many instances.I never wanted to trust, never wanted to be near people.  Now, I can not imagine life without my wife.   I miss my friends at church during the week.  Its amazing how much I have changed.Sorry for the long answer, but this is something I have not opened about before, and its finally time to give all credit to Jesus, my love, my Lord, my King.Thank you for reading, Dave.",26 followers,Balaji Viswanathan,15.2K,5.6K,427.1M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Is-it-possible-to-change-human-life-completely-with-the-help-of-upcoming-technology-in-2020

And it was my full time job. I was going to auto tech school at night hoping for a better career one day.I started drinking heavy. I didn’t care. It was bad enough that I was already poor, on welfare and housing assistance. But when all that misery combined with alcohol, my situation made me feel even more hopeless. And I was ready to let go.But life turned into a blessing on that fateful(SOOOO EMBARRASSING!)I started to walk out after my purchase when I decided to buy a NY Daily News. But it’s too early. No daily news, only The NY Times. So I grabbed one, handed over my $1.50 and walked out.I immediately went to the help wanted ads when I got back in my apartment. And there it was. The biggest help wanted add on the page.$12 - $18 per hour.For one day only 9AM-12PM. on that following Monday.Doors close promptly at 12.I was twenty-four years old and never came close to earning $5 per hour.I woke up early that Monday morning. And gave myself two hours to get there for a trip that takes about one hour. I put on my Sunday best, grabbed some résumés and started my trip to the JFK Hilton.I arrived and found the conference room and it was barren. There were only about fifty people in the conference room. It didn’t feel like a job fair. I almost turned around because I thought I was in the wrong place.We were called in the order that we signed in. I watched as some people left after the short interview and some sat back down. I was one of the people that was told to sit back down after my interview.Round two came as fast as round one. This company has this job fair thing down to a science. I’m called back up to the table by Mrs. Alexander. I will never forget her. She hands me a drug test cup and says follow me. A drug test! at a job fair. Probably the best way to weed out the druggies.After that, I fill out all my employment forms. And then she says. “let’s go over some things while we wait for your results. Because of your experience and interests I have decided to hire you as a motor pool mechanic. This is your rate of pay, you will be on 90 days probation with random drug testing, report to this man at this location this time next Monday. Now read and sign your code of ethics booklet.”(And with the most beautiful motherly I understand what you have been going through smile) Mrs. Alexander says “Congratulations Gerry and fix your tie.”I’M HIRED! The whole process took all of 40 minutes. I went from $4.35 per hour. To $16.52 in 40 minutes. I walked out of that Hilton with tears in my eyes.It only gets better from there. I start work and immediately fall in love with the company, the work hours, the people, and of course the pay. Life got good and was only going to get better.I get great advice from an older worker. One can go anywhere in this company. Just get your Qualies (Qualifications) for everything, go to class for everything, read and study everything and then get your ass out of the motor pool.So I did just that. I went from repairing company vehicles at the motor pool, to lineman electrician, and now my present position as a locomotive engineer earning six figures. Six figures with a high school degree and a technical school certificate. And I can honestly say that I do not mind paying taxes at the end of every year.Being poor and uneducated gave me serious depression. And That Sunday NY Times was destiny.Something was definitely pulling the strings behind the scenes for me. I was going the opposite direction of where I am today.","41,553 followers",Rakshith Akira,23.7K,467,18.3M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Is-it-possible-to-change-human-life-completely-with-the-help-of-upcoming-technology-in-2020

He, like all of his family and most people he knows, is a farmer, so the weather matters a lot to him, and any other news will be a long time coming, including that his brother, who lives just a couple towns away, broke his leg a few days back and passed away from an infection. He works from sun up to sundown because he has little machinery and he would probably work longer if he had access to something better than candles to provide light.Our other man wakes up in 2018 to the sound of an alarm clock, he is not hot or cold because his home has central heating. His pajamas and bedding are quite clean because he has a washer and dryer. He is a bit groggy because he can light his home at the flick of a switch so often stays up later than he should. Fortunately he has hot coffee and a hot shower to help him wake up, and he checks his email while drinking that coffee and listening to the news and weather. He already knows his brother broke his leg a few days back, even though he lives a long distance away, and of course he does not die from an infection, he’s just at home bored and probably would welcome a phone call.These are two very different lives. They are separated by three centuries, a dozen generations, and a slew of inventions both major and minor. Those inventions, major and minor, have altered our civilization profoundly during that time. My answer however is not those inventions, but rather the ones emerging nowadays that will change our lives once more, many of which get little notice in the news.Even those emerging technologies that get reported with much pomp and hype often bypass a lot of the simple yet drastic changes they will bring to how we go about our normal day. A survey of technologies that don’t get talked about a lot, but will change the world we live in, requires introducing those technologies and explaining the potential of each. The trick is that technologies that don’t get a lot of fanfare don’t get it because their value and applications are not too obvious. Fundamentally, technology is about making our lives better, safer, and more convenient. To talk about the impact technology will have on our lives we need to go deeper than just what the technology does, like how a fusion reactor makes electricity cheaper and renewable, an obvious benefit, but also how it alters our day to day life. Cheaper electricity is awesome, an energy source that doesn’t run out or cause environmental problems is awesome, but it is easy to overlook all the other benefits that come along with them.We need to cover several such technologies. So to do this we will walk through a day in the life of two people, Sam, who lives nowadays in the year 2018, and Hannah, who lives just a few generations from now inOkay,What’s interesting about Sam and Hannah’s lives is that they both live in a pretty automated and high tech civilization.We spend a lot of time on this answer talking about futures in Hannah’s Era or even centuries further ahead, and we tend to focus on big things. New spaceships, new energy sources, giant constructs we could build around our own star or other stars and the ships that will get you there. Not today though, for today it does not matter that Ted was actually playing golf in a rotating habitat orbiting the Earth, complaining about how the spin throws off his normal swing. We care that his golf partner was actually lying down at home on his bed playing with him in virtual reality, and that he, Ted, and Hannah were thousands of kilometers apart, but all felt like they were in the same environment chatting, even though they were not in the same place and quite possibly all saw different environments. We don’t care that they have rocket ships with big fusion powered drives that can get to Mars in a week, we care about them having cars they can sleep in, fully relaxed in the knowledge that it could drive through a blizzard without a risk of accident and that if one did somehow happen, a dozen safety systems would pop on deploying airbags and restraints before the vehicle even hit the target, and that if somehow even that wasn’t enough, an automated ambulance would be on the scene in moments with robots controlled by experts hundreds of kilometers away piloting them, and already knowing from the vehicle monitors exactly what happened and where all the injuries were and how severe. We also don’t particularly care that Hannah’s son can do classes online, we already have ever-improving technology allowing that. We care about the automated interactive aspects of that, something called Affective Computing, or computers and systems that can recognize, interpret, process, or simulate human body language and affects. Fundamentally it is this sort of technology that holds the strongest potential to revolutionize our lives.Sure, a student can watch a recorded lecture and pick from several variations of it by other people covering that same topic, just as you can do now on YouTube for instance. But it is aThe Uncanny Valley, our tendency to respond more negatively to things which seem closer to human than further away, is a big hurdle to making such simulations, but if you can get past it, you open the door for books that don’t just get read aloud by some cold disjointed voice, but can be real-time performed like a TV show or interactive virtual environment without needing actors. It’s a lot easier to learn the history of the world when instead of a book or lecture or even historical TV drama, a person can land in that environment where the bits they find boring can be seamlessly detected and altered, so they remain focused on the important knowledge while enjoying themselves. It’s nice to have a test that doesn’t need to have questions checking your reading comprehension, because it already knows what that was from monitoring you while you read, and even nicer if most text can adapt as you’re reading it to rephrase the information or the question to better communicate to you as an individual. It’s like the automatic translator that doesn’t just hear what someone said in another language and translate it word for word, but instead can convert all the idioms and expressions into another language and its own idioms and expressions. It will be even cooler if one day we can just download knowledge and skills into your head, like in the film theWe didn’t focus on cool new power production methods like fusion today, we focused on ways to conveniently get power. Wireless energy transmission by magnetic induction or energy beaming, smaller and better batteries and solar panels, or harvesting energy right from the person. Leaching just a little energy away from every motion, maybe even putting devices in the body that could steal a bit of energy from your own food to transmit it to devices in or on you. IPredicting the future of technology is always a hit and miss game, often in hindsight the stuff is obvious, but can’t be predicted in advance. Some technology and its impact is easy enough to predict, but what makes them inaccurate in most cases is all those tiny secondary advantages and changes and those tend to focus on human desire and convenience. It’s not that hard to predict faster computers, the internet, satellites, or cell phones. What’s hard to predict is people using those to post a picture of what they ate for lunch. Once you do, you can imagine that a lot of restaurants will advertise online and show photos of the menu. It will seem obvious in hindsight that someone is going to make a piece of software that can look at that image and make some smart guesses about its nutritional value and calorie count. It will seem obvious in hindsight that as we get more Affective Computing able to monitor your reactions, your computer will get better at showing you bits of stuff on your social media newsfeed that you’ll enjoy, and that advertisers will be able to hit you with an ad showing a picture of pizza with the toppings you like when you are just getting a little hungry and haven’t had pizza recently, and tomorrow you’ll get shown sandwiches instead. It’s predictable that 3D printers, and fast, cheap, delivery might put a dent in classic retail shopping. It’s predictable that automated vehicles, not needing expensive drivers, will make it much cheaper to deliver things or take a taxi, so that fewer people might own individual vehicles.It’sHowever, it is very easy for us miss a lot of those secondary applications that can quietly sneak in there to revolutionize our lives just as much as landing on the Moon did, or going to Mars will.Have a great day (10 april 2018) !",0 followers,Derek Maurice,862,222,4.3M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Is-it-possible-to-change-human-life-completely-with-the-help-of-upcoming-technology-in-2020

But they would have an abundance of material on Earth, especially of carbon, which would likely be the building blocks of such an assemblers. If you were carrying a jar of them and tripped and they spilled out, and they had no limit, they would quickly devour the entire earth with no way of stopping them.But here is where things get interesting: These tiny robots would have the ability to construct molecules from atoms, giving them the ability to produce amazing materials like graphene, cubes of apple, and even brain material.With advanced nanotechnology in the form of self-replicators, the entire world would experience a revolution. Think for a second about what wouldn’t change in the face of machines that can produceProduction jobs would cease. The price of every item ever created would be lowered massively. Supercomputers and experiments regarding brain material would become almost commonplace. Terraforming other planets would take years if not months.
