Depending on which reason caused me to ghost on my partner, my expectation of their reaction also differs.I understand this paints a very bad picture of me. I just wanted to give an honest answer as to why I do ST and what I expect whenever I do them. As a tip, whenever your narc goes silent on you, let them be. Don’t contact them. They will always come back anyway. Don’t give them the satisfaction of seeing how miserable you are without hearing from them.

1,"One of the tell-tell signs that you are dealing with a narcissistically traited individual is the repetitive and patterned behaviors they use to secure what they want from you. They have spent years establishing and perfecting those patterns. The sequencing may vary between individuals or circumstances. Their goal is to achieve what they desire when they desire it. It often becomes a mind game they like to play. They are not put off by name calling, anger, logical and practical reasoning, pleading, tears, or common sense.

It is the repetitive patterns that become predictable if you stay with them long enough. It fits into the criteria for personally disordered. I hope better for you.

2,"He is contacting you by putting his provocations online. Coward is attacking you publicly to convince others that his actions are justified.

Narcissists vibrate at as near to a corpse level as you can get because they are in shame and guilt, which are the lowest emotions on the frequency scale.Your body can actually reject someone’s energy, which is why you were sick or well on your way.The intense feelings that you have, as the person asking this question has, wanting to know what the narcissist will do if you go no contact?It’s like asking what your wine bottle will do if you shove it in a cabinet and don’t get it back out- it’s inert.

6,"What happens when you don’t chase (ask why he is ignoring) a narcissist during their silent treatment?My marriage to the ex-covert narc lasted as long as it did because I never chased after him. Yes, I worked hard for my marriage. I went through a lot, too. However, I’ve never been a chaser. He would go silent and I’d follow suit. At that time, I didn’t know about NPD. I didn’t know he was playing a game. I only knew that I wasn’t going to grovel for his attention. He ALWAYS broke silence, first. When we were “off”, he always initiated reconciling because I wouldn’t.

When we were “off”, he always initiated reconciling because I wouldn’t. When he’d threaten to “break up/divorce”, I’d agree. He’d quickly “change his mind”. They can’t handle it when you show them you’ll be fine without them. Narcissists can’t love you but they NEED you to love them. THAT is their objective - to receive what they don’t have and can’t give.After being alone for 2+ years after leaving him, I met a Man that I’m certain was a malignant narcissist. He also imposed the silent treatment after I set a boundary. We ended up not speaking for 2 weeks. I was sure that I’d never speak to him again because I refused to play the game. He contacted me, first. I went complete no contact soon after because his behavior was all too familiar… I knew to get away!Adults communicate! Get rid of children in adult bodies who throw temper tantrums and give silent treatments when they don’t get their way! And, always maintain your independence. ALWAYS! That's your leverage in every relationship and with every person you meet. Never rely on others to take care of you, meet your needs, or, make you happy. Putting your life and well being in the hands of a person who can always have a change of heart can backfire on you.I’d like to add one interesting observation I’ve made with these types: If you want a narcissist to leave you alone, they’ll do everything in their power to stick around. They intentionally become a pain in your ass because they know you don’t want/like them, anymore. They dig their heels in in an attempt to get your focus back on them. On the flip side, if you show serious interest, or, desperately want them, they’ll do everything to push you away and run from you. They need people to like/want/entertain/chase them. It validates their fragile ego. It’s an unhealthy push/pull dynamic: “I hate you, but please don’t leave me”!It’s a sick game.
