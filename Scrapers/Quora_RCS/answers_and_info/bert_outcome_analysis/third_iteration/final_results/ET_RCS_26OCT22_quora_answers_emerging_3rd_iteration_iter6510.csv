Evolution is when animals change genetically over long periods of time or through shorter mutations, adaptation is when animals change something in order to survive.Let's use humans as an example. Humans have evolved to walk on two feet, process large amounts of information, and come up with ideas. The evolution is what makes us different from monkeys physically.

Humans have evolved to walk on two feet, process large amounts of information, and come up with ideas. The evolution is what makes us different from monkeys physically. Evolution is something that takes generations. For short lived fruit-flies, evolution can be quick, but for most wild animals, half a century isn't enough for them to evolve because of our technology.Humans have adapted by using tools and technology that allows them to live almost anywhere on the planet without too much difficulty. Adaptation is the term for adjusting to the environment or situation. Sometimes the need to adapt to a new environment causes evolution, but most adaptation is behavioural. They realize that cars are dangerous, unstoppable machines, and they learn to avoid them.","358,983 followers",Sean Kernan,16K,5.6K,727.1M,2016,https://www.quora.com/How-has-late-20th-century-technology-forced-wild-animals-to-evolve
1,"There is anecdotal evidence that many species are adapting to the presence of cars better. It has been observed that hedgehogs are now adapting to run away from cars, while their instinctive defence against animals is to curl up into a spiky ball. The number of feral cats in London seems to be static or increasing, traffic volumes have risen enormously but I have heard that in recent years fewer feral cats have been hit on the roads. Why? The presumption must be that they're adapting to traffic. I can't find evidence on the Internet to support these things I've heard, so I accept that the evidThere is anecdotal evidence that many species are adapting to the presence of cars better.

2,"France has had a lot of concerns surrounding the terror attacks in recent years.One aspect of their concern was elevated with an increasingly sophisticated use of drones by civilians.In turn - they have begun hiring, er, training Golden Eagles - one of the largest birds of prey in the world, with incredible vision and deadly powerful claws.Seriously though - these birds are unbelievably big:Through repeated training sessions, harnessing their speed, ferocity and precision, the French Military currently has several Golden Eagles in their employ.

Selk, Avi)They make it look easy.So why hire birds and not just shoot the drones out of the sky?Well - think about it - where do terrorists commonly target? Crowds of people.The birds targeting these drones will prevent sharp objects, anti-aircraft explosives, and debris from hitting people.And - giant hawks are just awesome.",73 followers,Brittany Ritenour,1.3K,173,521.7K,2019,https://www.quora.com/How-has-late-20th-century-technology-forced-wild-animals-to-evolve
3,"Is the idea of “evolved” indicating “progress” or its “gotten better” or more sophisticated, or evolution meaning better adapted to the existing environment?When you say “music” it’s kind of like the status of “recorded music” has been displaced, even though you mention “technology”. The circumstance of recorded music becoming an integral part of contemporary and consumer culture was a game changer, while yet relying on structural standards of what constitutes pleasing chord progressions and the like.On the other hand, moving beyond “western culture” one finds not only distinct uses of music wIs the idea of “evolved” indicating “progress” or its “gotten better” or more sophisticated, or evolution meaning better adapted to the existing environment?When you say “music” it’s kind of like the status of “recorded music” has been displaced, even though you mention “technology”. The circumstance of recorded music becoming an integral part of contemporary and consumer culture was a game changer, while yet relying on structural standards of what constitutes pleasing chord progressions and the like.On the other hand, moving beyond “western culture” one finds not only distinct uses of music within specific cultures but also different scales, timings, etc. Certainly music has been explored by a variety of artists to such an extent as to provoke questions like “what is music?” or “is that music?”.",0 followers,David Leigh,2.7K,1.1K,9.9M,2020,https://www.quora.com/How-has-late-20th-century-technology-forced-wild-animals-to-evolve
