1,"I don’t think anything is going to replace email in the near future, and probably not in the far future. It’s virtually impossible to use internet technologies without an email address because they are used as identifiers by most websites, cloud services, and even operating systems such as Google Android and Microsoft Windows. Many companies, schools, and colleges also give all their members a unique email address.Email’s unbeatable advantage is that either everyone has an email address, or can easily get one.

It’s virtually impossible to use internet technologies without an email address because they are used as identifiers by most websites, cloud services, and even operating systems such as Google Android and Microsoft Windows. Many companies, schools, and colleges also give all their members a unique email address.Email’s unbeatable advantage is that either everyone has an email address, or can easily get one. There are hundreds of different ways to communicate, including Facebook Messenger, Skype, WhatsApp, Snapchat, Slack and so on, but not even Facebook (1.86 billion monthly active users) has the same reach. Email has an estimated 2.7 billion users with 4.6bn accounts (PDF).Email’s second huge advantage is that, unlike Facebook, nobody owns it. Anyone can set up an email service and use open standards to interoperate with every other email service, without paying anyone a fee. Anyone can write an email client program, or mail-processing utility, without restriction. There are no gatekeepers. The downside, of course, is that most email is spam.Email’s third advantage is that it can be used to distribute any type of file, although some email services may impose file size or other limits. (Gmail, for example, now refuses to send .exe files.) You can send documents and photos to your friends, publishers can send you “rich media” newsletters that look like web pages, airlines can send you PDF files of boarding cards, and so on. The downside is that criminals can send you the same things with added malware.Email’s fourth advantage is that it’s a store and forward system. People don’t have to be online at the same time to exchange emails, and the emails can be kept for future reference. They can also be forwarded to other people, or printed out.Finally, if you could create an alternative open standard system that could do all the things that email can do, it would probably have the same problems. That’s why I don’t think it will happen.",UNKNOWN,Paul K.

And since my crystal ball is in the shop for repairs, I have no idea what it will become.Look at how mail service has evolved since the U.S. mail was delivered by either stage coach or pony express.

3,"For personal use, yes, I think email will be replaced by messaging platforms, such as WhatsApp. But for business use, I think email will continue to be the universal communication tool for work. It will just be better. There’s nothing wrong with the email protocol, it’s the interface that needs work. Email needs to adapt to the way people work today. They want to seamlessly collaborate with their teams, easily access their other apps, and make sure work is not being duplicated.",5 followers,Bill Otto,7.6K,7.5K,43.3M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Will-email-ever-be-fully-replaced-by-other-platforms

6,"Different OS are needed for different systems, so learning to develop Applications in the current popular OS will keep you on top of the current technologies. To illustrate my point, Windows will always be Windows, Android will always be Android.

7,"The tech world is really diverse. There's a lot of technologies out there which are being used today. Many technologies passes away and surely more technologies are on their way for the future.You can't predict what will come next to replace iOS. But if something does replace it, you'll hear rumours about it.Don't try to guess what will come in the future, instead try to do well with what you have at present.

Many. Any given one that I am not currently using probably much forgotten. I really couldn’t tell you.Because it doesn’t matter.About a year ago I dropped working on the Java web service I had developed (and handed it over to some very able younger people) and my job on the day after the handoff was Python on the django framework. I was rusty on Python and had never even looked at django. But it did not take very much time to read about django and refresh my Python and be productive.The key here is, I am not bragging, this is unremarkable. You can do that. That can be you. But you need to move beyond the myopic focus on languages and technologies. Learn how to think about structuring the task, how to make the thing, not it Java or Python or Scala or Algol 60 or whatever. Not in Linux or Windows. Not in .Net or the JVM ecosystem. These are just tools. The tools are important but they are not the skill.The skill is forming programatic things in your mind.If you can do that, whatever comes will be be second nature to you.So, do that.","1,872 followers",Robert Johnson,1.5K,63,433.5K,2017,https://www.quora.com/Will-email-ever-be-fully-replaced-by-other-platforms
