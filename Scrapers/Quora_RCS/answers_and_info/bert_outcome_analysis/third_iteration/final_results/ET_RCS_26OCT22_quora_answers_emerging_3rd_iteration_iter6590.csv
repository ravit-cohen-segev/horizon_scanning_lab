8,"No. The most reasonable explanation for why they are doing jumps with pinpoint accuracy in the new trilogy but in no previous product is because they have improved their navigation computers. Ion cannon appeared to be a new technology when they were used as the Confederation’s secret weapon in the Clone Wars cartoon.

Sure, there are scenes like that, and RO did a better job, but we need it in spades.This next bit might get some people triggered - you have been warned.I like Jedi as much as the next guy, but I want to see a movie that really doesn’t have much to do with the Force or cosmic balance and such. Just show me a squad of Imperial Mudtroopers during the Mimban Campaign, or a couple of clone troopers on some Jedi-forsaken hellhole.This was so awesome. Honestly, just give us a movie about the Mimban Campaign. Draw on WWI imagery, throw is some new vehicles and actual tactics, and call it a great movie.That’s another point - I want to seeAnother thing - somebody get a tactician in Lucasfilm. I swear, go out by Fort Bragg and ask any crusty old Green Beret to advise you - I guarantee one of them would!If we see the Rebels, I want to see guerrilla warfare done right. If we see the Imperials or Clones, show them competently executing small-unit tactics. PLEASE! I’m tired of suicidal charges - show us urban combat, room-clearing, brutal jungle warfare, whatever. Just make it professional.This last point is more directed towards a potential movie following Imperial units.Make the audience like them.*Don’t show them as despicable, evil murderers. Depict them as heroes fighting for what they believe in. Will they question it? Sure. But by the end of the movie, when they pull off the awesome victory, it has to make the audience applaud the troopers, in addition to feeling well-earned.*Obviously there can be those characters everyone hates by design, the antagonists within the unit and such. But you have to at least make the main characters relatable.And that’s the last point - make the characters struggle.They can be well-trained, well-armed, and bolstered with all the morale in the galaxy, but they have to reach a breaking point. They need to be pushed to their absolute limit, and then over the edge - and only then can they drag themselves back up to win the day.So to summarize:And there you have it!

He discovers that Scott’s favourite band is Radiohead.He writes them a letter inviting them to South Park, claiming that Scott is a huge fan who has cancer “in the ass.”Then, he plans to train a pony to bite Scott’s penis off. As you do.Cartman tells Kyle and Stan about his ‘penis plan.’ It will go down at a chilli cook-off Cartman is organising, and Radiohead will arrive right as the deed is done, humiliating Scott.Kyle and Stan warn Scott about Cartman’s plan. Scott makes up a bogus story about a starving pony and convinces his parents to rescue said pony, neutralising the threat.To further humiliate Cartman, he makes chilli with a secret ingredient – pubic hairs of South Park’s teenagers.It’s the day of the chilli cook-off. Scott arrives, and immediately Cartman hands him a ticket for a pony ride. Scott is unperturbed.He tells Cartman that they should taste each other’s chillis.

The moment Eric Cartman transformed from a mildly annoying prick to the devil reincarnate.Cartman says he knows that Scott’s chilli has pubes in them and that he switched bowls and is eating another plate of chilli.Now, witness Cartman’s plan, in his own words:I knew that my friends, Stan and Kyle, would betray me and warn you that the Chili cook-off was a trap.I assumed that they would tell you that I had trained Denkins’ pony to bite off your wiener.What they didn’t tell you was that Denkins is a crazy redneck who shoots trespassers on sight.Knowing that you would try and do something to the pony, I warned Mr Denkins that violent pony killers were in the area.IAnd, I’m afraid that when Mr Denkins spotted them on his property,I came just in time to steal the bodies.And of course, feed you your chilli.
