From the screen, you are reading this on to the TV in your house, the smartwatch on your hand or the phone in your pocket. Children today are exposed to all sorts of technology in their childhood. And like everything else, technology too has its advantages and disadvantages.A child refusing to eat without opening their favourite mobile app is not an uncommon sight. Children are not mindful eaters thus resulting in overeating. This is why at Shanti Juniors, we insist on children bringing meals with them to school so they can be taught how to eat and the nutritious value of food. Sitting with phone, tablets or in front of TV hinders the development of children in both emotional and physical ways. Today, children learn how to unlock a phone before learning how to crawl, roll, walk or talk. If children spend time with family, it leads to the development of their cognitive skills, communication skills and teaches them to be empathetic. Facilities like parental control and filtering should be used so that children do not end up watching content inappropriate for their age.But technology has more positive effects on children behavior if used correctly. When parents have an important task at hand and want to distract their kids, mobile apps like YouTube kids can be helpful. Today, various games are also available on the web which improves critical thinking and hand-eye-co-ordination. Apps like lumosity have personalized games and challenges based on cognitive and math skills. Various games specifically cater to vocabulary and reading skills. These can help children learn new words and enhance their vocabulary.Children tend to do what they see. Parents can set an example for their kids by limiting their phone usage. Technology can be used to spend quality time with children. Parents can use movies and games of their child’s interest to make their bond with children stronger. Interaction via technology can also be done with them. Parents can also use technology to make beautiful memories by introducing children to various cultures, traditions while sitting home comfortably.For the first time in India, Shanti Juniors have a mobile app-based conceptual learning program. This app has all the worksheets and academic aids that can help in children development. It is a gateway of learning in the form of interactive games and puzzles.The features of this app are:• The app is available anywhere at any time. All you have to do is log in to enter the world of fun and learning• The app can help in multi-skill development with its interactive games carefully designed taking the curriculum of children into consideration• You can use this app for easy revision of concepts taught in school.The app has truly revolutionized learning!",223 followers,Krishna Singh,2.5K,180,3.1M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Why-are-PHP-developers-so-slow-in-adopting-new-technologies

It’s sort of an iconic symbol of a whole way of life.The microcircuit was developed for the space program, because computers had to be miniaturized. There were lots of spinoffs from NASA that have seen their way into our everyday life. In a sense, if you pursue something diligently, investing all your heart and soul, craft and wisdom — then you can come up with something of benefit for all the world. An example is medical research into AIDS/HIV. There were some who wagged their tongues: “It’s god’s judgment for their immoral lifestyle.” But doctors and biologists and cytologists and biochemists set to work, investing huge resources and their sincerity to solve the problem. In so doing, the knowledge of cell biology was doubled, through all their investigations and discoveries. Now we’re all benefiting, and the world has become a more humane place.Now the future: Nikola Tesla was “a man before his time.” His ideas and inventions and patents were suppressed, buried, and lay dormant. Many of his discoveries were found to be spot on: Alternating current, the Van de Graaf generator, the electric car, transmission of electrical power at a distance… Now a car is named after him! And now his mysterious science is being resurrected. Now torsion generators, which are for all practical purposes Type 2 Perpetual Motion Machines, declared to be impossible by the scientific establishment, are quietly and steadily operating on farms and homesteads and villages in the Ukraine, Korea, Russia, Switzerland, and the USA. They have proven themselves. It takes about 2 KW boosting input to get the heavy machine spinning, and then you can unplug it and it continues to produce 25 KW of constant electrical power indefinitely. Some of them have been in operation in South Korea for months already, steadily powering factories and homes with no fuel, electricity, solar, wind, chemical, or nuclear input. Where do they get their power from? From the physical vacuum. Cosmic free energy, a grassroots concept and popular expectation on the part of the people of the world, is now a reality!

However, a smart scientist whose name I now forget realized he could force a sheet of nearly molten metal into a cone, called a mandrel, and it would roll up and seal itself as it extruded from the cone and therefore produce regular, standardized pipe in any length necessary. It changed the world.The Merganthaler Hot Linotype Machine - few machines have changed the daily life more than this machine. Merganthaler has been called “the Second Gutenberg” and his machine was the moral and technological equivalent of the Internet today. Before his machine, all type had to be set by hand, letter by letter, with all kinds of mistakes and the inability to easily correct, insert, remove, text or change fonts. The hot linotype machine allowed pressmen to create an entire page of type in one sitting, as fast as he could type, with the ability to change fonts, type size, spelling, add or delete text. Then it produced and entire page of letter type that was put on the newspaper press and thousands of copies could be made. Before this machine, which came out in NYC in the 1880s, newspapers had few pages, were small and rarely published. With the introduction of this machine, the dissemination of information exploded - newspapers could suddenly print any number of pages and up to 8 editions per day, flooding the world with information. The explosion of news and propaganda changed the world for the average person immeasurably.The indoor bathroom with shower and flushing toilet and hot water was a long time in coming but not for trying. People had been trying to create the shower and toilet for centuries but many things had to come together to get it to work. The first shower was made by a man named Cheetham in England and used a foot pump to recycle water. It was terrible but many people used it as an alternative to the completely inadequate, small copper tubs of the time. Many people were involved in the invention of the flush toilet but the key piece of technology that made it work was the air vent of the soil pipe, by Thomas Crapper. The actual toilet was invented by someone else but it was ineffective until there was a U-trap to hold off the gasses and the ability to change air pressure allowing the water box to flush. Scientists of the day said toilets were so dangerous that they had to be kept outside the house or people would die from the sewer gases (until the u-trap was invented). However, the combination of the water box, the u-trap and the vent stack made the modern toilet so possible and popular that by 1904, less then 40 years after all this came about, it was mandated that all new construction had to provide indoor flushing toilets. Nevertheless, by 1938 there were still over 100,000 public outhouses in NYC and the last ones didn’t disappear til the 1930s. I like to point out that toilet paper was invented by Joseph Gayetty in Boston in around 1858 and that was a technology that changed the entire world for everyone! The hot water tank was invented by a man named Ruud at about this same time, the late 1800s and is still the leading hot water tank maker in the world under the name Rheem.Central heating is a rather modern invention and one that changed everyone’e lives. It wasn’t that long ago that chimneys were invented and when they were they were considered an awesome achievement. The pilgrims in America didn’t even have chimneys - they just made a big fire in the middle of the room and had an open ceiling. The fire grate made to lift the fire off the stone floor didn’t come into use until the 1600s and revolutionized heating but it wasn’t until an Austrian scientist named Meissner came up with the principles of heating, convection, the movement of air in the mid 1800s that central heating was revolutionized - and when he developed these things, he was thrown out of the world of science as a quack. He later said, “If you build a better mouse trap people will beat a path to your door - and then beat you to death with it”. Today, Meissner’s work is the basis for all central heating.It didn’t change everyone’s lives so much but the invention of the modern fire engine is interesting too and shows how much people hate change. We get the word “sabotage” from people throwing their shoes (called sabots) into the gears of the textile machines that put craftspeople out of work during the industrial revolution. Later, the first electric train was made in 1835 and when the steam engineers saw it, they destroyed it with hammers out of fear for losing their livelihoods. I’ve already told how Meissner was condemned for coming up with all the right ideas for heating but the funniest story of the fear of change was how, when Newsome invented the modern fire engine pumper (based on steam) in the 1850s in London, the firemen were so frightened for their jobs that they destroyed it. Newsome was discouraged so he brought it to NYC where the firemen saw what it could do and feared for their jobs and destroyed it so he brought it to Boston where the firemen saw what it could do and feared for their jobs so they destroyed it. So in desperation he gave an entire fleet to Cincinatti where the firemen were so afraid for their jobs that they pushed the entire fleet of fire engines into the river.And so another technology that changed lives was the Corliss Steam Engine. This machine was necessary for artificial light. Note that Humphrey Davy first invented artificial light in 1820 with the electric arc but in those days there was no rechargeable battery (which they called “piles) and it took an entire room of batteries, used once, to provide a couple of hours of light. (The rechargeable battery was eventually invented in France in the 1890s and made it possible for the electric car starter first put on a Cadillac in 1912, putting the steam car out of business). Nevertheless, when steam came along it became possible to make electricity and entire cities were lit up with arcs long before Swan and Edison made the light bulb - but without constant, regulated electric power, the arc and the bulb (not to mention the street car) were irrelevant. The Corliss Steam Engine provided the power necessary for everything and artificial light is the single greatest technology that has changed human life, for better or worse, since the Gutenberg Press and the invention of the wheel. (As it turns out, it’s not the wheel that was the critical invention - it was the axle. Having a wheel was easy. Attaching it to a cart was difficult to figure out. Think about it.)","284,854 followers",James Altucher,9.5K,878,91.7M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-three-major-scientific-and-technological-developments-in-the-world-or-in-the-Philippines-that-created-a-large-impact-on-your-daily-life

I wrote an article on some Philippine infrastructural projects.and here:As today's concerns are usually focused on the future, and what we can do to help aid Earth so that we can have some extra years on the planet, smart cities have been commonly proposed ideas now. And the Philippines wants to make sure that they can jump in on this idea as well by constructing the biggest Smart city that could rival Singapore and Dubai.The Philippines has many benefits of being an island nation, and nowadays, I think Filipinos, and especially Filipino scientists and engineers have realized that they can harness the power from volcanoes, winds, the sun, and tidal waves, to generate mass production of renewable energy. This is the central idea for the Philippines ’ smart city. and the idea of a high-tech and advanced Philippines has become a bigger motivation for Filipinos in the passing years.Clark city has already begun its work on creating tech and devices that may very well kickstart the Philippines ’ very own phone manufacturing company and possibly get an introduction into the global market.So, the possibility of the Philippines becoming a high-tech country that is based on renewable and eco-efficient power isn’t out of question. I personally think that they have done a good job in advancing in this sector in contrast to some of its other neighbors. Only time will tell if the Philippines will be able to reach this point of developmental success but when it does, it will mark a significant moment in its history.","30,835 followers",Anjali Kriplani,617,505,5M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-three-major-scientific-and-technological-developments-in-the-world-or-in-the-Philippines-that-created-a-large-impact-on-your-daily-life
