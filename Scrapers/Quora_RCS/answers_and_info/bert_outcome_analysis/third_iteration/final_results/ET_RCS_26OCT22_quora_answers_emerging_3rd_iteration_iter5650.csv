It is an entity that is legally allowed to sell products and services. Companies are either privately owned or publicly traded.Digitization is a competitive strategy of the company, a plan, and its resources are made available to be successful in its execution.A digital company uses ICT intensely to competeCompanies have always needed leaders, now they must know how to read the signs of change and design a roadmap for their transformation. Going digital does not mean introducing a new sales channel or, in this case, communication with your customers, but rather a new way of doing business, in which ICTs are intensely present in operations, sales, marketing, and innovation.Digitization is a competitive strategy of the company, a plan, and its resources are made available to be successful in its execution. It is to prepare our business for the new competitive world, a world in which disruptive cycles are getting shorter, in which agility is essential.Defining a digital strategy will mean identifying the changes that will occur in our business model, as well as the opportunities that will be generated from new ones.Initially, companies incorporated technologies into their processes to reduce their costs and increase productivity, later they incorporated information and communication technologies (ICT) to manage the information flows generated by their business activities, now they are immersed in a digitization process, as a result of the maturation of technologies and their incorporation into the lifestyle of consumers. ThusIt is not a fashion, it is a new way of doing business that is born from the expansion of the use of ICT by individuals and organizations. It is not optional, all companies will be digital sooner or later. The association of digital with the concept of an emerging company is not correct, every company must be concerned about the phenomenon, all companies have the opportunity and the challenge of strategically incorporating ICTs into their business models. No matter the sector, they will not be able to compete in the coming years without digitizing their processes, their products and services, and their infrastructures.Companies will need to be able to develop adaptive strategies, avoid commodities, create sustainable differentiation, create a culture of innovation, and attract customers and employees. To do this, they will need to digitize their portfolio of products and services, the way they do marketing, the way they communicate with their customers, how they capture knowledge, how they develop their capabilities, and how they innovate in all areas.Those who want to lead or just survive in their markets will need to define their digital transformation plan, and this will ultimately affect their entire organization.",5 followers,Joel Kaplan,555,0,0,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-impact-of-digital-marketing-emerging-digital-technologies-on-consumers-and-businesses

What has changed is the frequency with which new technology arrives. For example, one wonders how many educational establishments bought terminals, then desktops, then laptops, then tablets and now want to offer only some from of cloud.Does this affect education outside the IT department? That would depend on the general approach to education. If you view education as that process during which teachers persuade students to be interested in subject material so that they are motivated to explore, to discover and thus have the excitement of learning, then the technology is likely to be irrelevant. If you see teaching as a process whose existence depends upon having the most modern of equipment or else it will fail to attract customers, then you will think differently. I know which site I’d prefer to work at and learn at.Being a mathematician, I’m very happy with blackboard and chalk and in some ways prefer this to whiteboard and marker - and certainly prefer both of those over electronic whiteboard. The additional work required to make an EWB work well enough to add to lessons does not, in my experience, do much to improve the understanding of a class. There are some circumstances where it does, but a video might achieve as much and an internet-based worksheet might be better still.We need also to make a nod towards that school of thought that says the social interaction at school is no longer relevant and argues that all learning could be screen-based and remote. Much could, but then as a society we would lose those things that mixing with others brings. It may be that there is sense in separating these components of growing up. One feature of teaching we would lose is that externally applied enthusiasm that generates interest for a group of people. And a lot of spontaneity. Ideas can be generated in remote learning but the response is usually so slow that the spark doesn’t light anyone’s fire. That may change, too. At the moment I see remote learning as great for jumping through hoops, for reaching a defined target (but not exceeding such) - but nearly asocial.Perhaps you would share a response on here?","246,862 followers",Dushka Zapata,1.5K,8.5K,232.5M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-impact-of-digital-marketing-emerging-digital-technologies-on-consumers-and-businesses
