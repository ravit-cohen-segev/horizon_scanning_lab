1,"Maybe, maybe not.

If you update, you are installing a computer virus.Why are they on big-name, reputable sites?Let me lift the curtain and let you in on an ugly secret about how the Web works: The owners of big-name reputable sites (I think you mean “update your flash player.”Adobe Flash is now officially dead. There are no more updates. Every single one of these messages you see is now 100% guaranteed to be fake. If you update, you are installing a computer virus.Why are they on big-name, reputable sites?Let me lift the curtain and let you in on an ugly secret about how the Web works: The owners of big-name reputable sites (by which I mean the Delta Airlines site, Forbes, the Wall Street Journal, and others) know a lot less about what’s on their sites than you think.These fake malware downloaded usually come from banner ads. Poisoned banner ads are very, very common, because the billionaire owners of big-name sites don’t want to spend the money to have the banner advertising sales handled in house and they sure as hell don’t want to pay a team of expensive computer security people.So here’s how it works:Say you’re the CEO of the Wall Street Journal. You want to have a Web site and you want to sell banner ads on your Web site.You could hire a team of salespeople to call everyone you can think of who might want to buy banner ads on the Wall Street Journal site. And you could hire a team of Web programmers to implement the banner ad code on your site. And you could hire a team of designers to design the ads and a few security experts to examine and vet them ads.Or…You could just buy your ads from a banner ad broker.The banner ad broker sells web banner ads. That’s it. That’s all they do.The banner ad broker says “all you have to do is tell us how much money you charge and put one line of our code on your web pages and we’ll do everything else.”You as CEO no longer need to hire teams of people! You’ve just saved the company $250,000 a year, so you can give yourself a million-dollar bonus, buy another Ferrari for your collection, and go golfing.But here’s the thing:Now a banner ad company run from some guy’s garage in Florida has access to put anything they want onto your site.You think that banner ad company hires security experts to vet all the banner ads? Ah HA ha ha ha ha ha ha!Now say I’m a Russian criminal wanting to spread computer viruses.I set up a fake flower delivery company with a fake Web site. (Not a hypothetical example. One high-profile case of malware spread from big-name sites was actually done using a fake flower delivery company.)I go to Super Cheapie Cheapie Fly By Night Banner Ad Broker Incorporated and say “hello, I’d like to run these banner ads for my flower delivery service on the Wall Street Journal site please.”The guy who runs Super Cheapie Cheapie Fly By Night Banner Ad Broker Incorporated from his garage looks at my banner ad. It’s a banner ad for a flower delivery web site. He shrugs, clicks a few buttons, and starts running my banner ad on The Wall Street Journal.Oh, but he didn’t look very closely at my ad. He’s a college kid running an ad broker from his garage. So he didn’t notice that my ad has booby trapped code. Starting Tuesday at midnight, it loads a malicious script from a server in Belarus that redirects to a “You must update Flash player!!!” site.And now all of a sudden, boom! The Wall Street Journal page is serving up computer viruses. All because they didn’t want to handle selling ads in house, so they subbed it out to some guy in a garage with a nice-looking business card and a firm handshake, and let that guy in his garage insert who knows what kind of code on the Wall Street Journal site without vetting it.This has happened a lot. Huge big-name sites, including The Wall Street Journal, have served up malware from poisoned web banner ads.The industry has tried to clean up its act, and big sites have started buying ...","220,640 followers",Franklin Veaux,960,47.3K,783.1M,2021,https://www.quora.com/An-engineer-is-tasked-with-building-a-small-probe-that-can-deorbit-and-land-anywhere-the-moon-Would-the-engineer-stand-a-chance-of-succeeding-if-only-a-single-Arduino-board-is-available-for-control-of-the-probe

So loading a website takes AT LEAST 6 minutes.But when Earth and Mars are at their furthest, there is a 22 minute one-way radio trip…and a 44 minute round-trip.It’s actually even worse than that - when Earth and Mars are in opposition - the Sun is between the two and you can’t transmit any direct messages between them at all. Instead, there would have to be a satellite somewhere off to the side - which would increase the delay to an hour or more.Even if you’re really patient, most networks drop the connection if a reply doesn’t appear in a minute or so.All of this means that there is essentially no way to access the Earth Internet from Mars unless you’re prepared to spend weeks trying to get what you need.Most likely, Mars would have it’s own Internet - and the more important web sites would be copied to Mars when changes are made. But smaller, more obscure sites aren’t going to be able to do that - so the vast numbers of fascinating quirky places just won’t be reachable unless you plan days in advance.So you’d have fast access to (say) Wikipedia - but the pages you’d be able to read would be a day, a week, a month out of date.BANDWIDTH:These long delays are one problem - but another is overall bandwidth. If there are only a handful of people on Mars - then sending emails, texts and tweets back to Earth wouldn’t be a problem…but once you have thousands of people doing that - the radio link between Mars and Earth would soon become choked by the volume of data.At that point - you may be sharply limited in what you can send back to Earth.300 million miles is no easy gap to cross.MARS-NET:If SpaceX continues to play a major part in the colony - then it’s likely that they’d put StarLink satellites into Mars orbit - which could provide a GPS-like navigation service and fast Internet access over the entire planet.For talking to other people on Mars - accessing web sites on Mars - then there is really no reason why it shouldn’t be as fast as here on Earth.For large bulk data - it may be that we ship things like movies, TV shows and such with the resupply ships that’ll show up every 2.2 years. So a burst of new stuff arrives.CONCLUSION:Ultimately - it’s going to be tough for the culture of Earth and Mars to stay together. Sooner or later, there will be different memes on Mars - new social media - new web sites - that will scarcely interact with Earth web sites.When you can only talk easily with fellow Martians - they’ll be your friends - and you’ll stop needing to talk to Earth.Mars will start to use words differently - give it 100 years and who knows how wide the gulf will become.",146 followers,Nick Tresidder,2.1K,601,416.6K,2020,https://www.quora.com/An-engineer-is-tasked-with-building-a-small-probe-that-can-deorbit-and-land-anywhere-the-moon-Would-the-engineer-stand-a-chance-of-succeeding-if-only-a-single-Arduino-board-is-available-for-control-of-the-probe

7,"Yes but the signal delay could be many minutes. It would probably make sense to take copies of as much of the Internet as possible and set up a server on Mars, with occasional updates and refreshment from Earth.

8,"Yes - it is basically impossible.But the problem isn’t with the state of our physics knowledge - it’s a matter of computational complexity and lack of perfect input data for a fundamentally “chaotic” system.The first difficultyYes - it is basically impossible.But the problem isn’t with the state of our physics knowledge - it’s a matter of computational complexity and lack of perfect input data for a fundamentally “chaotic” system.The first difficultyCollecting all of that data with sufficient accuracy to solve the problem will be very difficult - and because problems involving turbulent airflows and flexible materials are mathematically “chaotic” - there is extreme sensitivity to those initial conditions, and small errors in your input data will rapidly blow up into larger and larger errors in the results as the simulation proceeds.The second difficultyBut don’t go away with the idea that this is a flaw in physics - it’s really not. We fully understand how paper flexes and how air molecules flow and interact. The physics is quite well understood.The problem is essentially the same as weather forecasting. We don’t have perfect information about the airflow right now - and the further in time we predict ahead, the more any small error in our information will throw the prediction off-track.The well known “Butterfly Effect” applies here. The moment when you released the sheet of paper from your hand, your heart beat - the small additional flow of blood through your forearm caused a small ripple along your skin as that blood pulsed through your wrist. This started a tiny pressure wave that propagated upwards to the underside of the sheet of paper - giving it a very slight upward curve - which in turn changed the pressure of the air above that point - starting an airflow away from there - which in turn caused a frictional force across the surface of the paper that started a slight rotation…etc…etc…the end result of which is that the paper lands text-side up instead of text-side down.Did we consider the effect of your heartbeat in the initial conditions? Probably not.It’s simply that this problem has vast numbers of degrees of freedom.Now - if you want the answer for a perfectly uniform sheet of material with initial conditions described by abstract equations - and with a sufficiently powerful super-computer - we could undoubtedly produce a convincing simulation of a piece of paper doing it’s thing…but why would this be useful? We still couldn’t do this with any degree of accuracy for a real problem.But why would you even want to? A prediction might be useful - but if the data that drives it is unobtainable - or if the calculation takes too long - then we can’t make use of it.",UNKNOWN,Jess H.
