From the well documented Rendelsham Forrest UFO incidents, one of the Military officials who had a close encounter with a triangular probe reported that from a telepathic exchange that he had with the entity or probe craft when he touched it, he posed the question: who are you? The response from the probe was: “You are us. We are you.”. One possibility from this exchange would suggest that the us from the far future traveling back in time. For what reason(s)?

Their planet, the meanwhile, is also aging and advancing, and may indeed even be a dead world if and when they ever returned. So they arrive here to do what, exactly? Take some samples? Then go where? Back home? It would be like walking from Anchorage, Alaska to Orlando, Florida, taking a few snapshots of the Disney World gate, and then walking back home. What’s the point?So time travel. How exactly does this work? I have seen a thousand time machines in movies and TV shows. How do they work? How can you leave a place and end up in the same place at a different time? Would you not find the planet, indeed the entire solar system, yes the entire galaxy is n ot in the same place? How exactly do you not go back in time and turn up in the middle of some star, or the blackness of the void of space somewhere? Time travel would make no sense if you did not go someplace whose history you know. So how do you target it? And whatEven if these overwhelming odds could be overcome, the possibility of creating a paradox is a lot easier than has been portrayed in time travel shows. Do you realize that if your parents waited just a little longer in the sex act (something your mother may have wanted) the exact sperm that fertilized her egg might be a different one of the millions of swimmers and you would cease to existSo you have missed your calling.

It strikes me that since 8,000 years ago, the human race has been racing as fast as it could.Maybe the only brake on that progress has been the interminable religious wars that have occurred without any evidence of positive accomplishment or two world wars fought over empire and nationalist sentiments. But even they didn’t slow things down very much.The Plague was a drastic realignment of civilization and probably did a lot to usher in the Renaissance and later the Enlightenment.I could go on. So, I don’t understand how you could say that the process of where we are today took so long.

Our days were mostly consumed with subsistence and learning how to express abstraction. There was no such thing as abstraction before we came along. We had to invent how to talk about the future, plan, and communicate with other tribes without killing each other. There were lots of things to work out with this new hardware upstairs.Finally, we learned how to control plants on a wide scale, i.e. agriculture begins. That was about 10,000 years ago. At this point, we have an abundance of food and we don’t have to chase animals around the land all year. So, we’ve really only had 10,000 years to develop anything resembling technology. Before we had an abundance of calories, we were too busy surviving and figuring out what to Do with a brain like this before that.If you think what has happened in 10,000 years, it is almost mind blowing. Everything in history, everything that has ever been invented, written, or built was effectively done in the last 10,000 years. Wow, incredible!Last thing, it was really industrialization that led to the acceleration of technological development. You have to have machines to build new machines. “Machine shops”, where they build parts for other machines, took off. From the early part of last century on, we built a ridiculous number of machines and figured out how to use electricity as a power source. Remember, that’s only about 100 years ago. Another wow. So, in 100 years, we went from a light bulb to a computer doing billions of calculations a second (that’s on almost everybody’s desk top). We built a huge machine, stuck a few computers, and some bottled up fire in it, and flew some humans to our moon. In about 100 years.

We are benefiting from what people did 10,000 years ago, not just what has happened in the electronic age.As an analogy, if you start out with one penny and you want to double your pennies until you get 100 additional pennies, it takes more doubling starting with one penny than if you started with 80.Technology works the same way. A sharpened stone allows you to cut wood and build a fence. A fence allow you to keep animals for milk and meat. Since you don’t have to hunt, you have more time for agriculture. Agriculture allows you to grow so much food that a few farmers can supply a civilization, allowing others to be carpenters and so on.You get exponential growth. When you start out with a penny or a sharpened stone, it seems like forever before you have a hundred dollars, but when you have a hundred dollars or a civilization, it doesn’t take much to get the next 100 or additional civilization because you are starting with more.","5,990 followers",Jens Böttiger,566,2.6K,17.6M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Would-it-be-of-most-concern-to-you-if-the-currently-unexplained-UFO-sittings-were-of-extraterrestrial-origin-or-advanced-technology-from-China-or-Russia-Why

24,"$1,000,000 turns into about $580,000 after federal and state taxes and some investment fees. I would add it to my investment account and live a little more comfortable for the next 20 years. It should leave enough to go to a nice facility when I inevitably need the extra help.",0 followers,Kelly South,1.7K,340,12.9M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Did-someone-from-the-future-accidentally-leave-behind-some-advanced-technology-that-started-this-whole-UFO-cover-up-human-chapter

26,"$1 million isn't very much. Even if you got the whole million, no taxes taken out or after tax.I wouldn't be able to buy the two additional houses, one at the beach, and one in the mountains where it snows, and be able to support those. That's my big lottery plans.No, with a million dollars I'd buy a different house, a new or newer car ( I'm all for letting someone else take the first couple years of depreciation). I'm nearing retirement so I'd figure out how much I want to draw off that for the next 30 years , and put that aside ( 1,000 a month for 30 years is 360,000).

I suspect there's not going to be a whole lot left, maybe 100,000 or two at most.

27,"One million is a lot of money but you’re not crazy rich. Let’s assume it’s one million after taxes. I would pay off my house, a few bills that I have, buy a reasonable new car, bank the rest, possibly quit my current job for a good part time job and travel on my days off.",0 followers,Tony Nguyen,915,216,2M,2022,https://www.quora.com/Would-it-be-of-most-concern-to-you-if-the-currently-unexplained-UFO-sittings-were-of-extraterrestrial-origin-or-advanced-technology-from-China-or-Russia-Why
