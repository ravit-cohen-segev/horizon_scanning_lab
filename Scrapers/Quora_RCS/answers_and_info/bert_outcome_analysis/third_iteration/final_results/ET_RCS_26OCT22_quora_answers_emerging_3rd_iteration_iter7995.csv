I was nowhere close to even a regional-Olympiads, let alone International!I started solving problems during my physics club. It took me dozens of problems before I could up my level. I remember one day how I happily approached my teacher and told her: “Fast forward, two years and I was solving international Olympiad problems in ease!How? What did I do? What’s the secret?The secret is…JUST KEEP GOING.Honestly, just keep solving problems and I guarantee that you would get better in this.But DON’T just look up the solutions, and think that you solved the problem without understanding it and move on.You need to think about the problems but most importantly you have to getInstead, ask yourself, “why couldn’t I solve it? How could I have solved this?”Maybe it’s lack ofMaybe you had to thinkOn and on, you do this, and your problem solving would increase. And not only it would be good in physics, but in math, in computer science, and in life.The key point, however, is this:EVERYONE STARTS FROM THE BOTTOM.Nobody is born solving complex problems. Like any skill, problem-solving is developed.Just keep doing it and you WILL get there.

1,"The four-color theorem is the most famous mathematical problem to have been solved with the assistance of computers. The original proof, by Appel and Haken in 1976, required the examination of 1,936 “reducible configurations”. A more recent proof(some of the unavoidable, reducible configurations in the cited paper by Robertson et al.)The second-most-famous problem of this type is likely the Kepler Conjecture.

A more recent proof(some of the unavoidable, reducible configurations in the cited paper by Robertson et al.)The second-most-famous problem of this type is likely the Kepler Conjecture. In 1611, Johannes Kepler wrote a paper titled “On the six-cornered snowflake”, in which he conjectured that the densest packing of spheres in a given volume is achieved using the standard cubic or hexagonal close packings (which share the same density).This problem was open for 350 years. In 1998, Thomas Hales announced a proof which relied on significant computer calculations. Refereeing his paper was a monumental task which never really concluded; it was eventually published under a disclaimer that the referees are “99% certain” that the proof is correct.Motivated by a desire to settle the matter with full certainty, Hales initiated the Flyspeck project(Prof. Thomas Hales and a hexagonal lattice. ImageMany other problems and conjectures were settled with the aid of computers, but they are not as famous as these two.
