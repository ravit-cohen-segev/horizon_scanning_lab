0,"The if part is very iffy. Look around you. Is there anything there that could be 3D printed? Most everything around us has to meet certain tolerances, thousandths of an inch, be made of durable metals, have smooth surface finishes, and be manufacturable at very low cost and in huge volumes. Almost nothing even begins to qualify to be 3D printed, and certainly not at a lower cost. Around me I see pens, lights, light switches, walls, drapes, books, bookshelves, bed, pillows. Not a single one of those things can be 3D printed, or if it can, it's going to cost ten times as much and not be as good.Continue ReadingThe if part is very iffy. Look around you.

6,"A2A: The biggest two civilization-changing technologies I see on the horizon are space flight, especially the commercial and industrial use of space rather than science and research; and biomedical technology, particularly with respect to radical longevity.Cheap access to orbit and beyond is a game changer. Starship, and whatever comes after Starship, opens whole new avenues for commercial exploitation of space in ways likely to be way more far-reaching than we can imagine right now.

The first person to figure out asteroid mining will likely become the wirld’s first trillionaire.Biomedical technology right now is about where computers were in the 1940s and 1950s. We’re laying the foundation for a whole new kind of science in a way similar to what pioneers like Alan Turing did with computer science, and we’re likely to see a rapid point of inflection in biomedical technology similar to what happened with computers in the 80s and 90s.That’s going to have even more far-reaching impacts on society: radically extended lifespan! Reliable broad-spectrum antivirals and anti-cancer treatments! Precisely tailored gene therapy! Personalized medicine! Biomedical nanotechnology!What will those two things look like? Dunno. Imagine someone in 1954 trying to predict the era of smartphones, the Internet, and Facebook. There’s no way to anticipate anything except the broadest outlines of these technologies, but they’re coming.","135,501 followers",Hector Quintanilla,582,1.2K,88.5M,2022,https://www.quora.com/What-do-you-think-is-the-next-big-thing-We-have-the-personal-computer-the-Internet-and-the-smartphone
7,"No, “""block chain” is well understood in computer science. Crypto currencies, based on block chain technology, are the next big thing in finance and economics.

8,"Robotics is going to be new future in technology and ofcourse its worldwide application. Considering the rate at which our technology is developing, robotics is going to be popular option among visionaries. Let's just keep our fingers crossed and hope the robots in real life won't turn out the way they show in science fictional movies. The last thing we want is terminator on our lawns and judgment day in near future. :p",0 followers,Glen Boston,655,71,1.7M,2014,https://www.quora.com/What-do-you-think-is-the-next-big-thing-We-have-the-personal-computer-the-Internet-and-the-smartphone

It’s actually pretty simple.DockerKubernetesThat’s it. Oh, and it’s open-source.This sort of abstraction and orchestration is perfect in the era of cloud computing. It means developers can run software on their local computers and be confident that it will run in the cloud as well.Kubernetes has its drawbacks, though. It has a pretty steep learning curve, and it requires a good bit of administration to keep a cluster running in production. Because of that, I think it will be replaced by something else pretty soon. Perhaps something running on top that uses Kubernetes as a backend while simplifying setup and administration. Something like Azure Kubernetes Service, but perhaps even simpler and open-source.","45,622 followers",David Seidman,790,3.6K,85.1M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-do-you-think-is-the-next-big-thing-We-have-the-personal-computer-the-Internet-and-the-smartphone
