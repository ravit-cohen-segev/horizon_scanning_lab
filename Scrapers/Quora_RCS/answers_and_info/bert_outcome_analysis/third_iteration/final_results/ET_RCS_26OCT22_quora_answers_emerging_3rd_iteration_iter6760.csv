0,No one has “conquered” the Moon. We just we went for a few strolls and a dune buggy ride.The most important technology that came from the space program was miniaturization of computers.

6,The most likely answer is that your understanding of evolution is wrong.Humans are evolving right now. The ability to digest milk as an adult and see the color red are spreading throughout the species. Populations in geographic regions continue to wage war with locally endemic diseases.

7,"We didn’t. Lactose tolerance is spreading through the population, wisdom teeth are becoming less common, and the persistence in adulthood of an artery in the forearm which was formerly only present in infants is becoming more common. Different populations with different diets are also developing slightly different digestive enzymes.But even in a state of nature humans evolve only slowly, because we have a long generation time, a small number of offspring and a limited number of partners, and nowadays we’ve slowed down even more because our technology insulates us against many selection pressurWe didn’t.

11,"Yes. That started with the discovery of fire and the technology of cooking. Cooking releases more nutrients from food, enabling larger, more nutrient-hungry brains.

12,"You'll need to define ""meaningful technology."" It would seem to me that meaningful technology predates Homo sapiens sapiens. Our not-quite-human ancestors were already using fire, something no other species (well, genus anyway) has ever done, and we were making unprecedented use of stone tools.

13,"First, I’ve read or heard from qualified sources that there exists technologies that are so advanced that they’d boggle the mind…they simply aren’t for public consumption yet. Technology is business and can be expensive. That translates to ‘the cost of the R&D for the current technology hasn’t been paid for yet. Until it is, ‘replacement tech’ or tech that will make current tech ‘obsolete’ isn’t marketed.

14,"We can only evolve technology so fast. One reason is that it simply takes time to properly test each new thing and make it work properly. Virtually no prototype has ever worked right the first time around.If the several hundred devices I have developed only every one was market ready with the first version. Many times when a prototype is shown, new features are determined necessary. I have had some go through 15 prototype spins before hitting the market.It takes an incredible amount of work to get new technology out the door and there are only so many if us who can do this work.As well like IWe can only evolve technology so fast.
