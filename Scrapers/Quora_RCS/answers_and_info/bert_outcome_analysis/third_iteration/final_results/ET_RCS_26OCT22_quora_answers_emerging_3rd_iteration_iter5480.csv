0,"OK firstly, jobs are infinite, so it’s highly unlikely that anything could possible take infinite jobs. That is, what is a job? A job is providing someone with something they want but do not yet have. Since people will always want something they do not yet have, no matter how much stuff they already have, there will always be jobs to provide that - infinite jobs.

Then you would have all the time available to you do do as you with, with all of your stuff, without having to take time away to go to a job. Pretty effing awesome.Now that’s assuming by purpose, you mean economic purpose. At that point, what would be the purpose in having an economic purpose? As for personal purpose? Well, I don’t know about anyone else, but I can certainly think of hundreds of things I would be doing with that time if I had that time available to do those things.

I think AI will kill jobs, and over time, AI might kill most “jobs” as we know them. I think that people are somewhat complacent in regard to the economic impact of AI, and will likely be ill-prepared for the changes we have to adapt to in the not-so-distant future.First, let's start with the comparisons to machinery and automation. They did indeed put factory workers out of work. In that respect, I agree AI today is similar in many applications, replacing workers who have less specialized skills, perhaps call center operators, office assistants (in a limited extent), and maybe soon, taxi drivers and truck drivers. But I would argue that AI is fundamentally different from machinery or most of the other analogies commonly made when answering this question, because AI is growing and is unlikely to stop growing. It's growing in breadth (of applications and industries), in geographic and economic scope, and in power (it's capacity to address increasingly complex tasks). A more fitting analogy would be machinery in an automobile plant that not only made the parts one day, but then learned how to assemble them the week after, and then how to design cars a year later.I think that there is little that is out of reach for advanced AI of the future. Let's leave the question of the AI singularity alone for now. Instead, I think that deep learning efforts at Google and elsewhere are making AI systems learn faster and faster, with a growing rate of acceleration. Advanced AI can now address increasingly complex tasks including medical diagnosis, stock market trading, weather prediction and human behavioral modeling. Very soon, it will be able to take the place of certain types of teachers, and find a role in education. It can already deal with complex systems in software and mathematics, and seems to be only limited in applications that require interactions with the physical world (sensors are still imperfect), and with people.So without projecting too far into the future, we can ask the question, what jobs will NOT be killed by AI? Jobs that involve labor are already (or soon to be) replaced. Jobs that require logical reasoning are being replaced, albeit at a slower rate. What are the qualities that humans have that cannot be captured by AI? Perhaps creativity, emotional responses? So perhaps researchers in academia will survive longer than most, and artists (though AI stylistic mimicry is already quite impressive and their results enjoyable), and counselors/psychologists/case workers, and decision makers like CEOs who cannot be predictable or error prone. And hopefully software engineers and algorithm designers who develop AI systems.This leaves a very, very small portion of today's jobs intact. Many say: we just need to train people to fill higher level jobs created by AI, e.g. Programmers, ML researchers. But this is no easy feat. The US educational system is struggling to meet the demands created by advanced technology today. This failure is in part responsible for the economic divide plaguing the country today. The challenge of educating the public for a job market that is both decreasing in scope and increasing in complexity, is nothing we've ever faced before.I am far from original in this opinion. But if I had to guess, I would say that AI will put far more people out of work than we can (re)train in time. That will have significant economic repercussions as corporations seeking to minimize cost will do so at the cost of rising unemployment. There will need to be dramatic changes in social policies in order to avert large scale economic disaster, first dramatic rises in minimum wage, then eventually some type of universal income/welfare. It's the kind of change that requires significant leadership in our government, something that seems woefully absent today.",35 followers,Noah Green,578,0,0,2017,https://www.quora.com/If-artificial-intelligence-other-emerging-technologies-take-all-the-jobs-what-would-be-your-purpose

Not going to happen. Making AIs as smart as people is exceedingly hard and it’s not soon in the cards. I say this as an AI researcher who works on these problems and I see how truly difficult they are. We can, and will solve some of the problems but we are a long way from AIs that can match human minds. An AI that plays Go better than humans is buildable because the game is a closed small universe.

But without the ""wake up"" part.Below I describe what real AI is.If we want to understand the “existential threat” we first need to know what AI is.Then, if you are at a cocktail party and someone says, ""but what if robots are intelligent?"" you can argue with facts, mixed with a little bit of alcohol.---------A) STATISTICSStatistics is at the heart of most AI programs.Just like statistics is at the heart of a lot of human decision making.For instance, if you see clouds in the sky, your brain thinks: ""Hmmm, the last 100 times I saw clouds this dark, it usually meant it was about to rain"".When you think like that, you are using statistics to make the decision: ""I should _probably_ go inside now.""I'll give an AI example: Siri or Alexa. How does Alexa understand the words you just said?In 1989 I was visiting Carnegie Mellon to decide if I would go to graduate school there.One of the graduate students, Kai-Fu-Lee (now one of the most famous investors in the world and I would check out his excellent recent TED talk on AI) showed me what he was working on:It was speech recognition for the 60 or so commands that might happen on a Navy battleship (ten guesses as to who was funding his project).When you say the word ""Fire!"" a sound wave is created. When you say the word ""hello"" a sound wave that looks different is created.If 100 people say ""Fire"" and 100 people say ""hello"", all of those sounds waves are stored in a database.Now, if a brand new person says ""Hello"" the computer program needs to determine if that person said ""Hello"" or ""fire"".There might be 10 different attributes of every sound wave. It breaks the new person's sound wave into those 10 attributes.Then it compares that ""vector"" of 10 attributes with all of the vectors in its database for ""Hello"" and ""Fire!""It uses a statistical technique called ""Hidden Markov Analysis"" to determine if the sound wave is more like the ""hello""s in the database or more like the ""Fire!"" in the database.Then it says to itself, ""This guy said ""Hello"". ""It then has a line of code that says, ""If someone says ""Hello"" Then say ""Hello"" back"".Additionally, it adds your ""Hello"" to its database.Your ""Hello"" might be slightly different than the other 100 ""Hello""s so it just learned a new way to say ""Hello"". That gives it greater ability in the future to recognize the word ""hello"".In other words, it ""learned"".So it used Statistics to hear you, code to respond to you, and database technology to learn. There's no real intelligence there but it feels like it's intelligence.Multiply that by 30 years and millions of patterns and computers a million times faster and you have Alexa and Siri in today's kitchens.Ask ""Siri"" what gender it is.-----B) EVALUATION FUNCTIONI just mentioned about language recognition. But how does a self-driving car work?Every second it has to make a decision. Does it move forward? Does it brake? Does it swerve to avoid an accident? Does it turn left?How does it get from point A to point B?1) Google Maps. - Using GPS it knows where it is. And it puts itself on Google Maps.2) List all of the possible routes. This is a ""hard"" problem in the mathematical sense (there's no way for it to guess the fastest route. It has to list each route and then sort by the shortest. )But now computers are so fast what would normally be a slow decision (drive me from this corner in Piscataway, New Jersey to the capital building of Sacramento, California) now just takes seconds.3) Waze. Use Waze to eliminate the routes with too much traffic.4) Start driving.5) Statistics: Every microsecond it uses statistics to see if there is blank space or an object that must be avoided or a traffic sign that must be followed.6) Decide what to do according to the code. For each traffic sign, it has code that tells it what to do (if a sign says ""Stop"" it Stops for a second, uses Statistics to see if any traffic is happening on its sides (with radar and cameras to provide the images). )If there is a person standing in front of it, it might just stop.If there's traffic it didn't expect, it might trigger the program to re-route.If it's blank space it will just keep going.If there's a baby crossing the street and it has to swerve to avoid hitting it, but if swerving will cause the car to hit a truck, killing the passenger in the car, then the ""AI"" of the car is dependent on the ethical decisions of the programmer of the car.In other words, in every situation, it determines it's options, then uses an ""evaluation function"" programmed by a coder, to determine which option has the most successful outcome (move the trip forward, don't kill anyone).Eventually the evaluation function will NOT be programmed by a human coder.Instead, through thousands of experiences of other self-driving cars, the experiences plus the outcomes will all be put into a central database.When a new experience is encountered, the code will look up that experience in the database and the database will spit back the best possible outcome.The code will learn statistically what the best outcomes are of each possibly decision and change the code accordingly and send updates to all self-driving cars.-----C) TREESThe hardest game in the world is a board game called GO. With chess, if a computer can evaluate a billion possibilities a second, it can be a world champion level player.But a Go game can involve trillions of possibilities. How did Google make a program, Deep Go, to beat the world's best Go player. This was thought to be impossible.And yet Google did it.For any game, a computer program first builds a tree of possibilities. Much like a human would.A human thinks: ""If I make this move in checkers, my opponent might respond with A, B, or C and then I can do D, E, or F and then my opponent can do G, H, I if I do D or it can do J, K, L if I do E and I'm never going to do F.A computer doesn't select as well as a human so it builds the FULL tree. Meaning, what are ALL of the possible moves it can do, what are ALL of the possible responses of my opponent, etc.And then it uses a programmed evaluation function to look at the leaves of the tree it built.Whichever move results in the best leaf of the tree (as determined by the evaluation function) that is the move it makes.That's how computer chess worked for decades. I'll get to the secret sauce in a second for how computers conquered chess.And then after that I'll describe how computers miraculously conquered Go.It's only a miracle until science can explain it. It's only ""intelligence"" until it can be coded by a programmer.D) HARDWAREEverybody thought for decades (including many Nobel Prize winners) that the best computer chess programs would be developed when scientists encoded the knowledge of the best chess players in the world into the evaluation function.How does the world champion value a position instead of a weak player?This turned out to be wrong.The MORE code in the evaluation function (i.e. the ""smarter"" the evaluation function was from a human perspective) the SLOWER the program.Which meant a smaller tree would be built, which meant less possibilities would be analyzed.What really allowed the programmers at IBM to build ""Deep Blue"" which beat Garry Kasparov in 1997 were two things.Both related to hardware.a. Computers got faster.And finally, they made the evaluation function STUPID in order to use less code so the hardware could value more positions.Then, before anyone caught on to their ""artificial intelligence"" they retired Deep Blue right after it beat the World Champion of chess.As hardware gets faster, artificial intelligence gets ""smarter"".[as an aside, I once gave a date a chip that was the initial chip for “Chip Test” - the “ancestor” of what became the best chess computer, Deep Blue. She was weirded out.]----INTERLUDEWhat I just described is all the basics. You can stop now.The rest of artificial intelligence is simply combining the basics to make more advanced techniques.-----E) STATISTICS + TREERemember the TREE from computer gaming. And STATISTICS from speech recognition.Now let's go to the impossible game of Go. Google developed the program ""AlphaGo"" to win at Go when everyone else thought it would take another 20 to 50 years.First, remember Kai-Fu Lee who worked on speech recognition. And later developed Apple's first attempts at speech recognition in the 90s?At one point in his grad student days, he was getting tired of navy battleship commands (as one does) and decided to focus on building a program to play Othello.He ended up building the world champion of Othello.He took a lot of games, let's say a million, and put them in a database. And each position from each game, he would label, ""winning"" (if it was a position on the winning side) or ""losing"" in a massive database.He would identify several attributes of each position (how many white pieces, versus black pieces, how many corners were controlled, how many pieces were on the sides, etc).Now, if the computer was playing a brand new game, it would determine all the attributes of that position, then use Hidden Markov Analysis (remember: speech recognition) to match that position to the database.If the position pattern-matched a ""winning position"" then it would make the move that would lead to that winning position. If it matched a ""losing position"" it would not make that move.That program became the world champion of Othello.AlphaGo took it one step further.It put in the positions of millions of Go positions and did the same sort of breakdown.It used faster hardware to speed up the process.Then, once it became pretty good at GO, it played BILLIONS of games against ITSELF to put many BILLIONS of new positions into the database. In other words, it ""learned"".Now it was ready to play Go. It crushed the world champion------That's basically it. That's all of artificial intelligence.Let's say a bank wanted to fire all of the employees in charge of lending. And replace them by artificial intelligence.How would the bank lend money?Well, there's 100s of millions of loans already out there. And for each person who has ever borrowed money I know:- their ageI can put all these vectors in a database and divide them into people ""most likely to pay back the loan"" and people ""most likely to default"".Then, just like speech recognition or the Othello program above, I can use statistics to determine who I should loan money to.And if I say ""no"", I don't have to explain. On to the next one!---Let's say I want to fight terrorists.I already have examples of many terrorists who trained in the US and then went on to perform or attempt acts of terror.I know everything about their bank accounts. How often they transferred money. How often they traveled. How often they took out cash versus using a debit card.And so on.I can build a vector of attributes of what a terrorist bank account looks like. Then I can match new people against that database of vectors of terrorists.Believe me, every time you do a bank transfer, some AI program is out there trying to determine if you are a terrorist.----This is all that AI is.It is nothing more. It's not ""intelligent"" from a human sense. It's not conscious, nor will it ever be.Here's how AI has improved in the past forty years (and how it will improve the next 40):- statistics has gotten betterWhat is changing the fastest is data. The land grab of modern society is not land, or gold, or oil.It's data.I have been invested in many companies that collect and sell data. I was an early investor (and on the board of)Believe me when I say, data-driven companies know how many strawberries you ate last summer.And right now that data is used mostly to target you for ads about sneakers. Or politics.But this is AI 1.0. Soon that data will be used to target your every movement, your every want, your every need.Amazon Prime won't be about delivering you what you want tomorrow. Amazon Prime Plus will be about delivering you what you want yesterday.Police 2.0 will be like the movie ""Minority Report"".Even art and music will be driven by AI that studies the neurochemical responses to music you like to music you don't like. And then compose accordingly.Where will humans still be unique?I don't know. Ask the humans with AI implants that enhance their brains so when they look at you they know exactly what answers will make you happy.BUT… will AI replace jobs?The answer (at least in the next decade or so…) is NO.Look at recent examples:A) Many people were worried ATM machines would replace bank tellers.Instead, the banks made so much in profits they opened up more branches than ever, creating new jobs.B) Will autonomous delivery services cost jobs.Right now there are millions of truck drivers involved in delivering goods. With autonomous delivery, less people will go shopping, more people will be required to shop in the aisles, finding products for people.Obviously this is not a high-end job. But this replaces the fact that less cashiers and drivers will be needed.Meanwhile, there will be more high-end jobs. More maintenance engineers for the cars, customer service, marketing, etc.C) Ecommerce. Branding will become less important (branding is VERY important when everyone is shopping at the big box store but advertising will have to become more clever and digital) so the millions in profits that are generated from AI will filter down to more people starting e-commerce ventures and the ancillary businesses associated with that.)Final conclusion:This is probably a net NEGATIVE for society as the higher classes will be able to afford “super AI” capabilities, making them demi-gods to lower-classes.Instead, massive profits will be generated, which will be soaked into the economy through a rising stock market, increase in opportunities, etc.","20,170 followers",Sriraman Madhavan,4.1K,186,7.9M,2018,https://www.quora.com/If-artificial-intelligence-other-emerging-technologies-take-all-the-jobs-what-would-be-your-purpose

Books I read yesterday changed my life today.These are the 40 books that changed my life.But I have to go back to age 15, when I was pimply and scared and shy and afraid and beginning to learn the mythology of failure.The book that saved me was “Illusions: Adventures of a Reluctant Messiah” by Richard Bach, who was also the author of the classic “Jonathan Livingston Seagull”.I reread this book quite a bit. Maybe once a year.Here’s what I learned:Don’t take yourself too seriously. Don’t take other people too seriously. Don’t take the sun, and the moon, and the stars so seriously.Life is about freedom. Seriousness chains you. Be light. Be caring. Be good. Then there are less things to be serious about.What happens when you are free from the illusion?Magic happens. Coincidences happen. More things are funny. And laughter extends life.When you are not so serious, you realize there are more people worth of love.Meaning is joy. Meaning is “sleep soundly at night”.How stupid we are: insignificant brats that came 15 billion years late to the party and think we know something.Hence, “Illusions” - respect for the mystery of it all. Be bewildered. Be confused. Be a wanderer. Explore.We’re all reluctant messiahs.I was 15, scarred from cysts, parents that ignored me, bullies that beat on me so much I wouldn’t go to the cafeteria or bathroom during school hours, I’d cut school to wander around in crime-stricken bankrupt New York City. It was safer than being at school.But it was an illusion. And I was free. I hope I always keep that feeling of freedom that was gifted to me by that one book I read when I was 15.Related Post:",UNKNOWN,Shreyas Patel ( श्रेयस पटेल ),7.6K,174,1.8M,2017,https://www.quora.com/If-artificial-intelligence-other-emerging-technologies-take-all-the-jobs-what-would-be-your-purpose

Books, that if read widely, would change a billion lives.I like reading books where I feel my brain have an IQ orgasm. Like, I literally feel my IQ go up while reading the book.Before I give my list, I want to mention there are three kinds of non-fiction books:- BUSINESS CARD BOOKS: These are books like ""How to be a leader"". They establish the author as an expert. The author then uses this book to get speaking gigs or coaching or consulting gigs.These books usually suck. Don't read one. But nothing wrong with writing one.- BOOKS THAT SHOULD BE CHAPTERS:A publisher will see an article somewhere like, ""12 ways to become smarter"" and say, ""that should be a book"".Then the write mistakenly says, ""ok"" and he has to undergo the agony of changing something that was a perfectly good 2000 word article into a 60,000 word book.Those books suck. Don't read one. And DEFINITELY don't write one. Unless you want to waste a year of your life. I wasted 2004-2009 doing that.- BRAINGASM BOOKSHere's my top 10 list of braingasm books. Books that will raise your IQ between the time you start and the time you end.By the way, there are more than 10 of these books. This is just my TOP 10. Although not really in that order. It's hard for a small mind like mine to order these.""Mastery"" by Robert GreeneThis book is like a curated version of 1000 biographies all under the guise, ""how to become a master at what you love"".""Bold"" by Peter Diamondis and Steven Kotler""Outliers"" by Malcolm GladwellGladwell is not the first person to come up with the 10,000 hour rule. Nor is he the first person to document what it takes to become the best in the world at something.But his stories are so great as he explains these deep concepts.How did the Beatles become the best? Why are professional hockey players born in January, February and March?And so on.""Where Good Ideas Come From"" by Steven JohnsonAlso add to this: ""How We Got to Now"" by Steven Johnson.Basically: don't believe the myth of the lonely genius.Ideas come from a confluence of history, ""the adjacent possible"" specific geographic locations, etc.The connections Johnson makes are brilliant. For instance, The Gutenberg Press (which, in itself, was invented because of improvements in sewing looms), made everyone realize they had bad vision.So the science of lenses was created. So microscopes were eventually created. So germs were eventually discovered. So modern medical science was discovered.And so on. Johnson is a thinker and a linker and tells a good story.""Man's Search for Meaning"" by Victor FranklI'm at a loss for words here. Just read it. Don't read it for the holocaust. Or psychological theory. Read it because when you're about halfway through you will realize your life is no longer the same.""Born Standing Up"" by Steve MartinAnd while you are at it, throw in ""Bounce"" by Mathew Syed, who was the UK Ping Pong champion when he was younger.I love any book where someone took their passion, documented it, and shared it with us. That's when you can see the subleties, the hard work, the luck, the talent, the skill, all come together to form a champion.Heck, throw in, ""An Astronaut's Guide to Earth"" by Commander Chris Hadfield.""Zero to One"" by Peter ThielThere's a lot of business books out there. 99% of them are BS. Read this one.So many concepts really changed my attitude about not only business but capitalism. Thiel, the founder of PayPal, and first investor in Facebook, is brilliant in how he simply shares his theories on building a billion dollar business.""Quiet"" by Susan CainProbably half the world is introverts. Maybe more. It's not an easy life to live. You feel as if you can't move, you can't talk, you can't go into a room and spread a vision you might have.Quiet shows the reader how to unlock the secret powers that probably half the world needs to unlock.""Antifragile"" by Nassim TalebAnd throw in ""The Black Swan"" and ""Fooled by Randomness"".""Fragile"" means if you hit something might break.""Resilient"" means if you hit something, it will stay the same.But Nassim discusses ""Antifragility"" - building a system, even one that works for you on a personal level, where you if you harm it in some way it becomes stronger.He discusses Antifragility throughout history, up to our current economic situation, and even in our personal situations.""Mindset"" by Carol DweckAgain, I am fascinated by the field of mastery. Not self-improvement (eat well, sleep well, etc) but on how can you continue a path of improvement so that you can really enjoy the subtleties at a very deep level of whatever it is you love.Carol Dweck, through massive research and storytelling, shows the reader how to continue on the path of improvement and why so many people fall off that path.These are not books I'm picking so I can look smart.

These civil societies in turn depend on an infrastructure that operates at a certain energy efficiency. The infrastructure becomes unsustainable if energy costs rise beyond a point.There are going to be 9 billion people on the planet in another few decades, with a huge chunk of them old, retired, sick and economically unproductive.This population has to be fed, watered, kept somewhat healthy, secure and supplied with at least the standard of living they enjoy (or suffer) now.We need an infrastructure to deliver all thisThe only way we know to deliver this today is through our current landscape of industrial era institutions and trade. And this infrastructure landscape is very very energy hungry.So even to maintainThe good and bad news is that this attempt to keep up is going to fail. Drastically fewer working age people supporting way more elderly around the world, in an environment of declining resources and rapidly slowing productivity gains, at a scale 50% larger than today? Doesn't sound do-able to me.And doing it with enough economic surplus left over to support today's innovation models? Fuggedaboutit. LHC? Mars shots? No money, sorry. In a way those are the wrong kinds of innovation goals to think about anyway. You only need specialized, delicate tools at the diminishing marginal returns edge of an incumbent innovation paradigm. But even the right kinds of innovation that don't require that kind of infrastructure will become very very hard. People like Newton were of the upper classes living off serf-labor economic surplus to a large extent. Greek philosophers did what they did because there were slaves around to do the rest. So even that kind of capability is under threat.Which means all we can do is delay the collapse as long as possible and hope that a better economic model (with a better innovation model included, and one that runs a far more energy-efficient infrastructure supplying at least as good a standard of living) will have booted up and gathered sufficient momentum andIt's basically a race against time. We already know some of the obvious things. Take the obvious prediction that a lot of energy-intensive travel will be replaced by digital communication that takes far less energy to do the same job. Of course it will happen eventually. But it doesn't take a genius to figure out that a change that involves killing of most business travel (and the hotel industry, and management styles involving a lot of travel...) isn't going to happen overnight. Car-based suburbia won't be replaced by zipcar/shared-bicycle neo-urban utopias by next Tuesday in the 21 megacities that exist today (10 million plus population).http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MegacityIf we can't fix megacities in time what are the chances for the next tier can be? And it isn't like people aren't trying:http://www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/us/en/smarter_cities/overview/index.htmlWhat happens to innovation in the traditional sense while all this racing against time is going on? It will start to collapse and what's left will increasingly go towards maintenance problems rather than growth problems. All the startup cheerleaders don't realize the extent to which they are basically capturing returns from government and corporate R&D from decades ago, invested through government agencies and the university system. Today, there is no money and stomach for something like ARPANET. DARPA is all about narrow ""blood money"" visions today, and more than half the federal R&D budget today goes to NIH and healthcare related R&D (which is money pumped into an unsustainable healthcare system delivering to an increasing population through bankrupt entitlement schemes). And oh yeah, the university system that supplied the talent for the innovation? Also collapsing under the pressure of keeping up with the challenges.If you think a few thousand people with Stanford-level overpriced engineering degrees and a Y-combinator style ""experience"" are enough to solve the problem of shifting to a lower-energy infrastructure at the scale of 9 billion people, and within the 30 or so years we have before collapse starts to loom large... think again. Severe impedance mismatch.Will we win this race against time? I doubt it. I suspect things will come to crisis levels by around 2050 and we'll see the start of a new Dark Age, like with Europe after the fall of the Roman Empire (the symbolic start point is the sacking of Rome in 410 AD, and the Renaissance took another 1000 years to kick off).This is not necessarily a bad thing. The Dark Ages weren't awful hellish times. They were just a time when things got messy and illegible and nobody could make much sense of what was going on. Intense innovation continued in the dark (the Renaissance would be credited for a lot of stuff that actually happened in the Dark Ages).","284,852 followers",James Altucher,786,878,91.7M,2011,https://www.quora.com/Whats-the-best-way-for-a-small-investor-to-make-a-bet-on-an-emerging-technology
