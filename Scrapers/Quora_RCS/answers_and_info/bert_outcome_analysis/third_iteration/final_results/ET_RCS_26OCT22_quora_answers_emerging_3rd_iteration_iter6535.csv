0,"Uhm…No. Not in any time soon. There are so many things in the Iron Man suit that can only work in the comics. For example, the Hand Repulsor Rays? Put too much power into those and youll have rocket powered arms heading for god knows where.The built in VR and AI systems? 15–20 years ahead of our time. Finally: having a suit of armor than can take a direct hit from a tank? And still get up with no real damage done to it?Yeah. No frickin way any time soon will anyone ever build an Iron Man suit like the one see in the movies.Sorry to to crush any dreams out there. :/",UNKNOWN,Steve R.

Even just the arc reactor, let alone repulsors, force fields, etc. would reshape the world completely. Even if only Tony Stark was genius enough to invent them once, having the certain knowledge that they are possible would result in others independently discovering them.EDIT: Now, in the Infinity War movie, it's canon that the suit uses nanotechnology. Just as the latest Black Panther movie shows a necklace that turns into a super suit, now something that Tony Stark is already wearing (a hoodie, or maybe something he was wearing underneath the hoodie) turns into a complete Iron Man suit that replaces his clothes. The future likely will feature real nanotechnology, but this is magical movie nanotechnology where mass appears from nowhere.

2,"Iron man’s basic suit consists of:An exoskeleton:This one is sorta easy to do and is already being done. Essentially a robot that goes around the body and using servos and other machines lifts heavy things. They use sensors to know what to do.

Possibly can connect to your brain.An AI system:This one is fairly easy, its like siri but more advanced and can learn. You need a knowledge database (like quora) a visual processor, a text to speech program, a speech to text program and a machine learning algorithm. When I said fairly easy, I meant not at all fairly easy.RepulsorsRepulsors actually look like Ion thrusters which is already real.Looks, incredibly cool right? And even better, ion thrusters uses a gas called Xenon which sounds even more futuristic. Anyways, the propellant (usually xenon) is pumped into a magnetic chamber and shot with an electron gun, this electron gun separates electrons and protons from the xenon and the proton gas is pushed through a negative and positive grid and when outside, shot with a neutralizing electron gun. Creating propulsion.Problem is that these are usually very heavy and large, though we might in the future find a way to make it smaller. Another problem is that it doesn't produce much thrust in a short amount of time, which we could maybe fix in the future.How the repulsor shot works? I suspect they use a red-hot piece of flint, flint being extremely volatile while red hot, it will explode when struck, the flint is placed on the ion thruster, the ion thruster then builds up a large amount of protons and gas, then when there is enough pressure, the thruster is activated, sending the hot piece of flint forwards and to explode on the target.Boomthis is theoretical of course, but it would look really cool.Flight system:At the moment, ion thruster’s wont really get you, or a hundred pound suit off the ground, maybe if you used it on a different planet, or in space but right now ion thrusters are in the development stage and is not completely optimized in terms of force.Other options include: Rocket thrust, electric ducted fans, Jet engines etc.Anything that will get you off the ground.Laser weapons system:Just get a really big laser, or a bunch of lasers with a focusing lenseInertial dampenersInertial dampeners are a mechanism that keeps inertia from crushing your internal organs or destroying everything in your body.I have a few theories on how iron man goes mach 3 and can stop almost immediately for some reason.A miniature fusion power reactor:Absolutely possible!Right now the heat given off by fusion is enough to melt whatever is around it, including you, without an appropriate heat sink. So bad idea.Even a nuclear reactor would absolutely give you radiation poisoning without a large amount of lead surrounding it or radiation shielding.This is the problem with the suit, not everything else, but the power source.If we had an infinite power generator like tony stark’s arc reactor, we would basically have free energy for everyone.It sucks right?Whatever, Im gonna try to make an iron man suit anyways hehe",24 followers,Aynesh Prathy,841,0,0,2018,https://www.quora.com/Is-it-possible-to-create-a-real-iron-man-with-the-help-of-evolving-technologies

As we see, Sugarcane, Wheat & Rice are the key food-grains produced. Let us deep dive into wheat production as an example.Like you can see, wheat production increased from 73 Mn tonnes in 2002 to 96 Mn tonnes in 2014.Have a look at the global wheat production for the same duration below in blue bars. It went up from 580 Mn tonnes in 2002 to 725 Mn tonnes in 2014. A growth of 25%.Look at the global consumption on the same chart indicated by orange bars. While the consumption was neck to neck in early years, we observe that post 2009, the consumption is almost always below the production. This implies that every country has a problem of plenty of buffers of food grains.In any case, India is not a big exporter of wheat( accounts for < 5% of global exports) which implies thatThe problem we need to solve for the farmerNow lets try to solve this issue for the farmer if we can.Feel free to mail or write to me onHonest - Unbiased - Simplified, as always.Pls also read another answer to the agrarian crisis in India.Anurag Singh's answer to The farmers in Western countries like France, Germany and the US are very rich, while our Indian farmers can't afford to feed themselves.

8,"There is no possible way that we can answer that with any true precision.For a start, there are a number of animals in the world that already do have incredible intelligence, that may very well be the same as we are, but they have not been able to compete with us purely because of their physical limits.For example the other apes have not developed such an intricate language system as we have, plus they do not have the dexterity that we do to manipulate their environment and make such precise tools.Similarly, Dolphinss, whales, and Octopus have imensely intelligent brains but they are stuck inThere is no possible way that we can answer that with any true precision.For a start, there are a number of animals in the world that already do have incredible intelligence, that may very well be the same as we are, but they have not been able to compete with us purely because of their physical limits.For example the other apes have not developed such an intricate language system as we have, plus they do not have the dexterity that we do to manipulate their environment and make such precise tools.Similarly, Dolphinss, whales, and Octopus have imensely intelligent brains but they are stuck in the water and so they have those limits.Now, intelligence is only one small part of evolution, and evolution does not care for anything and it only help keep things going… Ants and Cockroaches are not intelligent in themselves, but they are very successful and Jellyfish have no brains at all but they have been around for hundreds of millions of years, so they are VERY sucessful evolution-wise.So, if humans suddenly got removed from the planet, there is no way that we can say whether anything will develop intelligence at all, no matter how long they are given?It is every bit as possible for some creature, that does not exist right now, but in a million years, maybe in 50 or 100 million years, for something to develop from an earth worm, and that had somehow managed to branch out and completely an independantly evovle its own sub-branches of life, and that will eventually develop fingers to sift soil to feed, and then that too started to crawl on land and then its 20+ arms and legs all evolved to both walk and still have the nimbleness to modify its environment and that learned to communicate through simply touching and it can share thoughts with any of its species, and with this, they develop into vastly intelligent beings without war and they clean up the world and develop interstellar space travel and so on… There is every bit as much chance as that happening as there is of any other thing that is alive today.Intelligence just helped us, but we are using it to destroy through our greed.
