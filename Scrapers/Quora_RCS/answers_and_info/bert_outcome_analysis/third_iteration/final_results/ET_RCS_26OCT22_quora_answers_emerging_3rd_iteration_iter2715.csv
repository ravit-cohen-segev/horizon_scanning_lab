I'll list a couple below.The easiest example is the tried, and a bit trite, alien trope is the hive minded species.

After taming their world, which would take significantly less time than us because of the singular will behind it, they wouldn't have the same drive we do to advance technologically. We tend to advance technologically because it's a challenge that needs to be overcome, like “I wish I could injure/kill that guy over there before he gets close enough to hit me with his weapon”. A hive could, and would, throw drones at a problem until it's solved. The loss of drones to them is akin to cutting your fingernails, no major loss to the whole. Because of the innate ability to brute force the problems away their level of technology would be probably no higher than our stone age.Another scenario would be a blind species. They wouldn't advance in ways we understand, since we process so much information visually, but they may not even advance as far as the stone age. They wouldn't need technology, or at least technology as we understand it, to be successful in their environment. They evolved in their niche to be successful so technology may not even interest them.I think that a lot of our pop culture depictions of aliens is because we anthropomorphize everything. We expect them to be like us. More than likely though they will be vastly different from us.","284,846 followers",James Altucher,991,878,91.7M,2017,https://www.quora.com/Would-it-be-possible-for-an-alien-civilization-not-to-have-the-compulsion-like-humanity-to-constantly-advance-technologically

Fairly simple if you know your basics.The results were announced after an hour.Round 2 )This was an online coding test comprising of 2 questions based on Linked Lists and Trees. Similar to how other online coding platforms work, we had to evaluate our code against the test cases that were given ( not visible to us of course ) and we got about 1 hour to complete this.The results for this round were announced after 2-3 weeks ( just when I was losing hope that I'm not gonna hear from them :P )They apparently went through each person's code and evaluated the algorithm one used to code the problems even if they hadn't cleared all test cases.They invited the shortlisted students to the Microsoft IDC center in Bangalore for the next round of interviews the next afternoon.Round 3 )This was a face to face technical interview and went on for about 90 minutes. The interviewer was very friendly and offered snacks and water to make me feel comfortable. We discussed the projects on my resume and then he asked me questions on DBMS and Data Structures. He asked me to design the entire database for Amazon on paper and then spoke about normalization. After that, I was given a puzzle to solve. He waited patiently as I solved it and kept asking me what's running in my head. We then discussed all test scenarios in a given ""50 Floor Building with 3 Lifts"" scene. I asked him a lot of questions based on the situation he gave me to make it clearer for myself ( always do that in an interview ).Results of this round were announced immediately and had a 5 minute break before my next round.Round 4 )This was another face to face technical interview that lasted for about 80 minutes. This focused more on Object Oriented Programming Techniques. He gave me a real life scenario and I was asked to design classes for the same. He asked me to draw a rough UML diagram on a white sheet and was asked to explain the inheritance relationships. I was asked to detail out the test cases where my design could fail and suggest solutions to the same. He then spoke about managing code and data at Microsoft. I was asked to discuss Software Engineering techniques as well and why each stage in the SDLC is very important. I asked him a couple of questions about the work he does at Microsoft and we were done.Results of this round were announced in 10 minutes and I had a 10 minute break before the next round.Round 5 )This was the final round that went on for about 30 minutes. He asked me about my strengths and weaknesses, where I see myself 10 years down the line, if I would like to get into managerial positions later and other standard HR questions. After this, I asked him a lot of questions about what he does at MSIT and what my role would be if I was offered a job. Spoke to him about Windows 10 and how it's going to be different. Spoke about how fake activation keys are easily available and how a lot of people use pirated versions of Windows. It was more of a discussion and knowledge transfer for me.The results of the HR round were announced after an hour and was glad to hear that I made it through :)After the tiring day and the happy result decided to take a picture at the officeSorry for the extremely long answer. :PSorry for the extremely long answer. :P","72,245 followers",Rohan Kamath,3.8K,213,29.3M,2015,https://www.quora.com/Do-we-really-need-advanced-technologies-like-artificial-intelligence-or-augmented-reality

He came in with glowing recommendations from some pretty senior people and had the exact experience and expertise that we needed. Basically he was an almost certain hire and I was his final round.I didn’t want to grill him more on the technical aspects of the role since he had already proven himself in that space; I wanted to figure out what he would be like to work with on my team and what he would bring to the table there. My team is extremely close knit; it has been like a tight family for many years and we always have each others’ backs through thick and thin; we have worked quite hard to ensure that egos never get in the way.We started off with him telling me about his journey, his passions and ambitions, his previous experiences on teams, etc, I told him about our team culture, the dynamics we share. I asked him why he wanted to join our team when clearly the whole world was open to him based on his assessment of himself.He started to tell me how he was bored of large companies and wants to work at a small startup. He said that he only wanted this job for a year so he could add it on his resume and he would leave after that. That came across as odd, but I still decided to give him a chance since I knew the specific project we needed his expertise for would probably be done in a year so it might actually work out and give us time to change his mind.The next words that he said had me completely baffled; “I am HOT SHIT!” he said, “You will be lucky to have me. You guys know I’m the best guy for the job. The only reason I’m here is because startups need people with 5 years of experience and I have only 4.”I thanked him for his time, walked him to the door and went back to the interview panel and made it very clear that we would not be hiring this guy and that I would like to veto this decision; my manager heard me out and absolutely had my back on it 100%.
