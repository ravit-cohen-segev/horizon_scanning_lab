We need to put more energy in the machine than we get out from the fusion.The most notable fusion reactor working today (we actually built it more than 30 years ago) is the JET (Joint European Torus), and it’s in England.But things might change in the next 10–15 years. It seems to me that no other answer has mentioned that basically half of the world has been united under the ITER consortium, and is working hard at building the first fusion reactor which is really believed to be capable of sustaining fusion efficiently. It is infact called ITER, and it’s being built in Cadarache, France. It should produce the first plasma in 2025, and in theory it will be capable of outputting 10 times more energy than will be needed to ignite the plasma.I follow the Facebook page of the project,So yes, at the moment fusion reactors produce less power (basically zero). Not because of physics, but engineering.PS: It is true that so far this technology has not produced impressive results compared to fission reactors. But there’s a big but. Research into fission nuclear reactors was financed with truckloads of $$ because a fission reactor can give us plutonium, that can be used to build nuclear weapons. On the contrary, fusion reactors research has got no military applications, because you cannot weaponise the products of fusion. So the amount of cash which went into fusion was puny, and it still is (the same happened with thorium reactors: they’re no use for nuclear weapons and so they didn’t get the BIG MONEY).","3,658 followers",Brent Oster,3.6K,357,1.8M,2017,https://www.quora.com/Do-fusion-reactors-produce-less-power-than-fission-reactors
1,"Lets look at this pragmatically.A fusion reactor would fuse a deuterium atom with a tritium atom into a helium-4 nuclei and a free neutron.

Lets look at the mass of the reactants and products.Deuterium:Tritium:Helium-4:Neutron:Lets sum the mass of the reactants and the mass of the products.ΣΣThe difference in those values isSo what happened to that mass? We all know that conservation of mass is a thing, so what gives? Well mass has still been conserved, but we must look at things through the eyes of relativity. UsingNow lets look at splitting Uranium-235 (U-235) by shooting a free neutron into its nuclei; the nuclei splits and one of the outcomes that is possible which we will be exploring further with is Krypton 92 (Kr-92), Barium 141 (Ba-141), and 3 free neutrons.mmmmΣΣThe difference isSo already we can see that fusion has its advantages in energy production, but what else is advantageous about fusion reactors? The most heavily pursued type right now uses superconducting magnets to confine a hot plasma of the hydrogen isotopes allowing them to fuse together into helium. If the reaction gets out of hand and can no longer be contained the hot plasma will damage the superconducting magnets causing the inwards acting pressure to cease. The hot plasma can then diffuse, expanding and cooling rapidly; in an instant it is no longer hot enough for the hydrogen nuclei to overcome the electrostatic repulsion between them meaning they cannot fuse. In short, a runaway nuclear reaction causing a meltdown has no where near the catastrophic consequences of a fission reactor meltdown like Chernobyl.Tokamak fusion reactor. The hollowed out chamber houses the plasma and is surrounded by superconducting magnetsChernobylOne last final point worth mentioning. The radioactivity of the products. U-235 has a half life of 703.8 million years. A one kilogram block of U-235 takes 703.8 million years to decay to the point that only half a kilogram of the material remaining is U-235, with the other half kilogram having decayed into lighter elements.Decay curve of U-235; y=mass x=time in yearsSame graph but looking at just the first 100 years. Notice how there is negligible change in mass. I could have a kilogram of nuclear reactor fuel sitting next to me for my entire lifespan and receive a negligible amount of radiation.The products of this reaction are Kr-92 and Ba-141, which have half lives of 210ms and 18.27mins respectively. These further break down into other radioactive isotopes with varying decay rates. For example, Cesium-137 has a half life of about 30 years. After a hundred years a kilogram sample of the products of nuclear fission will have decayed into ridiculously small amounts (calculate it if you want, but the specifics aren't relevant for this) with me receiving an incredibly lethal dose of radiation.The threat determined by half life figures goes contrary to the usual rule of thumb as a safer value will be in one of the extremes but anywhere in the middle and the threat posed is far higher. Extremely short half life (e.g. 210ms for Kr-92) isotopes release radiation at a high rate but decay so quickly that after the material is kept safely stored for a short duration of time so little of it remains that the emission rate will have dropped to a far more acceptable level. Extremely long half lives (e.g. 700 million years for U-235) release radiation at such a slow rate at any given point its effects are negligible. If the half life is neither extremely long or short (e.g. 12 years for tritium), its going to emit radiation at a dangerous rate and continue to do so for a not so insignificant amount of time.Deuterium is a stable isotope and Tritium has a half life of 12.32 years. The products are Helium-4 which is a stable isotope and a free neutron which decays into energy (photons) in about 10 mins, at which point its products can no longer undergo further radioactive decay. In other words, fission reactors take an isotope that isn't very dangerous and produces highly dangerous waste while fusion reactors would take a highly dangerous fuel and produce relatively safe products.I’ll let you decide which is better.",2 followers,Richard Muller,1.7K,2.3K,202.4M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Do-fusion-reactors-produce-less-power-than-fission-reactors
2,"I think your question has some built-in assumptions which are likely off the mark. Fusion spending is going towards something better than fission…and I say that as a guy developing next generation reactors. There are fusion concepts with no moving parts, no radiation, no activated components, and 80–90% electrical conversion efficiency. Fission, even in the most optimistic Gen V fission-product, plasma-suspended concepts can’t get there. Fusion is a better, albeit insanely difficult, mousetrap. As someone who believes that A) I’m nowhere near good enough at math to find the solution to fusionI think your question has some built-in assumptions which are likely off the mark.

As someone who believes that A) I’m nowhere near good enough at math to find the solution to fusion and B) The perfect is the enemy of the good; I’m gonna keep working on better fission reactors, which is something I can get my head around. So with that in mind, you ask why not build thorium reactors…I am going to assume you mean thorium in a molten salt with no definable fuel structure…aka LFTR. If not, Westinghouse actually already built and (a utility) ran a thorium reactor in Pittsburgh and sold its power for years (Shippingport). However, the contention that thorium reactors are easy to develop and necessarily safer than uranium or plutonium reactors is false. LFTRs are very challenging to develop and it is very hard to make a case that they are, in fact, safer than the best current reactor technologies. Today, AP1000 plants, ESBWR, and NuScale are so safe that it becomes very difficult to numerically improve on them. Trust me…I’ve tried twice and we’ve basically broken probabilistic risk assessment (i.e., we couldn’t really get a better safety number). Nuclear plants do not need to get safer, they need to get cheaper and faster to build. Sometimes, the properties which allow your reactor to be cheap also allow it to be safe, and that’s when you win (that’s what I like to think the lead-cooled fast reactor I’m developing will do).So why are MSRs/LFTRs not just braindead exercises to develop? Why is it not a conspiracy led by big, evil organizations like Westinghouse and GE to keep us on “outdated” technology? I shall plagiarize myself.Here’s a post I wrote for a Coursera course I was TA’ing. Some of the points may be slightly debatable (or not applicable to all MSR/LFTR designs), but I hope it paints a clear picture as to the difficulty in MSRs. It can also be said that rarely is one challenge eliminated without another one coming up…so be careful what you write away with a “well I can get rid of graphite by using X” or something like that. I can say, having spoken to contemporaries at different, and well-known companies (and National Labs) beside my own (Westinghouse) that I am not alone in this thinking. Lastly, I must say that this really represents my personal thoughts on the issues and not those of my employer.I'm going to focus on the liquid fluoride thorium reactor (LFTR) because that seems to be the most popular.So first, let me cover the basic operational theory and advantages of a LFTR. The idea is that you'd have a molten salt coolant. This coolant is comprised of fluoride, lithium, and beryllium. This forms two salts, lithium fluoride and beryllium fluoride. This coolant has great properties in heat capacity, boiling point, vapor pressure, and neutronics. This makes it relatively transparent to neutrons, a great heat conductor, and it maintains a low pressure in the vessel, allowing operation at atmospheric pressure. Fluoride salts are extremely stable and therefore well suited to a high-radiation environment. Additionally, the fission products (which I'll speak to in a bit) tend not to form compounds with the beryllium, lithium, or fluoride.Interspersed with the salt is the fuel, in this case thorium and some form of seed material (uranium or plutonium). The salt/fuel mixture passes through a “core” where graphite moderator resides as well as a control device. The fissioning happens in this “core,” heating the mixture and irradiating the thorium. The thorium is bred into uranium 233 through this irradiation. The uranium 233 is an excellent fissile fuel (as opposed to the fertile thorium) and sustains continued reactions. Or course this fission releases a nasty brew of fission products. What's nice in a LFTR is that the salt is constantly filtered and these are removed. This means there is never a large amount of decay heat present in the reactor system. It also means that xenon and samarium don't build up. These are strong neutron absorbers and ultimately limit how much uranium is burned in a normal PWR (hence why we still have about 1% U235 and 0.7% Pu when we're done burning). Also, as there is low decay heat, low pressure, and the system is designed for a molten/solid mixture already--”meltdowns” don't really happen, nor does a reactor accident with a lot of energy driving fission product release. Leaks tend to be self healing too, as the salt will solidify, plugging the leak.Some other advantages include less activated metals in the core. The salt, fuel, and graphite see the majority of neutron radiation. Only a small amount of metal sees significant neutron flux. This makes decommissioning easier in some ways (more on that later). LFTRs also don't produce much in the way of long term waste. As the mixture is constantly filtered, elements don't stay in the coolant long enough to build up to long-lived transuranics. In fact, they also are particularly good at fissioning some of these long-lived elements as well, making them good burner reactors too without some of the difficulties of fast reactors. They also produce lots of useful medical and rare earth isotopes/materials. The processing pulls these out in usable, commercial amounts. Lastly, the high temperatures allow for high efficiencies in the thermodynamic cycle. This has a huge impact on plant economics.Of course, not everything is roses. There are numerous challenges/difficulties with LFTRs.A primary one is lithium 6 contamination in the salt. While pure lithium 7 is produced for reactors today (lithium hydroxide used to alkalize reactor chemistry), it is unbelievably expensive (~$1000/kg) and its manufacture carefully controlled by the government. The amount of lithium 6 allowed in an MSR's salt is astonishingly low as well, making it likely that any separation process will be expensive (not to mention the quantity which needs to be generated). Beryllium is also VERY expensive (also around $1000/kg).Another consideration for a lot of MSRs (and the LFTR in particular), is the fact that fission products and transuranics are purified out of the coolant/fuel constantly. This has lots of advantages, but also causes certain proliferation challenges which are very frequently glossed over. As was mentioned, an initial seed material is typically needed. This comes in the form of a high-enriched uranium typically. So, you're starting with an HE material (proliferation risk), producing Pu239 from the U238 present and then filtering it before it forms Pu240 (aka high grade Pu239: proliferation risk). Additionally, the filtering of the salts can also pulls out protactinium. This gives access to high grade U-233, a bomb material (used in the Davy Crocket W-54 warhead). Lastly, filtering also gives access to neptunium which is judged by U.S. Weapons designers as similar to U235 in weapons usability. It's difficulty of production has prevented its use in warheads (at least to my knowledge), but it remains a very impressive weapons material.The fact that the fuel is actually in the coolant and suspended through the entire loop poses some challenges as well. From a controllability standpoint, LFTRs are challenged by delayed neutrons. Delayed neutrons are the magic gift from God that allow reactors to have easy steady state control. Basically the majority of neutrons needed to keep the reaction critical are prompt...aka they occur directly from other fissions and, given the timescales involved, can cause very fast changes in power. However, a small percentage of neutrons are delayed, in that they come from the decay of fission products. There are 6 groups of delayed neutron emitters we look at in reactor physics. They emit neutrons with timescales in the few second to couple minute range. This means we can “creep up” on criticality. With the coolant circulation time, roughly half of these are lost, meaning the reactor has to operate closer to prompt criticality. This is a situation where enough prompt neutrons are available to drive fast power changes. This means LFTRs will be less stable during fast transients. The thermal properties of the salt and graphite likely will mean this isn't a safety risk, but an unstable reactor is still not a good thing for an operator, regulator, or commercial venture.The presence of fuel and fission products throughout the RCS also causes other challenges. The delayed neutrons lost outside of the core (mentioned previously) will introduce low-level material activation all throughout the RCS. Additionally, the incredibly complex mixture of fission products now floating around results in plating out of noble metals. This is challenging in maintenance and decommissioning space due to contamination and is also a concern for heat exchanger performance, flow path area reduction, and in the potentially deleterious impacts on mechanical components like valves, pumps, control mechanisms etc. Some of the fission products are also corrosive or damaging (like tellurium), attacking some of the high-grade metals typically used in reactors (my PhD friend cites this as another primary challenge). I'm sure the NRC and other regulating bodies will have a field day with the “What-ifs” caused by this potential.The use of graphite in the core is challenging for several reasons. One is the fact that graphite in areas of high neutron flux tends to degrade quickly over time. It swells, builds up internal stresses, and generally becomes unusable over time. It is likely that the graphite would need replaced frequently (estimates of 4 years were given in the 1960s). Graphite also tends to have increasingly favorable moderation properties for U233 as temperature increases. This leads to a positive thermal reactivity coefficient (aka, more temperature = faster reaction). This is no bueno in reactor design. Unfortunately, the designs required to avoid this make thorium breeding more challenging. So it's going to be a strong regulatory challenge to balance breeding, safety, and regulatory confidence (safety and regulatory confidence aren't always the same thing).Lastly, if you happen to screw up operationally, you could end up having frozen salts in your reactor loop. Liquifying these salts could prove rather difficult, although not impossible. This is not totally dissimilar to the Russian Alfa sub reactors which used lead bismuth coolant. They needed constant heating when the cores were not critical. Occasionally this was lost and the reactors froze solid, destroying them. I believe there are solutions which have been devised, I just worry more about the required inspections after liquefying the salt again. I'm sure it would be a long and arduous process. Lots of ""what-ifs"" again.Keep in mind that none of the above challenges are impossible to design around. What scares me more than the ability to formulate a solution is the ability to both formulate the solution and get it licensed. And while some might dismiss the proliferation risks, I think all of them are technically more feasible from a weapons creation standpoint than anything that exists in a LWR, yet we are still hounded by proliferation concerns with little basis in reality. So I think the LFTR would prove a juicy target for people of that mindset. I think China's LFTR program will likely find success. They have the right combination of unlimited funding, an open regulator, and no public interference allowed which can make things like this happen.I welcome LFTRs, FHRs, Gas Reactors, and other novel options. More the merrier is my opinion. What irks me is the attitude that some have which is that ""X"" new technology is so straight forward and simple that we should stop what we're doing, abandon it, and immediately shift our focus to the new thing. At some point you have to say, ""This is what we have right now, it's a good technology, and we're moving forward with it."" Often, the perfect is the biggest enemy of the good...especially when you're dealing with the timescales present. According to some, our window for climate change is measured in a small number of decades (BTW, I do not offer opinion on climate change...outside of my expertise). Our timetables on the U.S. grid stability is shorter still. As such, I think moving forward with today's excellent LWRs (AP1000, EPR, APWR, ABWR, ESBWR, VVER-TOI/AES2006) is a smart move. I don't see any imminent danger with moving forward with those models.","220,644 followers",Franklin Veaux,3.4K,47.3K,783.1M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Do-fusion-reactors-produce-less-power-than-fission-reactors

The problem is that it is not happening; mostly as a result of how we regulate fission nuclear in the US (and in allied Western nations).Current law and regulatory obstacles to innovation raises the cost of commercial development of new fission reactors to levels that price out of participation all but the largest nuclear industry participants. It currently costs a nuclear startup approximately US$1 billion to prepare the document package for an NRC reactor design certification action - and the full cost must be provided by the nuclear startup up front a decade before any potential sales of the new reactor can occur. The current innovation environment for fission power generation is unfriendly, to the point that no new technology nuclear reactor (other than Naval reactors and ultra-small reactors for NASA deep space missions) have been commercially introduced and physically built in four decades. The first AP-1000s Gen-III+ LWRs are now under construction in the US, but have not yet been completed (and given developments of the last year - may not be completed ever). The historical record of completed fission reactors versus reactor project started and then abandoned in the US since NRC became nuclear regulator is dismal - with more reactor projects abandoned than completed under NRC regulatory supervision.Current Obstacles to fission reactor innovation -If you want to innovate and build a fission reactor you need from NRC -1) A design certification to ensure your basic reactor design is safe – cost ~$200 million2) A COL license to allow you to construct and operate your fission reactor – cost ~ $60 million3) Once licensed, you will have to pay each year an operating fee to NRC of ~$5 million dollars whether your reactor is operating or not – whether it is producing electricity or process heat or not.4) A license to obtain fission nuclear fuel for your prototype reactor must be obtained from NRC - private sale or purchase of nuclear fuels is illegal and can result in jail time.5) A Waste Confidence Environmental Impact Statement must be prepared and submitted to NRC to describe how you plan to sequester any nuclear waste produced by your fission reactor prototype. NRC must approve your plan before you are allowed to let your reactor to go critical and produce any fission power. Your will need to pay NRC staff evaluating your Environmental Impact Statement at a rate of $265 an hour until such time as NRC staff are satisfied with all elements of your plan.6) When you decide you can no longer continue operating your prototype reactor, you will have to pay NRC during reactor decommissioning. Former reactor operators are required to pay NRC staff at a rate of $265 per hour of time they are involved in supervising the decommissioning of your reactor prototype.In contrast, the regulatory obstacles for Fusion innovation –1) No regulatory obstacles currently exit in the US preventing prototyping of fusion reactors.2) You can freely and legally build fusion reactors in your home basement or at school without interference of any kind from NRC.3) You can legally buy high purity fusion fuels (D2O – which can be electrolyzed to 99.99% pure Deuterium) on e-Bay for less than $10.4) OPEN SOURCE design guides and plans can be freely downloaded on the internet for several good fusion reactor designs. Helpful Face book and Web Forum resources exits to permit sharing of fusion technical know-how and for group solving of problems with near real-time responses to difficulties.5) There are no defined reactor decommissioning costs for fusion reactor prototypes.POV - Is it really better to design reactors on paper, leave comments and post Blog articles and protest - or is it really better to just engineer and build the innovative power generation technology of the future?Engineers design and build things.Your chance of designing and building innovative ideas are much better in the fusion realm than in the fission area as a result of current over regulation of fission nuclear.------How close are we to nuclear fusion ? | NextBigFuture.com","2,203 followers",Iain McClatchie,668,411,2.8M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Why-are-we-spending-so-much-money-on-nuclear-fusion-while-a-thorium-reactor-is-easy-to-develop-and-much-safer-then-uranium-and-plutonium-reactors

Fusion of Deuterium in sea water uses a totally non-radioactive fuel and produces only totally non-radioactive waste (Helium). The environmental consequences of operating 10,000 to 30,000 new fusion reactors is easier to manage than the environmental consequences of operating an equivalent number of new fission reactors.Richard E. Smalley, “Future Global Energy Prosperity: The Terawatt Challenge”The thing that is most responsible for holding back fusion innovation and the practical construction of fusion power plants is not really engineering issues (of which there are still some formidable ones remaining) but rather is a widely shared public belief thatFUSION IS IMPOSSIBLE(but)Practical fusion will always be 50+ years ago (not 50 years away)Mankind came into possession of a practical way of generating energy from fusion over 50 years ago with the Ivy-Mike nuclear test that produced fusion energy from pure Deuterium via DD fusion. Practical fusion will always be 50+ years ago (not 50 years away). Today, there are smaller pure fusion devices designed to make clean energy (not blast effects) from pure DD fusion of Deuterium separated from sea water. One such design is called mini-Mike, which is designed to produce a small, safe, predictable controlled energy yield of 250 GJ per shot.Note: Deuterium separated from sea water is totally non-radioactive and fusion of Deuterium produces only totally non-radioactive nuclear waste (helium).--------Clean Sustainable Power Longer than the Earth has Existed or the Sun will BurnThe complete conversion of deuterium nuclear fuel releases an energy content of 250 x 10^15 joules per metric ton of deuterium.The quantity of deuterium in the world’s oceans is estimated at 4.6 x 10^13 metric tons.Deuterium present in seawater will yield around 5 x 10^11 TW-year of energy.In the year 2017 the entire planet consumed around 17 TW-years of energy, which means that the energy content of the deuterium in seawater would be enough for 29.4 billion years of energy supply.To give all 10 billion people expected to live on the planet in 2050 the level of energy prosperity we in the developed world are used to, a continuous average use of power of 6 kilowatts per person as is typical in Europe, we would need to generate 60 terawatts as a planet—the equivalent of 900 million barrels of oil per day.The time since the earth first formed = 4.54 billion years.The time until the sun burns out = 5 billion years.The deuterium in the sea is capable of completely powering planet earth at a level of 60 Terawatts for 8.33 billion years(longer than the earth has existed or the sun will burn)Here are a few reasons why fusion should ultimately be- Only tiny amounts of fusion fuel are inside a fusion reactor at any one time. Continuous operation of a fusion power plant is maintained by continual refuelling with the fuel mixture (deuterium-tritium or deuterium-deuterium), so the fuel inventory in the plasma chamber at any time is gram quantity or less and sufficient only for about one minute of operation. The ITER tokamak will contain only grams of fusion fuel as it runs. A NIF laser fusion capsule contains only about 0.17 milligrams of Deuterium-Tritium fuel-No greenhouse gasses produced-No reactor core meltdowns and no fission product decay heat burn downs (Chernboyl, Three Mile Island, Fukushima incidents cannot happen)-No mining of fuel is required for several forms of fusion as deuterium fuel is extracted from water. For first generation deuterium-tritium fusion; lithium must be mined and then exposed to a source of neutrons to form tritium fuel.-Billions of years of fuel available on earth (versus a few thousand years for uranium based fission and a few hundreds of years for fossil fuels)-1/1000ths of the radioactive waste of fission power (typical nuclear power). Nearly all materials become activated to some degree by energetic neutron bombardment. Neutron reactions in DT fusion reactors will inevitably create radioisotopes. The principal radioactive materials present in a DT or DD fusion reactor will therefore be tritium and neutron activated structural materials surrounding the reaction volume.-Radioactive waste remains radioactive ~20 years versus hundreds of thousands. DT fusion reactors would burn and require storage of significant quantities of tritium, a moderately radioactive nuclear isotope of hydrogen. Tritium gas is hard to secure and small leaks in reactor tanks and plumbing could result in some loss of tritium to the environment. Tritium decays while emitting weak Beta radiation and under most circumstances is not highly hazardous to humans. The deuterium-deuterium (DD) fusion process, dispensing with tritium as a fuel and the requirement for Tritium storage. DD fusion does however produce Tritium as part of the DD fusion reaction, but this Tritium does not tend to accumulate but is immediately burned in place inside a DD fusion reactor.-Fuel for energy would no longer be a geopolitical issue (huge benefit for humanity)-No nuclear weapons from waste products (again, huge benefit for humanity)",0 followers,Ace Grushkin,592,763,1.1M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Do-fusion-reactors-produce-less-power-than-fission-reactors
7,"RE:Yes, it isRE:Yes, it isRE:If you actually count the bodies then you will find that fission power is already the safest source of power there is even when you include accidents like Chernobyl.It goes completely against what most believe, but out of all major energy sources, nuclear is the safestAnd the 4th generation reactors will be even safer. It will be hard for fusion to beat that. In theory Deuterium-Deuterium fusion produces no radioactive waste. However it is known that D-D fusion is significantly harder to achieve than Deuterium-Tritium fusion, so D-T fusion is what they are working on. Unfortunately D-T fusion is, shall we say, not so clean as D-D fusion, so radioactive materials will have to be controlled when using D-T fusion. Does that make D-T fusion unsafe? No, but it does add cost and complexity.","220,644 followers",Franklin Veaux,3.2K,47.3K,783.1M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Why-are-we-spending-so-much-money-on-nuclear-fusion-while-a-thorium-reactor-is-easy-to-develop-and-much-safer-then-uranium-and-plutonium-reactors
8,Nuclear fusion as a source of energy can be demonstrated in a pilot plant in the coming years . However bigger reactors for commercial scale is not feasible since the large volume of Hydrogen isotope has to be handled in a big size reactor vessel with magnetic containment . Any failure in containment will lead to plasma temp level fluid coming out and destroy everything in the expensive plant .There is also a possibility of many countries experimenting with fusion bomb since the raw material is not difficult to make .The fission reactors should have been a success story to meet world energy deNuclear fusion as a source of energy can be demonstrated in a pilot plant in the coming years .

Since natural uranium is used no enrichment is required and no one can make a bomb .This design uses multiple tubular structure for keeping the fuel bundle for reaction and hence very thick reactor vessels are not required . The short fuel bundles can be shuffled with reactor working to maximize the utilization of fuel . The loss of coolant can be managed more easily because of natural uranium and small quantum of fuel in each channel . The concept and design is superb for most of the small countries but not advertised properly by canadians .,"3,658 followers",Brent Oster,3.6K,357,1.8M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Why-are-we-spending-so-much-money-on-nuclear-fusion-while-a-thorium-reactor-is-easy-to-develop-and-much-safer-then-uranium-and-plutonium-reactors
9,"University, government, and corporate groups all over the world are racing to answer your question. The development trends and breakthroughs over the last 50 years, if extrapolated, indicate that they should be able to answer your questions in the affirmative soon. Let us hope that it is soon enough to help mitigate the coming climate change apocalypse.",UNKNOWN,Viktor T.

10,"Yes, but not in time to fight global warming. We do not know when practical, economically viable power will be available.We need more options to fight global warming as soon as possibleNext generation nuclear FISSION is likely to be viable alternative form of power in the near future. Generation 4 fission can provide power until better energy technology is available.Next generation fission power can provide energy until solar and wind power can be fully developed.Yes, but not in time to fight global warming.
