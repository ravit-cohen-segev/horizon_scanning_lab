The earth will cease to be habitable in one year unless scientists put an atomic bomb on the core to start it spinning again.I swear I am not making this up.Why did the core stop spinning? Because evil government scientists were testing an earthquake machine to use as a weapon, only instead of making earthquakes it somehow stopped the core.This stopped the earth’s magnetic field, which caused birds to drop from the sky, created a lightning bolt that blew up the Roman Coliseum—no, really—and caused a beam of microwave radiation from outer space to melt the Golden Gate Bridge.Somehow, all the cars that are on the bridge at the time don’t melt. But no matter. Still with me so far? Good. What’s the solution?The good scientists must use a burrowing machine to take an atom bomb down to the core.So they put an astronaut with the Professor and the Skipper into a lava submarine—yes, again I’m being serious—and dig down with their atomic bomb to blow up the core and, in the words of one character, ““hack the planet.” (Did I mention the dialogue makes",UNKNOWN,Robert Frost,541,9.4K,195.6M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-top-10-science-fiction-movies-depicted-the-most-convincing-futuristic-technology

6,"It’s the 24th century, and a new form of transportation has been invented, and after initial testing, is now widely available to the public, including young families.This new technology is called “Jaunting,” and is a form of instantaneous transportation that allows people to teleport anywhere in the Solar System. With this revolutionary technology, humans have successfully colonized the entire Solar System, allowing them to travel from Earth to Mars, to back again with relative ease.

With this revolutionary technology, humans have successfully colonized the entire Solar System, allowing them to travel from Earth to Mars, to back again with relative ease. What once would have taken years to travel to, can now be achieved in a matter of seconds.Sounds easy-peasy right?Well there is a catch, of course!YouIf you are conscious while Jaunting, you will go insane, your consciousness doomed to an eternity of oblivion.Imagine being left to only your thoughts, in an endless field of white, for what would feel like billions of years, your sanity slowly disintegrating and mind starting to auto-cannibalize itself.“How long in there, in terms of years? 0.000000000067 seconds for the body to Jaunt, but how long for the unparticulated consciousness? A hundred years? A thousand? A million? A billion? How long alone with your thoughts in an endless field of white? And then, when a billion eternities have passed, the crashing return of light and form and body. Who wouldn't go insane?”For this reason, every person who goes under the Jaunt must be asleep and unconscious. The solution to this is to put everyone under general anesthesia before take-off.But what happens to the poor unfortunate souls who don’t go to sleep? Here is what happened to little Ricky, who held his breath while the attendants administered the anesthesia.The thing that had been his son bounced and writhed on its Jaunt couch, a twelve-year old boy with a snow-white fall of hair and eyes which were incredibly ancient, the corneas gone a sickly yellow. Here was a creature older than time masquerading as a boy; and yet it bounced and writhed with a kind of horrid, obscene glee, and at its choked, lunatic cackles the Jaunt attendants drew back in terror. Some of them fled, although they had been trained to cope with just such an unthinkable eventuality. The old-young legs twitched and quivered. Claw hands beat and twisted and danced on the air; abruptly they descended and the thing that had been his son began to claw at its face. ""Longer than you think, Dad!"" it cackled. ""Longer than you think! Held my breath when they gave me the gas! Wanted to see! I saw! I saw! Longer than you think!"" Cackling and screeching, the thing on the Jaunt couch suddenly clawed its own eyes out. Blood gouted. The recovery room was an aviary of screaming voices now. ""Longer than you think, Dad! I saw! I saw! Long Jaunt! Longer than you think-""It said other things before the Jaunt attendants were finally able to bear it away, rolling its couch swiftly away as it screamed and clawed at the eyes that had seen the unseeable forever and ever; it said other things, and then it began to scream, but Mark Oates didn't hear it because by then he was screaming himself.So remember kids, always go to sleep, so you don’t turn into a creep.In all seriousness, this is probably one of the creepiest technologies available because it combines my 2 biggest fears:It just seems so tempting too. It’s like the elephant game. Tell someone not to think of an elephant. Then they probably automatically think of elephants! Same theory goes with Jaunting, I am sure after being told not to be awake during Jaunting only helped to increase Ricky’s curiosity. And I can relate to that.Also, the Jaunt technology opens up all sorts of sinister possibilities. The Jaunt is purported to have been used by tinpot dictators to get rid of political dissidents, and imagine if someone with connections kicked you awake into a Jaunt portal, while closing up the other exit, leaving you screaming in limbo for eternity….Anyways, I got a flight to catch, see you on the other side of Io, loser.The Jaunt - Stephen King (large text for mobile).pdf",412 followers,Karl Richard Adams,1.4K,182,2.4M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-top-10-science-fiction-movies-depicted-the-most-convincing-futuristic-technology

It's a enormous dream that the company makes small progress on daily…but more importantly…it is light years ahead of any other coins progress…and it's doing so in a space where no other coins are interested in competing. That's very unique.I believe a well respected analysis came out of China rating EOS one of the best upcoming alt coins and expects it to take over eth without problem. I expect the price of eth so skyrocket like many coins, so I am not sure if EOS will match its peak number. EoS is at about $5 now though and I very much expect it to see a higher return in terms of percentage, though.Lastly, I want to mention Cardano and IOTA but to be fair, I don't know enough to confidently say either meet the standard of what your looking for in your questions, but based loosely on what I know I think IOTA will be a major player with huge returns…and Cardano is competing directly with EOS I believe…so both will rise..but down the line maybe only one will stand.",UNKNOWN,Md.

Founded in 2016 and managed over $70 million for institutional investors which is now open to worldwide individual investors. These funds are managed by a team of Binary Trading investment experts.ETHUSD – Daily ChartAccording to the daily chart,However, the cryptocurrency market has generally turned red, especially for larger digital cryptos, including Bitcoin, which rose to $9,600 after testing $9,700. For Ethereum, parallel trade can only take over if the $270 subsidy is maintained at all costs. Currently, RSI is holding above 70 at the moment. Unfortunately, it sends the opposite signals which can finally encourage more sellers to enter the market.Therefore, as long as the red-line of 9-day MA is above the green-line of 21-day MA, the coin may continue to do well and the price could hit the resistance levels at $315, $320, and $325 respectively. Meanwhile, should the technical indicator decide to make a quick turn back to the lower side, there may be a quick bearish drop which may likely roll the market down to the support levels of $245, $240, and $235.Against BTC, Ethereum is still trading above the upper boundary of the channel and the price is now hovering at 2928 SAT as the technical indicator RSI (14) trades within the overbought zone. For the fact that the bulls remain the dominant of the market, the pair seems to be moving above the upper boundary of the channel.ETHBTC – Daily ChartAt the upside, the resistance levels to be reached are 3150 SAT and 3200 SAT. In other words, a lower sustainable move may likely cancel the bullish pattern and this could attract new sellers coming into the market with the next focus on 2700 SAT and 2600 SAT support levels",0 followers,Francis Kingsley,1.6K,0,0,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-top-10-science-fiction-movies-depicted-the-most-convincing-futuristic-technology

16,"Web design and development are constantly evolving. The latest technologies are transforming the way we create websites. As a result, website designs are becoming more interactive, responsive, and functional. In addition, the number of devices accessing the Internet is growing rapidly. This means that website owners need to adapt their sites to accommodate the new ways consumers access information. To ensure your site remains relevant, you should look into these website development trends.Let us have a look at the top web development trends in 2022:-1. Artificial IntelligenceArtificial intelliWeb design and development are constantly evolving. The latest technologies are transforming the way we create websites. As a result, website designs are becoming more interactive, responsive, and functional. In addition, the number of devices accessing the Internet is growing rapidly. This means that website owners need to adapt their sites to accommodate the new ways consumers access information. To ensure your site remains relevant, you should look into these website development trends.Let us have a look at the top web development trends in 2022:-1. Artificial IntelligenceArtificial intelligence has been around for years, but it is only recently that its potential as a tool in web development has come to light. It allows developers to create search engines, user interfaces, and other web applications that are capable of making decisions on their own. This saves time and money because the developer doesn’t have to manually code these tasks each time they are needed.Artificial intelligence enables you to design more interactive and engaging pages by generating suggestions based on user preferences or past actions taken on your site.2. Optimized voice searchVoice search is becoming more and more important as users become more comfortable using vocal commands to interact with their devices. This trend is being driven by the increasing popularity of voice assistant technologies like Amazon's Alexa and Google's Assistant, as well as the rapid growth of mobile apps that use voice input. Optimizing your website for voice search can help you to increase traffic, engagement, conversion rates, and bottom-line revenue.3. Accelerated Mobile PagesAccelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) is a new way of designing and developing pages for mobile devices that uses the speed and power of the internet to provide a better user experience. AMP allows developers to create fast, responsive pages that work on both desktop and mobile devices. This means that your website can be easily customized to suit different viewing formats, making it easier for consumers to navigate. Additionally, AMP speeds up page loading times by compressing HTML content into smaller files which are then served from the server faster than regular HTML pages.4. Single Page ApplicationSingle Page Applications (SPA) are becoming more popular these days because they provide a more immersive user experience. This is due to the fact that SPA applications load all of their content from a single page, which speeds up loading times and reduces the amount of data that needs to be transferred. Additionally, this makes it easier for users to navigate through your website without having to switch between pages. SPAs also offer better performance compared with traditional web applications because they don't have multiple windows open at once. Instead, each window is loaded as it is needed, which saves on resources and improves overall speed.5. Motion UIMotion UI is a design trend that revolves around the use of motion graphics to create more engaging and visually appealing user interfaces. Animations, transitions, and effects are used to add a level of sophistication and fluidity to your designs. This makes it easier for users to understand what is happening on the screen and helps them interact with your website in an enjoyable way.Because Motion UI relies heavily on animation, it can be challenging to implement properly. However, using effective animations can result in a sleek, high-quality interface that looks great regardless of how much traffic your site sees.6. AI ChatbotsChatbots are known for their ability to engage with users in a natural way, and as a result, they have become the latest trend in web development. Chatbots can be used for various purposes such as customer service or lead generation. They are often designed to be interactive and entertaining, which makes them an ideal tool for engaging consumers online. Chatbot technology has been evolving rapidly over the past few years, and this is likely due to the rising popularity of messaging apps like WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger.ConclusionAs the web development industry evolves at a rapid pace, it's difficult to keep track of all the latest trends. That's why we're not going to do that! Instead, we're going to focus on some of the top web development trends that are likely to stay in play throughout the next year. From motion UI to artificial intelligence and beyond, these are the technologies that will shape the future of web development.","1,572 followers",Jowita Emberton,1.3K,0,0,2002,https://www.quora.com/What-top-10-science-fiction-movies-depicted-the-most-convincing-futuristic-technology
