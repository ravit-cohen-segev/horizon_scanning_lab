In this answer, I will mention the most important Chinese inventions that most people do not know we invented.Though guns are frequently regarded to be a western invention, they actually originated from the eastern civilization of China. During the Song Dynasty an unknown man managed to make a smaller version of the cannon and create the first firearm. Today, in every war, you will find the gun.2. PorcelainPorcelain. A glass-like material used to make dishes, vases, cups etc in China. During the Han dynasty, the first porcelain grew to become the materials for great works of art and also for cups, teapots, plates, vases, and more. In most of history, demand for Chinese porcelain had always being high. It was, and still is, one of the most profitable things the Chinese empire has every created, with thousands of wealth entering China from the ancient days for the humble porcelain. China was so famous for it’s porcelain that porcelain had a nickname called China.3. Mechanical ClockDuring Tang Dynasty, the first mechanical clock was created, which is the ancestor of the digital clock that wakes you up every morning. The first mechanical clock was operated by water in the warmer months, and liquid mercury in winter. The water turns a series of cogs and mechanisms which operates the clock, though it doesn't count as a water clock as the water does not tell the time.4. AlcoholThough the invention of alcohol is frequently attributed to Arabs, a discovery in 2013 of pottery containing traces of alcohol from 9000 years ago passed the title of the first alcohol brewers from the Arabs, to the Chinese, who discovered this 1000 years earlier than them. Today, this drink is extremely popular in the modern society, perhaps too popular.5. RocketsMany people, especially westerners, do not know that the rockets, the invention that took us to the moon and beyond, came from Song Dynasty China, one thousand years ago. Though it was used as a weapon, this invention became one of the things that the west used to assert it’s dominance over science and technology in modern times. But this invention was not western at all, it came one thousand years ago from far off China.6. ToothbrushThe toothbrush. The object that helps keep our teeth shining white and stop them from falling out. This invention originated in Ming Dynasty, it was bought to the west via the silk road and form then on has been keeping the world with shining white teeth.7. BanknoteThe banknote, the thing we use to pay for our items we buy. This originated from Tang Dynasty China, from then on, the whole world has been printing them over the centuries.There are countless inventions the Chinese made, and they all helped shape the world.",268 followers,Kate Scott,1.2K,724,29.2M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-top-ten-inventions-of-the-last-decade

Be it Home Automation, Industrial Automation, Health Monitoring, Smart Environment leading to automation of daily tasks to better monitoring of devices, saves Money and gives us better quality of life.An IoT platform is characteristically complex networking environment. It is not that easy to decide what platform would be suitable for your business as there are many factors involved in it.The major factors are listed below:Some of the platforms will help your business save money, and some will help save time. Due to disparate devices and sensors from arrange of vendors, the information remains discrete and as a result,the IoT landscape looks fragmented. Engaging different devices and applications may help businesses make the most of the data available and generate deep insights. But to handle such complexities, a business needs to have a platform that allows application development, device monitoring and data management. An IoT solution allows the business to provide sensor based services.The world is getting smarter as many more smart devices are being rolled out. Connected devices on smart platforms have the ability toun lock opportunities that have been unheard of till today. Deploying the right IoT platform can automate your business process and save a lot of time and money.","51,548 followers",Elena Ledoux,27.7K,6.4K,99.8M,2016,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-definition-of-Internet-of-Things

And while we are starting to see its incredible impact, we are still very much at the beginning of the transformation journey.

Whether it’s tIoT and Bigdata have come a long way in no time and the technological implementations of these concept too have been able to show that these are the future technologies that would bring the entire world together.The Internet of Things (IoT) has the power to change our world. And while we are starting to see its incredible impact, we are still very much at the beginning of the transformation journey. Soon every device you own – and nearly every object you can imagine – will be connected to the Internet. Whether it’s through your phone, wearable tech or everyday household objects, the Internet of Things (IoT) will connect us in ways we can’t even imagine yet.The Internet of Things represents devices, buildings, vehicles and more with sensors, software and network connectivity built into them. These things are connected to the Internet and to each other transmitting data and information to the people who use them.As you can imagine, life in ten years will look materially different from how it looks in 2017 as the pace of technology change accelerates, thanks in large part to the coming boom of the Internet of Things.According to Gartner, Inc., there were more connected devices than people in 2008 and in the next few years that number will rise past 20 billion.Self-transportationSensors, software and connectivity have changed vehicle technology with one of the most excited innovations being the self-driving car.These let the vehicle automatically drive on open roads and in traffic. Connected software inside the car sends information back to engineers, which helps programmers make upgrades that make the cars safer and more efficient.The hope for self-driving cars is to prevent accidents and traffic-related deaths, save time for commuters, relieve traffic jams and save money on fuel and lost productivity.ManufacturingConnected devices are being used in manufacturing to cut costs and increased efficiency and productivity.HealthcareWearable technology and fitness trackers have already proven to be a huge healthcare market. These smart devices allow people to take an active role in their health management.CommunicationCommunication is one of the main areas in which the Internet of things is having many positive effects. Mobile and wearable devices are able to talk to each other by sending data to other devices, thus everyday communication and syncing personal information between devices has become easier.EnergySaving energy is a goal of high importance as the population continues to increase and natural resources diminish. The concept of the Smart Grid refers to an electrical grid equipped with digital technology that allows for communication between the utility and the costumers through connected devices such as thermostats, gas meters and other appliances. This way power can be drawn at times when power is not in high demand and therefore cheaper.AgricultureThe Internet of things is having an impact on the farming industry as well. John Deere machines have sensors that collect data on air and soil temperature, wind speed, humidity, solar radiation and rainfall while smart watering systems save water by detecting leaks and watering only the most needed places in the fields. Sensors are being used to detect pests capable of destroying crops, which reduces the frequency and use of pesticides.Smart HomesOne of the most common ways the Internet of things is changing our lives is in our homes. Thermostats, alarm systems, smoke detectors, refrigerator, lighting and entertainment systems and even the doorbell can be connected, controlled and monitored from a mobile device.LogisticsEliminating waste and pollutants is a benefit of the union of logistics and the Internet of things. Video sensor-embedded stoplights adjust their green and red lights according to the time of day and the positions of cars. This reduces congestion, smog and idling vehicles, which accounts for around 17 percent of fuel consumption in urban areas.While these connected technologies take aWith the entire world connected, rises the concern for need for bigger data storage and also the protocols to be able to manage the large amount of data because we are talking about laying the entire world into data sets.In simple terms,If i were to put this in a simpler way:“IoT is the senses, Big Data is the fuel, and artificial Intelligence is the brain to realize the future of a smart connected world.”The end goal is to harness the data coming from sensors(or devices connected to internet) and other contextual information to discover patterns and correlations in real-time to positively impact the usage of the available information provided by IoT. Existing Big Data technologies need to be augmented to effectively store, manage and extract value from continuous streams of incoming data from the internet.Though Big Data tools promise security over large data sets, its not able to keep up with the required standard yet. With respect to the amount of data that goes over the internet through millions of computers/and other devices connected together globally, the security concerns have been major. In the coming years we can definitely expect to be able to narrow the pipeline for error and expect IoT alongwith Big Data to have more prominence in our life and make it easier to connect with each other and remove boundaries that have existed for centuries. The Internet of things continues to rapidly evolve and our everyday lives are along for the ride.","83,132 followers",Anna Sharudenko,9.9K,199,26.9M,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-top-ten-inventions-of-the-last-decade

Came back after 45 mins. I took a shower and got dressed.I sat down in a corner of my house, closed my eyes, and started focusing on my breaths. I sat there in complete silence and tried to observe my thoughts.I saw the utter chaos my mind was experiencing. I was worried about every small thing in the world. I felt like I was in the middle of a battleground.I tried to trace back the origin of every thought and find out why I was thinking this way.When I opened my eyes, I was it was only 5 mins but it felt like an hour.I felt good. I had taken the first step.It’s been 7 days now, and I want to say that meditation didn’t solve any of my problems. In fact, it has no relation to the things I was going through.But, it is helping stay calm in tense situations and think from multiple perspectives. I am having better sleep and I am able to focus my energy on things that matter the most.The morning ritual is helping me a lot.When I wake up at 5 am and go for a run, and I see almost no one the roads, I feel I am ahead. When I come back, take shower, meditate and have a mega breakfast, I feel I have conquered the world. I feel I am pumped up to take every challenge that comes on my way during the day and determined to complete whatever I decide to do.By the time I leave for work, I feel I have done which I was struggling to do all my life.

Sleep 8 Hours a NightNo ‘ifs’, ‘and’s’, or ‘buts’, you must get 8 hours of HIGH quality sleep everynight if you want to have the best life possible.Sure, you might sacrifice a few hours of productivity, however, if you look at any credible study, the research clearly shows that (unless you have a rare DEC2 genetic mutation) you need 5 sleep cycles to perform at your best.Sleep cycles occur every 90 minutes and, since it takes the average person 20 minutes to fall asleep, going to bed 8 hours before you need to be awake is ideal for optimal performance.5 Sleep Cycles x 90 Minutes = 7.5 Hours + 20 Minutes to Fall Asleep = 7 Hours 50 Minutes + 10 Minute buffer = 8 hours2. Make Sure You Sleep WELLJust because you are sleeping 8 hours doesn’t mean that you are getting 8 hours of quality sleep.To ensure that you are maximizing your “Z’s” I suggest that you:3. Exercise DailyThis might seem a little cliche, but it’s the single most important habit to ensure a high quality of life.If I don’t exercise daily (typically by lifting weights, doing yoga, or riding my bike), I can tell.I’m tired, ornery, and generally a bastard to be around.You need to get exercise as frequently as possible.Your body evolved to move so MOVE baby MOVE!4. MeditateAgain, this is cliche but it works.Taking 10 minutes every morning to sit in silence and simply reconnect with my breath and body has done miracles for my quality of life.Meditation has been scientifically shown to reduce stress, promote empathy, spark creativity, and improve overall well being tremendously.5. LaughThis is a big one that people often forget about.Laughter truly is the best medicine and starting out your mornings with a short stand-up comedy or a few clips from a funny talk show can put you into a positive mood that will permeate the rest of your day.I recommend that you find 2–3 comedians that you really love and purchase all of their stand-ups.Then, when you are cooking breakfast, play the show in the background and let the laughter roll.Oh, speaking of breakfast6. Eat BreakfastSeriously, I know a lot of you are probably avid practitioners of Intermittent Fasting, and that’s great, but unless you are counting calories and know for a fact that you are still getting enough fuel despite your fasting, you need to eat breakfast.It will charge you up for the rest of the day and prevent early afternoon “Hangriness”.7. Get Out in Nature (Preferably Near a Large Body of Water)Getting out in nature has been shown time and time again to be a HUGE factor in a person’s overall happiness and well being.We’ve evolved over the past 6,000 years to be surrounded by nature, not concrete.Make it a priority to get out in nature for at least 30 minutes a day.You won’t regret it.8. Connect with Someone You Love Every DayThis is a simple habit that will instantly and dramatically improve your quality of life.Humans are inherently social creatures and, despite the massive technological advancements we’ve recently experienced, we are more disconnected and solitary than ever before.Everyday I challenge you to connect with someone you love.Whether you Skype your mom, sit down for coffee with your girlfriend, or go hang out with amigos at the bar, spend at least 10 hours a week really connecting with people that you care about.9. Express GratitudeEvery single day ask yourself the question, “What do I have to be grateful for?”If you answer that question each morning when you wake up and each night before you go to sleep, I promise your life will change forever.10. RelaxDo something fun everyday.Play guitar, play video games, read a good book, walk by the beach.Just do something that will make you happy and help you relax.Your mind, body, and spirit will thank you for it.Stay Grounded,Learn more about my work and mission by visiting my Quora profile","66,036 followers",Niklas Göke,22.5K,235,32.3M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-top-ten-inventions-of-the-last-decade

On the other hand a common man does not have these problems he would barely be noticed by anyone. We all like to go to different restaurants and try different dishes. But a celebrity can't do this mainly because of privacy issues, security reasons etc. They can't eat roadside foods even if they wish to have cause they would be surrounded by people taking pictures of them and it will become a big news which is annoying.They would be noticed everywhere they go. They can't go to a bar, a beach, a supermarket, a theatre etc. Every part of their lives would be known by the public which is very disturbing. They can't go on a road trip and enjoy like a common man because people like us surround them. In other words a common man's life is ruled by him or lived according to him, but a celebrity is sometimes controlled by the public.But this doesn't mean that all of this is impossible for a celebrity but the problem is lack of privacy, security reasons etc. Another thing is social media attacks. They face many attacks like provoking comments or rumours about them but a normal man can stay peacefully and doesn't have to worry about all these things. We have seen many celebrity suicides. Some celebrities have accepted that they have been in depression by the celebrity life. Some celebrities said that they hated the celebrity life and wished they got back the normal life. Justin Bieber once said that he becomes depressed while being in the hotel room because he can't go out and take a walk because he will be surrounded by paparazzis. Everywhere they go they will be surrounded by people asking for pictures, autographs etc. Justin Bieber said that he won't be taking pictures with people anymore and if u see him somewhere don't come asking for a picture. He says people treat him like a Zoo animal and he don't owe everybody a picture. Daniel Craig once said that he wanted to shout at people taking pictures of him having food at a restaurant but he can't do it. But celebrity life has many advantages too. Most of the celebrities are very rich and they can enjoy all the luxuries of life. The money earned by a common man in his lifetime can be earned by a celebrity at a young age. They get special privileges and they are respected by people wherever they go which a normal person doesn't get. They are role models to many people even a sentence they say can inspire many people. And when they die they would be remembered by everyone but it's opposite in the case of a common man.On conclusion, its the way you see things. This was my opinion but if you wish to have a celebrity life then go for it. Both the sides have advantages and disadvantages. Try to be happy in life as life is too short even if you are a normal person or a celebrity. And we all should understand the fact that we don't take anything with us when we die. So try to live life to the fullest and enjoy every moment of it even if you are a celebrity or a normal person.","246,872 followers",Dushka Zapata,2.4K,8.5K,232.6M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-top-ten-inventions-of-the-last-decade

It’s in what you are receptive to. It’s in the moment being just right. It’s in what you need to see or hear.Learning is not in the lesson. It’s in you.Related:Dushka Zapata's answer to Is Quora all a bunch of people asking each other questions?","23,504 followers",Chris Freyler,3K,794,66.8M,2017,https://www.quora.com/How-can-IOT-and-BigData-help-in-improving-life-of-a-common-Indian-man

Slowly, the answers written by top Quorans started to fascinate me.Specially, the English language part.I so wished to write like them. I began writing in April 2017, but most of my answers got collapsed. My poor language skills and lack of knowledge somehow hindered my writing. Disappointed, I continued the journey as a mere reader.However, things changed rapidly in October ’17, and I was hit by severe depression after going through a series of traumatic experiences which, for obvious reasons, I can't talk much about.Note that I'm using the word ‘depression’ here with utmost responsibility.I gained considerable weight. I stopped going out, meeting friends, and spent sleepless nights. At times, I would go without eating for days.Never in my life had I felt that miserable before.The worst part was that I was away from my family. Having lost interest in everything, and with no one to share my feelings with, I felt helpless. I was stuck in a vicious circle.Unable to take it anymore, I reached out for help. My best friend, while suggesting different things, also encouraged me to have a go at writing. I was initially reticent but finally conceded.Until November, I had answered 5–6 questions.Since November, I began writing regularly.To my amazement, I started getting hooked on writing.Quora kept me engaged and, most importantly, happy. The kind and encouraging words of fellow Quorans really made a world of difference in my attitude towards life.I thank them all.Within days, I recovered beyond my imagination.I would not say Quora changed my life.It rather restored my ‛life’.I have become the person I was before- Happy.And I'm grateful to this platform for that.:-)",448 followers,Joey Carmello,20.9K,0,0,2020,https://www.quora.com/How-can-IOT-and-BigData-help-in-improving-life-of-a-common-Indian-man

It is a system of interconnected devices that shares the real time information among themselves in a network. When devices like home apppliaces, vehicles, weather forecast systems, navigations systems are interconnected over a network, they together make Internet of Things.Let us take an example to understand the beauty of IoT:You have a meeting at 10:00 am. You got an email that the meeting is delayed due to some reason. The smart alarm system connected to email system automatically delays the alarm according to stipulated time. Your coffee machine is also synched with your alarm system. As soon as your alarm hits, your coffee machines automatically brews coffee for you. You are ready to go and rain starts pouring outside. As a result, there is a huge traffic jam. IoT system automatically finds the best posible way of reaching your destination. Books ticket for you and you are ready to go. This is just an introduction of what IoT can achieve. IoT is a vast concept that can totally revolutionize the way things are done.IoT will also help in building smart cities by improving the transportation, electricity supply, water distribution etc. It does so by finding all possible solutions to the problems and choosing the best solution. In the upcoming future, people will witness smart cities that are free from pollution, smarter transport and smarter energy management.IoT has a wide scope. In the new era of connectivity, it is going beyond laptops and smartphones. It is theBut with great power comes great responsibilities too. IoT if used for good can change the whole scenario. But misuse of the technology can be devastating. So, it is important that IoT system must be secure enough that can prevent data theft and any potential threat to our system. Let us discuss about what are the various security risks and vulnerabilities involved in IoT and how we can prevent them.Internet of Thing is used to define the network that consists of a number of electronic devices interconnected with smart technology. Smart Cities, smart cars, smart home appliances are going to be the next big thing that will revolutionize the way we live, work and interact. As we know every coin has two sides. Similarly, IoT has some risks and vulnerabilities too. By overcoming these threats, we can enjoy the services of the IoT systems.","135,563 followers",Hector Quintanilla,582,1.2K,88.6M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-top-ten-inventions-of-the-last-decade
