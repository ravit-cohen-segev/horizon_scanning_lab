Despite benchmarks making it clear this wasn’t a concern, we now have desktop applications running very well on Apple Silicon. We now have low end laptops that are light weight, run very cool yet have 3x the performance and 2x the battery life of previous Intel based solutions. These changes are big enough that the industry is taking notice. These devices are the envy of the industry right now.

5,"It’s a little difficult to scale exactly, but it is indeed respected. The German way is one of systematic and verifiable efficiency.

That tank has seriously good aiming and stabilization systems.On a more serious scale, Germany has indeed risen from the ashes of WW2 and is finding it’s way after a silly rushing of the reunion of East and West. Germany was one of the leading forces behind keeping a leash on the Greek economy when it was going down the drain and actually threatening to take much of the Eurozone with it (the greeks didn’t like that very much).German engineering has produced excellent results, at par with anything the Brits and the Americans can offer, and they have standardization running so deep in their veins they set up the DIN system 50 years before Eurocodes even became a thing.Germany is, however, somewhat careful not to make too much of a name for itself. If Germany takes the lead, it still rings unpleasantly - especially to those it’s leading against. This is also one of the arguments against the 2% intention in the Nato foundings … if Germany did that, their military budgets would exceed that of Russia. That might be a wee over the top.They have their faults, same as anyone.

6,Very little of what you say is corrrect!If Germany was a supporter of human rights why are Germans assisting the Iranians to build the A bomb or the N.Koreans to build rockets because neither of these countries has either the scientific knowledge nor the industrial infra structure to make these efforts on their own.The Germans will sell to ANYBODY who will pay!

7,"“Respect” is subjective and lies inside the human mind. So you need a worldwide census to get a proper answer. Since that is, ehm, unfeasible, the second best alternative is to draw a representative sample of humans and make a survey asking them how much respect they feel for Germany. You will probably need to ask the same question regarding all the other countries on the world (about 200), since your simplistic and biased question posits “the most respected”.Alas, no such survey exists. A third best option is a more purposive sample of people evaluating a smaller number of countries. For inst“Respect” is subjective and lies inside the human mind.

A third best option is a more purposive sample of people evaluating a smaller number of countries. For instance, the Country RepTrak is done yearly by RepTrak Company, a consultancy firm. Reputation is a good proxy for respect. In fact this survey asks respondents how much they admire, trust, esteem, and have favourable feelings towards a list of countries.I am sorry to tell you that Germany is not among the top ten most reputable countries worldwide, according to the 50k people surveyed.

11,"AI might not unlock immortality. Death is inevitable and there is nothing we can do about it. However, AI might help to delay the aging process. Scientists are already trying to find a way to help people live longer and healthier. There are numerous things that AI can help with. There are many projects ongoing that work on drugs, which might delay the aging of cells. Some of those drugs might slow down the development of cancer, Parkinson’s or Alzheimer's. So basically, scientists use advanced AI algorithms to investigate aging processes and discover intervention way into it.","284,851 followers",James Altucher,992,878,91.7M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-are-Apples-core-complementary-peripheral-and-emerging-technologies-as-described-by-Paul-Trott

13,I once went in for vomiting. My doc was 60 miles away. I didn’t feel like puking in the car on the ride up. I had also been bleeding for 6 months straight but my doc didn’t think it was a big deal. Had pain in my abdomen that the doc kept saying was fibromyalgia. So when I went to the ER for vomiting they wanted a urine sample. I told them I couldn’t give them a clean one because I was bleeding so badly. That led to more questions and an ultrasound. The ER doctor came in and told me point blank I had cancer. Pre cancerous uterus and a half pound tumor on my ovary. Had I not gone in for the nonI once went in for vomiting.
