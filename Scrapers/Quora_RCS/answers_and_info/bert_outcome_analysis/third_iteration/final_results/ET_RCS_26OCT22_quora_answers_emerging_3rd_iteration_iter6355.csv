If you want an example of fast evolution, about 50 years ago researchers deliberately moved a small group of Italian wall lizards to a new island with a slightly different environment from the one they were used to. They came back and checked on them I think 36 years later, and their jaws and guts and digestions had evolved to be markedly different, and more suited to their new environment and diet.","15,557 followers",Gary Meaney,1.8K,758,23.6M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Can-some-other-species-of-animals-evolve-to-compete-or-help-in-technological-development

You know, like “how engines work,” or “transmission diagrams” and eventually stuff will start making sense.

6,"Evolution is the process by which organisms in an environment have traits that allow them to take advantage of changes in the environment. They are the ones who have most advantage over other organisms in their own species or others. The traits that give them the advantage allow those that have those traits to reproduce in larger number than those that do not have those traits. The process is known as “selection”.Technology is a change in the environment. As such, the more technology influences organisms with the traits that most benefit from it to be selected for and increase.So technology isEvolution is the process by which organisms in an environment have traits that allow them to take advantage of changes in the environment.

This is occurring across all species including humans.Example, people that better inter phase with computers and technology assisted communication will be selected for over those that do not.Birds that have traits that avoid wind turbines will be selected for over those that do not avoid them.And so on and so forth.

Technology evolves because of our understanding of natural law. In fact, building apparatus to test physical law or exploit it in novel ways is one of the main driving forces on technological development.Here are some of the forces driving technological development:It is the last three that are the biggest drivers in developing new technology.Making things smaller, cheaper and more economical are responses to market forces, as we can see from the improvement of digital technology over the last half century. This is Moore’s Law. It is achieved with continuing small, but increasingly difficult improvements, with rare applications of new science.Enabling Technology and Applying ScienceSometimes natural law tells us something is possible, and if the payoff is big enough then enormous effort will be put into making it work. One of the outstanding examples of this is Nuclear Fusion.Physics and Astrophysics tell us exactly how this works in stars like the SunScientists immediately saw that you could (in theory) use magnetic forces instead of gravity to confine the plasma on a human scaleThe ultimate aim of both lines of research is economical fusion power, with the initial aim of getting more power out of the reactor than is put in to drive the reaction.Once economic fusion is achieved, the normal processes of making smaller, cheaper and more economical can be used to drive the costs down to the point where fusion power becomes competitive with other sources of power.Testing ScienceThe most innovative new technology is driven by the need to test scientific theories, and to measure scientific constants.For me, one of the most brilliant experiments was that of Henry Cavendish to measure Newton’s Gravitational Constant, GThe innovation was to use a stiff wire that was very sensitive to torque, or twisting forces. The deflection could be measured as heavier weights were brought closer to the weights hanging from the wire.The headline describing this experiment would have been “Cavendish weighs the Earth!”The idea was not new to Cavendish, as it had been used a few years earlier by Coulomb to measure electric charge.Once Coulomb and Cavendish had demonstrated the effectiveness of the torsion balance, it became a widely used tool for precision measurement.This is just one of the many innovations made routinely by scientific instrument makers.",366 followers,Brett Alder,1.1K,0,0,2018,https://www.quora.com/Can-some-other-species-of-animals-evolve-to-compete-or-help-in-technological-development
