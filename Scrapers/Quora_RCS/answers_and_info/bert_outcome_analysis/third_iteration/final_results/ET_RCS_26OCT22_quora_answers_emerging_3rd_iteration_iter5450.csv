3,"Blockchain is an open ledger; it’s decentralized, participants can track each transaction, democracy of sorts. It brings transparency to financial transactions, plus it’s fast! It cuts the middleman. And this should give you an idea why blockchain could be useful in stock exchanges.Markets operate with brokers, investors, regulators, traders, and usually it takes like 3 days to complete a transaction.

The delay is totally avoidable since the cause in most cases is due to intermediaries, clearance and regulations. If these transactions shift to automation and decentralization it will mark a new era in the investing world.If implemented, blockchain will remove paper work, the transfer of ownership of financial securities will become extremely fast, almost instant. Plus, smart contracts will introduce built-in rules and regulations, eliminating 3rd party regulators. Simply put, transactions in violation of rules will not get registered, and this will be on autopilot.When you add it all up, transactions will become much faster. Which means, more liquidity, quicker settlements, better transparency. Blockchain is an open ledger, the source or the ‘truth’ can be accessed by all participants. And since it will involve less manual work, transaction costs will go down, a lot.All of this sounds promising but keep in mind that blockchain is new, there will be glitches in the system, some unprecedented issues that can only be rectified once they manifest. An obvious problem though will be the legal standing of blockchain tech itself; How safe is it? Can it practically combine the three elements of trading, clearance and settlement? If yes, then, how will regulators converge to a single source since currently the three elements are dealt as three separate legal matters?Don’t get me wrong, Blockchain has a lot of potential and its already going through a rigorous testing phase. Nasdaq launched a blockchain private-trading platform ‘Linq’ in 2015. The companies that are not listed on Nasdaq can digitally represent their ownership there.Another Nasdaq partnership with Swedish Bank SEB is to test mutual-fund trading platform which will run on blockchain. The principle is the same here; implementing open-ledger to record transactions much faster (in real time), plus this data will be available to all market participants. If realized as intended, this will be huge. Right now the Swedish fund market does not even have a central repository to record fund holdings. There is a ton of paperwork involved - slow and inefficient.In 2017, Nasdaq also completed proxy voting on its Estonian exchange using blockchain. Moscow stock exchange is looking to implement blockchain to offer e-voting for bond holders. London Stock Exchange is working with IBM to come up with blockchain based system to digitally issue shares of small-medium enterprises in Italy.We have to wait and see the full potential of blockchain in the stock market. My guess is once the regulation catches up with the revolution of technology the disruption that people have been talking about for some time, will finally hit the market.",26 followers,Balaji Viswanathan,13K,5.6K,427.2M,2018,https://www.quora.com/How-can-the-stock-market-survive-given-the-emergence-of-crowdfunding-and-blockchain-technology

Don’t be one of these idiots.Similarly, don’t be an idiot who complains when violating terms of service and getting kicked off on any “free” service. The stuff you get for “free” on Facebook or Google is owned by a corporation and provided to you because the corporations make money off of advertising. Their property, not yours. Don’t like it: don’t use it.The next step up is to take advantage of that understanding and doing some setup or even a little programming. Doing this takes a little more rigor and logical thought, but can net you a job or save you a ton of money.For example, Google AppSheet can be used to set up a bunch of stuff for a small business. My wife uses it to help with customer and employee tracking, payrolls, services, etc. The money she saves by doing that herself goes into her pocket instead of a consultant. There’s almost no code involved in that (although she can code and does so for other things).Then you start getting into programming. WhichIt’s not software engineering because programming is simply one tool in a toolbox. A hammer doesn’t make a cabinet builder, a wrench doesn’t make a plumber. But each widespread programming language is a useful tool for some group of people.Finally, there’s tech careers. There are lots of roles for competent people, but most people aren’t competent: they don’t have a solid understanding of how computers work, and they can’t logically put together ideas or use a programming language (see all the above points). Software engineering is all of those things and more, which is why the norm is a 4-year degree in computer science or engineering.I would advise that most people shouldFor those with high natural ability and drive, I would say go to the areas and career paths that drive you.

Writing can be one of the most vulnerable things you do.How do I become a Master?Read and learn from the best:Read: Gary Halbert, John Carlton, David Ogilvy's books, Joseph Sugarman's book, Bob Bly has a great (long) book on all the tactics of copywriting.It doesn't stop there. Keep going.Reading a book is only 5% of it. Look at ads you see in magazines, newspapers, on TV.Open your junk mail (yes all those Time Warner Cable bulk mails sent out) and read their copy.Typically, it's horrible. Alot of *flash* and *huzzah* without any substance. The reason for all this?You see what others are doing and what NOT to do (and what you should be doing).That's another 10% (notice we're only at 15%).If you don't absolutely love reading copy others do to learn from it, you're not going to enjoy this profession. Gary Halbert typically tore out ads he thought were great and kept them in a ""Swipe"" file. Every time he wrote copy, he pulled them all out for inspiration.Pick up a PenFor every new piece of copy, start with a brain dump. Look at the product or service, describe the benefits, what does a customer feel when using it, WHY should they buy it.A secret?Write down every reason a customer will say ""NO"" and then in your writing, subtly, answer those questions.This is the brain dump process. You aren't editing. All ideas are ""good"" at this point.Next...Step away. You need time for your brain to organize thoughts. Go read, go walk, go play, go have sex. Anything but thinking about what's written. It's called the Incubation period.What you'll find is you'll be taking a shower, walking, having sex, then EUREKA, an idea will hit that will connect different ideas together.You'll jump out of shower (or the bed) and go and write some more. Here you are still not editing yourself, but developing your flow.Write your HeadlineThis is the most important piece. Have you ever caught yourself flipping through a magazine and realize you've skipped most of it?Sure. Want to know the reason?Because the headlines didn't GRAB you. They didn't reach out of the page and catch your attention to tell your brain ""Hey, this is interesting.""You'll have this same issue unless you develop a grabbing headline. Here's 38 headline ideas/templates:EDITThe last step in the process is to edit down everything. Take out words. Replace words with ones that have deeper emotion.Trim the fat. Read everything out loud and hear how it sounds. Normally, you'll find the awkward phrases, the weird sounding words etc.Mastering?You become a Master when you understand how to do all this over and over and over and perfecting it over and over.Soon, your writing gets better. Ideas come faster. Your hourly rate goes soaring.Mastering is simply taking something (much like a shooting movement in basketball) and repeating it until you know how to do it very well.Enjoy it","2,985 followers",Jon Wayland,500,385,4.9M,2016,https://www.quora.com/How-can-the-stock-market-survive-given-the-emergence-of-crowdfunding-and-blockchain-technology

It was the case for me. I had a blind spot for that unknown “whatever” that I worried endlessly that could trip me up. It kinda immobolized me for a while. But at some point, I got past that. It was ok. It will be ok.I had to wipe my mind clean with a different setting. To reboot. I went somewhere entirely new, foreign, or strange to get my perspective to change. Burst the bubble I was in. I listened to different music, stopped watching TV, stopped most social sites, stopped the internet for a while, talked to people in the field I wanted to switch to. I went to a different country, up a mountaintop city filled with temples, meditated for weeks and lived with monks for a while.Through that “outside and different” journey, the hope is that one will find inspiration that goes beyond just logic to make the decision.Live full.

Back in the 1990s, VR was set to be the next big thing but the headsets were very expensive and the processing power was too slow, so the technology never took off. However, more recently crowdfunding has brought about the first version of the Oculus Rift™ headset, which has proved to be an incredible success and spawned imitators from Valve™ and Sony®.Virtual reality is creating a whole new way of engaging with games VR in its current form consists of two screens, one over each eye, with special lenses that magnify the screens so that they fill your field of vision.Added to the headsets are accelerometers, which measure which direction you are looking in, and gyroscopes, that measure how much you have turned your head. Often a positional tracker is paired with the headset, which follows your head's position in space so that you can move forwards and backwards. This positional tracker can be combined with motion controllers, and even a treadmill, to create total movement in a virtual world. 426 Computer Games Development Augmented reality and wearable technology Microsoft® have taken a different approach to the new headset phenomenon and have focused on augmented reality (AR) instead of VR. AR uses cameras to capture the real world and layers virtual game assets over the top so that they appear to exist in the real world.AR already existed on various mobile apps and in-game form on the Nintendo® 3DS™ and PlayStation Vita™ but Microsoft®'s Hololens™ seeks to outdo them all by creating engaging experiences with virtual characters in the real world. Once you have exhausted all the games on your PC, console, mobile and handheld games devices, you can look to smartwatches to top up your gaming urges.The Apple® and Android™ smartwatch app stores both have a growing range of simple games, which you can play on your wrist. These games are restricted by the size of the screen that they are played on, but sometimes a physical restriction can be the catalyst for an amazing game idea. Lifeline™ is an example of an Apple® Watch® game, where the player receives messages from an astronaut stranded on an alien moon. The game's interface is simple text but it is an engaging and exciting story with delays built-in so that players are not staring at their watches for hours on end.Whilst virtual reality places you in a different world, augmented reality brings virtual objects into our world.The Apple® Watch gives you access to apps on your wrist It is not just headsets that are changing the way we play games. Digital distribution platforms such as Steam™, GOG™ and PlayStation™ Store have changed how we buy games. One of the most dominant games providers, Steam™ by Valve™ is also one of the best places to get indie games, which can often cost a lot less than console disc-based titles. Disc-based games are often priced the same as their digital equivalents on the console's own digital stores, as there are not many incentives for console publishers to discourage their audience from buying games in a traditional shop, because if the shops cease to exist then there are fewer places to buy the console.",0 followers,Lucas Martin,6.4K,65,4.2M,2021,https://www.quora.com/How-can-the-stock-market-survive-given-the-emergence-of-crowdfunding-and-blockchain-technology
