3,"Assuming the gravitation was directional, it would allow architecture in which ramps “felt” easier to walk upward on. If it was strong enough and directional, it would allow architecture in which people walked on walls or possibly on ceilings. Buildings could be redesigned to allow a sort of M.C. Escherian living space.

Escherian living space. You would need warning signs and markings through, so pedestrians realized gravity was about to shift by 45 degree on the ramp or 90 degrees along a wall.You could also position these devices along a conveyor belt at a diagonal angle from the horizontal, so items placed on the conveyor built would be pulled toward one direction and roll or slide that way—making it very easy to move crates and cargo.Assuming you could put the gravitational generator on one side at the base a windmill, and hang another one upside down extended from a ramp on the top of the other side of the windmill, you would have one side of the windmill constantly pulled down and the other side constantly pushed up, allowing the windmill to spin without wind. Presumably, the power to make this happen would have to be equal to or exceed the power the windmill would generate, however—or else you would be violating the laws of conservation of mass and energy by creating endless motion.If the gravity generator was placed at the base of a birthing chair at the hospital, you could double the G of the baby, making childbirth easier if the woman was in a squatting position,If you had a number of these devices strung out along a metal bar or rail in space, you could use the gravitation to pull a satellite or space ship along the length of the metal bar or rail at up to 1 G. (The longer the metal bar or rail, the bigger the ship you could accelerate to 1 G). At the end of the bar or rail, the ship would stop speeding up, but because it would then be in zero-G, it would continue moving at that speed. So, it could be used as a kinetic accelerator to launch ships outward from earth—though these ships would need some other means to brake at their destination.If the device were reversible, and you could create contra-gravity that made aircraft lighter, you could hook these to aircraft and create jets twice the size we have today or jets the same size that used much less fuel,Reversible versions would also be very useful as “safety nets” to protect people falling off bridges or the sides of buildings. The less they weigh when they hit the ground, the less damage they would take. If these could be installed in cars, pulses of gravity could be used in the case of a collision to alter the direction of impact and redirect the inertia of the crash to reshape the crumpling of the vehicle or to deflect large fragments from hitting passengers, if the device were hooked up to sensors and a computer to calculate where and when to emit the pulses of gravity.Localized artificial gravity augmentation could be used as a security measure. If intruders or criminals entered a place they shouldn’t be in, the guards could double the local gravity in that building. Now, they weigh twice as much, move more slowly, and are at great risk of breaking bones and spraining ankles if they stay in the area. Good luck running from the police when you weigh 400 pounds but only have the muscle mass to move 200…. Alternatively, it would be useful for prison cells. You simply redirect gravity to flow horizontally, and that would turn a long corridor into the equivalent of a deep pit, and your prisoners would then have trouble “climbing” out—If the device is not limited to 1 G, you could simply store more and more gravitational force, then release this gravity in a burst as a weapon. Gravitic landmines and rockets could crush the area around them with 10G or 12G of force, bringing down buildings and pulping troops like jelly.A gravity generator would also be a potential means of communication. Gravity waves move at lightspeed, but they aren’t blocked by nebula, dust, or static and EM the way radio waves can be. So, if you had a simple gravitometer in one part of a planet, you could aim your gravity generator at it through the earth or through Jupiter and rapidly pulse your gravity generator to send digital messages to the other side, rather than bouncing radio waves off satellites or transmitting through cables to work your data around the planet.If the devices were small enough to be worn as a belt or backpack, they would revolutionize weight training. You could simply set your local gravity to be 0.1% higher each day to gently give yourself more and more of a workout. If you spent most of the day moving around and lifting objects with +30% weight, that would end up being a really good muscle-building regimen.If the device were small enough and aimable, you could use it as a plumber’s tool. Simply point at a clog and double the gravity to help force the waste through the pipe, or point at a clog and reverse the gravity to “suck” the clog upward. Plumbing and irrigation pipe would get very interesting, indeed, if these devices existed. These would more or less replace pumps as we know them.Canals and rivers could also be easily redirected by gravity, resulting in “tamed” rivers that flow upstream to take boats and ferries to higher ground, akin to how Kevin Anderson imagined it in some of his",UNKNOWN,Robert Frost,3.9K,9.4K,195.6M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Sci-fying-a-bit-If-a-gravity-generator-was-somehow-invented-think-about-something-able-to-provide-1g-to-astronauts-in-microgravity-what-other-consequences-and-capabilities-revolutionary-or-not-would-that-technology

These same cities will put up chargers in parking spaces. The smog and fuel smell will go away from the cities. Peoples health will improve.Tesla is a poster child of electric cars. I fear greatly that if they fail, electric cars will fail. The only reason VW, Hyundai and Jaguar just to name a few are making them is because they feel the pressure from Tesla. They know not everyone can afford one, so they make cheaper and smaller versions, and because they get tax breaks. Toyota does not make the Prius because they are trying to make a good hybrid car, just look at the Prius, it is so ugly, it isn’t even a good hybrid. You can not drive on interstate using the battery, the battery is just for 40 km. You end up using the petrol engine for most things. No. They make these cars because this allows them to pay less taxes when making gas spewing cars like Land cruiser and other huge cars.What makes Tesla absolutely stunning, they are still here. They are getting better every day. They make more cars today than yesterday. They are making more cars in a plant previously owned by Toyota and GM and they are making more cars in that plant than the previous owners ever could.It does not matter where you look at Tesla. The superchargers, their support, their charging, their batteries, the gigafactory, their roof tiles and just about everything they do is spectacular. Sure you can point to gaps between doors and such that do not match perfectly, but neither do many brand new cars today.

And the economy will start to boom (as will babies), and there's this unbelievable pent-up demand for new cars - not just re-spins of the pre-war stuff that's still hanging around. Actual NEW cars.Crickets chirping in Detroit.That's the time and environment in which Preston Tucker started to build his car.Making new cars is hard, and in those days, the cycle from ""hey, I've got an idea"" to ""here are the keys to #1"" was close to a decade.StudebakerIt was full of stuff people hadn't seen before - like the massive wrap-around rear window, and full rear seat seating for three adults - but under the hood, it was pretty much the same as the pre-war models.Tucker wasn't far behind. And he didn't want to have a ""me too"" car. He had something completely different in mind.He'd seen the future, from the tech that went into the war machine, and from designs in Germany. Aluminum. Fuel injection. Flat-six engine. Rear engine, rear-wheel drive. Disc brakes. Four wheel independent suspension (recall at the time that at most cars had the front wheels independently sprung and the rear wheels shared a common axle - that was the norm well up into the 1990s).For point of reference, the next production car that had an aluminum fuel injected flat six engine in the back with rear-wheel drive, stopped by four wheel disc brakes on four-wheel independent suspension was this little example from 1969:Perhaps you've heard of it? It only took some of the best minds in the automotive industryHe also saw how airplanes worked, and wanted a functional cockpit, with all controls within easy reach, great easy to read instruments, padded dash, seatbelts. It looked like another day in the life of a pilot, for for ""Joe Average"" it was like sitting in a space ship.And that's not counting the safety features (assuming you think that ""awesome brakes"" are a performance feature, not a safety feature). Perimeter frame with roll cage for side-impact as well as roll protection. Shatter-proof pop-out windows, all the way around. Preston Tucker held a patent for the collapsible steering column, but none of the production cars had it - we didn't start seeing those in US-produced cars until the 1970s.Also, the brake pedal locked with a key, so you could park it, set the brake, lock it - and be pretty safe in assuming your car would be right where you left it when you parked it. Near as I can tell, it was the first auto-anti-theft system designed into a car.I've had the privilege of driving a Tucker 48, and unlike most cars of the era, it pretty much feels like driving a modern car. There's none of the heaviness and ""holy crap what's it gonna do now"" that goes with driving other cars from the period. There's no ""float"", there's great driver engagement. It's solid, sticks to the road, does exactly that you expect it to do. Which is pretty amazing considering you're pushing nearly 18 feet of steel weighing over two tons.With only 51 cars built, each one is different from the next. Preston was still struggling to get it right, and kept improving things as better solutions were found, better suppliers located.If he'd been successful in navigating the political arena that he didn't realize he was playing in, and we'd had a full production run of 48s, and then onto the designed and not built 50, and whatever he had in mind after that, the American car as we know it would have been forever fundamentally altered.Safety features that took decades to be legislated into existence would have been ""me too"" items included in every car from everyone else just to keep up. Performance - not straight-line how-fast-can-you-go performance, but actual performance, cornering and braking - would have been pushed ahead by nearly 30 years.I can't even begin to think of the lives that would have been saved just by those two factors, nor what life would have been like growing up in an America where these things were the norm.",62 followers,Dave Sessions,649,0,0,2020,https://www.quora.com/Sci-fying-a-bit-If-a-gravity-generator-was-somehow-invented-think-about-something-able-to-provide-1g-to-astronauts-in-microgravity-what-other-consequences-and-capabilities-revolutionary-or-not-would-that-technology

Tesla do this not just with one core but with two, working in parallel. Strategies produced by each independent neural net are compared and, if matching, sent to the various actuators to be translated into whatever vehicle activity is demanded. Multiple levels of redundancy are built in so the system is failure tolerant to a high degree.Furthermore, all their data accumulated from billions of miles of real-world driving at real-world speeds and with human input and human decision-making is fed back into training their neural nets - and will eventually percolate down to each and every suitably-equipped Tesla on the road via OTA updates.

Britain was at war with France, Spain and the Dutch while at the same time fighting the rebellion.Anglo-French War (1778–1783) - WikipediaFred Paul's answer to Would the 13 colonies have won the Revolutionary War without the leadership of GeorgeWilliam Pitt the Younger, a Whig and colonial sympathizer, became Prime Minister in 1783. He immediately called the war off. Peace negotiations were conducted in Paris that same year. France was not in a good position. She had just lost a major naval battle with the British. The Americans felt that they would not be adequately represented with the French and therefore decided to parlay with the British directly. The Brits agreed. Independence was granted to the 13 colonies, not The United States.William Pitt the Younger - WikipediaHad the Patriots and Founding Father held off till 1783, the original demands would have been granted. Proof of this flexibility is the Quebec Act of 1774, where the French in Quebec were granted their rights to the French language, the Catholic Church, the CC to collect money and own property, and existing civil laws.Quebec Act - WikipediaPropaganda was well developed by the Patriots. Most could not read and news media was rather limited, however, the great effort that the Patriots put in place to broadcast bogus propaganda, I.E. Boston Massacre… was far superior to the British.Amazon.com: Propaganda 1776: Secrets, Leaks, and Revolutionary Communications in Early America (Oxford Studies in American Literary History) (9780190677497): Russ Castronovo: BooksIt's a pity because the country that would have been would indeed have been a great country. The War of 1812 would not exist along with the American Civil War. Slavery would have been abolished earlier. WWI would have been short-lived. No WWII. No Pearl Harbour or the Battle of Hong Kong. The BOMB would not have been dropped. 27 million Russians would not have perished. 6 million Jews not exterminated. The Louisiana purchase would still have gone ahead because revolutionary France was bankrupt. The same with Russia and Alaska. Oregon would have extended to California. Texas being Texas would have been, well… Texas. The push westward would have continued as it did for Canada.

It really wasn’t that hard, but, hey, colonialists gonna colonize.So, let’s say the British government had even the slightest amount of common sense to them and let the American colonies, by far their most populous, have some seats in parliament. The Americans stay as part of the colonies and disband slavery in 1834 with a great deal of complaining but little actual fight. Sooner or later they bust into the interior of the continent, and settle as far west as the Mississippi.I don’t know if the British would have acquired Louisiana, but with those damn jumpy Americans and their obsession with going westwards hanging about, I would expect them to go for it with or without Napoleon’s permission. Same with Florida, Texas, and the Mexican Cession, except they’re going west for King and Country, blah blah blah, all that jazz.Then 1876 rolls around, and the British North American Act is passed by Parliament, making what would be the US and Canada nominally independent Crown Dominions. With the geographic continuity that the southern part of the nation provides, the land is split with Quebec being a different Dominion than the rest of North America.Seated in New York, the government of the Dominion of North America bows to the Queen (Victoria, thisThat’s it.

24,"Actually Harry Turtledove has written a science fiction novel about this and he was not the only one.The British Empire would have continued a lot longer and America would have been one of the Dominions, along with Canada and Australia . And Europe would look markedly different.I can even cite an example: Britain tried another Dominion at the Canadian East Coast but it faltered. It was the Dominion of NewFoundland. So there were actually two Dominions in North America: Canada and NewFoundland. So there might have been three Dominions in North America. BEFORE the Revolution Benjamin Franklin acActually Harry Turtledove has written a science fiction novel about this and he was not the only one.The British Empire would have continued a lot longer and America would have been one of the Dominions, along with Canada and Australia .

So there were actually two Dominions in North America: Canada and NewFoundland. So there might have been three Dominions in North America. BEFORE the Revolution Benjamin Franklin actually made plans for a Dominion but I forgot the details. It was the “Plan for the Union”of 1754, I Think. They were to be under ONE governor-general, not a ViceRoy.And here is the map of a suggested Europe..No unification of Germany or Italy. But Austria extending into East Romania, the playground of the Russian Empire to the annoyance of the Moldavians -at Russia- seems unlikely.Linking a monarchy to an smaller America is not really realistic. Turtledove even thinks the Dominion would have annexed the Mexican South of California, Alta California. .Have you any idea how many attempts there were to secede from the United States since it was founded. All of them republican oriented.However, America would become a strictly parliamentary state. The first among the Secretaries of State as Prime Minister would wield real power, the Souvereign and his/her representative, the Viceroy only being a more or less influential figurehead.Andre MauroisAndre Maurois, a pre-war French writer wrote the center of the British Empire would simply move towards America and the souvereign being forced to reside some months in America. Not unlike Rudyard Kipling’s eh… dreams.However, you can bet there would have been attempts to enlarge the American Dominion with the British Antilles. Then America would even have become a bit larger. In the real world both the plans to include these Caribbean Islands into Canada failed just as a Confederation of these Islands into Antillia. Big plans of the 1920s through 1950s..The West Indies Federation 1958–1962, planned as AntilliaI have to counter another AnswerThe British Empire was famous/infamous among the colonial Powers by fiercely combatting the slave trade and later slavery itself.The entry of the United States into the First World War was motivated by the fact France might lose and so would not be able to pay its debts to America. And the Wilsons with their hypocritical ideas effectively destroyed Europe.The attitude of America towards the world AFTER the Second World War was motivated by two conflicting ideas: a. to stem communism, certainly after 1949 and b. to combat colonialism, another hypocrisie. The real intention was to replace European interests by American interests. Besides, the United States still owns overseas territories..Then we have a colleague who maintains there were no loyalists to speak of during the American Revolution.. Very wrong, safe estimates come at 20 % of the colonists. Pride of place took the Anglicans and Lutherans. The majority of Native Americans fought for the Crown. And of course many colonists did not care which way or the other. There existed a geographical division as well: the South was embroiled in a bitter Civil War between loyalists and patriots, the Middle States like New York, Delaware and Pennsylvania were the epicentre of loyalism, especially Pittsburgh and Philadelphia. Only New England had a clear majority of patriots but here the memory of Cromwell lingered.. Actually at some point the British proposed a smaller America, New England only. And there was a Class Division too; the Middle Classes were the mainstay of the Revolution except those who lived from trade with Britain and Europe. The Poor were divided and the Higher Classes tended towards loyalism although most of the Revolution’s leaders were Upper Class. When the British left much of the High Society left as well.The problem with the American Revolution is that it gained a semi-religious status. And anyone not supporting it is a villain. Even Washington found this too radical.Another weird thesis of this believer is that America never would have contained the West Coast. The efforts of Spain before 1600 were soon discontinued. Only in the second half of the 18th century Spain, Britain and Russia were exploring the West Coast and all three claimed it. It was simply they often lacked the means to go that far. Remember Cook’s Voyage which was a first! Spain had colonized California only in the first half of the 18th century. Around 1800 Britain took what is now Oregon and Washington State and sent a Governor there.One of the early Spanish Churches in California but it has been made more imposing under American rulePPS. I suddenly remember another science fiction book. In it Princess Charlotte of Wales survives and travels with her husband Prince Leopold to the Dominion of America. They stay there for a long time , acquire roots, and the couple gets a healthy daughter, Caroline. Charlotte returns to Britain as Queen. But because the daughter elopes with a Catholic Victoria becomes Queen after Charlotte. Washington, DC is called Victoria City.. And I think Victoria finally becomes Empress of America instead of British India. Read it ages ago..PPPS. Some of you actually think the French Revolution was at least partially an Imitation of the American Revolution. In the First Place the word “Republic” started to appear on the walls of Paris around 1750, under the reign of Louis XV. Far before America! In the Second Place proto-republican tendencies appeared in the French Religious Wars 1562–1598 among both Protestants and Catholics. Mainly due to the misrule of the previous Valois Dynasty up to 1589. And in the Third Place the French Revolution was way more radical and bloody as the American Revolution, causing a grand total of 2 million victims 1789–1799.",47 followers,Patrik Tsar,1.7K,0,0,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-revolutionary-advances-in-science-technology-are-or-have-been-held-up-by-insignificant-or-mundane-problems
