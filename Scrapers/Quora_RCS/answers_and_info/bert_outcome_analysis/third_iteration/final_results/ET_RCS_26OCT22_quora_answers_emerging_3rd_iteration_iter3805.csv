One thing I would change is to send it back a few years before WWI as Wikipedia contains the human history also, so there would be potential to learn from this and maybe avoid both WWI and WWII. I calculate that technology per Moore’s Law of doubling every 2 years or so, which means technology progression is not linear but rather 2^n exponential. Then having the knowledge of today back in 1910 could mean the progress can move at (2^n)^n, until it has reached today’s technology, then it would proceed again at 2^n. So this simple approx calculation can predict how many years it would take for them to catch up. I calculate 100-year progress using Moore’s Law to be 10E+15, so (2^n)^n to get to the same 10E+15 is between 14 to 16 years to leap to today’s 2020 technology. Thus it can be assumed that in 1910 + 15 = 1925, they would have equal technology of today.For those replies that are bogged down in trying to calculate how long it would take to copy the information by either printing it or writing it down, keep in mind that this is linear thinking and again technology moves in exponential progression per Moore’s Law. You don’t need to copy everything from the 10GB in a linear fashion. You just need enough technology to see how you can duplicate the information contained within, i.e. invent a method to copy of the 10GB in digital format (of which that information is within the Wikipedia pages) and that can now replicate in doubling and then doubling that, which is the exponential progression of Moore’s Law.","5,084 followers",Bobby Tatro,3.9K,2.2K,45.6M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Our-CTO-dont-allow-us-to-use-Linux-or-Mac-for-programming-because-he-is-a-huge-fan-of-Windows-he-said-Windows-has-much-advanced-technology-than-other-OS-and-he-want-all-developers-to-use-Windows-for-development-what

Nearly everyone in the medical field is working to prolong life and allow us all to be closer and available for our loved ones.Cancer, to put it plainly, is a label for “failure to keep consistent DNA”.Our DNA and protein structures replicate at an alarming rate. Faster than most of us would imagine. It’s mentioned that some parts of the human body replace themselves every few years. New skin cells, new hairs, muscles, and livers healing from alcohol (hehe). Billions of cells are replicated to heal damaged tissue. Billions of cells replicate to grow us into adulthood and beyond.When replication occurs, there is aACGTACGT becomes ACGTIn most cases, this is fine. A skin cell with an error in it will be created, it will live, it will duplicate, and then the skin cell will die. A human cell has 3.4 billion nucleotides, where only 2% are critical for protein expression. This allows small benign errors to not have an impact.However, some specific genes in that 2% are critical for cell growth and cell death. When the instructions for “grow every 5 days; die after 5 days” becomes “grow every 5 days; die after 15 days”, we call that “With more cells growing than they are dying, there is a greater and greater need for resources; cancer ends up stealing vital nutrients from other critical organs.So…It is not that science is holding back, but moreover science is still trying to understand it. It’s important to know how it works, how to control it, and how to make sure we don’t cause additional imbalance.When technology is created without rigorous testing, it’s working on assumptions. And assumptions can possibly hurt a loved one rather than help them. Worse, it may actually kill them.Today, at the cutting edge of cancer research, research is dealing with the billions of permutations that might occur. Some cancers are “grow every 2 seconds; die never”. Some are “grow every 5 days; die never”. Some are “grow 16 times every 1 second; die after 5 days”. Each one requires a different approach, therapy, or method of management.Today, science has already given us a few methods:Science is working on more methods:This poor mouse is helping humanity! Cow cartilage cells were implanted into the mouse and grown so we can better understand how we might grow and regenerate organs for humans. (It looks sad, but science is not blind. There are monuments that pay homage to these heroes. Like this one: (Altering the “force of nature” is what scientists all around the world are working to control. Unfortunately, Mother Nature is very mean when we don’t play by her rules. This is a great meme that’s been floating around:“Nature wants 5 of your 7 children dead. It wants you dead by 50. Everything better than that is brought to you by science and technology”At my lab, we are developing greater detection tools to identify mutations that cause cancer. We’re working on new methods to detect cancer in tissue, in blood, inFulgent Genetics - Leader in Next Generation SequencingIt’s a massive undertaking to combat the forces of nature. It takes time. It takes sacrifice. It takes generations of scientists to take the universe we are given and push it to allow just a few more years with our loved ones.I understand the anger, the worry, the wish to point fingers at science, at companies, at faceless entities for not preventing our losses.In June 2018 cancer has taken yet another one of my friends. Kind hearted. Friendly. Always willing to help. He went out of his way to get to know you, to understand your needs, to be impactful with the people he knew.I wish science already had the answers. That technology already existed. That nature wouldn’t take wonderful people away. This is my friendIt’s moments like these that reinforce why I work in science. Why We make technology.

I can't talk about exactly what it is unless you commit but if you do we'll make you into something that people wouldn't think was possible.Archie: That sounds scary. I'm not sure I should trust like that. Black guys have been experimented on before. Also, would it fuck me up? I mean would I still look like a normal guy?Charlie: I got the same treatment, in fact I was the first Army guy to get it. Do I look abnormal?Archie: No.Charlie: Despite that I could kill you from here without making a noise. I might be able to take out this half base by myself before people realized I was doing it.Archie: No way. But you don't seem like you're having me on. If you have that kind of power I want it too.","1,121 followers",Ann Silberman,971,381,2.8M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Our-CTO-dont-allow-us-to-use-Linux-or-Mac-for-programming-because-he-is-a-huge-fan-of-Windows-he-said-Windows-has-much-advanced-technology-than-other-OS-and-he-want-all-developers-to-use-Windows-for-development-what

Hidden (as the Orb) in an underwater temple that could only be accessed once every three hundred years on Morag (after a long, fascinating history with Eson the Searcher and other cosmic beings). While it is made pretty clear where it was, what we are not told is where exactly in the universe Morag is. For all we know it’s galaxies away from the Milky Way.The Reality Stone. (My personal favourite.) Used by Malekith (very poorly) to create the Aether and plunge the Nine Realms into darkness. For some reason. (Yeah, Dark WorldThe Time Stone. Now, this is the interesting one, because the earliest point in which the Time Stone is recorded is when the human sorcerer Agamotto found it and used it to create the Eye of Agamotto. Note we are not told where he found it. The assumption is often made that he just stumbled upon it on Earth, but I doubt this very much. We know that sorcerers are capable of travelling through realities, and a powerful one, like Agamotto must have been, could easily go planet, or even galaxy hopping. So there’s no telling where exactly Agamotto found the Time Stone.Finally, the Soul Stone. As Infinity War showed us, it has been lying, dormant, on Vormir, presumably since the beginning of time. So it is the only Stone for which we have a definite location of its origin. But what we do not have a fix on the location of is Vormir. So while the Soul Stone is on Vormir, Vormir could (for all we know) be anywhere in the universe.So, yeah. Saying they were all in the same galaxy is a bit of a leap.",0 followers,Izz,649,3.8K,34M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Our-CTO-dont-allow-us-to-use-Linux-or-Mac-for-programming-because-he-is-a-huge-fan-of-Windows-he-said-Windows-has-much-advanced-technology-than-other-OS-and-he-want-all-developers-to-use-Windows-for-development-what
