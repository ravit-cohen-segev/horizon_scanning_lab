0,"I don’t fear technological advances. I fear abuses of technology by people with malicious intentions, and I fear fragility caused by highly interdependent networks.There used to be a rumor that the Internet was designed in such a way that it could resist a nuclear strike, because it’s decentralized. That was never quite true. The domain name servers are decentralized, and that’s good, but there are enough bottlenecks in the cabling that one idiot with a backhoe can accidentally cut off Internet service to millions of people.

There has been a lot of testing of microwave cannons and other types of secret squirrel things for decades, and thus far the data has not been shared or stolen. But that will change I am sure.If a roque group with money is able to point one with any accuracy at satellites and starts shutting them down it could begin a chain of wrecks out there which will effectively shut down manned space exploration for decades.Same problems with nut jobs pointing their emitters at airliners.

As this happens some networks will perish. Networks that represent areas of interest, that are active (like Github) will become the norm.Crowd-sourcing: Crowd sourcing will accelerate and grow in many directions.There is a set of technologies that are traveling along the hype curve that will become simultaneously more mundane, powerful, and important over the next decade.Cultured agriculture products: milk, meat, silk, and leather have all had demonstrations or are in production but I believe we’ll see horn(keratin), wood, medicines, and analogs for most items in the grocery, furniture or lumber store over the next 20 years.Energy storage: The continued advance of Solar PV (Swanson’s Law) will make Solar cheaper than all other energy types through most of the world this decade. This will make the cost effective storage of energy paramount.Automated transportation: self driving vehicles will happen soon, they will be followed by drone transport and eventually (flying) drone transport for people. This will have enormous secondary impacts on commute distances and times.Artificial intelligence: today a good model to use for AI is anything a person can do in about a second, I expect that to double every couple years so that by the end of the 2020s an AI will be able to do something it takes a (trained) person 32 seconds to do. This sounds trivial, it is not. Driving is a waterfall of 1 second decisions, organizing a schedule between multiple people or writing a real report is much more complex and the “components” of those waterfall’s of decisions are 10 or 20 seconds.Robotics: better, faster cheaper robots will do repetitive tasks and manufacturing will fall to the same level of employment that agriculture hasAdditive Manufacturing: the cycle of development to go from idea to proof of concept to manufacturer good will plumet",0 followers,Lucas Martin,6.4K,65,4.2M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-technological-advance-do-you-fear-most-in-the-next-ten-years

Recognition-based or image recognition AR uses ‘markers’ in the real-world surroundings that the camera recognizes to overlay with digital objects. Marker-less technology scans surfaces relative to which objects are positioned. Applications with AR geo-positioning use a combination of marker-less technology and geospatial data. The overwhelming majority of AR apps are available on Google Play or App Store.Mark Zuckerberg wrote in January in his outlook for the 2020s: “While I expect phones to remain our most important devices for most of this decade, some time in the 2020s we will be getting groundbreaking augmented reality glasses that will redefine our relationship with technology. Tim Cook is also a fan of augmented reality. At the beginning of this year, he also called AR „the next big thing“.Thus, the CEOs of the two most known tech companies name augmented reality ‘the next big thing’, so it will probably be.
