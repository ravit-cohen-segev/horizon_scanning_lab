That would be a huge negative impact for innovation because the companies won't be able to sell as much good, services ... as today, so their income/revenues will be MUCH lower. The capital/investments for Research&Development will drop alot. Same with the governments, they won't have nearly as much money as today and so they can't spend in R&D in a scale as today. Still there will be innovation but just in a much slower pace. Maybe with new innovations like ""NeuralinkIt depends.

Maybe with new innovations like ""Neuralink"" by Elon Musk it could help us to connect human and machine and so we will maybe be able to innovate in a faster pace.","14,230 followers",Saran Udayakumar,2.3K,1K,29.3M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Are-we-reaching-a-technological-peak-or-will-we-inevitably-be-able-to-discover-develop-and-innovate

It’s still fairly crude, and limited by the physical size of the device.I think when we see a way to virtualize the input and output—say by projecting images into ordinary glasses (or better yet, contact lenses), and can give the mobile devices a better idea of what’s around them, we’re going to start seeing an explosion of new uses for the technology that’s as unimaginable to us right now as smartphones were in, say, 1965.Virtualizing the input and output allows the device itself to get as small as the power sourcA2A: No, I don’t think so.
