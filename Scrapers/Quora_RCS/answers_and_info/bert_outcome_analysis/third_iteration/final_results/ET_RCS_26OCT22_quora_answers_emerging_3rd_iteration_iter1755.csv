0,"Engineering has a mild boom-bust cycle of about 12-18 years duration. CS has the same, however, the base curve has been sharply increasing since the beginning of the Information Age.The result is a steady increase and then a tapering off of students entering CS, repeating against an ever increasing natural need. The proportion of students finishing CS programs decreases during the boom and increases during the downturn.During boom times, resources are stretched and many students enter who do not have sufficient desire, interest, or ability to perform well. Peer pressure to excel diminishes, amEngineering has a mild boom-bust cycle of about 12-18 years duration. CS has the same, however, the base curve has been sharply increasing since the beginning of the Information Age.The result is a steady increase and then a tapering off of students entering CS, repeating against an ever increasing natural need. The proportion of students finishing CS programs decreases during the boom and increases during the downturn.During boom times, resources are stretched and many students enter who do not have sufficient desire, interest, or ability to perform well. Peer pressure to excel diminishes, amplified by reduction in access to resources. Drop out rates increase.To combat that, many universities establish quotas. There is nothing more discouraging than to double the number of marginal graduates at the expense of classmates and resources. Remember that maintaining a good reputation is a benefit to past and future graduates.What is the impact of a downturn on CS grads? The number of offers may be reduced. You only need one really good offer.The bottom of the class at universities that do not maintain standards may get worse offers or need to move to related employment. They simply need broader development; however, they have proven themselves in a challenging discipline.Life doesn’t end with a degree. Your adult life is just starting. You know who performed best. Figure out how to pull together a company that is attractive inside and out. Recruit them. Outperform your classmates. Become a Regent.In the early 1980’s I was at an NSF review when a Dean of a noted university made the statement that CS would die now that people could afford their own personal computers. They would program them themselves. My thinking is that his definition of “people” was restricted to the faculty for which he was seeking NSF funding.For the rest of us, if you look at the problems society faces and the challenges that arise as we solve those problems, there is certainly plenty of opportunity for effective problem solvers.So, let me give you the best option, rather than the next-best option. Become a problem solver. Take care to deveop your traits into talent, develop intuition through study, and develop skill through performance. Open doors by seeking those who are developing habits of excellence.In other words, take Bill George’s advice, find your true north. Then get a move on. It is easy to correct your trajectory as long as you are moving.If that path takes you through CS, we will all be delighted to see you. But if you think the credential would be valuable to acquire, count the cost. There may be better alternatives.Personally, I recommend that you take the first 4 courses in CS, Into I and II, Data Structures, and Computer Systems. It will make a difference. You will understand what makes the Information Age clock tick.Regardless, if you are are planning your future, good for you. I wish you the greatest success.Best,Bill","129,189 followers",Jessica Su,6.8K,1.5K,49.7M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Will-majoring-in-computer-science-keep-me-up-to-date-with-new-and-upcoming-technology
1,"The logistic curveAt the beginning of college, some people seem much better at programming than others. You might conclude that those people are natural programmers, and everyone else has no talent for it.But really, they just spent more time programming. Like everyone else, they started at the left of the logistic curve. But as time went on, they moved to the right.As you spend more time coding, you too will move to the right of the logistic curve.The logistic curveAt the beginning of college, some people seem much better at programming than others.
