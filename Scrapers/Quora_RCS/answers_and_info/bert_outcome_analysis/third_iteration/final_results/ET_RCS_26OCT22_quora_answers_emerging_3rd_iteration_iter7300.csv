1,"Minning machines? A lot will side with me they are not needed anymore since master nodes are less stressful and yield good results. There is a project which has got a masternode very easy to set up and pays back pretty good. The Divi Project has got a Divi masternode which has got five tiers, and you can start by getting 100,000 Divi tokens.","3,398 followers",Raymond Scottman,1.1K,0,0,2020,https://www.quora.com/Could-all-cryptocurrencies-blockchains-be-recovered-after-a-solar-flare-storm

5,"Not remotely. But a solar flare, if powerful enough, could overload our power grid, shutting down the Earth like an EMP weapon, for weeks, possibly months. That would be a massive setback for human civilization (estimates for restoring normality run as high as $20 trillion) and would leave many people stranded without food or water. Very likely our data-crunching modern world wouldn’t survive, unless we had some pretty robust backups, all that info flowing on the net would be gone.",253 followers,Hadmat Singh Rajput,2.4K,277,897.4K,2019,https://www.quora.com/How-profitable-would-a-25-MW-solar-farm-be-for-mining-cryptocurrency
6,"Well, there are a few ways to answer this. I could say deforestation, rising temperature, destruction of the ozone layer, etc.Those things I just mention are the cause of humans. So I could say that we humans are destroying the Earth.Let’s zoom in further on the humans. All of these humans have a common goal, that is to get more money, more stuff at whatever cost. Apparently a lot of them will even do it at the cost of the Earth and everything in it.So the real answer to your question would probably be greed.

I think that is where the problems originated.Big mining companies are scraping in tons of cash from mining fossil fuels. Their obsession with getting cash is causing them to ignore the scientific facts that mining and using fossil fuels (coal, oil and gas) is literally killing our Earth.It’s not just the big mining companies fault though. Our greed contributes to it too. We need to start taking the warning seriously and put aside our want for more to really save the Earth.","105,675 followers",Dave Consiglio,3.4K,6.8K,91.6M,2021,https://www.quora.com/If-the-entire-world-accepts-cryptocurrency-as-the-only-form-of-payments-and-a-solar-flare-destroys-all-electronics-of-world-what-will-happen

Ideally with the paper statements from your bank, brokerage, credit union, etc. (oh you went paperless to save money and space so those are gone too quite likely…) you could prove that you had money in them and if they survived as institutions they might be able to repay you, eventually.So your money becomes what physical cash you had at home which may or may not still be honored or in such hyperinflation that it’s meaningless…i.e. what will people pay for a 1956 Chevy Bel Air unaffected by the EMP when it’s one of a few dozen cars in many miles that still runs? $50,000? $100,000? $500,000?Pat Frank was pointing this out in his long bestselling novel “Alas Babylon” 56 years ago as have most post-apocalyptic fiction authors since. Banks and brokerages are set up architecturally to look quite secure but being genuinely secure would cost too much.Not being able to access your money indefinitely or ever again very nearly happened to the entire state of Michigan during a very bad month in the bank panic/failures during the Great Depression as the guy who straightened it out, Jesse Jones head of the Resolution Trust Corporation (what would later be FDIC, FSLIC, OCC, SBA) relates that in his memoir. The biggest banks in the state that provided correspondent services to all other banks in the state were about to collapse, Jones drug their biggest investors who luckily ran the largest local businesses (General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler) who recapitalized the big banks with their manufacturing firms’ cash reserves along with federal loans.",152 followers,Alex Mann,1K,2K,102.8M,2019,https://www.quora.com/If-the-entire-world-accepts-cryptocurrency-as-the-only-form-of-payments-and-a-solar-flare-destroys-all-electronics-of-world-what-will-happen

12,"That is unlikely to happen but maybe we’ll see some interesting moves from the US government in this industry.The world slowly loses faith in the dollar when the US basically prints new ones to cover the old debt. That is unsustainable in the long run.Cryptocurrency like bitcoin has proven itself as a good and safe store of value and maybe it’s a good idea for the US to make BTC a new standard and issue dollars only when you have decent backing of BTC in vaults. In this case, BTC could skyrocket to millions per bitcoin.",3 followers,Steve Baker,555,27.4K,163.4M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Could-all-cryptocurrencies-blockchains-be-recovered-after-a-solar-flare-storm

Today, USD is the most reliable fiat currency in the world. Traded anywhere and everywhere in the world. However, in all its power, the United States Dollar is nothing more than a piece of paper. The value is what we see in the dollar.Another defining feature of the crypto is its universality and accessibility.
