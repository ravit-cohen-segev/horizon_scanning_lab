4,"Internet connected devices.Right now, there are a ton of devices connected to the internet. While the exact number is uncertain, the estimate for 2020 is 50 billion devices.The Internet is probably going to become critical for everything just because of how important it will become in terms of business, industry, and general knowledge. The Internet will be used to regulate machines a continent away, to raise awareness and especially for targeted advertising.Without the Internet in 2027, it would be unlikely that you would be able to keep up with the rapidly accelerating pace of technology andInternet connected devices.Right now, there are a ton of devices connected to the internet.

The Internet will be used to regulate machines a continent away, to raise awareness and especially for targeted advertising.Without the Internet in 2027, it would be unlikely that you would be able to keep up with the rapidly accelerating pace of technology and even more unlikely that you would be able to gain a job.Phones have been around for about ten years, and look how important they are already. Another ten years… they’ll be critical. In fact, they might even be built in our heads.This is of course speaking for developed countries. You don’t need to have Internet to get food, but you will need it for any sort of cause.If you were hoping for a new type of technology to lead the way, I’d recommend nanotechnology, but I don’t think ten years is quite long enough for it’s design to really take hold.The general connectivity of our world is only growing, especially with the Internet of Things (physical objects connected to the Internet) and having good Internet will be crucial for any endeavor.Hopefully this will give you a head start.","75,028 followers",Neman Ashraf,4.5K,410,37M,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-can-I-expect-from-the-next-decade-of-technology

6,"There can be little doubt about this. Both machine learning and the robotization of manufacturing processes are disrupting the way businesses operate as we speak.In March and April, Amazon hired 175,000 workers to manage a surge in online shopping. Firms offering products to facilitate telemedicine and online learning also took on scores of new employees. Many of these will stay, just as many pandemic-linked lay-offs will become permanent. There has been a surge in expected job reallocation from January to April, with 42% of lay-offs linked to the pandemic likely to prove permanent. Similarly,There can be little doubt about this.

There has been a surge in expected job reallocation from January to April, with 42% of lay-offs linked to the pandemic likely to prove permanent. Similarly, the shift to remote work prompted by covid-19 will leave a lasting impression. Of the hiring managers surveyed by Upwork, 62% say their workforce will be more remote than before the pandemic. (Source: The Economist)Ideally, these changes should allow humans to focus on the more creative and fulfilling aspects of work, delegating the more humdrum activities to machines, freeing us up to work less and focus of more rewarding and satisfying pursuits.Sadly, that is not how things work under the current dispensation. Businesses will simply look for ways to eliminate workers and subject their employees to a survival of the cheapest in a downward spiral. Without direct ‘government of the people’ intervention, the best ordinary citizens can hope for is some type of minimal universal basic income designed to stop us calling in the tumbrels.The majority of people need to have a job for their own self-esteem as much as to earn a living. Without meaningful work, emotional and psychological problems are likely to skyrocket.This is a conversation we should be having now, rather that blithely sitting back and hoping for the best.","135,508 followers",Hector Quintanilla,582,1.2K,88.5M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-can-I-expect-from-the-next-decade-of-technology

9,"The biggest technological undertaking of mankind to date will be the development and deployment of a carbon free, sustainable energy system.The energy sector is by far the worlds largest industry, and the only one countries wage wars over.

11,"Transfer learning in ML models.Humans are really good at generalizing. We only have to see a few dogs before we can recognize a dog when we see one.Machines are not. ML models require millions of examples before forming a reliable classifier, and that classifier is very specific to the data on which it was trained. If your training data doesn't include dogs with three legs, the model won't recognize them.

It's hypothesized that the reason humans learn so quickly is that we are fitting new examples into our existing knowledge rather than forming entirely new categories. If we could teach machines to do the same, they would learn exponentially faster and apply that learning more effectively.Transfer learning is a very hot topic in AI research right now, so I expect major breakthroughs in the next few years. I think this may be sufficient to achieve artificial general intelligence, but even if not, it will dramatically extend the range of tasks that machines can accomplish.","59,503 followers",Garrick Saito,1.4K,31.9K,172.3M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-can-I-expect-from-the-next-decade-of-technology

Once they had animal power, bigger fields could be planted, leading to irrigation technology and other aspects of agriculture development, including a method of keeping track of things, money and TAXES.That led to jewelry, more metallurgy, coins and the banking sector.Eventually they figured out how to attach a wheel to an axle and then they were off! They didn’t know at the time that the sky actually was not the limit.I just watched a show about the early telegraph and how people thought that once the world was united by undersea telegraph wires, and thoughts could be clearly expressed between nations, there would be no more need for war. Later this space age photograph was supposed to bring us all together.So that didn’t exactly work out.

Tesla can’t do that perfectly yet - and in any case self-driving cars without a human driver present are still illegal almost everywhere.Waymo do have truly driverless taxis - but they only work in very specific parts of very specific cities - and their rate of ‘fender-benders’ is truly horrific.All of the other car makers are struggling to get beyond the “Car stays within lane and has a cruise control system that slows the car down if it gets too close to the car in front.”…they don’t see road works, they can’t overtake autonomously, they don’t see red traffic signals. These are things that Tesla have been doing for years now.No matter what happens technologically - we don’t have fully autonomous vehicles until the law changes.But everyone EXCEPT Tesla - who don’t have remotely comparable systems - are going to try to stall that change in the law.
