It’s early days yet but it will be commercialized in the near future and 5G will enable them to run seeAs far as the world changing ones Graphene will be a massive game changer once we commercialize production. It is the strongest material known and 100 times stronger than steel and it is also very conductive, it will lead to extremely high performance computers which are much smaller than anything we have now, it will also be a game changer for batteries because Graphene batteries will not progressively deteriorate with every charge and can hold 10 times or more capacity compared to the lithium batteries we use now meaning computers and phones could potentially last several weeks between charges, Graphene is also one of the lightest materials known, to get this in perspective if you compare 1 square metre of Graphene with a square meter of paper the paper is around 1000 times heavier. Currently we are not sure exactly how to exploit Graphene's unique characteristics, but it looks likely we can combine it with composites and plastics to create materials vastly superior to anything we have now.Two more to watch are AI which could be at or approaching human level in 10 years and also without a doubt gene therapies which will revolutionise medicine.","135,529 followers",Hector Quintanilla,582,1.2K,88.6M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-technology-are-you-excited-for-in-the-next-10-years

It also doeBecause your definition of “innovation” is not innovation and Apple’s goals are different than yours.You added in a comment the things you think Apple should be doing to win the “Innovation” badge fromNone of those things would be innovative and none of them would further Apple’s goals and in fact, would make the company weaker. NFC outside of mobile payments has been a useless product and opening it up to developers has significant security problems. It also doesn’t make Apple money in any way. Customers in general doesn’t care about customization, in spite of what people constantly say. How would lowering repair costs be innovation? If that’s the bar for innovation, that’s an incredibly low one. Fast charging would be nice out of the box but it also would lower margins. How many people who would not buy an iPhone today would buy one if Apple had fast charging out of the box, lower repair costs, more customization, and um…NFC? The number is so low it’s negligible, so all of these would be BAD business decisions. Also I don't see how any of them would be called innovative. If Apple did any of these things, people would shrug and say Android did it first.Apple is hugely innovative. You mentioned a few from the last few years (in spite of your assertion that they haven’t innovated in ‘so many years’ but there are so many more. Apple Watch, the A-series chip (which enables the iPhone to be the only phone to do 4k 60FPS and 1080p 240FPS), AirPods, Face ID, and so many more that it’s not possible to count.Basically, your complaints aren’t that Apple isn’t innovative, because they clearly are, but because Apple doesn’t do the things you want them to do, even if it wouldn’t make them money (or in some cases would cost them money). The answer is, Apple is a business and is not in the business of pleasing you, but of making money. It’s working really well, which is why they are the most valuable company in the world.",0 followers,Tim Ventura,801,1.1K,11.5M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-technology-are-you-excited-for-in-the-next-10-years
