0,"In 1996 under Gil Amelio, Apple was determined to purchase a replacement multitasking Mac OS to compete with Microsoft’s Windows NT. The two main options he considered were Steve Jobs’ NeXT and Jean-Louis Gassée’s BeOS. (Another option was licensing Microsoft’s NT kernel.) Clearly NeXT was a great choice, and Steve Jobs and the iPhone ended up changing the world yet again. However, switching to Objective-C as the development language for Mac apps was NOT a huge win for Apple. Probably C++ would have attracted more developers.If Amelio had chosen BeOS, Apple would have had an excellent C++ baseIn 1996 under Gil Amelio, Apple was determined to purchase a replacement multitasking Mac OS to compete with Microsoft’s Windows NT.

However Apple would have been without Steve Jobs, and thus would have missed out on the iPhone. Likely Microsoft and Adobe would have continued Mac software development. Without the iPhone, I suspect Apple would have poured far more resources into Mac development. But Apple could not have become the world’s largest market cap corporation with just the Mac.","220,567 followers",Franklin Veaux,1.5K,47.3K,782.5M,2021,https://www.quora.com/How-successful-would-Apple-be-if-they-didnt-buy-NeXT-Technologies-Inc

2,"They bought NeXT for its operating system, simple as that.Apple had been a pioneer in the operating system business in the early 1980s, with the graphical-based systems of the Lisa and then the Macintosh. They’d stolen it from Xerox, but Xerox was clueless about how to market it, so Apple took it and ran with it. Xerox could stick to copiers, which they were already synonymous with.The problem is that Apple sat on its laurels with the classic Mac OS, failing to develop a next-generation version or do anything more than just add extensions to the original base that added instability to the systThey bought NeXT for its operating system, simple as that.Apple had been a pioneer in the operating system business in the early 1980s, with the graphical-based systems of the Lisa and then the Macintosh.

Xerox could stick to copiers, which they were already synonymous with.The problem is that Apple sat on its laurels with the classic Mac OS, failing to develop a next-generation version or do anything more than just add extensions to the original base that added instability to the system. To be fair, they did rewrite large parts of it with the move from System 6 to System 7, but System 7 was a steaming pile of crap anyway, and only succeeded because DOS and early versions of Windows were piles of crap that had been sitting out in the July sun for three days.Well, to make along story short, by the mid-1990s, Windows didn’t suck as bad as it once did. It had a UI that is still very popular today, and it had protected memory, and it had simultaneous multitasking, and it had a larger base of available software than the Mac did. It was just as unstable as Mac OS, but you could buy a Windows 95 computer for a fraction of the cost of a Mac.Apple needed a competitive response, and they couldn’t come up with one. They had a massive in-house project, Copland, designed to produce a modern Mac OS 8, but problems with feature creep and backwards compatibility with previous versions of Mac OS torpedoed it. An attempt to work with IBM on a new OS, Taligent, failed as well. By mid-1996, Apple was down to its last resort, which was to try to buy a new OS from someone who knew what the hell they were doing.They entered talks with Be, Inc., whose CEO Jean-Louis Gassee was a former Apple employee. Their BeOS was modern, but it was unfinished—at the time, it couldn’t even print. But that was something Apple could solve, especially with Be’s own engineers helping. The problem was that Gassee didn’t think Apple had any other possibilities, and he set a ridiculous price for an unfinished OS that included a high-ranking position for himself at Apple. Apple said no thanks.They went on to talk to Microsoft about possibly making an OS based on the Windows NT kernel, and they considered reviving Taligent, and at one point they considered using Sun’s Solaris, but one day, Apple executive Ellen Hancock was talking to Steve Jobs, who was still running NeXT, whose OS was arguably the most advanced of the era—but which was still a niche product. This explains its history a little better:During their conversation, Jobs pointed out to Hancock that the NeXT operating system was finished, highly advanced, and since it was based on Unix, highly portable to other platforms. In other words, it was precisely what Apple needed to get itself out of its OS quagmire and move to the head of the class.The story is available online if you want more details. Apple bought NeXT, got the OS it needed, and also got a much more mature Jobs back. While they adapted NeXT to Apple’s hardware, they “faked it” by adding the usable features from Copland development to Mac OS 8 and 9, which made those viable enough for the time being, and encouraged Apple’s existing designer Jony Ive to come up with a series of new and imaginative products like the multi-colored iMacs, to boost marketshare. Jobs took over as CEO and struck a deal with Microsoft to get some updated software (Office, Internet Explorer, etc.) that Apple needed to survive.So NeXTSTEP became Mac OS X, and the rest is history.","36,829 followers",Sylvain Saurel,3.2K,6.2K,265.7M,2021,https://www.quora.com/How-successful-would-Apple-be-if-they-didnt-buy-NeXT-Technologies-Inc

Non-voting stock is…. not terribly useful if what you want is to takeover a company. Apple could buy all the stock out there and show up saying “we have 70% of the stock! We win! We want Android to name all future versions after varieties of Apples!” And… Larry Page would say “but do your shares vote?” “Curses! Foiled again!”Except, Apple isn’t dumb enough to buy non-voting shares. So. Won’t happen.If you feel you know better, wIt’s not actually possible.
