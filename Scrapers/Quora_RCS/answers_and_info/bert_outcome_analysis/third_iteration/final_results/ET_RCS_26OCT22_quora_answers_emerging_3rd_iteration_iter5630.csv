Think of introducing yourself saying you work for company A. How does that make you feel? Now do the same with company B. Which one gives you the better feeling? Which one are you more excited about?",256 followers,Priyal Gupta,9.7K,0,0,2014,https://www.quora.com/If-I-get-2-job-opportunities-one-in-a-small-company-but-in-emerging-technology-and-another-in-relatively-larger-company-but-with-old-technologies-which-one-should-I-choose
1,"It depends.  I think the two major considerations are int he following.1. Are you sure about what you want to do?  Small companies are usually very demanding in effort and pay less.  The big reward is stock or stock option, which is valuable only when the company is successful. So there is a lot of risk involved.  I think small company is only worth doing if you are passionate about the mission and enjoy the hard work, even if it does not pay off in the end.  And if it turns out you don't like what the company is doing (technology) or you don't like the people you work with, there is little opIt depends.

I think small company is only worth doing if you are passionate about the mission and enjoy the hard work, even if it does not pay off in the end.  And if it turns out you don't like what the company is doing (technology) or you don't like the people you work with, there is little option other than changing job.  For a big company, you have stable income and pretty much predictable future.  And if you don't like what you are doing, there will be other opportunities within the company.  They also provide more training opportunities if you want to switch your line of work.  So if you are sure about what you want and are confident about judging a company's future and its culture, go to a small company.  If you just want to test water, a big company is a safer bet.2. Do you consider yourself better than average?  Small companies try to hire only good people, and they get a lot of freedom to do their job.  But they also have higher expectations.  If you think you are a ""good worker"" and are willing to spend extra effort to achieve extraordinary results, go for the small company.  Big companies, on the other hand, big companies know their staff has an average quality.  They put in places many processes and policies whose main goals are to prevent staff from making big mistakes.  So good people cannot really do much more than average ones.  If you think you are an average or below and want to have an easy life, no big achievements but still be comfortable, big companies are good places to go to.In general, I would suggest a new graduate to join a big company for a couple of years, to learn the basic surviving skills in workplace and some practical job skills such as writing good reports and contribute to meetings effectively.  More importantly, he can find out what he likes and hates in workplace.  Then he can join a small company and try to hit a gold mine.  In his late thirties, he can return to a big company and cruise through work, while taking care other priorities in life such as child raising.",18 followers,Asim Qureshi,2.4K,996,156.1M,2014,https://www.quora.com/If-I-get-2-job-opportunities-one-in-a-small-company-but-in-emerging-technology-and-another-in-relatively-larger-company-but-with-old-technologies-which-one-should-I-choose
2,"Classic dilemma.  High risk/high reward or low risk/low reward?  It's all about how much risk you can afford and how much you can stomach.

5,"Great question. Are we talking “filmmaking” or film? I’ll just assume it’s filmmaking. Yes, it will open up all kinds of new possibilities for the process, and if you want video games to completely take over the art of film, then I guess it’s a good thing. One of the many negatives is that even today we have moved into a fast food film industry era of filmmaking. I have been in the business for more than 20 years, and have been working directly with actors in the theatre both training and performing for that long as well.

One of the many negatives is that even today we have moved into a fast food film industry era of filmmaking. I have been in the business for more than 20 years, and have been working directly with actors in the theatre both training and performing for that long as well. The result of today’s tech-driven workflow has nearly destroyed the acting process. In the last 5–6 years it’s reached epic proportions. This begins with the auditioning process, and goes all the way through to the final edit. I could write a book on the details of how, but that’s an answer for another time. Yes, the A-list studios and actors are less effected by it, but I believe that will change as well in a very short amount of time.","246,860 followers",Dushka Zapata,1.5K,8.5K,232.5M,2019,https://www.quora.com/If-I-get-2-job-opportunities-one-in-a-small-company-but-in-emerging-technology-and-another-in-relatively-larger-company-but-with-old-technologies-which-one-should-I-choose

7,"This is what I did: the topic of my Master’s & my PhD thesis was the same. Even the title of both theses was almost the same.The reason?

As a result, you can proceed faster with your PhD as if you were starting from scratch.So if you adviser agrees — and if there is still something substantial to research — I don’t see any reason why you couldn’t have the same topic for your PhD as your Master’s thesis.","84,238 followers",Igor Markov,504,3.9K,49.8M,2019,https://www.quora.com/If-I-get-2-job-opportunities-one-in-a-small-company-but-in-emerging-technology-and-another-in-relatively-larger-company-but-with-old-technologies-which-one-should-I-choose
