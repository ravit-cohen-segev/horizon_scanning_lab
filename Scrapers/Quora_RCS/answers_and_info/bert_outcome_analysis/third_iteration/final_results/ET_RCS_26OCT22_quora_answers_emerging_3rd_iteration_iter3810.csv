The Rg Vedic people didn’t even leave behind buildings of the kind these civilizations did. Where are the Vedic structures comparable to pyramids, ziggurats, Sphinxes and massive cities? Sure we have lots and lots of myths about magical beings and people with magical powers, but so does every other ancient civilization. Nobody believes the Greek myths are true. Why should we take the Hindu myths seriously? The ancient Hindu philosophers treated as them stories meant for illiterate folk; what can’t we?And we can’t argue that everything the Vedic people built around 2500 BC has been lost. Harappa and Mohenjo-daro are far older and they still exist. The pyramids are older. The Sphinx is older. Heck, the walls of ancient Babylon can still be glimpsed.Many Hindus who take their stories literally seem to have a very confused chronology in their heads. They’ll say things like the Ramayana happened a million years ago. But the human species itself has been on this planet for just under 200,000 years. These early humans were hunters and lived in caves and didn’t have anything more sophisticated than stone tools. The earlier you go back in time, the archeological evidence shows that things get cruder and simpler and less sophisticated. The Hindutva has it backwards.If the Vedic people had super-advanced technology, you can be sure other civilizations would have noted it and written about it. No one did. Oh, by the way, writing evolved on the subcontinent only about 2000 or so years ago. We relied on oral transmission of texts. Can you imagine advanced technology without writing? If you read the Vedas, it’s clear those people didn’t have modern plumbing. They had nuclear power apparently, but no modern plumbing. How can that be?Agreed, the Vedic people were a clever, resourceful, warlike people. They took over the subcontinent. But they were not more advanced than other civilizations of the time. Indeed, the middle east civilizations (which were in close trade with the Indus valley civilizations) were considerably more advanced.If the Hindus who claim that we had all this marvelous technology could produce one device, one text with precise details— not stories or myths— then they would have a real argument. For example, everyone accepts that the Greece by the turn of the millennium (0 AD) were at another level when it came to fine machinery. We know this because we have found devices that prove their skill. See for example, the answer to this question:No such device has ever been found from the Vedic age. Instead we find the usual iron-age weapons and other artifacts.In short, the Vedic age didn’t have super-advanced tech, so there is no question of losing this fictional technology over time.",UNKNOWN,Raziman T.V.,517,2.6K,24M,2021,https://www.quora.com/India-has-very-advance-technologies-during-as-described-in-vedas-which-we-dont-have-today-and-In-todays-world-we-are-advancing-our-technologies-day-by-day-So-why-we-lost-ancient-technologies-instead-of-advancing-it

She turned to me and said, “Do you have washing machines in Scotland?” Obviously, I was forced to admit, that no we didn’t. Instead we just went down to the river and bashed our clothes off rocks to clean them.2) Transport - I spent two weeks in the lovely town of Columbia. Missouri. There I amazed the locals with my insistence on using a strange outmoded form of transport known as “walking”. Locals would slow down as they passed in their modern cars, pointing and laughing. To them, it must have been like watching a live action version of the Flintstones.3) Voting – would you believe it, but in the UK we still vote by drawing a little X next to the candidate we want to vote for. No sign of the advanced electronic voting they have over in the states. Indeed, we are so old fashioned that we haven’t even outsourced our voting to the Russians yet!4) Guns – It may be hard for an American to believe but almost nobody in the UK owns their own guns. This means that if we have to rise up and overthrow our own government (currently seems like a good plan) then we will be armed with nothing more than some particularly well sharpened sarcasm.Still, perhaps one day we can hope to be as advanced as the US.

16,"In a few areas, actually. First is infrastructure. The Chinese planned waaaaaaaaaay ahead while building. That’s why there were ghost cities.

Smaller cities have buses available that will take you just about everywhere within the city and bigger cities have subways as well as buses. For going between cities and provinces, China has a high speed rail system in place that is more extensive than the American highway system! For example: I lived in a city called Nanjing in China - about 200 miles/300 km from Shanghai. I could take a high speed train from Nanjing to Shanghai in about 1.5 hours!In contrast, I took an Amtrak train from Detroit to Chicago (about 300 miles/480 km) and it took over 8 hours!Another area China wins at is public utilities. They provide electricity, water, and gas for billions of people for very affordable prices! I paid maybe a total of $20 (US) per month for all utility bills, whereas it cost me over $100 in America! Atop of that is wireless technology (which is considered a public utility in China). I paid 100 rmb ($15) monthly for 16 GB of 4G data, with 1000 texts and 500 minutes of talk (which pretty much meant unlimited everything for me). In America I pay $50 a month for my unlimited plan. Yes, the 4G is a little faster, but that may just be because I’m not trying to access the foreign web here…A third area (kinda related to the second) is how the CCP controls markets and prices so everyone can live a comfortable life.

How powerful is the US?From the political, economic, scientific and technological, military, cultural, diplomatic, and other aspects. China can't compete with the United States in any aspect.A. The US political powerThe US election is the most concerned political event in the world. Any American president who takes office will influence the direction of the world.For example, Trump, an “incredible“man who could not be found for hundreds of years, became the president of the United States. If he is in other fields, it may not have any influence. But he is now the president of the United States.But it is not that he is terrible, but that the global leadership of the United States is terrible!If he is the leader of a very underdeveloped country, I don't think most newspapers will even report it.B. The strength of the US economyThe strength of the US economy can be seen all over the world. The United States has not only influence but control over the global economy!C. The US science and technologyThe US stands at the forefront of science and technology in the world. Most of the high technology in the world is in the hands of Americans or American laboratories. For example, today's China is developing its aerospace industry, which is an achievement that attracts worldwide attention. However, we all know that compared with the United States, we are inferior to the United States and the former Soviet Union at the beginning of the Cold War.But I think Leonard's genius is that a nerd can have a girlfriend like Penny.D. The US militaryThe US military ranks first in the world, and I believe no one will refute me.The largest conventional aircraft carrier in the world is the Kitty Hawk of the US Navy. This aircraft carrier has participated in many foreign operations of the US military.The United States Marine Corps, the firm executor of the national will of the United States, can basically defeat other countries with only one US Marine Corps.I don't think any country in the world would be stupid enough to challenge the United States militarily.5 steps to reshape the US military: Glean, Engage, Focus, Incentivize, and Share.The Kitty Hawk of the US NavyE. The US cultureAmerican culture is an important manifestation of American soft power. Almost everyone on earth knows Hollywood, and even some people may not know where the capital of the United States is, but they must have heard of Titanic and Rambo, an American hero who can beat hundreds of people by himself. Most written works in the world are written and recorded in English. American music is basically the trend. The American brand is basically the guarantee of quality. It can be said that where there are people, there will be American cultural influence, except for newborns in hospitals.TitanicRamboII. What are the advantages of China?China's greatest advantage is the people.From the military point of view, the PLA under the leadership of the Communist Party of China has no advantage in weapons and equipment. But the People's Liberation Army has accomplished every military operation task brilliantly. Because Chairman Mao said: ""The decisive factor in war is people, not weapons and equipment."" Is it true that China respects the US military because the US military has the most powerful weapons and equipment? No, it is because the extraordinary courage displayed by the US military on the battlefield deserves China's respect.Let me show you a couple of the examples that the power of people:A. What has the Communist Party of China done in the history of being regarded as a communist devil by the West?The first National Congress of the Communist Party of China was held secretly in this boat, Shanghai on July 23, 1921. The meeting was attended by only 12 people, announcing the founding of the Communist Party of China. Today, China has 90 million Party members.Under the military attack of the Kuomintang, the army led by the Communist Party was forced to move. The journey is more than 20,000 miles, also known as the 25,000-mile Long March. During the journey, it has traveled 25,000 miles through 11 provinces, 18 mountains, 24 rivers, deserted grassland, and rolling snow-capped mountains.After the Long March, there were only 30,000 Communist troops.In 1932, he was commissioned by the CPC Central Committee to organize the Anti-Japanese Coalition Forces in Northeast China and served as the commander and political commissar of the Anti-Japanese Coalition Forces. He led the soldiers and civilians to fight bloody battles with the Japanese aggressors in the northeast. In the extremely cold environment, under the emergency of running out of ammunition, he finally fought alone with a large number of Japanese aggressors for a few days and nights and died heroically. When the Japanese army caught him, they cut open his stomach and found that there were only bark and cotton in his stomach. He kept fighting by eating these. At that time, the Japanese army stood up and saluted, because Yang Jingyu was a very respectable fighting hero of Communist Party members.The Liberation War was a war waged by the Chinese People's Liberation Army under the leadership of the Communist Party of China from June 1946 to September 1949 to overthrow the Kuomintang rule and liberate the whole of China. It is a decisive battle concerning China's future and destiny. On October 1, 1949, the People's Republic of China was proclaimed in Beijing on the way of PLA marching to the whole country. In 1951, the PLA completed the task of liberating the mainland and offshore islands and the Communist Party of China unified the Chinese mainland.The Communist Party of China has done a lot of things. She made China independent, and at the same time, she led the Chinese people to work hard to build the motherland.Many overseas Chinese are constantly discrediting the Communist Party. It doesn't matter. More than one billion Chinese people now support the Communist Party of China. Is this party good or bad? If the Communist Party is really an extremely evil party, how can it monitor and control 1.4 billion Chinese people?Is it because China is really sinful that it keeps smearing China? Or something else?B. What are the strange characteristics of the Chinese people?Chinese people's character comes from Chinese culture. It is not deep to get in touch with the Chinese without understanding the Chinese character.China's college entrance examination is the exam with the largest number of participants in the world. The history of examinations in China has exceeded 1400 years.Every year in the college entrance examination in June, all cars in China will not whistle, so it is necessary to create a quiet environment for the candidatesParents waiting anxiously outside the examination roomExamination in ancient China. In the highest examinations in ancient China, the invigilator was the emperor. At the same time, any candidate who tries to cheat will be decapitated immediately once he is found.2. Chinese people especially like farmingChina's geographical environment determines that the people here will make a living by farming. Until today, as long as Chinese people see a good piece of land, they will not plant flowers, but grow vegetables.The picture above shows Chinese people growing vegetables in the Antarctic scientific research stations, deserts, university campuses, and space.3. Chinese people love saving money and grainWhen Americans were suffering from pneumonia in COVID-19, many people took to the streets. In fact, it is not necessarily opposed to wearing masks, but Americans do not have the habit of saving money. If the United States does not resume its economic activities, the American people will be unable to live because they have no jobs. But at the request of the Communist Party of China, 1.4 billion people stayed at home. Chinese people can stay at home for two months without going to the streets. It is because Chinese people have the habit of saving money. A country that has been poor for hundreds of years will not spend all its money once it has earned it.4. An incomparable yearning for peaceA unified and centralized country, a country with peasants as its main people, needs a peaceful environment most. Because it is impossible to fight there, I still farm here. Chinese people have always hoped to have a peaceful environment for them to cultivate their land, save some money, and then let their children receive a good education.5. Chinese people's deep love for their families and countriesChina attaches great importance to education. Therefore, Chinese culture can be preserved from generation to generation after thousands of years. In education, loyalty and justice are emphasized. This is why Chinese people have a very strong concept of territory and nationality. Every generation of Chinese will tell their children that you are a Chinese, that you are a Chinese who eat with chopsticks, and that you are a Chinese who write Chinese characters.A very famous story in China, Yue Fei, a famous general in Chinese history, had his mother tattooed his back before joining the army. There are four Chinese characters on it,Every Chinese has been fed with chopsticks in this way, which is calledEvery Chinese child will be taught to use chopsticks by his parents.When eating in China, only the elders say they can eat, and the rest can eat. This is called a6. Once oppressed too much, peaceful farmers will become fearless fightersIn Chinese history, all those who rebelled were peasants. As long as farmers have food to eat, they will not rebel. Once they are starving, Chinese farmers will rise to revolt. Therefore, Chinese people are not afraid of power in their genes. Indeed, many emperors in Chinese history were rebellious peasants. The earliest peasant uprising in Chinese history was the uprising of Chen Sheng and Wu Guang in 209 BC. At that time, the west was still the Roman Republic.What I want to say is that these characteristics of Chinese people come from China's poverty and backwardness, and also from its own understanding. Chinese people may be bullied, but it is impossible to kill all Chinese people.The US is powerful, and the American people are a symbol of freedom and independence. China cannot compete with the United States in any form.III. In the endThe US is the most developed country in the world. The US is ahead of China in every respect. China has been actively learning from the United States. Americans are Chinese teachers.But China does have its advantage, that is, its people.The national anthem of China today was created at the most dangerous time in Chinese history. Her lyrics are like this:起来！不愿做奴隶的人们！把我们的血肉，筑成我们新的长城！中华民族到了最危险的时候，每个人被迫着发出最后的吼声。起来！起来！！起来！！！我们万众一心，冒着敌人的炮火，前进！冒着敌人的炮火，前进！前进！前进进！Get up!People who do not want to be slaves!Build our flesh and blood into our new Great Wall!When the Chinese nation is at its most dangerous time,Everyone was forced to make the final roar.Get up!Get up! !Get up! ! !We are United as one, braved the enemy's fire,Forward!

22,"Here’s the thing about pyramids: they’re not complicated. They’re well-organized piles of rock. If you were to pile up a bunch stuff (dirt, rocks, whatever), you’d get something with a triangular cross section. Do it carefully to ensure there’s a square floor plan, and you get a pyramid. Tall buildings with walls going straight up and down, like the Gothic cathedrals, are significantly more difficult and technologically sophisticated than pyramids. All the pyramids need is a bunch of labor, and having a few thousand guys working on it over the course of twenty years will do the trick.As to howHere’s the thing about pyramids: they’re not complicated.

We’ve got, for example, a fairly detailed description from a Renaissance engineer about how he got a hundred-ton obelisk from Egypt to Italy and set it upright using rafts, rollers, ropes, pulleys, and lots of laborers. In short, nothing the Egyptians couldn’t have done.On the other hand, a lot of our knowledge is theoretical, some is experimental, and very little is practical. There are very few people these days who have the kinds of expertise to do that level of craftsmanship when it comes to the physical tasks of cutting and moving stone with long-obsolete tools and techniques.
