Once more Hellenic blood was spilled to protect the Western Civilization, and keep the Easterners at bay so the West had time to thrive and regroup, allowing the Europeans to have peace and prosperity long enough to stir the elements that gave birth to Enlightenment (also based on Hellenic Philosophies and Sciences).",168 followers,Tony Heagren,2.5K,215,1M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Why-did-Europe-develop-before-the-rest-of-the-world-Why-did-Europe-have-the-technology-and-might-to-colonize

I think some geographic reasons are key:People in Europe would have had to learn to store, conserve and plan for the months of cold, snow and shortage, forcing them to experiment with plants and machinery, build, plan and collaborate. They would also value adaptability, innovation and stable social systems.Other civilizations closer to the Equator dealt with a more consistent climate and more stable weather. Food was available in one form or another almost year-round, therefore there was less need for planning, storing and collaborating, and less need to look for resources further away.Winds primarily are westerly, so their ships could go up and down their coasts trading but couldn't sail against the wind, exploring. There would be less need to explore when you had everything you need at home.Characteristically, even now, Europeans are experimenters, explorers, planners, creative inventors and to some extent, social collaborators, characteristics that are  valued in modern Europe (+Canada, USA). They are also warlike and aggressive. They defend what they have, and take from others by force.This is NOT to say that other civilizations were lazy, incapable or unintelligent, but you have less pressure to be inventive if your basic needs - shelter from the elements, food and security - are easy to come by at home.My guess is that some of this is valid.","33,163 followers",Susanna Viljanen,1.5K,10.7K,165M,2016,https://www.quora.com/Why-did-Europe-develop-before-the-rest-of-the-world-Why-did-Europe-have-the-technology-and-might-to-colonize

China was arguably the most technologically advanced civilization before that point. The Ottoman and Islamic civilizations were ahead of Europe earlier than that, and at par with them till this time.Couple of things tilted the equation in favor of Europe:1. Political heterogeneity: An oft understated reason for Europe's rapid development, the lack of a large controlling state allowed people with ideas of all hues to survive. Especially when compared with China, where contact with external world was almost banned by royal decree, an European explorer would just move to another political state and continue on preparing for his future voyages.2. Black Death: While Black Death ravaged Europe, its impact on the Islamic states of Middle East was much greater. A comparatively sharp decline in population in the Middle East caused the total output of the region to sharply decrease. A centralized political system, however, meant that any surplus was immediately taken up by the ruling elite plunging the masses into even greater states of poverty and deprivation.3. Religion and Society's Relationship with Nature: Christianity in Europe evolved to view the extraction of value from nature (motion from water, heat from coal, food from earth etc) as natural and in line with religious edicts. This allowed the population in general to experiment in developing new tools and technologies to improve their general lives. The Chinese, on the other hand, treated nature as something that needs to be preserved in its current state. Technological innovation just became a little more difficult for them.4.

American cultures simply didn't get the time European and Asian cultures had had to reach certain cultural levels.A predominant West-East orientation allows the spread of domesticated plants and animals. Climate and thus weather conditions remain constant over large distances and therefore domesticated plants and animals can spread more rapidly and over longer distances.

This might even exist among animals. In dog training this is called desensitization. Europeans took this to another level, Materialism, whereas other nations were too emotionally attached to their traditions and couldn’t break free.That’s about it! >>>Explanation:Europe became Europe mostly thanks to Roman Empire, which learned a lot from Ancient Greece. Romans were profoundly materialistic, for the most part. They had their money on their minds.The Romans were not as philosophical as ancient Greeks. But Europe didn’t become as such because of Science. Matter of fact none of the Early Industrial Revolution needed science. First and foremost ocean crossing galleons that allowed colonization was a technology with little science involved (they didn’t have calculus back then). Steam engine, locomotive, cotton gin, factories, these were all practical apllications with very little math. There is a famous saying: Steam Engine did a lot more for Thermodynamics than the other way around.Science emerged as a by-product of Technology. And Technology emerged because Europeans were more occupied with material life instead of heroism and mysticism like the rest of the world.But how did they become as such?Someone mentioned a geographical reason. I do not agree with the East-West vs. North-West orientation story. However, after he mentioned this, I realized some other factor: Islands.And this is how it all happened:Islands => Small kingdoms => Freedom => Individualistic thing => Materialism => Scientific thinking => Technology => Weapons => Conquests => More money => More technology => More weapons => More conquests …Europe was like Americas in the Bronze Age. While Middle East was enslaved by iron fist (or rather Bronze fist then) Emperors backed by hardcore religions, Europe was enjoying peaceful existence in the form of small tribes.Then ancient Greece came about, just in the right time and place. Because of all the small islands in the Aegean and the general geography of Greece, the city states were not conquered for long time, although Darius tried hard as you know and if he succeeded there probably wouldn’t be Europe.So, being at safe distance from god-like Emperors of the Middle East, Greeks were able to enjoy relative freedom and individualism. With this came democracy and innovation. Innovation arose because people wanted to invent new things to sell. Then they started thinking.. and thinking.. and as they thought they realized some things. Then some wise men connected the dots etc. Scientific thinking was established.This all happened before Alexander the Great brought Middle East brutality to the peninsula. Had someone like him been able to conquer and unite all of Greece 300 years earlier, maybe there wouldn’t be Europe again.But as said the rest of Europe was pretty materialistic to start with. Take Rome for instance. The city was founded by criminals. Literally! Read its history.Anarchists, outlaws, bohemians.. these were necessary for free thinking. Somehow Europe was not able to produce a Moses-like figure, and that was their luck. I think the geography of Europe played a big role in this.But all changed when Europe imported their first big religion. Notice the slowdown on scientific thinking starting 100 CE. That lasted until 16th century. It took them 1500 years to get rid of it, at least enough to set materialism and scientific thinking free.To those who would argue that the education system of the Catholic Church helped the Industrial Revolution: the guy who started the Industrial Revolution is this one here:You all know James Watt, but it was Thomas Newcomen, an iron working expert, who invented the steam engine. Yes, he was a christian, but as I said elsewhere, Catholic Christianity had the materialism of Roman Empire. That can be seen even in how the crusaders handled things like a financial business rather than a holy undertaking. The Anglican church was even more materialistic.Check this from Wikipedia as a proof that Church of England ran like a business more than anything:”Newcomen's connection with theUtterly materialistic. People to this day go to church for money connections. Don’t kid yourself. Most Christians are not like Muslims and Budhists who are obsessed with “reaching spiritual elevations”. Recently all religions are following the Anglican Church model (the most materialistic of all) and the entire world is essentially “European” save for several pockets that are resisting Westernization: ISIS, Taliban, etc.To add: Now the banner of progress has passed on to Chinese. Why? Because they are even more materialistic, thanks to communist past. They will succeed, until the material itself, that is robots, come and take over the government of the world.Edit: Some answers suggest that the the Church was the catalyst in establishing the Universities. True. The institutionalized education of universitas were based on Church system. However, without the Materialistic background of Arithmetics and Physics, Church education would be worthless for Science. Church did not allow Materialism on purpose. It had to. People did not go to Universities for Theology. They wanted to learn Arithmetics and Algebra. So the Church had to give them Charter, that means leave them alone. Had not Church allowed Science in the Universities, not many of the smart people would go there.Edit2: Some argue that Romans did not invent much and instead they popularized existing inventions. This might have some truth to it, but this does not preclude the fact that Romans were utterly materialist. I did not say materialism automatically results in technological progress. If the people are spoiled it might result in debauchery, for example in current US. That said, Romans did invent many things and improved many others. The line between product development and invention is very blurry. Even Steam Engjne was more of an engjneering feat than an invention out of the blue.Materialism here means the lack of emotional attachments (except towards money $$$), or the ability to look at the world as it is, material. To build new things you need to break old bonds. Sad but true. Europeans were able to do this because they did not have emotional attachments to begin with. That is what I meant. Greeks had gods but they weren’t too attached to any one of them. Even Zeus was not perfect, he was a debaucher at times. That did not happen elsewhere. In middle east gods were perfect. They did not have any imperfections and no one ever dared think otherwise. Europeans did not take the bible too seriously either. They did not have traditions like circumcission for instance.The fact is, when you look at things “scientifically”, you take yourself out of the equation. The more logical we got, the less emotional we became. An ideal person for “civilization” would be a human without emotions. It is impossible to achieve such human, therefore civilization will settle for the current possible option: robots.",UNKNOWN,Ke'Aun,2.9K,1.1K,21.9M,2022,https://www.quora.com/Why-did-Europe-develop-before-the-rest-of-the-world-Why-did-Europe-have-the-technology-and-might-to-colonize

Trying out something new was considered foolish, instead one was supposed to do what the Elders have always done.Then a couple of very important events happened in a rather short time span:1440: Johannes Gutenberg invented the Printing Press, which made it possible to print books and pamphlets and led to information and knowledge spreading much faster. Here is a reconstruction of the press he built:Unlike China who had invented a different kind of printing press in the 8th century, Europeans wrote all their books by hand all the way until the Gutenberg press was invented. Before, new knowledge often did not make it into the very expensive books, because they were meant for „solid knowledge“ and used for centuries.You see, that was like going from no phone or no internet, to suddenly having it all.1492: Columbus sailed westwards and reached the Bahamas. You probably know that already, but he wanted to find a shortcut to Asia and didn‘t even realize he had discovered another continent. This continent had been, of course, discovered several times before. By its inhabitants and by the vikings, but all of this was forgotten and unknown to most of the world.After Christopher Columbus had died, an Italian cartographer and explorer named Amerigo Vespucci sailed across the sea again. He concluded that this was actually a whole new continent. He wrote a letter about the new world and thanks to the printing press, it was copied and spread through Europe like crazy. The letter is quite interesting. He describes interactions with Natives in nowadays Brazil. It is still read a lot in Latin Classes in Europe. It‘s called Mundus Novus and you can find it online for sure.The German cartographer Martin Waldseemüller then made the first world map including the „New World“ in 1507. In honor of Amerigo Vespucci he decided to call it America and somehow the name stuck.Anyways, ALL OF THIS was so contrary to what Europeans had always thought: That all of the knowledge about the world is in the bible, that there is nothing the Elders don‘t know. And people got curious. They started to question everything.It all led to a who a whole new surge of inventions, explorations and scientifical discoveries.Of course it wasn‘t all neat and nice. We all know that the Europeans did not respect the inhabitants of the new continents as equals. They simply took over their land, killed or ruled over them.It is interesting, however, that even though it was soon known that there was a new world, the Western and Southwestern countries in Europe were the only ones who were trying to claim a piece of the cake for themselves. The rest of the known world merely watched and did not seem interested in pursuing the Unknown.And this is exactly how Europe, especially Western Europe, advanced much faster than the rest of the World. Pursuing the Unknown, questioning themselves, breaking with tradition and thinking of themselves as superior.","33,163 followers",Susanna Viljanen,1K,10.7K,165M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Why-did-Europe-develop-before-the-rest-of-the-world-Why-did-Europe-have-the-technology-and-might-to-colonize
9,"Adding a few more pointsAdding a few more pointsIn Middle ages Europe made progress in science due to her contact with the Arabs who in turn learnt many things from the Indians(After all we are the basis of everything ;)).This led to renaissance in science. The first major breakthrough in knowledge of modern science was made in astronomy. Over a period of a century, scientists like Copernicus Kepler, Galileo Newton, Hippocrates revolutionized the fields of Astronomy, Mathematics, Physics Chemistry , Medicine.3. Renaissance in science resulted to scientific inventions and industrial revolution. The destructive use of gunpowder was discovered and the European rulers held monopoly in this field. Worth mentioning first practical steam engine too was developed in 1764.4.

I want to you to make a software that can create a blackhole with household items.What is the first point that comes to your mind?Answer - you are idiot. That’s not possible.Yes that where you have to control your mind. Whenever someone tell you something don’t just give up hearing it. First try to dig up and then go off the limit before saying the case is closed. ( well the problem I suggested is extremly difficult. I wanted to put a hard example only. Our mind give up in far simple issues, when you will learn a language and you know a certain way only to do a task. Mind give up even to change a little code because we think it’s hard to debugs if an error occurs. )2- Reading -Video tutorial will let you start but if you want to be a good developer you should be good at reading because 90% of time documentation or others code will help you and if you are not good at reading and implementing that code. You will have a hard time.3- The best developer is who switch between technologies easily. There are a lot of developer who think - “ I am a php developer and I can’t do javascript” . Suppose they are making a project for themselves. They will code everything in php but will never try to make a simple mobile app because they think it is not there field and the point one apply.Now to become a good web developer, there are a lot of languages and everyone is having advantages and disadvantages. You can ever do webdevelopement in java and by the defination of a good web developer - A developer that can code anything according to requirement. You may find yourself learning the hardest of programming languages. Example you need to implemet shortest route in your web app and that’s to adaptive. Need machine learning. So you should know everything according to this.But as a starter you may start with php and then move on to Java script.",18 followers,Asim Qureshi,16.3K,996,156.1M,2017,https://www.quora.com/Why-did-Europe-develop-before-the-rest-of-the-world-Why-did-Europe-have-the-technology-and-might-to-colonize

There are a just 9 member companies from Israel in that whole organization; they are all under the roof of ETSI, the European Telecom Studies Institute. And only two of them are research oriented: HERON and Tsofun Algorithm ltd. The others are manufacturers. And I am not aware of any contribution on their side. But I must admit, that I haven't searched the database. Everything in 3GPP is documented and publicly available.Main contributions to the standardization process are difficult to assess. The “patent share” is just an indication, since the main work is done jointly in the sessions (and honestly: by negotiating during the breaks), since 3GPP will always find a consensus solution.But check out the 5G patent share.Note that is is leaning a bit towards China/Korea for a simple reason: there are a lot of patents in the phone area (that is why Samsung is on top), and for China, they are heavily working on 5G TDD, they own “dialect” of 5G, which naturally produces lots of patents.But how did you arrive at your conclusion that 5G was developed in Israel?And by the way: 5G is not there yet, technically. All we are talking about here is standards. Network equipment and phones are still in the final design process. There is no single operational 5G network anywhere in the world.The production of 5G networks will be entirely in the hands of Ericsson (Sweden), Huawei (China), Nokia (Finland) and ZTE (China). On the handset side it will be the usual “suspects”, with the assistance of Qualcomm (US), a critical resource in providing chipsets to the industry.","9,893 followers",Kenzi Mudge,1.8K,1.3K,8.3M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Why-did-Europe-develop-before-the-rest-of-the-world-Why-did-Europe-have-the-technology-and-might-to-colonize

You can learn almost everything about blockchain within only 2–3 months.I also put the time behind how long each point will probably take:Once, you have done that, you are already very far ahead in terms of blockchain development. There are probably less than 1,000 developers that have done the above things and there is currently a lot of demand for blockchain developers.Currently blockchain developers are mostly only needed by people who want to start their own cryptocurrency, which aren’t that many.Once banks, government, large companies will start to adopt blockchain, this need will explode, because blockchain will go into the mainstream.If you want to complete your blockchain knowledge and know everything about blockchain development, you can also do these 2 thingsThen you are probably among the most experienced 200 blockchain developers worldwide and very in demand.ConclusionSo, these are the steps to become a real blockchain developer. This all only takes 2–3 months in total, so the learning curve is very steep.I believe blockchain developers will be the developers most in demand in 2 years, so it’s definitely a worthwhile investment.The best way to learn this is by joining a blockchain company, so this way you will actually get paid.There are only a few dozen blockchain companies per country right now, but they are looking for good developers all the time.Some good ones areThey all already have several blockchain projects and some also a couple of ICOs under their belt and are looking for good developers.If you found this answer helpful, please give an upvote.","10,687 followers",Daniel Tunkelang,824,685,4.9M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Why-did-Europe-develop-before-the-rest-of-the-world-Why-did-Europe-have-the-technology-and-might-to-colonize
23,"Both are about data. Soon every industry will start using AI/ML and will have “AI first” policy like they now have “cloud first” and “mobile first”. AI/ML have displayed tremendous potential and it will continue to grow. There is significant skills gap and open positions are not easy to fill. Blockchain skills might give you an edge but would be niche area as compared to AI/ML and there would be more learning curve; but all that depends on you current skills, interests and industry knowledge.","50,710 followers",Håkon Hapnes Strand,1.7K,4.4K,85.9M,2017,https://www.quora.com/Why-did-Europe-develop-before-the-rest-of-the-world-Why-did-Europe-have-the-technology-and-might-to-colonize
