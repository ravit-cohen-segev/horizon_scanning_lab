Why we think of combustion as so important has to do with it’s ability to create a heatsource that causes a rapidly expanding pressure wave. But it’s not neccesary in all cases.Even in cases where you need fuel to generate an explosion doesn’t mean you need air.Hypergolic fuels such as dinitrogen tetroxide and Hyrazine which were used in a lot of older ICBM’s provide the oxygen needed for combustion on their own without requiring air.So what you need for an explosion is a pressure wave moving faster than the speed of sound in an uncontrolled direction, which means you need a medium for the wave to propagate through otherwise it’s just shrapnel and frags.So early in the battle, right after Lando suggested moving the fleet into engage the star destroyers, you see a number of attacks, including an X-wing pilot screaming, “she’s going to blow!” while one of the geodesic shield generators on the STar Destroyers brige structure demolishes itself from an internal explosion taking out it’s shields. Later the B-wings of Blade Squadron come in and take out the controls systems for the hyperdrive reactor, which is essentially how you destroy an X-wing, either super-heat the reaction so that it destroys it’s containment vessel and expands outward or you destroy the ability of the system to control itself and let it tear apart, similar to what happens in a refinery explosion.What might be different is the Death STar reactor in return of the Jedi which is exposed to space with no atmosphere around it, just a hawking node or something produced between the poles of the reactor to produce energy by crushing matter in a gravity well-who knowsSo this is another case of destabilizing the reaction in the hyper matter chamber (above) which is why Wedge attacks the power regulator on the North Tower and Lando shoots concussion missiles at the emitter node, which causes a small explosion from the nexus of the reaction. Now the reactor collapses and goes critical, vaporizing it’s core and fires break out and secondary explosions are going off, but you’ll notice the deathstar is still in tact when the Falcon bursts from the flames-and then you see that sudden flash and then the detonation as if a much larger event than the explosion of the hypermatter reaction had happened. Here’s a notion, the crushed space created by the hawking node itself expanded and what destroyed the Death Star was a massive gravity wave similar to what we detected with the LIGO array in 2015, which was the result of two black holes colliding 1.3 billion light years away. Talk about unforgettable.So in summary, it’s realistic that with pressurized Spacecraft, you’d see combustion of either fuel or of the atmosphere in the ships itself, but despite the massive damage and loss of life the fire would cause on it’s own, the principle destructive force comes from the power systems that the ships use to propel themselves.-just me thinking out loud.",181 followers,Kenny Nguyen,1.3K,2.3K,45.8M,2018,https://www.quora.com/How-do-spaceships-explode-in-fire-in-Star-Wars-with-no-oxygen
1,"The initial explosion would be caused by the sudden decompression and expansion of the air in the ship and the flames would be caused by the fuel igniting.The spaceship probably contained large stores of oxygen for both the fuel and life-support, the ship would have also had large stores of fuel. These two things would have completed most of the fire triangle (oxygen, fuel and heat) and i assume that what ever caused the explosion would have caused enough heat to complete the triangle.","1,012 followers",Quinn Hesters,678,563,5.9M,2018,https://www.quora.com/How-do-spaceships-explode-in-fire-in-Star-Wars-with-no-oxygen

There are three critical flaws Disney made.When Disney bought Lucasfilms, they declared all the Star Wars books non-canon and cancelled the Star Wars cartoon series.That was the first step, because now it became extremely hard to create a new Star Wars movie. People did not like Force Awakens because it was a copy of a New Hope, and while I do see that, I actually liked it.So when Disney tried to create a different film called The Last Jedi, it turned out to be the most polarizing Star Wars film of all time, even more than Empire Strikes Back.I am going to go off topic, and talk about the MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe). Part of the reason why the MCU did well is that most of the movies were based on source material. I can easily tell that Spider Man Homecoming had materials based on the Ultimate Spider Man comics. Or Thor Ragnarok had elements from Planet Hulk.Another advantage the MCU had was that it not only had the source material, but the directors and actors would research on stories that were bad, and they would make it better.For example, in Civil War comics, the fans didn’t like it because Tony Stark was acting out of character, and he was a mean guy. The Russo Brothers adapted the Civil War storyline for the final Captain America movie, but they changed the argument of the movie to make it easier to understand, and they also made Tony Stark more sympathetic.What I am trying to say, is that Disney could have done something similar to the MCU. Disney could have make a sequel trilogy with the same characters, but use some elements of the Star Wars Legends stories in their trilogy to make it more cohesive. But Disney wanted to wipe the whole Star Wars slate clean, and that was their first flaw.The second mistake Disney made was that they:2. Disrespected Star Wars characters, and introduced boring charactersIn an interview with George Lucas, Kathleen Kennedy stated that the whole objective of the sequel trilogy was to “preserve and protect the characters.”I can understand Han Solo having to die, and the tragic death of Carrie Fisher. But I can’t ignore Luke Skywalker, and how he had his character ruined (his death was fine).People can argue whether or not Luke Skywalker was out of character when he tried to kill Kylo Ren in his sleep, but the fact still stands that Luke Skywalker was divisive among fans. No one can argue with that.Out of all the characters, Kylo Ren was the most interesting and memorable one.He was a force to be reckoned with, and in Rise of Skywalker he was threatening. But he was overshadowed by a bigger enemy, which is a prevalent problem in the sequel trilogy.Finn had the biggest potential wasted, Rey and Poe were bickering. Captain Phasma, Snoke and General Hux were disposable. Out of all the characters, even Rose Tico was wasted.No one is going to remember the characters except Kylo Ren. The only characters worth remembering are the characters that were ruined or wasted.Finally, the third reason how Disney ruined Star Wars:3. They did not have a clear outline/plan for the trilogyWe can talk trash about the prequels all we want. The prequels had clunky dialogue, the characters felt hollow, the pacing was horrendous, the plot was uninteresting.But at least it had a clear objective/goal. At least the prequels were consistent. In fact, as time went on the prequels got a bit better.The sequel trilogy had no goal whatsoever. I think The Last Jedi was the movie that ruined Star Wars forever. People may bag on the Force Awakens for being too similar to A New Hope, but at least it was still enjoyable and cool.The Last Jedi completely went in the opposite direction, and had plans that were different from The Force Awakens. The decisions the Last Jedi made were not how JJ Abrams envisioned, and that led to the downfall of the sequel trilogy.The worst part was that the Star Wars sequel trilogy got consistently worse for me.No one can change my mind that the Star Wars sequel trilogy had a clear, consistent vision.In conclusion, the three main reasons Disney ruined Star Wars were: declaring the Star Wars expanded universe “Non-Canon”, disrespecting characters and not creating memorable characters, except Kylo Ren, and not having a plan.","1,805 followers",Doyen Rainey,705,1.3K,9.5M,2019,https://www.quora.com/How-do-spaceships-explode-in-fire-in-Star-Wars-with-no-oxygen

Only South Africa, of all nations that have built atomics since the Second World War, followed the lead of the United States and built gun-type weapons as their first devices. Plans existed to build improved weapons, with all sources I have read in agreement that these would have been “boosted fission” bombs. Secret cooperation with Israel’s very advanced nuclear weapons program was at the heart of these plans, but it is not clear if the idea was to make boosted fission gun-type bombs (possible in theory but apparently never done to date) or implosion weapons.From the paper, “Out of (South) Africa: Pretoria’s Nuclear Weapons Experience”, by USAF Lt. Col. Roy Horton:The (South African) military reportedly did play a leading role in coordinating clandestine arms and technology transfers between South Africa and Israel. This included the transfer of approximately 50 metric tons of South African yellowcake (uranium ore concentrate) in exchange for 30 grams of tritium to support AEC work on boosted fission weapons. Other exchanges of military technology and work on joint ventures reportedly included technical knowledge acquired from the cancelled Israeli ""Lavi"" fighter program to the South African Cheetah fighter and the joint Israeli-South African space program. The latter effort provided South Africa with a ballistic missile delivery capability using a modified Jericho II missile.The AEC scientists were relegated from a position of ""first to worst"" in terms of influence over the nuclear program. They resigned themselves to researching boosted fission weapon and implosion weapon designs for which there was no customer and no hope of increased funding. ARMSCOR did bring several AEC scientists over to its Advena Central Laboratories late in 1988 to support its implosion weapon research but the program was canceled before much work could be accomplished.https://fas.org/nuke/guide/rsa/nuke/ocp27.htmSouth Africa and weapons of mass destruction - WikipediaLaviThe Cheetah Was South Africa’s ‘Good Enough’ FighterAll atomic and thermonuclear detonations are the result of an overload of “fast neutrons” running into and smashing apart numerous nearby atoms that make up various fissile materials in the core of the weapons. The keys to efficiency are therefore various techniques for 1) keeping the prompt supercritical reaction (the detonation) confined for as long as possible before the bomb blows itself apart, thereby 2) increasing the numbers of neutrons striking their fissile material targets, and 3) reflecting as many escaping fast neutrons as possible back into the fissioning core in order to further augment the blast yield by prolonging and enlarging the reaction. All of this takes place in a fraction of a second.In thermonuclear bombs, the fission detonation is used to produce the enormous temperatures and X-ray emissions necessary to provoke nuclear fusion—a second “stage” in the detonation that occurs almost instantaneously with the first, or “primary” stage (the fission detonation). Additional stages can be added on to make the explosion even more powerful, though so far as is known, no one has attempted to build a weapon that utilized more than three (3) stages. According to Chuck Hansen’s extraordinary work,How Do Nuclear Weapons Work?Nuclear Weapons PrimerWhy No One Will Ever Build Another Nagasaki Type BombAre there three-stage nuclear weapons as opposed to the two-stage thermonuclear weapons?B41 nuclear bomb - WikipediaThermonuclear weapon - WikipediaDismantling the mega-nuke: America begins to take apart B53 that was 600 times more powerful than bomb that flattened HiroshimaFoam Plasma Mechanism Firing Sequence in a Thermonuclear Bomb.Diagram and Accompanying Text is Taken Verbatim From the Wikipedia Article “Thermonuclear Weapon”.Note that none of the sources above discuss Uranium-233, another fissile isotope of uranium. U-233, like plutonium, is most often produced in a reactor. It has the additional advantage of utilizing thorium-232 as its raw material, with thorium being three to four times as abundant on Earth as uranium. In recent months I have noticed the apparent disappearance from the web of articles discussing the utility of U-233 in nuclear weapons, as well as those regarding a process pioneered at Oak Ridge, TN, by Union Carbide, known as THOREX. Broadly similar to the PUREX procedure that removes impurities from reactor-produced plutonium, THOREX dates back to the 1950s and would presumably be fairly well known among nuclear chemists, physicists, engineers, weapons designers, and so on. Both the United States and the Soviet Union tested bomb designs that were powered at least in part by U-233 in the first decade and change after WWII. In addition, India is known to have used U-233 in at least one underground test detonation (the “Shakti V”) and so given that all of this is nothing new, I am at a loss as to why some information is no longer available. Note also that theLittle Boy - WikipediaThe first Manhattan Project implosion bombs utilized a series of explosive lenses that all had to be triggered simultaneously in order for the subcritical pieces of plutonium to be fired into the core so that they would detonate. It appears that at least some German nuclear weapons concepts from the Second World War likewise relied on implosion, but arrived there via shaped or hollow charge explosives rather than the more complicated lens-and-fusing system used in the US-Allied weapons. It is said in the sources I have read to date that the prototype boosted fission tactical nuclear weapons which were tested twice near Ohrdurf, Germany, in March 1945 utilized this approach.

This is often a goal in so-called “fourth generation” nuclear weapons research. Two mechanisms for achieving this have been suggested or alleged in the sources that I have read.

13,"The maximum velocity available directly from fission is in the range of 20 MeV neutrons. And that is isotropic, that is, in all directions. And the velocity of gasses from a bomb are significantly less, on the order of several thousand m/s or 1/10th an eV.The effectiveness of a propellant decreases as the velocity of the spacecraft increases.

This suffers from several problems: at best you can harvest 50% of the power, and at best the exhaust is going perhaps 1% of light speed.

The highest speed we could make would be in the hundreds of millions of eV, literally relativistic, and at those speeds, the craft could reach a significant percentage of light speed. Of course, that requires a lot of energy, and a way to concentrate it.The highest velocity we can conceive of getting would be done by using a nuclear power plant and a high energy particle accelerator. The highest velocity we could get would be by using the waste stream of a nuclear reactor, with the lightest fraction (the electrons) accelerated using all the energy it can provide. Since the ultimate heat sink is 3 K space, the power conversion efficiency can approach 100%; since an electron is very light, they will approach light speed (the non relativistic corrected velocity of an electron at 200 MeV would be over 8 billion m/s). The ions from the fission would simply be dumped to reduce the mass as the trip goes along. This system would approach adding energy from the fission to the kinetic energy of the ship. Even if it was only 10% efficient, the electron stream would STILL be exiting at nearly light speed.","220,635 followers",Franklin Veaux,1.6K,47.3K,783.1M,2018,https://www.quora.com/How-do-spaceships-explode-in-fire-in-Star-Wars-with-no-oxygen

The fusion core emits a large number of fast neutrons, and these neutrons are capable of causing fission in ordinary U-238. So the fusion core in such a bomb is surrounded by U-238, and the induced fission gives about half of the energy. It also gives almost all of the fallout. So in the neutron bomb, this layer is omitted, resulting in much less fallout. The emitted neutrons, which can kill anyone nearby, give the neutron bomb its name.If you are still concerned about what MeV means, it is a unit of energy that is very useful for nuclear reactions.

My former father-in-law also worked at Lawrence Berkeley Labs, and was an engineer designing superconducting coil magnets and had decades of experience working with fusion researchers, even though his primary application was particle accelerators. From having many long conversations with these very intelligent and qualified people I realized that there are some really hard problems that block practical fusion, with no immediate solutions in sight.The only place we know of working, large-scale, energy-generating fusion reactions is at the center of a star, where the gravity of the massive star creates the necessary density, temperature, and time being held in that state at the core for fusion reactions to run continuously. This is called the Lawson criteria, and is hard to achieve. All of the layers of the star above that act as an energy exchanger, converting all the gamma rays and fast neutrons at the core into progressively less energetic wavelengths of light and motion of nuclei (heat) so by the time they reach the surface of the star, that energy is emitted as IR and visible light that heats and powers our planet's biosphere, and can provide photovoltaic energy to us as well. All of our efforts in fusion have been to try and reproduce this process on earth, in a small reactor that can provide practical energy.First I will talk aboutThe first problem with magnetic confinement is fundamental - no matter how strong or well formed the magnetic field containing the plasma is, it will always leak, as positive nuclei or ions spiralling around the magnetic field lines collide and scatter, eventually drifting out of the containment field. The only known solution is to make the reactor larger so the scattering ions take longer to travel to the plasma boundary, and thus more fusion can happen during that time. Pretty brute force.The world's most advanced magnetic confinement fusion power plant is ITER, which, to reduce the ion scattering problem mentioned above, is 6-stories tall and about the same dimension in diameter, containing the mass of 3 Eiffel towers, and it is still not expected to be large enough to contain a plasma long enough to sustain burning and produce continuous energy generation.A more practical problem is how do we extract the energy? Most of the energy in deuterium-tritium fusion reactions is released in fast, high-energy neutrons, which (because they are neutral, and have no electric charge) are not confined by the magnetic field, don't heat up the plasma, and have to be stopped by a thick shield, which then heats up, and can vaporize water to steam in order to power turbines and electrical generators. The problem is the constant bombardment by neutrons makes the shield material degrade with time, and become very radioactive, posing a problem for removal and disposal.Also, deuterium-tritium fusion reactions are currently used because they take place at the lowest energies and at the lowest plasma temperatures of all the possible fusion fuels, and thus are easier to ignite and keep lit. However, tritium is not found naturally in any significant quantities and needs to be manufactured in nuclear reactors. With today's production capacity, we just cannot make enough tritium to power even ITER continuously. We could use better fuels, like Helium-3 or Boron-11, which do not emit neutrons and thus 'burn clean', but the plasma temperature must be much higher and the confinement much better to ignite fusion and sustain it with these fuels. And while Boron-11 is plentiful, Helium-3 is so rare that scientists think that the best source of it is lunar regolith that has been irradiated for billions of years on the moon's surface. Any energy generation infrastructure that requires a regular supply of a moon-based fuel, even as energy dense as He3, will probably never work out.A proposed solution to the Tritium deficit is to construct the shield surrounding the reactor with lithium, which is abundant, and fissions into tritium when struck by neutrons, thereby 'breeding' tritium within the reactor itself. Of course, this comes with its own set of problems of how to capture, purify, and contain the tritium after it is released into the tokamak reaction chamber from the walls.Another issue is that when all of the superconducting magnets in ITER are running at full current (160,000 amps) to create the 13 Tesla toroidal magnetic field (13x that in an MRI machine) and to create the other plasma-shaping and heating fields, they are storing 60 GigaJoules, or around 12 Tons of TNT worth of energy. This is because the 180 kilometers of superconducting Niobium-Tin wires in all these massive magnet coils can carry enormous electrical current when supercooled with liquid helium.More info on the ITER magnets:But, if that cooling fails, the superconductor heats up, quenches, and becomes a normal conductor, and can no longer carry that enormous current. With 160,000 amps suddenly meeting resistance, the coil rapidly vaporizes, and causes a meltdown of the other coils, with a total energy release of 12 tons of TNT. This is very undesirable, especially when those coils are wrapped around a highly radioactive shield that also vaporizes and is expelled into the atmosphere. There are fault-detection systems, but it takes a while to dissipate that amount of energy safely, and there may not be enough time to react quickly enough in the event of a catastrophic magnet coil failure.So, some gotchas left to solve for practical fusion energy generation with magnetic confinement, with some perhaps not so easily solved.Inertial confinement fusionIt also has many of the same problems with energy conversion to electricity, and much worse wear and tear on the shielding from these small nuclear fusion explosions being set off, which also trashes all the precision equipment needed to hold the fuel pellet in the focus of the converging laser beams with extreme accuracy. So, a lot of practical damage control problems before inertial confinement fusion is a practical source of energy generation.While these problems may be solved, practical application is still a very long way off, and currently the main application of inertial confinement fusion is as an experimental testbed for calibrating computer codes used to simulate and design thermonuclear fusion weapons. As horrific as these weapons may be, the simulation codes developed for designing them (sorry maintaining them), are the one of the greatest tools for innovation in fusion energy. There is a hydrodynamics code which simulates the behavior of the fissile (and fusion) materials under extreme conditions of pressure and temperature, as well as transport codes that model neutron transport and scattering in the materials under these conditions, and many other bits and bobs. They are all standard numerical techniques, and the really classified part is the integration and calibration of all these codes with previous nuclear weapon tests from the past, and with these small scale simulations in the present.Electrostatic Confinement FusionBasically you need a vacuum container the size of a basketball and a pump to empty it. You put a small spherical wire cage the size of a golf ball in the center, and a larger wire cage the size of a bowling ball around it. You then pump out all the air, and apply a very large (10,000V) electrical potential between the two cages, with the small negative cathode at the center, and the positive anode at the periphery.Then you open a valve and let in a very small amount of Deuterium gas (commercially available) into the vacuum chamber, and it ionizes in the large voltage potential, the D+ ions in the periphery experience a very strong electric field (100K V/m), and are rapidly accelerated towards the center of the reactor, with enough energy to collide and fuse the deuterium nuclei (no tritium required). This fusion can be measured with an external neutron counter.Theoretically, power generation would be simple, as the fusion products consisting of highly energetic He3 and (few) H3 ions could be decelerated in an electric field and the current from that used to generate electricity directly.Here is ECG Herman’s excellent thesis paper on designing and constructing a Farnsworth Fusor:Although they seem like a obvious winners due to their simplicity and effectiveness, ECF reactors have several things limiting scaling:a) There is a limit to the deuterium gas density before performance degrades, so generation capacity is limited.b) Deuterium ions tend to collide with the wire cage cathode in the center, which absorbs them, heating the cage, and causing energy loss and contamination from metal atoms being dislodged.c) As the deuterium ions oscillate back and forth through the center, each time they change direction, they emit bremsstrahlung radiation, or photons of light, losing energy (this is how your dentist’s x-ray machine works).d) Scattering tends to reduce the nice, radial trajectories of the ions into a Maxwellian distribution over time, reducing the fusion that occurs.There has been work in using electromagnets at the periphery to try and hold a ball of electrons in the center, eliminating the need for a central cage… akaThermonuclear WeaponsIn the Teller-Ulam, two-stage, thermonuclear weapon, a spherical plutonium fission primary (with deuterium-tritium fusion fuel at the core to boost it) is imploded by conventional explosives, the plutonium is crushed far beyond critical density, fissions and detonates. The initial radiation released is contained and focused onto the fusion secondary to implode it, ignite fusion, and detonate it. I just mention this to illustrate the enormous energy needed to really reach the Lawson criteria in a large scale, but nuclear weapons kind of freak me out, so I'm going to refer you to the link to the Wikipedia article about them if you want to read more:Thermonuclear weapon - WikipediaSo, in summary, we should not shut down or stop building today's fission nuclear reactors, as commercial fusion reactors are not only far in the future, but also produce radioactive waste (their shielding, which needs to be periodically replaced), and Tokamaks can melt down catastrophically and explode if there is a cooling failure in the magnet coils during full power operation. They also do not run on seawater, like some say. We need expensive and difficult to produce tritium (which is also radioactive) to ignite fusion at the temperatures and densities that today's tokamak magnetic fields can produce.To advance fusion energy in your career, I think the best fields to study would be physics (classical, electrodynamics, plasma, quantum, nuclear…) and computer science, with a focus on numerical simulation. The actual physical fusion reactors are so expensive and time-consuming to build, test, and operate, that you may only get to iterate designs once or twice in a career, but computer simulations can take us in so many different directions more cheaply and easily by comparison.Perhaps there is some exotic stellarator magnetic confinement design, or advanced Farnsworth electrostatic confinement design that has not been explored in depth, that will turn out to hold the key to fusion energy. Simulation is probably the best first step to find it, unless you have a few billion dollars and several hundred kilometers of Niobium-Tin wire and helium cooling tubing to play with.Brent","3,658 followers",Brent Oster,3.6K,357,1.8M,2021,https://www.quora.com/How-do-spaceships-explode-in-fire-in-Star-Wars-with-no-oxygen

That’s what you get when you lump enough mass to make more than 300,000 Earths.We obviously do not have 300,000 spare Earths to play with, and it would not be very practical either. So we cannot use gravitational confinement. We are trying to use other means to confine the fusion fuel for sustained fusion.And we aren’t simply trying to mimic the Sun. We want to do better. After all, for a practical fusion power generating station, we want to be able to produce a lot more power, perhaps up to a few hundred megawatts of raw thermal power per cubic meter inside the reactor. So we are trying to best the Sun by a factor of a million, give or take.That is hard. That is, if I may use somewhat unprofessional language, damn hard.

The company consists of two key people: a plasma thruster expert and an audacious internet entrepreneur. Both are pictured below [2,4]. The entrepreneur is Mike Cassidy.Mr. Cassidy is a big deal. His name alone, makes this company one to watch. Most recently, Cassidy served as an executive director, at Google. He has lead and sold off multiple companies since starting in business in early nineties [5]. In a word: he is a classic Silicon Valley entrepreneur. The man is also well connected: Tech Crunch has reported that Larry Page and Sergey Brin of Google are both “super enthusiastic” about this startup [1]. The other person involved is Dr. Ben Longmier. Dr. Longmier is currently an adjunct professor of aerospace engineering at the University of Michigan [4]. He has worked extensively, in plasma thrusters.Until April fourth 2017, I had never heard of either of these guys. They both work in different fields from traditional fusion. Whatever, we need them. The quest for fusion power needs all the help it can get.I was able to get a hold of Apollo Fusions’ patent application [7]. It was filed on September first of 2015. I would guess that Dr. Longmier spearheaded this effort - and brought Mike Cassidy in later. The companies’ approach is based on plasma thruster research. Their concept reminds me most of a virtual cathode made inside a penning trap. That idea was originally suggested by Dan Barnes, of the Los Alamos National Labs, back in 2000 [23]. In any case, the gist of it is: get a lot of electrons together and have them attract ions towards one spot. Get them moving at high enough speeds to create fusion. That sounds a lot like a polywell.Dr. Longmier is lucky to work in plasma thruster research. Indeed, they may be better understood that traditional fusion devices. Thrusters have gotten the funding, while our fusion field has languished. Your basic thruster relies on the Hall Effect. This is a well-researched topic, with it’s’ roots back into the sixties [7]. Multiple research teams have been involved in this effort, over the past five decades and Hall Thrusters have been used to circle the moon [6].A Basic Thruster:How do plasma thrusters work? They are normally tested in low pressure vacuum environment (1.3E-3 to 1.3E-6 Pascal). In the past, these thrusters sat on large satellites, but there has been a recent push into smaller, cube stats. A cube stat is a hunk of metal, 10 centimeters to a side. They represent the next generation of satellites. This change is reflected in Dr. Longmiers’ research. On paper, he is part of the University of Michigans’ Plasmadynamics and Electric Propulsion lab. That lab was founded in 1992 and since then, has hosted 15 or 20 big thruster experiments [9]. They were all housed inside a vast, 200 cubic meter, tank. These represent the old kind of thrusters. Dr. Longmier has pushed into smaller sizes [24]. He has focusing on cube stats. The basic mechanism of a Hall thruster is shown below [8, 6].To build a hall thruster, the first thing you need to do is set up your fields. At the center of the thruster is a ringed cavity. This is filled with both a magnetic and electric field. These fields run perpendicular, to one another. The magnetic field comes out from the center, while the electric field points out from the bottom of the cavity. The Lorentz force dictates electrons inside this cavity will mostly stay there. Once set up, you need to light your thruster. To do that, you must inject a fuel. Xenon is the most common fuel to burn. This is because it is a big fat atom that is easy to ionize. The Xenon atoms interact with the electrons and ionize. Once positive, they fly away from the positive electric field. When they leave this cavity they accelerate, pushing the satellite forward. As they fly, they suck in electrons which neutralize the beam. This makes a broad, neutral jet, pushing the satellite forward.Comparing:The biggest differences between this kind of work and traditional fusion research - is the scale of everything. For example, the magnetic fields used inside a hall thruster will only reach a few hundred guass [10]. Meanwhile, a polywell will need a field that is 80 times higher [11]. These are the kind of fundamental differences, which change everything about how you do your testing. For example, a Hall thruster could be run for several minutes, powered by batteries or the wall outlet. In stark contrast, the Lockheed fusion reactor must run off capacitors. Hence, Lockheed can only fire their machine for a few microseconds [12-14]. Another difference is the plasma temperature. Thruster plasma is tens of electronvolts, aka very cold. A typical fusor does fusion at 30,000 eletronvolts or hotter [15, 16]. That difference is stark, and it effects everything about how the plasma behaves. Finally, the fuels are very different. Xenon is easy to use. It is a noble gas, which works well in a vacuum system. Vacuum experts will tell you, you need a noble gas to push out the air in a Vacuum [26]. A fusion fuel like tritium is very different. When we worked with it at the Laboratory for Laser Energetics, it was a cost, regulatory and safety hassle. If Apollo Fusion wants to burn tritium, they will need a great deal more technical staff and costs.All this being said, Dr. Longmier has a history of pushing the bounds of technology. He was part of a team that developed a 200 kilowatt rocket engine at the Ad Astra Rocket Company, in Houston [18]. As I understand it, this is an order of magnitude better than other rocket thrusters. This company is widely known in the space community, because of its’ CEO, Dr. Franklin Chang Díaz. Reaching such a high thrust means that many other plasma parameters and field strengths should rise in kind. But here is the key question: would plasmas in rockets get so good that they could start to look like fusion plasmas?The Patent:Patents are always vague. At first glance, this concept looks like: an electron jet, inside some bigger fields. At its’ core, is an electron beam. This beam runs right through the center of the machine. The idea is to get the electrons in this beam to bunch together. This, in turn, will attract the ions for fusion reactions. The patent does not mention how they plan to make this electron beam. But, they will need some solution here. If the electrons are not shoved forward with enough kick, they will be scattered by the other fields inside this machine. Fortunately, there are several off the-shelf electron beams that they can buy [19]. Once shot forward, the electrons will encounter several other fields simultaneously.Normally, I would model these fields, as I have in the past for the polywell and Lockheeds’ CFR [20, 21]. A model is very straightforward. You use excel, newtons’ equations of motions and the Lorentz force to map out how the electrons move around. If you want to get fancy, you use MATLAB or COMSOL. Regrettably, this patent gives us no hint as to the field strengths or dimensions inside this machine. The picture that they do give, is reproduced below [7].This is a very busy picture. The first thing you notice the large green field on the outside. This is supposed to be a balanced magnetic field. Ideally, this opposes the electron beam [7]. The patent promises that this magnetic should slow the electron leakage to the ring in the center. The next thing that you notice is that big red ring. That is just one big, positive voltage ring. A positive lump metal, for which the design is not finalized. The patent, in fact, covers several ring designs. The patent claims that if you pulse a voltaage on this ring, you can increase the plasma density in the electron beam by 700 fold. Where is this claim coming from? It be must from one of Dr. Longmiers’ publications.The center of that ring, is where the magic happens. This increase in beam density is suppose to pull ions in towards the center. If everything works as planned, the ions will slam together and fuse. This will generate neutrons, which will fly away and hit the walls. The patent then talks about using FLiBe, in the walls, to absorb the neutrons. FLibe is a popular molten salt which has been pushed the thorium community [22]. This would represent a fusion-fission hybrid approach.Assessment:Obviously, this patent and Apollos’ website will not reveal how far along this research is. Since the patent was filed in 2015, it is safe to say that Longmier has been looking at this problem for some years. That said, he has a full time job, so he does not have infinite time to develop the idea. This concept is similar to many other fusion devices – it looks like a tuning problem. You have several parameters that you can adjust. These include, but are not limited to: the fuel injection rate, the shape of the electrode, the vacuum pressure (1E-5 to 1E-10 torr), both the field strengths and their positions. You can also change the beam characteristics and how everything is placed in the machine. As you adjust these parameters, you toggle between affects that youCitations:1. Heater, Brian.

The blanket will breed plutonium (or U233 if the thorium fans would prefer) and regardless will generate heat. The fission blanket is kept subcritical so that one does not need complicated control or safety systems - at least that is the claim. Since each DT reaction will generate one or more fissions, one generates 15 or more times as much heat for each DT reaction making break even easier.Going back in time again, the joke was that if you made the fusion part of your hybrid plant vanishingly small, you would have a practical power plant.","220,634 followers",Franklin Veaux,550,47.3K,783.1M,2017,https://www.quora.com/How-do-spaceships-explode-in-fire-in-Star-Wars-with-no-oxygen

My former father-in-law also worked at Lawrence Berkeley Labs, and was an engineer designing superconducting coil magnets and had decades of experience working with fusion researchers, even though his primary application was particle accelerators. From having many long conversations with these very intelligent and qualified people I realized that there are some really hard problems that block practical fusion, with no immediate solutions in sight.The only place we know of working, large-scale, energy-generating fusion reactions is at the center of a star, where the gravity of the massive star creates the necessary density, temperature, and time being held in that state at the core for fusion reactions to run continuously. This is called the Lawson criteria, and is hard to achieve. All of the layers of the star above that act as an energy exchanger, converting all the gamma rays and fast neutrons at the core into progressively less energetic wavelengths of light and motion of nuclei (heat) so by the time they reach the surface of the star, that energy is emitted as IR and visible light that heats and powers our planet's biosphere, and can provide photovoltaic energy to us as well. All of our efforts in fusion have been to try and reproduce this process on earth, in a small reactor that can provide practical energy.First I will talk aboutThe first problem with magnetic confinement is fundamental - no matter how strong or well formed the magnetic field containing the plasma is, it will always leak, as positive nuclei or ions spiralling around the magnetic field lines collide and scatter, eventually drifting out of the containment field. The only known solution is to make the reactor larger so the scattering ions take longer to travel to the plasma boundary, and thus more fusion can happen during that time. Pretty brute force.The world's most advanced magnetic confinement fusion power plant is ITER, which, to reduce the ion scattering problem mentioned above, is 6-stories tall and about the same dimension in diameter, containing the mass of 3 Eiffel towers, and it is still not expected to be large enough to contain a plasma long enough to sustain burning and produce continuous energy generation.A more practical problem is how do we extract the energy? Most of the energy in deuterium-tritium fusion reactions is released in fast, high-energy neutrons, which (because they are neutral, and have no electric charge) are not confined by the magnetic field, don't heat up the plasma, and have to be stopped by a thick shield, which then heats up, and can vaporize water to steam in order to power turbines and electrical generators. The problem is the constant bombardment by neutrons makes the shield material degrade with time, and become very radioactive, posing a problem for removal and disposal.Also, deuterium-tritium fusion reactions are currently used because they take place at the lowest energies and at the lowest plasma temperatures of all the possible fusion fuels, and thus are easier to ignite and keep lit. However, tritium is not found naturally in any significant quantities and needs to be manufactured in nuclear reactors. With today's production capacity, we just cannot make enough tritium to power even ITER continuously. We could use better fuels, like Helium-3 or Boron-11, which do not emit neutrons and thus 'burn clean', but the plasma temperature must be much higher and the confinement much better to ignite fusion and sustain it with these fuels. And while Boron-11 is plentiful, Helium-3 is so rare that scientists think that the best source of it is lunar regolith that has been irradiated for billions of years on the moon's surface. Any energy generation infrastructure that requires a regular supply of a moon-based fuel, even as energy dense as He3, will probably never work out.A proposed solution to the Tritium deficit is to construct the shield surrounding the reactor with lithium, which is abundant, and fissions into tritium when struck by neutrons, thereby 'breeding' tritium within the reactor itself. Of course, this comes with its own set of problems of how to capture, purify, and contain the tritium after it is released into the tokamak reaction chamber from the walls.Another issue is that when all of the superconducting magnets in ITER are running at full current (160,000 amps) to create the 13 Tesla toroidal magnetic field (13x that in an MRI machine) and to create the other plasma-shaping and heating fields, they are storing 60 GigaJoules, or around 12 Tons of TNT worth of energy. This is because the 180 kilometers of superconducting Niobium-Tin wires in all these massive magnet coils can carry enormous electrical current when supercooled with liquid helium.More info on the ITER magnets:But, if that cooling fails, the superconductor heats up, quenches, and becomes a normal conductor, and can no longer carry that enormous current. With 160,000 amps suddenly meeting resistance, the coil rapidly vaporizes, and causes a meltdown of the other coils, with a total energy release of 12 tons of TNT. This is very undesirable, especially when those coils are wrapped around a highly radioactive shield that also vaporizes and is expelled into the atmosphere. There are fault-detection systems, but it takes a while to dissipate that amount of energy safely, and there may not be enough time to react quickly enough in the event of a catastrophic magnet coil failure.So, some gotchas left to solve for practical fusion energy generation with magnetic confinement, with some perhaps not so easily solved.Inertial confinement fusionIt also has many of the same problems with energy conversion to electricity, and much worse wear and tear on the shielding from these small nuclear fusion explosions being set off, which also trashes all the precision equipment needed to hold the fuel pellet in the focus of the converging laser beams with extreme accuracy. So, a lot of practical damage control problems before inertial confinement fusion is a practical source of energy generation.While these problems may be solved, practical application is still a very long way off, and currently the main application of inertial confinement fusion is as an experimental testbed for calibrating computer codes used to simulate and design thermonuclear fusion weapons. As horrific as these weapons may be, the simulation codes developed for designing them (sorry maintaining them), are the one of the greatest tools for innovation in fusion energy. There is a hydrodynamics code which simulates the behavior of the fissile (and fusion) materials under extreme conditions of pressure and temperature, as well as transport codes that model neutron transport and scattering in the materials under these conditions, and many other bits and bobs. They are all standard numerical techniques, and the really classified part is the integration and calibration of all these codes with previous nuclear weapon tests from the past, and with these small scale simulations in the present.Electrostatic Confinement FusionBasically you need a vacuum container the size of a basketball and a pump to empty it. You put a small spherical wire cage the size of a golf ball in the center, and a larger wire cage the size of a bowling ball around it. You then pump out all the air, and apply a very large (10,000V) electrical potential between the two cages, with the small negative cathode at the center, and the positive anode at the periphery.Then you open a valve and let in a very small amount of Deuterium gas (commercially available) into the vacuum chamber, and it ionizes in the large voltage potential, the D+ ions in the periphery experience a very strong electric field (100K V/m), and are rapidly accelerated towards the center of the reactor, with enough energy to collide and fuse the deuterium nuclei (no tritium required). This fusion can be measured with an external neutron counter.Theoretically, power generation would be simple, as the fusion products consisting of highly energetic He3 and (few) H3 ions could be decelerated in an electric field and the current from that used to generate electricity directly.Here is ECG Herman’s excellent thesis paper on designing and constructing a Farnsworth Fusor:Although they seem like a obvious winners due to their simplicity and effectiveness, ECF reactors have several things limiting scaling:a) There is a limit to the deuterium gas density before performance degrades, so generation capacity is limited.b) Deuterium ions tend to collide with the wire cage cathode in the center, which absorbs them, heating the cage, and causing energy loss and contamination from metal atoms being dislodged.c) As the deuterium ions oscillate back and forth through the center, each time they change direction, they emit bremsstrahlung radiation, or photons of light, losing energy (this is how your dentist’s x-ray machine works).d) Scattering tends to reduce the nice, radial trajectories of the ions into a Maxwellian distribution over time, reducing the fusion that occurs.There has been work in using electromagnets at the periphery to try and hold a ball of electrons in the center, eliminating the need for a central cage… akaThermonuclear WeaponsIn the Teller-Ulam, two-stage, thermonuclear weapon, a spherical plutonium fission primary (with deuterium-tritium fusion fuel at the core to boost it) is imploded by conventional explosives, the plutonium is crushed far beyond critical density, fissions and detonates. The initial radiation released is contained and focused onto the fusion secondary to implode it, ignite fusion, and detonate it. I just mention this to illustrate the enormous energy needed to really reach the Lawson criteria in a large scale, but nuclear weapons kind of freak me out, so I'm going to refer you to the link to the Wikipedia article about them if you want to read more:Thermonuclear weapon - WikipediaSo, in summary, we should not shut down or stop building today's fission nuclear reactors, as commercial fusion reactors are not only far in the future, but also produce radioactive waste (their shielding, which needs to be periodically replaced), and Tokamaks can melt down catastrophically and explode if there is a cooling failure in the magnet coils during full power operation. They also do not run on seawater, like some say. We need expensive and difficult to produce tritium (which is also radioactive) to ignite fusion at the temperatures and densities that today's tokamak magnetic fields can produce.To advance fusion energy in your career, I think the best fields to study would be physics (classical, electrodynamics, plasma, quantum, nuclear…) and computer science, with a focus on numerical simulation. The actual physical fusion reactors are so expensive and time-consuming to build, test, and operate, that you may only get to iterate designs once or twice in a career, but computer simulations can take us in so many different directions more cheaply and easily by comparison.Perhaps there is some exotic stellarator magnetic confinement design, or advanced Farnsworth electrostatic confinement design that has not been explored in depth, that will turn out to hold the key to fusion energy. Simulation is probably the best first step to find it, unless you have a few billion dollars and several hundred kilometers of Niobium-Tin wire and helium cooling tubing to play with.Brent",457 followers,Jason Heinisch,1K,1.2K,2.2M,2021,https://www.quora.com/How-do-spaceships-explode-in-fire-in-Star-Wars-with-no-oxygen

That is problem number one. The second problem is that a plasma now is filled with charged particles that have, you guessed it, their own little magnetic fields. This means that they mess with the other ions in unpredictable and unwanted ways. This lack of uniformity means that you need to have bigger and more expensive magnets to push them back in line and behave.
