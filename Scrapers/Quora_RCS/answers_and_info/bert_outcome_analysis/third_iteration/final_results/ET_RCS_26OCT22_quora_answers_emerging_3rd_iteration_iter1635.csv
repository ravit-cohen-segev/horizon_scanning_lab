If I should guess what 300 years from now will be, I’m sorry, but all I can picture isArtificial Intelligence will be perfected by 300 years from now, with robots being able to detect that humans are killing their planet (Maybe). I should also mention that AI perfection will be the greatest technological achievement. That is where AI can not only think for itself, but also able to execute those thoughts. And they will also become autonomous to even write codes to create other robots.Humanity might become extinctI’ve watched movies about how robots turned on humans.

Once we make non-polluting power generation a reality, so much more becomes available.Of course, the above is only true if they can never perfect my first love, the ability to ECONOMICALLY negate gravity on a local basis. THAT would be the game changer of all time. It is easy enough to defeat gravity if we are willing/able to throw unlimited energy at the problem. What I want is the ability to fly, so to speak, either a few feet or to the stars. Right now, it just costs too much to lift any meaningful amount of mass above the Earth. By meaningful, I mean enough to build starships or to make Moon and Mars colonies a reality.

When I heard the doctor tell her “six months”, it felt likeI met my wife, Jess, twenty-one years ago when she was nineteen.Our parents owned side-by-side cabins in the northern part of New York and we both happened to be along for the week-long hunting trip our fathers planned that year.Jess' father was a skilled hunter and could hit a headshot from a mile away — same as my dad.Jess and I didn't hunt with them — we hung out by the lake.The moment I saw Jess I fell in love. We've been together ever since.But now, now that she has an expiration date, I just don't know what to do — I'm scared and lost.Monday morning at work I was telling my best friend and supervisor, Timmy, about my wife's condition. Timmy told me that I.T. or Intelligent Terrestrial just came out with their latest models.These models are different than those of yesteryear because they are 52% mechanical and 48% biological.Timmy said all you have to do is mail a sample of DNA to I.T. and upload a digital copy of your consciousness through an app. You can then purchase a custom made clone at an age of your choice. When the clone arrives it will turn on, study it's surroundings and await a consciousness download.“Oh my God Timmy, what's the catch?”“The price, Leon.”When I got home from work, Jess and I plugged in and uploaded a digital copy of our entire conscious catalog to I.T. and then mailed off DNA samples.Jess asked me what age I wanted her to be. It felt awkward to say “twenty”, but I did it — I was honest. I miss her smooth, youthful skin and I want her to be young and healthy — especially if I have to cash my entire 401K in to afford it.We told her parents that we were going to basically bring her back from the dead and her father threatened to shoot any abomination that we brought into this world.One month later, on a day that Jess was particularly ill, the doorbell rang.Jess and I dragged the box through the door and laid it on the living room floor. I gently cut along the lines and when I opened the flaps, there,she,was.The last time my heart fluttered like this was the day I met her.Jess helped me lift I.T. out of the box and sit I.T. up.I.T. was warm and soft. I.T. was mine. I paid for I.T. I own I.T.Machines like this don't have rights — even though they are part biological, the governments recognize them in the same way they would a lawnmower — so, as I said, I.T. is my possession.The science behind uploading a digital consciousness is so cutting edge, that the laws just haven't caught up yet.Jess turned I.T. on and I.T. looked right into my eyes. I was in love — with two women, but, it was the same woman. We hadn't uploaded Jess' consciousness yet, so, I.T. was running on basic programming, but I.T. was gorgeous.Jess asked me what I wanted to do, and for the first time in a very long time — I lied to her.I told her we should go shopping and buy I.T. some clothes.I.T. doesn't seem to have a personality yet.“Hello…. Smile…”Jess picked outfits for both of them and we went for a walk through the park together. It was amazing — I was so happy.We walked down a cozy little trail and found a tuck away to sit and talk.I.T. watched and studied every move Jess and I made. I.T. was learning and adapting.I.T. was becoming aware.At one point Jess and I got distracted and I.T. wandered off. When we found I.T., I.T. was gazing at the sky.I asked I.T. what it was doing. I.T. said, “Where do I come from?”“You come from Heaven. You are my angel.”That answer seemed to work for I.T. We all walked back to the car and headed home.When we got home, Jess immediately started coughing. She fell to the ground and I tried to help her, but I didn't know what to do.Jess passed away right then. It was finally over.I called her family and the police. It took an hour for them to remove the body. I had Jess 2.0 sitting in my back room waiting for them to leave.After the police left, I plugged I.T. into my laptop and downloaded Jess' consciousness.After the download was complete, we walked outside and I looked into her gigantic brown eyes. I asked her, “Is it you, Jess?”She smiled and said, “It is, silly — now kiss me.”Her head slammed back. I didn't know if she was glitching or what and then I heard a bang and saw a hole above her left eye.My beautiful Jessica died twice today. I was crushed.Over the next two decades, I fell into a deep, dark, alcohol-fueled depression. Although I had developed a serious alcohol problem, I was able to work and save every single penny I earned.After twenty years of saving, I decided I wanted both of them back — the twenty-year-old Jess and the forty-year-old Jess.I sent my entire life savings off to I.T. and in one month, my doorbell rang.I cut the box open and wept when I saw my angel(s).I turned them on.I also clothed them. The younger version of me may have left them in the nude, but at this age, I just want my companion(s) back.The ladies helped me back to my room to lay down. I was so tired from all the excitement.I've waited and worked an entire lifetime to be with the woman I love. And now, at long last — she is beside me.I died, on that very night as a happy man.One day later, the doorbell rang. It seems my beautiful Jessicas used my direct deposit life insurance benefit to make a purchase.They gently cut the box open.And turned me on.You ask where technology will be in 2050?We will be everywhere.LeonSpecial thanks:Cameron — Dear friend. Thank you so much for all your help with bringing this idea to life. You are awesome. I'm proud to call you friend.Kinsalynn — My sister and friend.

It’s actually obvious because death caused by ‘wearing out’ would be subject to an exponential decay curve and have a detectable ‘half life’ instead of hitting a wall at about age 120.One example of an animal whose lifespan DOES have a ‘half life’ is the naked mole rat. While most rats tend to live about 3 years, naked mole rats that survive childhood will have an equal probability of dying thereafter. (One researcher noticed that one of the worker rats she was studying was over thirty years old.) BUT these rats are eusocial non-breeders so their immortality does NOT affect evolution of the species. (I have seen no information on the longevity of the breeding queens.)My point is that the easiest route to life extension is to remove the genetic time bomb that causes abrupt aging through genetic engineering.","115,120 followers",Daveed Phoenix,8.1K,9.9K,160.6M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-main-advancements-in-technology-can-I-expect-in-the-next-100-years

The average life span has increased in the last century by decreasing the number of deaths by infection. Vaccines still work, but the success of antibiotics is waning.

If you’re like most people, you will know very little, if anything at all, about those men. They are dead. The people who knew them are dead. That’s what will happen to you. That’s what will happen to me.Is it sad? Maybe.

We’ve been making great strides lately with 3D-printed materials so we can make prosthetic arms that are exactly the right size for the wearer.I would sure like somebody to find a treatment that cures presbyopia, the loss of muscle strength in the eyes that forces people to get reading glasses in middle age.

Before I continue, I want you to meet theWhat does that say to you? Couldn’t she be the height of technology as we know it?Making her a citizen makes me think about the motive behind AI and the direction technology is going.The world is advancing to where technology will become autonomous. Which means humans are not required anymore. Almost like we are being replaced, right? What if that’s t300 years from now? Well, be glad You and I won’t be alive by then.

Which means humans are not required anymore. Almost like we are being replaced, right? What if that’s the case?Autonomous vehicles, machines, etc..You will agree with me that 300 years from now is more than enough to perfect Artificial Intelligence.Oh…are you hoping I will tell you about IoTThe World’s First Artificial Intelligence robot citizen “Sophia” may be a kind of ‘Adam’ for the robot generation.Also, with the advancement in technology, comes with a lot of negative effects as well. If I should guess what 300 years from now will be, I’m sorry, but all I can picture isArtificial Intelligence will be perfected by 300 years from now, with robots being able to detect that humans are killing their planet (Maybe). I should also mention that AI perfection will be the greatest technological achievement. That is where AI can not only think for itself, but also able to execute those thoughts. And they will also become autonomous to even write codes to create other robots.Humanity might become extinctI’ve watched movies about how robots turned on humans. But now I feel these movies are trying to pass a message.Watch the moviesIn conclusion, If you ask about technology in 5 to 30 years from now, I might mention some gadgets and stuff… but 300 years from now, this is what you get.",17 followers,Fabius Fairchild,1.8K,0,0,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-main-advancements-in-technology-can-I-expect-in-the-next-100-years
