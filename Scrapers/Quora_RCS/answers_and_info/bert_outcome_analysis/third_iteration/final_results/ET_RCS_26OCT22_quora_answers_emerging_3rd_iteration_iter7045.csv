Company Mission (what do they want to be when they grow up). Company Strategy (what game are they playing and how do they plan to win that game). What skillsets does the company have and what do they need.  How will the team makeup evolve over time.. Values and culture.  Do they value collaboration?  Transparency?  Work/life balance?  Do they want ""thinkers"" or ""doers""?. What does a typical week look like?  Meetings?  Hours?  Productive or reactive to the latest crises?. How much money has the company raised, shares outstanding, most recent common stock valuation (option strike price).  Ask this one later in the process when the offer has been made, but they absolutely should answer it unless they are trying to hire naive folks.Remember, you are interviewing them as much as they are interviewing you, so ask questions aggressively throughout, and beware companies who don't expect you to or don't expect to answer.",818 followers,Sumeet Raj Thakker,32.2K,0,0,2010,https://www.quora.com/What-is-blockchain-technology-and-which-are-the-best-blockchain-development-companies-in-the-USA

It's also harder to interoperate with non-Java stuff. Scala had a lot of the downsides of Java and the JVM, although it wasn't quite as bad. The language seemed a little too new and like it would bring some unnecessary risk (for example, who knows how good support will be in 10 years).Two other languages we very briefly thought about were OCaml and Haskell (neither had big enough ecosystems or good enough standard libraries, and both were potentially too hard for some designers/data analysts/non-engineers who might need to write code).We decided that Python was fast enough for most of what we need to do (since we push our performance-critical code to backend servers written in C++ whenever possible). As far as typechecking, we ended up writing very thorough unit tests which are worth writing anyway, and achieve most of the same goals. We also had a lot of confidence that Python would continue to evolve in a direction that would be good for the life of our codebase, having watched it evolve over the last 5 years.So far, we've been pretty happy with the choice. There's a small selection bias, but all of the early employees who'd been working with other languages in the past were happy to transition to Python, especially those coming from PHP.

One of the answers said, “not wanting to be on Microsoft’s stack” but again as I mentioned Python uses C libraries.Both sides seem to be biased on which one is better but from mentioning the fact of needing C libraries to stay just as fast, the fact most Python programs are used on companies that can afford to feed investor money in, and not really worry with using more server space.I don’t remember which articles brought up the said problems with Python in that department in particular if I’m honest. So by all means I’d rather fact check this part than take my memory for it.Python is an object based language while PHP is a server side scripting language;Again both have their uses, and comparing the two it’d seem PHP is the better choice, however on the lower end stuff or resource cheap side Python isn’t a bad choice.Overall for Qoura it’d make sense to use Python even if I disagree with it, whatever makes them more money.

Neither will the Java complaints ever end - but in the mean time, Java will go ahead and keep getting people hired all around the world, and running a lot of the finance sector - yet, they’ll keep complaining about it.They might hate C++, yet, most of the most significant and hard-hitting software has some C++ in it - Photoshop, Chrome, Windows, Maya, 3DS Max, Microsoft Word…A lot of people have given their comments (After Adam and Charlie’s comments), and sound something like…Python this, python that…but they seem not to consider….Ultimately, ITechnology is a means to an end. It’s not an end in itself.Facebook is written in what everybody calls ‘less than ideal PHP’, yet, has it stopped Facebook from being in the top 3 most popular and visited sites in the world? Because the ideas behind Facebook are more important than the tech stack.","56,375 followers",Charlie Cheever,5.9K,1.5K,9.4M,2018,https://www.quora.com/As-a-software-developer-candidate-at-a-technology-startup-what-kind-of-questions-can-I-ask-the-interviewer

24,"Facebook still sticking around with PHP more than a decade into the projectBut the propaganda among some programmers is that if you paint mad on PHP and mention it’s limitations, which you can’t even prove yourself, then you sound like a classy and experienced programmer.Well, away from the truth.It is much easier and faster to program in PHP than in anything else.And that’s another reasons some guys don’t find it interesting because they’d rather goof away their time cracking hard stuff than get down to businesFacebook still sticking around with PHP more than a decade into the projectBut the propaganda among some programmers is that if you paint mad on PHP and mention it’s limitations, which you can’t even prove yourself, then you sound like a classy and experienced programmer.Well, away from the truth.It is much easier and faster to program in PHP than in anything else.And that’s another reasons some guys don’t find it interesting because they’d rather goof away their time cracking hard stuff than get down to business and get some work done.So they’d weigh their options with Python or Ruby.I don’t agree whenSecondly Facebook have all the money in the world to re-write the whole codebase in a more sexy language if they wanted to.But the thing is, they have found out that PHP gets the job done, and all they wanted they got in PHP.

26,Well... because founders didn't want to learn legacy languages like C / Perl etc. Perl could have been better choice next to C as far as CGI applications are concerned. Python is much slower in this daemon. Compiled C codes integrated as bytecode in Perl XS is even faster than Compiled C or interpreted Perl5.After all it's a choice. Generally popular websites' software stack become idol for newcomers and that's is the biggest misconfiguration of developers' mind!,661 followers,Vaibhav Kaushal,1K,786,2.2M,2015,https://www.quora.com/As-a-software-developer-candidate-at-a-technology-startup-what-kind-of-questions-can-I-ask-the-interviewer
