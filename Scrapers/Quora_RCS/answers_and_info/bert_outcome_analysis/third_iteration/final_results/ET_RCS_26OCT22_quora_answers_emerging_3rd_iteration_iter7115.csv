I was thinking of the same thing while reading through Quora on modern armoured warfare. Before I mention anything else, you should read this link below.The Evolution Of Modern Chinese TanksSo if you didn’t, here’s a brief reason of why.China’s cultural revolution went into excesses. It damaged both the industries, and killed off the intelligensia. Where science and development is concerned, that shameful episode in their history threw the country back into the stone age. Political differences also ended tank development and sales with the Soviet Union.It took them the better part of two decades to restart meaningful armoured development. Earlier tanks were basically clones of Russian models with superficial improvements. Also recall that the Cultural Revolution killed off a lot of smart and educated people. It would take two decades before you have a steady cadre of smart people working on armour development again.Type 69Above: Type 69, an improvement upon the Type 59 (clone of the T-54A). Most improvements were superficial. By 1970, other nation tanks of the era were NBC proof but the Type 69 wasn’tBy the 80’s the Chinese finally had the Type-85 & 88 (Type-88Above: Type 88 using the Soviet style cast steel turret sporting a Type-83 105 mm rifled gun.Type 85IIMAbove: New welded turret design, this model mounts a 125mm gun and autoloaderType 85 IIAbove: Type 85 with the original 105mm dual-axis stabilised gunHowever, having access to captured Russian T-72s from Iran (taken during the Iran-Iraq war), the Chinese realised that the Russian 125mm gun would easily penetrate the Type 85/88 armour despite the latter’s more accurate gun at longer ranges. Development and production stopped on the Type 80 family. Unfortunately, a UN embargo on China also halted their cooperation with other countries.The 90’s and the economic windfall meant China now have access to funds for development and purchase of foreign technology along with an established cadre of tank developers. We would later on see Norinco roll out the modern Type-96, their first genuine third generation MBT.Type 96Above: Type 96 was China’s true 3rd gen tank. It is powered by a 760hp diesel engine that critics claimed was insufficient. However, at one-third the price of the larger and more expensive Type 99, the army is able to field much more of them. It is also the base system for the Pakistani Al-Khalid tank.The Type 96B was introduced to address the short comings of the earlier Type 96.The Type 96B－compared with its predecessors in the Type 96 family－has a high-performance 125 mm smooth bore gun, an improved, more powerful 1000hp engine, newly developed transmission gear and a state-of-the-art fire-control system.Type 99Above: Type 99 series is the most advance MBT in the PLA today. Powered by a 1,500hp diesel engine, the tank's welded turret is of an angular design with spaced modular armor and composite panels. The frontal protection is comparable to the Russian T-90 and Western tanks. Future models may incorporate 3rd gen ERA that can defeat penetrator rods.“The latest model is called Type 99A2, which has been around for a few years, equipped numbers are said to be 200+”The main gun of the Type 99 is the ZPT- 98, a 125mm version of the BWK120 120mm gun mounted on theCredit where credit is due, the Chinese did produce a licensed copy of the 2A46 for theirIn effect what we are looking at are a series of starts and stops in the development of indigenous armoured fighting vehicles in China.After WW2, Japan became an ally of the Americans. With that came the benefit of access to technology. While the early Japanese Tanks (In several ways, their continuous tank development mirrored their US and South Korean counterparts.JGSDF Type 61Above: The type 61 sported a 90mm gun. At 35 tons it was light for a tank and was intended more as a gun carriage to hold mountain passes.JGSDF Type 74Above: The Japanese contemporary to the German Leopard 1, it featured extensive sloping armour to defeat kinetic rounds.JGSDF Type 90Above: Designed to face T-72s and Chinese tanks, the Type 90 sported a smoothbore 120mm L44 license built Rheinmetall gun. Its heavy weight made it suitable for crossing only 60% of the bridges in the country.JGSDF Type 10Above: Type 10. The latest entry into the JGSDF armour asset. At 44 tons (actually 48 tons) it is lighter than the older Type 90, enabling it to cross 90% of the bridges in Japan. Heavy emphasis was placed on C4I capabilities as well as on performance, firepower, protection and mobility.The Type 10’s new Nano-Crystal steel and ceramic composites is similar to IBD Deisenroth Engineering’s AMAP (modular armour) which is mounted on the Leopard 2 Evolution giving it twice as much protection against modern 125mm rounds than traditional armoured steel without significant additional weight penalties.Its C4I package (allowing it to work with cross service platforms) will give the Type 10 battalion an upper hand over its adversaries.I think the best way to describe why Japan was ahead of the Chinese is summed up by a statement made by a former General Dynamics senior executive who retired into teaching at Wharton. He said that one of the reasons the US has such long developmental time and cycle for weapon systems, has to do with validity of knowledge and retaining the know-how of building it.The US has so many carriers and is the only country who still knows how to build and run a CVBG. Similarly Japan had a continual process although some of their armoured development faced difficulties.This kept the knowledge from disappearing. The Chinese because of their start and stop development ran into difficulties trying to catch up with the Japanese, although now they are not very far behind.What’s next for the Chinese?MBT3000 (VT-4), entirely for export and technology collaboration.Above: VT-4. This 4th gen tank has a fully digital fire control system and has a battle management system.The VT-4 has an advanced fire-control instrument, a new-type active protection system and a state-of-the-art, fully automatic transmission device. In addition, the inter-unit network connects commanders of tanks and armored vehicles under a combat group, enabling them to share battlefield data in a real-time manner.Rear view of VT-4Its large rear reveals a large diesel powerpack (1,300 hp), something that cannot be squeezed into the dimunitive Type 96.Already, Thailand and Pakistan have requested tanks for trials to replace their fleet of older tanks.Update: 11th Nov 2016A new type of 125mm gun, the world’s fastest.A new gun was unveiled by the Chinese news and just as quickly it was scrubbed from the internet.This new 125/L60 gun reportedly has a muzzle velocity of 2000m/s. It is much larger than the previous guns on the Type-96 and Type-99. The current Type 96 and 99 uses two piece ammunition on their autoloader due to size restrictions, in turn allowing a smaller APFSDS rod with less kinetic energy.The new prototype uses a single piece ammunition, allowing it to contain a much longer penetrator. The new one piece 125mm ammunition will allow for larger APFSDS rods, while retaining the current calibre to save weight rather than creating a bigger diameter gun.This new gun might mean the PLA is in the midst of introducing a new tank, or they might redesign the turret of the current Type-99A2 to have a longer bustle.=======================================================EDITA Quora userHe argued that the real reason behind the delays had to do with unrealistic expectations of the government. Lofty ideas for military projects that are not practical. This consumed time and resources which delayed the natural progression of development.

The Type99 MBT is a good example of ""good enough"" it can stand up to anything Russia, Pakistan, India or Vietnam fields.

But they're cheap and as long as the infantry dismounts early they can hold back and offer fire support. Comparing it to Japan's equally terrible Type 96 I can honestly say I don't know which one is worse. Now Japan does have the the Type 86 which is​​Artillery wise Id say Japan is some what lacking compared to china. To keep it short I'm just going to look at self propelled artillery.​Japan fields the Type99 155mm L52 system. It weight 40 tons and has a 300km operational range. It can max fire 6 rounds per minute and has a dedicated ammo resupply vehical. It's basically a pretty generic sparty system.​China has the PLZ-05 155mm L52 which is lighter and has a longer 500km operational range. Its peak rate of fire is 10 rounds per minute but I'm not sure how long it can maintain that or what kind of resupply system Chinese artillery uses. But, over all it appears to be a superior weapon and the Chinese are constantly improving it and it's ammunition.","3,503 followers",Tim Chiappone,5.7K,255,4.6M,2017,https://www.quora.com/Why-is-China-so-weak-in-some-technologies-Tanks-Armored-Vehicles-while-Japan-is-so-developed-in-them
