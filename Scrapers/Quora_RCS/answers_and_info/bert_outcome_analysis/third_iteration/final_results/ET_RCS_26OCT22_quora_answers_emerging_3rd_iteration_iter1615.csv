As Robert Wright argues in the amazing book,Most of the massive changes driving human history have been communications revolutions.

Well, if you buy the argument that the big revolutions are those that bring more and more brains into proximity of each other, then the next big change will be the merging of the internet with our brains.Right now, the main things keeping our brains from being literally connected to the internet areBut things change.My guess is that the technology that enables our brains to communicate with the internet will start with the treatment of major neurological disabilities.The therapeutic use cases could very easily evolve into enhancement. Human enhancement of this nature raises a massive host of ethical issues.But again, things change.I don't know if this will lead to the Singularity that people like Ray Kurzweil talk about.
