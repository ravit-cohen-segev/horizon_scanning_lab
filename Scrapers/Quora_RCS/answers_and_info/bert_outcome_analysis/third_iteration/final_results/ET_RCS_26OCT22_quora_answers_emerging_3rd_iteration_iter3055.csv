1,"Yes. Not just truck drivers, but autonomous vehicles will make all human driving as a profession obsolete (cabs, limo’s, trucks, trains, planes, boats, everything eventually). Hopefully we can find a way to have former drivers provide a valuable service besides driving (or unloading a truck for that matter because that will be automated as well) by the time this is a reality.The economic factors will be too compelling for this not to be the case.","1,844 followers",Richard Klaus,5.9K,1.3K,14.5M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Do-you-think-that-advancing-technology-will-eventually-make-truck-drivers-obsolete

Then, engages the system in just the same way as cruise control and sensors take over. It's got fully adaptive cruise control and crash avoidance systems. Sensors embedded in the roadway will keep the truck in line.The onboard computer measures the weight of the load and automatically choses which gear to use and how much power the engine gets. This leaves the driver free to do other things that would normally be considered illegal. If there's a problem such as an obstacle, the driver will be notified by an alarm tone while the truck makes the necessary corrections.Disconnecting the automated driving system is as easy as touching the brake, fuel or steering wheel.Currently there is no scheduled release date and at an estimated $350,000 a pop, I don't see my boss rushing out to get any.","2,507 followers",Dan Bowkley,1.4K,1.5K,13.1M,2017,https://www.quora.com/Do-you-think-that-advancing-technology-will-eventually-make-truck-drivers-obsolete

They farmed the job out to local mercenaries who lacked enthusiasm for the assignment.The CIA knew about two known al Qaeda agents, Khalid Almihdhar and Nawaf Alhazmi, when they were still in the Middle East. The CIA had searched their hotel room and found their US visas. These two went on to be photographed attending an al Qaeda summit in Kuala Lumpur. The CIA lost them in Bangkok, and they flew to Los Angeles. They wound up living with an FBI informant in San Diego under their own real names. They were listed in the phone book and everything. One of their benefactors received a charitable check from Princess Haifa, the wife of the Saudi Ambassador. The Saudi Ambassador, Prince Bandar, was so close to George W. Bush that he was known as “Bandar Bush”.Below is Bandar listening to a fish story from W, probably at the Crawford ranch. Below that is Bandar at the White House two days after 9/11. ( I bet we’re looking at $5000 worth of shoes in that picture.) (Looks like they’re chuckling at some witticism uttered by the President. It appears that the Vice President is not amused.) (Note Bandar’s showing of the sole to the National Security Advisor. Very disrespectful. My guess is that she noticed.)The CIA knew about these two al Qaeda agents. One of them had lived in an al Qaeda communications hub in Yemen for a year. This hub’s communications were monitored by the NSA, and separately by the CIA, and simple audio bugs were installed in the building as well.A couple of FBI guys who had been seconded to the CIA unit wanted to share the information with their FBI colleagues. They were initially prohibited from doing so, but ultimately the FBI got the heads up. The FBI had a bitter argument about whether these two known al Qaeda agents should be subjected to a full-scale criminal investigation or a more limited intelligence investigation. The intel probe was done by a rookie in the FBI’s NYC office. Within days he wanted to run a credit card check on the two terrorists. He was over-ruled by an FBI superior, Dina Corsi.The credit card check would have revealed that these known al Qaeda agents had purchased ten airline tickets dated 9/11/01 under their own real names. The Mossad named these two in their own warning before 9/11, and also named the two alleged WTC pilots.There were warnings before 9/11 from 12 foreign countries, 4 FBI offices, and the CIA. CIA honchos Tenet, Blee, and Black put the blame on the National Security Advisor, Dr. Condoleezza Rice, because they knew that the so-called “liberal media” would never dare to criticize her in any way. The media even gave her a pass on torture. She chaired the Principals Committee that approved the torture policies in the spring of 2002, months before there was any pretense of any legal cover. She told the CIA “It’s your baby, go do it!” The media gave her a pass on perjury. She lied under oath to the faces of the 9/11 widows when she testified that the CIA’s “Bin Laden Determined to Strike in US” memo was “not a warning” and did not contain new threat information.In 2005, the head of the CIA, Porter Goss, told TIME Magazine that he had an “excellent” idea of where Osama was, but they weren’t going after him.",0 followers,Brian Good,1.2K,25.2K,16.9M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Do-you-think-that-advancing-technology-will-eventually-make-truck-drivers-obsolete

Now since I have been involved with only one organization, the information I am going to disclose may not apply to all or any of the agencies mentioned in the question. To maintain ambiguity I shall not disclose the names of any agencies in any particular context in this answer.The real world of intelligence is very different and often unforgiving from the world shown to you by the movie directors. First of all Intelligence gathering is not just about Spies. It consists of different methods like IMINT, ELINT, SIGINT, HUMINT, and Cyber Securities.Inside the intelligence community you are fiercely loyal to your immediate bosses and nobody else matters. You can never know everything your boss knows and the same way it follows up to the highest authority.Also a fact that most people don’t know is that the common agencies that they talk about everyday i.e. CIA, ISI, RAW/IB, FSB, MOSSAD, MI6, DIA, or whatever bullshit name you know are actually not intelligence gathering agencies in true sense. These are only organizations comprising of analysts. They are like the “tip of an iceberg.” Most of these analysts have no clue about the source of the data or report they are analyzing.The real job of intelligence gathering is done by a number of top secret agencies at times without any name or even nationality! These agencies are identified by an alpha-numeric serial signature and only one or two people in the government know about these agencies and their work. Each of these agencies are extremely well funded and well equipped with all the resources at their disposal required for their objectives. Each of these agencies have their own departments of IMINT, ELINT, SIGINT, HUMINT and Cyber security with their own experts loyal only to the organization and nobody else.These are some of the most powerful operational bodies on earth and they mean business. As a common citizen of this world how many times have you wondered that why is it so difficult for a super power to defeat a primitive jihadist terrorist organization? Or how despite there being such highly competent agencies are countries not able to curb evils like black marketing, international human trafficking and illicit drug trade? Why do politicians make tall claims about changing national policies but go mute once they win elections or come to power? This is because these activities are carried out under the supervision of these secret agencies. You have been fooled continuously with the fact that Intelligence Operations are funded by “taxpayer’s money.” The bigger an intelligence organization gets, the more secrecy it starts to observe, then comes a point where it grows so big and deep that it stops informing even the government of it’s actions. When it doesn’t inform the government, it needs to find other means to arrange finances to fund it’s operations. This is achieved by enabling and facilitating black marketing, illicit drug trade and human trafficking. Intelligence is an addictive world and this addiction can take you all the way down to the bottom hole where the difference between morality or immorality is slim to none. At this stage, your nationality doesn’t matter anymore and the only thing which matters is “supremacy” over other such agencies.Since these independent agencies have access to almost every government in the world, these are the agencies holding the most crucial information many a times. However, to retrieve this information, the government agencies must beg and please these agencies to provide them with what they seek. That happens for a price always.There are some agencies which are independent and yet loyal to the cause of a national interest and they work independently to pass useful information to the government of that country. These agencies receive a large amount of funds from the government and also from the black market in the form of commissions upon every successful trade they facilitate. I was/am a part of one such agency.I being a satellite imagery expert was/am associated with IMINT department of my agency. I was given objectives by my boss upon which I used to research and report. My reports were then forwarded to one of the analysts of a “government agency” who received IMINT reports about the same objective from different sources like my agency. This analyst would then compare all the reports and compile a report which was forwarded to his senior analyst. Now this senior analyst was receiving several other such “compiled reports” from different methods of intelligence gathering and he would compare all the compiled reports and zero in onto the most possible outcome. His report would then go to his director who would receive similar reports from several such senior analysts. The director would stitch all these reports to form the bigger picture and then present it to whoever is the head of intelligence in that country. This head of intelligence then briefs the head of the state about the situation and gives a recommendation.This is the way most intelligence operations work. While many of the government agencies have their own experts of different fields but their employees are not the best talents on the planet as they are not payed the best salaries. The best salaries are paid to the experts of independent agencies like mine. I was/am making anything between $14,000-$30,000 per month depending on the value of information I obtained. Which tax payer’s money in the world is capable of paying such salaries ?This kind of system ensures that the best information remains with the agencies with best deals to offer.
