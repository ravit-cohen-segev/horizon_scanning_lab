1,"Of course, world’s third mass-produced tank - WWI frenchBut electrical tanks would be pricier and have kinks with current tech compared to diesel or tourbine direct -powered ones. That didn’t means that such chassis are not R&Ded regularly over decades - they just never chosen for production.OTOH if you ask ‘can tank be accumulator battery-powered?’ - answer will be flat ‘not with current technology’Of course, world’s third mass-produced tank - WWI frenchBut electrical tanks would be pricier and have kinks with current tech compared to diesel or tourbine direct -powered ones.

2,"More then anything else? The USA only facing countries with third rate crew training, exceptionally outdated hardware, and fantastic terrain for a tank to traverse for 40 years. That, and a good marketing scheme.I hate to phrase it this way, but whenever people try to use the US record with the Abrams to say it's a great tank, this is the inevitable problem. It's record is built on fighting third rate crew in mostly junkyard salvage. That's all it's ever done in US service. The best the US has pitted it against that I can confirm was the T-72M1 firing 1970's era ammunition.It's an utterly averMore then anything else?

Compared to the rest of the western world, the cannon is nothing to write home about. Armour is good up front, but same can be said of the leopard 2, challenger 2, K2, etc. Guided munition compatibility is as bad as any other western tank. It's got a turbine engine, but that's a huge mixed bag.",32 followers,Michael DeWayne Toombs,997,0,0,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-do-you-think-military-vehicle-technology-will-replace-tanks-with
3,"Well a typical heavy tank of today could be a Abrams. Weighing around 70 tonnes, it would meet the requirements of a traditional heavy. Just faster and more maneuverable.Let's take a look at the last heavy tank. The M103. It was based on the Patton, but had a massive gun in a massive turret. Let's do that with the Abrams!(Regular M1A1 for comparison)Ladies and Gentlemen, that above is the Fictional M1A5E3 new U.S. Heavy tank!It uses the same chassis as the Abrams, to keep costs down. Same engine as well. However, that decreases it's speed because it has a new, massive turret, with more armor tWell a typical heavy tank of today could be a Abrams.

Same engine as well. However, that decreases it's speed because it has a new, massive turret, with more armor than ever and a much larger, 155mm gun! Obviously, such large guns have large ammo, so it has a large rack, which gives it that super big tumor at the back!Hope you liked it!",4 followers,Kyle Reynolds,611,0,0,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-do-you-think-military-vehicle-technology-will-replace-tanks-with
