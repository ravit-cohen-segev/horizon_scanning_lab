This:the spindle and distaff, was replaced by this:the spinning wheel, which in turn was replaced by modern spinning machines. Women used to spend huge amounts of time spinning thread and yarn. While people still knit and crochet, and a few still weave with hand looms, almost nobody spins fiber by hand any more. It's completely mind-numbing and there is no creativity or craft in it, unlike knitting.That's a question with hundreds of thousands of answers. I'll name just one.

Unlike the modern day where developments appear first on the chalkboard and in the lab and then make their way out to industry, most historical technological changes were inventions of working craftsmen, and the philosophers stepped in later to systematize the observations and inventions of other people. The library of Alexandria would contain summaries on those topics, not original works.The library of Alexandria was not the only place knowledge existed. The books there were written by scholars who survived any given episode of destruction, and there were hundreds of libraries around the Roman world as well as private collections of books. Destroying the library would have been a sad loss, but, much as if someone today were to destroy the Library of Congress, it wouldn’t eliminate all written information or any of the people who wrote it down to begin with.There’s no indication that anybody would want to suppress technology. While the Romans had a generally conservative attitude towards pretty much everything, that didn’t stop them from adopting useful new technologies when they came up. The Romans had no problems using new developments which showed up during classical antiquity, from gear trains to blown glass to water wheels. Indeed, they quite enjoyed the (to them) high-tech marvels of hydraulic auto-opening doors in temples and fake gods being lifted onto theatrical stages by machines.To sum up, then: there’s no reason to believe that such things existed in the first place, destroying the library would do nothing to destroy the information, and nobody would have wanted to destroy it anyway.",22 followers,Spencer McDaniel,1.8K,2.1K,61.5M,2019,https://www.quora.com/How-are-modern-advanced-technologies-helpful-to-Indian-students

So would any number of present day national archives.For present purposes, let us divide the “knowledge” at Alexandria into two categories: frontiers of human knowledge, and details of human knowledge.By “frontiers,” I mean concepts in natural philosophy - things like mathematics, physics, chemistry, and so forth. In terms of our understanding of those fields, we are far beyond anything Alexandria conceivably could have contained. If we sent a mathematician or a physicist back in time to Alexandria, they would find nothing in its library that would advance their fields.What they probablySame for engineering. Many of the details of how ancient craftsmen and builders made things are lost, and perhaps the library at Alexandria would contain treatises on such things. Doesn’t change the fact that modern people can build circles around the ancients. WeBut there are other kinds of knowledge, and those are lost forever.By “details” of knowledge, I mean specific works. For instance, we don’t have a copy of the epic poem theWould a complete copy revolutionize modern society? Of course not. It would probably wouldn’t even revolutionize classical studies. It sure would be neat, though.This is the sort of knowledge that we will never reconstruct. The lost works ofBut the works themselves - the specific way those specific people specifically thought - is gone, and there’s no way to get it back.

It’s not like Alexandria was theWhy, then, do people obsess over the library at Alexandria? Imagine if the entire Library of Congress disappeared overnight. Would we have lost knowledge? Not really. Virtually everything in the LoC’s archives exists in multiple other places. But if most of our entire civilization was lost, later researchers could be forgiven for not wanting to sift through every little library, archive, and private bookshelf that had survived. Those people might well lament, “If only we still had the Library of Congress!” Every time they heard about a work but couldn’t find the actual text, they’d go, “I bet the Library of Congress had that!” They would even wonder, “I wonder what works the Library of Congress had that nobody bothered to write about!” But the loss of the LoC wouldn’t set the modern world back from some abstract sense of civilizational progress, and it wouldn’t hold back future generations either.Same with the library at Alexandria.",UNKNOWN,Tim O'Neill,504,657,10.8M,2018,https://www.quora.com/How-are-modern-advanced-technologies-helpful-to-Indian-students

We do not think China is an advanced country.Many people come to China to see the big cities in China. Indeed, the developed degree of big cities has far surpassed that of Europe and America. With all due respect, no offense, I have been to the United States and based on my investigation of European countries, I really don't think there are several places in Europe that are more developed than the coastal cities in eastern China.Yes, China's GDP is indeed the second largest in the world, and its economy has grown rapidly for nearly 40 years. China is far ahead of the neighboring countries in various indicators. China's system and model have brought great development to China, and at the same time, Chinese people have become more and more confident.Once China was very worried about the neighboring countries, especially the western countries think less of China. This is a very easy-to-understand mentality. When your strength is really insufficient, you will really worry about being despised.Let me give you an example.In the 1980s there was a TV series called ""Warrior fearless"", which attracted many Chinese people to watch. This is a TV drama about Chinese Kong Fu. At the beginning of the 20th century, China was called ""sick man of East Asia"" by foreigners, and the protagonist of Jingwu Hero is a Chinese who is proficient in Kung Fu. It tells how this man defeated the Japanese in the fighting.On the board said: ""sick man of East Asia""Today, Chinese people no longer need such TV dramas to boost their confidence. Because self-confidence itself is a kind of mood or emotion, the source of self-confidence is strength. In particular, China has suffered a hundred years of humiliation, and the confidence of Chinese people has been shattered. Now the Communist Party of China has reshaped the confidence of Chinese people.I give this example to tell you that today's Chinese people can know themselves more clearly and objectively. Today's China has indeed made outstanding achievements, but today's China still has a long way to go, and today's China still has many problems to solve.When you have seen those photos, do you think China is a developed and advanced country?China has a population of 1.4 billion, and any small problem multiplied by 1.4 billion will become a major strategic problem. And any huge problem divided by 1.4 billion will become a small problem.The report of the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party of China pointed out：As socialism with Chinese characteristics has entered a new era, the principal contradiction facing Chinese society has evolved. What we now face is the contradiction between unbalanced and inadequate development and the people's ever-growing needs for a better life.Today, the development gap between eastern and western China is very large. How to solve the problem of people's lives in western China is what we need to solve at present. We can't just be satisfied with the development of eastern China, we can't just see the life of the rich, but we should be more comprehensive, see the present situation of western China and see the life of the poor.党的十九大报告双语全文This is the Chinese and English version of the report of the 19th CPC National Congress. Don't blindly attack the Communist Party, because up to now, I really haven't found any foreigners in Quora who have actually read the documents of the Communist Party. This report is very long, but when you read it carefully, you will find that the Communist Party has a very accurate grasp of China's current domestic and international situation.There is an old Chinese saying, ""Don't worry about poverty, but worry about unfairness.""（不患寡，患不均）Gini Index World Map in 2014File:2014 Gini Index World Map, income inequality distribution by country per World Bank.svgGini IndexStatistics can tell us that before 2014, China's Gini coefficient has reached a very dangerous edge. This will mean that the polarization between rich and poor is getting bigger and bigger, the poor will get poorer and the rich will get richer. This is definitely not a good phenomenon. If the Gini coefficient continues to rise, the hope of this country will become smaller and smaller.According to the statistics of the United Nations in 2012, the ratio of poor people in the world, the proportion of residents whose daily income is less than US$ 2 in various countries or regions in the world.File:Percentage population living on less than $2 per day.jpgGini Index World Map in 2019File:2014 Gini Index World Map, income inequality distribution by country per World Bank.svgBut in 2019, China's Gini coefficient began to decrease, which is a very positive signal. It means that the polarization between rich and poor is being artificially controlled. Different from western free countries, China has the most powerful control power in the world, and the Communist Party can impose interference on the income of the rich and the poor based on the Gini coefficient. Is interference good or bad? It is definitely not good for the rich, which means paying more taxes; But it is a good thing for the poor, which means that the state will give you more money and welfare protection.So, after reading this series of data, will you still think that China is a rich country? I really don't want to say that China is rich. There are many problems in China. China is far from the standard of a developed country. China is a promising country, but now China is still poor.Do you know the living conditions of Chinese migrant workers?Do you know the living conditions of white-collar workers in China?Do you know the living conditions of Chinese civil servants?Everyone wants to live a relaxed and prosperous life, but they don't have so many resources. How many people are trading their lives for a decent life?I don't worry when I see so many poor people in my country, but when I see so many people struggling without a fair chance, I will be very worried and distressed.We are not afraid of poverty. My father was once poor and my grandfather was poorer. China was once very poor. We have our hands, we have our brains. Today, China has become rich on its own, and we are confident to eliminate poverty.I'll tell you another story.As foreigners, speaking of the Communist Party, you will definitely think that it is an authoritative rule without freedom and control everywhere. Indeed, China is a centralized country. Only when this centralization is used in the right direction, its effect is very prominent.Guess how old this man is in the middle.He is 40 years old this year, but he looks as if he is already in his fifties.This is a Communist at the grass-roots level, and his task is to ""poverty alleviation"". In China, ""poverty alleviation"" is a national strategy. Those are tasks that must be completed.This Communist may not be so good-looking, but you will find that his hair is white.The red circle indicates he was born in 1980.This Li Zhongkai is the ""post-80s White Hair Secretary"" in Yunnan Province, China, which attracted wide attention at the end of 2018. Now he is still busy in the front line of poverty alleviation. Li Zhongkai said that since poverty alleviation, all 12 local poor villages have been lifted out of poverty, and 1,625 households with 6,399 people have been lifted out of poverty. He said that through industrial poverty alleviation, the local walnut and pepper industries have been consolidated, especially the mango industry has become the pillar for people to get rid of poverty and become rich.With the innovation of communication technologies such as 5G in China, more and more rural areas have embarked on the way of ""getting rich by e-commerce"".The rural e-commerce classroom is teaching villagers how to open their own shops onlineThe rural e-commerce after-sales service centerThe rural e-commerce product display cabinetThe rural e-commerce companyThe rural e-commerce logistics centerWhat do the poor need?The answer is pretty simple:HOPE",0 followers,Ezio Yao,743,215,5.9M,2020,https://www.quora.com/How-are-modern-advanced-technologies-helpful-to-Indian-students

It is particularly galling for us Indians as our democracy is a functioning anarchy. Also, nefarious designs by the country across the border that wants to encircle us and aid our arch-enemy Pakistan even if it maintains that its real battle is with the United States for superpower status.According to me, the reasons are to do more with culture and history than anything else. The Chinese have always been used to kowtowing to a strong central authority like brutal and ruthless emperors in old times, and the nearly 70 year old Communist government now. Also, we have to give credit to the wisdom and foresight of their leaders.Most of the Chinese I have encountered within and outside India are very proud of their nation and cannot hear a single word against it. Compare this to extreme freedom of speech in our country, where it is fashionable to chant ‘division of country’ in universities named after a ‘so-called’ founding father of the country.While both Indians and Chinese are unethical, the Chinese will still keep the greater glory of the country in mind, while Indians will sell out their nation for a pittance, or self importance. After the U.S, India has the biggest trade deficit with China, and our politicians are doing precious little to rectify it unlike Trump. Like the British who used Indian money to fund the colonisation of the country, the Chinese are using their trade surplus with India which exceeds our defence budget to fund the encirclement of this nation.I would never want to live in a society like the Chinese, but that does not detract from the fact that their material progress is admirable and needs to be emulated. Even as less as 40 + years back, we had a bigger economy than the Chinese who went around in bicycles.The country’s remarkable progress also lies in their own hard work, discipline and Western assistance. Nixon’s reset of relations with the Chinese in the 70s and a wise leader like Deng Xiaoping who unlike Mao was a pragmatist seized the opportunity offered by a self-interested but always singularly fascinated by China ‘West’.The country put wise policies in place that initially copied their products whole-sale, but since have moved up the value chain. Unlike Indians who are content with working for some global(mostly American) MNC, China has encouraged their home-grown firms who are now beginning to dominate the biggest companies in the world listings. Indian unicorns are content in selling their entire stake to foreign entities. They have invested heavily in infrastructure across every sector, seeking parity and now overshadowing the West, the rest of Asia and the world.Just an illustrative fact, with only 55000 kms of railway network in 1985, China trailed India which had around 62000 kms then. Now, the Chinese have the longest as well as maximum. high-speed railway tracks in the world. They have built some of the biggest engineering projects(dams and bridges) and are trying to build artificial moons and other heavenly entities.

How powerful is the US?From the political, economic, scientific and technological, military, cultural, diplomatic, and other aspects. China can't compete with the United States in any aspect.A. The US political powerThe US election is the most concerned political event in the world. Any American president who takes office will influence the direction of the world.For example, Trump, an “incredible“man who could not be found for hundreds of years, became the president of the United States. If he is in other fields, it may not have any influence. But he is now the president of the United States.But it is not that he is terrible, but that the global leadership of the United States is terrible!If he is the leader of a very underdeveloped country, I don't think most newspapers will even report it.B. The strength of the US economyThe strength of the US economy can be seen all over the world. The United States has not only influence but control over the global economy!C. The US science and technologyThe US stands at the forefront of science and technology in the world. Most of the high technology in the world is in the hands of Americans or American laboratories. For example, today's China is developing its aerospace industry, which is an achievement that attracts worldwide attention. However, we all know that compared with the United States, we are inferior to the United States and the former Soviet Union at the beginning of the Cold War.But I think Leonard's genius is that a nerd can have a girlfriend like Penny.D. The US militaryThe US military ranks first in the world, and I believe no one will refute me.The largest conventional aircraft carrier in the world is the Kitty Hawk of the US Navy. This aircraft carrier has participated in many foreign operations of the US military.The United States Marine Corps, the firm executor of the national will of the United States, can basically defeat other countries with only one US Marine Corps.I don't think any country in the world would be stupid enough to challenge the United States militarily.5 steps to reshape the US military: Glean, Engage, Focus, Incentivize, and Share.The Kitty Hawk of the US NavyE. The US cultureAmerican culture is an important manifestation of American soft power. Almost everyone on earth knows Hollywood, and even some people may not know where the capital of the United States is, but they must have heard of Titanic and Rambo, an American hero who can beat hundreds of people by himself. Most written works in the world are written and recorded in English. American music is basically the trend. The American brand is basically the guarantee of quality. It can be said that where there are people, there will be American cultural influence, except for newborns in hospitals.TitanicRamboII. What are the advantages of China?China's greatest advantage is the people.From the military point of view, the PLA under the leadership of the Communist Party of China has no advantage in weapons and equipment. But the People's Liberation Army has accomplished every military operation task brilliantly. Because Chairman Mao said: ""The decisive factor in war is people, not weapons and equipment."" Is it true that China respects the US military because the US military has the most powerful weapons and equipment? No, it is because the extraordinary courage displayed by the US military on the battlefield deserves China's respect.Let me show you a couple of the examples that the power of people:A. What has the Communist Party of China done in the history of being regarded as a communist devil by the West?The first National Congress of the Communist Party of China was held secretly in this boat, Shanghai on July 23, 1921. The meeting was attended by only 12 people, announcing the founding of the Communist Party of China. Today, China has 90 million Party members.Under the military attack of the Kuomintang, the army led by the Communist Party was forced to move. The journey is more than 20,000 miles, also known as the 25,000-mile Long March. During the journey, it has traveled 25,000 miles through 11 provinces, 18 mountains, 24 rivers, deserted grassland, and rolling snow-capped mountains.After the Long March, there were only 30,000 Communist troops.In 1932, he was commissioned by the CPC Central Committee to organize the Anti-Japanese Coalition Forces in Northeast China and served as the commander and political commissar of the Anti-Japanese Coalition Forces. He led the soldiers and civilians to fight bloody battles with the Japanese aggressors in the northeast. In the extremely cold environment, under the emergency of running out of ammunition, he finally fought alone with a large number of Japanese aggressors for a few days and nights and died heroically. When the Japanese army caught him, they cut open his stomach and found that there were only bark and cotton in his stomach. He kept fighting by eating these. At that time, the Japanese army stood up and saluted, because Yang Jingyu was a very respectable fighting hero of Communist Party members.The Liberation War was a war waged by the Chinese People's Liberation Army under the leadership of the Communist Party of China from June 1946 to September 1949 to overthrow the Kuomintang rule and liberate the whole of China. It is a decisive battle concerning China's future and destiny. On October 1, 1949, the People's Republic of China was proclaimed in Beijing on the way of PLA marching to the whole country. In 1951, the PLA completed the task of liberating the mainland and offshore islands and the Communist Party of China unified the Chinese mainland.The Communist Party of China has done a lot of things. She made China independent, and at the same time, she led the Chinese people to work hard to build the motherland.Many overseas Chinese are constantly discrediting the Communist Party. It doesn't matter. More than one billion Chinese people now support the Communist Party of China. Is this party good or bad? If the Communist Party is really an extremely evil party, how can it monitor and control 1.4 billion Chinese people?Is it because China is really sinful that it keeps smearing China? Or something else?B. What are the strange characteristics of the Chinese people?Chinese people's character comes from Chinese culture. It is not deep to get in touch with the Chinese without understanding the Chinese character.China's college entrance examination is the exam with the largest number of participants in the world. The history of examinations in China has exceeded 1400 years.Every year in the college entrance examination in June, all cars in China will not whistle, so it is necessary to create a quiet environment for the candidatesParents waiting anxiously outside the examination roomExamination in ancient China. In the highest examinations in ancient China, the invigilator was the emperor. At the same time, any candidate who tries to cheat will be decapitated immediately once he is found.2. Chinese people especially like farmingChina's geographical environment determines that the people here will make a living by farming. Until today, as long as Chinese people see a good piece of land, they will not plant flowers, but grow vegetables.The picture above shows Chinese people growing vegetables in the Antarctic scientific research stations, deserts, university campuses, and space.3. Chinese people love saving money and grainWhen Americans were suffering from pneumonia in COVID-19, many people took to the streets. In fact, it is not necessarily opposed to wearing masks, but Americans do not have the habit of saving money. If the United States does not resume its economic activities, the American people will be unable to live because they have no jobs. But at the request of the Communist Party of China, 1.4 billion people stayed at home. Chinese people can stay at home for two months without going to the streets. It is because Chinese people have the habit of saving money. A country that has been poor for hundreds of years will not spend all its money once it has earned it.4. An incomparable yearning for peaceA unified and centralized country, a country with peasants as its main people, needs a peaceful environment most. Because it is impossible to fight there, I still farm here. Chinese people have always hoped to have a peaceful environment for them to cultivate their land, save some money, and then let their children receive a good education.5. Chinese people's deep love for their families and countriesChina attaches great importance to education. Therefore, Chinese culture can be preserved from generation to generation after thousands of years. In education, loyalty and justice are emphasized. This is why Chinese people have a very strong concept of territory and nationality. Every generation of Chinese will tell their children that you are a Chinese, that you are a Chinese who eat with chopsticks, and that you are a Chinese who write Chinese characters.A very famous story in China, Yue Fei, a famous general in Chinese history, had his mother tattooed his back before joining the army. There are four Chinese characters on it,Every Chinese has been fed with chopsticks in this way, which is calledEvery Chinese child will be taught to use chopsticks by his parents.When eating in China, only the elders say they can eat, and the rest can eat. This is called a6. Once oppressed too much, peaceful farmers will become fearless fightersIn Chinese history, all those who rebelled were peasants. As long as farmers have food to eat, they will not rebel. Once they are starving, Chinese farmers will rise to revolt. Therefore, Chinese people are not afraid of power in their genes. Indeed, many emperors in Chinese history were rebellious peasants. The earliest peasant uprising in Chinese history was the uprising of Chen Sheng and Wu Guang in 209 BC. At that time, the west was still the Roman Republic.What I want to say is that these characteristics of Chinese people come from China's poverty and backwardness, and also from its own understanding. Chinese people may be bullied, but it is impossible to kill all Chinese people.The US is powerful, and the American people are a symbol of freedom and independence. China cannot compete with the United States in any form.III. In the endThe US is the most developed country in the world. The US is ahead of China in every respect. China has been actively learning from the United States. Americans are Chinese teachers.But China does have its advantage, that is, its people.The national anthem of China today was created at the most dangerous time in Chinese history. Her lyrics are like this:起来！不愿做奴隶的人们！把我们的血肉，筑成我们新的长城！中华民族到了最危险的时候，每个人被迫着发出最后的吼声。起来！起来！！起来！！！我们万众一心，冒着敌人的炮火，前进！冒着敌人的炮火，前进！前进！前进进！Get up!People who do not want to be slaves!Build our flesh and blood into our new Great Wall!When the Chinese nation is at its most dangerous time,Everyone was forced to make the final roar.Get up!Get up! !Get up! ! !We are United as one, braved the enemy's fire,Forward!

Not until they decided to build this monster:Very few countries, not more than 3 or 4, can manufacture these machines. India has to import all TBMs, we don't have any capacity to build one.They also have this monster:It is used to build railway tracks. It can do the job, much faster and perfectly.In manufacturing, research and development, and technology India doesn't even stand a chance against China. Comparing the two is preposterous. The pathetic state of Indian manufacturing can be gauged from the fact that 69 years after independence, India can't even manufacture products as simple as earphones. Yes, even your earphones are probably manufactured in China, though they might contain a Made in India tag, to fool the Indians.Comparing the two countries would be a great injustice to China. Most of Chinese people don't want their country to be compared with India, they think of it below their dignity, the same way we think of Pakistan. They like to compare their country with countries like America and Japan.Images source:",469 followers,Daniel Cohort,11.9K,377,1.2M,2019,https://www.quora.com/How-and-why-is-China-so-advanced

The Chinese economy has done remarkably well over the last three decades, consistently ranking among the fastest-growing in the world. It has attracted significant amount of foreign direct investment, and has become the largest trading country.The Chinese reform since 1978 ranks as one of the most extraordinary episodes of social and economic transformation in history: industrialization, marketization, urbanization, and globalization all occurring at the same time.Also China does not have a competitive political party system.2. Development as the Top PriorityFor many in China, electoral democracy just is not suitable for all nations, and those developing countries including China needed stability and economic development before they could afford the luxuries of liberal democracy and personal liberty in a Western mold. That argument is gaining traction in China. After the Tiananmen protest in 1989, many pundits predicted that China will soon collapse. Since the mid-70s the wave of democratization swept the world, a large number of authoritarian regimes have collapsed. In the late 1980s and 1990s, the whole socialist camp in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union collapsed. In this global context, China’s experience is very much a “miracle”. As Deng Xiaoping said, economic development is the priority (fa zhan cai shi ying dao li). In post-Mao China, priority was changed from political campaigns to economic development. China’s economy maintains steady growth and the regime as a whole continues to enjoy some level of acceptance. With the strong economy, the regime as a whole continues to enjoy high level of acceptance. In the aftermath of the global financial crisis in 2008, the China model is even acquiring normative and policy significance as it has been used to challenge the intellectual pillars of the “Washington Consensus”.3. Focus on Good Governance“Good governance” has recently become a buzzword among Chinese policymakers and academics. It is increasingly reflected in reform practices at all levels of government in response to emerging social, political, economic, and environmental issues, as well as to challenges posed by China’s market-oriented reforms and rapid modernization. Broadly defined, “good governance” is about the “exercise of economic, political and administrative authority to manage a country’s affairs at all levels,” with special consideration for such good universal norms and practices as participation, the rule of law, transparency, responsiveness, consensus orientation, equity, effectiveness and efficiency, accountability and strategic vision . There is a growing consensus among Chinese scholars that good governance is crucial for the establishment of a functioning democracy.The core value of democracy is to reflect the will of the people and achieve good governance. Chinese scholars and people hold that China should promote democracy through good governance not via direct national elections. With this in mind, an increasing number of scholars are paying attention to the importance of good governance rather than focusing on electoral democracy.4.The reform in China is marked by incremental and piecemeal changes. Compared with that of the Soviet Union, China’s reform shave been executed more cautiously and more slowly. Over the past three decades the CCP has been undertaking “incremental changes”, drifting away from the orthodox Marxist ideology. The popular term in the post-Deng’s era among the CCP leaders is yu shi ju jin, meaning that the party must be adaptable and flexible to the changing governance environment. There is no reform blueprint. Instead, China’s reform is known as “crossing the river by feeling the stone”, partial reform composed of economic liberalization and political conservatism. Since then, China has been “feeling the stones” for more than three decades.5.Other Moves5.1 China’s leaders decided they wanted the country to be known for a new kind of electronics– not only “Made in China”, but “Designed in China”.5.2 China is a country where personal cheques and credit cards never went mainstream, paying with your smartphone has become the norm: in 2016, China’s mobile payment market was 50 times the size of that in the US`5.3 China’s established internet titans – Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent, sometimes called “BAT” – began as clones of US companies like Google and eBay.There are many other reasons which could be stated and each point has many criticisms also but in my view these reasons are most important and vital for China's growth,development and advancement.","23,887 followers",Robin Daverman,11.8K,2.3K,40.1M,2019,https://www.quora.com/How-and-why-is-China-so-advanced
