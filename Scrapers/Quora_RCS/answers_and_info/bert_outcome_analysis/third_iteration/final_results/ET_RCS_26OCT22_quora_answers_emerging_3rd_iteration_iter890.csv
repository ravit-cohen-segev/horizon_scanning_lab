1,"You don’t advance technology as a monolith. Germany is a leader in material science and mechanical engineering.Germany is sub-par in software engineering and in its physical communication infrastructure. This is in part due to persistent cultural wariness of surveillance technologies like social media. People aren’t keen to fund the infrastructure to make mass surveillance easier, and politicians don’t want to be seen as pushing for the capability.Germany also has the capability to advance nuclear technology, but doesn’t due to mass scientific illiteracy among the voting population that falselYou don’t advance technology as a monolith.

Germany is not the most technologically advanced country. It could be pretty close, but there are major elements of society who dedicate themselves to making sure that Germany uses inferior technology that kills more people, damages the environment more, costs more money, and will cause the total collapse of Earth’s biosphere due to a runaway greenhouse effect. Mostly in the Green Party. Because radiation from nuclear accidents is apparently scarier than way more people dying of regular pollution constantly and the total annihilation of all life on Earth as the oceans boil away.","5,990 followers",Jens Böttiger,566,2.6K,17.6M,2021,https://www.quora.com/According-to-NetworkWorld-edge-computing-is-about-to-boom-Are-you-ready-for-the-next-technology-advancements
2,"No, but yes.Edge computing augments centralized cloud computing by providing performance boosts inNo, but yes.Edge computing augments centralized cloud computing by providing performance boosts inFundamentally, Cloud Computing provides two often-conflated but independent advantages:There are certainly use-cases which can’t take advantage of the first point for the foreseeable future — smart cars, ships, hospitals, pacemakers. Not all hardware can be moved to a data center.But everybody — and I mean everybody — wants the second point. If a customer can use the Lambda API in an on-premise hardware installation, theyCloud providers realize this, and are providing these services:The future is all cloud-compatible software; nobody will be building software targeted for on-premise installations.But","68,778 followers",Kanthaswamy Balasubramaniam,898,17.3K,413.3M,2019,https://www.quora.com/According-to-NetworkWorld-edge-computing-is-about-to-boom-Are-you-ready-for-the-next-technology-advancements
3,"They have the four greatest advantages today(a) They have the Required Money for Research and Development(b) They have the Brains available to handle advanced Research - most of whom have learnt requisite skills from Foreign Countries and are ready to further the education for millions of chinese.(c) They have a Low Saturation Point since they were barely technology sufficient even 5 years ago. This means they have a(d) They have the worlds largest Capable populationBut their greatest Advantage - UNITYChinese Nationalism is trulyThey have the four greatest advantages today(a) They have the Required Money for Research and Development(b) They have the Brains available to handle advanced Research - most of whom have learnt requisite skills from Foreign Countries and are ready to further the education for millions of chinese.(c) They have a Low Saturation Point since they were barely technology sufficient even 5 years ago.

Because they have a very hungry demand and loads of money and a very intelligent and trained populace.",639 followers,Said Nusir,572,0,0,2021,https://www.quora.com/According-to-NetworkWorld-edge-computing-is-about-to-boom-Are-you-ready-for-the-next-technology-advancements
