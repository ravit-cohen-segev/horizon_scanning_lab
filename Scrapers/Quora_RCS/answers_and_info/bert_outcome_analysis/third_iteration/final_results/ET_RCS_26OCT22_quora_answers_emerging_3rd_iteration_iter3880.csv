0,"FarThat said, it’s likeFarThat said, it’s likely that Africa would be more economically developed and therefore technologically developed had it not been for colonialism. Instead of taking over and extracting profits for the benefit of shareholders back in Europe, Europeans would have traded with Africans, leaving behind more of the benefits of that trade in Africa, with the added bonus of fewer external disruptions on African politics. This is not to say that Africa was ever a peaceful, idyllic place, but at least conflicts would be based on local factors, not local and colonial ones layered on top of one another. And a somewhat wealthier, somewhat more stable Africa could hardly help but have better distribution of technology.","10,524 followers",Didier Champion,2.1K,1.6K,16.9M,2020,https://www.quora.com/If-we-kept-the-major-events-of-the-last-500-years-industrialization-exploration-colonialism-world-wars-advanced-technology-and-the-Internet-etc-but-replaced-the-major-players-with-African-culture-and-nations-how-would-the-world-be-different-today
1,"Interesting question. I will give you my two cents an African.Is Africa poor because of colonization?Simple answer:Long answer:RespeInteresting question. I will give you my two cents an African.Is Africa poor because of colonization?Simple answer:Long answer:Respect and dignity are earnedWhat about if colonization never happened?These what-ifs questions are really pointless in my opinion.Imagine a Rwandan asking:Why are many African countries still lagging behind economically?Colonization was a terrible experience for Africans. No question about it.However, blaming Africa’s problems today solely on colonization is just preposterous. It is a lack of responsibility and accountability on the African’s side.For starters, this is a map of Africa and the European invasion on the continent in the early 20th century. Major colonizers are France, United Kingdom, followed by Spain, Portugal, Italy, Belgium, and Germany.In my opinion, the biggest mistake that Africans made after the so-called “ independence” was to keep Europeans around in their business. They should have cut them off completely, diplomatically and any other bilateral relations they had with Europeans. Till today, that is the African’s problems.The Europeans have never had any interests to develop or to “ civilize” Africans. All they came to Africa to do was for their own self-interests. This is why any African leader who tried to push for the complete independence of Africans was killed and murdered by the Europeans.Didier Champion's answer to Why was Thomas Sankara killed?Africa’s problems todayTill today, many African countries are not really free. They are “misguided” and controlled by Europeans and North Americans for the most part. Who would you blame for this? I blame Africans to allow Europeans to dominate them for another half a century. We have became way too dependent on Europeans. Many of our leaders are absolute shit and quite frankly useless.Africa Intra tradeHome | African UnionThe real reason why Africa still lags behind economically as a continent because:All these things are simple stuff we should be doing to create jobs, collect more taxes, increase GDPs and create independent and free economies. There is no way you can be free when you are still dependent on your former slave masters in the forms of “ peanuts” aid.Change of mentalityIf Africa had gotten rid of Europeans from the 1970’s, countries would have no choice but to trade with one another developing their economies. Instead of exporting their raw materials, they would have developed their industries to export finished products for more money. Instead, the events of imperialism, the cold war gave rise to dictators and all revolutionary leaders in the independence movement were killed one by one in more than 40 African countries.This list can go on and on. You can talk about DRC, Equatorial Guinea, Cameroun, and quite frankly majority of the countries. Again, if Africans had stopped bilateral relations with the West, they would have worked together to develop themselves and their economies through trade, business, innovation and entrepreneurship. The same way that Asian countries such as South Korea, China, and others did it.Look at this map above about Africa’s abundant minerals and other natural resources. There is absolutely no reason why we should have oil refineries in the middle east when we can produce ours right here at home. Are you telling me that all these 10 or so countries cannot get together to create their own industries to make final products? Again, this is Africa’s problems. Not working together and thinking long term.Education, tribalism, and corruptionColonization left Africans feeling inferior to Europeans. After 70–100 years of domination, torture and brutal inhumane acts of violence and genocides, Africans thought that they were not as competitive as the Europeans.They should have set their differences aside and unite one people. As a Rwandan, I say this with absolute shame and disgust. I was born in the middle of a civil war and a brutal genocide broke out when I was barely five. Can I really blame the Belgians and the French on the Rwandan genocide? Yes, partially. But, I would be stupid to not say that Rwandans did the dirty work whatever France did behind the scenes. You see, Rwandan issues in the past and present should be solved by Rwandans themselves and not the Europeans ( Belgium, France, or Germany). To think otherwise is absolute craziness.The tribalism we have today, the identity politics, corruption, and many other issues, Europeans have nothing or little to do with that. These are African issues and can only be solved when we own them, accept them, and be accountable. They might have started during colonization but it is our fault that we still have them today.What should Africa do?All of these are African’s problems and not the Europeans. From the beginning, Europeans never wanted Africans to be “ independent” anyway. They fought hard to keep their stronghold with colonization. When they were forced to give in, they were probably surprised by the free pass they were given.Today, they control Africa through the aid industry and unfair trade practices. By African working together, they would have developed themselves before waiting what the Europeans have to say about them.Do you ever wonder why Africa has absolutely little say about their state of nations? Popular statements such as “Countries who trade with one another tend to be peaceful with one another. After WWII in Europe, Germany and France got friendly not because they liked each other, but because they had mutual benefits exchanging goods and services. If Africa had been trading within themselves, the wars we had in the 1980’s and 90’s, many of them would not have happened.Africa is not really free.Africans are still tied in the colonial chains of their masters in Africa Today.How can Africans be free and independent?Didier Champion's answer to What does Africa need to do to be independent: politically and economically?

Are they going to do it? Your guess is as good as mine.Over the years, my documents have been double and sometimes triple checked for literally no reason. I have been pulled out for “random” checks at Frankfurt, Heathrow, Schiphol, etc.. while traveling with my co-workers from Europe and USA were just chilling. Over time, you get to see what it is all about. It is an absolute disgrace, honestly.For more about Africa and what they need to do, check out my blog atHope you find them interesting and learn something new.Africa is not poor. It is managed poorly.Today, Europeans have little to do with Africa’s mediocrity. This is why any country who get a good visionary leader or a series of good leaders for a consecutive 10–15 years or more, they improve fast and quite well. Botswana, Seychelles, Mauritius are good examples. My home country of Rwanda is even a better example in this case.If Rwanda can do it, no country should have any excuse. Not even Somalia.“We must understand that the time for babysitting is over and that we will never develop as we feel we have a never-ending need for Europeans, Americans, Asians, or other babysitters.”Good leadership matters.Just leaders who care and have the passion for their people. African people don’t ask too much. Just hope for today and excitement for the future. The rest is really quite easy.

The Mughals, the Ottomans, the Andalusians, all were broken by the infidel “Franks”. “The end of the world is nigh, the 13th Mujaddid is soon to come”. Across West Africa, the Muslim scholars of the Fulbe, survey their region and find much to be improved. Their nomad cousins are oppressed by behaviours and laws that are unIslamic, the people are half-taught, mumbling words of prayer they do not understand and then running to bow before trees. Worse, their Kings encouraged this syncretism, despite their sworn word to submit before Allah and heed the words of his prophet.

The second and most important is ""choice"". The big, What-if? For example, a whole bunch of choices left me here, writing this answer at this moment; some recent, like how I’m an NFL fan just because I’ve always found FIFA boring and play Madden instead, some as far back as 1963, when my Grandfather sent my Mother to school.The 19th century was a pivotal time for the continent. The population was trending up, due to improving agricultural productivity and the literal fruits of the Atlantic exchange. Old empires were tilting, new states on the horizon. It was an era of growing state centralization, the leaders of the continent weren’t stupid, as vital cogs in the global trade system, and not ignorant of global events, or immune to the general pressures of the age. When the explorer Hugh Clapperton arrived Sokoto, he and the Caliph Muhammad discussed India. Arab traders were in contact with centralised states as far as Southern Africa. African tradition, or to be more exact, a traditional practice common to Bantu culture is to invite a guest to share news from their journeys. Thanks to the giant news dump, Mecca was, and is, Arabs were very informed. So, African leaders, both Muslim and non-Muslim, they kept up with “the times”.I’ll try to tell the story of what the continent would have been absent the European interlude. Short version, a whole lot of slavery, wars and a genocide or two thrown in, but with resulting states a lot more stable and with more global influence than at present. Now, this is all from my head, typing at a furious pace, so I apologise, there will be no specific dates, merely a sense of rolling centuries. I’ll do my best to adhere to the likely strategic decisions the states of the time would have taken, you can always ask for explanations behind my thought process in the comments section. If while reading you find a name that strikes you as familiar, rest easy, it was done on purpose. Very well then, unleash the Kraken! Or you know, let the story begin.It all started in Egypt, “civilisation”. If Africa was the dark continent, then Egypt was akin to the Pharos on the Alexandrian coast, a beacon of light drawing the fireflies of the world. They all came in their brief bursts of glory: Alexander, Caesar, Selim the Grim…in time, it drew the greatest man of the age. Napoleon’s victory beneath the shadows of the pyramids was the first of many dominoes. His victory was one more sign of the decadence ailing Islam. The pieces he left behind as he sailed to Paris and in the end, Waterloo, were picked up by one of Africa’s greatest rulers. An immigrant who was everything Alexander Hamilton dreamt he would be.Muhammad Ali was the leader of the Albanian contingent of troops sent to reclaim Ottoman suzerainty in Egypt. There he met with forces aspiring towards national strength, forces dissatisfied with Mameluke rule, he would harness those forces, and with blood and iron forge modern Egypt. The reverberations of his actions would be felt across the continent and beyond.If you’re thinking, that contains a fuck tonne of oil and sits atop one of the world’s most strategic trade routes. Fifty points! to your House of choice.For the purposes of this answer, we’ll assume that the European powers don’t let him keep Greece, handing it, its future revolutions, and the citizenship of the Greeks of Quora, back to the Ottomans. But the strictures of the question mandate that European countries have no designs on Africa. This makes France act an actual ally to Egypt. France fights Egypt’s corner, just as hard as the British fights the Ottomans. #They agree:• He withdraws from the gates of Constantinople• Signs a non-aggression pact with the Ottomans• Keeps the rule of Egypt hereditary in his family• Keeps Syria and the useless parts of Arabia, excepting the vital coastal areas. Britain occupies them, safe in the knowledge that her jewel is once again safe.If you’re thinking, Winston Churchill will be hopping mad when EAPET (Egyptian-American Petroleum Company), makes certain discoveries in those “useless parts”, you put Sherlock Holmes to shame.We’ll leave off Muhammad Ali and his considerable achievements to examine the reaction of the rest of the continent.Since the day the Romans burnt Carthage, the Maghreb states of Tunisia, Algeria and Libya (using their modern names for convenience) have had their fates always determined by the two states to their right and left. At present, the haven of the Barbary pirates, terrors of the Atlantic and Mediterranean, their trajectories do not project as high as that of Egypt or Morocco. Ottoman control has long been devolved to local potentates. #They’re fated to end up annexed by their neighbours.#Sultan Sulayman in modernising Morocco is met with the problem which has long plagued the monarchies of the nation, the nomadic tribes of the bilad al-Siba:On the first day of the first month of the second year of the 19th century, a man sat on the golden stool and became a god. What his old name was, it does not matter. With due reverence, the gathered representatives of the original states united by Osei Tutu into the Asante asked the god its name. Osei Bonsu (the whale) he replied.West Africa in the 19th century underwent its version of the Sengoku Jidai, the politics were driven, just beneath surface, by the reorientation of the region’s trade, from the Mediterranean to the Atlantic. Interior states who took advantage prospered, and seized control of their coasts thrived. These would be the Mandinka under Samori Toure, the Asante (hence the significance of “the whale”) and Dahomey. The Sokoto caliphate, phenomenal though its rise was, would not survive. Her rulers were Millenarians, awaiting the world’s end and the final pilgrimage to Mecca. More structurally, it was a confederation of monarchs soon reduced to mutual bickering, once the original revolutionaries had died. Most importantly, if in the past, its control of the “horse route” had lent her power, now that the gun was king, it came back to bite her in the arse. The last state of the region is the Oodua Kingdom.Usman Dan Fodio’s jihad-inspired the toppling of theAmidst mountains and caves, the previously disunited Egba were united by Sodeke, and there founded Abeokuta (a refuge from the storm), Kurumi, the most feared war chief of his time founded Ijaye, the war chiefs of old Oyo founded Ibadan on a hill overlooking the plains, finally, the Alaafin Atiba arrived to turn the village of Agoye into the town of Oyo. The Yoruba having lost their homes in the Savannah had found new ones in the forest. Alaafin Atiba entrusted the safety of their homes to the two most powerful states, and at Oshogbo, Ibadan proved itself worthy of that trust, forever ending the drive south of the Caliphate. It and Ijaye were successful in annexing the territories they had been “given” by the Alaafin. Peace seemed on the horizon, tradition and ambition, however, interfered.Alaafin Atiba had lived a colourful life, a rogue of man, but one who nonetheless had suffered much misfortune in his life. A fighting companion for most of them was his son, as death loomed, he had but one wish, that tradition be broken, and his son rather than die with him, be his successor. He entrusted his final request to his dear friend, the Aare of Ibadan. On the Alaafin’s death, the two most powerful states of the region found themselves on opposing sides. Kurunmi the old warrior, the autocrat of Ijaye stood for tradition, the war boys of Ibadan, that military republic damned the old ways, war followed. Ibadan won. Drunk with victory and absent the guiding hand of its wise old Aare who had died in the final push against Ijaye, the new Aare, the young rash Latosisa declared “a war to end all wars”. He would punish the states who had sided with Ijaye, unite the lands, ending wars forever. In opposition were the states he wished to punish, united in a coalition, the Ekitiparapo. Lending tacit support was the Alaafin, wary of an overweening Ibadan ruled by rash generals. In opposition, were the returnees of Sierra Leone, the Saro as they were called. Slaves rescued by the British anti-slavery squadrons, and manumitted slaves from South America who nevertheless chose to return home, they both found a home in a land, they called #Sierra Leone, from there, those who remembered their roots drifted to Yoruba land, most finding a home in Abeokuta.The war meant to end all wars lasted 16 years. It was called Kiriji, an onomatopoeic name for the first wars fought solely by gun-wielding infantry in the land. The 16 years had seen them go from muskets to repeating rifles, and yet, neither gun, nor artillery, not the sheer number of enemies a surrounded Ibadan faced had broken her; tens-of-thousands died, and yet, she fought them all to a standstill. #Finally, the Alaafin sent his oldest eunuch, bearing his personal standard, in the middle of no man’s land between both armies, the standard was planted. The Alaafin had put his ancient authority on the line of peace.#At the Alaafin’s palace, representatives from throughout the land met to discuss the changed situation. The good news was that the Egba had broken Dahomey’s expansion at the gates of Abeokuta. The Western and Northern frontiers were safe. The gathered delegates hailed the representatives of Abeokuta, strangely dressed men, graduates of the Fourah Bay College at Sierra Leone, where apparently the white man’s ways were taught. Gingerly, the Alaafin rose and relayed the bad news. The news filtering in from the East. The threats by the white men to themselves end the trade in slaves, and then, he spoke of their homes in the Savannah, he pointed to the bones of his Father awaiting internment at old Oyo. A lot was said, what matters are the results, recorded for posterity by the Abeokuta delegates. There, the representatives all prostrated before the Alaafin, hailed him as Kabiyesi (one who is never wrong), committed themselves to peace, and on the suggestion of the Abeokuta delegates, who told them it was the source of the White man’s strength, accepted the Alaafin as their constitutional monarch, something called democracy and themselves as one.In East Africa, Tewodros II re-establishes centralised control in Ethiopia. His battles with the Ethiopian Church over clerical privileges lose him their support, and his disastrous foreign policy ends in a British invasion, during which he commits suicide. He is succeeded by Yohannes IV, who defeats two Egyptian invasions, but dies defeating an invasion from the Mahdi. His successor Menelik II #reaches a pact with Ismail, Muhammad Ali’s successor. They delineate their borders, the Coptic church in Egypt is once more allowed to dispatch Abunas to Ethiopia, Menelik is granted a free hand in the coastal regions of the Horn of Africa, Ismail sends military advisers to aid this prospect, Menelik lends Ismail troops to aid his bloody pacification of the lower Sudan, and more Arab tribes are encouraged to migrate southwards. Stuck between the two cooperating states, the dissident tribes of the region are all but destroyed, with the remainder bound to the land, with much of the marshes of South Sudan turned to cotton fields to make up for the drop in supply during the American civil war.From the Zanzibar islands, Sayyid Said asserts control over the city-states of the East African littoral. #In the interior, the rising power of Buganda pushes its old overlord Bunyoro inwards, into the present day DRC. Egyptian engineer and explorer, AbdelRahman Amr, in a special project for the Khedive, discovers the source waters of the Nile. This magnificent scientific achievement inspires the formation of Nile Congress, a diplomatic congress modelled on its European counterpart. In the wake of the diplomatic congress, follow British, French and Egyptian industrialists. The East African interior is fully opened to commerce, a rail line from Alexandria to Mogadishu is completed. The Suez Canal is constructed, increasing Egypt’s strategic value and diplomatic standing. An invitation to the European Congress follows…In Southern Africa, the Great Trek and the Mfecane end with antagonistic states across the region, but two supreme; The Zulu and the Afrikaans. The Mfecane equally leads to the formation of the different states of Central Africa.The 19th century equally sees the unification of Madagascar.#As the 19th ended, the borders of the states of Africa had roughly emerged. Most were sprawling, empires covering millions of square miles. Central Africa was the exception, the Mfecane had led to the formation there, of a collective of small states, jealous of their independence, keen to play off the Zulu behemoth on their southern flanks against the Kongo to their West, and the Rozwi and Bunyoro neighbours to their East. Egypt was the most advanced, stretching from Syria, across the Arabian peninsula, all the way down to a border she shared with Ethiopia, Bunyoro and Buganda. Possessing a brown water navy, but a first-class army, it was the continent’s undoubted hegemon.The 19th century equally saw the entrance of Christian missionaries, invited in West Africa by the Saro and heading up from Southern Africa via the Cape. These, of which the most famous were David Livingstone, Henry Townsend and Samuel Ajayi Crowther converted many, and most importantly, played a role in the mitigation of the internal slavery. Bible, plough and #Adam Smith tracts in hand, they were able to convince the monarchs of the region that the plantation systems they were using to meet the commodities demand of the legitimate trade was not effective. The collapse of slavery in Europe, and then post the civil war, in the Americas, in addition to diplomatic pressures led to wholesale manumissions of slaves across the continent.#The key events of the 20th century. Being cognizant of the fact that I’m 3,000 words in… bullet points galore!WW1• #The African nations due to the virtue of proximity have friendlier relations with the Western European powers. Plus Egypt emerged as a rival to Turkey’s caliphal authority. WW1 plays out same old, except instead of Lawrence of Arabia, you get Lawrence of Egypt. Rather than Arab tribes and guerrilla actions, you have a third front and a modern army. Egypt sides with the Entente, in a two front war, and with Egypt advancing from Syria, Gallipoli likely works. Ataturk’s Turkey is dismembered by the Allies and the Greeks, with all the tension that will cause in the hypothetical future. Egypt gets Iraq for her troubles. Without the colonial levies, the European powers, however, suffer more casualties, their anger at Germany leads to Versailles. The Russian revolution still happens.• #The depression and the examples of the USSR triggers a series of attempted Marxist revolutions in the Dahomey and Zulu states (the historically most autocratic). The suppression by state and allied authorities is brutal. Hitler comes to power. During the Spanish civil war, Morocco pounces on her contested territories with Spain. Mussolini deterred from an invasion of Ethiopia by the Nile Congress, binds himself closer to Hitler, thus the Axis.• #WW2. Same old-same old. Caveats: coming to power on revanchist lines, the fascist Franco sides with the Axis, pushing Morocco into the allied camp. War ends with the• #Egypt gets France’s seat on the UN Security council. The Free French are forced to fight from the British Isles.• #No State of Israel. Just no way I can see it happening. Israel was brought into existence by the hands of Israelis, its survival assured in the face of invasion by multiple Arab states. In this scenario, it would instead have to contend with a unified state, a winner in two world wars, a UN Security Council member and the world’s oil superpower. I get the sense that given a choice between oil and Israel, oil wins. The Jews of the region stay Egyptian citizens.• Cold War increases American influence across the continent. The Autocratic regimes of the continent side with America against the Soviet revolutionaries. American influence, however, aids market, if not political liberalisation.• Apartheid remains the official policy of the Afrikaans Republic. This triggers a full-scale migration of blacks to black majority states in the region. Tension is palpable in one of the new world’s trouble spots.• Cold War ends…The End of History.The 21st century isHashtags are meant to indicate alternative history scenarios.

This is true for three reasons: (i) mental health has reached crisis status, (ii) mental health is a booming area of medical research with high levels of tech transfer from academic labs, and (iii) brain technology is benefiting greatly from tech advances in other fields.Mental Health Crisis1 in 5 American adults experience a mental illness. [1] [2] This number is likely to be higher in developing nations. If you live past the age of 60 you have a nearly 30% chance of being killed by some form of dementia.  [3]The prevailing theory used to posit that alleviating socioeconomic hardships would drive down all diseases; while this is true for many diseases of the last century, by virtue of longer life-spans other diseases have emerged, most famously: dementia. Other mental health challenges are also on the rise—Those suffering from Autism Spectral Disorder make up approximately 1 in 132 individuals (and growing) [4], 1–3 of every 100 will experience epileptic seizures in their lifetime,  [5]and a whopping 1 in 10 with mood disorders [6].Biomedical Research: Focus on the BrainIn 2011 nearly a quarter of the National Institutes of Health $32B budget went to ‘neurosciences’ related projects.  [7]The proportion of brain work through this agency has bloomed following new initiatives focusing on breakthrough technological advances from the field [8].While some areas of basic research have legitimate reasons to complain about stagnating funding, medical research cannot. The NIH currently provides 50% greater funding than it did in the year 2000. Much of this growth has occurred in brain research. That being said, it is also easy to say that it isn’t enough to meet the demand and needs of those afflicted with debilitating disease. When the quality of life of 1 in 5 humans is on the line, mental health issues should continue to take a front and center position among public policy issues.

I had diagnosed chronic depression, anxiety, insomnia, and I was perpetually miserable.But, for some reason, for some unbelievable reason, I was drawn to him that morning.I had to ask him what was wrong. If everything was okay. If he was well.I walked up to him, and said, “Bhaiya, what's wrong?”His eyes.There was something about them. They were eyes I'd seen before — eyes that'd look back at me every time I'd look in the mirror.Eyes that had no trace of hope in them. Eyes that only the broken and beaten carry.He just cried without a single word.I walked inside his auto and I sat down.I gave him some time. He needed me there but he just didn't want to trouble me.I waited for what felt like an eternity, and then he finally told me, “I don't want to live anymore. I'm going to kill myself today. You're the last person I'm talking to.”I said nothing but motioned for him to pass me the bottle of alcohol.Then I took a long drink, and told him to turn the auto to the liquor shop.Four hours — I was with him for four hours that day.I'd drink and he'd drink and he'd tell me about his life.He'd lived a miserable existence. His story makes me tear up even today, this moment, as I write this.The one person — the only person who could see past this lonely alcoholic auto driver that the world could see — to come to love him — recently died.His heart — was shredded to bits. There was nothing he had that he could live for. He'd made his decision.He was going to kill himself.Those four hours passed by in a second.I barely said a word.One bottle of rum after another was opened and we drank — then we got more — and drank more.Words came out of him — one after another — until his chest started to feel less and less heavy with each passing second.My friends walked by and saw me sit in a auto with a lowly auto-driver and drink and they gave me the same look the world gave him.I just didn't leave. I couldn't bring myself to.I was fixated on him — and I didn't know how — but I had to help him somehow.Four hours later, he wiped his tears and said, “Now I'm going to live for you. You saved my life.”That night as I went home drunk out of my mind after saying goodbye, I puked.Then I cried, drank the last of the alcohol I had, and then I puked again to pass out on the floor in a sea of tears and puke.I missed my exam the next morning.One year later, one lonely, miserable night I'd try to kill myself.My best friend would call him because she just didn't know what else to do. She was helpless and she couldn't trust my friends to see me like this.She called him, and he begged to talk to me and I said, “No, bhaiya. This is it. Goodbye.”Seconds passed....then minutes....and the bell rang and my best friend ran to the door because she was afraid to leave me alone.There he stood.Not many people know this, but that night he was there.Fighting with me. Crying with me. Begging me. Asking me to choose to live. He begged, literally begged.He told me, as I couldn't keep my eyes open, that I was the reason he was alive — he just couldn't let me do it.He'd not be able to live with himself.He had a huge part to play as to why I'm alive today.There's something I didn't know that night.When my best friend called him, he was having dinner.Just as soon as he heard that I was going to kill myself, he left his dinner, and he stole his father's auto keys since his had no fuel.His father saw him, and thinking he was going to drink again, he tried to snatch the keys away from him, for them to fight.Yes, they fought.Then, along the way, he'd drive so fast that he'd crash into the divider some distance away from my house.There was a huge dent in his auto that night.He risked his life — and he lived miles away from me.To give you an accurate example, he reached my home within nine minutes — a distance that is almost impossible to cover on any given night.That's how fast he drove.Then, he was here.At my door.To fight for me, with me.A lonely auto driver who I'd spent four hours with on the day he wanted to kill himself.What's the closest thing to magic that actually exists?Kindness — how it magically makes its way back to you.","20,148 followers",Aitijya Sarkar,8.8K,209,11.5M,2019,https://www.quora.com/If-we-kept-the-major-events-of-the-last-500-years-industrialization-exploration-colonialism-world-wars-advanced-technology-and-the-Internet-etc-but-replaced-the-major-players-with-African-culture-and-nations-how-would-the-world-be-different-today

I cannot do anything about it, but what is in my control, is how I choose to let or not let their dumbfuckery define my life.When you bear grudges against people who hurt you, you allow them to take up space in your life. The moment you disassociate from them, saying that “ This person is toxic for me, and I need to stand up for myself now, I need to protect myself now"", you remove them out of your picture. The moment you do that, its over. Now whether they die, or live, or get punished or instead flourish, is none of your business, because its not your picture. Yes, there is a feeling of vindication, when you see someone who hurt you suffer, and pay for their actions , directly or indirectly, I will not deny that. But that joy never lasts long term. Because Karma is not about them. Karma is about you and your picture. Karma is going through absolute shit hell, and coming back right up like a queen.I am of course, not talking about legal cases.When I was going through my divorce, which itself is a painful process altogether, thats what I told myself.THIS IS MY PICTURE.THIS IS MY PICTURE.THIS IS MY PICTURE.And only me, and the people I love and care about are in that picture.Assholes, Out.This is the day I found out my ex husband was sleeping around with multiple women. The world seemed to come to an end, with everything crashing around me.And this is me, two years later, back on my feet, a published author, several writing projects in hand, going to hospital and doing my duties as a doctor all through the pandemic, teaching undergrad students, and living my life to the fullest, without holding back.This is my Karma. That I got my life back, despite hitting rock bottom. That the world seemed to end, except it didn't. That I got closer to where I want to be, in life. That I became the woman I always wanted to be. And that I could smile again, laugh again, live again, be Me again.They say Karma is a bitch. Thats true. Karma is that bitch who says “ Hey I am not letting you give up. You and me, we are gonna get through this and we are gonna rock”.",UNKNOWN,Pallavi,15.1K,495,8.9M,2021,https://www.quora.com/If-we-kept-the-major-events-of-the-last-500-years-industrialization-exploration-colonialism-world-wars-advanced-technology-and-the-Internet-etc-but-replaced-the-major-players-with-African-culture-and-nations-how-would-the-world-be-different-today

Andy Mawson, director of operations at GNAAS, came up with the idea and described seeing it as ""awesome"".He said it meant a paramedic could ""fly"" to a fell top in 90 seconds rather than taking 30 minutes on foot. Mr Mawson said: ""There are dozens of patients every month within the complex but relatively small geographical footprint of the Lakes.The test flight was carried out by Richard Browning, founder of Gravity Industries. He said the suits had two mini engines on each arm and one on the back allowing the paramedic to control their movement just by moving their hands. ""The biggest advantage is its speed,"" Mr Mawson said. ""If the idea takes off, the flying paramedic will be armed with a medical kit, with strong pain relief for walkers who may have suffered fractures, and a defibrillator for those who may have suffered a heart attack. ""In a jet pack, what might have taken up to an hour to reach the patient may only take a few minutes, and that could mean the difference between life and death.""The following was the previous ‘wow’ moment:On July 14 last year (according to Quora that is), I answered the question: ““How about a piece of gear that permits the totally blind to see again? The word 'revolutionary' appears in the question, and if anything is revolutionary, by the gods this is it. The invention on which I am about to write has just been revealed. However, it is a rather complicated piece of kit, and I would imagine that it must surely have taken longer than the months of this year already elapsed in order to have been brought the thing to fruition. In the circumstances therefore, perhaps we can overlook the '2018' stipulation in the query and cut to the chase.The device is Orion wireless technology and has been developed by surgeons from Baylor Medical College in Texas and the University of California. It is almost miraculous in that it can give totally blind people back their sight. So, folks who have gone blind through, infections, trauma, autoimmune diseases, nerve problems, glaucoma and so on, will be able to see again. It is at the time of writing, unclear, if individuals actually been born blind, will benefit from the invention. The reason for the foregoing being, that the brain - or rather the visual cortex - will never have learned how to process images in the first instance.The revolutionary aspect of the device is, that the patient's eyes have no role whatsoever to play in the seeing process. They are in fact completely bypassed. It works like this. Electrode chips are planted in the visual cortex at the back of the skull. The patient then dons a pair of glasses mounted with a tiny video camera, which in turn, relays images to the electrode chips, thereby enabling the subject to see again.To conclude, one of the neurosurgeons involved in implanting the Orion system is professor Daniel Yoshor of Baylor, and the company manufacturing the kit is a small American Firm called 'Second Sight'. It should be remembered that these are very early days in the experiments. Nevertheless, they provide the hope of a fantastic future, for tens, if not hundreds of millions of blind people throughout world.”I suppose that it is an invention really rather than an innovation, but who is going to complain at such a marvelous procedure.",25 followers,Saranya Ravichandran,1.6K,311,39.1M,2021,https://www.quora.com/With-advanced-technology-in-the-future-do-you-think-studying-in-a-specific-subject-will-be-near-meaningless-regarding-careers-Since-mostly-everything-will-be-done-by-computers

Empty and deserted.We parked the bike and sat on these rocks as my friend lit a cigarette and I played some music.Then there was silence.Nothing but silence with my phone playing Floyd in the background.It was just perfect.Until, we heard it.A desperate, wailing scream.It'd been fifteen minutes by then.My friend and I were talking, when we heard this loud, screeching noise from far away.Both of us heard it.I thought it was my friend's phone. My friend thought it was my alarm or ringtone.Together, we shifted, uncomfortably, but we don't say anything just yet.Then, we heard it again.This time, louder. Closer. Felt like someone was running towards us.I looked at my friend as he looked at me.I said, “Umm, bro, was that your phone?”He looks at me, equally perplexed, and says, “Wait, I thought it was yours. Please don't joke about this.”I said, “I'm not! Wait, did you hear that too?”He says, “Yeah, I did. I thought.....”Before he could finish, we hear it again.Some girl, or something, screaming at the top of her voice.This time, it was even louder. Even closer.

It wasn't stopping.Something or someone was screaming and with each passing second that thing was coming closer.It was a terrible sound.It was a sound that felt so eerie and unnatural. Utterly miserable. One devoid of hope. Uncanny.There was nothing around.No house. No one. No body.It was desolate for miles and miles.Not a single soul in sight.But, the scream.With each second, running towards us, louder, closer.Within seconds, we run to my friend's bike.He fires up the engine.By now, the screaming is extraordinarily real. It felt like the thing or person was desperately close to us by now.I jumped on the backseat as he immediately revs his bike.It was an on road bike — there was rubble and an offshoot of a gravel road that had to be crossed before we were on the main road.We didn't care.He revved his bike and within three seconds we were doing 50 km/per hour.He was just about to lose his balance and fall but now the screaming felt just seconds away from us.We couldn't stop.Scream.I say, “Go go go man.”Scream.He says, “Fuck, man. It's getting closer.”Scream.I say, “Bhai, I'm serious. We need to leave. Just drive. Just drive. Don't look to your left. Just don't.”Scream.Seconds away from us now.I looked to my left and finally saw it.A figure — something — or someone.But, not a human. That thing, wasn't human. The moon cast it's magnificent light over that thing and it was fully clothed in bright, shining, white.It was still screaming and it was running straight at us. Right at us. Not kidding, literally running towards us.I am shaking now and desperately I tell my friend, “Don't fucking look to your left. Just drive.”We'd just made it to the main road by now as he revved to take us quickly away.I didn't even look back to see where that thing was now.Both of us were shaking by the time we reached — literally shaking — almost in tears.That night, neither of us slept.The next morning, we went to college.One of our friends was from Pune — a localite.We were telling him the story, all of it, and he looks at us with this weird face. One of horror. Utter, sheer horror.It was strange because this guy didn't even believe in ghosts or the supernatural.Just as we finished our story, he asks, quietly, “Wait, which lake was this?”I say, “There's one close to Lohegaon. Do you know it?”That's when he says something that chills us to the core and knocked the breath out of us.He says, “Bhai, that's the infamous suicide lake.”Shaking now, I asked, “What do you mean?”He says, “It'sI've never doubted in the existence of the supernatural, since.","1,189 followers",Louis Juliot,1K,7.1K,9.3M,2019,https://www.quora.com/With-advanced-technology-in-the-future-do-you-think-studying-in-a-specific-subject-will-be-near-meaningless-regarding-careers-Since-mostly-everything-will-be-done-by-computers

The men of the tribe go out, hunt down an animal, kill it, and then they spend a few hours cleaning the animal and cooking it while everyone gathers around to be social as the sun sets and everyone gets ready to sleep. This was a great improvement on life before, where meat was eaten raw and could lead to disease and parasites. Cooking let our ancestors eat meat that was safer and more easily digested, and we discovered smoking which let us keep food longer. So did we improve on fire? You bet we did.It took a while but eventually we discovered the cob oven, which used mud to help contain the heat and, by extension, use less fuel to do more cooking. It was this that helped early man start to take those strange grasses that grew up everywhere and someone figured out that you could grind those grasses up into a kind of cereal. That was good, but oh no, some wound up in some water and began to rot. That’s not good. We’d better throw it out but… oh it smells strange. Hmm. I’ll just do a quick taste test and… wow that’s good stuff.It’s no surprise that beer and bread have been around a long time. Yeast and fermentation together made a kind of high calorie drink that was served to workers on projects like the pyramids. It kept them going and got them a little bit tipsy, which is never a bad thing when working in the sun all day. Plus, alcohol could be used to make water safer to drink by killing off bacteria. So now you have easily digested foods, safer drinks, warmth, what else can we do with this fire stuff?Metals baby. Unlike stone and wood, metals are much more durable but are a huge pain to get out of the ground. Still, they were useful and made tools stronger and more durable, and were nice and shiny. People like shiny things. So now your ax or spear will retain its point better or, if it does get bent, can at least be mended instead of looking for a new rock or stick. It also has the added benefit of being fashioned into jewelry, art, and coins, making it great for trading.All of this of course led to civilization around the world. Some technologies are dangerous of course, but ultimately technology isn’t evil, it’s just a tool that has helped mankind prosper. The problems we face because of technology are radically different than a caveman, and the problems our children have will be different than ours. It’s how we use technology that is important, and if we hope to overcome problems, we need to explore options and see where we can find new tools built on the foundations of those that got us here in the first place.",2 followers,Thomas Cayne,4.6K,1.3K,189.3M,2019,https://www.quora.com/With-advanced-technology-in-the-future-do-you-think-studying-in-a-specific-subject-will-be-near-meaningless-regarding-careers-Since-mostly-everything-will-be-done-by-computers

38,"Would an alien civilization progress through technology the same way humans have?They sure would!They wouldn’t necessarily make all the same discoveries at all the same times. It would depend on a lot of factors, not least of which would be the chemical composition of their planet.But something akin to the Industrial Revolution does seem inevitable for any creature that evolves the physical ability to manipulate their own environment.For example, it’s unlikely that whales would ever have an industrial revolution, no matter how intelligent they were. They simply don’t have the hands for it.

They simply don’t have the hands for it. And in fact, it’s likely that whales are not only slightly, butBut for any creature with hands, it’s very likely that an evolutionary increase of intelligence would be accompanied by an eventual Industrial Revolution, in which many discoveries would be made, and large-scale environmental manipulation would occur.The thing that I believe would be “the same” among all species in the universe, is not the precise order of discoveries, but theThe pace of discovery and invention has been increasing at what seems to be an exponential rate. Earth is sort of like a Star Trek episode where the nanobots suddenly achieve sentience and move beyond the need of any spaceship or physical form. The graph of human discovery was a flat line for a very long time, and now it’s nearly vertical.All species in the universe who achieve an Industrial Revolution, would likewise see this exponential increase in discovery and invention.An implication of this is that all of the dangers and existential threats to that lifeform would tend to arrive all at once, at nearly exactly the same time. And this is what we’re seeing in the case of humanity as well. We can list off on our fingers all the horrifying existential threats that have come about in just the previous one or two generations — nuclear bombs; climate change; drug-resistant bacteria; artificial intelligence; and the list goes on.It’s no coincidence that this is all happening at once, and allConsider Earth: we face climate catastrophe, and yet our entire system of economic developmentThe same must be true on other worlds. Eventually, at exactly the same moment as discovery begins to hit the vertical line, all the dangers and unplanned-for consequences of that species’ previous development must also simultaneously come to a head. It stands to reason: if you do anythingThe bad news is that this fulcrum point in history is probably also the reason why we find no evidence of life elsewhere in the universe. It is probablyThe good news is, if any lifeformTheir planet would undoubtedly become very healthy, an oasis of diversity and abundance, because they would finally understand the",4 followers,Dan Bradbury,635,21.7K,235.5M,2020,https://www.quora.com/If-we-kept-the-major-events-of-the-last-500-years-industrialization-exploration-colonialism-world-wars-advanced-technology-and-the-Internet-etc-but-replaced-the-major-players-with-African-culture-and-nations-how-would-the-world-be-different-today
