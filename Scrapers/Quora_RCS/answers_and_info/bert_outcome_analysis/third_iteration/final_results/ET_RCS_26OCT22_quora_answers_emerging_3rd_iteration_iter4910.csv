0,"Some possible technologies that could replace 5G include 6G, millimeter wave technology, and Li-Fi. Each of these technologies has its own advantages and disadvantages, so it is difficult to say which one will eventually become the standard. It is likely that several different technologies will be used to replace 5G in the future, depending on the specific needs of each application.","9,879 followers",Kenzi Mudge,1.8K,1.3K,8.3M,2022,https://www.quora.com/What-technology-will-replace-the-Internet-5G-in-the-future

5,"A phone camera has an aperture of perhaps 3 millimeters. That means if the lens and sensor are perfect, it can achieve 167 microradians of resolution.Consider a DSLR with a 2000 mm focal length lens. It can resolve 2 microradians.OK, so you don’t know what that means. I grabbed my phone camera and my 12 year old modest DSLR with kit lens and took a picture under good conditions. Hand held.Cell phone.DSLR. So far, so good. But let’s take a closer look.I zoomed in on the sign in the picture. This is what the cellphone did. It has 32 megapixels.I did the same digital zoom with my DSLR. Mind you,A phone camera has an aperture of perhaps 3 millimeters.

It has 32 megapixels.I did the same digital zoom with my DSLR. Mind you, it only has 18 megapixels. There are a couple of take aways here. With the tiny lens, all those megapixels do not get you a clearer picture. And the cellphone picture is very highly processed to look sharper when it just doesn’t have the detail you would expect from so many pixels. If you are really sharp you will notice that the DSLR did not automatically hide the chromatic aberration in the above picture. That is something usually done in post processing on the computer.Now, I just rotated my zoom lens to a longer focal length and took another picture.You still think that a cellphone image matches up to a DSLR?Look at this building in the cell phone.It’s pretty unrecognizable and the phone went basically to black and white.Here is the DSLR. Can you argue that the cell phone is anywhere near professional quality when we are comparing to a new phone to a twelve-year-old starter DSLR APS-C frame with a kit lens? A flagship Canon full frame DSLR with a prime lens would blow even the bottom picture away. By the way, I did not do any processing on the DSLR images and I have the camera set for minimal sharpening and minimal noise reduction and output jpeg files. If I had taken raw images into Photoshop, the difference would be another quantum leap.Or, in other words, if all you ever want to do is take snapshots for social media, your cellphone is all you need. Wait until balloon fiesta and I’ll show you some comparison photos.I am actually a little surprised that the phone camera came as close as it did. The thing third from left in top row is a balloon gondola shape. The green and black thing is a German screwdriver.Image credit:","5,360 followers",Valerio Cietto,677,2.4K,9.1M,2022,https://www.quora.com/What-advanced-futuristic-technology-will-replace-the-smartphone-in-many-years-from-now
6,"It is a futuristic question, but let me try to answer it -A) Wave 1 (2017–2018) - The first wave of transformation is already happening. Augumented Reality (AR) will soon become a central aspect of smartphone applications (apps make the phone ""smart""). For example - Navigation and tracking would be transformed through AR as opposed to the traditional ways of using the maps applications.B) Wave 2 (2018–2020) - The form factor of smartphones would change. With foldable screens already available - it is a matter of time when foldable phones would be available in the market - making it easy for coIt is a futuristic question, but let me try to answer it -A) Wave 1 (2017–2018) - The first wave of transformation is already happening. Augumented Reality (AR) will soon become a central aspect of smartphone applications (apps make the phone ""smart""). For example - Navigation and tracking would be transformed through AR as opposed to the traditional ways of using the maps applications.B) Wave 2 (2018–2020) - The form factor of smartphones would change. With foldable screens already available - it is a matter of time when foldable phones would be available in the market - making it easy for consumers.Edit on 24/3/2019 - Foldable smartphones have been announced in 2019 as predicted. See link for more details -C) Wave 3 (2020–2025) - Multiple form factors will become available and would eventually replace the way we know the phone today. A smartphone would no longer look like a phone. Wearable glasses, watches, and even Virtual Reality (VR) devices would become ubiquitous. It will be difficult to completely replace the ""phone"" due to our conditioning - but slowly the usage of the phone would get replaced by wearables.D) Wave-4 (2025–2035) - The phone will eventually shrink and become an accessory (dumb phone) to our primary wearable devices. It will be used mostly to project the screen on surfaces (holograms and AR). The primary use case would be to consume content and to use the phone for using business applications. For example, the holograms would project themselves such as screens to play videos, or as a projected laptop screen and logical keyboard for typing, or even as a large screen to give presentations. Other use cases would be to use the phone as a digital wallet for initiating Point of Sale (PoS) payments.E) Wave-5 (2035–2050): The ""phone"" will become "" super smart"". By this time, the wearable devices would have replaced the phone completely and will be equipped with Artifical General Intelligence (AGI) and not just normal AI. The processing needed for AGI will be partially subsumed in chipsets of the wearables, while the rest of the processing will be in the cloud. The phone would no longer be just a communications device which provides us with apps. It will embibe our persona, and would become an alter-ego - helping us to perform daily tasks, and even talk to people on our behalf, and acting as our personal assistant.Just my two cents. Technology always surprises us, and it remains to be seen what happens in the future.","5,990 followers",Jens Böttiger,566,2.6K,17.6M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-advanced-futuristic-technology-will-replace-the-smartphone-in-many-years-from-now
