Let me explain. Most attempts at fusion use a toroid design (a big donut shape) with the ionized gas being accelerated by large electromagnets around the outside.While this process does turn some of that gas to plasma, meaning a dissociated jumble of ions, it does not turn all of it to plasma. That is problem number one. The second problem is that a plasma now is filled with charged particles that have, you guessed it, their own little magnetic fields. This means that they mess with the other ions in unpredictable and unwanted ways. This lack of uniformity means that you need to have bigger and more expensive magnets to push them back in line and behave. This means that you need a bigger reactor and more power to get the thing going.The last factor that makes size a big deal is just the...",457 followers,Jason Heinisch,1K,1.2K,2.2M,2021,https://www.quora.com/How-far-are-we-from-building-our-first-fusion-reactor

I’m not saying that this is accurate because I’m not a nuclear engineer either, and I hope I can get some feedbacks from people who actually understand this.Since vibranium is not actually a real element, I’m focusing on the old arc reactor tech that runs on palladium.Let’s do a bit revision on fusion, yes? During nuclear fusion, light atoms combine to form heavier elements; in the process, a small fraction of mass is converted into lots of energy. Fusion reactions are called thermonuclear reactions because high temperatures are required to overcome the coloumbic repulsion between the nuclei being fused, i.e., “thermo” for the heat required and “nuclear” for the interactions that occur.Basically, what Bruce said!The fusion reaction occurs when the fuel (two types, or isotopes, of hydrogen known as deuterium and tritium) combines to form a super-hot plasma which produces, alongside the helium, neutrons which have a huge amount of kinetic energy. Sounds like the arc reactor!Many articles relate the arc reactor with cold fusion because of the use of palladium as the cathode. Wiki: Cold fusion is a hypothetical type of nuclear reaction that would occur at, or near, room temperature, compared with temperatures in the millions of degrees that is required for “hot” fusion. Cold fusion is not exactly a true fusion reaction. Stanley Pons and Martin Fleischmann achieved this cold fusion on a tabletop in 1989, but if it was a true fusion reaction, everyone in that room could’ve died from the radiation emitted. I think it’s safe to say that iron man’s arc reactor does not emit any kind of ionizing radiation (other than easily stopped alpha and beta) because tony would’ve been more worried about radiation poisoning than palladium poisoning.More recent theories (2005) through a complex interaction of hydrogen and a host metal (The article was long and boring but it has images of the supposedly fusion reactor:It’s huge, probably just like the one they had in Stark Industries? The scientists who tried to copy tony’s miniature reactor couldn’t do it, and we’re also not tony stark, so maybe we haven’t figured out how to miniaturized it yet.The reactor contained a pinch of powdered nickel (or palladium as I’ve mentioned before), a puff of hydrogen gas, and a dash of a secret catalyst. When the mixture was heated with an electrical current, a mysterious reaction occurred, generating large amounts of excess heat. The heat boiled water into steam. The steam could be used to spin a turbine to make electricity. Just like normal fission reactors. I don’t know how tony did this part.Some people relate the arc reactor to a tokamak reactor. Wiki: A tokamak is a deviceAt first I disagree with these people because I thought the reactor was used to power up the electromagnet used to stop the shrapnels from moving towards his heart? But remember when pepper helped him install the upgraded reactor and she pulled the exposed copper wire along with the magnet? And then she just put in the new reactor by touching the wire to the base plate?But then I found this:The movie interchangeably refer to the device as keeping the shrapnel out of his heart and keeping it beating. The latter is supported by both this scene and the comment by Dr. Yinsen that the arc reactor could “run (his) heart for fifty lifetimes. The opening exposition in the cave explaining the danger of the shrapnel explains that it takes ""about a week” for it to kill its subjects. Given how fast he started dying both in the scene with the copper ring and when Obadiah forcibly removed the arc reactor, it’s entirely possible that the system is also acting as an admittedly very fancy pacemaker.The copper coil is left over from when Tony threw together the miniature ARC reactor during his time as a captive. Since the ARC reactor functions as a powerful electromagnet to keep the shrapnel out of his chest, it can be assumed that the copper coil is really just there to act as a residual magnet if and when the main unit needs replacing. Since Pepper pulled it out and Tony didn’t have a spare copper coil on hand, he went into cardiac arrest. It’s really just there so he doesn’t go into cardiac arrest every time he needs to replace his chest piece. I’m sure he pops a new copper coil in there later on.So, Tokamak basically is a doughnut-shaped chamber used in fusion research in which a plasma is heated and confined by magnetic fields. The basic shape of tokamak actually resembles the arc reactor, and the little circle of blue light should be plasma. The huge arc reactor in the first movie could be a fancy looking tokamak, I think., BUT there is no place for palladium (or vibranium) in this reactor, from what I understand.More about tokamak:A tokamak produces a doughnut-shaped plasma. To do so it employs its strongest currents to produce the largest magnetic fields through its toroidal coils looped perpendicularly around the doughnut ring. A current is induced in the plasma from high currents in the poloidal (or horizontal) coils in the middle of the doughnut shape producing its own magnetic field. The combined effect creates a helical magnetic field. To induce the current in the plasma fields a changing current is required in the poloidal coils, therefore producing a more pulsed plasma response.This simply means that the tokamak needs power to create the fusion reaction. This is where it differs from tony’s arc reactor.And then there’s the problem with the cooling system. The suit may have a sophisticated system but if you look at the one from the caves, it has a tiny fan at the back for cooling. But the reactor should produce a lot of heat from the thermonuclear reaction that needs coolant like water or molten lead. So when tony is not wearing the suit, where does the heat go? Must not be very nice to be near him with all that heat. I mean, Tony is hot but literally hot…? I don’t think so.I think that’s it! Most people had the same theory so it goes back to cold fusion and tokamak, while non scientific discussions just speculate everything vaguely. If there’s anything inaccurate, just point it out! Maybe there are info from the comics or movies that I missed out? And if you have any question, just ask.Footnotes:-Vibranium is not entirely fictional. Irl it can be produced using cyclotrons, or circular particle accelerators, like the one tony built in his house, that can smash atoms together to generate heavier elements. But it is an unstable element that decays immediately. Most probably not glowy and in the plasma state that tastes like coconut and metal.-Palladium has many isotopes. Not all of them are radioactive. I don’t think tony used the radioactive isotope for his reactor because in the caves, he got the palladium from the weapon components, so it cannot be radioactive.-Please don’t start with the 3 gigajoule per second energy it produces because even nuclear power plants irl cant produce that much energy.-and the repulsors! They don’t obey newton’s third law for flying, sorry. There aren’t much discussion on the repulsors but there are plasma based military weapon in the making?

Once Fuel Rods are spent, they must be disposed of carefully. There is a facility in Texas which stores the Nuclear waste deep underground. The Fukushima Daiichi Reactor in Japan is an example of just how dangerous Fission Reactors can be, in this instance it was caused by an earthquake.Fusion puts out much more electricity, instead of the possibility of making a Fusion reactor just a year ago many were thinking it might take another 30 years before a Fusion Reactor would be ready for the Electrical Grid. But a project collaboration between MIT and the Commonwealth Fusion Systems (a private company), have come up with new materials to make magnets much more powerful, they believe they can have a Fusion Reactor on line within 15 years.Until now every fusion experiment has operated on an energy deficit, making it useless as a form of electricity generation. Fusion works on the basic concept of forging lighter elements together to form heavier ones. When hydrogen atoms are squeezed hard enough, they fuse together to make helium, liberating vast amounts of energy in the process. However, this process produces net energy only at extreme temperatures of hundreds of millions of degrees Celsius – hotter than the center of the sun and far too hot for any solid material to withstand.To get around this, scientists use powerful magnetic fields to hold in place the hot plasma – a gaseous soup of subatomic particles – to stop it from coming into contact with any part of the doughnut-shaped chamber. However a newly available superconducting material – a steel tape coated with a compound called yttrium-barium-copper oxide, or YBCO – has allowed scientists to produce smaller, more powerful magnets. And this potentially reduces the amount of energy that needs to be put in to get the fusion reaction off the ground.“The higher the magnetic field, the more compactly you can squeeze that fuel.” Prof Howard Wilson, a plasma physicist at York University who works on different fusion projects, said: “The exciting part of this is the high-field magnets.”The planned fusion experiment, called Sparc, is set to be far smaller – about 1/65th of the volume – than that of the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor project, an international collaboration currently being constructed in France.The experimental reactor is designed to produce about 100MW of heat. While it will not turn that heat into electricity, it will produce, in pulses of about 10 seconds, as much power as is used by a small city. The scientists anticipate the output would be more than twice the power used to heat the plasma, achieving the ultimate technical milestone: positive net energy from fusion.

The fusion core emits a large number of fast neutrons, and these neutrons are capable of causing fission in ordinary U-238. So the fusion core in such a bomb is surrounded by U-238, and the induced fission gives about half of the energy. It also gives almost all of the fallout. So in the neutron bomb, this layer is omitted, resulting in much less fallout. The emitted neutrons, which can kill anyone nearby, give the neutron bomb its name.If you are still concerned about what MeV means, it is a unit of energy that is very useful for nuclear reactions. It means “one million eV” where the eV (or “electron volt”) is an energy unit equal to 1.6 x10^-19 joules.","105,674 followers",Dave Consiglio,4.5K,6.8K,91.6M,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-theory-concept-behind-the-Miniature-Arc-Reactor-built-by-Tony-Stark-How-did-it-work

A NIF laser fusion capsule contains only about 0.17 milligrams of Deuterium-Tritium fuel (Basic premise – If the fuel is not inside the reactor, it can’t even theoretically explode inside the reactor or become a factor in an accident).No greenhouse gasses produced -No reactor meltdowns or decay heat burn downs (Chernboyl, Three Mile Island, Fukushima incidents cannot happen)No mining of fuel (fuel is extracted from water)Billions of years of fuel available on earth (versus hundreds for fossil fuels)1/1000ths of the radioactive waste of fission power. Nearly all materials become activated to some degree by energetic neutron bombardment. Neutron reactions in DT fusion reactors will inevitably create radioisotopes. The principal radioactive materials present in a DT or DD fusion reactor will therefore be tritium and neutron activated structural materials surrounding the reaction volume.Radioactive waste, mostly neutron activated fission chamber structural material remains radioactive ~20 years versus hundreds of thousands of years for Minor Actinides in spent fuel produced by fission reactors.. DT fusion reactors would however burn and require storage of significant quantities of Tritium, a moderately radioactive nuclear isotope of hydrogen. Tritium gas is hard to secure and small leaks in reactor tanks and plumbing could result in some loss of tritium to the environment. Tritium decays while emitting weak Beta radiation and under most circumstances is not seriously hazardous to humans. The deuterium-deuterium (DD) fusion process, dispensing with tritium as a fuel and the requirement for Tritium storage. DD fusion does however produce Tritium as part of the DD fusion reaction, but this Tritium does not tend to accumulate but is immediately burned in place inside a DD fusion reactor.Fuel for energy would no longer be a geopolitical issue (huge benefit for humanity)No nuclear weapons from waste products (again, huge benefit for humanity)The nuclear future rightfully belongs to that technology that offers the world the most hope (and then goes forward rapidly to fulfill all of its promises).","29,977 followers",Tomaž Vargazon,6.8K,7.7K,250M,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-theory-concept-behind-the-Miniature-Arc-Reactor-built-by-Tony-Stark-How-did-it-work
