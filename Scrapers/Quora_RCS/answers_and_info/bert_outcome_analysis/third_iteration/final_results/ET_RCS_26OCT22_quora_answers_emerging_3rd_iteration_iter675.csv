Whoever. People on your course, people in your dorm, people on your street, people in your clubs. If this is your first time away from home, then it may well be the first time since kindergarten that everyone around you is looking to make friends, that window won't stay open long.3.a Make friends with people you usually wouldn't. The posh kid might have a holiday home. The computer nerd might have good subscriptions. The theatre kid might have tickets to that concert you want to go to. I'm not saying use people, but I am saying a wide range of friends can open doors.4. Before buying from your usual shops, check charity/ thrift stores. You'd be amazed by what you can find and how little you pay for it, be it a movie for £1 or a pair of jeans for a fiver.5. Coursework is your friend, particularly if you can submit it multiple times. Attendance marks are your friend. Labs are your friend. If you can get 90% on these (which should be pretty easy), and they account for 30% of the grade, then you are halfway to a good grade before you even see an exam paper.6. Don't start smoking. I know three people who already have in the month we've been at uni.

There’s no way a desi grad student in California can afford to go to an Indian restaurant every day; so you bring the food to them instead.On most weekdays it would be something simple like rajma, chole, daal and one veggie. Along with it would be rice and/or frozen rotis (we really didn’t have the space in out 50sq.ft. kitchen to make rotis from scratch).But on weekends, I liked to de-stress in the kitchen.A Biryani meant a clean apartmentSpicy Lamb Chops meant no more dirty dishesRoasted Chicken meant no more grocery shoppingWada Pav or Misal Pav meant no more laundrySo yes, I would spend about 30 minutes a day in the kitchen and in return I’d save almost 2 hours worth of chores. During exam nights, I’d have a line of people outside my apartment at 2am for my “gunshot” coffee to get them through the night. (I don’t drink coffee but can make a mean brew). When friends had folks visiting, we always made it a point to cook something special for them. It was a win-win for everyone. It pays to feed your hungry college friends; they will adore you for life.

This is true for STEM and non-STEM degrees alike.The value of a college education isn’t really about the degree.It’s about two things related to the experience of getting a degree:Do you know why Wharton and Harvard Business Schools are “better” than, say, Ohio State University? It is not that the academics are that much harder. It is not that the professors are that much smarter. It is not that they do better research. Indeed, none of those things are really true.What makes them better is that they have alumni associations that are exceptionally active, wealthy, connected and helpful by comparison.Why does that matter? Because when you say “gosh, I’m looking for a first job, I’d like work at Company A” the next question in your mind should be “Who do I know who works at Company A or who knows someone who does?”If you went to Harvard, you contact the alumni network and start the search and you’ll find someone.If you went to Ohio State, your ability to make that same connection is lower. And that makes the degree less valuable.The key to making your degree valuable isn’t the degree. It’s working hard, even when you don’t want to do so, and being as socially active and engaged as you possibly can.If you do those two things, then you will end up with a degree that you can use to start a career.If you don’t, then every degree is equally without value.",423 followers,David Wagle,852,1.4K,1.8M,2019,https://www.quora.com/How-should-a-college-junior-at-a-top-10-computer-science-school-transition-into-technology-management

9,"No. R&D relies on a healthy interchange of ideas, which is greatly helped by free movement of scientists and other researchers.

10,"I would ask this, if your premise is true and therefore if what Brexiters believe – that it is the EU that has held the UK back. Why did the UK not give ‘a strong boost to R&D in the 1950s and 1960s and become the ‘top world leader in cutting edge technologies’?Why were we in such a dismal state that we didn’t do that? People seem to have completely forgotten why we joined the EEC/EU in the first place.We joined because the Commonwealth was just not a big enough market and we traded more in Europe, and always had, so needed to be there – that is still the case.As to your premise, the UK has alI would ask this, if your premise is true and therefore if what Brexiters believe – that it is the EU that has held the UK back.

We produce cutting edge technology but the products are made elsewhere.Magnetic trains are a good illustration. China is producing very high speed trains using magnetic technology. Japan has built hem since the 1960s. I rememberer a piece on TV when I was a boy about this great new British invention, but as far as I am aware the technology has only been used in the UK for one very short track for about 10 years.Time after time we do not make the most of what we invent and develop, but instead allow others to get the benefit – look at the Harrier for instance.And that is not the fault of the EU. We did it before we were members and while we were members and nothing suggests that we will change our ways.All the problems that Brexiters claim make life for us in the EU untenable seem strangely not to hold Germany back.Because Germany makes stuff people actually want to buy and we do not.
