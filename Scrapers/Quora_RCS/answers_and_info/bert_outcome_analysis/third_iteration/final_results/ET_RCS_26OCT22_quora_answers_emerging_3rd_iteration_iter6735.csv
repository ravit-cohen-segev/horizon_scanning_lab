For instance, some people are more resistant to this novel coronavirus than others, either due to their physical makeup or tendency towards healthy lifestyle choices. This outbreak will tend to weigh the surviving population towards those who have genetically better resistance for one reason or another. That is how evolution works.I’m not trying to be cold towards those suffering. I believe I may have the virus myself, and have an 87 year old father to worry about. I am anxious and upset.

1,"Yes. That started with the discovery of fire and the technology of cooking. Cooking releases more nutrients from food, enabling larger, more nutrient-hungry brains. Agriculture, one of the largest technological innovations in human history, accelerated that trend.Technology has shaped our evolution since the beginning.",0 followers,Claire Jordan,1.1K,45.6K,295.7M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Did-human-beings-stop-evolving-because-of-the-advancement-of-technology
2,"Any tool use is technology.Dairying, the routine keeping of mammals for milk production, is a historically important technology. And in cultures where dairying was developed, we generally see the evolution of lactase persistance — the generation of the enzyme to digest milk sugar long after typical weaning.The opposite, wild-type condition is lactose intolerance. It can be quite unpleasant, because if you don’t digest milk sugar there are bacteria in your gut which will be quite happy to do so — with the concomitant production of copious quantities of gas. So developing lactase persistance botAny tool use is technology.Dairying, the routine keeping of mammals for milk production, is a historically important technology.

It can be quite unpleasant, because if you don’t digest milk sugar there are bacteria in your gut which will be quite happy to do so — with the concomitant production of copious quantities of gas. So developing lactase persistance both enabled obtaining energy from milk and prevented the debilitating issues which occur if the lactose isn’t digested.","105,674 followers",Dave Consiglio,742,6.8K,91.6M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Did-human-beings-stop-evolving-because-of-the-advancement-of-technology
3,"The Marines adapt, and overcome. In fact, as I type this, they’re changing their whole force structure, to be more in line with a new, much more technological set of battle tactics. I just wrote this earlier today, but I’ll say it again; If you want to be a Marine,1: Stop looking for excuses, (like “are they going to be technologically relevant in the future?”) and just get the job done.2: Come up with a plan, and then implement the plan. Here’s the plan:Plan A: Be a Marine.Plan B: There is no Plan B.",180 followers,George Zubaty,6.6K,293,1.1M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Did-human-beings-stop-evolving-because-of-the-advancement-of-technology
4,"Go join the Army.If you are concerned/worried about evolving technology, you're just looking for an excuse to not join the Corps.People who enlist in the Marines want to serve their country. They want to be challenged. They want something, whatever it is, that no one else can offer.You want to be a Marine? You have to be willing to take an order like “ take your knife and attack that tank” .Technology is great but it's not always going to be where and when you want it.There's a reason why Marine tanks don't have backup lights. We don't back up. Full stop.",0 followers,Michael Alva,2.8K,0,0,2020,https://www.quora.com/Did-human-beings-stop-evolving-because-of-the-advancement-of-technology

6,"You go right ahead and join the army snowflake. The marine corps will be here and relevant long after any of us are around. Technology enhances, but does not replace organizations like the marine corps. There are some aspects of large unit fighting that could be partially replaced in the field by tech, but the likelihood is that there will need to be plenty of specialists to support them.","5,775 followers",Al Nolf,1.2K,7.3K,22M,2020,https://www.quora.com/I-want-to-join-the-USMC-but-I-m-afraid-that-the-Marines-won-t-be-relevant-in-the-future-due-to-evolving-technology-I-ll-be-staying-in-for-a-long-time-Should-I-join-anyway-or-should-I-join-the-Army
