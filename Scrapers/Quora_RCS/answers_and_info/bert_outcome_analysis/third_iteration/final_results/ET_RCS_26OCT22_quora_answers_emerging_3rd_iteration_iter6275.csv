0,"Engine combustion technology has evolved considerably each and every decade. The evolution just hasn't been obvious.Over the last 50 years, auto engineers have figured out a lot:How to affordably produce longer-lasting and more reliable engines. It's not at all uncommon for an engine to go 200k miles without requiring any sort of repair. In 1964, it wasn't uncommon for engines to need rebuilds or major overhauls after 20k miles.Engine combustion technology has evolved considerably each and every decade.

It's not at all uncommon for an engine to go 200k miles without requiring any sort of repair. In 1964, it wasn't uncommon for engines to need rebuilds or major overhauls after 20k miles.These advances involved years and years of incremental effort. With only a few exceptions, most of these changes are hard to spot.However, when you consider that engines are smaller, more efficient, more powerful, more reliable, more environmentally friend AND more affordable today than at any point in history, it's hard to argue that engines have not evolved.Perhaps the trouble with evolution in design is that it's not always obvious. Unless you pay close attention to the latest and greatest technology - like Ford's tiny new 3-cylinder 1.0L EcoBoost, which omits a balance shaft (kind of a big deal) - you wouldn't even know that amazing engineering is taking place all around you...",0 followers,Lucas Martin,6.4K,65,4.2M,2014,https://www.quora.com/Despite-the-cutting-edge-technology-in-automobile-design-and-safety-why-has-the-combustion-based-engine-technology-not-evolved

2,It didn't start years ago because servers were much more expensive (Sun Ultra Sparks were alot back then). Today servers are in the cloud and they are peanuts.This peanut theory is indirectly related to miners mining capacity.,"5,085 followers",Bobby Tatro,3.9K,2.2K,45.6M,2015,https://www.quora.com/Why-didnt-blockchain-technology-evolve-15-years-ago
3,"I can tell you one thing and it will not be about the direct innovation that will come.I can guarantee that you will see an increase in Cancer rates by 2022.At first you might think I am crazy, “We are going to Cure Cancer!” and “People are getting healthier and care about their bodies!”.It is very hard to think about how things are now. It requires years of training and metal control to be able to objectively analyze what is still wrongI can tell you one thing and it will not be about the direct innovation that will come.I can guarantee that you will see an increase in Cancer rates by 2022.At first you might think I am crazy, “We are going to Cure Cancer!” and “People are getting healthier and care about their bodies!”.It is very hard to think about how things are now. It requires years of training and metal control to be able to objectively analyze what is still wrong with humanity.Lets start with only 120 years ago.How were things 120 years ago?Please think about this for a moment and once you have your answers lets move to the next step.Next step.How well were new innovations tested before they was used?How well were new innovations in medicine tested? Did humanity test medical advancements before they were wide spread?How well did people test new technology? Did they assume it was inherently safe even without proof? If yes, what could be the fundamental reason to not test it well enough and what happened? There are endless of examples in this one (Leaded fuel, Asbestos, etc).Remember, this was Only about 80 to 120 years ago. Its one persons life that all of that happened.If you answered all the questions with Sources and history to back them up then you probably know why all of that happened.If your conclusion is not the same as mine then I would Love to hear it in the comments, but my conclusion is this:Money, money is the only thing making us keep on going for the Quick deal.It might sound cynical, hell it is. But its also true and History of Humanity is the source.Sure, we will get Nano technology, we will get Gene therapy, we will get Genetically tailored babies, we will get pills to make us younger, thinner and sexier and we will get AI.This is going to cause humanity to suffer in more ways then one.It is already happening in India, China, Pakistan, Russia, Japan, Korea, etc. All of the countries that produce stuff without care for anything except cash.When it comes to money and personal interests there is no Moral Code, there is only subjective, self interest thought.Thing is, there is always a choice and a better way.If you read this far, thank you and I hope it gave you something to think about.“It’s all about the Benjamins” -Puff Daddy",190 followers,Anuj Bhadouriya,901,0,0,2017,https://www.quora.com/Despite-the-cutting-edge-technology-in-automobile-design-and-safety-why-has-the-combustion-based-engine-technology-not-evolved

Who, 5 years ago, predicted that Donald Trump would become POTUS partly because he made use of “Twitter” technology??","246,864 followers",Dushka Zapata,1.5K,8.5K,232.5M,2017,https://www.quora.com/Why-didnt-blockchain-technology-evolve-15-years-ago
5,"If the answers above are the future, I have one thing and one thing only to say to the human race.The future years should not be hallmarked by computer centric innovations. What we need now is computers powering some extra-computer disruption. We've had enough of derivative startups minimizing number of clicks to checkout and calling it a disruption.We need breakthroughs in biology.

(India/Developing nations) ~ More and more SMEs are going to come online, as demonstrated by the 'Chandni Chowk Online' movement where Google brought the SMEs of Chandni chowk onto the web.3. Even more rapid appreciation of Javascript stock, with multiple shots in its arm in the form of HTML5 constructs and real time communication, coupled with the already  existing boost in the form of node.js.4. Influx of the following kind of companies :CollaborationExpect most technologies to move to the web.5.
