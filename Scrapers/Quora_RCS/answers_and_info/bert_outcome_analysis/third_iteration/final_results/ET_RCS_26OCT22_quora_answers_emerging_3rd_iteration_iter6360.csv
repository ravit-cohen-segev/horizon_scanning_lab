They must have existed as something else before they became a collective, and that progenitor race would have had to be exceptionally advanced.

It needs an operator and it must be purchased or built, and operating a drone creates plenty of evidence to use against you.A better question, which I've been pondering a lot lately is: Why don't people understand the basic principles of crime? Why do people think devices enable crime? They don't - criminal people must first have the desire to commit the crime - that's the root problem. Access to devices used in crimes has nothing to do with it. Criminal intent is everything.So that's the bottom line. Even if it was possible to use ""some device"" to remotely attack and kill someone, and even if it could be completely anonymous, you would still need people with the intent of killing each other. If you think lack of access to killing devices is the reason we aren't out there killing each other all the time, then you have some major thinking to do. Access to guns doesn't turn people into murderers, it just doesn't work that way. Access to better killing technology doesn't turn people into criminals. So, the mere existence of such technology wouldn't matter.People in the gun debate need to pay close attention to what I said there. Access to technology does not cause crime, and it doesn't matter how effective the tool is. Most people will not commit crimes, particularly murder, simply because you made it easy. If you think you would, then you need to realize that's a personal problem you have, and if it concerns you, then you should seek counseling.

So Tesla will soon own the technology, the factory space and the ability to monopolize the equipment to make batteries. This could be extremely bad news for battery manufacturers.Note that at the recent Earnings call meeting they said that the semi-truck is stalled from manufacturing because they can’t turn out batteries fast enough - and that the bulk energy storage business is huge and growing.When Elon Musk sees a bottleneck - he attacks it with Piranha-like viciousness.Batteries are a bottleneck.
