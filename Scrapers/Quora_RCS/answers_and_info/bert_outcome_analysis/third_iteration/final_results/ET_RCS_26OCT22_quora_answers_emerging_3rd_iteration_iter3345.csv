India has total of more than 3500 tanks and many more are in the pipeline. Let me explain various battle tanks which are in service with Indian army .ARJUN MK1A and MK2 MBTArjun MK1 is an indigenously build main battle tank of India , it is a 3 rd generation battle tank , it has upgraded recently to MK1A which is a 62.2 tonnes and features a 120 mm main gun, this has got range of more than 450 km ,and has got top speed of 68 km , earlier MK1 had been asked for various improvements by army , and all the 14 proposed upgradations were done by DRDO and came up with MK1A which is now approved by armed forces and placed order for few hundreds for Indian army.ARJUN MK2 is more advanced and entirely a new version of Arjun series, this is much larger tank than the Arjun MK1A with weight of 69 tonnes incorporated with more enhanced features like impact absorbing armoured plate , land mines remover , grenade launchers etc with more enhanced capabilities like more range , more speed etc. It is also equipped with 7 .62 mm coaxial machine gun and another 12.7 mm heavy machine gun on top . Having said that , critics says that the tank is too heavy and required more powerful engine to perform super maneuverability.Arjun tank can accommodate commander , gunner , loader and driver. Unit cost of Arjun tank is about 7.6 million dollars or 55.4 croreT-90 BHISHMAthis is actually a Russian version of T-90 , world's most potent war machine , India signed deal with Russia for transfer of technology .Now this tank is locally produced in India in Tamil Nadu. Initially India purchased 310 T-90 tanks from Russia , later started producing it locally with more upgradation by French technology , this is equipped with 125 mm main gun, can travel at a top speed of 60 km/hr , the tank is powered by 1130 hp diesel engine , it has also got 12.7 mm heavy machine gun . Unit cost of T-90 is 4. 6 million dollarsT-72 AJEYAThis is also a Russian made battle tank called T-72 , India uses its upgraded version called T-72 AJEYA .in the early 1970s India made a deal of purchasing this , India purchased 500 of them in 1978 . It is then later decided to produce domestically, this also got 125 mm main gun , has range of 460 km . It is a 45 tonne tank . It can accommodate commander gunner and driver , unit cost of T-72 is about 1 to 2 million dollars.All the above tanks are the most lethal and legendary in their service. India is expected to prolifer the numbers of tanks in the nearby future .

3,"Short answer is: it depends.Armoured warfare isn't individual combat like Homeretic heroes in the Iliad, but rather a team effort by all members of the Combat Team (Canadian term referring to groupings of Armoured Squadrons and Infantry Companies) and the higher Battlegroup (includes all attachments and enablers, from Engineers and Artillery to Intelligence and Administration).You could be in the best tank with the best crew, and get smoked because an infantry section missed an enemy tank hunting team, or the anti-air artillery unit failed to knock down an enemy drone or attack helicopter.

Your actions could also impact one of the other supporting units as well.That being said, most Western tanks (M1, Leopard 2, LeClerc, Challenger 2) are generally superior to Russian designs because there is much more attention paid to crew ergonomics, and the tanks are physically larger, better armoured and carry more powerful guns. I recall seeing a documentary about the ‚ÄúBattle of 73 Easting‚Äù in the First Persian Gulf War, where the American unit was moving so quickly and attacking on the move that the Iraqi units initially seemed to believe they were under air attack. Post battle analysis also revealed some huge mismatches: the Americans wondered why the Iraqis did not fire, until they ‚Äúwalked‚Äù the battlefield and saw 125mm APDS-FS ‚Äúdarts‚Äù stuck in the desert aprox 1800m from the Iraqi positions. The M1‚Äôs were firing from almost 4000m, and at the Iraqi positions they could see a ‚Äúnotch‚Äù cut through the earthen berms surrounding the Iraqi tanks, followed by the destroyed remains of the Iraqi T-72 (generally with the turret lifted off the tank because of an ammunition explosion within).Destroyed T-55. The picture illustrates the sort of dug in, ‚Äúhull down‚Äù positions the Iraqis were fighting from at 73 EastingWhile a T-90 may have much more advance fire control equipment and ammunition compared to it‚Äôs predecessor, it is essentially an upgraded T-72, with the same cramped interior. Since Russia has no money to build T-14 Armata‚Äôs, they will be using upgraded T-90‚Äôs for years to come.Russian T-90A quick aside should be made for the Turkish Leopard 2‚Äôs that have seemed to be such easy prey in Syria.

While it never reached the prototype stage, wind tunnel tests showed the structure capable of exceeding Mach 2.6. It was designed to fly at over 1000MPH with a range of 1000 miles. Designed around the end of 1944, this plane could never have been made in time or in numbers to make a difference but it was a remarkable design.The JU-287 was a swept wing jet used as a test bed for engine and wing development but was far advanced for its time. Actual swept wing fighters using this design technology wouldn‚Äôt come into actual fruition until the 1970s.Sperber Infrared TargetingIn Mid-1944 the Germans had sufficiently developed infrared equipment to the point that the plan was to outfit every Panther ‚ÄúF‚Äù with infrared equipment. At the time, night-fighting with tanks was a revolutionary concept. While the project worked well in training and the training was extensive, with five Panther battalions trained to use the equipment, it was never outfit on the units in time for combat. In February, 1945, some tanks were outfit and sent into the field for training and reported excellent results, but the number of production units needed were of such inferior manufacturing quality by that time of the war that they were all pulled out of production and except for a few more feeble tests the project stopped. The war was nearly over at that point.Horten HO-229 Jet BomberOne of the most remarkable planes of the war was the futuristic flying wing jet bomber HO-229. This revolutionary plane was designed to bomb England from a high altitude of as much as 50,000 feet and travel at near-supersonic speed, all while evading radar. So remarkable was this design the Northrupp-Grumman recently spent 250,000 dollars to build a full-scale mock-up to perform radar testing. It turns out the plane was not very stealthy, but the other performance characteristics were leading-edge designs that guided Allied jet development in the years to come. Only one partial prototype exists - it was dismantled and sent the US for testing and the wings were somehow lost.The FX-1400 ‚ÄúFritz X‚Äù Guided MissileThis was one of the most promising technologies the Germans developed and it terrified the Allies. It was one thing to suffer from bombs dropped from planes or even dumb rockets but the Fritz X was a missile that could be guided to the target by an operator in a plane. The Fritz X enjoyed considerable success, sinking or damaging many Allied warpships including one transport, causing the death of hundreds of soldiers, but it had many weaknesses, including the need for the targeting aircraft to fly straight and true through flak and fighters while it directed the bomb to the target. Eventually, the Germans put television cameras in the bomb and used screens in the aircraft to guide the bomb to the target. This was tried against the Russians with marginal success as television technology of the day was very weak and the Germans were short of the necessary materials to make it work well. Nevertheless, it was a wonder to the world when the Americans used television guided bombs in the first Gulf War - but the Germans were there first, fifty years earlier. To be fair, the Americans also built a similar device called the Azon which experienced considerable success in the Far East against the Japanese.The X-4 Wire-Guided MissileWhile TOW and other wire-guided missile systems are common now, the Germans developed them throughout the war. They were never able to get them into production and as time went on, the highly complex fuel for the rocket engines was hard to get and just as likely to kill the operator as the target but this weapon was the design basis for entire weapons platforms around the world, many still in use today.The MK-213 Revolver CannonToday, mini-guns are all the rage but Mauser was nearly complete with a 20 and 30mm revolver cannon that could shoot 1400 rounds per minute called the MK-213 revolver cannon. Instead of having multiple barrels like a minigun, it had a revolving cylinder. It was planned to put the thing on certain aircraft but the weight of the ammunition was a factor. The device was first promulgated in WW1 but development was nearly complete by the end of the war. Many nations, including France and America, implemented the technology in aircraft-based weapons such as ADEN and M39 which are still in use today. This was indeed a war-changing weapon.HS-298 Radio Guided Air-to-Air MissileThis weapon never passed the ‚Äúworking prototype stage‚Äù and was launched only a number of times but had it been implemented it would have wreaked havoc on the slow-moving bombers of the time, for which there was no defense against the weapon. After the war, Allied scientists all over the world improved on the design and wing-launched air-to-air missiles are standard armament. They had their start here.The MK-115 Machine GunIn the 1980s the HK G11 was all the rage because it used a completely combustible cartridge. There was no expulsion of metal casings or need for brass. It never caught on as the Cold War ended but this technology started with the MK-115 Machine Gun that used a combustible cartridge case the minimized the need for hard-to-get brass and still delivered a 55mm cartridge at enemy aircraft at a high rate of speed. Keep in mind that guns designed to knock out tanks were only 50mm at the beginning of the war. This weapon, which fired 300 rounds per minute, would have devastated aircraft and ground targets alike. A single prototype was captured by the Americans at the end of the war.The BK-7.5 Auto-CannonToday, the A-10 Warthog firing lots of heavy caliber rounds is an accepted technology but in WW2 developing a 75mm tank busting gun was a huge advance for the Germans - not because of the gun, which was quite common, but because it was fitted with a 12 round magazine. Consider that the same gun on the ground required a crew of at least three, preferably five men to serve it and it only fired one round. The BK-7.5 had only the pilot to pull the trigger and it reloaded itself 12 times. This was an astounding achievement for the time. The problem was that the recoil was so severe that the gun shook the plane to pieces. The aircraft using this weapon, if it returned at all, had to go in for major rework. The gun was also very heavy and altered the flying characteristics of the airframe but it did deliver some decent results on the Eastern Front. The Germans were never able to perfect the design.The Rheinbotte Rocket ArtilleryThe Germans were running out of resources and unable to keep up with the demand for artillery. For every two cannons lost, they could only produce one. A new method was needed and this was ‚Äúrocket artillery‚Äù. The Germans developed an entire class of rocket artillery to replace the standard long-range artillery piece. These weapons used minimal materials and were lightweight and easy to transport, but they were saturation weapons, not accurate to any degree. The Rhienbotte was tried on Antwerp, the unfortunate Belgian city that was the target of every army during the war. It was not effective but more research might have improved it. No one has really taken up the cudgel of rocket based artillery.The Type XVII SubmarineOne of the problems with U-boats was that they were too slow underwater. As a result, the enemy could always plot the radius of action and send resources out to coral them. A higher speed boat would make the radius unpractical for the defense and so the Germans developed a U-boat that could go about 32 mph under the water. This was revolutionary for the period. Two working prototypes, one of which carried Admiral Doenitz on trials, and six boats were ordered but they could not be completed by the end of the war and other technologies had bypassed them within a few years of the war‚Äôs end.The Rocket U-boatThe Germans tried to mount the Nebelwerfer on their U-boats as a way to attack convoy escorts. In fact, the Nebelwerfers worked well up to 39 feet underwater but there was no way to aim them or reload them so the project was scrapped. The next attempt was to mount the V-1 on the U-boat as a way to attack America from 150 miles offshore. This project showed real promise but interference from Goering, who did not want to part with any Luftwaffe technology, sunk the program before it could be completed. Eventually, the Germans decided to attack NYC with V-2 rockets. This required a special, unmanned U-boat that contained a single rocket with a launching platform. The unmanned U-boat would be towed by another U-boat to the launch position and set up to fire. Although this never came to fruition, it frightened the US into developing anti-measures. However, after the war, the Russians developed an entire class of submarines based on this concept, containing only two ballistic missiles in pods on the side of the submarine. The sub would get into position, surface, raise the launch pads and fire the missiles. It was a suicide mission as the firing of the missiles would damage the sub so much it could no longer operate. One of these subs was based in Providence, RI after the Cold War as a museum until it sank.",485 followers,Harmen Breedeveld,6.1K,99,1.9M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Why-can-t-DRDO-make-a-dependable-main-battle-tank-considering-it-has-enough-advanced-technologies-to-make-advanced-fighter-aircraft

The Soviets were capable of producing extremely fine engineering, however, this takes time and in order to increase mass production of equipment, the Soviets would often innovative in ways which made manufacture of the weapon easier, without reducing combat ability.The Soviets shifted technological focus to be on what they perceived won battles. For example, the T-34‚Äì85 was an upgrade over the T-34 basic version, which included upgrades to communication, more crew, mobility and particularly firepower against soft targets. The armour was upgraded on the turret but otherwise left the same, and while it‚Äôs gun power was increased against armour this was not a priority. The Panther tank on the other hand, was a new tank which was meant to defeat other tanks, it had a huge upgrade in armour penetration over the Panzer IV, but it essentially had no advantage in firepower against soft targets, additionally it was 4‚Äì5 times more expensive than a T-34‚Äì85.The result was that the T-34‚Äì85s could be deployed with 3 tanks facing every 1 panther, while still having two tanks left to attack where no panthers were. This mindset is very prominent across all Soviet military technology. If a tank spends most of the time fighting infantry, make it good at that, make it cheap enough to be available, and reliable enough to get there. Since the Soviets managed to introduce their mid war technologies, they never lost the strategic initiative, because they were constantly able to produce enough effective weapons to supply all fronts, all the time. The Germans while often considered to have ‚Äúbetter‚Äù in quality tanks, never produced a tank which was so much better in quality, that it actually mattered.This topic is long and complicated, and it‚Äôs also a trend that continued into the cold war.

In many ways, THAT‚ÄôS the ‚ÄúMost Dangerous Weapon.‚Äù And when some German units surrendered, action reports found that *other* German units would also surrender in a domino effect. And they surrendered by the many 10‚Äôs of thousands.Lindybeige (great Youtuber!) studied 31 actions in France in late summer/early fall 1944 from one small group of Crocodiles and reports found they burned to death 154 German soldiers, but 5425 Germans‚Ä¶surrendered. They did a tactic called ‚Äúadvertising,‚Äù spraying flame at long range, showing the Germans the capabilities of their Crocs, giving them the options: the ‚ÄúCarrot,‚Äù surrender to the escorting British infantry, and the ‚ÄúStick,‚Äù being burned to death‚Ä¶not much of a choice. The ratio amazingly was 27 Germans would surrender to the escorting infantry for every German injured in the fight. (‚ÄúIt pays to advertise.‚Äù)above:The flame projector was a powerful psychological weapon, so feared by the Germans that captured Crocodile crews were often summarily executed.Its frontal armor was 152 mm (For caparison, a German Tiger I had 100 mm of front armor.)Specialty: flamethrower tank.

Their engines were never powerful enough to carry a tank that weighs as much as a modern MBT, but has a 10th the amount of engine power. They constantly broke down and suffered as many losses to getting stuck and mechanical failures, as they did from enemy fire. They were so complex that no significant amount could ever be fielded, they were a drain on German resources, and they never even once resulted in an operational victory for the Germans, all being destroyed by lighter and simpler tanks such as the IS-2 and Sherman 76 at Balaton and Bulge.They were however at least operational, and they did cause allied casualties, even if never enough to win anything.Top 4 - Bismark and TirpitzThe very idea that 2 German battleships, could ever hope to challenge the British navy was silly to begin with. The Germans never used these ships in concentrated groups, and for most of the war Tirpitz sat around in Norway, waiting to attack British convoys to the USSR. It mostly failed at doing this, and eventually was destroyed by British bombers without contributing much. A battleship is quite possibly the most impratical convoy raider you can imagine, and totally silly for a nation relying on submarines to try to use it as such. They even equipped the Tirpitz with torpedos, for what ever crazy reason. Perhaps they just thought it was a big cruiser. Either way, huge amount of resources and not a lot to show for it. But it did sorta kinda scare the UK and they did have to spend some resources sinking it.Top 3 - Super heavy siege artilleryImagine how much fuel the above vehicle required to move across country. The Germans wasted significant amount of resources making artillery such as this Karl-Gerat 600mm mortar, and the 800mm railway artillery gun Schwere Gustav. They were so impractical and unwieldy they were rarely used far from Germany‚Äôs borders, and only in prolonged city battles. What a waste of resources. Big gun goes big boom doesn‚Äôt win wars.Top 2 - V-2 Rocket ProgramThe V-2 rocket program was absurd in many ways. The very purpose was to make a more efficient way of terror bombing countries such as England, however the V-1 already did this pretty cost effectively. The V-2 on the other hand actually costed more to make than the nuclear Manhatten project. It required slave labour from concentration camps to make, and more people dying building these rockets, than died from them exploding. Not only that, but the highly advanced rocket fuel needed for these rockets, consumed 30% of synthetic ethnonel-fuel near the end of the war for all of Germany. Fuel which was desperately needed in Germany‚Äôs industry and military. The V-2 failed to cause significant damage to England, but it succeeded in draining Germanys resources. It was totally impractical against military targets. It was only ever successful in proving the concept that ballistic missiles works in theory.Top 1 - Me-163This German rocket interceptor was a dumpster fire. In a silly attempt at making an interceptor that could take off fast and fight in the air, the Germans created this. It had a whopping 7.5 minutes of flight time, which is a bit of a joke. It did not turn well. It couldn‚Äôt fly long. IT was complicated and expensive. And they still made over 300 of them that had practically no impact on anything.

InYes, Hitler had many super weapons under development, which did not make it to the war or was produced only as prototypes and saw little action.One such example, also my personal favourite, is the Horten 229. This aircraft has proclaimed the title ‚ÄúHitler‚Äôs stealth aircraft.‚Äù((Walter Horten was an ace fighter pilot in the German Luftwaffe, having scored seven kills flying as wingman of the legendary Adolf Galland during the Battle of Britain. His brother Reimar was an aeroplane designer lacking a formal aeronautical education. In their youth, the pair had designed a series of innovative tail-less manned gliders.In 1943, Luftwaffe chief Herman Goering laid out the so-called 3x1000 specification for a plane that could fly one thousand kilometres an hour carrying one thousand kilograms of bombs with fuel enough to travel one thousand kilometres and back‚Äîwhile still retaining a third of the fuel supply for use in combat. Such an aeroplane could strike targets in Britain while outrunning any fighters sent to intercept it.Clearly, the new turbojet engines Germany had developed would be required for an aeroplane to attain such high speeds. But jet engines burned through their fuel very quickly, making raids on more distant targets impossible. The Horten brothers‚Äô idea was to use a flying wing design‚Äîa tail-less plane so aerodynamically clean it generated almost no drag at all. Such an airframe would require less engine power to attain higher speeds, and therefore consume less fuel.Flying wing designs were not an entirely new idea and had been used before in both gliders and powered aircraft. During World War II, Northrop developed its own high-performing XB-35 flying wing bomber for the U.S. military, though it failed to enter mass production. Despite the aerodynamic advantages, the lack of a tail tended to make fly wing aircraft prone to uncontrolled yaws and stalls.The Horten brothers were given the go-ahead to pursue the concept in August 1943. They first built an unpowered glider known as the H.IX V1. The V1 had long, thin swept wings made of plywood in order to save weight. These ‚Äúbell-shaped‚Äù wings compensated for the yawning problem. Lacking a rudder or ailerons, the H.IX relied upon ‚Äúelevons‚Äù (combinations of ailerons and elevators) and two sets of spoilers for control. The elevons could be moved differentially to induce roll, or together in the same direction to change pitch, while the spoilers were used to induce yaw.Following successful tests of the V1 glider at Oranienberg on March 1944, the subsequent V2 prototype was mounted with two Jumo 004B turbojet engines nestled to either side of a cockpit pod made of welded steel tubing. It also featured a primitive ejection seat and a drogue chute deployed while landing, while redesigned tricycle landing gear was installed to enable the plane to carry heavier loads.The first test flight occurred on February 2, 1945. The manta-shaped jet exhibited smooth handling and good stall resistance. The prototype even reportedly beat a Me 262 jet fighter, equipped with the same Jumo 004 engines, in a mock dogfight.But the testing process was cut short on February 18 when one of the V2‚Äôs jet engines caught fire and stopped mid-flight. Test pilot Erwin Ziller performed a number of turns and dives in an effort to restart the engine, before apparently passing out from the fumes and spiralling his plane into the ground, mortally wounding him.Regardless, Goering had already approved the production of forty flying wings, to be undertaken by the Gotha company, which mostly produced trainers and military gliders during World War II. The production planes were designated Ho 229s or Go 229s.Because of the Ho 229‚Äôs great speed‚Äîit was believed the production version would be able to attain 975 kilometers per hour‚Äîit was repurposed to serve as a fighter with a planned armament of two heavy Mark 103 thirty-millimetre cannons. Construction of four new prototypes‚Äînumbered V3 through V6‚Äî was initiated, two of which would have been two-seat night fighters.However, the Ho 229 never made it off the ground. When American troops of VIII Corps rolled into the factory at Friedrichroda, Germany in April 1945, they found just the cockpit sections of the prototypes in various stages of development. A single pair of corresponding wings was found 75 miles away. The most complete of the four, the V3 prototype, was shipped back to the United States for study along with the wings, and can today be seen under restoration at the Udvar-Hazy Center of the United States Air and Space Museum in Chantilly, Virginia.(Reference List:Horten Ho 229 - WikipediaHitler's 'Stealth' Fighter: The Story of the Ho 229Horten Ho IX / Ho 229 Jet-Powered Flying Wing / Fighter-Bomber - Nazi GermanyHorten Ho 229 V3",0 followers,Brent Cooper,6.2K,7.9K,409.4M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-of-the-most-mindblowing-superweapons-or-advanced-technologies-that-Nazi-Germany-is-supposed-to-have-developed-during-WW2-Which-ones-are-most-likely-to-have-actually-existed

As the U.S. played a major role in the Battle of the Atlantic, turning that strength against the British would have been disastrous. The United States would have likely invaded Canada, denying the British government a refuge there if the Isles were occupied by Germany.With the Atlantic Wall no longer needed, Germany could have sent the divisions in the West to the Eastern front to bolster the Eastern Front, as well as the 200,000 soldiers in Norway. There would be no Italian front, as the American soldiers landing in Africa in 1943 would have bolstered Rommel‚Äôs Afrika Corps. Manpower would tell, and the combined army would have driven all the way into the Middle East and beyond, making the Mediterranean an Axis lake.In the Pacific, the Axis dominates. Japan can turn most of its military production to China, as there is no American enemy, and no bombing campaign. With the combined Japanese-American Navy in the Pacific, New Guinea, Australia, and New Zealand fall to a naval blockade and land invasion. The Japanese quickly learn that their tanks are inadequate, and design new vehicles based off the M4 Sherman. All of the Pacific islands in Japanese hands are left untouched, and the remaining important groups are invaded by the Japanese, Americans, or both.American supplies flown to China over the Himalayas are instead used to support the Japanese army in Burma, which eventually overwhelms the British resistance and invades India. China gets no support from the U.S., and eventually falls when American soldiers used in the island hopping campaign are instead earmarked for China to assist the Kwangtung Army. Mongolia is invaded, and the two armies eventually invade the eastern Soviet Union, assisted by B-29s and other bombers from bases in China.The Wehrmacht steadily loses ground on the Eastern Front, but American soldiers, tanks, guns, and, most importantly, aircraft, are beginning to arrive in Europe in force. Priority is at first to get American bombers to the front. Without the bombing campaigns against Germany, thousands of anti-aircraft guns are used as anti-tank guns on the Eastern Front, and the full might of the Luftwaffe is available in the east. Once American bombers are at the front, the tide begins to turn. B-17s and 24s bomb Russian cities and factories around the clock. The Red Army still advances, but slowly, and at a horrendous cost. American P-47s help Stukas and Hs 129s rain hell on anything Russian that moves. Simultaneously, Mustangs and Lightnings fly sorties with 109s and Fw-190s to ground the Red Air Force.The American forces arrive at the front, historically 91 divisions and 4.5 million men strong, but that, and more, will arrive in a steady wave. The combined army begins rolling back the Red Army. Eventually, Minsk, Kiev, Kursk, Smolensk, Leningrad, Kharkov, and Rostov fall.In the shadows, a top secret German-American research project finally reaches fruition. Hitler demands this weapon be deployed against Stalingrad, but, taking the advice of his top generals, reluctantly agrees to first coordinate with the Americans and present surrender terms. Stalin rebuffs them.Red Army soldiers have been assembled to defend Stalingrad, but are baffled and amused when a single B-29 appears above them. Their amusement does not last long, and the ruins of the city are quickly bypassed. Again, surrender terms are presented, and again, they are rebuffed. Two days later, a second B-29 appears over Moscow. Joseph Stalin and his Stavka perish in the blast, but the Red Army fights on. Moscow is also bypassed, and the city of Yekaterinburg is eventually taken, and with it, the last means of Soviet production in the Ural Mountains. With the Red Army in shambles, the Soviet Union surrenders, dividing the country between the Germans and Japanese at the city of Novosibirsk.
