Department de Monterrey, Mexico, population 1.25 million.From the outside, looking in, Mexico seems like a pretty nice place, especially from central and South America.But then you look closer.Massive hillside slum, also in Monterrey. City officials paint the projects bright colors to hide their filth from the wealthy people in the valley below.About 10% of Mexicans have all the resources and live like Americans do. The rest live in stack-houses like this on the fringes of the cities. Clean running water is hard to come by, the streets are dirt or in a terrible state of repair. Children are less likely to attend school than to have a job paying low wages.Drugs, cartels, and gangs rule the world in this place. Murder is so common the police won’t come there unless there’s a battle. This is the Mexico the resorts would like you to forget.It’s also why people cross the border illegally. It’s better and safer to languish in a United States jail than to live in the slums. People Americans deport often cross illegally again.It’s a dark society in that nation. I know many people who have worked 14 hours a day for a year, only to make $3000 in that whole time.In America you’re considered poor if you don’t make at least that much in a month.It’s frightning to think what sits just across the border.

That hardly translates into an AI that can think like a human and solve problems. There are no AIs currently that can reason about why your girlfriend suddenly got sullen and quiet with you, or why Billy down the street beat up a cat.Then there’s Ray Kurzweil. I’d like to get him on stage and beat him over the head with a mop for the terrible hype he generates regarding the ‘Singularity’. His time frame is wrong, his view is only an opinion, not fact nor provable fact. He angers me for conning the public into thinking humans are going to be threatened by AI overlords any time soon. Not going to happen. Making AIs as smart as people is exceedingly hard and it’s not soon in the cards. I say this as an AI researcher who works on these problems and I see how truly difficult they are. We can, and will solve some of the problems but we are a long way from AIs that can match human minds. An AI that plays Go better than humans is buildable because the game is a closed small universe. What humans have to work with is an enormous complicated world, and much harder to deal with.So, yes, AI is way hyped, and the promoters may be leading us to the next AI winter if they keep up the crap and eventually burn out expectations.","8,707 followers",Mario Galindo Queralt,529,637,8.8M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-need-of-having-a-degree-in-b-tech-for-the-students-of-tier-3-colleges-when-the-current-world-is-in-emerging-technologies-that-was-not-taught-in-our-entire-curriculum

I think AI will kill jobs, and over time, AI might kill most “jobs” as we know them. I think that people are somewhat complacent in regard to the economic impact of AI, and will likely be ill-prepared for the changes we have to adapt to in the not-so-distant future.First, let's start with the comparisons to machinery and automation. They did indeed put factory workers out of work. In that respect, I agree AI today is similar in many applications, replacing workers who have less specialized skills, perhaps call center operators, office assistants (in a limited extent), and maybe soon, taxi drivers and truck drivers. But I would argue that AI is fundamentally different from machinery or most of the other analogies commonly made when answering this question, because AI is growing and is unlikely to stop growing. It's growing in breadth (of applications and industries), in geographic and economic scope, and in power (it's capacity to address increasingly complex tasks). A more fitting analogy would be machinery in an automobile plant that not only made the parts one day, but then learned how to assemble them the week after, and then how to design cars a year later.I think that there is little that is out of reach for advanced AI of the future. Let's leave the question of the AI singularity alone for now. Instead, I think that deep learning efforts at Google and elsewhere are making AI systems learn faster and faster, with a growing rate of acceleration. Advanced AI can now address increasingly complex tasks including medical diagnosis, stock market trading, weather prediction and human behavioral modeling. Very soon, it will be able to take the place of certain types of teachers, and find a role in education. It can already deal with complex systems in software and mathematics, and seems to be only limited in applications that require interactions with the physical world (sensors are still imperfect), and with people.So without projecting too far into the future, we can ask the question, what jobs will NOT be killed by AI? Jobs that involve labor are already (or soon to be) replaced. Jobs that require logical reasoning are being replaced, albeit at a slower rate. What are the qualities that humans have that cannot be captured by AI? Perhaps creativity, emotional responses? So perhaps researchers in academia will survive longer than most, and artists (though AI stylistic mimicry is already quite impressive and their results enjoyable), and counselors/psychologists/case workers, and decision makers like CEOs who cannot be predictable or error prone. And hopefully software engineers and algorithm designers who develop AI systems.This leaves a very, very small portion of today's jobs intact. Many say: we just need to train people to fill higher level jobs created by AI, e.g. Programmers, ML researchers. But this is no easy feat. The US educational system is struggling to meet the demands created by advanced technology today. This failure is in part responsible for the economic divide plaguing the country today. The challenge of educating the public for a job market that is both decreasing in scope and increasing in complexity, is nothing we've ever faced before.I am far from original in this opinion. But if I had to guess, I would say that AI will put far more people out of work than we can (re)train in time. That will have significant economic repercussions as corporations seeking to minimize cost will do so at the cost of rising unemployment. There will need to be dramatic changes in social policies in order to avert large scale economic disaster, first dramatic rises in minimum wage, then eventually some type of universal income/welfare. It's the kind of change that requires significant leadership in our government, something that seems woefully absent today.","3,905 followers",Monica Anderson,806,148,1M,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-need-of-having-a-degree-in-b-tech-for-the-students-of-tier-3-colleges-when-the-current-world-is-in-emerging-technologies-that-was-not-taught-in-our-entire-curriculum
