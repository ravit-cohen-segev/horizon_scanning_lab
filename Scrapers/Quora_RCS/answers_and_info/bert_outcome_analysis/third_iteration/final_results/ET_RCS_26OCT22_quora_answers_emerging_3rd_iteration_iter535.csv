Was really skeptical about the tuition fee but had to make a choice and I did.Well everyone has written about facilities and campus etc which is true and accurate but something I want to add that -There are two types of colleges.Type 2 - A college where after four years you leave with a dream.MIT is Type 2 ( at least for me )You can always make the money back. Sometimes even in a month. But don't give in the opportunity to have the most amazing,scary,fun-filled,competitive,learning and messed up four years of your life.Rest is your choice.",329 followers,Mukul Dhariwal,1.2K,0,0,2015,https://www.quora.com/Are-top-recruiters-outside-India-aware-of-Manipal-Institute-of-Technology-and-its-students

Joining MIT does not come with a guarantee of becoming the CEO of a top multinational later on in your career. Not even the IITs do. It is a good thing that two of our alumi have made it that high up the ladder though and it does in some way speak as how the assumption in people as to ""MIT being the IIPM"" of engineering is very very wrong.I would definitely tell you this: Manipal is one of the best private engineering institutes in India. Without a shred of doubt. There are many things people say about it being the place where all the spoilt rich kids go and where you find drugs in abundance. Well,1. There is a LOT of diversity in students who come to Manipal. Both socio-economic and demographic diversity. Not all students are rich. Not all students are spoilt. And even IITs have rich and spoilt people. That is not a correct parameter to judge an institute.2. Every college has drugs and people who are addicted to them. But here, it is a very small minority and nobody forces anyone to do anything against their wish. You control your own life.3. We have good faculty. Obviously not IIT standard, but they are good. Very good. Some are even brilliant. And the same can be said about the students. The best students here could easily rival the best students from any institute in the country.4. Infrastructure. Is world class. I can not describe it well enough in words. You have to come here and see it to believe it.5. Same goes for the environment and ambience. Its near the beaches, it rains 4 months an year. Its almost heavenly at times.I would say that NIT Allahabad is a tough place to get into, so congratulate yourself on your achievement. However, please do not go by what your ""friend circle"" says about places it has never been to or has no proper knowledge about.Nobody at MIT wants the world to believe we are as good as the IITs, because we are not there yet. But what we do want is for people to actually start dropping the inaccurate stereotypes about this place.If you ever come to visit Manipal out of curiosity in the next 3 years, contact me and I will give a personal tour of all that is right and wrong with the place. And believe me, none of the things that are wrong with Manipal is known by anyone outside of Manipal.","21,936 followers",Vidhi Khandel,20K,182,11.1M,2014,https://www.quora.com/Are-top-recruiters-outside-India-aware-of-Manipal-Institute-of-Technology-and-its-students

You can only strike with the fingers and the upper half of the palm. You’re not allowed to hit temples, ears and eyes.Although Vasily said he only slapped his opponents “half-heartedly”, he still knocked two of them out.Vasily admitted that the competition was easy for him, and that he controlled himself so he wouldn’t hurt anyone.“I'm a very peaceful person and I never hit people. I used to do some power lifting, but I stopped going to a gym because I don't have time.”Vasily, who weighs 186 kg (410 pounds), won the competition and received 15,000 rubles. “The prize money paid off my trip.”Vasily received the nickname “Dumpling”. The Youtube video with Vasily knocking out his opponents has 19 million views.Although he became famous and received invitations to participate in many TV shows, Vasily continues to work on his farm.On December 9th, Vasili came to Moscow to take part in another face-slapping contest.In his first fight, he faced a massive bald guy of roughly similarly weight. Vasili gave him a hard slap, but the guy barely moved.He then slapped Vasili so hard, the Dumpling collapsed on the floor unconscious, and was taken to a hospital.","43,379 followers",Misha Firer,6K,1.3K,133.6M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Are-top-recruiters-outside-India-aware-of-Manipal-Institute-of-Technology-and-its-students

Huge Russian flesh bears and skinny pubescent Goth kids face each other on a regular basis, and no one; not the referees or the audiences, bats an eye.The game itself is very simple. Two opponents face each other with only a standing table separating them. They’re given a few minutes to warm up and stretch a bit, and during this period, they also put earplugs in their ears (to avoid blowing their eardrums, I assume) and dip their hands in white powder for extra grip.The referee blows the signal and the participants start violently slapping each other. But not in an uncivilized way! They take turns to slap each other like real gentlemen and sometimes they even help each other up after knocking someone unconscious to the floor.This is where things get a bit mysterious. ThereAnd that’s it. That’s all they do. Slap each other with meaty palms while hundreds of skinny boys and hired attractive ladies stare at them in quiet disbelief.I hate boxing with a passion, but this sport is just too stupid to hate.It’s great fun. 😁","66,668 followers",Dima Vorobiev,2.3K,4.2K,138.9M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Are-top-recruiters-outside-India-aware-of-Manipal-Institute-of-Technology-and-its-students

The entire time I had a horrified look on my face, and kept saying ‘What is going on??’. No one answered me. *Interesting side note: when they plopped me down in front of an investigator who spoke English (while I was handcuffed to the chair), she asked if I had any questions for her. My brain was in such a state of shock all I could think to ask was “Do you think I'll miss the wedding?” She answered “Yes, I think you will”. Then I started crying.I was unable to contact any family or friends after being arrested. This is applied to everyone, no matter what the charge.Then began the worst travel experience of my life. And it lasted for 35 days. I will make a long story short in saying that it took 35 days, 2 high powered lawyers from Tokyo and becoming semi-fluent in Japanese to be released without charge. The same cannot be said for my traveling companion, who ended up in jail for much, much longer.The biggest takeaway here (this should be a no-brainer, but just in case!):Although I had nothing to do with this case of smuggling, it still took a very long time for me to prove I was innocent. And believe you me, they left absolutely no stone unturned in their investigation. Japan has a 99.5% conviction rate. The fact that I was released without charge further proved my innocence.I lost 25 lbs, and when I returned home I lost most of my hair from the sudden weight loss and stress.I have not let this hinder my love of travel though! Not even a year after the incident, I went back to Japan (without the companion) to explore what I did not get to experience the first time. I will keep traveling till the day I die, and I will tell this story to my grandchildren, along with all the other amazing stories I have collected along the way :)Here is a picture of me enjoying tea ceremony at Hikone castle near Osaka (with no thoughts of the jail cell I spent so much time in)Edit: this is my most prized document, received from my lawyers after I returned home - my Notice of non-prosecution!
