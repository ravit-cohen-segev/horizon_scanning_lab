Here’s a quote from NASA:TheIsn't it a good idea to send another Voyager space craft now with more advanced technology available today?It would be an excellent missionHistoryThe original Grand Tour was scrapped in the early 70s. Here’s a quote from NASA:TheThen the Voyager mission attempted to take a less grand tour:The Voyager mission was designed to take advantage of a rare geometric arrangement of the outer planets in the late 1970s and the 1980s which allowed for a four-planet tour for a minimum of propellant and trip time. This layout of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune, which occurs about every 175 years, allows a spacecraft on a particular flight path to swing from one planet to the next without the need for large onboard propulsion systems.That too was scrapped:While the four-planet mission was known to be possible, it was deemed to be too expensive to build a spacecraft that could go the distance, carry the instruments needed and last long enough to accomplish such a long mission. Thus, the Voyagers were funded to conduct intensive flyby studies of Jupiter and Saturn only.The Jupiter and Saturn flybys were an immense success but NASA decided to extend the Voyager missions:The mission objective of the Voyager Interstellar Mission (VIM) is to extend the NASA exploration of the solar system beyond the neighborhood of the outer planets to the outer limits of the Sun's sphere of influence, and possibly beyond.That too was a success. Unfortunately the Voyager’s ability to communicate with Earth will cease in the next year or two. They won’t stop flying, they just won’t be able to tell us the glorious sights they see.In about 40,000 years, Voyager 1 will drift within 1.6 light-years of AC+79 3888, a star in the constellation of Camelopardalis which is heading toward the constellation Ophiuchus. In about 40,000 years, Voyager 2 will pass 1.7 light-years from the star Ross 248 and in about 296,000 years, it will pass 4.3 light-years from Sirius, the brightest star in the sky. The Voyagers are destined—perhaps eternally—to wander the Milky Way.I would love to see similar missions, and, as you say, with advanced technology they could be designed to, say, study Uranus and Neptune and then cruise around in the Oort Cloud for many more years than the current Voyagers. They could have similar missions as New Horizons which opened our eyes to Pluto and Charon.

There was also the need to refill with water as well as fuel. Electric cars were quiet and simple to drive, but the range was poor. This was also before electricity supplies were particularly widespread or standardised, so recharging may have been problematic.The invention of the electric starter motor and standardised controls basically killed off steam and electric and internal-combustion emerged as the dominant technology for the 20th century. Incremental advances such as automatic transmissions and synchronised manual gearboxes made driving them simpler and further cemented their place at the top. Electricity continued in a few niche applications (such as British milk floats used for early morning deliveries) but for cars, BEVs were basically nonexistent. Terrible examples such as the Sinclair C5 and Reva G-Wiz caused more harm than good to the electric vehicle market.Today, advances in battery technology and electrical infrastructure makes electric vehicles a more practical proposition. Contrary to the political weight currently being placed behind them though, they are not the answer to everyone's needs for every situation.

24,"You mean likeThe Voyager probes made flybys of their intended targets; then continued to leave our solar system. So has New Horizons.Or maybe theThis thing was more capable in its ability to slow down, orbit Ceres then move to Vesta using its ION thrusters! It visited two of the three known proto-planets of the asteroid belt.","220,557 followers",Franklin Veaux,1.6K,47.3K,782.4M,2020,https://www.quora.com/The-Star-Wars-Universe-spans-tens-of-thousands-of-years-Why-have-these-beings-had-such-advanced-technology-for-so-long-and-how-come-they-advance-so-slowly
25,"As has been said, New Horizons is much the same. But, of course, being launched later, it has not got so far.But the Voyagers were launched to take advantage of a particular configuration of planets which allowed what the called the Grand Tour of several major planets with a single probe. And that was what they were designed to do - to visit Jupiter, Saturn and and Neptune with a single spacecraft and much less time than would normally be needed. The deep space exploration is just a bonus, not part of the original design. But if you can get it, why not?","2,481 followers",Lucas Curtis,8K,5.3K,10.5M,2020,https://www.quora.com/The-Star-Wars-Universe-spans-tens-of-thousands-of-years-Why-have-these-beings-had-such-advanced-technology-for-so-long-and-how-come-they-advance-so-slowly

27,"It has a power source that uses the heat generated by decaying, radioactive plutonium. It decays very slowly. It has been generating electricity from the heat the whole time. However, it is cooling down and now only produces a fraction of the electricity that it originally did. NASA has shut down all the unnecessary instruments and uses the electricity to run the radio transmitter.",5 followers,Jake Williams,9.9K,3.2K,76.6M,2020,https://www.quora.com/The-Star-Wars-Universe-spans-tens-of-thousands-of-years-Why-have-these-beings-had-such-advanced-technology-for-so-long-and-how-come-they-advance-so-slowly
