It seems like technology is progressing really fast today, but that is because of all the technology that literally took ages to figure out.How long would it take to figure out how to do any of the simple technologies above, simply by trial and error? It could take a really long time, for example, to figure out what Iron Ore looks like, and how to build a forge hot enough to melt it. Especially if you didn’t even have any idea that Iron even exists.I mean, come on. Everyone knows rocks don’t melt. If they did, how could we use them to build ovens. Right????So there are a lot of hurdles. But once a technology has been figured out, we can build on it to create the next step.These days, we’ve figured out enough things to do a lot. We’ve also figured out something called science, which is the art of figuring out new things.Tasks that were once really hard, become much easier.

From birth, it has been listening to and learning about the sounds that form its native language. They did this using some interesting statistical properties of language, all on their own without even trying.At 12-months this has advanced to a level where they will apply this knowledge and start to form words. These words have meaning: when they say mama they really do mean mama. These words are also contextually applicable and directed, they are talking toThey will understand even more than they produce, which is something people often forget. Even if a child only says Mama and Dada, their understanding is a lot bigger. They will even respond to those things, explore their social skills, test limits. Try saying “no” and see what happens if they disagree.They will learn quickly what is appropriate and what isn’t, but they are naive and that can be pretty funny sometimes.The picture also demonstrates another thing. Infants have logic, well a form of logic anyway. They reason to the best of their abilities. It’s nothing like the kind of reasoning we have as adults, but they have their own logic and view of the world (however small it is for them). Adults don’t always get that logic, resulting in a lot of confusion about what the little guy is trying to say.They will also start walking, which doesn’t sound impressive but any engineer will tell you it’s a lot harder than it seems.Walking requires a lot of things to work together. Movements need to be planned, limbs need to be coordinated, and balance needs to be kept by making tiny adjustments all the time.Fine motor control also improves, as they learn to coordinate their fingers to grab and manipulate small objects.Robots and AI is good, but not that good yet. The sheer amount going on in an infants brain all at once cannot be compared to anything we have at this moment.We might be able to design systems to mimic or copy a few of those skills, like walking or speech recognition/production, but those don’t come close to the real thing.For now, infants win.

It’s in what you are receptive to. It’s in the moment being just right. It’s in what you need to see or hear.Learning is not in the lesson.
