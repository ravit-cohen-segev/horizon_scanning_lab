We just don’t seem to talk about it much in the United States anymore.Let’s be honest. When our 8th Air Force began to arrive in Britain to take part in the air offensive against the Luftwaffe and our leadership wanted to use two aircraft completely inappropriate for high altitude combat, the P39 and P40, the Brits “greatly assisted” by providing Spitfires and Hurricanes.

I can go on and on with this….the RN and RCN providing most of the combat vessels and landing craft at Normandy….the plans for jet engines that were later used in our P80. I can go on and on with the list of “greatly assisting”, but there’s only so much one can write. With over 80% of the naval vessels at Normandy being British or Commonwealth, not even counting the air offensive in that landing, shouldn’t we as Americans state that Britain “saved” the US at Normandy? Fair is fair isn’t it?When I read about WWII, the real WWII, not some nationalistic tripe or cinema, I actually take more pride in that the US and our Allies, worked so well together and covered each others back. I take more pride in that, than some nonsense about us saving the world all alone.

While the lore behind why it happened is scant, the basic gist behind it is that the Men of Iron,The second period, which follows the Mechanoclasm, is Old Night itself. Because the Stone Men went extinct, any sort of DaOT technology that remained functional post Mechanoclasm started to break down. In return, predations by the Xenos, predations by desperate human factions, and predations by Chaos ruined any further chance of society further repairing itself. During this process, the galactic civilization splintered into individual, system spanning polities, during which more technology was lost as remaining Men of Iron remnants further terrorized mankind, and even those system spanning polities splintered into world-wide governments, before even those splintered into the technobarbarian nation—states we know of during the Unification wars. The only large exception to all this degredation are those that managed to retain a large part of their technologies: I.e The Auretian Technocracy, the Faash, the Interex, the Mechanicum, etc. Everything else was crumbling down.The third period, which is the Horus Heresy, saw the largest, technocracy at the time, the Mechanicum, fracture into the Dark Mechanicus and the Adeptus Mechanicum. The Dark Mechanicus sided with horus notnecessarily because of Chaos, but because Kelbor Hal and more progressive leaning factions of the Mechanicus despised the traditionalist, conservative views that were formed during Old Night, and they sided with Horus because he offered them the freedom they wanted to develop their technology.

You can still insert a bullet into the chamber that still fires. But the gun is, at least, 6 times less effective.That is somewhat where the Imperium of Man is. The Imperium has the infrastructure. It has the resources. It has the very weapons themselves. But it doesn’t understand them. Its massive guns are operated literally through prayer and “rites” rather than artificial intelligence and mechanization. The larger battleships of the Imperial Navy, which are literally capable of firing at an enemy ship, predicting that they will miss, and then saying “Fuck it, warp space and time and TELEPORT THE ENEMY SHIP BACK INTO OUR BARRAGE” either is slightly malfunctioned, or is perfectly functional. But no one on board knows how to use it.As well, the artificial intelligences and systems still exist on these ships. They can be accessed on occasion, by no small miracles. But let’s also remember that the Imperium was nearly destroyed by its efforts to create “Men of Iron.”Let’s ALSO note that the machine spirits inherent in all levels of Imperium technology is in fact the machinations of the Omnissiah, the machine god of the Adeptus Mechanicus, the main tech faction of the Imperium.This Omnissiah, with absolute certainty, is a piece of a C’tan, one of the old gods of the Necrontyr, split into thousands of pieces by spiteful subjects.The C’tan, and the Necrons, aren’t exactly fans of the Imperium. And they can influence their technology down to the guns that an infantryman carries.The Imperium of Man hasn’t lost all of its technology through war and destruction, although endless war certainly doesn’t HELP the infrastructure situation. The Imperium’s armed forces are literally sitting on a treasure trove, or perhaps a rotting carcass, of metal, machines, and technology that they simply have no hope of understanding, at least to its full extent.On the bright side, this is salvageable if only one person can come to light, such as a Primarch, who can remedy this situation, or if the Machine God can be negotiated with to live in cooperation with mankind. Not unprecedented, as the Necron and the C’tan become more relatable and less cuntish with each installment we learn of them.On the downside, the existential fear of the Imperium, and the inevitable destruction and recession of the Imperium as we view it today, is as a starving man dying in a field of wheat.",UNKNOWN,Michael B.,1.1K,6.4K,76.1M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Why-did-the-UK-share-all-their-advanced-technologies-with-the-US-during-WW2

Scientific, mathematic, physical and technological. It was developed so that any potential seed colony could produce tanks and laser guns pretty much within weeks of making planetfall using what resources they could find. You ask for a plan, it gives you holographic blueprints, instructions easy enough for anyone to understand and a list of materials adapted so anyone one could make them from anything. None of that faffing around with finding and attaching a team of experts to every mission or probing the planet for rare materials. It probably explains how tanks in 40K can run on petrol, hydrogen, cooking oil or even frickingIt’s quite likely that human colonies could have been made up of ordinary people, you me, your cousin Dilbert, who made planetfall and with this wonder-library created a prosperous town with no one more an expert than what you can find in your typical Midwestern small town.It was colonial expansion for dummies!Some lucky planets settled with plans for mecha that could cut down trees and scare away big predators. How to build and run one was mostly important to the people who used it.There was a degree of variation though. Most devices were carried by colonists. The need to build a 5km long battleship or a neutron star mining drill was probably not very high on most colonists’ agendas so a lot of STCs sent out would have had more practical plans like looms, shelters, power tools and maybe the odd nuclear reactor.As you can imagine, after a while populations became rather reliant on the knowledge stored inside these devices since all the experts were probably chilling in the core worlds. Then the Warp kind of got messed up, we don’t know the details entirely but everything went haywire, the robots killed a whole lot of people and most importantly there has yet to be found any STC containing anything more than a few files. The STCs are at risk of Warp corruption - they have AI like the Men of Iron and there are thousands on Mars that no one wants to touch because those that didn’t horribly glitch were defiled by Warp magic so whatThere's even been one STC fragment found that started spitting outThe largely-corrupted but not Warp-ruined devices are called STC ‘fragments’ since only a tiny part of their archives survive. Since the colonies had come to rely on the information inside these devices for pretty much anything, it meant that a lot of places had to almost start from scratch. Best explanation we have for how humanity in some places were reduced to stone age populations is that small colonies that arrived with an STC holding rudimentary knowledge. When these devices played up or failed during the Age of Strife, no one planetside would have known how to even build a wooden crane without instructions and everyone went back to stone tools and mud huts due to a lack of expertise.The Age of Strife was something like 7000 years. Some planets got around the failing of their STCs by recoding important things from their dying advisors. Others didn’t have such foresight. Earth on the other hand was something like a parody of a quote often attributed to Einstein:“I don’t know what World War 3 will be fought with, but I know World War 4 will be fought with sticks and stones”If The Collapse due to being cut off from the rest of humanity was World War 3.

( The Emperor had this in check during his reign but with him on life support, the Mechanicus became unfettered.)Essentially most of the high level technology no longer is known and the Imperium was forced to maintain and slowly recreate more limited versions of various technologies.",0 followers,Christopher Bowers,1.9K,1.2K,5.4M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Why-did-the-UK-share-all-their-advanced-technologies-with-the-US-during-WW2

I'm gonna go the other way and give maybe a simpler answer. TL;DR He probably couldn't because he didn't know how to, and even if he did, the Imperium in 30k probably lacked the industrial base or technical ability to produce it.I think he either legit did not know how most of it worked, or did not know how to obtain the resources or production chains required to build any of it.Firstly, the Emperor is indicated to be vastly better at basically anything he does than a normal human, but he is still more or less human — he has said himself he isn't a god, and its never indicated that he's omnipotent or omniscient or anything like that, and his overall portrayal is of a pretty imperfect super-human. There’s no reason to think his knowledge is perfect - he has been alive a really long time and probably has a good theoretical knowledge in regards to dark age technology, but unless he dedicated all of that time to learning the details of how to actually build that technology, there is no real reason to assume he would be able to.Look at it this way — let's say you have a great idea of how a computer works. You understand how the physical components interact with eachother, how to properly assemble them by connecting CPUs to motherboards and what have you. You know how to program it to do what you want. You probably can't, however, take a pile of metal and silicon and whatever and then form that into computer components — that knowledge is just outside of your area.Secondly, even if the Emperor knows how to build EVERYTHING, he doesnt nessicarily know where to get the base materials or make the required tools.An example for that — Let's say you have built guns all your life and know exactly how to produce an AK-47 from a block of metal. Somehow, you get sent back to the mid-1800s, and you figure you can make it big and alter history by producing AKs a hundred or so years early. You theoretically have the ability to do this, and certainly have enough of a technological basis to produce examples of the gun, but it doesnt mean you know how to build the lathes or stamping equipment required for mass production. Similarly, do you know how to mass produce things the gun will require, like smokeless powder and cased ammunition? Just knowing how an AK-47 works and how to build an AK-47 wouldn’t be enough — you'd have to know how to engineer machinery and draw brass, etc. etc.This is basically the case with the Emperor's situation in the 30k era. Mankind is undergoing a resurgence long after a cataclysmic, civilization-destroying event that was centered on many of the most developed human worlds. While Dark Age technology is still around, everyone directly responsible for it's creation or construction is probably long dead. The Emperor might as well be stuck in a time before much of it even existed, practically speaking.Hopefully that makes sense.I think that even if the Emperor has the capacity to rediscover or reinvent Dark Age technology, he is not particularly gifted at it and it requires a great amount of effort on his part.You can see a little evidence of this in the canon — not only does the Emperor not actually directly invent much, but most of it doesnt really work as planned. The Thunder warriors were flawed. The Primarchs were flawed. Space Marines are flawed. The webway, a potentially fantastic accomplishment, might have worked, but it literally required all of his efforts and attention to put together, and potentially might not have. There isn't really the constantly implied level of perfect genius there, especially considering he's lived through tens of thousands of years of human history — for much of which he is hinted at as being a series of religious and political leaders, not a scientist. Thousands of years after the fall of man is a little late to get a solid education or the skills required to create perfect devices.What you DO see is incremental improvements in his creations. The Thunder Warriors were unstable combat gods. His next attempts were the Primarchs, and perhaps the Custodians — the Primarchs being an improvement in every way, and the Custodians retaining the prowess of the Thunder Warriors but without retaining whatever issues plagued them.Both of these were improvements, but even ignoring the later issues, the Primarchs obviously weren't suited to mass production. It could be pretty easily extrapolated that the Custodians are also too expensive to mass produce, which led to the Emperor's third iteration: Space Marines. Representing the bare minimum of modifications required to make an individual human physically competitive against most of the enemies they will face, they compromise between mass production (and it's a pretty severe compromise) and functionality. The next iteration would be the primaris marines, an improved version created by people other than the Emperor.To me, there is simply not much evidence he could have recreated much of anything.Finally, while the Imperium is vast and has an unimaginable amount of resources at it's disposal, it seems unlikely that it could have produced Dark Age levels of technology on the scale required to be significantly useful during the 30,000s.The infamous saying is that you go to war with the army you have, and that applies here too. The minute the Imperium began to bring new planets and systems into the fold was the minute it began to require resources to control those systems. Even if all you need is an orbital outpost or a regiment of guardsmen, you need to provide the materials or equipment needed to assemble and supply them. You need to be apply to supply this stuff thousands and thousands of times over, at the bare minimum. This is not to mention the vast armies raised from them and required to subjugate them, or the ships to provision them, or any of a hundred other things.This is the type of footing the Imperial economy was on during the Emperor's direct reign. It was geared towards providing for these things, a real war economy, and not for the development of new things. While the investment this allowed in expansion would pay off eventually, and did to a degree, it's unlikely the Imperium experienced immediate benefits from most of it's new annexations. One of the biggest problems they currently face is that they’re still stuck on the war economy setting, and have never had the opportunity to make much for advancements in any other area.I think this is upheld in canon, too. Even if the Emperor were a giftes scientist, it could contribute to the relative stagnation of technological development after the Emperor was wounded — while he was able put the required effort into the development of much of the infrastructure and technology required for war, he had no chance to do much else in those regards. After his incapacitation, humanity was left with even less knowledge of truly advanced technology, and still could not afford to focus on independent rapid development of it or the means to produce it. Ten thousand years later, there is likely enough established control in many areas that an exceptional individual could co-ordinate the required resources, but few exist and none have the Emperors knowledge. The organization required to build this technology simply doesn’t exist. Even where relatively advanced things are produced, such as baneblades or plasma guns, they are unable to be truely mass produced.The value of STCs, even in 30k, seems to almost imply much of this too. Not only do they contain the designs for advanced technology, but they contain the required information on how to effectively mass produce it. Things like the Leman Russ (originally a tractor) and the Terminator armour (a mining suit) indicate that even when the Emperor was active, it was easier to adapt established designs intended for mass production and mundane purposes, than to use the technological insights learned from the STC to redevelop more specialized technology the Emperor may have been familiar with.Anyway, really long ramble.

The Speranza is one theseOne of the Arch Magos(What makes it even scarier was that the Eldar ship was guided by a Farseer(Let that sink in for a moment…It detected and targeted an enemy ship(with 100% accuracy mind you) in the middle of a storm that should’ve made such a feat impossible, and then teleported it back in time so that the shot would connect when the enemy ship saw into the future and originally dodged itAnd humanity went from that, to flashlights…That’s not grimdark, that’s just flat out tragic.Considering that the Imperium is mostly able to hold their own against the other factions with the current level of technology they have, actually being able to use technology from the Dark Age would result in them winning. They would rule the galaxy and no other faction would be able to stop them(Tldr: Humanity Wins.

If the aliens just provided “technology” then the answer might be different. But providing advanced weaponry indicates a deeper, more ulterior motive and that must be eliminated, even at high cost.There was once an episode of the Twilight Zone where aliens took an entire town into space, buildings, cars, people, everything for the purpose of finding a way to kill humans, but they needed the people alive to test them to find the most effective way to kill people. What did the people do? They committed mass suicide to save the earth.

This is the idea in the book “ UFO’s & Nukes,” where the author sites many reports where alien craft have been purported to have hovered over both US & Russian nuclear missile silos and rendered the nukes inside unable to be fired, with the electronic control systems no longer working, as if jammed by some unknown energy field. A You Tube search of it brings up plenty of videos about that.All enemy nuclear armed subs would need to have their nukes quickly disabled too. It really would need a massive first strike by the US on all enemy countries, but with no or little chance of any nukes or WMD’s from them being able to be used in response, unless the US was prepared to accept some degree of destruction and death too.They already have the high power microwave weapons which can be fired and cause the electronics to fail in such things as enemy tanks. The CHAMP system can use 6 inch shells that do the damage by electronic disabling means. Some claim an entire battle group of tanks can be disabled on the ground this electronic way. It is a far cry from any system that could quickly disable all the nukes in an entire country,plus locate submarines under the sea and disable their nukes too, but one day if ET can do it, humans might develop such advanced technology too.The various DEW (directed enbergy weapons) are the way warfare will be likely to go. Not so much that DEW's are likely to do more damage than nukes, just another diabolical set of weapons, and weapons that could be very precisely targetedA nuclear EMP by a nuke burst perhaps 120 miles above the Earth, could damage much of the electronics over a large country, but military electronics is hardened to withstand EMP up to a certain level.

Minus any of these clues we are simply left to wonder and be amazed by.Leading inevitably to speculation which in turn leads to wild statements which are unproven. We’ve seen it all.The only real possibility for us today is to throw out speculations as to how, why or what the intended purpose may have been and focus on what we, employing our existing explosion/combustion technology, can actually duplicate. Is it possible for us today to produce the exact same things? What would it take and how much would it cost for us to basically remake identical items using the same materials?This is where it gets really interesting. We would have to factor in just about everything. Engineering, manufacturing, planning and transportation along with a slew of other things. Nobody, absolutely nobody, produces finely cut precision channels in andecite (a very hard type of stone) and then introduces, somehow, approximately .250″ diameter holes w“Well, they had help. Aliens visited our planet, employing their advanced technology, etc.”Very sorry, but statements such as that are not a part of it.And so you must proceed from there. Just the planning alone (“This is what we’re going to do and how we’re going to do it.”) implies possession of engineering skills which also implies a profound understanding of mathematics, materials science and the development of manufacturing technologies designed to perform efficiently - and with exacting precision - to work the materials found strewn about these sites. For example, what modern, fully equipped machine shop located in North America (or anywhere else in the world) could do this today? If someone placed an order tomorrow for 15 identical, precision manufactured items, could it be done? It's not that complicated but requires a logical thought process, not overblown statements. And some willingness to see it thru.If something really important were suddenly to require us to duplicate these things, and we set out to do it, where might it lead us?
