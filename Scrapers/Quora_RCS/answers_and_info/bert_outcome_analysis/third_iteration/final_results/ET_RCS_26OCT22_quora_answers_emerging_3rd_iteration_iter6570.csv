Imagine just a small percentage of power leaking out of an infinite power source. That’s infinite leakage, the universe cooks, everybody dies. Frankly, I don’t see the universe cooking as a significant improvement, although I guess it could temporarily create new drive for cooling technology.Nor would a massively expensive power source be very interesting. Nuclear power is declining because it costs too much, this virtually infinite and very reliable power source needs to be cheap or no one will take much notice of it.In the end, the closest thing to your description that isn’t deadly and isn’t stupidly expensive is wind turbines and solar panels. We know what that technology is doing and can predict a gradual increase in output and a gradual reduction in price.",3 followers,Samuel Bateman,1.1K,102,56.4K,2020,https://www.quora.com/If-humanity-discovered-an-infinite-and-reliable-power-source-one-day-how-quickly-would-our-technology-evolve
1,I once heard Michio Kaku predict that within 50 years we’d have tabletop machines that would make stuff out of the fabric of space. I’m sure they ask him to make a few bold predictions to sell the series…That would be a great replacement for my 3d printer.

2,"Quite possibly our technological evolution would slow down and stagnate and maybe stop entirely.The reason for this is most of the impetus to developing new and improved technology is to overcome the limitations imposed by not having enough power.An infinite and reliable power source eliminates this problem.And it means we would be able to accomplish almost anything we wanted using just existing technology and brute force.As a result a lot of the creative energy of our civilization would be diverted away from developing new technology and instead to applying existing technology in ever biggerQuite possibly our technological evolution would slow down and stagnate and maybe stop entirely.The reason for this is most of the impetus to developing new and improved technology is to overcome the limitations imposed by not having enough power.An infinite and reliable power source eliminates this problem.And it means we would be able to accomplish almost anything we wanted using just existing technology and brute force.As a result a lot of the creative energy of our civilization would be diverted away from developing new technology and instead to applying existing technology in ever bigger enterprises.There is also potentially extreme danger, depending on how widely available the infinite power source is and howIf it was so widely available that any individual could get one, it means that every disturbed individual, every political terrorist, incel, religious fanatic, etc, with a grudge against the world, can cook up a doomsday weapon in their garage.A single warped mind could potentially extinguish all life on Earth if given access that kind of power.In which case, technological advancement would also stop.",36 followers,Adam Ambrozy,579,0,0,2020,https://www.quora.com/If-humanity-discovered-an-infinite-and-reliable-power-source-one-day-how-quickly-would-our-technology-evolve
3,"We already have one.Thermal vents along the seafloorIt is an inexhaustible virtually permanent source of hydroelectric power.It is there if we ever run out of oil and natural gas - like that would ever happen.It takes at least three generations to come to grips with the orders of magnitude change in a “paradigm shift”.The coldest water is still livable. An ice age would be catastrophic to terrestrial life, but merely incidental to those living under water.Super volcanoes would be catastrophic to terrestrial life, but merely incidental to those living under water with unlimited power.We already have one.Thermal vents along the seafloorIt is an inexhaustible virtually permanent source of hydroelectric power.It is there if we ever run out of oil and natural gas - like that would ever happen.It takes at least three generations to come to grips with the orders of magnitude change in a “paradigm shift”.The coldest water is still livable.

4,"Clarification! Evolution is never necessary.Biological evolution begins with a random event. ‘Random’ and ‘necessary’ are logical opposites as the former has no ‘direction’ and the latter does.AS to your question, evolution continues regardless of technology because it is a random event that is unaffected by technology as we think of it.Some of these technologies may replace characteristics that we think of as deficiencies, but this does not stop the process of natural evolution.","220,633 followers",Franklin Veaux,1.8K,47.3K,783M,2019,https://www.quora.com/If-humanity-discovered-an-infinite-and-reliable-power-source-one-day-how-quickly-would-our-technology-evolve

6,"We’re continuing to evolve physically.

7,"Sure, why not? I like to think T & S are a bit evolved now from where they were in 1969, and 1969 was a hell of a lot more pleasant than 1919, and so on.There is no reason to suggest that civilization on the whole will not evolve and be “better” over the decades.

9,"I do believe we are quickly becoming far too reliant upon things we can only have because of advances in technology. Just go back only as far as 30 years ago. The general public did not have cell phones or email. Imagine the changes I have seen throughout my 60 years of life.The year I was born, 1960, gasoline was .31 cents a gallon. In 1970 it was higher, yes, at .36 cents. Suddenly, a decade later, in 1980, it was almost 1.20 a gallon. In 1990, it did drop for a short while, averaging 1.15 dollars per gallon. Just one decade later, in the year 2000, it soared to 1.51 per gallon. A decade latI do believe we are quickly becoming far too reliant upon things we can only have because of advances in technology.

In 2008, gas prices actually topped out over 4 dollars per gallon, though, thankfully, it did go back down later.This is a reflection of the changes in technology and cost of living in order to continue to be able to buy these wonderful products that make life so convenient. Now, your teenager would go into seizures without their cells, tablets, or computers. God forbid they not have instant access to videos on YouTube or purchasing things on Amazon.Go camping? Without a portable fridge or toilet or shower? What do you mean by having to catch and dress or butcher my own meat? Plant vegetables, crawling around in the dirt? Don't you realize my nail job cost over $75?A huge portion of the population are essentially crippled by technology. People are alive today who would have died in the centuries before technology. Not many people believe in the “strongest will survive” lifestyle. We are able to perform miraculous things by the advances we have made in science. We are healthier. Smarter (or at least more learned) than ever before. Hell, we've even gone to the moon in manned spacecrafts.I, personally, do depend on technology for health reasons, somewhat. I have epilepsy, so some of these technological advances have been influential in lengthening my life span, though I can use natural resources to get medications to control my seizures. I do plant my own garden, and I know how to fish and hunt. I do enjoy camping, so I know how to use the minimum of technological doodads. I know how to build an off-grid homestead.That said, I'd rather buy some supplies at the store.","358,990 followers",Sean Kernan,2.6K,5.6K,727.1M,2020,https://www.quora.com/If-humanity-discovered-an-infinite-and-reliable-power-source-one-day-how-quickly-would-our-technology-evolve

11,"In my opinion, there will be no intelligent technological civilisation from an aquatic life form. The reason for this is in order to evolve into a technological civilisation, one will need the help of tools and in order to use any kind of tools, aquatic life forms will have to generate and use limbs comparable to hands, coupled with that they would also need to have a large brain. Usually a large brain will require more oxygen, this puts the aquatic life form at a disadvantage to evolve into very intelligent beings which can be comparable to humans.","17,170 followers",Pascal Morimacil,5.2K,4.3K,34.7M,2015,https://www.quora.com/If-humanity-discovered-an-infinite-and-reliable-power-source-one-day-how-quickly-would-our-technology-evolve
