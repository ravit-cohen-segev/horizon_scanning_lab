Human beings are probably at the point, where consumption is no longer a limiting factor but genetics is. Smaller people, are more efficient, tend to have less problems and live longer. If obesity wasn’t a factor then I would say there would be a very slow trend for smaller people to become proportional more prevalent.","220,626 followers",Franklin Veaux,1.8K,47.3K,783M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Do-you-think-humans-will-evolve-to-be-shorter-now-that-technology-has-removed-a-lot-of-the-needs-for-strength-and-height
1,"They didn’t, they evolvedWe don’t know exactly when we and our fellow apes diverged from other primates (including the various monkeys) to begin our own branch of the evolutionary tree but it may have been as long as 25–30 million years ago. That was when the common ancestor (of humans and monkeys, in your terms) lived.

3,"So where did your delusion that human evolution stopped when humans started using tools and technology come from? The paleontological evidence shows early stone tools in layers associated with early hominids, a quick Google search will give you loads of detail on this. If we restrict ourselves to Homo Sapiens (modern man), genetic evidence shows adaptations to a high cereal diet and adults drinking milk, a response to the move from hunter/gatherer to agricultural or pastural societies. Changing technologies doesn’t stop evolution, it simply modifies the evolutionary pressures for any one populSo where did your delusion that human evolution stopped when humans started using tools and technology come from?

4,"Well, we’ll always be part of the clade of hominids, the great apes. It would take a very long time to become a hominid that was no longer considered an ape but something else - maybe if we ever become energy beings.","2,288 followers",Emmanuel Fabella,2.8K,434,3M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Do-you-think-humans-will-evolve-to-be-shorter-now-that-technology-has-removed-a-lot-of-the-needs-for-strength-and-height
5,"At the current technological level, the only thing that can wipe the human race is probably the meteor collision. If that happens technology dies instantly.But if that happens after we have been to other planets and started living, than the tech will keep on going no matter what.","66,695 followers",Dima Vorobiev,8.2K,4.2K,139M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Do-you-think-humans-will-evolve-to-be-shorter-now-that-technology-has-removed-a-lot-of-the-needs-for-strength-and-height
6,"Thoughts and Technology produced by thoughts will never end. It is like a kaleidoscope, turn it you get a new design. So it will evolve.

7,"In terms of continuous innovation, I don’t think it is going to stop anytime soon. Whenever there is a new disruptive innovation (e.g. automobile), it has a ripple effect on the whole world and it alters the way we look at the world. With the age of automobile, it fundamentally changed the structure of our society. No horse carriages meant cleaner cities, more freedom to travel meant less unity in families etc. More people had cars, so it gave rise to the fossil fuel industry which became an environmental and ecological threat. To solve this, we are now bringing electric automobile technology.In terms of continuous innovation, I don’t think it is going to stop anytime soon.

8,"Good things or bad things are human judgements, and matter not at all to the universe, or as I call it, reality. Evolution is pretty much how everything works in this universe. The universe evolves, galaxies evolve, solar systems evolve, planets evolve, life evolves, societies evolve, and even revealed religions evolve (eventually). Whether we like it or not, this is the universe into which we were born; love it or hate it, the universe doesn’t care.","220,626 followers",Franklin Veaux,1.8K,47.3K,783M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Do-you-think-humans-will-evolve-to-be-shorter-now-that-technology-has-removed-a-lot-of-the-needs-for-strength-and-height

11,"We are not as smart as we believe.Sure we can go to the moon and make iPhones but that's a short sighted view of smartness.If you define smartness as being able to live within one’s means, or to live sustainably then we are one of the least smart species.If you define it as being able to live your life without destroying the lives of the other living beings around you, then we are again one of the least smart.",1 follower,Kirk Scott,1.3K,13.4K,68.2M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Do-you-think-humans-will-evolve-to-be-shorter-now-that-technology-has-removed-a-lot-of-the-needs-for-strength-and-height

14,"Interesting question. For starters, up through the 1800s and pretty much until about 1930 or so, hospitals were pretty much places people went to die.

16,"Absolutely.All it takes is for the less intelligent to be more successful at producing viable offspring. And many fear that this is already happening.Of course, it wouldn’t be a permanent move.
