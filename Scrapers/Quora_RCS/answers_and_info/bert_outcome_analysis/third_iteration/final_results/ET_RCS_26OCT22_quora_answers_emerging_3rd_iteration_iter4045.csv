1,"Perhaps, but not necessarily.It’s true that this scenario would have avoided what are popularly known as the ‘Dark Ages’.However, civilisations are capable of remaining at the same level of technology for centuries.A Roman empire that had lasted for more than 1,500 years could have easily become resistant to change, and particularly to the Scientific Revolution that led in turn to the Industrial Revolution.",4 followers,Eric Wang,3K,1.1K,22M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Which-kind-of-social-and-technological-advancements-could-have-made-the-Roman-empire-at-its-peak-able-to-reach-the-modern-age-as-a-single-political-entity-or-with-minor-border-changes

The modern concept of border was created with theEurope in the XI centuryNow, get one of those maps you can see in history books, with all of those nice colors and carefully drawn kingdoms and empires. That’s a mystification. You look at it with your XXI century brain and think “Here ends Hungary and starts Poland, there is a border”. No, there wasn’t. There was a limes, an area (that could have been wider or narrower) of no man’s land, where the power of both kingdoms vanished and morphed into the other. For several (sometimes several hundred kilometers) nobody was in charge.Usually this limes coincided with a physical boundary: a sea, a major river, a mountain chain, a desert, an area so barren that it could not be used for agriculture. Sometimes it was just an area over which the two states were at war on. In the X century the Byzantine Empire was split up between different empires born of a big civil war (it would be soon reunited) and it was also at war with Bulgaria over the control of the lands that constituted the limes. These were good, fertile lands that the two states both wanted.Italy in the XI centuryWhere the population was thicker, the limes was narrower. The limes also moved with alliances and small wars. Canossa was formally in the Duchy of Tuscany, but if a lord of Canossa (at the time a major fortress) would switch sides and forge a new alliance with the Kingdom of Lombardy, the whole limes would change accordingly. The limes was a far more liquid concept than a border.So, how did a Roman guy know whether he was still inside the Empire? In a sense he could not. The Empire itself was not what the maps show us. If you look at a modern map of Brazil (for instance) you know that the whole area within the border is Brazil, and that’s all. It was not so in ancient times.The pink Roman Empire was actually a composite territory made of the Pomerium, which kind of formally belonged to the city or Rome, of the colonies, that were Roman cities and whose inhabitants (often including the rustics that lived in the countryside) were Roman citizens, and of lands that were variously influenced by Rome, but sometimes retained a local power structure (that was the case, for instance, for Palestine). Even within the limes you didn’t know exactly if in a certain place you were within the Rome domains, or within an area over which Rome merely had a heavy influence.Once you neared the limes all you knew is that you were on the limes, so Roman protection was not assured. On the other hand, the limes was often so unimportant that nobody went there except for a few sheep herders, merchants going to sell Roman Goods to the “tribes” (which were not really tribes, but let’s stick with the myth for the moment being) and some bandits.",22 followers,Spencer McDaniel,2.1K,2.1K,61.5M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Which-kind-of-social-and-technological-advancements-could-have-made-the-Roman-empire-at-its-peak-able-to-reach-the-modern-age-as-a-single-political-entity-or-with-minor-border-changes
3,"They didn’t know when to quit.In 387 BCE, Rome’s walls were breached by Brennus’ Gauls. Their city was burnt to the ground, and they had to pay him a massive sum of gold to get him to leave. Reportedly Brennus had the scales used to weigh the gold tampered with, and when the Romans complained of this, he threw his sword onto the scale, and said “Woe to the conquered.”Did the Romans abandon their ruined city to start a life elsewhere?

Did they disperse and become citizens of another city, leaving Rome a mere footnote in history?No.They rebuilt the city, brick by brick. There were no nicely-laid plans. It was all very messy and disorganized, and everyone seemed to be making their own independent efforts. But they managed to recover, and fought off all attacks from opportunistic neighbors. Rome lived to fight another day.In 321 BCE, one of Rome’s main armies entered the Caudine Forks mountain pass, and were trapped inside by a Samnite army. They surrendered without a fight. Rome had gotten a large portion of their fighting men captured.The Samnite commander asked his father what he should do with the captives. His father told him “Let them all go.” He doubted this, and so sent another letter for confirmation. His father’s advice had changed to “Kill them all.” He asked his father in person about this, and he stated that if he let them go, Rome would be indebted to Samnium forever. The second best choice, he said, was to wipe out a big chunk of Rome’s fighting men, so that they wouldn’t pose a threat for at least a generation.The commander decided to let them go, but not before disarming them and forcing them to walk under the yoke.Rome was furious, and plotted revenge immediately.Once again, the Romans pulled themselves back from this dishonorable peace to win the Second Samnite War.In 216 BCE, Rome was reeling from a defeat against Carthage. They had lost 80,000 young men in a single day. Some estimate that this accounted for 20% of the adult male population of Rome. This defeat came hot on the heels of two previous defeats in 218 and 217 BCE, where the Romans lost 60,000 men total.Did the Romans surrender?Had any other nation lost 20% of its adult male population on a single day, they would have surrendered on the spot. But not Rome.They fought on.And 14 years later, they would be at the gates of Carthage itself.Rome’s determination was insurmountable. You could kill their men, destroy their armies, sack their cities, but you could never break their fighting spirit.",912 followers,Élise Petras,789,1.3K,4.8M,2017,https://www.quora.com/Which-kind-of-social-and-technological-advancements-could-have-made-the-Roman-empire-at-its-peak-able-to-reach-the-modern-age-as-a-single-political-entity-or-with-minor-border-changes

You have to pull these soldiers fromWhich was the entire reason why heroes like Wolverine exist. He had no family and was just a drifter, someone no-one would miss, until Stryker turned him into Weapon X.But then again, perhaps the technology to create “super-soldiers” is pretty far-fetched, even in fiction a technology that transforms ordinary men into levitating demi-gods might simply be implausible.Take Jason Bourne for example: in the films, the Treadstone operatives are subjected to a rigorous regime of classical conditioning that breaks the agents down psychologically until they simply cannot disobey orders anymore; and they (for the most part) ignore Pain, Confusion, Fatigue, Doubt, and Fear — thus by eliminating a soldier's greatest weaknesses, they become Super Soldiers, invisible assassins in an international, shadowy war.In later Bourne films, the Treadstone project was updated to produce even better soldiers through a kind of gene therapy, trying to create ideal supersoldiers without all the weaknesses of the original method.Both classical conditioning as well as gene therapy are familiar sciences, and have been around for a substantial amount of time.It is much more believable to improve ordinary soldiers using these methods than wholly mutating human beings into other artificial species just to use them in combat.I hope this helps!",0 followers,Jim Hogarth,10.5K,94,5.5M,2013,https://www.quora.com/Which-kind-of-social-and-technological-advancements-could-have-made-the-Roman-empire-at-its-peak-able-to-reach-the-modern-age-as-a-single-political-entity-or-with-minor-border-changes

Why that sign says “men”! Hmph! She’s going to give that working class guy a lesson and teach him how to be woke while he’s trying to do his dangerous lower paying job, because you just know he’s running duh patriarchy!We liberals have too many of these god damned ivory tower dwelling idiots setting the political narratives associated with us, and not enough people who actually know a god damned thing about what it’s like to be a blue-collar worker, what their struggles are, and how much less privilege they actually have than little miss privileged clueless first world princess there and people like her.Guys like me who try to change the narrative? Yeah, shut down. I get accused of “mansplaining” to all the privileged middle and upper class “victims” throwing down their Chase Palladium Victim cards faster than you can say “pink razors cost 40 cents more!”.Think about it… What do these types of people say that will in any way address the struggles that blue collar workers face? The male workers hear: “You are all unfairly benefitting from the patriarchy and the system works for you” from people who have objectively easier lives than them. The female workers hear: “Those men - your fathers, your brothers, your husbands, your sons… yeah, the ones you see working their asses off day in and day out, they have an unfair advantage over you. The system works for them, and they’re the reason you don’t have nice things.

We got to stick together, girl power, vote the way I tell you to!”EDIT - A couple of comments asserting that assistant professors don’t make that much and/or construction workers make more. Not according to the stats I’ve been able to find (the following are from glassdoor.com):Salary: Construction WorkerSalary: Assistant ProfessorI didn’t just check one site either (from work.chron.com):Utility Construction SalaryThe Average Pay for an Assistant Professor at a UniversityThese last three numbers are derived from data from 2011–2012.This brings up another point that ties into answering the original question. An assistant professor is in the privileged position of having a job that can’t be filled by an illegal immigrant and can’t be outsourced to foreign labor. So they can analyze those issues and form opinions on them in a very detached, non personal way.A lot of these well off privileged liberals who spout these identity narratives promoted by the likes of Princess Caitlyn, from Hollywood types, to academia, to medicine… they not only don’t face downward pressure on their wages by illegal immigration and foreign competition, they actually get to save money by hiring them when they need stuff done around their homes, and they enjoy the cost savings in foreign made products.None of the risk, all of the reward, while talking as if their stance is a moral one, completely blind to the fact that many blue collar workers (of all colors, of all genders, of all sexual orientations) face real life ramifications to their livelihoods by these “moral stances” on immigration, whereas they (the privileged liberals) don’t face any ramifications to their livelihoods and in fact, they mostly benefit from it.The cherry on top?

They are generally well-respected by all but the most rude patients. No, apparently you do not.I fail to understand your shame at people who are bilingual, educateI’m not Filipino, but I’m married to one. In my family are a large number of medical professionals…. including nurses.

What would you have them do … stay home and play the lottery?You also neglected to mention all the Filipinos who work in the shipping and hotel industries worldwide… virtually EVERY cruise ship in the USA, and hotels in Dubai would be in serious trouble without their Filipino employees.I have more respect for a hard-working blue-collar worker than a lazy white-collar one who doesn’t recognize courage and dedication. I’ve worked with plenty of those…. and have felt embarrassment when they shame their country by looking down on others without cause.",18 followers,Asim Qureshi,8.7K,996,156M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Why-are-super-soldiers-usually-peak-humans-in-most-Superhero-fiction-Why-cant-the-Government-just-use-technology-to-produce-Mutant-Metahuman-soldiers-I-E-Captain-America-and-X-Men

If you start going there, they will smile when you walk in. If you start going there on a regular basis, they will quickly learn your name and call you by it when you walk in.Additionally, employees will learn the nuances of your taste, your favorite sandwich andEvery time I eat there, even if I spend more money than planned, I feel like I’ve been treated well and my dollars were well spent. There’s never a post-meal bitter taste, figuratively or literally.About a quarter mile from my house is a local convenience store.We commonly refer to it as Hell Mart.The man behind the desk is typically impersonal, listening to sports radio, taking his sweet time to ring you up. Upon checkout, he hands your change back without a smile, word, or any form of amiable human communication.It is unfortunate, because the place was so damn conveniently close.The straw that broke the proverbial camel’s back happened when I went in to buy ice cream from one of these refrigerated bins:(Although the one in question was far more hideous, I can assure you.)Upon grabbing the ice cream bar I realized it had melted, and the entire bin was unplugged.At the counter I said, “Hello - just a heads up. Your ice cream machine was left unplugged. Everything is probably melted or close to it. It probably needs to be replaced.”I’d venture there’s standard protocol response in situation: perhaps “Thank you” and a service call to replace everything, or plugging the machine back in.To his credit, the latter happened: I know because he said “Okay” and walked over and nonchalantly plugged the electrical cord back into the wall.A week later, I returned and tested my hypothesis that none of the ice cream had been replaced. I even reached and got a cone from the very bottom to give the shop a fighting chance.Not so.It was the sheer nastiness of ice cream that has been fully melted and refrozen. That was the last day I walked into that store.This store recently went out of business.Meanwhile, the sandwich shop is thriving and has three more locations.Respect your customers (or watch your business die).",18 followers,Asim Qureshi,2.4K,996,156M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Why-are-super-soldiers-usually-peak-humans-in-most-Superhero-fiction-Why-cant-the-Government-just-use-technology-to-produce-Mutant-Metahuman-soldiers-I-E-Captain-America-and-X-Men
19,"To answer your question, let’s first define what blue collar jobs are and what white collar jobs are.Blue collar jobs is work that usually involves physical labor in some way.White collar jobs is work that usually involves mental labor in some way.As an auditor, I have a typical white collar job. I spend most of time at a desk, sit in an air-conditioned office, and spend most of my time on a computer. I work 40 hours a week and work the typical Monday to Friday schedule. I have several college degrees.

I spend most of time at a desk, sit in an air-conditioned office, and spend most of my time on a computer. I work 40 hours a week and work the typical Monday to Friday schedule. I have several college degrees. I get paid about $34 an hour if you were to work out my salary, which is a bit below what others in public auditing make since I work for the state. Senior Internal Auditors make around $40 to $50 dollars an hour if they work for public companies.Now let’s look at some blue collar jobs out there.My air conditioner for my house was freezing up, so I called my AC guy up, he charged me $150 to put freon in my system because I had a slow leak. I have no idea what the freon cost him, but he was there a grand total of 5 minutes. If the freon cost him $50, and he spent 25 minutes travelling to my house and his next house to put freon in, he was making $100 an hour.I had an issue where everytime we flushed the toilet it backed up into the tub. I called a plumber who put a camera down our sewer lines only to discover that it was a blockage in the main sewer lines, which was the city’s problem. He was at my house for maybe 15 minutes and charged me $300 for something the city ended up having to fix.When I was the manager at Wendy’s, I had a customer brag to me that he made $90 an hour for doing welding on a federal government building that required that they pay local union wages.I have a friend that retired a millionaire because he had a landscaping business that he had built up to include multiple lawn care teams that he sold when he was in his 50s. He started mowing lawns by himself in his 20s.My son-in-law showed me a video of his father’s boat with a $20,000 light LED package that displayed lights based on the music being played. The “boat” was one step below being classified as a yacht. His dad has an electrical company that deals with mostly industrial electric work, but his dad started it twenty year ago mainly wiring houses. His company still contracts to wire housing units, but they no longer concentrate on those kind of contracts.I saw a Youtube video where there are people that do underwater repairs to oil rigs out at sea that make $300 an hour.While I like my job, if I were ever unemployed again, the real money is in blue collar work, and I would pursue a career in that.","135,533 followers",Hector Quintanilla,1.6K,1.2K,88.6M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Why-are-super-soldiers-usually-peak-humans-in-most-Superhero-fiction-Why-cant-the-Government-just-use-technology-to-produce-Mutant-Metahuman-soldiers-I-E-Captain-America-and-X-Men

I had 4 other coworkers. My job in particular was to empty waste barrels throughout the plant, keep the mixing room stocked with yeast (50 lb. boxes) and of course sweep floors. On Monday and Friday nights we cleaned all machines as they shut down (Tuesdays and Saturdays were our day’s off). I was often used as a “floater” to give people breaks, and in the summer, if someone called in sick, I’d fill their spot (only a few machine operator spots were unavailable to someone under 18)It was also cool seeing “behind the curtain” on how such items are made.After high school graduation, I enlisted in the USAF. Who knew that my janitorial skills would prove to be so useful! Those floors didn't buff themselves. Here is me applying those skills in Korea…Note: I also had a blue-collar job running a plastics extruder in the 90’s, but it was a second, part-time job for one year. Then I got a part-time job teach electronics.","135,533 followers",Hector Quintanilla,1.9K,1.2K,88.6M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Why-are-super-soldiers-usually-peak-humans-in-most-Superhero-fiction-Why-cant-the-Government-just-use-technology-to-produce-Mutant-Metahuman-soldiers-I-E-Captain-America-and-X-Men
