Also, on the other side, new technologies in solar bring a promise of better generation, more flexibility and innovation coupled with seamless adaptability across various topographies and landscapes.Let us discuss some major solar technologies which have been introduced or are already in the pipeline.Floating solar:Floating solar power plants, or floatovoltaics are solar power plants which are installed on water bodies like reservoirs, dams or lakes. Such installations are more economical by way of capital cost saving as the need for costly land and real estate is substituted when the plant is installed on water.Ground and roof-top installations require more fabrication for mounting the panels compared to installation of a floating plant. This results in savings in cost, manpower and resources.Solar panels lose generation efficiency in high temperatures. Floatovoltaics, due to their proximity to water, have cooler surroundings, hence giving better generation and faster payback time.As a floatovoltaics plant covers the water surface, blocking sunlight, it stops the photosynthesis process, stopping the growth of algae resulting in the water staying clean. This coverage also helps in reducing the evaporation of water which helps in saving this valuable resource.BIPV & BAPV:Building Integrated Photovoltaics serve in a dual-purpose manner, as an outer layer of the façade of buildings and as a source of electricity generation. As they can be integrated during the initial construction of a building, they save on construction costs by replacing certain standard materials. Besides helping in generating electricity, BIPVs do not disturb the aesthetics of a building but merge seamlessly into the design elements.Building-Added Photovoltaics are added during a retrofit. Both BIPV and BAPV do not require the racks and mounting equipment of traditional solar PV systems, ultimately saving on costs.Solar Skin:A very dynamic innovative design by MIT engineers, Solar Skin uses selective light filtering to simultaneously display a vibrant image and transmit sunlight to the underlying solar panel with minimal loss of efficiency. Due to this revolutionary feature, it can blend across variety of surfaces and preserve the aesthetics of the surroundings along with efficient functioning.Solar Fabric:Imagine every fabric of the clothing you wear being able to harness the power of the sun. Such fabric has the potential to keep your winter jacket warm, power your phone while in the pocket, even light up lamps from the awnings and generate electricity from window curtains eliminating the cost of setting up solar structures and mountings. Once this technology is developed and feasible the possibilities of its applications are endless.Solar Powered Roads:Solar powered roads are a reality now. They are being designed and built not only for their ability to generate clean energy but they would also power LED street lights during the night and in cold countries they can be designed to have thermal heating capacity to melt snow.Beginning from ground mounted and roof mounted systems, today solar has come a long way. Solar is now more efficient, more flexible and more customization with better applicability across various surfaces. Solar is here to stay and the future is nothing but bright.","20,171 followers",Sriraman Madhavan,4.1K,186,7.9M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-do-you-think-is-the-most-recent-and-emerging-technology-in-providing-eLearning-EdTech
4,"We once arrived at someone's house to find the door wide open and the lady (approx 30) lying near the front door. We asked her to sit on the couch and she got up straight away. She said she had a sore stomach and that it was incredibly painful. She said she'd never been in so much pain in her entire life (even though she had 2 children)She then revealed that she'd had a colonoscopy earlier that day. The brochure she showed us said there would be ‘mild discomfort' after the procedure - talk about over-reacting…We couldn't believe the big deal she was making about a stomach ache!

We told her to take some paracetamol and go to bed (it was night time).We left.Five hours later she called a friend to drive her to the ER. It turns out they had ruptured her colon during the colonoscopy and her feces had been entering her abdomen all night. It took six hours of surgery to clean it all out - part by part - and then put her back together again.Unfortunately, I'm not really a paramedic - I'm the girl. And because of the no feedback policy, the emergency responders will never know the mistake they made that night. They went home thinking I'd called because of a mild stomach ache.Some calls that may have seemed ‘exaggerated' may have turned out not to be!",1 follower,Susan Harding,7.7K,78,942.6K,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-do-you-think-is-the-most-recent-and-emerging-technology-in-providing-eLearning-EdTech

6,"Seriously? In a country where owning guns is a right guaranteed by the Constitution, and the enormous number of guns in circulation it is ridiculous to expect an armed police force to go away. Plus, unarmed emergency responders simply stay away from or evacuate from areas where criminals shoot at or attack them. There is no reason that an unarmed person should be expected to replace the armed police that we have.While there is the need for police reform in many departments, not all police are bad cops. Better to fix what is broken than to toss it out.","220,628 followers",Franklin Veaux,694,47.3K,783M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-do-you-think-is-the-most-recent-and-emerging-technology-in-providing-eLearning-EdTech

The size of rockets required would be considerably less, but there remains a combination of problems for such a mission:To achieve the necessary speed and positioning to get to it would call for some combination of a large, multi-stage rocket to launch from Earth’s surface, and a series of close encounters with other planets in a manner that transfers momentum to the probe in the right way to give it the right speed.We typically take roughly ten years to design and manufacture a probe, which is already much more time than we would have from first detection until the body whizzes through the Solar System. A sequence of gravitational boosts by close encounters with various planets takes a multiple of the orbital period(s) of the planet(s) used, so there we are looking at another five to fifteen years (with much room for variation) to get up to speed. We simply would not have time to go through with all that before the object was gone.The only alternative is a very large, multistage system, capable of accelerating the probe to enormous speeds without gravitational boosting. I think this would be far larger than any rocket available at present. Maybe it could be assembled in Earth orbit, thus saving some of the required size.Then, this huge, expensive assembly would have to sit and wait, on Earth or maybe in orbit, until another interstellar body comes along. We would then have to hope thatIn spite of the unknown wait, I think this is a somewhat more realistic scenario that trying to catch Oumuamua.",15 followers,Mike Miller,763,10.7K,51.1M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-do-you-think-is-the-most-recent-and-emerging-technology-in-providing-eLearning-EdTech
10,"It could be done. If you used the largest boosters we had available, say the twin falcon, and used in space refueling, you could get a relatively lightweight interception vehicle flung out towards Jupiter.Using a sling-shot orbit around Jupiter you could get the small probe headed out towards a rendezvous with Oumuamua.The probe would also need the strongest most efficient Ion drive motor we can make in the limited time.Still, we take ten years to perfect the probes and technology for space refueling, we are likely looking at somewhere around year 2089′ before we have any chance of catching upIt could be done.
