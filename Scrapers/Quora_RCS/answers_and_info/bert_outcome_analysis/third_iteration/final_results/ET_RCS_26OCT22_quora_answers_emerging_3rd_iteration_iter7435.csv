Cryptocurrencies tend to show wide changes in their prices over relatively short periods. It is risky – but high profits are always sure, and such potential is hard to find in other assets. Many people lose money in cryptotrading because they try to do it without any professional guidance. This is where i also erred in the past and it cost me alot.

Opposing theories exist on how cryptocurrencies would behave in the event of a crash – after all, they emerged after the 2008 crash (and as a reaction to it). Some experts believe they will thrive.•Your money is yours aloneCryptocurrencies offer you a level of independence impossible with other means. When you keep your money in a bank, you are at the mercy of other people and organizations. At any moment, your access to the money that is rightfully yours can be limited or closed by the bank outside of governmental structures. The bank can be robbed or go bankrupt. In the long run, it can become the basis of a truly open and decentralized economy. By investing now, you can be at the forefront of it all.•High liquidityOne of the primary characteristics of any asset is its liquidity – that is, how easy it is to purchase or sell it at a price close to the market rate. By their very nature, cryptocurrencies have very high liquidity – you can quickly and easily buy and sell them, and the technological organization of trading platforms allows the use of a wide variety of tools and tactics, such as limit-orders (automated buying and selling at a specified price) and algorithm-based trading.•SimplicityGetting into any kind of investment, be it stocks, bonds, or something else entirely, is traditionally complicated, bothersome, and time-consuming. Many investment opportunities (for example, real estate) have an extremely high entry threshold – you cannot just invest 100 bucks; you need a much more significant sum at your disposal to even get started.In summary, It’s always a yes to invest in cryptocurrency for me because i have earned alot trading cryptocurrency especially bitcoin through the aid of the professional 𝖫𝖺𝗎𝗋𝖺 𝖣𝖺𝗅𝗒 𝖱𝗒𝖺𝗇.

I invest a number of my cryptocurrencies with the Coinstarhaven company (www.coinstarhaven,com), a trusted and actively paying investment company where you get double your investments in 7 days.The early days of Bitcoin mining are often described as a gold rush.Satoshi Nakomoto’s invention of Bitcoin, “a peer-to-peer electronic cash system,” opened up an entirely new frontier, not just of freedom but of occasionally outrageous profits.Those with a strong interest in such things, namely cypherpunks, cryptographers, technically-minded libertarians and assorted hackers, were first to stake their claim.But is there still gold in them thar hills?The fact is:Bitcoin mining has grown from a handful of early enthusiasts into a cottage industry, into a specialized industrial-level venture. The easy money was scooped out a long time ago and what remains is buried under the cryptographic equivalent of tons of hard rock.The sad truth is:Only those with specialised, high-powered machinery are able to profitably extract bitcoins nowadays. While mining is still technicallyIn other words, mining won’t beWe’ll explain this situation in depth but first, you need to know a few basic technical terms from the world of Bitcoin mining:Block:A group of Bitcoin transactions, chosen fromA new block is created on average every ten minutes.Proof of Work Hashing:This is the cryptographic work which miners perform in order to find the solution which allows them to define a new block.PoW hashing ensures the proper function of the Bitcoin blockchain. Miners compete to solve a cryptographic “puzzle,” known as aThere are no shortcuts in this process, which can only be solved with raw computational power.By correctly hashing the current block, minersBlock Reward:The number of newly-created bitcoins, awarded to whichever miner creates a block.This number was initially set to 50, halved to 25 in late-2012, and halved again to 12.5 in mid-2016. The next halving event expected is around mid-2020.This halving process will continue in this fashion, halving the block reward approximately every four years / 210,000 blocks, until all 21 million bitcoins are created.Achieving the block reward is the only valid way in which new bitcoins can be created; by miners according to the code’s rate and limit.Hashrate:Hashrate is the measure of a miner’s computational power.The higher their relative power, the more solutions (and hence, block rewards) a miner is likely to find.Initially measured in hash per second (In early 2017, Bitcoin’s collective hashrate reached nearly 4 Exahash. This represents a tremendous investment into mining hardware, the R&D of such hardware, and electrical expenditure.Difficulty:With hashrate shooting up over the years, it would seem blocks would be found by miners ever more rapidly.Bitcoin’s Difficulty measure is what prevents this from happening. It adjusts to hashrate to ensure that blocks are found roughly every 10 minutes.Note how closely Difficulty matches Hashrate in the 2 charts above.When total hashrate rises, the Difficulty of POW hashing adjusts upwards – and the inverse also applies.Difficulty auto-adjusts every two weeks (or 2016 blocks).BTC / XBT exchange rate:The current fiat price of Bitcoin is critical for calculating profitabilityW/xHash/s:Watts per hashrate per second. Electricity is the major on-going cost of Bitcoin mining. The price paid per Watt will greatly influence profitability.Mining Pool:Unless you command a tremendous hashrate, your odds of solving a block by yourself (i.e. “solo-mining”) are extremely low.By banding together with other miners in a so-called pool, your combined odds of solving a block rise proportional to the pool’s total hashrate.Whenever they solve blocks, pools reward individual miners according to their contributed hashrate (minus commissions and the like).Calculating Mining ProfitabilityWith these terms in mind, it’s possible to calculate the current profitability (circa March 2017) of Bitcoin mining for your circumstances.Note:TheThis is due to the ever-changing nature of the Difficulty modifier and the BTC price, in particular.To begin, we must select a suitable ASIC mining rig. To aid in selection, the Bitcoin Wiki provides a handy mining hardware comparison:Although Bitcoin Wiki doesn’t list many models as currently shipping on from their manufacturers, all these mining rigs (and more) are available for resale as new or used.The Bitmain AntMiner S9 is a modern mining rig which offers a good hashrate for its power consumption.It’s pretty much the cutting edge of mining tech so we’ll select it for our example.The S9 is available for roughly $1800 up to $2400 from Amazon, or about $1365 from BitMain, shipping excluded. Power supply units will add another $120 or so to the price.Next, we need to enter the S9’s specs and cost, as well as other info such as power cost and pool fees, into a suitable number-cruncher.Cryptocurrency Mining vs. Bitcoin Mining Profitability offers a good mining profitability calculator, which automatically fills in the currentScenario 1: Big Chinese MinersWe are using the defaultTo determine your own power cost, check worldwide electricity prices or your utility bill for the exact price.The 0%Once all the necessary info is entered, hitAn excellent result! At this rate, the S9 unit would pay for itself within a year as well as make about $600 in profit! As a large miner would be able to negotiate a lower unit price on each S9, we can assume they’ll research profit even sooner.Scenario 2: An American Hobby MinerBefore getting too excited about your potential mining profits, let’s recalculate them using the average residential power cost per kWh in the USA (~12.5c) and a typical pool fee of 1%.The result:It’s not looking so great now.At a Bitcoin price around $1150, it appears that the average American home miner makes only $1348 a year, assuming difficulty and price hold steady. In other words, the unit will pay for itself within a year.However:This is a dangerous assumption! Bitcoin’s total hashrate – and thus its difficulty, has been consistently rising since the early years, sometimes jumping by double digit percentages within a month!Therefore, any calculations should be regarded skeptically, as likely best-case scenarios.Sources ofDifficulty Spikes, Price Crashes, Equipment Failures, Power Cuts, Shipping Delays & More!Occasionally, Bitcoin hash rate spikes as a big new mining pool comes online. This happened in early 2016:It’s quite possible that even some big, corporate miners found their profit margins under threat from the resulting steep spike in competition. Indeed, in mid-2016, Swedish Bitcoin mining firm KnCMiner declares BankruptcyThe home miner really has no chance to compete in such a challenging environment, unless they have access to free or extremely low-cost electricity…Also bear in mind that the rate of obsolescence in Bitcoin mining hardware is quite fast! New, more efficient mining hardware may be released at any time, although we are reaching the technological limits of improved efficiencies.If pre-ordering any such equipment, be aware that potential manufacturing, shipping, customs or other delays could end up being very costly as difficulty rises or price falls during the interim.There are plenty of other things which can wrong, for example:Such downside risks must always be factored into any sound business plan.","84,992 followers",Adam Fayed,18.5K,3.6K,476.7M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Is-it-a-good-idea-to-invest-in-cryptocurrencies-right-now

It looks too good to be true until i gave it a try and trust me it has been a smooth ride all the way. Don’t give up on cryptocurrency and join the platform. Trust me, you won’t care about the price fluctuation anymore. Thank me Later.PS: This is not in any case of me trying to lure you into anything for my own personal financial gain, i am just innocently sharing so that you could gain one or two things as this has been working for me. You can also make a research on what works for you too.1It Will Be the Main Currency in the FutureOne thing that the economic crisis of 2008 showed us is that traditional banking systems are flawed. And it’s been confirmed in 2020. More and more people are seeing the need for viable alternatives. And that’s exactly what crypto offers — a secure, decentralized form of banking, that takes governments and banks out of the equation.And the crazy thing is, that even banks realize it. Just listen to what Germany’s Deutsche Bank have to say. In their ‘Imagine 2030’ report, they talk about how fragile the traditional money system is — that by 2030, over 200 million people will be using digital money — and by then, traditional money will already be on the way out.And it’s not just Deutsche Bank. Twitter’s Jack Dorsey has said he believes Bitcoin will eventually become the world’s single currency. Elon Musk has stated that ‘crypto is a far better way to transfer value than a piece of paper.’ China State TV has called Blockchain — the technology that makes crypto possible — 10 times more valuable than the internet.2You Need to Get Familiarized With the TechnologyIt’s the biggest technological invention since the internet. So, if you ‘re still not up to speed with it, you’re behind. But the good news is, you’re still in time to start playing catch-up.Just like in the 90s, when the internet was taking off, there were those who resisted adapting to it. There will be those people with the blockchain and crypto revolution — but do you really want to be one of them?And just like we now rely on the internet for information and communications — soon it’s going to be the same for financial transactions using blockchain. So if you’re not familiar with using it yet now’s the time — what are you waiting for?3You will position yourself better for opportunities in this spaceSure, you can make and receive payments with a crypto account. You can use it to save. But the really big opportunities come with investing in crypto.Just take a look at Bitcoin. If you’d invested $100 in it just 5 years ago, by now that $100 would be worth $2 500. Or if you’d got in really early with that $100 ten years ago, be worth $1.9 million.The price of Bitcoin is still set to keep on going up. Sure, with blips here and there. And to be fair, probably not as dramatically as it did before. Other cryptocurrencies like Ethereum, Litecoin, Dash, Ripple and Lisk also have huge potential to grow, and bring great returns to savvy investors.But to know which coins to invest in, and when you do need to get educated — and get some experience under your belt. So why waste any time? Now’s the time to get crypto-savvy and learn to spot the opportunities — because you can be sure, there are huge opportunities waiting.4It’s a Solid Alternative for Saving Your MoneyWe’ve already talked about crypto’s long-term upwards trend. Let’s compare that with regular money. If you took $100 in cash, buried it, and waited 10 years, the amount you could buy with it a decade later could be a lot less than when you put it in the ground. Because of inflation. And leaving it in a bank account isn’t going to be much better — if at all. Because of the interest rates in bank accounts, which vary from zero to extremely low.Disclaimer — yes, crypto is more volatile than most currencies, largely because it’s still new, and gaining traction. Like at the start of 2018 when the price of Bitcoin tanked. Remember, it’s more or less recovered since then. And it’s upward trend is likely to continue, and win out on any volatility. And that’s what makes it such a great option for long-term saving — something that will beat any interest rated banks can give you.5You Are Safe From InflationSo, we were just talking about inflation. Let’s spell that out in full. The problem with traditional money is that it’s always going down in value. And this isn’t by accident. Governments and central banks do it on purpose. Especially when there’s a financial crisis. Like the one in 2008, or the one this year, in 2020.At times like these, there’s a shortage of money. And governments try to get around it by just printing more. In fact, 22% of all dollars that exist today were created in 2020, when the Federal Reserve injected $2 trillion into the economy.Making money appear out of thin air, might sound pretty neat. Until you figure out the catch. There may be more money — but the amount of goods and services it’s chasing stays the same. And the value of money goes down compared with the value of those goods and services. And that’s what we call inflation.That’s why smart people trust gold more than money. Because when there’s an economic crisis, new gold doesn’t just magically appear out of nowhere. And it holds its value. And Bitcoin and other crypto — just like gold — don’t get created as a short-term fix to financial problems. That means it crypto also holds its value. And it’s inflation-proof.6It’s Way Easier to Get Into Crypto Than You ThoughtJust in case you thought you need a PhD in programming, or maybe in finance to get into crypto — we’ll tell you now. You don’t. A smartphone with internet access will do nicely. In fact, crypto is way easier to get into than more traditional investments.First, because it’s got high liquidity — that you can buy and sell it easily and quickly. Second, there isn’t a high threshold to getting into it. For stocks and bonds, usually you need to put a large sum of money, and you can’t just put down 100 bucks. With crypto, you can.Better still, there are no institutions, no paperwork — just get an account, get a wallet, track your assets. And it’s pseudonymous — you don’t have to give any documents, or even your name.But we realize, there’s still a lot of confusion, and not many people understand how this space works, and how to take advantage of it. That’s why we decided to create the best course out there, to guide you step by step through everything we’ve learned about Bitcoin and Blockchain — from scratch.It’s called Bitcoin Essentials. You’ll learn how the technology works, how to use it, how to buy bitcoin safely, and how to store it. Just to go7No One Controls Your MoneySo if regular money is controlled by governments and banks — who does control crypto? Well, the beauty of crypto is that it’s controlled by nobody — and everybody — at the same time.Let’s take Bitcoin. The code is stored in thousands of nodes — that means the computers of tens of thousands people who voluntarily run Bitcoin software on their computers. There’s no central authority or mastermind behind it. All users effectively retain control. And it’s in everyone’s interests to keep the network active and healthy.And running it this way has all kinds of advantages over banks. Like, banks are only open business hours of the country they’re based in. Blockchain functions non-stop. And banks payments can take up to 48 hours to clear — Bitcoin transactions take between 15 minutes and an hour.8The Best Security on the MarketSo, if there’s no big powerful institution monitoring it, is it safe? The answer is a definite yes. It’s got the best security out there. And that’s down to the way information is stored.Any time a transaction takes place, and digital money gets handed over to a new user, that gets recorded permanently. And it can’t be erased. Even after it’s changed hands again. And remember we said that the data is stored by tens of thousands users? Unlike a bank, which has one central database.If one user has an error — or if anyone tries to tamper with information — the other tens of thousands will cross-reference each other and correct it. And the bigger the network — the more secure. And in the case of Bitcoin — that’s big. And you can count on it being secure.9The Lowest Fees by FarFor any kind of investment you make, there are going to be fees. Fees for making buying, selling and even storing the investment. And this is also true of crypto. But the difference is that with crypto, fees that are determined by users. And that means it’s in their interest to keep them low. Much lower than the ones you’ll be charged by stockbrokers to invest in stocks or bonds.And the same goes for making transfers — especially international ones. Make a transfer through a bank, and you’re going to get slapped by a high fee. But with crypto, there are no institutions making a profit from these money transfers, which is a huge advantage for people doing business. And another reason why the adoption rate of crypto is going to keep going up.10Blockchain Is Here to StayWhat you have to understand about blockchain, is that Bitcoin and other crypto, are built on Blockchain in the same way Facebook or Google are built on top of the internet. It’s what makes crypto possible — but there’s more to blockchain than crypto.We think that crypto is proof enough that blockchain is going to become more important. But just in case you needed more — let’s just look at all the other things blockchain is being used for.Big business is using it to record data. Companies like Pfizer, Walmart, Siemens, Unilever use it to keep data which is too complex for a spreadsheet to record. Healthcare providers use it to store their patients’ medical records safely. And there’s potential for it to grow in records of property ownership. And in elections, to keep track of votes and take away the need for recounts. Yep, that one would have come in handy in 2020.11High Returns if Done RightWe’ve already told you how much Bitcoin’s gone up — and how the long-term trend is bound to continue upwards. So we won’t repeat ourselves. But we will take the chance to tell you about a few other cryptocurrencies.In 2020, even with the pandemic in full swing, lots of crypto have seen big gains. The world’s second largest crypto, Ethereum started the year at $145, and is now at $600. And some are tipping it to become as popular as Bitcoin.And Ripple started the year at just over 20 cents and is now around 65 cents. And may others are headed in the same direction. Further proof, that now’s the time to get in the door, if you haven’t already.12It’s in Limited Supply — and Can’t Suffer From InflationRemember we talked about the way conventional currencies lose their value because of inflation? There’s a simple reason why crypto doesn’t.The supply is capped. This is written into the source code, which states that there will only ever be 21 million bitcoin produced.Currently, 18.5 million Bitcoins have been mined. Quick explanation — mining means when advanced computers crack complex math problems and unlock the Bitcoins stored in the code.And even if new Bitcoins are still getting mined, there’s a limit on this. Unlike with traditional money, when banks decide print it by the truckload. With Bitcoin, the number of new coins released slows down every four years, meaning the supply is limited. And that’s the reason Bitcoin won’t suffer from inflation.13The Price Is Dictated by the Free Market, No Government Can Touch ItWith traditional money, governments have lots of options for manipulating its value. We already mentioned printing new money. As well as that, they set interest rates — the price of borrowing government money, which has ripple effect on the rest of the economy.But with crypto, none of this is set by a government. Instead everything’s controlled by the free market — or how much people are willing to buy or sell it for. And besides that, governments can’t freeze crypto accounts, or look at records of who has how much in crypto accounts. That’s because, unlike regular bank accounts, crypto accounts are pseudonymous. That means the holder doesn’t disclose their true name or identity.14It’s at an Early Stage and Already Disrupting MarketsSince Bitcoin was created in 2009, meaning that crypto’s already over 10 years old. But now’s the time it’s’ really taking off — and the growth it’s’ going to see over the next decades is likely to be a whole load more exciting than what we’ve seen up until now. You could say, the stage we’re at now is like the internet in the 90s.In fact, if you look at the numbers of people who’ve adopted cryptocurrencies over the last decade, it looks a lot like the adoption of the internet back in the 90s. Deutsche Bank have pointed out this similarity — and they predict that adoption rates are going to keep on at the same rate as the internet after the 90s. In other words, it’s going to keep on going up — in a spectacular way.And just like the internet’s disrupted literally everything over the last twenty years — we’re probably looking at blockchain doing the same over the coming decades.15Big Business Is Taking It SeriouslyLook at the list of companies that already accept payment in Bitcoin. Microsoft. AT&T. McDonalds, KFC and Subway. Virgin Galactic. CheapAir. Gyft. 4Chan. Norwegian Air. Twitch. Sports clubs like the Dallas Mavericks, Miami Dolphins or Portuguese soccer club Benfica. And Wikipedia accepts donations in Bitcoin.True, other companies are still reluctant to allow payments in it — because, it’s still volatile. But that’s bound to even out over time, and more and more big business will accept Bitcoin — and other crypto — as payment.And remember how we mentioned that Twitter’s Jack Dorsey’s talked about it being the future of money? Well, he’s put his money where his mouth is, and his payments company Square has invested $50 million in Bitcoin.",UNKNOWN,"L.

11,"No. It’s not clear to me that crypto will ever totally replace fiat currency. Did we get rid of gold? It seems far more likely that we’ll continue to have fiat currencies along with cryptocurrencies.Understanding how this new hybrid system works will prove important for future monetary policy and investment prospects.Let’s start with the advantages of fiat currency.1. Why Have Fiat At All?Fiat monNo. It’s not clear to me that crypto will ever totally replace fiat currency. Did we get rid of gold? It seems far more likely that we’ll continue to have fiat currencies along with cryptocurrencies.Understanding how this new hybrid system works will prove important for future monetary policy and investment prospects.Let’s start with the advantages of fiat currency.1. Why Have Fiat At All?Fiat money is really a system of exchange that is supported by a set of institutions that can employ coercive power. That’s its anchor in reality.At the end of the day, fiat power is backed up by bullets.* If you don’t pay your loans, they can take you to court and strip you of whatever possessions you have. If you don’t like that, just try out gunning law enforcement.So don’t buy into the BS that fiat currency has value because people believe it does. It has value because it’s part of a system of contracts enforceable at bullet point.A second advantage of fiat money—beyond having a clear anchor in reality—is that it devalues. That is a good thing (if it happens slowly).* People aren’t generally great at getting themselves out of debt. Inflation (through fiat devaluation) actually helps the debtor, not the creditor.Finally, fiat money can help a sovereign nation navigate its own debt burdens with respect to international creditors.* If a nation finds itself unable to pay its loans, it can always choose to devalue its currency through inflation (the rich never want to pay higher taxes and can usually lobby to avoid that).To my mind, those are three advantages to fiat money. I simply don’t understand how cryptocurrencies even try to solve these problems. That’s why I don’t think we’ll see fiat money disappear any time soon.2. The Future of CryptocurrenciesI’ve long distinguished platform coins, like Ethereum, from cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin. (Read this article for a walkthrough of the crypto space presently [ https://www.quora.com/Which-cryptocurrency-will-be-popular-at-the-end-of-2021/answer/L-Sebastian-Purcell-PhD ]).If you look at how decentralized finance works right now, it’s a hybrid system. Stable coins have far surpassed Bitcoin in exchange volume.Just have a look at TradingView’s heat map [ https://www.tradingview.com/heatmap/crypto/?color=change&dataset=Crypto&group=no_group&size=total_value_traded ].Bitcoin might be a store of value (and it is holding up better than almost everything else in the crypto world during this decline), but it’s not a medium of exchange.All the DeFi protocols that offer great returns are using stablecoins pegged to the US dollar—rather accidentally giving the US dollar additional use-value beyond its purposes as a fiat currency. Just look at Midas’ returns.In short, it’s not clear that we need more than one form of digital gold (Bitcoin). That digital gold receives value through decentralized support—which is why Jack Dorsey is right to focus on strengthening this system [ https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/14/22883500/jack-dorsey-block-bitcoin-mining-system-open-source-mainstream ].* If fiat (centralized) currency has bullet based value, then decentralized cryptocurrencies must have resilience base value.Ultimately, Bitcoin can help citizens hoping to preserve the value of their wealth against sovereign nations by moving it outside of them in times of crisis. But it can’t help those citizens with credit difficulties within those nations during more ordinar...",6 followers,Ryan Burner,735,0,0,2020,https://www.quora.com/Which-is-the-best-crypto-currency-to-buy-in-May-2019
