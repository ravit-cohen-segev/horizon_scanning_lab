3,"Here’s a different answer than the ones posted so far: Judaism itself.Judaism is a religion focused on education and on discourse. Jews are always asking questions, always challenging the learned authorities, always learning. For thousands of years, especially since the destruction of the 2nd Temple in Jerusalem in 70 CE and the advent of “rabbinic” Judaism, Jews have been taught from an early age to learn vigorously because it was the best way to create a thriving religion and culture, and was often the only way to survive in a place and time that hated Jews because they refused to conform.CoHere’s a different answer than the ones posted so far: Judaism itself.Judaism is a religion focused on education and on discourse.

Everyone receives a basic religious education in the principles of Islam and the Quran but education and discourse are not as highly valued as obedience. And challenging fundamental principles is strictly prohibited; in fact, Moslems risk being branded as apostates if they attempt do to so.This fundamental difference is one of the prime reasons why Israel is so successful compared to its Arab neighbors. Of course, there are other reasons as well:",813 followers,Boni Aditya,5.4K,408,1M,2017,https://www.quora.com/Is-Israel-a-developed-country

Schnorr Country.But was the money indispensable to Israel’s very survival? perhaps. But consider, that the 600,000 Jews in 1948 Palestine had no other choice, with or without donations; money isn’t the only thing that makes the world go round, but motivation counts as well. Some countries float on oil or other minerals, yet most of their population doesn’t see much from it, sadly. TheThere are lots of Jewish donors, of course. But one of the largest donations was billions of dollars in4. Economic PolicyIsraelis endure extortionate taxes for this “free”. A gallon of petrol costs $7 in Israel, nearly three times the average U.S. price, due to a 47% sales tax; 87% for buying a car. Banks in Israel are tightly regulated by the state, preventing collapses such as the real estate bubble in the U.S., or Bernie Madoff style scams.5. English6. Arguments.7. Open mindedness, order vs chaos.I often muse that uniform dress can be related to uniform thought. Lateness is less frowned upon in Israel than in Europe or the U.S.; Israeli culture doesn’t stress uniformity, obedience, exactitude, honor and respect to hierarchy as, for example, German, Indian, Japanese or American cultures do; in those countries, the notion that “everything has a proper place and time” is relatively strong. Israelis are a bit dispossessed in the order of things (as Jews were often dispossessed in the past). They can be outspoken, impolite and vulgar, and have less respect for western concepts of “personal space”; they don’t worry so much about what other people think of them or political correctness.Below: A passing Israeli soldier plays a public piano in a Tel Aviv train station.8. Improvised Country.During the Israeli war of independence in 1948, Israelis faced Arab tanks with homemade Molotov cocktail bombs and motley “Davidka” mortars, which made more noise than actual damage to the enemy. Such spirit seems to be alive and well today.

Russian Immigration.11. The Conflict.The Arabs usually commanded superior forces on paper (in numbers - planes, tanks, soldiers). Israelis needed to fight for survival in several major wars (1948, 1967, 1973), outnumbered, against coalitions of Arab countries. This reality pressured Israeli society to be creative, think outside the box, make do with less, and not despair quickly even when faced with serious challenges. The conflict with the Arabs has had a considerable molding influence on Israeli culture, for better and worse. Many Israeli hi-tech industries have been founded by veterans of Israeli army hi-technology units, and Israeli defence corporations such as ELTA and ELBIT compete with the best American, British and German products, in some industries (such as drones, cyber-warfare, guided missiles and anti-missile defence).12.While Israel was briefly supported by the Soviets initially (1947–1948), it later picked western allies and patrons: Germany, France, and ultimately (from 1973) the United States. Eventually, Egypt followed suit, switching patrons to the U.S., while signing an American brokered peace agreement with Israel in 1979. Israel made a peace treaty with Jordan in 1994; subsequently, the threat of Arab coalitions attacking Israel, seems considerably reduced.Capitalism has many shortcomings, but as the saying goes, it is the worst system…except for the others. Israel slowly evolved, from socialist beginnings (early Zionism) towards free market economics and high technology industries.American presidents come and go, but after 1973, the American defence establishment decided that Israel is important to them. After all, in Israel you can always dock an aircraft carrier for supplies or repairs, without having to check which dictator is ruling the country this week. The U.S. consequently supports Israel with an estimatedThat being said, Israel’s economy isn’t critically dependent on U.S. aid, but the close ties between the two countries are beneficial to Israel, and project a kinship of emphasis on technology, pursuing a qualitative edge in industry and the military. Enthusiasm and support for the U.S., politically and culturally, is typically high in Israel.Sources:http://www.oecd.org/education/Israel_EAG2013%20Country%20Note.pdf",722 followers,Jiangjunling,780,618,1.1M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Is-Israel-a-developed-country

However, foreign investment in India is quite different from that in China.Foreign investment in India is aimed at capturing the domestic demand of India,Foreign investment in China, the purpose is not only to occupy the Chinese market, but to meet the needs of the world!Foreign investment in India, more to meet the Indian government's market access requirements,It is easy to judge that Indian made products are not globally competitive and it is hard to see any Indian made products outside India.Second, India may miss out on a fourth industrial revolutionMany people call breakthroughs in high-speed communications, new energy, new materials, life sciences, artificial intelligence and other fields the fourth industrial revolution.But indians are still keen on IT and have invested little in the fourth industrial revolution.I am not saying India is not investing, but very little, less than one tenth of China.In the future, the level of science and technology will determine the strength of a country, or even the destiny of a country.Third, India's environmental crisisAs a Chinese, I have witnessed the destruction of China's environment by industrialization.It is easy to destroy the environment, but difficult to repair it. Today, the annual investment in environmental protection in China far exceeds the sum of education and military expenditure.But it will take generations to repair the environment, and some will never be.Unfortunately, I saw similar environmental damage in India, which has a higher population density and a lower environmental carrying capacity than China.India must solve its environmental problems, which may cause social instability and unrest.Fourth, India's education crisisIn particular, inequality in education,Personally, 20% of people in India get a good education, but the quality and environment of education for the other 80% is really bad.Inequality in education leads to inequality in life development,India should pay special attention to the quality of mass education and invest heavily in it.","46,128 followers",Steven Haddock,1.4K,25.6K,343.6M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Is-Israel-a-developed-country

The yellow lines are six lane express ways - Interstate high speed lines. Do you see how many highways exist in USA? USA is filled with yellow lines - These yellow lines are like high speed - 1GBPS optical fibers laid across the country i.e. I can take my huge truck full of cars from one corner of my country to the other without applying any brakes in full throttle and conduct my business. i.e. SELL;Now COMPARE USA with CANADA.In Canada - Unfortunately only three cities are well connected with Highways - Toronto - Ottawa - Montreal - Qubec city and Nova Scotia - The rest of he nation is a barren waste land - Yes people live there but - they are virtually disconnected - unless they are willing to fly!So is USA better than CANADA - Not Really - USA has a better climate than Canada - If Canada was not the SIBERIA of AMERICAS it would have been filled with mesh of express ways like USA.EUROPE VS RUSSIAThe tale repeats - The most concentration of expressways is in a few countriesNetherlands - Belgium Germany -Denmark - France - Have this tightly knit spider web of express ways - Check them outCHINA vs INDIANow let us take a look at china - They laid so many roads that it is filled with express ways - six lane roadsCompare that with IndiaIndia has only two express ways - For a country of Billion People(1) New Delhi - Agra - Lucknow - The Yamuna Express way - (Vishal Khanna - Thanks for the edit )-(2) Ahmedabad to Vadodara - Barely visible on this mapPAKISTAN - It has one huge expressway connecting - Islamabad - Lahore - Peshawar - Thank to CHINA.What is TRADE?(1) MANUFACTURING AND SERVICES - Development Products (R&D) or People (training)(2) LOGISTICS - The movement of Goods or People(3) SALES AND MARKETING - The art of Selling Goods or PeopleLet us take this simple definition - for practical purposes - There are tons of other factors involved in trade and development - like Imports - Exports - Comparative Advantage - Exchange Rates - Fiscal Policy - Monetary PolicyLet us ignore all of them for a moment - Let us consider internal trade of various countries.The hallmark of a developed country is the ease of trade - The ease of starting a business.If I do not have a place to sit - i.e. to set up shop - Where would I start Manufacturing or Training PeopleIn India - If I wish to set up a factory - I would not have any buildings - I would not find any free space - If I do find a free space - There would be tons of red tape before I can get approvals - If there is no infrastructure to begin with I would not be able to do anything. I visit the local government school and I find that the roof leaks when it rains - does not have a fan in hot summer - is not connected by roads - the roads that are laid - were laid ten years ago and are now filled with pot holes. LOGISTICS i.e. the art of moving goods - there are no roads - There are no air ports - there are no shipping ports. SALES and MARKETING - selling Indian Goods - is pain not just in the ass but all over! You will understand this because - every Indian Good falls short in quality - according to international standards - most of the Indian goods are discarded i.e. thrown away because they don’t fit the requirements set by the buyer. Corruption is not a problem - it never was - Businessmen would earn more profits to pay for the corrupt - but the problem is that the corrupt money is not being used for infrastructure - China is as corrupt as India!What is China Doing?China has many structural advantages compared to IndiaThey are communists - They will kill anyone who stands in the way of the state! They will not hesitate - They will not forgive - They will exterminate ruthlessly.The state is atheist not secular - The state only tolerates religion and culture - mind the word TOLERATES i.e. if the state at any point of time believes that the religion is against the state or any culture is against the state - It will exterminate the religion or the culture. The great cultural destruction during Mao’s era is a proof of the extremes to which Chinese would go!It is a very good thing - China had a clean slate - a fresh slate - a slate cleansed with blood of many people who died during the struggle. China got rid of all the superstitions along with their old culture. India on the other hand lives in these superstitions -China is a COPY PASTE MACHINE - of profit makingChina copies - it copies profit making machines - If a business model is working - they will copy it - They copied Iphone - not just the phone but the Istore - that is an incredible achievement - They copied KFC - They copied McDonalds i.e. in china there is a chain of McDonald stores - not owned by McDonald. They have a copy of facebook - they have a copy of uber - they have a copy of twitter - they have a copy of a copy of a copy i.e. there are other companies trying to make copies of the chinese copies.The entire chinese state understood - the necessity of development - and they are pushing for it at any cost. Most of the chinese cities are covered with smog - but chinese can’t afford to stop their development - They need to make goods - services and sell them to make profits - as long as they make profits they develop.The Chinese are done with roads within their countryThe Chinese are done with RailsThe Chinese are done with PORTS - All these are ports developed by ChinaThe Growth Engine of China owes a lot of its Exports and Export trade is done by ships - not by road or by rail. Globalization happened over Container Terminals, Ports and Oceans - Unfortunately most of Indian - Ports are unfit for Docking International Ships - Hilarious but True - Indians never invested in making their ports world class - Chinese are done with ports not only in their country but also internationally -The Chinese are NOT Done with AIRPORTS YETThe only comparable infrastructure of India with China is in terms of AIRPORTS - India can compete with China on air traffic.But this too will pass - With China building hundreds of airports - by 2020 they will induct more than 100 new airports - to tackle the extreme congestion and delays in air port travel across the nation.I WILL SUM IT UPIndia pales in comparison to China in International PatentsNOTHING CAN BE DONE WITHOUT INVESTMENT IN INFRASTRUCTURE - i.e. utilization of WEALTH to create more WEALTH - which starts a virtuous cycleEquivalent to investing the first twenty years of your life to education - China spent twenty years of its life from 1980 to 2000 in learning about developing profit making machines and investing in them - building cities - tows - roads - railways - and everything and anything in a mad rush to build - sell - repeat;make - sell - repeat; after millions of these selling cycles to international customers - The Country is now reaping the fruits of its investments made decades ago and pursued relentlessly.",UNKNOWN,Vivek (விவேக் பாலசுப்ரமணியன் ),650,126,591K,2017,https://www.quora.com/Is-Israel-a-developed-country

Chinese culture places a lot of importance on education. The focus on STEM fields is very pragmatic for which the government also sees as important. The best students work very hard to attend top universities in China and in the West. In these fields China has developed a lot of resources.Leiden University in the EU ranks universities for their research work in fields of science as well as science overall for their scientific impact. Their latest rankings….Three years ago, even China’s technological competitor and neighbour acknowledged its advancement.These things do not happen overnight. Over time, all of the above combined into creating China as a leader in certain scientific fields which combined with a work force that is prepared to work hard today for tomorrows benefit.",0 followers,Hadeed Ajmal Khan,1.6K,0,0,2020,https://www.quora.com/Is-Israel-a-developed-country
20,To understand this one needs to have a sound understanding of Supply Chain.All manufacturing giants shifted their manufacturing plant to China because of the low labour.All advanced techniques was taught to them which they learnt and started opening up their own companies.So tha manufacturing shift of the companies from US/Europe to China resulted in their advancement in technology.,0 followers,Luke Cillessen,3.2K,62,3.8M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Is-Israel-a-developed-country
21,"Steven Wu answered this question very well. Please allow me to add my two bits. China is many countries in one political unit. For example the city of Shanghai if viewed as a country is just as advance as Singapore, Sweden, most European countries. Yet China has quite a few cities similar to Shanghai, Guanzhou, Beijing, etc. while at the same time, some provinces are definitely not as advance. Even some Provinces like Guantong are well developed and may be comparable to Spain, Poland, and many other European countries with a comparable population.","2,537 followers",Carter Alston,11.8K,149,1.5M,2017,https://www.quora.com/Is-Israel-a-developed-country

The pricing and profit models for the platforms vary. Different platforms tackle concurrency in different ways. Some platforms are better for external integrations than others. Performance varies from one platform, language and architecture to another, and the performance criteria of your app specific to your app.Assuming the Android application is written in Java, then using Java on the server would allow you to share some code potentially which has some merits, as well as using the same skillset. Having said that, familiarity and code sharing are just two aspects of the wide array of tradeoffs you have to make.There's lots of specific choices listed by other commenters here, but ultimately you'll have to look at your needs, look at some of the options, and make a choice.",254 followers,Kenny Wyland,875,0,0,2014,https://www.quora.com/Is-Israel-a-developed-country

They just need to hire one or two men for their percentages to plummet. There's a lot of noise at the small company side of the spectrum.At scale, the numbers start to reflect the underlying lack of diversity in tech, and it is harder to maintain higher percentages. Only counting companies with 50+ total engineers, the percentage of female engineers in the sample drops from 12.7% to 10.5%. In this set of companies, the ones that have above-average representation of female engineers areNote: People quibble quite a bit about who is considered an engineer or developer. I've gotten some flak about not counting some types of technical work as engineering (e.g. sysadmin, CSS), but the line has to be drawn somewhere.
