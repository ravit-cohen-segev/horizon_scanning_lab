The difficulty of the puzzle (Network Difficulty) adjusts every 2016 blocks (~14 days) to ensure that on average one machine will solve the puzzle in a 10 minute period.Network difficulty is calculated by the amount of hashrate contributing to the Bitcoin network.What is Mining Hardware?Mining hardware is specialized computers, created solely for the purpose of mining bitcoins. The more powerful your hardware –and the more energy efficient– the more profitable it will be to mine bitcoins.MinerHash PowerPrice*95.0 TH/s$10k-12k110.0 TH/s$15k-17k*What is Hashrate?git Hashrate is a measure of a miner’s computational power.In other words, the more miners (and therefore computing power) mining bitcoin and hoping for a reward, the harder it becomes to solve the puzzle. It is a computational arms race, where the individuals or organizations with the most computing power (hashrate) will be able to mine the most bitcoin.The more computing power a machine has, the more solutions (and hence, block rewards) a miner is likely to find.In 2009, hashrate was initially measured in hash per second (H/s) - Due to the exponential growth of mining, H/s was soon commonly pre-fixed with the following SI units:KilohashKH/s (thousands of Hashes/second)MegahashMH/s (millions of Hashes/second)GigahashGH/s (billions of Hashes/second)TerahashTH/s (trillions of Hashes/second)PetahashPH/s (quadrillions of Hashes/second)To try and put this into perspective, let’s look at how much revenue 1 TH of power can earn mining bitcoin. As the global hashrate is usually growing the revenue per TH for each miner is usually falling, - and the revenue chart for 1 TH/s looks like this:Mining Revenue per TH/s Source: Coin Metrics from The Block Crypto DataWhen you consider how many TH/s there are in the entire Bitcoin network though, you get a true sense of the scale of the industry:85 Exahash = 85,000,000 TerahashIn February 2022, the daily global revenue for Bitcoin mining is around $41M.How do Bitcoin miners calculate their earnings?You’ve probably heard the scare stories aboutRegardless of whether the impact is overblown by the media, it’s a fact that the underlying cost of mining is the energy consumed. The revenue from mining has to outweigh those costs, plus the original investment into mining hardware, in order to be profitable.In February 2022, one Bitcoin mining machine (commonly known as an ASIC), like the Whatsminer M20S, generates around $12 in Bitcoin revenue every day depending on the price of bitcoin. If you compare this to the revenue of mining a different crypto currency, like Ethereum, which is mined with graphics cards, you can see that the revenue from Bitcoin mining is twice that of mining with the same amount of GPUs you could buy for one ASIC. Thirteen AMD RX graphics cards cost around the same as one Whatsminer M20s.ASICs vs GPU Cards Revenue Comparison by F2PoolWARNINGThis graph shows you the daily revenue of mining Bitcoin. It does not take into account the daily electricity costs of running a mining machine. Your baseline costs will be the difference between mining profitably or losing money. GPU mining for Ethereum is more efficient than mining Bitcoin with an ASIC machineYou can think of it as though the miners are a decentralized Paypal. Allowing all the transactions to be recorded accurately and making a bit of money for running the system.Bitcoin miners earn bitcoin by collecting something called the block reward plus the fees bitcoin users pay the miners for safely and securely recording their bitcoin transactions onto the blockchain.What is the Block Reward?Roughly every ten minutes a specific number of newly-minted bitcoin is awarded to the person with a mining machine that is quickest to discover the new block.Originally, in 2009, Satoshi Nakamoto set the mining reward at 50 BTC, as well as encoding the future reductions to the reward.The Bitcoin code is predetermined to halve this payout roughly every four years. It was reduced to 25 BTC in late-2012, and halved again to 12.5 BTC in the middle of 2016.You can keep track of the next Bitcoin halving on ourMost recently, in May 2020, the third Bitcoin halving reduced the block reward to 6.25 BTC.What about transaction fees?The second source of revenue for Bitcoin miners is theThis is the beauty of Bitcoin. Every transaction is recorded in an unchangeable blockchain that is copied to every mining machine.Bitcoin doesn’t rely on a central bank to keep records, it’s the miners themselves that keep the records, and they get to keep a share of the transaction fees as well.Taxes on Bitcoin Mining ProfitsOf course, while profiting on Bitcoin mining isn’t certain, paying taxes on your mining rewards is. Every miner needs to know the relevant tax laws for Bitcoin mining in their area, which is why it is so important to use aHere is a great guide on how that software works toHow do you know if you can profit from Bitcoin mining?First of all, Bitcoin mining has a lot of variables. This is whyOne of the most important variables for miners is the price of Bitcoin itself. If, like most people, you are paying for your mining hardware, and your electricity,- in dollars, then you will need to earn enough bitcoin from mining to cover your ongoing costs; and make back your original investment into the machine itself.Bitcoin price, naturally, impacts all miners. However, there are three factors that separate profitable miners from the rest: cheap electricity, low cost and efficient hardware and a good mining pool.1. Efficient HardwareSo far in this article I’ve used the Whatsminer M20S as an example of the kind of machine you will need to mine bitcoin. These days there areThe price of hardware varies from manufacturer to manufacturer and depends largely on how low the energy use is for the machine vs the amount of computing power it produces. The more computing power, the more bitcoin you will mine. The lower the energy consumption the lower your monthly costs.When choosing which machine to invest in, miners should think about the machine’s profitability and longevity.Profitability is determined by the machine’s price per TH, how many watts the machine uses per TH, and your hosting costs.Tore ThornasIf the hosting cost is low enough, it often makes sense to prioritize the ‘price per TH’ over ‘watts per TH’, as your lower operational expenses (OpEx) will make up for the loss in your machine’s efficiency - and vice versa if your hosting costs are high.The manufacturer with the lowest failure rate right now is MicroBT, who make the Whatsminer M20S and other Whatsminer models.Bitcoin Mining Hardware Turnoff PricesOne useful way to think about hardware is to consider what price BTC would have to fall to in order for the machines to stop being profitable. You want your machine to stay profitable for several years in order for you to earn more bitcoin from mining than you could have got by simply buying the cryptocurrency itself.The following table shows that the majority of the most modern machines could remain profitable at a bitcoin price between $5000 and $6000. Some machines could handle a drop below $5k, if they are being run with electricity that costs under $0.05 kWh.Hardware Turnoff Price - New Generation Machines by F2PoolUnfortunately most older machines are now no longer profitable even in China. The Bitmain S9 has been operational since 2016 and interestingly enough they are still being used in Venezuela and Iran where electricity is so cheap that it outweighs the risk of confiscation. There may, eventually, be more reputable sources of sub 2 cents electricity as the access to solar and wind improves in North America.For the individual miner, the only hope of competing with operations that have access to such cheap electricity is to send your machines to those farms themselves. Not many farms offer this as a service though.2. Cheap ElectricityElectricity pricesIn practical terms. Running a Whatsminer M20S for one month will cost around $110 a month if your electricity is $0.045 kWh in somewhere like China, Russia or Kazakhstan. You can see from the table below that you would make $45 a month in May 2020 with those electricity prices.Profitability with $0.045 kWh electricityHowever, with the typical home electricity price in the USA, of $0.12 kWh, you would be running the machines at a loss from the start and it would not make sense to mine under these conditions:Profitability with $0.12 kWh electricityThat said, there is increasing interest in the US among miners seeking to use up flare gas being wasted at oil well sites. If you can capture that energy, it is quite cheap.Still, if you are mining out of your home, you will definitely lose money.3. Reliable Mining PoolThese days, every miner needs to mine through aIf the Bitcoin Network Hashrate is 100 EH/s (100,000,000 TH/s), a WhatsMiner M20S ASIC miner with 68 TH/s, has approximately a 1 in 1,470,588 chance of mining a Bitcoin block. With one block per 10 mins they may have to wait 16 years to mine that one block.Thomas HellerThe oldest two pools are Slush Pool and F2Pool. F2Pool is one of the largest Bitcoin mining pools and it supports around 15% of the entire Bitcoin network.ARK Invest ResearchF2Pool’s payout method is called PPS+. PPS+ pools take the risk away from miners, as they pay out block rewards and transaction fees to miners regardless of whether the pool itself successfully mines each block. Typically, PPS+ pools pay the miners at the end of each day.This is how PPS+ pools calculate how much to pay out to miners in their pool. Here comes the science part…If the Bitcoin Network Hashrate is at 85 EH/s (85,000,000 TH/s), a WhatsMiner M20S ASIC miner with 68 TH/s, will earn around 0.000702 BTC per day before pool fees.0.000702 BTC is calculated by 68 (miner hashrate) ÷ 85,000,000 (network hashrate) × 144 (number of blocks per day) × 6.25 (block reward).Pool fees are normally 2.50–4.00%, so let’s use 2.50% for the example; the net mining revenue is therefore 0.00068445 BTC.If BTC is priced at $9,000, then this M20S has a daily revenue of $6.16.Choosing the right mining pool is very important, as you will receive your mined bitcoin sent from the pool payouts every day. It’s important to choose a pool that is reliable, transparent and offers the right suite of tools and services to help you optimize your mining operation.4. Fees When Selling BitcoinAn often overlooked facet of mining profitability is the fees one pays to sell the Bitcoin one mines. If you are a small time miner, you may have to sell your coins on a retail exchange likeKraken's trading fee structureHowever, if you are a professional miner like F2 or Bitmain, you likely have really advantageous deals with OTC desks to sell your coins at little to no fees - depending on the state of the market. Some miners are even paid above spot price for their coins. Either way, professional mining operations deal with Bitcoin at a large scale and so they have more leverage to get deals that are good for them, and this doesn’t just apply to electricity purchases.If you think you have what it takes be mine profitably, we suggest you make sure first by using ourOur Mining profitability calculator can tell you if you can mine profitably where you liveProfessionals vs AmateursIt’s common knowledge that it has become very difficult for individual miners to get access to the best machines and the cheapest electricity rates. Bitcoin farms that operate at scale use these advantages to maximize their returns.As the difficulty of mining bitcoin increases, and the price lags behind, it is becoming harder and harder for small miners to make a profit.Bitcoin Difficulty vs Price by F2PoolIt all comes down to scale and access to cheaper prices. When people enter the space, without prior relationships, they struggle to compete with established mining operations.Bitcoin mining is starting to resemble similar industries as more money flows in and people start to suit up. With increased leverage, margins are lower across the whole sector. Soon, large scale miners will be able to hedge their operations with financial tooling to lock in profits, whilst bringing in USD denominated investments like loans or for equity.Kristjan MikselssonAsCan you Mine direct to an exchange?If you have put in the effort to learn about mining, and you have found a location with low cost electricity for your machines, then you still need to consider where to store the bitcoin that you mine.It is possible to mine direct from the pool to anHere are our top picks for Bitcoin wallets:COMPARISONLedger Nano XLedger Nano STREZOR TIs CPU mining profitable?No, and in the case of Bitcoin, it almost never was.

Profiting on your own is highly unlikely.The situation may improve in the future onceIf small miners can re-enter the network, it greatly increases decentralization and supports the original intentions of Satoshi Nakamoto even further.","3,398 followers",Raymond Scottman,1.1K,0,0,2021,https://www.quora.com/Is-there-any-opportunity-in-mining-some-crypto-these-days

Why would they pay you more money than you’re paying them, when the amount of money you’re paying them doesn’t let them invest or otherwise improve their business? How does this make sense in the least?2:People on Quora often seem to be shilling some investment service that guarantees ‘twice your returns in seven days’. Do..you actually need explanation as to why this is a scam? This is literally the exact bullshit that the original Ponzi scheme was made of.If people knew how to do this—they wouldn’t need you. Imagine doubling your money every week. You would need to do this for like, two months, tops, and then you’d be done. You would have all the money you could pretty possibly want, why would you sit there running a business? Just sit there doubling your money. You could do this with a dollar and be good to go in…six months?3:So, yeah, ‘be your own bank’ has always been stupid, but this one I’ll forgive people for, because it’s clever—so hardware wallets, if any of you aren’t up on this, is basically how you store your Bitcoin if you’re not going to store it On An Air-Gapped Linux Computer With Epoxied Ports or whatever the hell is the ‘sane, rational way’ to store your magic internet money. Trezors. Nanos. Those things.Anyway, so if you buy from anyone other than the manufacturer, (and by the by, briefly pointing out we’re making Bitcoin less trustless by trusting the manufacturer not to rip you off THEMSELVES), common scams include sending you the twenty-five word list as the ‘preset word list’. This is a scam. It is designed to trick you into setting up a wallet with private keys already known to the reseller. They watch the blockchain (remember, public, transparent ledger) for you adding coins to that wallet, then use the private key they gave you to steal all of them.Boom. Done.4:okay, so if you’re going to do this..stupid Bitcoin trading thing, motherfucking sighPlease be incredibly careful about which exchange you leave your coins on. Coinbase and Gemini are among the least likely to exit scam, but boy howdy.Just go look up QuadrigaCX, and Cubits, and BTC-E/Wex, and Mt. Gox. Look. You’re TRUSTING A THIRD PARTY.

They could also decide to hard fork the entire stack and then you have to chose which one to join.Or somebody can crack the mining with better math, forcing aAny combination of a security breach and better technology could force a trusted settlement, by which point you might as well be using your Bank of America Visa card. All encrypted cyphers will eventually become easy to crack, given enough resources, time and motivation.There is also the issue of stickiness, which is hard to calculate when the transactions are distributed and encrypted.Lets say its US narco dollars going into the system. You buy Bitcoins. You buy a thousand laptops in Hong Kong and you ship them to Peru. You sell them in Peru. You pay your taxes on the profit on the trade, and you buy more Bitcoins. Then you buy more laptops. There is no consumer credit in South America, 80% of people don't even have a bank account. Bitcoin at this point becomes the de-facto currency of trade. Soon enough people start paying for their cable bill in fractional bitcoin. Then it becomes real money. Now you are paying for real things with your smartphone, and its back to HK to buy smartphones…Stickiness though also has a negative connotation in this context. Unless you are doing real transactions with Bitcoin, its hard to get out of the position. If you got $100k to launder, no problem. But what about a billion? Its the Buffett problem. Me and you can chase the arbitrage opportunities, Buffett needs to chase the Billion dollar deals. There are only so many ways you can clean cash. Which leaves you with a pile of Bitcoins, you cannot make a use case for. You used to be able to buy buildings in Spain but they shut that down, and the real estate bubble collapsed. The Germans and the French called in the loans overnight, the Greeks got sodomized, the Irish gotThe biggest problem is that Bitcoin money supply in no way matches real economy transactions. I don't know how you could increase or decrease the money supply. Its ultimately fixed. Unless you could make a case for the US Treasury buying and selling Bitcoins to control the money supply… Try running that past the NY Fed.There are of course more risks to consider. How about the Donald decides to stick it to his buddies in NY… yep he will set the Federal tax rate for manufacturing at 15%, and tax all capital gains at 60%. The speculators- I mean the bankers- start crying like little girls and theIts passed the House, the Senate votes on it tomorrow, and the Donald will sign the bill into law on Friday after a ceremony in the Rose Garden with theHow fast are you going to be able to cash out your gains? Will we see real dollars being traded for Bitcoins? Or will we see Bitcoins being traded for dollars? Don't know, because I don't know who owns 80% of the Bitcoins. If its US investors holding Bitcoin they might choose to cash out, pay the current capital gains rate, and then maybe re-enter. Or the money supply could be captive to foreign entities, they keep their cool through the oscillation, knowing full well that anybody that wants to escape the high tax regime for financial transactions will eventually decide to offshore their transactions and use Bitcoin to do so…Do we know who the participants are? Do you know who Satoshi is and how many Bitcoin he or she owns? That’s not just Bitcoin, try googling Vitalik Buterin or Jeffrey Wilcke or Dr Gavin Wood. Who are they? Do you know? If you do let me know I want in…We know how many T-Notes the Fed owns, and what the Bank of Japan’s dollar position is. I can look that up and price the risk. How do you price Bitcoins?As a factory owner in the early 2000 my trades paid 15% capital gains, my profits from semiconductor test and assembly paid 62%. The risk to all financial plays is that the current state of affairs is hard to maintainAnother unknown is that we operate within the confines of the calendar year. Because that is what the tax man demands of us. But product and technology cycles are multi year. Losses up front, profits on the back end. Sunk costs years 1–2, profit years 2–4.Which leads us to the biggest problem, namely that the tax jurisdiction is fixed, while large businesses are transnational. I run my supply chain out of HK, I invoice out of Ireland, and I like the Double Dutch Skip with a hop to the City of London. People in California say all the time “as an independent country we would be 4th largest…” That assumes Oracle, Google, Facebook and Apple invoice out of California and pay their taxes in California. They don't. Tesla is domiciled in Nevada for tax purposes. As a matter of fact none of the above pay any income taxes at all. Never have and never will. What’s Apple’s tax rate in Ireland? 2%. Do the math.Profit is cash in excess of expenditures necessary to innovate and produce next’s year’s productProfit is a figment of the imagination. Its a perversion perpetuated by tax collectors, and rancorous marxist economists that after two centuries still have not included the risk premium in their little formulas.So what currency are we going to use for transnational digital goods exchange?I vote for Swiss Francs. They are all business and I trust them because they never ratted me out… in Brooklyn that’s called havingOr it could be a digital currency, more or less traceable against a basket of sovereign taxable currencies.Maybe we will stop taxing revenue in excess of cost, and only tax consumer consumption. If you save or you take thoseIn which case a digital token in a digital economy makes perfect sense because you cannot escape consumption taxation in an internet based consumer economy driven by consumer credit. Every transaction is triple verifiable. Which is what the tax manTransnational supply chains? Who cares, they are not paying taxes today anyways. You want that $120k 911S? Pay 48k in taxes on it. The more the merrier.Is Bitcoin going to reach 100k? I doubt it.A digital medium of exchange to account for digital and physical product distribution and sale in the real economy will certainly make its way into the financial food chain. That might be a value added tax or a flat sales tax.Regardless, the unit and method of digital exchange will be something tax authority friendlyBy the time that happens traditional banks willThat’s my story and I am sticking to it.

In the past, anyone with a PC could profit from mining, such as in the early days of Bitcoin mining, with just a computer, but now you need expensive mining equipment to have a chance of making a profit. So what are the most profitable cryptocurrencies to mine in 2021?If you have millions of dollars to invest, bitcoin is the most profitableThe profitability of cryptocurrency mining is very nuanced and depends on various variables such as hardware, electricity costs and the type of cryptocurrency you want to mine.Bitcoin is by far the most profitable currency to mine, although in most cases it is not the most profitable if you are a solo miner. Bitcoin mining is extremely competitive, it requires specialized hardware with ASIC (Application Specific Integrated Circuit) chips, and it requires cheap electricity to maximize revenue.Bitcoin is primarily mined by large companies, investing millions of dollars in thousands of ASIC miners, cooling systems, and operating in countries/regions where electricity prices are competitive. At current bitcoin prices, miners are able to earn $14.13 million per day in block rewards.Besides Bitcoin, which cryptocurrency mining can bring you the most profit?Ether - The second most popular cryptocurrency is the most profitable coin for most home miners. Although miner manufacturers have developed more advantageous ASIC miners for ethereum mining, which makes GPU mining less profitable, ethereum still supports GPU mining. ProgPOW is a mining algorithm change that aims to restore the resistance of ETH mining to ASIC miners, though it is unlikely that ProgPoW will get implemented at this point. After Ether switches to PoS (dropping PoW mining), these miners in Ether can also be used to mine other coins that use the ETHASH mining algorithm.Ether Classic (ETC) - This is another ETHASH cryptocurrency that is profitable for home miners using GPU mining equipment. With the release of Ether 2.0, the original Ether miners are expected to move directly to ETC mining, and ETC arithmetic is expected to climb significantly.","105,675 followers",Dave Consiglio,1.5K,6.8K,91.6M,1997,https://www.quora.com/Is-there-any-opportunity-in-mining-some-crypto-these-days
15,"News about crypto and blockchain is everywhere these days. A question I’m commonly asked by my friends is “In particular, I’ve focused on solving problems with our current money system that are uniquely possible with cryptocurrencies. I hope you’ll like and learn.1. Inflation (aka Currency Debasement)News about crypto and blockchain is everywhere these days. A question I’m commonly asked by my friends is “In particular, I’ve focused on solving problems with our current money system that are uniquely possible with cryptocurrencies. I hope you’ll like and learn.1. Inflation (aka Currency Debasement)In many ways, inflation is a hidden form of taxation, used to fund political promises. If it’s possible to print more money, the currency supply will continue to be inflated.Unlike fiat currencies, cryptocurrencies offer the ability to have a fixed creation schedule, and a hard capped maximum supply. Two top cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin and Decred, have a max supply cap at 21 million. A currency with a fixed supply that can’t be diluted is a breakthrough innovation that is simply not possible with fiat currencies.Scarcity drives value. Gold has retained its place as a store of value for 5,000 years, in part due to perceived scarcity. Yet there is no greater assurance of scarcity than a mathematically capped supply, which has now been made possible with cryptocurrencies.2. Foreign Exchange FeesImagine if every retail store had its own currency, and in order to use the currency in the store next door, you had to forfeit 30% of the value. At a macro level, this is analogous to what happens with fiat currencies. There are 180 currencies recognized by the United Nations, and these people owning different currencies are dis-incentivized from transacting with each other. Foreign Exchange fees are possibly the most unnecessary surcharges on people transacting with each other, and were unavoidable — until now.Central bank issued currencies are artificially constrained by geographical borders. If you’ve ever traveled to another country, you’ve likely returned with spare change which is essentially unusable. Cryptocurrencies on the other hand, are border-less by nature. The next time you are charged foreign exchange fees or find yourself with worthless foreign spare change, remember that there is a better alternative now available to us.3. Inefficient transfer of paymentsFiat money is inefficient to move around. As a result, we have to rely on various intermediaries, who each take a share of profits in order to relay money to the next recipient. Working in financial services, I’ve observed up close how inefficient today’s correspondent banking system is. If you’ve sent a wire transfer to another country, it may take up to five days (!) for the recipient to be able to access the money. These high fees and long settlement times are justified to us by saying these intermediaries are the trusted guardians of the walled money system.Unlike fiat currency, which requires middle men to move around, digital currencies have a built in payment and settlement network. You can directly send hundreds of millions of dollars to someone across the world using Bitcoin in a matter of minutes, for the price of a coffee. This kind of difference is basically insurmountable for fiat currencies, although companies like JP Morgan and Ripple are developing blockchain based payment solutions for institutional clients.4. Limited divisibility and incompatibility with micropayments (future use case)What’s the smallest unit of a dollar? Under the current paper and coin based money, the answer would be $0.01, even though mathematically the number can be smaller. These are artificial constraints, because technically we should be able to transact in half cents, a tenth of a cent, or even a smaller fraction.Unlike fiat currencies, a bitcoin can be divided into one hundred million units (0.00000001 BTC, also known as a Sat). The use for micropayments is not obvious today, but there are burgeoning signs with IoT where smart machines will transact with each other. As an increasing number of smart devices are connected to the internet, there will be opportunities to monetize microevents. Imagine a world with autonomous vehicles where you could put a price on each car that bypasses each other. These and other high frequency fractional transactions can be unlocked by better payment facilitation through cryptocurrencies.Another use case for micropayments is virtual goods and video games, for which there is massive opportunity in the gaming space. Imagine playing your favourite video game, where you can spend one tenth of a cent to level up to a special character trait. Interested in more Candy Crush lives and add-ons?5. Threat of Confiscation and privacy of asset ownershipFor many parts of the world, the threat of your savings being seized is a real concern. Most of the world population (4 billion people) still lives under autocratic rule where property can be confiscated. This isn’t just a problem for citizen’s fleeing war torn countries. Even authoritarian leaders themselves can have their bank accounts and Gold holdings seized by others.For the wealthy, this has given rise to the offshore banking industry, which is worth over $30 trillion dollars. Most of the world does not have access to the offshore banking industry today, and you can argue that the real global value of an unseizable store of value should actually be higher. Cryptocurrencies offer a non-sovereign censorship resistant store of value that is impossible with fiat currencies.6. Financially including the globally unbankedWhile we take access to bank accounts for granted, over 2 billion around the world still don’t have a bank account. Infrastructure and paperwork requirements prevent large number of people from participating in global commerce.An example of the profound opportunity for banking the unbanked is the case of girls in Afghanistan who use their phones to get paid in bitcoin, without having to ask for male colleagues to accompany them to the bank for safety. Cryptocurrencies offer a reduced way to store and move value that is free of guardians that has never been possible before.ConclusionMost people first get interested in crypto because it can make you rich. I’ve deliberately stayed away from any price discussion or predictions, because price is a function of demand, and demand is generated and sustained by value. And cryptocurrencies offer value propositions today that are impossible to compete with.",18 followers,Asim Qureshi,1.4K,996,156.1M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Is-there-any-opportunity-in-mining-some-crypto-these-days

The blockchain is the true invention and it practically solves a group of problems that have traditionally been insolvable: TheIt’s all about trust. In a normal financial system you have to trust your bank. If your bank is malicious you can be taken advantage of without your knowledge or control. If your central bank or state is malicious you will be taken advantage of.Cryptocurrencies on the other hand are trustless systems. Your money aren’t in an account because the banks computer says so, your money are in your account because it’s impossible for anyone to move them who don’t have the key. If you move money it isn’t a value changed in a bank or payment processors database it’s put on the public blockchain and secured with a lot of math.The math takes effort to generate. Those who generate the math are miners and they get paid for their trouble by also generating new money whenever they manage to make a block. In order to fake a transaction or to rollback a transaction a malicious actor would have to out-math the entire network. This is expensive enough that it just would not be worth it or perhaps even be possible.Cryptocurrencies and other blockchain implementation solves the problem of having a public ledger that any actor can access and use but no actor can falsify or roll-back. It solves trustless trust. That is the value that cryptos have.The actual valuation of a cryptocurrency is of course subject to the same mechanics that all other currencies and commodities face. Bubbles, manipulations and cash-grabs are common. But the base value of a single blockchain is the amount of math-power that its mining network has. This is a real physical value similar to gold or oil.",16 followers,Ara Mambreyan,7K,397,18.3M,2017,https://www.quora.com/Is-there-any-opportunity-in-mining-some-crypto-these-days
