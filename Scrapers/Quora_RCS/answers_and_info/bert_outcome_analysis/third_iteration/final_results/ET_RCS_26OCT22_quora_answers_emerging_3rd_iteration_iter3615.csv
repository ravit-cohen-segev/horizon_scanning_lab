In innovation? Yes The Global Competitiveness Report of 2016 to 2017 ranked Israel as having the world's second most innovative economy on the globe. In solar energy? Yes[1]. In cyber? Yes. In medecine? In medical research Israel is by far better than both and it is best in the world per capita[2]. In practical medcine Israel is about the same as Japan and better than Germany. For example in all major cancers survival ranking rates Israel is placed far higher than Germany and usually in top 3 or 5 in the world. In male life expectancy Israel is ranked higher than both, if you factor out war related deaths and terroist attacks Israel takes the first place in the world with ease [3]. In air force[4] and intelligence? Yes . I would argue that israel is even more advanced than the USA in Cyber and intelligence[5]. It's just that Israel does much more classified work which is desperately kept discreet. Israel is more advanced than both in agriculture and farming related science and inventions. Israel is more advanced than both in terms of patents and creative scientific publications per capita. Israel has more academic educated people than both of them per capita. In the modern era Israel has put out more world first-class mathematicians, computer scientists, musicians and chess players than both[6] . Israel has many top class computer scientists and is a superpower in computer science [7]. Israel has won more Turing awards for computer science than both of them combined not even per capita ( per capita Israel is no. 1 in the world). The list goes on and on. The problem is that mostly these things are not so prominent to the average people because they are just good on measures of ‘per capita ‘ and ‘average ‘. But the fact that these countries are at least ten times Israel’s size confuse us and make them in some sense more prominent . For example, there are more academic degree holders in Israel per capita than in Germany , but there are probably more degree holders in Germany in terms of absolute numbers than Israel so eventually it should make Germany stronger and more advanced but only due to the bulk got me??? Israel is almost the best in academic publications , inventions and stuff. And Israel has the highest number of scientists and technicians per capita in the whole world, but it is also very very very VERY small which lets other countries catch up with it in absolute numbers.Now imagine how would Israel have looked like if it was 10 times bigger (80000000 ppl) ? Scarry , isn't it? Too strong to compete with.[1] From Wikipedia “Israeli engineers have been at the cutting edge of solar energy technology” it doesn't specify what it means. But it does provide a hint that Israel was a pioneer in solar energy since 1950. And Wikipedia states that “Israel is now the world leader in the use of solar energy per capita”[2] From Wikipedia “Israel is a world leader in medical and paramedical research, and bioengineering capabilities. Biotechnology, medical, and clinical research account for over half of Israel's scientific publications, and the industrial sector uses this extensive knowledge to develop new pharmaceuticals, medical equipment, and treatment therapies.[67] Among other areas of medicine, Israel is a leader in stem cell research, with the largest number of articles, patents and research studies per capita,[68] as well as research into regenerative medicine and medical marijuana.”[3] Israel is ranked no. 2 in the world for male life expectancy.

Actually she doesn’t sleep very well, so she often watches TV into the night. Last year she had dozed off one night and woke to find an intruder in the room. She asked him what he was doing, got a rather incoherent reply then asked him to leave. She heard him heading towards the front door, but she didn’t hear it closing. (It has a slightly stiff lock, so you have to give it a bit of a bang to close it properly). Well, so she finished watching the TV program (of course), and then got herself out of bed to check. The door was closed, but the door to another room was slightly ajar…Peering in, she saw the spare cash that is kept in full view on the sideboard for use by her carers was untouched. Also, there, asleep on the settee was the young man.At this point she says (as if what had happened so far was straight forward), she was not sure what to do. Should she wake him or not? At last it occurred to her to ring the police for advice. They were there in minutes. They didn’t use siren’s so as not to wake the neighbours, they certainly didn’t use guns and they didn’t jump on the man and aggressively manhandle him to the car. One of them woke him gently and sat down for a chat with him while the other helped my friend back to bed. With her agreement, they decided not to arrest him immediately but to give him a lift home and decide what to do in the morning.In the end, a deal was struck whereby he pay for the damage done to the porch window (which he had broken to gain entry), and they wouldn’t charge him. The window was replaced (with reinforced glass) and a letter of thanks and apologies came two days later enclosing the requisite cash. That was the end of the matter.All a bit namby pamby for you? Maybe, but honestly, at 92 you don’t want all the rigmarole of lengthy witness statements, possible court appearances, dealing with insurance claims and so on. You certainly don’t want a man with gunshot wounds keeling over leaving blood stains on the carpet and causing an obstruction as you struggle to get past him with your walking frame.",3 followers,Maxime Munger,18.8K,197,1.1M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Is-covid-being-used-to-push-us-into-a-more-advanced-technological-world

Technology innovation is based on the flow of ideas. And Trump has absolutely zero understand of how the system works. His protectionist ideas are scaring people away and alienating our trade partners.Let me be more specific. Why was Silicon Valley, a small geographic area in the US West coast, the birthplace of so many interesting technologies? Because it attracts the best talent in the world, and therefore the best ideas and the best resources to cultivate those ideas.if you want to be an actor, yo go to Hollywood. If you want to be a technologist, you go to the Silicon Valley.With the recent travel ban, changes to the H1-B program, general anti-immigrant sentiment, and overall bullying and protectionist philosophy of Trump’s presidency, two things are happening:1. Companies are investing outside the U.S.Most software companies today are global. It’s not uncommon to see a small software company (under 100 employees) have operations in two or three continents. Senior managers at those companies understand that if they place software development jobs in the US, they will be harder to fill because there is less talent coming in, plus there uncertainty about the ability to keep current employees. The sensible decision, as of today, is to shift development resources outside the U.S.Don’t believe this? read up on the growth of Silicon Valley alternatives in Bangalore, Singapore, Guadalajara, Cambridge, Israel, Belarus and London. Software has no nationality. There are good developers everywhere.All this started when the government put an (irrational) limit on much needed H1-B visas and it refused to grow the program as the talent needs of technology companies grew.I was working at Microsoft at the time, and remember Bill Gates pleading with the senate. After they gave Bill their negative answer, I saw how Microsoft started growing their development centers globally.Today, there are many companies who have no developers in the U.S. It’s not lack of patriotism, it simply that is is almost impossible to find talent here. Talk to a few software development recruiters to make your own judgment.It’s crazy. At O’Reily Velocity 2016, a software event, the largest exhibitors were not companies showing their latest technology innovations, but employers like SalesForce, who invested half a million dollars in their presence at this event simply to recruit any available talent.The same is happening with incubators, VCs and some of the other resources that are needed to foster innovation.Under this circumstances, Trump’s position might be enough to tip the scales and cause a small number of of Silicon Valley alternatives around the World to gain the momentum and critical mass to en Silicon Valley’s absolute leadership.2. Talent is no longer coming to the U.S.We see it on the news, I hear it from friends and family: immigrants with permanent residence status who are not allowed to enter the U.S. Tourists who get their privacy violated as border agents review their personal messages on their cell phones. University professors that are not allowed to enter the country to lecture students because it is considered ‘work’. Tourists that are not allowed into the country.Unfortunately, I hear it every day from people all over the world. Many are scared toIn the last week, there were two incidents where a supremacist has approached an immigrant, said ‘get out of my country’ and shot them. This is clearly encouraged by Trump’s rhetoric and reinforced through his policies. Unfortunately, the Indian software engineer, who worked at Garmin, died.The U.S. has become hostile to immigrants, talented or not.Can you imagine if the U.S. had been this way for the past 150 years? Imagine if Nikola Tesla had stayed in Europe, if Albert Einstein had stayed in Germany, if Steve Jobs’ dad had stayed in Syria, if Andrew Grove had stayed in India, if Elon Musk had stayed in Australia.These are the people that gave us electricity, nuclear power (and the bomb), Apple, Intel semiconductors, electric cars and Space-X.Without these 5 people, the U.S. would be a very different place today. And that’s only the tip of the iceberg.

Who would have predicted that the most expensive way of making a phone call would be so critical to the developing world? It would be like saying, there are few cars in Africa today (relative to the population) so people will instead choose to fly where they have to go including to work, etc.Personally, I think there are some interesting things on the horizon. Still, I think that we have not managed to deploy existing technology well. I have yet to see a company deploy mobile technologies well. I would be happy if someone just turned a paper form into an app but often the end result is worse.I think that the “basics” will be back and with a vengeance. For example, food/basic farming. The production of meat will have to change. We do not have the ability to generate enough meat to feed the world. For plant based food, I think that we will see Vertical/container farming.We will see aquaculture take off but the best countries are pretty far behind. Aquaculture right now consists of fish farming but that is a negative output. We create fish meal which is mostly made of up meat turned into a pellet and feed that to fish that we eat. Each time you go up a level, you loose about 9/10 of the total energy. So if you take 100 calories of plants and feed that to an animal you end up consuming about 10 calories. Ideally what you want to do is to have an animal that is tasty and eats something that you can’t eat or does not compete as much with what you eat. Its better if its a complement. So, in the case of wheat, you have the plant, seed portion that we eat but the rest can be eaten by cattle (for example.) We can then eat the cattle. If we ate Tigers then this would be a pretty bad calculation, because we would need 1000 plant calories to feed a cow, to get 100 calories to feed a tiger to get 10 calories.The other thing to consider is that fish like Salmon etc do not start out with the vitamins that they contain. They consume them from their environment. We will likely see underwater farming at some point soon enough and this will supplement vertical/container farming. What is holding back this alternative agriculture are archaic rules. For example, people want it to be of a higher standard than normal conventional farming. I think that because it has a lower footprint/resources/pesticide consumption it should be good enough.I know we have felt that outer space etc will be the next frontier but we still do not have a reason to go there. Sending out an exploratory fleet is expensive. Four hundred years ago, a shipment of cinnamon could set you up for life, these days you could easily buy that much cinnamon for much less. Four hundred hears ago it would take a ship, a full crew and a few years. Today, the expenditure/effort is much less.I think that we have seen communication technology come close to peaking, we will see improvements but I do not think it will be as disruptive as the past 30 years. I think that we will see a movement towards a fractured internet, the West, China/Russia and perhaps some others. We have seen this to some extent.I think that we will also see a movement away from technical skills. Programming is turning into a game and that will have issues because, … I think that IOT will exist but it will have a lot of holes and we will have a WWI/WWII situation as a result. We do not know what our weakest links are in our connected world and we may need to break down and segregate things for safety.","1,594 followers",Michael Van In,632,1.5K,2.9M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Is-covid-being-used-to-push-us-into-a-more-advanced-technological-world
