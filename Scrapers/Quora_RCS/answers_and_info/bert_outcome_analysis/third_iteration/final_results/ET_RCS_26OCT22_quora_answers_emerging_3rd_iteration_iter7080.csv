It's hard to imagine nowadays, but that was before MySQL was widely used. Instead, things were built on mSQL (which wasn't very good), BerkleyDB  or expensive commercial products if databases were used at all. Because of the cost and having to write so much from scratch all kinds of substitutes were common. One of the bigger local sites, a kind of prehistoric social media site, was built using NNTP server as the content database. Using file system instead of a database was also not unheard of.The tool of choice for most developers was Perl, running it as CGI scripts. There wasn't any real alternatives, and it wasn't any kind of fancy Perl we've now. It was Perl 4, the Camel Book was at first edition and just 400 pages. Of course Perl 5 had been out for a while, but it took a couple of years to become popular.Back then, version control (CVS was state-of-the-art) was almost totally unheard of for many, and often vehemently opposed. Typically production code was modified on the production server, on the fly. Proper testing was extremely rare. And because there was just a handful of users, even on the most popular sites, there wasn't too many performance issues.In late '90s, things started to change. Developers' skill sets started to diverge - the guys who wrote the actual backend code would no longer think about pushing pixels into right places, and writing HTML and making things look right became a specialty. Advertising agencies started showing up and demanding fancy things that couldn't be done. The ""web color"" palette started to feel too limiting. The most common file on the web sites was transparent 1x1 pixel gif, because everything was built around that little bugger and endless amount of tables.But things also changed in other ways. PHP started to show up here and there, and it was one of the biggest reasons why some developers could focus on creating nice HTML to match the Photoshopped layouts, instead of hunting for the right print statements from a thousands of lines of code. MySQL became overnight success, the LAMP stack was born.Some bigger companies had also noticed the business opportunities. In the enterprise market IBM released WebSphere, and there were countless of others enterprise ""solutions"" you could spend half a million on, and end up with a product that was so heavy to run it would've cost another half a mil to buy a server that could handle it. I ended up working briefly with couple of these, and I ran away as fast as I could.There was a year, maybe two, when Java applets were the most fashionable thing. Those were probably the closest thing to current-day web apps as there really wasn't any other way to build proper interaction and server connections without causing page loads. Server-side Java took a little bit longer to become popular, as the tools weren't there at first.",107 followers,Carlos Esteban Lopez Jaramillo,554,128,318.7K,2013,https://www.quora.com/What-technologies-were-used-in-developing-web-applications-in-the-90s

Brahmos was developed by Russia’sBrahMos is developed 90% indigenously by India. Only the engine of BrahMos comes from Russia, whereas the control systems, sensors, seeker are used from indigenously manufactured.BrahMos has already been inducted with the Indian Navy and Army. BrahMos has an aircraft launched version that is being inducted. Similarly, a submarine-launched version is under trials. A new version of air-launched BrahMos is underway called BrahMos NG. It has the same range of 300 km, but with a speed of Mach 3.5 and half the weight and length. It can be launched even from smaller aircraft like MiG-29K/UPG, Mirage 2000, Rafale, Tejas, Jaguar. BrahMos NG will also be used to arm the AMCA, FGFA fighters.The BrahMos II is developed with two versions. The first version will have a speed of Mach 4 and will be developed within 4 years and the second version will be a hypersonic version with a speed of Mach 7. The BrahMos Missile tops the list of Indian defense products by India.Phillippines is the first foreign nation to buy and induct BrahMos in their armed forces. Vietnam, too, has plans to buy the BrahMos missile.Light Combat Helicopter:LCH is a light multirole combat helicopter developed by HAL. It is the only combat helicopter in the world that can operate at 6500 meters above sea level, making it most capable of high altitude warfare in theatres like Kashmir, Arunachal Pradesh, and Siachen. LCH is also capable of anti-tank warfare, stand-off range airstrikes, and providing close air support to ground troops in the environment ranging from cold high altitude Himalayas to low altitude hot Thar desert. LCH is a twin-seat helicopter with integrated stealth features along with the helmet-mounted pointing system, armor protected smart glass cockpit. IAF and the army have ordered 65 and 114 helicopters from HAL. HAL started the production of LCH in August 2017.LCA Tejas:Tejas MK1 is a single-engine light multirole fighter developed by HAL and ADA. Tejas was developed under the LCA program to replace the MiG-21 and MiG-27 fighters and is India’s 2nd indigenously developed fighter after HAL Marut. Tejas is highly maneuverable and has a small RCS, which gives it some stealth capabilities. Tejas has highly sophisticated avionics, fly-by-wire controls, fire control system, radar, helmet-mounted display. Two squadrons of Tejas are stationed at Sulur Air Force base. Similarly revamped naval version of Tejas MK1 is under trials.Hawk-i Combat aircraft:The Hawk-i is an upgraded armed version of the BAE Hawk trainer aircraft. HAL is building Hawk aircraft under license from BAE. HAL has upgraded the basic Hawk trainer into a combat aircraft with indigenously developed avionics and fire control systems. Hawk-i has high maneuverability as it a light combat aircraft. Hawk-i will have highly precise ground attack and electronic warfare capabilities. It will have to carry relatively less payload but will be excellent for aerial guerrilla attacks on enemy convoys, factories, fuel dumps, etc. It will also have high serviceability as all the maintenance will be done at HAL itself. It the first time HAL has developed an aircraft without the requirement from armed forces. The aircraft will be put on sale for potential buyers. The IAF should induct the Hawk-i to boost its squadron strength.INS VikrantINS Vikrant is India’s first indigenously built aircraft carrier. It is being built by Cochin Shipyard in Kerala. The aircraft carrier is expected to be commissioned by 2023.INS Vikrant is a conventionally powered aircraft carrier featuring STOBAR configuration and a ski-jump. It can carry up to 26 fighters along with ASW and AEWS helicopters. It expected to carry MiG-29K and naval Tejas or fighters which are procured through the MRCBF program. It will also have Ka-31 (for AEWS), Sea King (for ASW) along with HAL Dhruv. Almost 1700 sailors and officers will serve on the INS Vikrant.INS Vikrant will have Selex RAN-40L long-range AESA radar for tracking air targets and threats up to 400 km. It will also house the EL/M-2248 MF-STAR AESA radar used by ships to track low RCS air targets up to 250 km.Astra BVRAAMAstra is a beyond visual range air to air missile (BVRAAM) developed by DRDO. Astra MK1 has a range of 110 km for head-on chase while it is 20 km for tail chase mode. It can attain a speed of Mach 4.7 at an altitude of 20 km and will be used to arm the IAF and Navy’s fighters like Su-30MKI, MiG-29s, Mirage 2000, Tejas, Jaguar, AMCA, FGFA, Rafale.Astra was developed as an alternative to the Russian R-77 missile, which is expensive compared to the Astra. Astra missile’s capability is similar to Russia’s R-77 and USA’s AIM-120 missiles.Almost all the trials of Astra MK1 has been completed with the recent one in August 2017 and is going to be inducted by early 2018. Astra MK2 is being developed with a range of 160 km.Akash SAM:Akash is a medium-range Surface to air (SAM) missile system co-developed by DRDO, BEL, Bharat Dynamics Limited (BDL), and Ordnance Factory Board. It can engage aerial targets at a range of 30km at 18km altitude at Mach 2.5 speed. It can provide aerial protection up to 2000 sq. km area. The Akash system can track 64 targets simultaneously and engage 12 of them.Akash MK1 was inducted by IAF in 2012 and by the Indian Army in 2015. Akash MK2 is being developed with a higher interception range. Nations like Vietnam, Thailand, Malaysia are interested in the Akash SAM system.KALIKALI or Kilo Ampere Linear Injector is a linear electron accelerator developed by DRDO and BARC. KALI emits powerful rays of electrons which can burn down electronic circuitry in the target. It can be mainly used to target incoming missiles, so that the internal circuit of the missile will get affected due to high energy electron beam, and will cause it to explode mid-air before reaching the target.KALI is currently used only for research and testing the vulnerability of other defense equipment to such electron injectors. KALI is under development to be weaponized.INS ArihantINS Arihant is a nuclear powered ballistic missile submarine built by Navy Shipbuilding Centre at Vishakapatnam. It is the first of the indigenously designed and built nuclear-powered submarine of the Arihant class submarines. INS Arihant has four launch tubes and can carry up to 12 K-15 Sagarika missiles with one warhead each, with a range of 750 km or 4 K-4 missiles, with a range of 3500 km. Since INS Arihant is nuclear powered, it needs to be refueled only once in about 15–20 years. So the range of INS Arihant is not limited by fuel, but by food supplies. It can stay at sea for a duration of at least 5 months at a stretch.INS Arihant was commissioned in August 2016 and INS Aridhaman is expected to be commissioned in late 2018.Some other indigenously developed weapons by India areEdit 1:Please feel free to add and suggest any edits to the answer.",UNKNOWN,Nikhil,2.3K,748,2.4M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-technologies-were-used-in-developing-web-applications-in-the-90s

The first of them crosses over; suddenly the others realise it indeed was too good to be true. Two six-wheel rovers — a rover is a small vehicle that can be used over rough terrain — armed and ready with weapons are aimed at them. Hovering over them are drones, watching their every move. It’s game over for the intruders!Seems like a scene playing out from a movie or a video game, right? Well, soon this might be a reality, thanks to Delhi-based startup Cron Systems, which is developing a perimeter security system for protecting India’s borders.“What we do is automate perimeter security. We create a barrier so when anyone comes through, we get to know there’s been an intrusion and the system responds accordingly” — Tushar Chhabra, CEO and cofounder, Cron Systems“What we do is automate perimeter security. We create a barrier so when anyone comes through, we get to know there’s been an intrusion and the system responds accordingly,” says Tushar Chhabra, CEO and cofounder of Cron Systems.The company was founded in 2015 by Chhabra, Saurav Agarwala, and Tommy Katzenellenbogen, who also served as a fighter pilot in the Israeli Air Force. It counts the Border Security Force (BSF) and the Indian Army among its clients.On the fenceIndia has a land border of over 15,106km running through 92 districts and across 17 states bordering Bangladesh, China, Pakistan, Nepal, Myanmar, Bhutan and Afghanistan. The 3,323-km stretch that India shares with Pakistan is one of the most sensitive sections, with frequent intrusions. Fencing the entire stretch has been a challenge due to the difficult terrain and weather conditions.Kavach, developed by Cron Systems, is a laser and infrared-based fencing system that is weatherproof and can be implemented in all kinds of terrain.Kavach comprises poles fitted with lasers and infrared-based sensors to detect any intrusions between them. The poles are placed 200m apart. Image: Cron SystemsThe system comprises poles that are placed 200m apart — five poles for a 1km stretch. There are differently designed poles for curves and bends. The poles are fitted with lasers and infrared-based sensors to detect any intrusions between them.Once an intrusion is detected, a message is immediately sent to the base console unit, called the QRT (quick response tool). The soldier at the base is then presented with two options on the device display — ‘Secure’ or ‘SOS’. ‘Secure’ is to be selected if the soldier verifies the incident as a false positive. The ‘SOS’ option alerts the command base of the intrusion and also gives a further option to describe the intrusion.Kavach, developed by Cron Systems, is a laser and infrared-based fencing system that is weatherproof and can be implemented in all kinds of terrainAccording to Chhabra, like any such system, Kavach is not 100% foolproof. There’s a certain number of false positives that occur, but the company is trying to keep the tolerance for such false positives very low.“Our biggest problem is pigs as their shape and size is similar to someone crawling on all fours,” says Chhabra, who spends a lot of his time at the border monitoring the system and helping with new installations. The company is currently piloting the system at the Samba sector in the Jammu frontier.The fences are interconnected and communicate with their base terminal via Cronnet, a virtual communication network that works on military grade encryption, developed inhouse by Cron.The fences are interconnected and communicate with their base terminal via Cronnet, a virtual communication network that works on military grade encryption, developed inhouse by CronGetting power in the border area is not a problem — the area is so well lit that the lighting can be seen even from space. But as a safety and precautionary measure, Kavach has a built-in power backup and management system that can keep the fence up and running for over eight hours without external power.The next iteration of Kavach will also include LIDAR (light detection and ranging) units that will give it better situational awareness on activities in its surroundings.Drones to soldiers’ aidCron Systems has also developed a system to help respond to the intrusion using autonomous vehicles and drones. The company has tied up with Israel-based manufacturer Automotive Robotic Industry (ARI), which makes all-terrain and weatherproof automated rovers called Amstaff. These rovers are capable of being fitted with anything from a firehose, to a taser, to even weapons, depending on the requirement.Cron Systems has also developed a system to help respond to the intrusion using autonomous vehicles and drones“If an intrusion happens, this vehicle will automatically leave for the intrusion space to inspect the area and assist the soldier. The integration is near complete and we are awaiting confirmation to begin live trials,” adds Chhabra.For drone integration, the company has tied up with Israel-based drone manufacturer Aerodrome.Big data on the borderAnother product the company is currently piloting at the border is its Control and Command(C&C) platform called Micron, which can work with any third-party sensor system more or less like a plug-and-play system to help collect and analyse data from it.“We wanted to avoid the need for multiple screens to monitor various sensor systems as it can get tiring and stressful at times. Once the Micron black box is deployed, all sensors can plug into them and can be monitored on a single system,” says Chhabra.Once an intrusion is detected, a message is sent to the base console unit, called the quick response tool, which prompts the on-duty soldier to take action with two options — ‘Secure’ or ‘SOS’. Image: Cron SystemsHe feels like any other industry, data collection and analysis are essential at the border as logging the movement of troops in the border areas is a long and tedious manual process.Chhabra feels that data collection and analysis are essential at the border as logging the movement of troops in the border areas is a long and tedious manual process“The BSF keeps a written log of everything that happens at the gates; how many times, how many soldiers pass by etc. This data is important to them and they go through it in case something goes wrong. So, we integrated Micron to help monitor these gates and collect data and analyse it,” he says.Kavach and Micron are also in the process of being prepared for pilots at other border regions of India.",0 followers,Venom Raj,1K,0,0,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-famous-defence-weapons-develop-in-India

So I would like to go a different way about this question.What are some 'infamous’ weapons developed in India?I am restricting myself to small arms systems.1.One the most controversial assault rifles in the world, maybe after the even more infamous L85. It's design was ingenious, meant to replace the old SLRs. But somewhere in the loop between implementation and manufacturing it turned into the mess it is today. The whole series isnt a failure. We have the mini INSAS , arguably one of the best and most popular submachine guns in the world. And we have the LMG. But the Assault rifle is a mess. The failures are well known, I won't repeat them( I have faced enough sadness in my life).But I have an argument to this. The INSAS has been tested in more environments than anyother modern assault rifle. In terms of the diverse battlefields it has faced, I would put it behind the durable AK series. So maybe it isn't all bad. And as usual the OFBs must have cut some corners on it.2. ExcaliburAnother INSAS derivative. Probably designed to cover the shortcomings in the above. But it was rejected by the Indian army on multiple occasions after it failed tests. The thing is as loud as a bull in a China shop. And the soldiers probably won't need a flashlight because the muzzle flash of this thing will blind the enemies. Though it covers some of the short comings of the INSAS it brings a few more problems into the equation.Though it has been inducted into some NE police forces because they operate in forests where the loudness and muzzle flash come in handy.3. Mini INSASI mentioned this before. This isn't infamous because of its shortcomings like the above. It has built itself a cult like followership around the world among the gamers.This UZI derivative has become a favourite of the 14-year old gang playing COD. Didn't recognise it yet?What about…Yes it is made in India! We finally made something which shoots without squirting hot oil on our face.Arguably one of the best submachine guns in the world.
