0,"Zcash (ZEC) is a privacy-oriented fork of the Bitcoin protocol, currently ranked 29th on the BraveNewCoin market cap table. The ZEC spot price is down 94% from the all time high set in January 2018. The market cap currently stands at US$357 million, with a reported 31% of the total market cap, or US$110 million, traded in the past 24 hours.A quick comparison between coins with privacy capabilities shows that ZEC is leading the total daily transaction volume by a wide margin. Other coins with privacy features include Monero (XMR), Zcash (ZEC), Grin (GRIN), and PIVX (PIVX). However, both XMR andZcash (ZEC) is a privacy-oriented fork of the Bitcoin protocol, currently ranked 29th on the BraveNewCoin market cap table.

Other coins with privacy features include Monero (XMR), Zcash (ZEC), Grin (GRIN), and PIVX (PIVX). However, both XMR and GRIN obscure the blockchain transaction values and addresses used.After much investigations and research i have made about how to earn more profit on cryptocurrency legitimately, I will recommend libraforex Investment Platform and cloud mining(www.libraforex,io) as it is relatively on for a while now as it was lunched mid 2016 but has become the largest Cryptocurrency Investment Platform right now with a volume of over 150 million dollars where you get different ROI’s of your invested cryptocurrency after every 10 days. It supports variety of cryptocurrency like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin and other Altcoins.The ZEC protocol is based on Zerocoin, which was developed in 2013 and later turned into Zerocash, with a difficulty adjustment algorithm adopted from DigiShield v3. The ZEC cryptocurrency went live in 2016 and trading began in late October 2016.The ZEC blockchain currently targets a 2.5 minute block time, with a block size limit of 2MB. The eventual total supply is 21 million, with a current annual inflation rate of 35.56% (brown, chart below). The ZEC inflation rate is among one of the highest of any cryptocurrency. To contrast, the current annual inflation rate of BTC, XMR, DASH, GRIN, and PIVX, are 3.87%, 3.65%, 6.89%, 157%, and 4.34%, respectively.Opposed to the ICO model, ZEC chose to use a ""Founders' Reward"" for funding development. The Founders’ Reward, which accounts for 10% of all ZEC minted, is distributed as follows; 5.72% for founders, employees, and advisors, 1.65% to initial investors, 1.44% to the Zcash Foundation, and 1.19% to the Electric Coin Company (ECC), formerly the Zcash Company. The ongoing incentive was designed to encourage a dedicated team to provide continual development for the project over several years. According to a Q3 transparency report, ECC operated at a deficit of 30% in Q1.The ECC is led by founder and CEO Zooko Wilcox. The Company constitutes what is described as “the creators and stewards of the Zcash currency.” Notable advisors included Bitcoin developer Gavin Andresen, Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin, and Tezos’ Arthur Breitman. Roger Ver was also one of the Zcash Company's initial investors.The Zcash Foundation, created in February 2017, is an independently operated 501(c)3 whose mission is “dedicated to building Internet payment and privacy infrastructure for the public good, primarily serving the users of the Zcash protocol and blockchain.” Current foundation members include Andrew Miller, Peter Van Valkenburgh, Amber Baldet, Matthew Green, and Ian Miers. Green and Miers were both part of the original ZEC founding team.Recently, the ECC and Zcash foundation have been at odds in regards to the ZEC trademark. The two parties issued a joint statement earlier this week reassuring the community that they are working on a mutually amicable agreement. The dispute has also delayed community sentiment collection for the next hard fork, currently scheduled for October. This debate occurs in the setting of Wilcox asking for further developer funding through a renewed Founders’ Reward, currently set to expire in October 2020.The Foundation has implemented several improvements to the ZEC ecosystem over the past few months. The Foundation announced Zepio in May, which is a privacy-focused wallet that sends shielded transactions by default. In June, the Foundation announced a partnership with Parity Technologies to release a new software client, Zebra. Written in Rust, the open-source client is an alternative to zcashd and brings redundancy should zcashd fail. The client is also designed to detect problems related to the consensus mechanism and implementation-specific bugs. ETH also has two clients, Parity and Geth, for similar reasons.The ZEC protocol leverages zk-SNARKs, or Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge, which are based on zero-knowledge proofs. The protocol uses zk-SNARKs for optional privacy elements. ZEC addresses beginning with a ""t"" are transparent, and addresses that start with a ""z"" include privacy enhancements and are referred to these as ""shielded addresses.""The ZEC protocol saw two upgrades in 2018, “Overwinter” on June 26th, and “Sapling” on October 29th. Both upgrades were enacted through hard forks, and both enhanced transaction efficiency and scalability for shielded addresses.The Sapling upgrade has reduced the zk-SNARK proving time from 37 seconds to 2.3 seconds, and introduced zc (legacy shielded) and zs (Sapling shielded) addresses. The shielded transaction count continues to represent a small fraction of total transactions, currently around 15% (blue line, chart below).The shielded pool would be much larger if exchanges did not disable the optional privacy functionality when sending ZEC. In December 2017, programmer jeffq discovered that shielded transactions on ZEC can be linked to non-shielded transactions unless both the sender and receiver were part of the “shielded pool” of anonymous transactions.The current total number of transactions per day on the network (line, chart below) stands at just over 3,000, which is down from a January 2018 high of 11,500 per day, but up from a February 2019 low of 2,000. Transactions per day are, on average, down from levels seen in 2018 and mid 2019. The average transaction value (fill, chart below) is currently US$4,800, up from an April 2018 low of US$62, and recently reached a new all-time high of nearly US$15,000.The average daily block size (line, chart below) has essentially sat at or near all-time lows since October 2018, indicating little network usage. The average transaction fee (fill, chart below) has declined since June 2018, but has risen since May 2019, and is currently US$0.013. The Sapling upgrade made shielded transfers 100 times smaller in size than before the upgrade, which in turn now makes these transactions cheaper to send.The 30-day Kalichkin network value to estimated on-chain daily transactions (NVT) ratio (line, chart below) has fallen dramatically since July 2019, now at an all-time low. A clear downtrend in NVT suggests a coin is undervalued based on its economic activity and utility, which should be seen as a bullish price indicator, whereas an uptrend in NVT suggests the opposite. The 15% of transactions which are shielded are not included in this calculation, meaning the true NVT is likely slightly lower than the metric suggests.Monthly active addresses (MAA) have declined substantially from the January 2018 high of 96,000 to the current 21,500 (fill, chart below). Active addresses are important to consider when determining the fundamental value of the network based on Metcalfe's law. ZEC has fewer MAAs than Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, EOS, DOGE, Dash, Bitcoin Cash, and Ethereum Classic.The market cap divided by the realized cap (MVRV) is another crypto-native fundamental metric used to asses overbought or oversold conditions. Realized cap approximates the value paid for all coins in existence by summing the market value of coins at the time they last moved on the blockchain. The metric was created through a combination of efforts by Murad Mahmudov, David Puell, Nic Carter, and Antoine Le Calvez.Historically, periods of an MVRV less than 0.4 have represented oversold conditions, whereas periods of an MVRV greater than 1.0 have represented overbought conditions. Of the MVRV levels above four since January 2013, all three have coincided with record highs in price. Currently, MVRV is 0.39 and falling, suggesting the possibility of oversold conditions.The ZEC network currently has 394 unique and active nodes, which is down from 600 in December 2018. Most of the nodes reside in Denmark, the United States, and France. ZEC uses the Equihash Proof of Work (PoW) algorithm, which was originally thought to be ASIC-resistant. However, Bitmain developed ASIC miners for the Equihash algorithm, which first went live on the network in May 2018, and shipped broadly in June 2018. All available Equihash ASICs are currently profitable at US$0.06 per KWh (below).In response to the rise in ASIC use on the chain, the ZEC foundation announced an initiative towards researching ASIC resistance on the chain and the ECC concluded that the “ultimate objective” is the broad inclusion of both hobbyists and professionals. The ZEC community voted and decided to discourage ASIC resistance as a priority and instead focus on currently unused PoW algorithms. Any future changes will need approval through the ZEC Improvement Proposal (ZIP) process.Hash rate and difficulty have continued to increase rapidly since April 2019, setting a new all-time high. The use of ASICs to mine a cryptocurrency can mean that the network becomes much less decentralized over time as the hardware continually squeezes out miners with less hashing power. While constant PoW adjustments decrease ASIC use substantially, the process may also lead to a different type of centralization through the need for constant node upgrades.The ZEC project on GitHub has 16 repositories with 451 commits on the main repo in the past year (top chart, shown below). The Zcash Improvement Proposals repo (bottom chart, shown below) has also been fairly active over the past year. Both repos mainly consist of commits by developers Daira Hopwood and str4d.Most coins use the developer community of GitHub where files are saved in folders called ""repositories,"" or ""repos,"" and changes to these files are recorded with ""commits,"" which save a record of what changes were made, when, and by who. Although commits represent quantity and not necessarily quality, a higher number of commits can signify higher dev activity and interest.The upcoming “Blossom” upgrade is slated for October 28th, 2019 and will include shorter block times. The ECC also has some early plans to build a new chain with sharding and privacy by default. This process would also involve a chain migration, which is similar to the pending migration from ETH 1.0 to ETH 2.0.In the markets, ZEC exchange traded volume over the past 24 hours has predominantly been led by the Bitcoin (BTC) and Tether (USDT) pairs. ZEC has continued to gain exchange listing over the past two years, being added to; Gemini exchange in May 2018, Bittrex in September 2018, Coinbase in December 2018, and eToro earlier this year. Binance also added ZEC/BNB, ZEC/USDT, ZEC/PAX, ZEC/TUSD and ZEC/USDC pairs in March.PS: This article is subject to personal opinion.

According toBitcoin mining is the process by which transactions are verified and added to the public ledger, known as the blockchain, and also the means through which new bitcoins are released. Anyone with access to the internet and suitable hardware can participate in mining. The mining process involves compiling recent transactions into blocks and trying to solve a computationally difficult puzzle. The participant who first solves the puzzle gets to place the next block on the blockchain and claim the rewards. The rewards, which incentivize mining, are both the transaction fees associated with the transactions compiled in the block as well as newly released bitcoin.Read more:Mining Vs FarmingSo, by definition, we understand that farming refers to huge server houses where either an organization or a pool of miners conduct mining. But CryptoCurrency mining can be anywhere, in server houses, at homes( also known as, Solo Mining).How Bitcoin Farming WorksFarmers use their machines and specialized software to solve a block. If your machine is the first one to solve the problem, you get rewarded with a small token fee. These farms are also a very necessary part of any cryptocurrency's ecosystem. The more the farmers or miners are there, the faster and more efficient will be the cryptocurreny.Each solved block is attached to the previous block in the ledger which gave rise to the term blockchain. These blocks make sure that no one can scam anyone by re-transacting the same coins again and again and maintains the integrity of the system.…”","26,883 followers",Rohit Malshe,1.3K,327,11.4M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Is-ZCash-ZEC-a-dead-coin

This means on average I mine 0.04952418 BTC per day, using 5,442 watts of power. My marginal electricity cost is USD $0.1139 per kWh, so at the current (at the moment) bitcoin price of $380.99, I am making a profit of $3.99 per day. The reason I call it an educational hobby, however, is that the total return on the project since September, 2013, is -27.2 percent if I turned everything into dollars today. I keep the bitcoin I mine in bitcoin, because only an increase in the value of bitcoin could make the project profitable overall. My expenses so far are 72% equipment and 28% electricity, but of course that puts no value on the (large) amount of time I spent working on this. I've learned an amazing amount about bitcoin in the process, so I consider it a win either way.Update December 29, 2015: Bitcoin mining difficulty has increased significantly, the worldwide network is now making 786 quadrillion mining guesses per second. I am now mining 0.03299220 BTC per day, my marginal electricity cost has risen to USD $0.1152 per kWh, and at the current bitcoin price of USD $430.73, I am currently overpaying for the bitcoins I mine to the tune of USD $0.85 per day. My mine uses USD $455.56 worth of electricity to mine one bitcoin. On the other hand, the garage keeps the rest of the house warm in winter, so it's roughly a break-even operation for the time being. The overall operation would be -16.8 percent if I turned everything into dollars today, expenses so far are 70% equipment and 30% electricity. If bitcoin prices rise to USD $518 then I'm in the black.Update January 10, 2016: Rising bitcoin mining difficulty is taking its toll. Mining 0.02967912 BTC per day, but it costs USD $15.08 in electricity per day to operate the mine, so my effective BTC cost is USD $508.10. With the current market price of BTC at USD $440, it doesn't make sense to run much longer unless bitcoin prices rise.

Individual blocks must contain a proof of work to be considered valid. This proof of work is verified by other Bitcoin nodes each time they receive a block. Bitcoin uses the hashcash proof-of-work function.The primary purpose of mining is to allow Bitcoin nodes to reach a secure, tamper-resistant consensus. Mining is also the mechanism used to introduce Bitcoins into the system: Miners are paid any transaction fees as well as a ""subsidy"" of newly created coins.This both serves the purpose of disseminating new coins in a decentralized manner as well as motivating people to provide security for the system.Bitcoin mining is so called because it resembles the mining of other commodities: it requires exertion and it slowly makes new currency available at a rate that resembles the rate at which commodities like gold are mined from the ground.",242 followers,Sumit Kumar,2.2K,0,0,2019,https://www.quora.com/How-can-I-start-bitcoin-mining-and-earn-money-from-it

BitcoinStill dominating in market cap and popularity, Bitcoin isn’t going anywhere soon. It still makes all the headlines and is what most people think about when they hear the word cryptocurrency.Bitcoin has turned into the go to cryptocurrency for traders. But for investors, who can hold through the volatility, they see advantages to bitcoin as well. Once 21 million bitcoins have been mined, no new coins will be created ever.Looking at it from a supply/demand stand point, long-term investors stand to gain. Plus, Bitcoin is the base currency that you need to purchase if you want to end up getting some of the other currencies on this list. You can’t simply buy many of these others with USD – you need BTC.2. EthereumEthereum was initially seen as the cryptocurrency that could shove bitcoin off of its thrown as the dominant currency. It didn’t work out that way but Ethereum holds a solid #2 by market cap.Ethereum did provide a few enhancements over bitcoin. Namely smart contracts and 5X higher transactions per second (TPS) than bitcoin.3. LitecoinLitecoin has similarities in its infrastructure to bitcoin. Litecoin’s transaction fees are far less, at around $0.35 per transaction. Just like Ethereum, Litecoin also has higher TPS than bitcoin.Litecoin has an $81 million cap on coins that can be mined. This means Litecoin could potentially see steady increases in price, depending on future demand. Litecoin is currently ranked at #5 by marketcap so it isn’t a slouch by any means.4. RippleRipple is more than just an exchange of value. It helps make cross border financial transactions more efficient. By working with financial institutions, Ripple lowers currency exchange rates and provides for real-time exchange rates.Before Ripple, banks often had to use intermediaries for cross border transactions. These were expensive and could takes days to complete. Ripple has greatly improved efficiencies in how cross border transactions operate.For an investor, this shows that Ripple is providing real value in the world beyond the basic store or exchange of value premise.5. ZcashZcash stands for Zerocash protocol. It is a derivative of the bitcoin codebase. It’s main difference is anonymity of transactions. With bitcoin, each transaction in the blockchain is public information. Zcash wants to change that.Just as you can pay in cash and no one has to know anything about you, Zcash wants to allow the same for cryptocurrencies. There won’t be a way to trace the origin or destination of transactions. Transactions in the blockchain will remain confidential.Zcash is also faster than bitcoin. Zcash has climbed from less than $30 in the first half of 2017 to over $2,000 today.Zcash is also looking to put together a Zcash focused conference called Zcon0, which can bring awareness to the cryptocurrency. Additionally, it made news last year when JP Morgan decided to use it on their blockchain platform to enhance Ethereum smart contracts.Zcash has steadily been rising in price and has proven itself as a useful cryptocurrency. It’s ideal for those looking to utilize the bitcoin codebase but with privacy and speed enhancements.6. StellerSteller’s functionality is similar to that of Ripple on the surface. Under the hood, it goes about things a little different. Both cryptocurrencies help in the fast exchange of currencies and at low cost. Steller is different in that it uses remittance companies and credits but the end result is still very similar to Ripple.Even though Steller uses a different approach from Ripple, it doesn’t mean it is any less efficient. It can complete currency exchanges in less than 5 seconds for a fraction of a cent.Investing in Steller and Ripple can provide for diversification of approaches within the cross border transaction space.7. NEMNEM allows both public and private transactions on its blockchain. For anyone company wanting to integrate blockchain technology, NEM can be written in a wide array of programming languages. This has commercial appeal since companies won’t have to bring in a new tech team to integrate a blockchain. They can likely use the tech they already know.For investors, this means NEM potentially has better commercial adoption than other cryptocurrencies.8. IOTAIOTA is the go-to cryptocurrency for any company wanting to utilize blockchain technology with IoT devices. It’s blockchain makes communication between IoT devices more efficient.Given the increasing use of IoT devices, the advantages of IOTA should be clear.9. MoneroLike Zcash, Monero focuses on anonymity of transactions in the blockchain. Both cryptocurrencies use different algorithms to accomplish this. Of the two, Monero is more technically advanced when it comes to completely hiding any trace of a transaction.Monero is also older than Zcash and wasn’t derived from bitcoin. Monero has a large following among users wanting to keep their transactions private, even from regulators.For investors, they’ll need to stay on top of how Monero handles future regulations. If it can successfully navigate regulation, it stands to come out on top of the privacy cryptocurrencies.10. CardanoCardano allows for sending and receiving of digital funds. It’s more than just a cryptocurrency though, it’s also a platform for decentralized apps. It was built by a global team and has the goal of providing broad scale use of financial transactions (think VISA).Cardano is currently ranked #6 by market cap. This shows great interest in the cryptocurrency. For investors, Cardano has a big mission but also lots of developers, which bode well for its future.Final ThoughtsRemember, investing in any cryptocurrency is highly speculative. All of these currencies provide some value, but at the end of the day, you’re only betting on price. You’re hoping that someone else will pay more for the investment than you did.Be sure that you are only committing funds that you are comfortable losing.",0 followers,Gerhard Walter,1.1K,54,915.7K,2019,https://www.quora.com/Is-ZCash-ZEC-a-dead-coin
9,"To begin my answer, I’ll start by quoting a Papercoins’ review of what I similarly believe to be the best cryptocurrency to invest in 2019:The SYS blockchain protocol is a platform that has strong core features that allow for developing fast, secure and most of all low-cost dapps (decentralized applications).

The chain uses a Z-DAG technology which counters the double-spend attack and allows transactions to be processed in real-time. (60,000 TPS)One of the main features of the new SYS 4.0 network is the power to allow two way bridging of chains. This will allow for other networks to be able to benefit from the features of SYS, while granting their own benefits to SYS. For example, SYS can bridge into the Ethereum network to take advantage of their smart contract features, but also allow Ethereum to bridge to SYS and use Z-DAG technology.SYS can be used for a wide range of purposes, such as game transactions, selling digital goods, exchanges, and many more products & services that require to be on the blockchain for security and scalability.They also have a solid list of partners which include Komodo, a multichain blockchain, Microsoft Azure, Blocknorth, Blocknet, and DIF.A big advantage of stacking on SYS would also be the low current marketcap.
