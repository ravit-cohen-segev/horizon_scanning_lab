Hell, we’re having enough trouble just surviving on our own planet for which we are perfectly adapted.Travelling at the speed of light (basically impossible) might seem to be the holy grail of exploring the galaxy, but it’s not. Light speed is fast, but compared to the size of the universe, it’s slow. The closest star is four years away at the speed of light.The energy required to accelerate anything with mass to just below the speed of light in inconceivable, and basically outside the realm of our most advanced technology. Yes, there are theoretical drives, ion, Em-drive, but it’s all hypothetical twaddle.Even IF we could transfer human intelligence/identity into a machine, and shrink that machine down to the size of an atom, and accelerate that atom to .9c, it would still take years to get to the nearest star. Traveling in Einsteinian space is just a deal-breaker. Plus, there’s way too much crap floating around out there to slow us down.Even if we were able to imbue massless particles like photons or cosmic rays with human intelligence, we’d still be stuck with this massive, debris filled universe that just slows everything down… even light. artThe only way humans will ever explore the galaxy (let alone the universe) is to breach the dimensional barriers of normal 4D space-time. Whether that means going quantum, or discovering some sort of wormhole technology, warping/folding space, utilizing artificially created black holes, as long as we’re limited to moving in an Einsteinian universe, we’re not going anywhere.If there are beings out there capable of doing this, you can rest assured they are not visiting us. Why? Because to them, as life forms go, we are not much different than amoeba, or bacteria. We think of ourselves as highly intelligent creatures. We’ve done what would seem to be some pretty amazing stuff… a periodic table of elements, particle accelerators, fusion bombs, lasers… we’ve played around with some of the fundamental “stuff” of creation. To a space-faring species, what we are doing with our “technology” is the equivalent of Australopithecus picking lice out of each other’s fur.Does any human alive today remember what it was like to be an Australopithecus? Of course not. We don’t even remember what it was like to be Cro-Magnon. The experience of being “less evolved” primates has been lost to the millennia. It’s gone from our collective memory as a species. All we know is being Homo Sapien.A space-faring species would be so far evolved on the evolutionary scale, that even if they were once humanoid, they would not even remember being such. They could visit Earth, but they could not look at us and think, “oh look, intelligent creatures that are similar to what we were a million years ago.” Nope. We are worms. Rotifers. Dung beetles.

The last time we tried that was with convicts, and nobody much cared if they survived or not.I think it could be possible to build largely self-sustaining outposts at various locations throughout our solar system.

Will we? I disagree that it is not worth sending a probe which will only report back centuries after the people who sent it are dead. If we can build such long lived machines we should spend our treasure to send one. We should configure it to send data continuously and monitor it all the way to the destination, learning every step of the way. Before it has arrived we should keep sending probes, and then generation ships once we have mapped the way and know it to be survivable. Even if it is not safe we need to expand our footprint or suffer the fate of the extinct species before us whose failure to become truly cosmopolitan meant that they were vulnerable to a catastrophic local change in environment. The only thing you can do is make a plan, lay the cornerstone and then suffer through the hard work and loss and plague and fire until it is done.","105,668 followers",Dave Consiglio,3K,6.8K,91.6M,2015,https://www.quora.com/In-what-year-do-you-think-humanity-will-leave-the-Solar-System

Cold vacuum that is many many more times uninhabitable than water. As of now, part of our research is dedicated to crossing/managing that vaccum barrier. Also, a lot of our efforts are being spent in finding habitable planets, and making uninhabitable planets into habitable. Since a lot of habitable planets are very very far away, we are also researching on how to get there fasterAlso, what binds us to Earth is gravity. Early humans didn't have to climb out a gravity well. A lot of research is going into overcoming gravity. We do have a solution for this, albeit a very expensive one.I'm pretty sure early humans didn't give a damn about what they found on the other side, or how they will get there. They just went. Many of them died before they reached the other side.  We are too scared to leave the Earth. IMO, we should invest in creating lifeboats. Create self-sustaining ecosystem that can be hosted on a multi-generational starship, and let's just go! Allonz-y!. If some of us die, we die. IMO, if we wait for technological advancements to solve all the problems before we get out of here, we will all die here.","2,489 followers",David Lewinnek,2K,437,4.5M,2015,https://www.quora.com/In-what-year-do-you-think-humanity-will-leave-the-Solar-System

I do believe that life exists in many places in the universe, but I do exclude spaceships from another solar system visiting earth because the distances are so huge and travel faster than the speed of light, are prevented by gravity and the physical laws as we know them. With our current technology, it would take about 40,000 years to travel to Alpha Centauri, our nearest extrasolar star system, only a little more than 4 light-years away, while the majority of the solar systems and galaxies in the universe lies hundreds, even thousands, yes even billions of light-years away. If we imagine that we, in the far future, will have the technology to reach 25% of the speed of light, this speed approximately means we could fly so fast that we could circle around the earth 2 times in one second. However, this speed is nevertheless utopia because we would not be able to bring as much energy as needed to reach that speed, and then we need a similar amount of energy to slow down again.With our current technology, we can travel to the Moon, we can land and then travel back to earth again, we can also travel to Mars and land, but we cannot return to earth, because Mars gravity prevents it, we cannot bring as much energy as necessary for the return trip. So, we need to invent another form of energy there doesn't take much space.","15,093 followers",Jason Almendra,1.5K,21.3K,105.4M,2020,https://www.quora.com/In-what-year-do-you-think-humanity-will-leave-the-Solar-System

Really, the problem is that either the journey will take too long, or relativistic speeds mean that any small particle that impacts the craft will cause incredible damage. One of the most promising solutions lies in the Alcubierre drive, which creates a bubble of sorts in spacetime and allows superluminal travel through exterior spacetime while maintaining subluminal velocity inside the bubble. Another solution lies in high-energy drives, perhaps fusion-powered, and heavy shielding.Before interstellar flight, we need to have an established space manufacturing industry, the technology for a very advanced drive system, truly closed-loop life support, and a better knowledge of what might be waiting for us at other stars, among other things.Many of those requirements could be met within decades, but some might take centuries. It depends on how much the human race decides to care about space exploration and technological development. Like I said, 2100 is probably an early timeline, but perhaps 2200 is not unreasonable.

In easy words, they will increase our heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate. ( because our ancestor hunter gatherers used focused vision to hunt wild animals, and they needed to race their heart out to catch it)In today's world, focussed vision gets activated when we look at our mobile phones, tv, laptop etc and thus increases our stress even more.I will tell you a simple trick how to de-stress with scientific evidence.There is another thing called PANOROAMIC VISION, that is, where our field of vision expands. For example, while looking at the sky, or looking at the cliff, or even the huge roads beside your home. Like this.It activates the parasympathetic nervous system, that is, it decreases heart rate, blood pressure, etc etc, and hence reduces stress.So next time, when you feel anxious, don't pick up the phone.

Many superpowers and big nations got involved in this fierce battle of supremacy.This war went on till 1945, millions and millions of soldiers died and there is no proper official count of the number of civilians who died. The resources (mainly monetary and army) of almost every nation involved in this war got exhausted badly. Since, Britain was one of the biggest superpower involved in this battle, it was hit very badly by this.At that time, numerous colonies were under the control of Britain including India. After the war was over, Britain was in no position to hold on to the vast colonial empire it built during the peak of it’s supremacy. It found the colonies, particularly the big ones like India, extremely difficult to manage.So, what led Britishers grant Independence to India?There were several factors responsible for it.1.The Indian army and Naval fleet also revolted against Britishers in the meantime which led to further instability in addition to depletion of resources.2. Winston Churchill was the Prime Minister of Britain at that time and he was hell bent on not granting Independence to India despite having such conditions. He was so determined about that is very much evident from the fact that when Governor of India that time called him and stated.“Sir! We gotta do something about India. The Navy and Army has revolted, there is heavy instability and I cannot assure you of anything of what could happen in the next 24 hours!”But, he still refused to do anything despite hearing this.But, fortunately the elections happened at that time in Britain and a new prime minister named Clement Attlee came to power. He was pro India and immediately issued orders to grant India independence.When second world war started, many leaders asked Mahatma Gandhi to start a revolt at that time as the Britishers were in a very vulnerable position at that time and it would be a good time to easily get independence from them but he refused stating this.“We will not revolt against the Britishers as they are vulnerable as we should not raise our voices against a power who is weak right now!”I still don’t understand what his motive actually was. But as the powerful write history their own way, congress too wrote the history it’s own way that is now known to many Indians in a very tainted way.In addition, when Clement Attlee was asked about the most important person who played a pivotal role in getting India independence, he answered.Subhash Chandra bose and World war 2. Gandhi’s role was a bare minimum!Since, Subhash Chandra Bose was not liked by Gandhi, his role in the Indian Independence has been completely erased from the History pages.One more question for all of you to ponder upon.If Gandhi was so popular and everybody was in his favour, why Pattabhi Sitaramaiyya, a candidate of Gandhi against Subhash Chandra Bose, lost to Bose in 1938 congress elections?Rohan :)",485 followers,Rohan Khandelwal,16.6K,505,26.6M,2019,https://www.quora.com/If-IG-88-succeeded-in-his-Droid-rebellion-legends-what-would-have-been-the-future-of-Star-Wars-Would-technology-improve

This is 1919. After that, one by one, all the sons were taken abroad and got information about new techniques. The business was so successful that a shop was also opened in Rangoon.When Mohanlal went to Germany once, he bought machines worth sixty thousand rupees from there so that we change the business. In those days Parle of Bombay used to be a village. There he bought an old abandoned warehouse and set up a toffee making factory.A total of twelve people, including the five sons of Mohanlal, were engaged in the work.

Most of us have been conditioned to think that the way to get someone to like us is by doing nice little favors for them, thereby demonstrating that we are a thoughtful and dependable person. Old Benji thought differently.Franklin once had a very powerful political rival who was hellbent on making his life miserable. Franklin knew that it would be beneficial to have this man on his side, but instead of groveling for his approval, he took a counter-intuitive approach. He knew his rival was in possession of a very rare and valuable book, and simply asked him to borrow it. After a few days, he returned it with a thank you note and, surprisingly, his rival became his friend.What Franklin tapped into is a well-known psychological principle known as cognitive dissonance. Basically, cognitive dissonance is the tension that results from having two contradictory beliefs in our mind at the same time.

In his nine and a half decades on earth, he has never lacked,When he wants food, he goes to the banana plantation, looks at tens of bunches ofHe also has about 20 goats. In Uganda, goat milk was generally not considered palatable, possibly due to the abundance of cow milk, so we never milked goats. He would sell a couple of them to supplement income from other produce to send his children to school. He also reared a couple of chickens, more as a hobby.The farm produces more than he can consume. He sells the surplus to afford such essential services as kerosene (recently upgraded to solar), soap, sugar (at his age he no longer takes sugar, he uses honey — doctor’s orders).Scattered across the farm are sugarcane (for eating, not for making sugar) and fruit trees (guava, mango, pawpaw, avocado, orange, passion fruit, pineapple). He drinks fresh juice from mangoes and passion fruit. As is evident, everything here is on a subsistence basis, but very organic. He has done this for the past 75 years.He had eleven children, my mother being his first born. He sent all of them to school, saw eight of them through college. He sold at least two cows, some goats and some produce each school term to send his children to school.I went to live at grandfather’s place when I was 5 years old. I left when I was 14 (my family lived in an urban area). I learnt how to farm, milk cows, tether goats, harvest fruits (by climbing the fruit tree) and harvesting honey (at night using smoke).Why the long story?My grandfather, just like millions of other Africans that live like him, is considered poor. He rarely holds money, and he rarely needs it. He produces most of what he needs. But using the standard World Bank/IMF description of ‘poor’, my grandfather is poor. I live in the city and earn about USD 12,000 a year after tax, which in Uganda is a decent salary. But I can hardly match my grandfather in terms of providing for my family with fresh milk, fresh food and fresh fruits.This is one thing most people that watch International media do not know about Africa: not all Africans are poor, many simply live differently than you.(Image source:Ugandan farmer riding bananas from his farm to the market.

For those that were murdered in the gas chambers they didn’t think they were about to die. They thought they were being showered before registration into the camp. By the time they realized what was happening, they were in a dark room quickly filling with Cyanide gas.But- the Jews that knew very often fought back.Operation Reinhard was a 2-year long effort to kill every Jew the Germans could find. In 4 extermination camps, almost 2 million people would be gassed and killed from late 1941 - late 1943. In 2 of these camps though, there were revolts, and thanks to these revolts- there were survivors.I am going to focus on Sobibor because I think it is very interesting and even badass.Sobibor was an extermination camp where 250,000 had been murdered. As 1943 was coming to a close the camp prisoners noticed that prisoners from Belzec (another extermination camp) had been sent to Sobibor and murdered after they dismantled and shut down their own camp.The prisoners knew they would soon be killed when Sobibor was shut down so they came up with a brilliant plan.Out of this, a resistance group was formed. They brainstormed ideas but soon got very lucky when a number of Soviet POWs arrived at the camp as more laborers, among them Alexander ‘Sasha’ Pechersky.Sasha impressed everyone. During one of his first work details, he was placed outside the camp to cut down trees. When the SS guard started whipping Jewish laborers for cutting too slowly Sasha protested.The SS guard, amused by this, challenged Sasha to a challenge. If Sasha could cut down a tree in 5 minutes he would win a pack of smokes. If not, he would get 25 lashes. Sasha agreed and 4.5 minutes later the tree was cut down. When the SS guard offered smokes Sasha said “thanks but I don’t smoke. The SS guard then returned with bread and butter and Sasha said “no thank you, the rations I receive satisfy me fully”.This act of defiance became a rallying cry in the camp. Pretty soon Sasha was one of the leaders of the resistance.After a plan to tunnel out of the camp failed, they settled on an all-out revolt.What took place is brilliant.On October 14th 1943 the time was now. The camps commander, who was gifted at rooting out conspiracies, had left the camp with his aides. This was the time for the prisoners to strike.They would designate combat teams in every barracks. These combat teams were the strongest men armed with crude weapons.The prisoners then lured the SS guards to various locations. They would say “hey we have some new coats confiscated, come pick one out” and stuff like that. SS guards were lured to tailor shops, storerooms, shoe shining places, and other buildings where combat teams lie in wait.First the camp commander SS Untersturmfuher Johann Niemann had his head split in by an axe. Then, every 6 minutes for the next hour an SS Officer was killed.No alarm was sounded so far- things were going well. There was a problem though. Karl Frenzel, the most feared of the SS, had been late to his appointment and was thus still alive. Additionally, many killings had been far too public.At this point, Sasha was sure the plot would soon be discovered as bodies were located.Sasha then gave a speech to the assembled prisoners.Our day has come. Most of the Germans are dead. Let's die with honor. Remember, if anyone survives, he must tell the world what has happened here!The prisoners charged- using the pistols and rifles they had stolen. All-out chaos broke out as the prisoners got to the gate and nearby fences and clamored over.The remaining SS Guards realize what is happening and open fire. Combat breaks out between the guards and prisoners. Hundreds of prisoners are slaughtered but many guards are gunned down from prisoners returning fire.A few hundred get over the fence and head for the forest. Landmines kill many as others are gunned down.In total, 150 are killed in the breakout, well over 100 were killed by mines in the forest, and a further 107 are hunted down and killed in the following days.208 escaped with their lives though, and 58 would survive until the end of the war to testify what happened at Sobibor.Sasha would steward a group of 50 Jews through the forest before abandoning them and making his way to the Red Army. He would survive the war and die in 1990 at the age of 80.These 58 survivors would be the only people to survive Sobibor.Treblinka had a similar revolt/escape where prisoners looted the armory, used grenades to destroy the camp, and made a dash for the gate. Here too almost everyone was killed but 70 managed to survive.1.8 million Jews were sent to Treblinka, Belzec, and Sobibor. Of those 1.8 million, only 178 survived. 50 escaped Belzec during its operation, 58 escaped Sobibor during the uprising, and 70 escape Treblinka during their uprising.This means these camps killed 99.992% of those sent there.

Moreover, they have engineers from Audi and Lamborghini to develop these cars, so it is, almost impossible to produce a car that can beat Bugatti.In 2017, they made new record for fastest 0–400–0 kmphr in 41.96 seconds.But here comes the twist.After 3 weeks of this new record, Christian von Koenigsegg came with his Agera RS!!!Broke Chiron's record like a BossIt was faster just by 5 seconds than the previous record held by Chiron, so many people will say what is the big deal in breaking this record??His company Koenigsegg, doesn't have facilities like Bugatti. He can't spend millions of dollars just on R&D and he cannot afford to have engineers from Audi or Lamborghini. He started his company from his own money - you can see in the picture that he is sitting near his car with just one mechanic.He was able to beat world's most expensive car with his hard work and dedication, for him there was no excuse that Bugatti has everything better than us. All he focused upon is how he can make something better than anyone else.Many times people don't wish to grow or are not able to compete because they think that someone out there is already better than them. So thinking like loser is just a mindset, not a reality .Hard work can achieve your dream. Your only limit is your own thinking .No dream is too big.

Just like elephants,hippos,rhynos….A tiger is more powerful than a lion, they are the strongest and heaviest from the big cats family, but still a Tiger is not called a king.Here are the reasons.1.Lions are social cats,they live in a specific territories in a pride(group of lions), a healthy pride consists of 20–30 lions out of them 2–3 male lions and 5–10 female lions and rest are cubs.The Lionesses hunt the prey and feed the family while the male lion guards the territory from other foreign male lions.2.A male lion protects its cubs from outside intruders3.All the male juvenile lions have to leave their home pride at the age of 2–3 years to find their own. They travel hundreds of miles to invade a foreign territory,to do that they have to defeat that foreign territories protectors (male lions in that pride).4.Every male lion has to undergo this gruesome battle i.e the process of occupying a foreign territory is called the PRIDE TAKEOVER. Once after taking over a pride the first thing they do is to kill all the cubs of the former male lions.Lions won’t tolerate the bloodline of other ones. The lioness tries to defend their cubs but sometimes they wont even hesitate to kill the lioness too if it turns against.5.They mate with the females of occupied pride and start raising their cubs. And there comes a new family. .They roam in the nights defending their cubs, roaring and sending signals to other lions that its their boundary and they will have to pay the price if it enters in their territory.The chance of survival for the first 1–2 years of a lions life is all about the destiny and at the mercy of their fathers strength and ability to defend them, either they die in the hands of other foreign male lions or they survive.And the male lions death in the battle of pride takeover is one of the brutal deaths in the animal world. They don’t hesitate to give up their lives in protecting their families,just as a king protects his kingdom at the cost of his own life. So a male lion receives lot of respect in their pride,they are the first one to eat the meal. Male lions rarely hunt, they generally come into the picture while taking down large preys like elephants,giraffes,rhynos,hippos….So knowing all these no one can disagree with the fact why they are called KING OF JUNGLE.Being king is not all about strength,courage,dominance.Its more about Protecting their own families.","1,062 followers",Mandi Bailes,20.5K,101,958.8K,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-do-you-know-that-most-people-don%E2%80%99t

How cool is that?Rao was a modern day Chanakya who led India through crucial times building the nation as we know it today, all the while making a mark as a distinguished scholar as well.He was a polyglot who knew 17 different languages in all including 9 Indian and 8 foreign ones but guess what, human languages were not the only ones he excelled at but also computer languages as well which were popular at that time.Back in 1984, the incumbent PM, Rajiv Gandhi in one of his meetings remarked that he intended to open up electronics and computer imports to India. ‘But the old guard in my party will not understand,’ is what he had said to make his contempt for his defence minister, Rao, apparent who was at a ripe age of 63 then.Computers were just a novelty then - even in the US where researchers were at the forefront pounding away at all of the possibilities a beast like this could unleash. The prime minister wanted it in India and thought old fogies like Rao would impede the induction of new technologies.But what Rajiv didn't know was Rao’s voracious appetite for learning. That evening, he called up his son, Prabhakara, an engineer in the US. ‘You keep talking about this computer thing. What is it? Send me one,’ Rao said. The next day, Prabhakara sent a prototype to Delhi. Prabhakara also hired a computer specialist to teach his father. Ever the technophile, Rao bought manuals to read on his own, and within fifteen days, told the specialist he was redundant. Over the years, Rao would master two computer languages, COBOL and BASIC, and would also go on to write code in the mainframe operating system UNIX.Not sure if even Rajiv Gandhi, who is touted as the one who brought the IT revolution in India, could ever do that himself. It was only a matter of time then before Rajiv had to concede ground and Rao became indispensable.He had a personal interest in these machines as a little later in his life as PM, he would wake up at 5 a.m. in his bungalow at the race course road, his official residence as the prime minister, would walk to the adjoining room and fiddle with his computer until the newspapers arrived at 6 a.m. where he use to type his reflections on that period in his life in a digital diary he maintained on his computer, which remain to this day private.His personal interest in computers is also evident from one of his public speeches while inaugurating the IT-ASIA conference where he could not resist lodging a customer complaint: ‘I use one package of word processing. For years the upgrades are coming and when I look into the literature of what the upgrade means . . . I find very little difference . . . I think we should be careful about these things. You skip four upgrades, maybe the fifth will be really useful to you. It will mean a real upgrade. Pardon me, saying so. This has happened to me.’For me, he remains the best PM we could ever afford till date who built the 'New India' as we know it today.

Coins with unserrated edges (like a nickel) tend to be slightly more biased too.Flipping a coin could get you a similar bias, too. If you flick a coin into the air and let it fall onto a hard surface to reveal the result, the coin often ends up spinning before settling anyway. And, as we learned earlier, a spinning coin is way more often than not a tails-up coin. Note that older pennies may not give you quite as pronounced a bias as newer ones. It's gross, but you have to account for all the dirt, grime, and other junk that can build up on coins over time and throw off the center of mass.",158 followers,Abhyuday Pratap Singh,16.5K,0,0,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-do-you-know-that-most-people-don%E2%80%99t

In an interview he said - he preffered 10 because 10 in also in his surname ( TEN_dulkar) so he chooses 10 as his jersey number.(2) Virat Kohli - Virat Kohli preferred 18 as a jersey number because on this date his father died so he thinks when he wears his jersey his father is with him.(3) Hardik Pandya - Hardik Pandya's jersey number is 228. Hardik Pandya was playing under-16 match against Vadodara in which he scored 228 runs in this match to assure a big win to his team. Since then, Hardik has a jersey number 228.(4) Rahul Dravid - Rahul Dravid firstly uses 5 as jersey number but after his marriage he changed it to 19 because his wife's birthday is 19 and he thinks his wife is lucky for his career.(5) Mahendra Singh Dhoni - Dhoni chooses 7 as his jersey number because his birthday is on 7 july. He is also a fan of Cristiano Ronaldo so he choose 7 as his jersey number ( Suggested by Aditya Thakare in the comment section ).(6) Rohit Sharma - Rohit Sharma chooses 45 but his favourite number is 9 because this number is already taken by Parthiv patel that's why his mother suggested him to choose 45 because (4+5 = 9).This is chronology of jersey numbers I think I wrote what I want to write :)Thankyou for scrolling!Have a great day!EDIT 1 - One reader asked about the jersey number 69. Is it used by any player? So answer is yes. Lockie Ferguson ( Newzealand cricketer ) wore this jersey number but after that match he changed it to another number. Now this number (69) banned in cricket due to it's DOUBLE MEANING. None can use this number as his/her Jersey number.There are also many numbers which are banned. They are 420 (the weed number) and 666 (Satan - devil's number). These numbers are also banned due to their double meanings.EDIT 2 - Yuvraj Singh used to wear jersey number 12 because he was born on December 12 in the 12th hour of the day at sector 12. I don’t think there is much explaining to do as to why he wears this jersey.

You've seen them on TV. They're the dentists advertising and promoting Sensodyne.But if you see carefully,Sensodyne is a company based in UK. It originated in US and was then bought by GlaxoSmithKline. And their advertisements feature dentists practising in UK. Even those advertisements which are meant to be broadcast in India.I first saw the advertisement quite a few years back, when I was in school. And I wondered,Why is it that dentists in UK are promoting a brand in India? Why aren't dentists practising in India featuring in these advertisements?Then I entered med school. I'm a 3rd year student right now. But while studying in 2nd year, I found the answer to this question.It's too much of reading. Let me simplify it for you.The Medical Code of Ethics for Doctors states thatDoctors registered and practising in India cannot associate themselves and advertise a particular medicine, brand, treatment or product. Doctors cannot receive gifts and/or money from pharmaceutical companies in lieu of promotion or advertising. Nor can doctors feature in advertisements and promote their practise and/or medicines, brands, treatments or products.Yes, doctors can feature in interviews to give information or educate the people regarding public health aspects or general health measures, but it has to be in a manner without promoting their medical practice or enticing patients to consult them.This same code applies to dentists as well.So where does Sensodyne come in?Sensodyne shot their advertisements with dentists NOT practicing in India, hence those dentists are out of the reach of Indian law.At the same time, very smartly, they put in a line behind the name of each dentist, “Practising in UK”. This gives them two advantages:I have no grudge against Sensodyne. I'm not saying it is a bogus company. Whether its products works or not, I don't know.Compared to this, the other brands like Colgate, Close-up, Oral B, etc. are not fooling the public. They simply recruit actors or models to pose as doctors. No names shown, no unethical advertising.Moral:..EDIT:I hope I have made it clear that real doctors are not supposed to appear in commercials and the fact that sensodyne has fooled people into expecting that to happen, is wrong.",628 followers,Ayush Jain,14.3K,0,0,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-do-you-know-that-most-people-don%E2%80%99t

The corner of the plates are round, so that it doesn’t hurt or injure anyone.4. “IND” is written on the leftmost center, and it should be in blue color only.5. There is a hot stamped chromium based hologram on the leftmost top corner of the plate, which cannot be removed just by scratching it.6. There is a unique code on the leftmost bottom corner of the plate, which contains all the details of the vehicle like the owner of the vehicle, registered RTO, registered state and information of the dealer too.7. The plates are fixed on the vehicles with snap locks, which cannot be removed once fixed. They can only be broken.(snap locks)I hope I provided you with some valuable information.NOTE: Those who already knew all the above information, please don’t thrash me in the comment section.Thank you for reading.Edit 1:So, the benefits of HSRP as claimed by the government are:Anyone can get a HSRP by registering his/her vehicle with the nearest authorized RTO (Regional Transport Office).",196 followers,Arun R,13K,0,0,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-do-you-know-that-most-people-don%E2%80%99t

Plasticity, the brain's ability to reorganise itself by forming new connections is more powerful than we think.A great example of plasticity is the ability to learn a new language. The left hemisphere of the brain is responsible for language. A person who may have damage to this area may be unable to express or comprehend his words. In some circumstances, the right hemisphere may 'take over' the performance of language functions, despite this side being innately less successful.This right hemisphere ability may also be one explanation as to why it is possible to learn a new language after the critical period passes.The brain's pretty awesome right?Image Source:https://www.cbc.ca/amp/1.3679125More on language:The Right Hemisphere's Contribution to Language: A Review of the Evidence from Brain-Damaged Subjects",262 followers,Manikanta Kandagatla,8.9K,0,0,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-do-you-know-that-most-people-don%E2%80%99t

The Eiffel Tower's design is actually inspired by the biological structure of the femur (the human thigh bone). He was once researching the structure of the femur and realized that the connection, or the joint, between the femur and hip bone is made up of many minute fibre like material called the trabaculae, which are woven in a criss cross pattern. So basically, they involve a lot of air gaps in between them rather than the actual bone material.In layman's terms, there's material only where you need it to be, i.e, only where the forces are actually acting. Eiffel used this concept in designing the trusses (the X shaped components of structures) used in the tower which, if you look more closely, has a lot of holes.This significantly reduces the weight of the structure as you can leave the rest of the space empty.Here's the math for it (it's quite rudimentary, but it'll give you a rough picture):The weight of the tower is 7300 tonnes. Yes, the air which would be in the place of the tower has also been counted but still, there's a difference of over 2000 tonnes! And we're literally talking steel v/s air here.The femur bone is one of the many naturally nano engineered structures from which structural engineers derive inspiration. Imagine the amount of steel which appears to be used in the construction; that still weighs less than the air surrounding it. This particular branch of structural engineering is called biomimetics.Sources:",0 followers,Ashwini Bobade,6.1K,0,0,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-do-you-know-that-most-people-don%E2%80%99t

Officially, as an ECOWAS official, he could have been sent to a government hospital — but the government doctors were on strike because they had negotiation issues with the government at the time. Slumping at the airport in Lagos, Mr. Sawyer was taken to the private clinic where Dr. Adadevoh worked.The first doctor at the clinic who saw the man diagnosed him with malaria. In spite of the first malaria diagnosis, Dr. Adadevoh suspected Ebola when she saw him during her ward round the following day due to the fact that she, and no other doctor in Nigeria, had seen Ebola before then. A thorough clinician, she intuitively interrogated Mr. Sawyer about his worsening symptoms. He denied having contact with any Ebola carrier, but she insisted on reaching the Lagos State and Federal Ministries of Health so he gets tested for it.The patient and the other Liberian government personnel began to pressure the doctor to discharge him so he could go for the meeting. She refused to do so until the lab results were out. The man’s sister in Liberia had already died of the virus two weeks earlier. Knowing he was a possible carrier he still headed to Nigeria, insisting he only had a bad malaria.So the doctor suspected he was lying, especially when he started screaming to be released. At a time he had to be physically restrained after pulling off his drips, splashing blood around his room, urinating all over the place, and threatening to sue her for kidnapping and a violation of human rights (holding him against his will because she didn’t have a confirmed diagnosis). However, understanding his plan and its consequences, she stood her ground against the pressure.The then-health system had no protocols and equipment in place to deal with the situation, so Dr. Adadevoh had to manage the available resources in the hospital. Her Ebola diagnosis resulted in the government mobilizing the facilities to deal with an Ebola outbreak, inspiring a more strategic attention to the virus across the country. Fortunately, all the potential contacts from the first patient, a total of 20 cases, were traced. But unfortunately, 5 out of the 11 affected healthcare workers died, including Dr. Adadevoh.Dr. Adadevoh was neither a virologist nor a public-health expert. She was an Endocrinologist. Also, that was an unprecedented condition in the nation. To diagnose and manage and prevent its spread, she had to learn on the job, figure out a new treatment procedure, and calm panicking staff, while withstanding the threats from Mr. Sawyer.Her discernment, her tenacity and her ultimate sacrifice saved a country of over 190 million people from what would have been a phenomenal disaster — a virus with a 90% death rate. That enabled Nigeria to uproot the virus, and the World Health Organization declared Nigeria Ebola-free on October 20, 2014.Incidentally, Dr. Adadevoh was the first doctor in Nigeria to diagnose and alert the Ministry of Health of the Swine Flu in 2012, before she also became the first doctor to identify the deadlier Ebola virus.She became a gatekeeper for the nation. Sadly, as the health system at the time wasn’t prepared for such outbreak, she got the virus and died, survived by her husband, her only child, and the millions of Nigerians who will never forget her.","1,326 followers",Siddharth Govindarajan,5.9K,615,2M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-do-you-know-that-most-people-don%E2%80%99t

Your diaphragm is a dome-shaped muscle at the bottom of your chest. The diaphragm almost always works perfectly. When you inhale, it pulls down to help pull air into the lungs. When youI’ve literallyI’m going to let you in on myLet’s first understand what causes hiccups; only when we understand how a machine works can we fix it if it’s acting up. Your diaphragm is a dome-shaped muscle at the bottom of your chest. The diaphragm almost always works perfectly. When you inhale, it pulls down to help pull air into the lungs. When you exhale, the diaphragm relaxes and air flows out of the lungs back out through the nose and mouth.But sometimes the diaphragm becomes irritated. When this happens, it pulls down in a jerky way, which makes you suck air into your throat suddenly. When the air rushing in hits your voice box, your vocal cords close suddenly and you're left with a big hiccup.Some things that irritate the diaphragm are eating too quickly or too much, an irritation in the stomach or the throat, or feeling nervous or excited. Almost all cases of the hiccups last only a few minutes. Some cases of the hiccups can last for days or even months, but this is very unusual and it's usually a sign of another medical problem.So now that we understand the cause of hiccups, it’s fairly evident that to treat them, all we need to do is soothe the diaphragm, reduce the irritation and bring it back to a normal operating state.Fill a cup a little over half with water and hold the cup right side up. Stand and bend over, while placing your mouth on the opposite side of the cup so the opening is around your chin. Sip the water slowly, holding your breath as you do and breathing between sips. The combination of these forces your diaphragm to get back to its expected state of behavior.So the next time that cute girl you were trying to talk to has a bout of the hiccups, skip the cheesy lines telling her how “Sources:What Causes Hiccups?10 Possible Ways To Get Rid Of Hiccups FastIn case we haven’t met before, I’m","1,435 followers",Steve Ogbujah,6.3K,174,2.7M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-do-you-know-that-most-people-don%E2%80%99t

Taking bitter gourd actually worsens blood sugar (it is complex carbohydrate).60 % of serum cholesterol is synthesized in the Liver.

Other than that private medical store owners discourage people from buying medicines from Jan Aushadi, while we all know that the same ingredients in any medicine have same action even if they belong to different companies.But this fact is not realized by common people and they depend upon private medical stores.For the people who are doubtful about this, please go through the following link:http://janaushadhi.gov.in/Up vote, if my answer is useful for anyone.Edit 1: After writing this answer some are criticizing me by saying that if pharma companies charge more than normal price it is due to the quality of medicine and it is necessary for sustaining their business. Let me inform you that this answer is not for people earning 60 or 70 thousand in a month. This is for people who are not capable and don't have money for buying even an inhaler or vitamin tablets in day to day life.I personally witnessed an old couple struggling with poverty and diseases like breast cancer and dislocation of knee, they don't have home and their monthly income is only 1500 rupees including pension for cancer patients.They are illiterate and their economic condition is pathetic, now their cancer pension is also going to end by this month. (I personally did the official work for getting it but it can't be continued since the lady is not able to go to hospital for obtaining medical certificate). I contacted around 20–30 trusts and NGOs for any financial assistance but none helped.So my answer is for these kind of common people who are facing the darker side of life and wishing to die since they don't have expenditure for treatment.Edit 2:Please go through this video…Edit 3:","10,677 followers",Katyayani Misra,815,1.4K,42.3M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-do-you-know-that-most-people-don%E2%80%99t

It's dirty, glass windows are shattered, bathrooms are unhygienic and so on. We, the residents of this hostel, drink, smoke, don't bath frequently, use abusive language and most other things that you might think about us are generally true.There's a bitch(female dog, not abusing anyone) who lives near our hostel. We call her “Bhoori"" meaning brown as her colour is brown. She usually feeds on our left overs. When we arrived at our hostel in early February, we saw that she had given birth to three pups. Boys used to play with them.We had classes from 10:00 am to 1:00 pm that day. When we came back to our hostel at around 01:15 pm and we saw her lying in front of our hostel gate. When we got closer we noticed that she was crying. We couldn't understand why. We thought she might be hungry and so we brought food and water for her but she didn't take any of that and kept crying. One of us noticed that milk was coming out of her nipples. We understood why she is crying. We looked for those three pups all around our hostel but couldn't find them. Then we asked the ward boy of our hostel and he told us that the sweeper has taken them and he threw them away because he had to clean their shit. We were furious, is this humanity? But we decided to do something for her. Three of us asked the ward boy where the sweeper threw them. Then they decided to go there to bring those pups back. They were in uniform, they had classes but they skipped their classes and went to bring those pups back to their mother. Unfortunately, they could only find two of those pups. We looked for that one missing pup everywhere but could not find it. This is she ( Bhoori) when she found her two pups:The next day everyone was fighting with that sweeper for throwing away the pups. Boys warned him not to throw these pups away again.These boys, who are assumed to be heartless, they did this for just an animal who isn't even their pet. And on the other side an adult is being so inhuman. These adults who judge us and tag us with being ignorant, heartless, etc. I am so proud of us for taking so good care of those pups.

Peace out.EDIT 1 - DIVISION OF 0/0 (Indeterminable)Yes 0/0 could be explained by the definition , you will get many answer not only 1 , you can subtract 0 from 0 as many times as you want to get 0, let's say 1 time 2 times 3 times and so on thus all number satisfies that's why 0/0 is indeterminable .You can also cross check If a/b =c then then a=bc so if 0/0=c then 0=0*c is satisfied for all values of c and that's exactly what the definition says all number .So by convention we say it is indeterminable.",0 followers,Anand Mishra,2.5K,80,315.7K,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-do-you-know-that-most-people-don%E2%80%99t

Einstein's greatest mistake :In 1917, Albert Einstein [ https://amp.space.com/8279-einstein-rules-universe.html ] inserted a term called the cosmological constant into his theory of general relativity to force the equations to predict a stationary universe in keeping with physicists' thinking at the time. When it became clear that the universe wasn't actually static, but was expanding instead, Einstein abandoned the constant, calling it the '""biggest blunder"" of his life.3. Weird outcomes of double slit experiment :This is experiment gave the weirdest results supporting quantum physics theory which says that “When a quantum ""observer"" is watching Quantum mechanics states that particles can also behave as waves. ... In other words, when under observation, electrons are being ""forced"" to behave like particles and not like waves. Thus the mere act of observation affects the experimental findings.”If you are interested in the double slit experiment, I would recommend you to Google about this for more information.4.

Sometimes, I believe in what I experience, not rely on scientific facts that may be written even a way before my birth.😅 I don't find many favts reliable in actual life, those are just proved in ideally condition.Rest it's upon you guys….I have cleared your thoughts.Edit:2Many of you guys are having doubts on this remedy. There are many websites who have published articles related to it and claimed it to be harmful for health.I wanna counter some facts and wanna let you everyone know about the real scenario.The articles which talk about this remedy generally focuses on its elements separately. And those facts are too presented in distorted manner.The mixture contain just very small amount of each element, which is harmless. The pouch made is very little and just you have to inhale whenever you feel dizzy.I have personally used and by my family members, only after then I have shared it here. If your body feels irritation you can leave it, everyone's body reacts different to same thing.You don't have to tie it with your nose. Just use for a quite few time. Most importantly, its a home remedy not a doctor's prescribed one. It's a precautionary measure, a homemade remedy for ones with low risk issues. It cannot be replaced by oxygen cylinder 😅. It's a common sense, it's not a oxygen generator. You should obey what doctors prescribe ones you are admitted to hospital, If condition is literally serious. No one should take it lightly, life is precious. Think wisely, before doing something.My post has just for the ones who are actually at home and not much serious and doesn't matter if one is Covid-19 or not. The items listed in that has sufficient Ayurvedic advantages. But people are actually doing wrong and connecting wrong dots. Relating it to Covid-19 is ridiculous.The post circulating over the social media is somewhat misleading as it claims to counter Covid-19 but in reality it has nothing to do with it. Some people are seen preferring this remedy while in hospital which is actually wrong and making the buzz in media.I would like to clearly say, don't fell in prey for someone's foolish post. Think twice messing up with your health, it's actually precious.I edited this post as am getting a good response from readers and I appreciate all of them.Hope Some more queries have been solved now.",11 followers,Alistair Wood,1.7K,84,676.9K,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-do-you-know-that-most-people-don%E2%80%99t

Since that’s too good to be true, this actually means there is shortage of engine oil or there is a problem with the oil pressure system.3.This may appear for a variety of reasons. Either the catalytic converter or the oxygen sensor needs to be replaced. It may also mean your spark plugs are damaged or there is an issue with your gas cap. The Mass airflow sensor may also need replacing. In short, go see the mechanic, don’t be a miser.4.The anti-lock braking system of your car needs to be fixed or you may not die of natural causes.5.Similar to a Lego brick, this signifies total dependency of the car on battery, that is the car’s charging system is short of power.6.This means you may not reach your intended destination as you may run out of fuel.7.The car has a washing fluid in case you didn’t know. Please refill that.8.Don’t wait for your car to say that. Put your seatbelt on.9.This is the airbag indicator, meaning there is an issue with the car’s airbag(s). Get it fixed or else you won’t die of natural causes again.10.Nothing related to dying. Just that the fog lamps of your car are on.11.Either there is a problem with your car’s anti theft system, or you need a key with a proper transponder to start your car. This is known as security light.12.The traction control of your car is malfunctioning. Your car may not get enough traction and may skid off the road. No kidding. Only Skidding.13.Hit the brake to get the car out of neutral or to start the car.14.Traction control system is on. Traction control prevents skidding. So this is sort of opposite to point number 12.15.Well, this is a tyre pressure indicator trying to convey the message of low pressure in one or more tyres.16.Handbrake (also called parking brake) of your car is engaged. Disengage it to drive. Any other malfunction with the brake system also causes this light to glow, eg: low brake oil.17.The glow plug indicator (comes with most diesel cars). This will either stay or blink if there is a fault. Usually you can drive but it's not recommended. In some cars if the indicator glows, the car won't even start.Consider this a public service announcement.Edit 1:Based on the colour of the symbol, you can know the severity.Red means it is an alert and needs immediate driver attention. It cannot be ignored by the driver as the sound never goes off.Yellow means it is a warning message and the driver can ignore that and anyway it gets recorded in the diagnostic messages for further reference.White means it is a info message and usually it does not have a hardware issue, just software issues.Edit 2:Edit 3:",228 followers,Ishan Singh,1.5K,0,0,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-do-you-know-that-most-people-don%E2%80%99t

These sheets then travel under a mechanism containing “docker” pins that end up putting the holes in the dough. The hole’s positioning and number varies depending on the size and shape of the cracker.If the holes are too close together, the cracker will end up being extra dry and hard, due to too much steam escaping.If the holes end up being too far apart, parts of the cracker will rise a bit forming little bubbles on the surface of the cracker, which is undesirable in most types of crackers.I think now you are answerable to kids who ask this silly question to you…Cheers :)",726 followers,Tejaswini Tapse,1.2K,0,0,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-do-you-know-that-most-people-don%E2%80%99t

A classical cautionary tale.Just 13 miles long and 7 miles wide. People first arrived on the Island less than 1000 years ago. Most about what we know about their civilisation can only be pieced together from the relics that remain.It is a strange and desolate place.The most striking features in this bleak and wind swept landscape are the hundreds of giant stone statues. Known as the moai. Thought to be carved in the likeness of chiefs or ancestors.Its difficult to believe that an advanced culture capable of carving and erecting these monoliths, grew up in such a barren landscape.The truth is, it didn't.When those first colonisers discovered Easter Island, it was a paradise.Easter Island is adorned with empty cliffs facing the sea, which were once home to the largest sea birds colonies in the south pacific.Rich volcanic soil nurtured a forest of giant palms that was home to many unique species including Easter Island's versions of herons, parrots, owls etc.Today they're all gone.The people ultimately didn't fare much better. The rise and fall of Easter Island's people, the Rapa Nui is now legendary.A quarry in the island once occupied the majority of the island's workforce, thousands of people. With each clan trying to carve and raise a bigger moai than those of their neighbours. Vast amounts of timber would be required to transport and erect the giant moai and slowly but surely the forest vanished.Eventually, there was no wood left even to build boats. Without fishing boats they would've been denied their main source of food and their one means of escape.As resources dwindled the Easter Island society descended into chaos and warfare. The giants statues were pulled to the ground, possibly acts of sabotage between rival clans.Houses were abandoned and foundations stones used to construct fortified dwellings in caves underground. Some evidence even suggest that once everything consumable had been consumed, the starving were driven to that most desperate of acts, cannibalism.Understandably, this version of Easter Island's history draws some controversy, because it suggests the Rapa Nuis were incredibly short sighted. As the trees dwindled why didn't they do anything about it?But a new theory suggests, the Rapa Nui were powerless to prevent their downfall. For when they arrived on this island they were not alone.Rats travelled with people everywhere they sailed to. On Easter Island, they might have been catastrophic, multiplying to plagues proportions, they would have devoured the wild fruits, the seabirds, even the nuts of the giant palms. So the trees may have stopped reproducing long before the last one was felled.Perhaps, the fate of Easter Island was not sealed by the human who fell the last tree but by the rat who ate the last palm nut.Civilisations have arisen and fallen along the Pacific islands, though maybe none has left such dramatic reminders of their passing as the giants statues of the Rapa Nui.Now re erected, the statues have come to symbolise how precarious life can be on an isolated island. A few Rapa Nui survived and now entertain visitors from across the world on the island.Trees have been planted, though it's too late for the unique biodiversity that once lived on the island.Now dear reader, there is a valuable lesson in this tale.

Her best friends are of different religions.- Personally, I like the spiritual feeling I get in temples, it's too much similar to the peace I get in a mosque, only I just don't know how to pray in a temple.- Being a Muslim, I have met many Muslims. Not even one - yes not even one spoke anything against country or Hindus. But when I read stuffs on internet, people potray things in a way which is so much fake.- I love my country. I am proud of it's heritage and the army. I do not get it when I am called a terrorist just for being a Muslim. It hurts me as well when a soldier is martyred on border. I don't care what religion he belongs to.- It's okay to support Pakistan in cricket. It's okay to like their singers, artists and actors. Liking a team or an artist does not mean I want to go to Pakistan or I am anti-national.- It hurts like hell when our politicians give statements that certifies Muslims as outsiders/villains/peacebreakers.- I am tired of hearing the statement that all Muslims are not terrorists. In our country, more lives are lost becuase of political parties who are fake flag bearers of Hindu religion. Hinduism is not what BJP and RSS potrays. It's an extremely colorful part of our culture, Bhagwat Geeta talks about peace. So does Quran. So does Bible or any other holy book. I apologize in advance if someone is offended by this particular point.- Jihad is highly misinterpreted term. It's for saving your family, your friends. It's not to kill innocents.- People who blast bombs saying Allah-ho-akbar and people who kill saying Hey Ram are truly not in correct mental status.- As a Muslim, I am not allowed to pray to any other god but Allah. But that does not mean I hate or disapprove others.I have faced severe discrimination all my life, in school people used to call me Osama. There were a couple of girls whom I fell in love with, they rejected me because they thought I am doing love jihad. My 3 year old child when plays in our society, some kids call him a terrorist or shaitan, they are kids, they don't know religion, it's the parents who are mentally sick and passing on this sickness to future generations.All I request from whoever reads this, plese stop this hatred. We are born here and we belong here. We don't want to take away what is yours, please don't get influenced by politicians who feed on hatred. Enough of this dirt of generations till now, let's step into future with clean heart and peaceful mind. We love you all, and all that we want in return is acceptance. It's not going to be easy to gel two different cultures, we all have to step down few steps to reach to a common ground. People who post comments full of hatred against Muslims and Hindus, stop it. It's dragging our country to stone age at a time when we should only focus on future.EDIT 1:Some people claim this is fake story to seek sympathy.Why would I be anonymous if I want sympathy?Anyway, it’s understandable for people to not believe it since it’s too much I guess.I just wrote with a hope that atleast a few people will realise that whatever they have heard so far is not true about Indian Muslims. I did not intend sympathy of any kind.EDIT 2:- I request people to pick the peaceful points from the above, not sure why some poeple are ignoring the positive things and stressing more on this being a fake story. Well, this is 100% true. Infact, it's just a bit of the whole picture.- Some people mentioned about Azaan. I do not deny that it's not disturbing people. Personally, if this is what takes to make people accept us, I am ready and willing to stop it right away if only it were about me. But the elders, my mother, my father, my grandparents, they would not be happy about it. It's a path they have beel following since ages. And azaan is called for only in masjids, not within any society. For instance, consider someone telling a Hindu to stop doing aarti or ring bells in mandir. Probably the younger generation would be okay with it to make peace, but the elders are not so easy to convince. Again, before someone misinterprets this sentence and finds an excuse to abuse me, I apologise for using example of aarti, I just wrote it to try and explain the situation. Just FYI - I have gone to temples many times and rung the bell, it's feels good and I have no issues about it.- Some people are angry because I mentioned about Pakistani cricket team. They assumed by default that the match is against India which I never said, when India won world cup, we all went out on streets and shouted India..India! Remember?People it's a sport! I did not mention that during a war we support Pakistani soldiers. We never do that. We hate Pakistan for killing our soldiers and crossing their border. Ever seen someone blasting crackers when an Indian soldier is dead? No, and you will never see that. There might be a couple of mentally sick people but I do not count them as Muslims or humans anyway.- One comment even mentioned that Muslims were supposed to go to Pakistan, they live here on the mercy of Hindus. You are right, we do live on mercy of Hindus who try their best to treat us as equal, as brothers. If these Hindus were not present in our country, than Muslims would be treated much worse by the tiny bit of people who hate us so much. I dream of a country where we reduce the hatred to the minimum extent as possible.- A comment said why dont you marry Muslim women only. My friend, look around, 80-90% people in college are Hindus. I fell in love not by looking at someone's religion, her beauty, her kindness, her attitude and her humor made me fall for her. If a person first checks for religion and then decides to love the girl, it's a calculation. Forget religion, consider this example, you join an IT firm where there are 10 girls. 2 of them work on Java, and 8 work on .NET. Since you are a Java programmer, will your heart necessarily love the Java programmer? It's not coding, we are not robots.Finally, if possible, stop spreading hatred. I know the two cultures are pole apart, but end of the day we all are humans. We all respect our elders, feel love for our newborn, want to take care of our families. As i have mentioned before, there are things we dislike about each other's cultures and we'll continue to dislike them. We need to grow beyond that. My best friends mother does not drink water at my house because we cook non-veg and she is strict Hindu. But that does not mean she does not visit my house. We specially order food for her or cook in a completely new utensils. When my friend is visiting a temple, I do not disrespect by entering with shoes, I show utmost respect even though I do not pray to the god, I still bend down and ring the bell in temple.Again, before ending this edit, I just want to apologize again to anyone who found anything offensive. The intent for this post was just to spread love and eliminate hatred. Even if a single person feels the need to grow beyond differences and live together as brothers, I would feel my every word did count!

Earlier they used to worship Ravana at their house but in 2008, a temple was constructed and the statue of Ravana invoking Lord Shiva was installed.The statue is six and a half feet tall and made out of Jodhpur sandstone. Since then, the descendents of Ravana worship him every day at this temple. They remember and celebrate Ravana as the great King of Lanka who was blessed by Lord Shiva and considered as one of the greatest scholars of his time.So when entire India celebrates Dussehra by burning the effigy of Ravana, the people of Mandore stay at home and mourn his death. In fact for last hundreds of years, these people have been performing Ravana’s shradh.This legend associated with Mandore makes it a must visit place.

England's Air force retaliated and was more successful in terms of number of kills made in the dark.The reason British ministry of Information stated for its immense success was -They stated that their pilots were made to eat sufficient amount of carrots, which drastically improved their vision and helped them to see the enemy aircraft beforehand and attack them in the dark.To make their story more believable, the British Ministry started a campaign that encouraged civilians to do all they could to support the war, and that meant growing their own food, including carrots. Several carrot recipes were handed out across England to help people make the most of their carrot supplies. So it would seem logical that eating all these carrots could be helping the pilots who were flying in defense of the country to spot the enemy sooner.The carrot story was just a cover for what the British pilots were really using -It is not known/proven if the Germans took the bait, but what is known is - the Englishmen did.The British government had issued orders for city-wide blackouts to prevent the German bombers from easily targeting important places and buildings. So it wasn’t just the pilots that needed a way to see in the dark, it was civilians, too—and carrots were going to give it to them.And that gave birth to this fact (Myth?) that carrots improve night vision - which is still a widely accepted belief, decades after the conclusion of the war.Sources : A very good friend’s knowledge base and,A WWII Propaganda Campaign Popularized the Myth That Carrots Help You See in the DarkCarrots Won't Improve Your Night Vision, But They Will Fool The Nazis - KnowledgeNuts",121 followers,Ashyia Khanam,1K,0,0,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-do-you-know-that-most-people-don%E2%80%99t

Chances are, it won’t.But what if I tell you that the government can choose to relocate the site and go ahead with constructing the dam? Unbelievable, right?This is what exactly happened withTemple Abu SimbelImage source: Travel AddictsOut of solid rock on the side of a hill, the temples of Abu Simbel were built more than 3,000 years ago, to honor Pharaoh Rameses II and his queen Nefertari. They were originally located at the second cataract of the Nile river, where they were left undisturbed until 1950s.The mid-20th century Egyptian government under General Nasser planned to construct Aswan Dam to control the unpredictable annual Nile floods and provide hydroelectric power. But such a dam would well and truly place Abu Simbel underwater.Recognizing the issue, the Egyptian and Sudanese government, in 1959, wrote to UNESCO seeking their assistance in saving the temples. Thus began this unprecedented move that revolutionized the international approach to safeguarding heritage.The plan was to move the monuments completely away from the river — 65 meters higher and 200 meters back — onto an artificial hill. Inside the hill, a concrete dome would house the interior of the temple.The delicate work began in 1964. Using tools ranging from handsaws to bulldozers, the statues and the temples were carved into 20-ton blocks which were put back together on the new site.Image source: Getty ImagesImage source: Getty ImagesImage source: Getty ImagesImage source: Getty ImagesThe reassembly called for extreme precision, with a tiny tolerance of only plus or minus 5 millimeters.

When the Sun is at the horizon, the radiation that comes to you has to go through the maximum of the atmosphere (compared to when it’s over your head).Now, if the blue region of visible light isn’t able to reach you and ultraviolet rays have a wavelength way smaller than visible light, then how would the ultraviolet region of light even dare to touch you in the morning?So, if you want Vitamin D, it’s better to go for the sunlight during the noontime.But hey… if ultraviolet rays are good for you, it doesn’t mean that you will start causing air pollution to deplete the ozone layer for more ultraviolet rays to enter the atmosphere.Sunny Dhondkar",78 followers,Jitesh Sarda,887,0,0,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-do-you-know-that-most-people-don%E2%80%99t

But rest of Indians should definitely know this fact.RAJENDRA CHOLAN IS INDIA’S GREATEST KING.CHOLA DYNASTY IS THE MOST GLORIOUS DYNASTY OF INDIA.It may be hard for many people to accept this fact, especially some North Indians, but let us see it with facts.List of achievements of Cholan Kings:People of Tamil Nadu may be aware of what I am going to write. But rest of Indians should definitely know this fact.RAJENDRA CHOLAN IS INDIA’S GREATEST KING.CHOLA DYNASTY IS THE MOST GLORIOUS DYNASTY OF INDIA.It may be hard for many people to accept this fact, especially some North Indians, but let us see it with facts.List of achievements of Cholan Kings:Their Temples are very much alive today & many of them are more than one thousand years old.Way back then they knew it clearly that if humans are removed from this world the only structures that would remain intact are those made of stone.Thats exactly why they built their Temples with Granite.The achievement of this dynasty is endless & continues to live today.I have my respects to every other dynasty, Kings & rulers of this soil but no one has accomplished so much in their lifetime equivalent to that of the Cholan Kings.The Cholan Kings are the only Kings in the whole world who put their GOD above themselves. All luxury and glory was for their GOD and their personal luxury always took a back seat.Glory to their GOD meant glorious Temples & huge Temples always belonged to the general public & not to the dynasty.What a big heart they had way back then?Thats why you can find magnificent Chola Temples but you cannot find their Palaces. In fact they always lived a modest personal life.Let alone North Indians, the sad part is even Tamils living in TN dont realize their value unless otherwise told.Cholan astrologers knew very well that many years later India would go into an age of darkness and that could not be avoided.And it was for this reason that made them be magnificent in their work. Maybe if after a thousand years if our people are in darkness, then by looking at our Temples they must realize who they were. It must strike them in their DNA & remind them of what they are capable of by just looking at their mighty Temples.Raja Raja Cholan built the Tanjore Big Temple magnificently for this one reason.It would always act as a guiding Northern Star for his people even after thousands of years later when they are lost and when there is no one to guide them.Every Indian should be Proud of the Cholan Dynasty.When they undertook great engineering feats, present day USA was not discovered, Europe was barbaric where one person was eating others persons meat.Today it is just the opposite, they have everything and we are admiring them.Hope we all Indians learn from the Cholan Dynasty & rise back to glory again.Long Live Tamil. Long Live India.Humble Request to all Indians:Please stop telling that India never invaded any country for the past 10,000 years, India is a peace loving country and all kind of such infactual happenings.There was Rajendra Cholan. His spirit continues to live on.Edit 1Thats why it is said as INDIANS we are strong together though we have different languages.

That 0.25 day becomes a whole day after 4 years (0.25*4=1). We have been taught only this much in our schools. It is not the complete truth.Our earth takes 365.24 days (not 365.25) to complete a revolution around the sun. We add an extra day every 4 years.But by doing so, we are going ahead in time, as 0.24 day will become 0.96 day in 4 years, and not a complete day.0.96 day means 23.04 hours (0.96*24). So, technically we are going ahead by 24–23.04= 0.96 hours every 4 years. So, to correct this error, we decided to not keep century year as a leap year, because in 100 years, there are 25 leap years, that means 0.96*25=24 hours is deducted from the calendar to correct this error.But, a century year which is divisible by 400 is a leap year.So, 2000 was a leap year, 2100, 2200, 2300 will not be leap years. 2400 will be a leap year.Hope you liked it.ThanksEdit 1:Many people have asked me why century year divisible by 400 will be a leap year. I am really sorry for this, but I dont remember the reason for it. I was taught this when I was preparing for my college entrance exams (in logical reasoning). I was taught to find the day if a particular date was given. Now, due to lack of practice, I have forgotten most of the things, but this leap year thing seemed very interesting to me, so I remembered it.And as you know now, the source of this information is my tuition teacher. I didn't copy it from the internet.

Sometimes called “the Nirvana color,” blue symbolizes the comfort, sky, water, sleep, the mind, trustworthiness and safety (think Police Officer uniforms). Most importantly, blue represents communication – which makes sense in regards to websites designed for communication.Blue promotes interaction. Most other colors tend to distract the consumer, whereas the color blue disappears as a transparent background.Thank you :)",78 followers,Vaibhav Gala,767,0,0,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-do-you-know-that-most-people-don%E2%80%99t

On the afternoon of April 15, thousands had gathered at Motihari railway station (in Bihar’s East Champaran) to wait for a man who was destined to lift their lives out of misery.It was 3 pm when Gandhi alighted at the station from a train coming from Muzaffarpur. He had come to probe the appalling conditions under which local farmers were being forced by the landlords to grow indigo.Nobody knew it then but this fact-finding mission would snowball into the firstAccording to the bookSo Erwin told his cook, Batak Mian, to serve Gandhi a glass of milk laced with poison. To ensure that this was done, he offered substantial inducements as well as issued threats of dire punishment.When the time came, the deeply patriotic cook did present the glass of milk to Gandhi, but also warned him of its contents and revealed Erwin’s sinister intentions behind it. Dr Rajendra Prasad, who would later go on to become India’s first president, witnessed the entire episode.While Gandhi escaped the assassination attempt to successfully lead the Champaran Satyagraha, the man who had saved his life had to pay dearly for it. Dismissed from work, Batak Mian was thrown behind bars and tortured. His house was turned into a crematorium and his family was driven out of their village (Siswa Ajgari, a hamlet near Motihari).With time, his act of bravery was erased from public memory, until 1950, when Dr Rajendra Prasad visited Motihari ( the then-headquarters of an undivided Champaran). As India’s first president alighted at the railway station, he was greeted by a huge crowd that had gathered to welcome him.Below is the image when gandhiji came in chamaparanSo just think “If it weren’t for Batak Mian, India’s history would have been different.”One small Thanks to this gentleman guysSource :",2 followers,Achirman Roy,765,0,0,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-do-you-know-that-most-people-don%E2%80%99t

This is why her side of the story is written in such vivid detail while Rama’s side of the story sounds more like a hearsay account. It is pretty obvious that Rama would have narrated his side of the story to his wife after they were united. But there is no divine vision or collection of several narratives from all over the place here like how the Mahabharata was written. It is exclusively from her PoV.This is why we don’t know what exactly happened when Rama went into the forest chasing the golden deer. Or what Lakshmana found when he ran after him. It’s all there in the story, but as a hearsay narrative. It is pretty evident that it is not the person who underwent it who has narrated it. The difference is pretty glaring in the way Rama’s side of the story is narrated and in how much detail Sita’s stay at Ashoka Vatika is narrated. The garden was sealed off. And only she could have given such a detailed account of what she underwent.This makes one wonder how much more rich the epic would have been if several narratives were combined, layered and then written down.

What many people don’t know is about the people behind these brave men, who fought equally for our motherland, for the dream of Netaji and for themselves.One of those shadow people being ‘Basant’, the wife of Gurubux Singh Dhillon.When her husband was fighting beside Netaji, she lead an army of women during the 1942 Lahore revolt in Anarkali Bazar. She was captured and imprisoned. She didn't shed a single drop of tear thinking what she did was just contributing a little drop in the ocean which Netaji dreamt of creating.When she came to meet her husband before the trials, both of them were extremely proud of each other. Gurubux had one request for his wife that he desired her presence, when he would be hanged.The brave lady then replied, “Don't worry! The motherland, the leader, the dream, the golden future of independent India, for which you are going to the gallows and wearing the noose, not just once, if you are hanged even ten times in front of me, I shall wish you adieu with a smile in my face and pride in my eyes!”Such was the bravery of these Indian ladies.

He passes his hand over the plant, and flowers come out.

The young man was bought to the death row. As soon as he was hung; Moti lal Nehru sent men to hold on to his leg and rescue him. When this was taken to court; Moti lal Nehru pleaded not guilty.His argument was about the verdict. The magistrate wrote the death sentence as “Hang him”. And the sentence was executed.

I called him that whether he has milk, any sort of even half litre would be sufficient but he didn’t replied a single word. I asked several times, there was noise from inside of things putting here and there but he was pin drop silent. I waited for 5 minutes.Suddenly i saw the board over me which has timings 4 pm toAs he was not replying, i went home disappointed. Now to tell you all, this is not a problem of 10 minutes, but it’s his attitude problem, he always do such kind of things, he considers himself to be king of monopolistic market.Now, i just thought of complaining about him, so I went to the site of mother dairy and written all in their complaint box. However, it was just to back me that i did something, because i knew that nothing is going to happen considering it’s just about 10 minutes issue.To my surprise, I got a call the next day at 11 a.m. approx. from a person asking me the details of the problem i faced, and he told me that he is going to booth to meet the person and take the action.I then told him that he does not need to take any action but just to tell that person to change his attitude towards people a bit.

When she eventually arrived, her husband was furious to know of her adulterous thoughts by means of his meditative power and ordered his sons to kill their Mother.The sons weren't sure what to do. In Vedic culture, murdering any woman is a horrible sin. On the other hand, disobeying an elder's command (especially the father's) is also a great offense. When the sage's confused elder sons declined to obey his command, the sage instructed his youngest son, Parashuram, to kill his disloyal Mother and disobedient brothers.Parashuram, knowing the power of his father, thought that if he refused to carry out his father’s order he would be cursed, but if he carried out the order, his father would be pleased and would give him a benediction. he would then be able to bring his Mother and brothers back to life with that benediction. Parashuram therefore killed his own Mother and brothers. When Jamadagni, Parashuram's father being very pleased, offered to give him a benediction, Parashuram requested that his Mother and brothers be brought back to life and that they would not remember having been killed by himSmile!Image sourceSource",56 followers,Gayathri Sampath,653,0,0,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-do-you-know-that-most-people-don%E2%80%99t

They had to take a long sea route, all the way around Africa which often used to last as long as 6 months. Note that the Suez Canal had not been dug at that time. Selling spices and other commodities from India in Europe brought in lots of wealth for them, and was worth this harsh journey.But there was a problem: most of their food supplies, especially citrus fruits, would get rotten by the time they completed their voyage, and several of the crew members used to get sick and even die of scurvy during this time.Human beings’ inability to naturally produce vitamin C, and having to get it from external sources, is due to a mutation in our genes that disabled an enzyme named GULO which is responsible for this. Most other animals, excluding us and some other closely related primates, do not need an external supply of Vitamin C and hence do not suffer from scurvy.Now, to deal with this problem, the Dutch started sending their farmers in large numbers to be settled in and around Cape of Good Hope (which is now known as Cape Town) in South Africa. They were given the task to farm fresh fruits, and passing Dutch ships would stop and replenish their supplies, thus keeping their crew free of scurvy.By the end of the 17th century, the Dutch East India Company had long been disbanded and the large number of descendants of these farmers had moved on with their lives and no longer served as suppliers for the passing ships.

Your Feet Can Grow as You AgeAfter years of wear and tear, tendons and ligaments in your feet may weaken. This can cause arches to flatten, which means feet get wider and longer. It won’t happen to everyone, though-people who are overweight, who get swollen feet or ankles, or who have certain medical conditions, like diabetes, are more prone. If it does happen, the average gain is about one shoe size by age 70 or 80.–Cary M. Zinkin, DPM, podiatric sports physician(Photo: Creatas/Jupiterimages/Thinkstock)2 / 132. Motion Sickness is Caused by Your Insides Actually ShiftingWhen a roller coaster comes over its crest, slows for a second for added torture, and then plummets downward, the seat belt keeps your rear in place, but some loosely connected internal organs-like your stomach and intestines-get a little “air time.” You’re not damaging your innards by riding even the craziest of coasters (everything returns to its proper place), but your nerves detect the movement, which registers as though your stomach has jumped into your throat.-Maged Rizk, MD, gastroenterologist(Photo: iStockphoto/Thinkstock)3 / 133. Women Handle the Cold Worse than MenThe fairer sex has a higher percentage of body fat and conserves more heat around the core. That helps keep vital organs nice and toasty but not the extremities-and when your hands and feet feel cold, so does the rest of your body. Plus, research suggests that women have a lower threshold for cold than men. When exposed to the same freezing temperature, the blood vessels in women’s fingers constrict more than men’s do, which is why they turn white more quickly.-Kathryn Sandberg, director of the Center for the Study of Sex Differences in Health, Aging and Disease at Georgetown University(Photo: iStockphoto/Thinkstock)4 / 134. “Old-person Smell” is RealBut there’s also a distinctive middle-aged-person smell and a young-person smell, according to a recent study. The research found that older people have a less intense-and more pleasant-scent than the middle-aged folk and young whippersnappers. Not what you expected, right?–PLoS ONE [ http://www.plosone.org/ ](Photo: Digital Vision/Thinkstock)5 / 135. Your Senses Hate Room Temperature CoffeeTemperature affects flavour. Researchers in Belgium found that certain taste bud receptors are most sensitive to food molecules that are at or just above room temperature. So hot coffee may seem less bitter (and, in turn, taste better) because our bitter-detecting taste buds aren’t as sensitive when coffee is hot. Odours influence flavour as well, so even the most bitter hot coffee may taste delicious because of its pleasant aroma; room-temperature coffee doesn’t smell the same.-Paul Breslin, PhD, professor of nutritional sciences(Photo: iStockphoto/Thinkstock)6 / 136. You Can Urinate at Night, but That’s Usually ItThe sophisticated, intelligent neurons in your gut that control colon contractions, which push out waste, are also influenced by your body’s circadian rhythm, the internal clock that wakes you when it’s light out and makes you feel sleepy at night. So most people don’t have the urge to empty their colon in the middle of the night.On the other hand, the bladder, which acts a reservoir for the continuous flow of urine produced in the kidneys, can stretch only up to a certain volume before you gotta go. Normally, you can sleep six to eight hours without having to urinate, but certain medical conditions or drinking too much water before bed can wake you to use the bathroom at night.-Pankaj J. Pasricha, MD, director of neurogastroenterology at the Johns Hopkins Center for Neurogastroenterology(Photo: iStockphoto/Thinkstock)7 / 137. Fingerprints Don’t Actually Improve Your GripMany experts think we have fingerprints to improve grip, but a British study from a few years back suggests otherwise. Researchers found that a fingerprint’s ridges actually made it harder to hold flat, smooth surfaces, like Plexiglas, because they reduced the skin’s contact area. Instead, they think our prints might help wick water off our fingertips or allow our skin to stretch more easily, which can protect it from damage and help prevent blisters. Other scientists have suggested fingerprints could improve our sense of touch.-V. Patteson Lombardi, PhD, research assistant professor of biology(Photo: iStockphoto/Thinkstock)8 / 138. Achy Joints May be Able to Forecast the WeatherA change in barometric readings may be part of the reason: Atmospheric pressure often drops right before bad weather sets in; this shift could cause body tissue to expand, which can lead to swelling and pain.

One person can make the differenceIn 2015, Nana Patekar along with his friend Makarand Anaspure established an organization named2. Showing off is easy, but being true to yourself is hard.Nana Patekar was born to a lower middle class family, he has faced struggles, but it’s his hard work and commitment that he has become one of the talented and successful actors of the industry. When he wasn’t famous or successful, he earned for his survival through drawing zebra crossing lines on the busy Mumbai roads. Nana doesn’t believe in material possessions, he donates almost all his earnings to charity. He is a man of simplicity and humble lifestyle, he dresses simple, lives with his mother in a 1 BHK flat in Mumbai Suburbs. He is truly an inspiration for the youth.3. Humanity is more important than any religion.Nana is a straight forward person, he doesn’t mince his words, he speaks what’s on his mind and means what he says. Speaking once at a school function in Sindhudurga district, he said, “We all are Indians and that should be our only religion. What is the need to be called a Hindu, Muslim or Christian? Does anybody have any religion or caste at the time of birth?”. He reminded us that every religion ultimately preaches that god lies inside us, look for god in a human being. We all have a hero and a villain inside us, it comes down to us to make the choice. If we choose humanity, it will give us the satisfaction and peace. Nana Patekar was served the Indian army during the Kargil war and was honoured with the title of ‘Captain’4. Money can make a difference, but don’t let it make you differentThere was a time when Nana Patekar couldn’t even afford an auto rickshaw ride. And now with his success and fame, he can ride in luxurious cars, but he still prefers travelling in an auto-rickshaw. He’s an actor in front of the camera, but deep down he’s still the same simple ordinary person. He says that stardom is temporary, it will fade away one day and when it does, it will be difficult to deal life without it. So one must never forget where they came from, one must always remember their roots as they are a permanent part of your lifeSource-” Google”",102 followers,Ayub Raza,505,0,0,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-do-you-know-that-most-people-don%E2%80%99t

Have you seen child whose spinal cord is coming out from back?See thisand thisImage Source:The child would be having symptoms of urinary incontinence, muscular weakness, leaking of stool etc, which make the parent’s life hard too.These are not rare diseases. Number of Babies being born with such conditions are quite high in India which made me write this answer.Neural tube defectsIt means that these patients have defective development of brain. Imagine fate of people with 10–20% brain tissue.Imagine the state of mother who takes care of her child for 9 months in the womb and when the baby comes out he bears such defects. Most of such babies succumb to death very early.Hack to prevent birth of child with such anomaliesTo prevent these defects, all you (pregnant women) have to do is -Take folic acid tablets as soon as you are diagnosed of pregnancy or Start taking them even before conception.Because the cause of Neural tube disorders isFolic acid is a nutrient which play key role in development of brain. If the mother is low on folic acid, she might give birth to a child who can look like this. That’s why when the pregnant woman goes for her first visit to doctor, the physician starts her on folic acid immediately.In United States, when a couple plans a child, the doctor instructs the female for taking folic acid tablets even before 3 months of conception.Sadly in India, we don’t have such conscious couples.Let me tell you some simple math:Cost of operation of baby with spina bifida: Around lakhs + your mental distressCost of folic acid tablets- Rs. 5/- for 5 or 10 tablets.I guess, I don’t have to explain further as the math says it all.Stay Healthy Stay Happy :)",407 followers,Ankit Kumar,519,0,0,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-do-you-know-that-most-people-don%E2%80%99t

When the tea is in a cup it takes more time to cool down , so we prefer to pour it in a saucer to increase its cooling rate. And further blow air over the tea to further cool it faster .The principle behind this, is to increase the surface area of tea exposed to atmosphere , in the same way fins are also used to increase the surface area and to cool down faster .Its application can also be seen in electronic circuitsRed coloured part in above picture.These small elements you didn't notice also play a vital role in proper functioning of the equipmentsQ.2 WHY ARE ELECTRICAL WIRES INSULATED ?AnsReason 1:-REASON 2 :- Another reason behind is to again increase the Heat Transfer Rate which is produced while transmitting current .The dissipation of heat from the electrical wire is necessary because it reduces the conductivity of the wire leading to decrease in current flow .Heat generated = I*I*R .You could not select any random thickness of the insulator as it may lead to decrease in Heat Transfer Rate instead of increasing it .So the thickness of the insulating material of electrical wire is also carefully calculated which usually is in the order of “2–3 mm” .Thank you .Edit : Another fact added .",41 followers,Laksh Nandwani,543,0,0,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-do-you-know-that-most-people-don%E2%80%99t

484,I am not sure they decide which countries are sovereign and which are not. I think it is a matter of recognizing a particular government as legitimate or not. I am unaware of any Country that the US has decided is not a sovereign country. That being said if a group decide that a region of an existing country is now an independent country then several factors would come into play.

485,"Very simply: only when it suits them.In other words, the USA doesn’t care about the sovereignty of nations. They either have thralls or enemies. If a nation has something which they want, they will either constrain their government to give it to them, by either devious ways (ex., peak technologies of Japan or France or others) or by violent means (viz., subversion in Venezuela or other countries, or war as in Iraq or Lybia).There are no sovereign nations in the eyes of the USA.",20 followers,Paul Mitchell,1.9K,7K,10.7M,2019,https://www.quora.com/In-what-year-do-you-think-humanity-will-leave-the-Solar-System

That is why when a country invades another to change their government or seize government, it is considered an illegal act of aggression. The legal theory behind sovereignty is that in democracies “sovereignty resides in the people.” The people of a nation hold sovereignty and their rulers rule with the consent of the people. In a dictatorship, a single person or persons seize sovereignty from the people and govern with or without consent. It is the same with some monarchies - the rulers inherit their positions or seize their positions and they rule or occupy their positions without the express consent of the people. In countries that have revolutions, the people rise up to change their rulers or ruling system because they are withdrawing their consent to be ruled by the persons in power. One of the reasons that the US has had such failures with their attempts at regime change is because they act without the consent of the people of that nation. Those attempts are usually doomed from the start.
