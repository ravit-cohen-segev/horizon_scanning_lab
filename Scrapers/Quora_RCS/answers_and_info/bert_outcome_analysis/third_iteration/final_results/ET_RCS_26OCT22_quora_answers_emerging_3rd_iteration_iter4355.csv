3,"There is a lot of excellent content related to this question already on Quora.It’s worth pondering two built-in human drives — competition and cooperation — and how they have played out in various cultures over history. We are social, and both want to (and generally need to) live in groups to survive. This requires degrees of cooperation. But then we generally compete at most levels.I think the large claim that most advances in human civilization have come mostly from cooperation can be substantiated (and that various forms of competition are mostly not positive, and even when they seem to be,There is a lot of excellent content related to this question already on Quora.It’s worth pondering two built-in human drives — competition and cooperation — and how they have played out in various cultures over history. We are social, and both want to (and generally need to) live in groups to survive. This requires degrees of cooperation. But then we generally compete at most levels.I think the large claim that most advances in human civilization have come mostly from cooperation can be substantiated (and that various forms of competition are mostly not positive, and even when they seem to be, are of less worth than cooperation would have been).And I think that we have to consider “human communication” to be much more than getting signals of one kind or another from human to human. It’s worth comparing the thought patterns of oral societies to those with writing and schooling: they are qualitatively different, and it is the latter that is associated with the building towards “civilization”.Most recent media technologies — from the telephone on to radio, TV, etc — have facilitated oral modes of thought, including the oral structuring of thought (e.g. chat and Twitter). I.e. the facilitation is of means that require little to no learning, and thus require no major changes in skills/internal-structurings.One of the large shifts in perspective about learning media in the 20th century is the realization that it is the *difficulty of learning* that requires large changes of skill/internal structurings, and if this is coupled with new powerful ways to represent ideas, large positive changes can be expected. These insights were famously associated with McLuhan, but many others contributed — Innis, Havelock, Ong, Eisenstein, Postman, etc.Engelbart’s large contributions to the world included the idea that a reasonable “augmented human” is *not* created by just giving a powerful tool to a person.Instead, he pointed out that (a) “augmentation” included most strongly the *non-optional requirement* for deep training and education to acquire deep skills in using the great new powers of technology and (b) that since most things are done by humans in groups, it is critical to also “augment the collective IQ of groups” with training/education to use powers with collaborative tools.One of the underlying ideas here is that available powers plus the impulse to compete generally results in poor to bad uses of the powers. Simplistic image: cave people with atomic weapons (which is pretty much what we have today).Another way to look at this issue is that deep training/education is part of what “developed cultures” require in many different areas — including science, engineering, etc. and in developed music and arts. They all require quite a bit of education and training to deal with. They turn into trivial and often ultimately dangerous pop culture expressions and weapons without the deep prep.So — to gesture at the question — I would say that “human communication” with respect to important discourse has been mostly retrograded by poor untrained uses of modern technologies, and that our stronger competitive impulses are overwhelming needs for cooperation.McLuhan pointed out in the early 60s that a networked world would produce a kind of “global village” (which he was not in favor of) where, among many results, would be that everyone would know what everyone else was doing. A disastrous consequence would be massive loss of identity, and fierce efforts — including war — to reclaim a feeling of it. One of the manifestations would be demands to *participate* but not coupled with interests to “cooperate”.","358,942 followers",Sean Kernan,8.6K,5.6K,726.8M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-ever-happened-to-Elizabeth-Holmes-the-head-of-Theranos-who-faked-successful-technology-for-revolutionary-blood-analysis-robbed-investors-and-the-US-Government-of-Billions
