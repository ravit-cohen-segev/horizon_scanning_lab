Let's look at these qualities one at a time.After much investigations and research i have made about how to earn more profit on cryptocurrency legitimately, I will recommend CryptoExchangeFX Cryptocurrency Investment Platform (www.cryptoexchangefx,com) as it is relatively on for a while now (launched at mid-summer 2017) but has become the largest Cryptocurrency Investment Platform right now (total volume over 120 million dollars) where you get 20% profit of your invested cryptocurrency after every 10 days. It supports variety of cryptocurrency like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin and other Altcoins. I find that it has a really nice UI and support.1) ScarcityThe key to the maintenance of a currency's value is its supply. A money supply that is too large could cause prices of goods to spike, resulting in economic collapse. A money supply that is too small can also cause economic problems. Monetarism is the macroeconomic concept which aims to address the role of the money supply in the health and growth (or lack thereof) in an economy.In the case of fiat currencies, most governments around the world continue to print money as a means of controlling scarcity. Many governments operate with a preset amount of inflation which serves to drive the value of the fiat currency down. In the U.S., for instance, this rate has historically hovered around 2%. This is different from bitcoin, which has a flexible issuance rate which changes over time.2) DivisibilitySuccessful currencies are divisible into smaller incremental units. In order for a single currency system to function as a medium of exchange across all types of goods and values within an economy, it must have the flexibility associated with this divisibility. The currency must be sufficiently divisible so as to accurately reflect the value of every good or service available throughout the economy.3) UtilityA currency must-have utility in order to be effective. Individuals must be able to reliably trade units of the currency for goods and services. This is a primary reason why currencies developed in the first place: so that participants in a market could avoid having to barter directly for goods. Utility also requires that currencies be easily moved from one location to another. Burdensome precious metals and commodities don't easily meet this stipulation.4) TransportabilityCurrencies must be easily transferred between participants in an economy in order to be useful. In fiat currency terms, this means that units of currency must be transferable within a particular country's economy as well as between nations via exchange.5) DurabilityTo be effective, a currency must be at least reasonably durable. Coins or notes made out of materials that can easily be mutilated, damaged, or destroyed, or which degrade over time to the point of being unusable, are not sufficient.6) CounterfeitabilityJust as a currency must be durable, it must also be difficult to counterfeit in order to remain effective. If not, malicious parties could easily disrupt the currency system by flooding it with fake bills, thereby negatively impacting the currency's value.To assess Bitcoin's value as a currency, we'll compare it against fiat currencies in each of the above categories.Bitcoin Compared Against Fiat Currencies1) ScarcityWhen Bitcoin was launched in 2009, its developer(s) stipulated in the protocol that the supply of tokens would be capped at 21 million. To give some context, the current supply of bitcoin is around 18 million, the rate at which Bitcoin is released decreases by half roughly every four years, and the supply should get past 19 million in the year 2022. This assumes that the protocol will not be changed. Note that changing the protocol would require the concurrence of a majority of the computing power engaged in Bitcoin mining, meaning that it is unlikely.The approach to supply that Bitcoin has adopted is different from most fiat currencies. The global fiat money supply is often thought of as broken into different buckets, M0, M1, M2, and M3. M0 refers to currency in circulation. M1 is M0 plus demand deposits like checking accounts. M2 is M1 plus savings accounts and small time deposits (known as certificates of deposit in the United States). M3 is M2 plus large time deposits and money market funds. Since M0 and M1 are readily accessible for use in commerce, we will consider these two buckets as medium of exchange, whereas M2 and M3 will be considered as money being used as a store of value. As part of their monetary policy, most governments maintain some flexible control over the supply of currency in circulation, making adjustments depending upon economic factors. This is not the case with Bitcoin. So far, the continued availability of more tokens to be generated has encouraged a robust mining community, though this is liable to change significantly as the limit of 21 million coins is approached.What exactly will happen at that time is difficult to say; an analogy would be to imagine the U.S. government suddenly ceased to produce any new bills. Fortunately, the last Bitcoin is not scheduled to be mined until around the year 2140. Generally, scarcity can drive value higher. This can be seen with precious metals like gold.2) Divisibility21 million Bitcoins is vastly smaller than the circulation of most fiat currencies in the world. Fortunately, Bitcoin is divisible up to 8 decimal points. The smallest unit, equal to 0.00000001 Bitcoin, is called a ""Satoshi"" after the pseudonymous developer behind the cryptocurrency. This allows for quadrillions of individual units of Satoshis to be distributed throughout a global economy.One bitcoin has a much larger degree of divisibility than the U.S. dollar as well as most other fiat currencies. While the U.S. dollar can be divided into cents, or 1/100 of 1 USD, one ""Satoshi"" is just 1/100,000,000 of 1 BTC. It is this extreme divisibility which makes bitcoin's scarcity possible; if bitcoin continues to gain in price over time, users with tiny fractions of a single bitcoin can still take part in everyday transactions. Without any divisibility, a price of, say, $1,000,000 for 1 BTC would prevent the currency being used for most transactions.3) UtilityOne of the biggest selling points of Bitcoin has been its use of blockchain technology. Blockchain is a distributed ledger system that is decentralized and trustless, meaning that no parties participating in the Bitcoin market need to establish trust in one another in order for the system to work properly. This is possible thanks to an elaborate system of checks and verifications which is central to the maintenance of the ledger and to the mining of new Bitcoins. Best of all, the flexibility of blockchain technology means that it has utility outside of the cryptocurrency space as well.4) TransportabilityThanks to cryptocurrency exchanges, wallets, and other tools, Bitcoin is transferable between parties within minutes, regardless of the size of the transaction with very low costs. The process of transferring money in the current system can take days at a time and have fees. Transferability is a hugely important aspect of any currency. While it takes vast amounts of electricity to mine Bitcoin, maintain the blockchain, and process digital transactions, individuals do not typically hold any physical representation of Bitcoin in the process.5) DurabilityDurability is a major issue for fiat currencies in their physical form. A dollar bill, while sturdy, can still be torn, burned, or otherwise rendered unusable. Digital forms of payment are not susceptible to these physical harms in the same way. For this reason, bitcoin is tremendously valuable. It cannot be destroyed in the same way that a dollar bill could be. That's not to say, however, that bitcoin cannot be lost. If a user loses his or her cryptographic key, the bitcoins in the corresponding wallet may be effectively unusable on a permanent basis. However, the bitcoin itself will not be destroyed and will continue to exist in records on the blockchain.6) CounterfeitabilityThanks to the complicated, decentralized blockchain ledger system, bitcoin is incredibly difficult to counterfeit. Doing so would essentially require confusing all participants in the Bitcoin network, no small feat. The only way that one would be able to create a counterfeit bitcoin would be by executing what is known as a double spend. This refers to a situation in which a user ""spends"" or transfers the same bitcoin in two or more separate settings, effectively creating a duplicate record. While this is not a problem with a fiat currency note—it is impossible to spend the same dollar bill in two or more separate transactions—it is theoretically possible with digital currencies.What makes a double spend unlikely, though, is the size of the Bitcoin network. A so-called 51% attack, in which a group of miners theoretically control more than half of all network power, would be necessary. By controlling a majority of all network power, this group could dominate the remainder of the network to falsify records. However, such an attack on Bitcoin would require an overwhelming amount of effort, money, and computing power, thereby rendering the possibility extremely unlikely.",2 followers,Kelly Pearson,1.7K,0,0,2020,https://www.quora.com/How-are-the-Bitcoins-and-Blockchain-technologies-connected

The value of one bitcoin fluctuates wildly and unpredictably, and there is no authority overseeing its use. Cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin exist too , on other blockchains, and are used for various applications, mostly not as currencies.Blockchain is the technology that powers Bitcoin. It is a decentralised public ledger of all transactions in the network. Blockchain consists of blocks containing batches of recent valid transactions - i.e., they have not yet been entered into any previous blocks - to which are appended timestamp links so that every member can have its own copy. Each new member must complete proof-of-work, demonstrating that it has done enough calculation before being allowed into the system (i.e., mining). If accepted by consensus, each block is then timestamped, irreversibly linking it to the previous block(s), thus giving rise to a chain or blockchain.When multiple transactions are entered on to the blockchain, each transaction is checked against all previous ones and a new block is only created if they match (or it fits with respect to blocks already on the chain). This ensures that once a transaction has been made, it cannot be changed by anyone. This technology manages all bitcoin software-based transactions conducted among users of this currency; processing more than seven billion dollars' worth of financial transactions per day.","31,157 followers",Phillip Remaker,1.7K,11K,78.8M,2021,https://www.quora.com/How-are-the-Bitcoins-and-Blockchain-technologies-connected

Though the technology is known , still the technology is not perfected in any production cars.Its called holygrail in IC engine technology known as Homogenous Charge Compression Ignition. Recently ( mid 2017 ) Mazda announced that they have found a way to bring this technology into automotive world. But Mercedes have acess to this technology long back in 2014.Mercedes had to work With Mahle to achieve this technolgy. They just have used a old school technolgy to achieve HCCI called as Prechamber ignition or Indirect injection ( the technology which old school diesel engine used before common rail injection ).The technology was named Turblent Jet ignition by Mahle ( Technolgy is not purely HCCI its a way technolgy to achieve HCCI mode of combustion like a RCCI this can be called as Spark induced compression ignition.The fuel injector and sparkplug are housed closer in seperate precombustion chamber as shown in above image.

The driver waits until he feels he has sufficient energy to thrust ahead.And when the right moment arrives, the driver surges ahead utilizing the energy and leaving his opponent behind.Of course, there are on board instruments which assist the drivers in doing so, and constructors are constantly trying to reduce the effects of the downward force.Of course, such overtakes are pure bliss!","14,230 followers",Saran Udayakumar,23.7K,1K,29.3M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-unknown-facts-about-F1-racing

In Sweden there is a law that every store has to askPeople don’t make friends. People don’tOne reason for the loneliness is that Swedish people are very anxious of doing something wrong or saying something wrong. This has an old tradition and still today there are many things a person could say that would immediately get him disqualified from the social group.Most conversations among the middle class are superficial because Swedes are so afraid of conflicts. Nothing sensitive can be discussed, so topics are limited to things most everyone can agree on, such as “we should feel sorry for poor people”, or “Russia is dangerous”. I don’t actually agree on these things but I keep my mouth shut. Speaking against the consensus will just upset people, even insult them.Note that none of these people will ever assist you or help you if you should need them. Your relationship with them is purely based on your fear of being shamed, an outcast. Because others won’t help you, you also don’t see any reason to help them.After a while you will ask yourself if you are the one who is crazy, or if everyone else is. Then you will retreat and stop socializing because it is so pointless anyway. And most of the autumn and winter is dark… very dark.How do people meet? Internet dating, mostly. Superficial dating where it is all about looks to get casual sex and feel good for a while. There you have the reason why Swedes love the gym and looking good: otherwise they are stuck in their small and lonely apartments.This pathological loneliness is perhaps the reason why our politicians decided we needed to be more multicultural and opened the borders to large scale immigration.EDIT",202 followers,Ken Arrington,2.6K,0,0,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-unknown-facts-about-F1-racing
16,"One of the scariest things about K-Pop I sometimes think about is the treatment of female idols and trainees in the industry.I’m not talking about double standards between male and female idols; I’m talking about how girls and women are treated like objects and subjected to sexual violence.This is what I mean:A male MC’s inappropriate actions toward (G)I-DLE’s Minnie:Look at how shamelessly he’s staring at Minnie’s thighsYou could literally see that Minnie was uncomfortable because she kept grabbing for the blanket to cover her thighs, crossing her legs, and moving closer to ShuhuOne of the scariest things about K-Pop I sometimes think about is the treatment of female idols and trainees in the industry.I’m not talking about double standards between male and female idols; I’m talking about how girls and women are treated like objects and subjected to sexual violence.This is what I mean:A male MC’s inappropriate actions toward (G)I-DLE’s Minnie:Look at how shamelessly he’s staring at Minnie’s thighsYou could literally see that Minnie was uncomfortable because she kept grabbing for the blanket to cover her thighs, crossing her legs, and moving closer to Shuhua. This creep then decided to scoot closer to Minnie as well:He then tried to(They all looked so concerned. Shuhua and Yuqi look disgusted.)It’s so obvious that she was very taken aback from the gesture and felt super uncomfortable. (And I’m pretty sure MCs don’t normally go this far into invading celebrities’ personal spaces.)After many people called this MC out for his behavior, the program wrote a half-assed apology about how it was a “concept”. At first, I thought fans were just overreacting but the apology really did it. The program didn’t even bother covering up the fact that what the MC did was inappropriate.If perverts like this guy are not afraid to do these kinds of things on camera, then I don’t even want to think about what some people do when the public isn’t watching…After the girl group Yellow Bee disbanded, one of the former members Ari said,“Company employees and managers sexually harassed us.A Yellow Bee member was dragged to the practice room and molested by one of them, though everyone else tried to stop him.There were even times when they called us to go drink in the middle of the night. Of course we had to keep quiet about this just because of our dream of becoming a singer.”(These men knew full well that they had the upper-hand because they were the higher-ups and they used their positions to their advantage by forcibly molesting and sexually harassing these girls. It’s disgusting.)Former After School’s Yoo Soyoung said,“The issue of sexual abuse occurs all the time. For example, once we went to drink and I was about to go home. At that time, the CEO said that he would take me home.I was the only woman there and when we got in the taxi, he held my hand. I knew at that moment I had to be alert.I tried to send the CEO away after getting out of the taxi, but he got off after me and said he wanted to talk to me. It was late at night and nothing was open, and I was scared, so we went to a fast food place that was open 24 hours.He held my hand and said, ‘I like you and see you as a woman. I’m not going to let you go until you say okay.’ I told him, ‘I’m sorry but I don’t see it like that. Please cancel my contract as well.’(The fact that some girls and women are even aware of this issue and it has even happened more than one time to most of them sends chills down my spine.)And don’t even get me started with the whole ‘sponsor’ thing. It’s literally just a nicer term for ‘forced prostitution’.Reporter Kim Myosung said,“I personally met a businessman that received offers to sponsor. He said he received a list of female stars that included girl groups. I saw the list myself and was shocked. They included different tiers (levels) and the prices next to their names.People that many have heard of were in the top tier and the lower tier included less popular members in popular girl groups.When they get pregnant, they always take care of it (get an abortion) outside of the country. Also, separate expenses for it are included.”(Her explanation literally makes me sick. Sponsors areThe worst part about it is that most of the men (and women) that does these terrible things are not receiving the punishments they deserve. They do what they want and they get away with it.And very unfortunately, these problems are also “it is what it is” kind of problems. Many South Koreans know about this issue and they have tried to change it but they don’t have enough power to do so.A lot of international fans hear about these stories either from scandals or rumors but they often just brush it off. I do hope that more K-Pop fans become aware of this matter and actually consider the dangers within the industry, especially the ones that are planning to audition for companies or have already auditioned.",0 followers,Giang Nguyen,1.6K,75,1.6M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-unknown-facts-about-F1-racing

We look like solid mountains, but when pushed, we will explode quickly and with great violence…and this in many ways frightens us as much as it may frighten you. So to protect ourselves, and you, we do the most painful thing we can do to a member of the human race.You no longer exist.This is the true dark side of the INTP.

When an INTP walks away from you, you must realize…Enemies exist.And yes, in truth I may occasionally think of you, or occasionally think fondly on times past. There may even be a small emotional quiver. But we have a distinct ability to slice that emotional equation into shredded bits once we recall the uncontrolled emotional turmoil we experienced in that dreadful moment where we realized you were manipulating us through emotions to achieve an aim that was not beneficial to all of us.But remember, this ability exists to protect ourselves…and you.Therefore, you do not exist.It is through this ability that many INTPs are considered emotional automatons. But it is through this vicious ability that we protect ourselves. The INTP IS an emotional creature. We just filter that emotion through many different levels and differently that most personalities.

You won’t see any strikes, protests, or severely criticism about the country from the citizens. If they were found, the government would immediately take them down to zero such as sending them to jail or expel out from the country. That’s why Singapore is such a safe and green country.“Freedom”! Yes, Singapore still provide you a decent freedom, you can do anything as long as it doesn’t cause problems to the society and the government. As long as you don’t go challenge the rules and regulations of Singapore, you be fine to live in this country. Challenge such as starting a strike for freedom of speech, or strike for minimum wages, or protest against government laws. In other countries, going strikes or protests, are a sort of a freedom act for people to stand up for what they belief are right. In Singapore, this means you trying to cause disruption to the country which will cause problems (in the eye of the government). Even now, athens goverment has set up a speaker corner for the public to speak out freely publicly, before you can do that, you need to submit application for approval to the police force before you can organize and give a public speech. So the police is the representative of the goverment, so they will screen the contents of your speech, if found that it is against the goverment, it won’t be approved at all. That’s why I say “high class” because normally people who been sentence to prison don’t have freedom to freely do their own things in the premises.Furthermore, if you live in Singapore for long, you will find that you would be slowly “brain wash” by the goverment. LOL. All the local media such as local TV news, local newspapers, local magazines will not say anything bad against the goverment. In fact, the local media will project youhow good and well the goverment have done and contributed. When there’s a raised of Singaporean complains about the housing development in Singapore, the local media will show or talk about how bad is the housing development in Hong Kong. By doing that, Singaporean will think how lucky they are compared to Hong Kong and they will stop complaining about it. Same things happen when the Singapore train system was having problems, the local media will show or talk about other countries train system like Indian or London, how badly they are such as overcrowded or trains often delayed etc.. Then Singaporean start to think that Singapore train system is actually very good.I have travelled a lot to different part of (developing, developed and emerging) countries and when I travel, I read their locals news, watch their local tv and experience their true local cultures whether bad or good. I remembered I travelled to Athen, Greece, and went to see the protest against their government and also experience their taxi strike. In Istanbul, Turkey, walked along Taksim street, followed a group of students who were walking towards the Taksim square to protest. In UK, newspapers and TV showing news about how people were unhappy with the goverment of sending troops to Iraq and resulting young soldiers got killed, lots of negatives critisms were throwing at the goverment. I never seen it happened at all in Singapore, so above all is how I view Singapore.Overall, if you don’t mind all the issues that I mentioned, Singapore is a good country or a heaven for you to live, hence, there is no dark side. Beside, Singaporean goverment always do things transparent so you can hardly see any shadows or grey areas.","43,426 followers",Misha Firer,3.4K,1.3K,133.8M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-unknown-facts-about-F1-racing

Like every other village in Russia it has no indoor plumbing, no sewage, no running water, no central heating, no natural gas line, and regular power outages.Saint Petersburg is only 200 miles away, yet the route that connects Samolva to the “highway” is a dirt track in the woods, and it’s a challenge to leave the village in the fall, winter and spring.Many houses are abandoned as young people have moved to big cities that offer jobs and modern amenities. This is an old chapel in the woods.A fire department occupies a 19th century dilapidated mansion that has never been restored.Samolva is a historical location. On April 5, 1242 on Lake Peipus near the Crow Stone (see above) took place a battle between the Russian force led by Alexander Nevsky and Teutonic Knights, nicknamed “Battle on the Ice.”Alexander Nevsky was an adopted son of Batu Khan, a ruler of the Golden Horde aka Tatar Mongol Choke that occupied and pillaged Russia for more than two hundred years.On behalf of the Khan, Alexander Nevsky collected tributes (taxes) from Russian towns. Those who refused to pay to the Great Khan, Alexander gouged out eyes, cut off noses and chopped off hands. He burned whole towns to the ground. When his brother Andrei Syuzdalsky was about to rebel against Tatar-Mongols, Alexander Nevsky tipped off Mongols.Pskov boyars resisted the conquest of their lands by Tatar Mongols. For that purpose, they allied with Teutonic Knights. Their defeat on the Lake Peipus symbolised the ultimate victory of the Tatar-Mongols and their Russian collaborators over the European civilisation.And that is why Samolva, unlike Western Europe where Teutonic Knights were from, has no indoor plumbing, no roads, no gas line, no central heating, no septic tanks.Residents use shovels to dig holes in the ground to shit and piss. There’s a brick wood stove to survive through cold winter that uses exactly the same technology and design as a millennium ago. There’s a garden to grow vegetables because residents are too poor to buy groceries in the store.Alexander Nevsky became a hero in the USSR when the Soviet Politburo sought a role model to turn Russians into state serfs. Film director Sergey Eisenstein fabricated events leading to this decisive battle in his eponimous film.Current kleptocratic rulers decided to revive the traitor and mass murderer of his people for the 21st century after Pskov church archbishop Tikhon submitted a personal initiative to the the Armed Forces to build a monument dedicated to Alexander Nevsky near Samolva.Within days, engineer corps built a paved road between the highway and the future monument for the first time ever but failed to extend it to Samolva.The bronze monument was built in 40 days. It cost 17 million rubles, and illumination alone will cost 7 million ruble per month, or more than an average resident of Samolva earns in a lifetime.It’s quite interesting to hear the reaction of Samolva residents. In summary: “we wish they would spend that money on improving living conditions of our village, but a monument is also a good thing. Better a monument than nothing.”A Westerner would exclaim, “people come first! A monument in bronze in the middle of nowhere is far less important.”And that’s the reason why Westerners don’t understand why Russians continue to support Putin, his cronies and oligarchs despite their massive theft.“Putin is keeping Teutonic Knights at bay. Our Tatar-Mongol Khanate is ours and we love it.”And so Alexander Nevsky monument near Samolva is dedicated to the real history and not a fabricated one.","17,165 followers",Pascal Morimacil,676,4.3K,34.7M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-dark-side-behind-a-cryptocurrency

Ever heard of lines like - “Sharma ji ke bete ne **insert some achivement**. Tum kya karoge ?”When a guy gets into IIT, his relatives; friends and relatives of relatives; parents, relatives and friends of his friend who didn’t get into IIT- basically every known person of the society attaches the IIT tag with him. And that friend who didn’t get into IIT also has to face uninvited discrimination.Once the IITian tag is attached, peoples’ expectations skyrocket. But the reality is that people tend to compare themselves with their peers. All IITians are brilliant in the eyes of an outsider. But IITians never feel that way. The practical difference one feels after getting into an IIT is that now he is living among high IQ bastards. Such an environment surely provides an incentive. One gets opportunity to have so many intellectual discussions on such a plethora of topics that he will cherish for his lifetime. These things do set apart the IITians from the rest to a certain extent. But not too much. That’s just the tip of the peak which one encounters early into the IITs. As I said before, people tend to compare themselves with their peers. And this peer pressure is enormous. And people do succumb to it. For example consider the CSE guys at IITK. They are among the top notch rankers in JEE. Do all succeed ? No. I know many people who have lost interest in their studies. Why so?For some it is because they never had interest in it but were forced to study and clear JEE and are still under pressure to succeed in their field. Imagine a guy dropping his degree to pursue something else of his interest. He can do it but how many eyebrows will be raised? He can’t even quantify that, the thought of doing it rests in peace. That is the case with anyone in India thinking of dropping what he is currently pursuing. For an IITian, the higher expectations pressurize him even more.For some others it is because they did put the efforts but their grades got slammed because of the fierce competition. And slowly they started losing motivation to study and eventually stopped studying. One of my teachers had once told us that for human mind, logic is simple- “jab tak grades ache aa rahe, subject ‘interesting’ lagta hai. jaise hi number aane band ho jaate hain, ‘interest’ uthne lagta hai subject se. you start hating it”. Believe it or not, but that’s the way human brain is conditioned. I can bet you that atleast 20% of guys pursuing CSE@IITK have stopped studying. They would do anything else but studies. You will observe similar patterns in all branches at all IITs. That’s the fact. Accept it or ignore it. But how long can you ignore? This is prevelant worldwide. Help yourself with this mind blowing talk by Malcolm Gladwell to get a better idea of it-That was about IITians and the impact of Indian society on them. What about non-IITians? Even they suffer the repercussions of the Indian society. Most of them suffer it throughout their life. Some cope up to the pressure once they join some other college. Most of these people are the ones who perform well at their respective college. They become numb to society because they know they are doing well at their college, so they are better than at least someone. Well, that’s what Gladwell points out as well.How to change the mindset of Indians ? I don’t think anything can be done with the existing generation of parents and elders. What we can do is shape the minds of the current young generation whose children will be studying in colleges 20 years down the line. Shaping the minds of current generation of students will require a lot of efforts to counter the effects of the existing society. I know most people will not agree with my suggestion which I am about to state and the reason is the suggestion itself.Don’t try to go about convincing the whole of society to understand and change. We just need the right set of people at the higher authoritative positions to hard force ways (make rules) to bring about the change. A generation might have to bear the forced changes, but they will slowly realize the value of those changes and majority of the following generation will benefit from it.Now, what kind of changes ?These are just a few suggestions. Obviously one can come up with even more practical suggestions. Your suggestions are welcome :) So is criticism :)",3 followers,Rahul Sharma,547,1.1K,49.2M,2016,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-unknown-facts-about-F1-racing

How can one get admission in for btech when their entrance exam simply doesnt have a cs section. How are you gonna judge the talent of a cs student by his marks in PCM. Similarly if you like physics then how can someone expect u to be extremly good at chem and maths.You only have 1 life my friend. Do what you like and not something society forces you to. Be yourself and dont be someone else. Just because you dont graduate from IIT doesnt mean u are not worthy. If not IIT then try elsewhere. So many colleges give u financial aid and can help you. Do what you like bro. Study because you want to study, dont study because “What will people say if i dont graduate from IITB”.I know people will think i say all of this simply because i wasnt admitted but let me tell you. I went foreign studies there did my research and honestly today when i look back i enjoyed every moment of it. I did what i loved and today i dont even think for a second that my life isnt what i want.in the words of aamir khan from 3 idiots“pursue excellence and success will chase you”Maybe after graduating from IIT you will get a good salary and a good 9–5 job. But u will have wasted a part of your life which u can never get back. U studies while others were partying, enjoying, or doing their things. Life is beautiful man. Thank god for giving you a chance to experience life. Dont go after a college.

We all have heard that phrase""Vo to IIT ki tayari kar raha hai""students as early as 6th standard now see these pamphlets in newspapers and over the years they become obsessed with the word IIT-JEE. Sadly, the present scenario is no longer finding your interests in life and then choosing a course but preparing for IIT. If you ask 11th and 12th standard students why you want to do engineering, they are clueless. It just reflects how these coaching institutes are successful in brainwashing students who are not even interested in engineering.Multinational Corporation PlacementsEvery year we see the best of placements come from IITs. I am not saying that IITians don't deserve it but other college students who are doing engineering also deserve it. But a majority of companies hire only from top notch IITs and NITs.

But have we asked ourselves that how many of those research work actually reach people and are applied for the benefit of the society? The answer is NONE because these state of art research papers are published in a Reputed Journal and are kept away from the public (well unless one pays a good sum of money for it).The world today is on the brink of eradicating Polio just because the man (Jonas Edward Salk) who discovered the vaccine did not get a patent for it, thus making it easy to produce anywhere in the world. If he were even a bit selfish at that stage, he would have outrun the worlds richest man by far.We still celebrate our old great alums who have made a great impact but we fail to see what we are doing as a new generation of IITians. Every year around 10,000 IITs graduate from various IITs across India and how many of them do something that contributes to the society? The answer would be 5–10 at max. What about the other 9,990? Are they not part of the system?The only way we can make a great society is not by celebrating those handful students who made a mark, but by asking the remaining 9,990 as to where they went wrong.

They started saying that we use the tax payers’ money and go abroad, and contribute nothing.Being still in earlier semesters of my stay, I did not know what to answer. You see, I did not know back then what exactly was expected out on an IITian. So, I decided to study what was being taught and attempt to one day prove them wrong. I mean how can an overrated set of institutions get one of the brightest minds in the country every year? I continued with the branch I was assigned as I was as clueless about my branch as I was about others.In most answers I see people blame the professors for lacking the charm of generating interest among students, but honestly in my 4 years, in each and every class that I seriously wanted to study, I got the best mind in the whole country teaching me that. I started noticing two sets of people: one were self motivated and other were still looking for motivation. And, I think that was the only difference. I had in my class as my friends , students from all backgrounds. I have seen students who could not understand any lecture being taught in English in their first year, who finally in their fourth year were fluent in English with unmatchable personality. I have seen students teach the underprivileged kids of neighboring village and I have also seen students with no laboratory infrastructure at their schools build machine to solve problems. And believe me, all of them still in their under-graduation in various fields.When I first came, I expected IIT to give me best infrastructure and best guides, and it did. To me, it is not overrated because it delivered what I expected out of it. I still do not know the answer to question that corners me into proving my worth as a recipient of IIT education, and I guess only time will tell.

They really have the potential. IITs create an environment where you thrive but that doesn’t mean everybody is taking advantage of this. Many people judge far early the importance of their field - supply and demand of engineers in their field and start doing something else. And, in these cases also some achieve great heights because IIT is not just about Technology and Engineering, it is much more.For those who are comfortable reading for long, I would like to write long. I am writing about my life-changing journey at IIT-Bombay. I shall only tell you the story and leave you to think and judge what potential an IIT has.Life before joining IIT:During my 12th std, I had not joined any tuition in my town and we had almost no teachers in school, So I mugged up my 12th books as thoroughly as I could. (I remembered answers of all the math questions even before appearing for the exams)Out of the blue, I scored 92.92 % in RBSE (a blissful shock). To this day I can’t believe that I did that. But, it changed my life altogether. My family planned to send me to KOTA, (thanks to a senior who had just cleared JEE) and I was given significant concession for my studies there based on my RBSE performance.For the first time in my life, I came to know what IIT is. Sometimes, it can be a question of life or death for some. One of my classmates committed suicide thinking that he was under-performing but he was really talented student and would have gone on to make a mark but instead chose otherwise. Kota was nothing more than a pressure cooker. Final IIT exam seemed ten times easier than my coaching institute exams. People admired IIT all around to such an extent that one day on being asked by my teacher - “What is the best thing you have seen in your life”, one of my classmates responded that he had seen the entrance of an IIT.I always thought that my rank would be around 3000 but once again something miraculous happened and I got 1211. (I felt that somebody in the universe was conspiring to lead me somewhere). My family had no idea what that rank meant, they were happy that I had passed.Without enough forethought, I filled my counseling preferences. Only advice a wise man gave me was “In no case you should leave IITB, IITD and IITK”. I was offered Aerospace Engineering at IITB. I was totally indifferent to these chain of events. I had all sorts of apprehensions about Mumbai. Seeing my wavering confidence, my father came to accompany me along with my cousin though he was barely able to walk due to an injury.Life after joining IIT:I didn’t understand an iota during our orientation classes and initial semester-classes. I was petrified looking at 250+ students sitting in a class and asking brilliant questions in English when I was barely able to understand what was going on. I could bear this only for a week and I quit.I dropped all my courses and enrolled myself into an English programme (thankfully it was being run by IIT that year, that was last time it was run) where we studied some 3rd standard English along with some science concepts which we already knew in Hindi. Every day it required 7 hours of classes + homework. Very few people attended the classes sincerely. These classes didn’t do magic instantly but it kept me away from my hostel and into the library. In this English batch, I had people who were like me, unlike hostel where people used to consider me “Gawar (illiterate)”. We had almost zero knowledge of computer, so we were allotted professor for this purpose also. It did make a difference. Professors in these classes mentally prepared us to compete with rest of the IITians.Entering into my second semester, I still could not understand the lectures because my technical vocabulary was way too weak but I never bunked as we were told by our English professors. Slowly, I started lagging behind and to shield my failures, I involved myself in sports extensively. Things took a turn for bad and few courses I barely passed, (Thanks to that same Delhi friend who used to teach me one day before exam). I really came very close to getting a fail grade.In the third semester, we formally entered into our department. I was slowly getting comfortable with lectures but a barrage of derogatory remarks by my friends about my academic performance fuelled my quest to study. I started staying in study room whole night. It was a massive chase. Things started to take off from fourth year onwards. Due to encouraging nature of one professor, I started asking everything in the classroom. Even I got the courage to say, nearly at the end of the lecture “Sir, I could not understand what has been taught in past one hour” and he would reiterate the whole thing in the next class. It did boost my confidence a lot.Library by now had become my second hostel. I had to improve my English and typing speed. I used to pick Aerospace books randomly and read it using dictionary and type randomly on Library PC. I started enjoying those books. I started meeting new people there. Within a year, I became an ambivert if not an extrovert. I became very outspoken and never hesitated in speaking against professors in front of them whenever I felt that something needed to be changed (though many time thoughts of getting rusticated did cross my mind because I was rude)Professors at IIT were very helpful, atleast in my case. The only thing I loved was going to classes. I used to sit in classes and labs from 8:30 to 8:30 every day and late-night in the study room. I never realised when time passed and I kept on improving my academic performance. Every single day, I was feeling getting one step closer to being an engineer.IIT gave us immense freedom. I completed my minor degree in electrical engineering (I no longer hate circuit diagrams), took various courses in mechanical and remote sensing. I came across professors from different engineering fields. Visiting professors in their cabin or discussing with them during tea-time became routine for me. Attending various institute lecture (where dignitaries from outside come and talk on wide-ranging topics) has enlightened me a lot more. It really adds an extra dimension to your thinking.From 7th semester onwards, I started working in labs for a significant amount of time. The first thing which I realised was “Nothing works and you can’t give excuses all the time”. I have not achieved a great deal till now in my research but today I can proudly say that I have acquired an attitude of not quitting.It has been a great journey so far in last 5 years. I am really proud to be a part of this institute and very soon I shall leave this institute. I love mainly because things have been changed by professors because students felt that a changed was required.Just after joining, people used to say that I didn’t deserve IIT but every single day I have waited for the day when my same friends would say “IIT is for people like you”. You can compare what I was just after joining IIT and what I am today. (I am GATE AIR - 6 and I have got academic excellence award twice here at IITB).",113 followers,Anne Hunter,632,352,241.4K,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-dark-side-behind-a-cryptocurrency

IIT is definitely a spearhead of our country when it comes to technology and research. But they need to change the system so that students benefit more from it as it not much inclined towards research. At last whether we are in top 150 college ranking that somewhat matters.

You come to IITs for studying, that is the primary objective of an IIT. Placement is like an incentive for that skill and education. We come here for learning (though, I myself don’t study much). It is an example when the incentive becomes the main aim.Professors are always inclined towards teaching only. During my years, we haven’t been told by professors to get high packages.IITs are the best institutes in India in terms of teaching, laboratory facilities and the amount of technical potential it possesses in their students. There’s no doubt about that.But the lifestyle that the students adopt after coming here makes them lazy and comfortable in the zone they are. Most of them end up realizing that they have the required potential but not the proper mechanism to execute. Everyone of us knows this (except a few). The day when all of them realize their potential and work for it, there will be numerous patents, inventions and world-best companies from our country.PEACE",UNKNOWN,Amarnath,3.4K,131,2.1M,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-dark-side-behind-a-cryptocurrency

It’s brutally repressive and theocratic in the most brutal manner possible. One of its key features is the regime backed religion, the Ecclesiarchy. It preaches absolute loyalty to the Imperium and squashes any signs of heresy/treason it can find (usually by burning people alive).Every now and then however there is someone who will commit a crime against the Imperium that is not completely heinous, such that killing them is not a “just” punishment. That person will be captured and then will be turned into an Arco Flagellant. What exactly does that mean?This is a quote from an Ecclesiarchy official describing exactly what is about to happen to a man who is to be turned into a Flagellant.""Flagellants become in essence unfeeling drones. Their brains are overwritten and wiped of their host personality, with all their will replaced by a burning need to serve the Imperium and slaughter its foes. All they care about is ripping apart whatever poor bastard they are sent against.They are used as shock troops by the Ecclesiarchy and sent against the enemy in waves. With their surgeries, they become immune to pain, fear and logic. In the heat of battle combat drugs injected into their bodies drive them to attack anything alive in their paths, tearing them to pieces with crude melee appendages. They will fight on until eitherOr.The disturbing part is that this is actually seen as a good thing. If a criminal is turned into a Flagellant and dies in the field, he is automatically redeemed by the Ecclesiarchy. In the real world you go to a confession and do good deeds to redeem yourself. InJust remember the lesson here. If you’re going to commit a crime against the Imperium of Man, make sure it is so severe you will be killed on the spot for it, else you may be subjected to something far worse.","2,300 followers",Donovan Walls,1.7K,268,10.2M,2019,https://www.quora.com/How-are-the-Bitcoins-and-Blockchain-technologies-connected

With this revolutionary technology, humans have successfully colonized the entire Solar System, allowing them to travel from Earth to Mars, to back again with relative ease.

With this revolutionary technology, humans have successfully colonized the entire Solar System, allowing them to travel from Earth to Mars, to back again with relative ease. What once would have taken years to travel to, can now be achieved in a matter of seconds.Sounds easy-peasy right?Well there is a catch, of course!YouIf you are conscious while Jaunting, you will go insane, your consciousness doomed to an eternity of oblivion.Imagine being left to only your thoughts, in an endless field of white, for what would feel like billions of years, your sanity slowly disintegrating and mind starting to auto-cannibalize itself.“How long in there, in terms of years? 0.000000000067 seconds for the body to Jaunt, but how long for the unparticulated consciousness? A hundred years? A thousand? A million? A billion? How long alone with your thoughts in an endless field of white? And then, when a billion eternities have passed, the crashing return of light and form and body. Who wouldn't go insane?”For this reason, every person who goes under the Jaunt must be asleep and unconscious. The solution to this is to put everyone under general anesthesia before take-off.But what happens to the poor unfortunate souls who don’t go to sleep? Here is what happened to little Ricky, who held his breath while the attendants administered the anesthesia.The thing that had been his son bounced and writhed on its Jaunt couch, a twelve-year old boy with a snow-white fall of hair and eyes which were incredibly ancient, the corneas gone a sickly yellow. Here was a creature older than time masquerading as a boy; and yet it bounced and writhed with a kind of horrid, obscene glee, and at its choked, lunatic cackles the Jaunt attendants drew back in terror. Some of them fled, although they had been trained to cope with just such an unthinkable eventuality. The old-young legs twitched and quivered. Claw hands beat and twisted and danced on the air; abruptly they descended and the thing that had been his son began to claw at its face. ""Longer than you think, Dad!"" it cackled. ""Longer than you think! Held my breath when they gave me the gas! Wanted to see! I saw! I saw! Longer than you think!"" Cackling and screeching, the thing on the Jaunt couch suddenly clawed its own eyes out. Blood gouted. The recovery room was an aviary of screaming voices now. ""Longer than you think, Dad! I saw! I saw! Long Jaunt! Longer than you think-""It said other things before the Jaunt attendants were finally able to bear it away, rolling its couch swiftly away as it screamed and clawed at the eyes that had seen the unseeable forever and ever; it said other things, and then it began to scream, but Mark Oates didn't hear it because by then he was screaming himself.So remember kids, always go to sleep, so you don’t turn into a creep.In all seriousness, this is probably one of the creepiest technologies available because it combines my 2 biggest fears:It just seems so tempting too. It’s like the elephant game. Tell someone not to think of an elephant. Then they probably automatically think of elephants! Same theory goes with Jaunting, I am sure after being told not to be awake during Jaunting only helped to increase Ricky’s curiosity. And I can relate to that.Also, the Jaunt technology opens up all sorts of sinister possibilities. The Jaunt is purported to have been used by tinpot dictators to get rid of political dissidents, and imagine if someone with connections kicked you awake into a Jaunt portal, while closing up the other exit, leaving you screaming in limbo for eternity….Anyways, I got a flight to catch, see you on the other side of Io, loser.The Jaunt - Stephen King (large text for mobile).pdf",495 followers,Megan McCarthy,3.5K,85,682.3K,2019,https://www.quora.com/How-are-the-Bitcoins-and-Blockchain-technologies-connected

Bank’sIt was a little bundle of what looked like thin, glisteningly blue threads, lying in a shallow bowl; a net, like something you'd put on the end of a stick and go fishing for little fish in a stream. She tried to pick it up; it was impossibly slinky and the material slipped through her fingers like oil; the holes in the net were just too small to put a finger-tip through. Eventually she had to tip the bowl up and pour the blue mesh into her palm. It was very light. Something about it stirred a vague memory in her, but she couldn't recall what it was. She asked the ship what it was, via her neural lace.~ That is a neural lace, it informed her. ~ A more exquisite and economical method of torturing creatures such as yourself has yet to be invented.She gulped, quivered again and nearly dropped the thing.~ Really? she sent, and tried to sound breezy. ~ Ha. I'd never really thought of it that way.~ It is not generally a use much emphasised.Iain M.
