Everything else in an economy exists toSo, if all software is free, presumably meaning that all people can get all the software they need for free, then “for profit” is moot. It’s not like people are owed the ability to make a profit from software (or absolutely anything for that matter). So, taking the premise at face value - ok, great, done! The economy is doing exactly what is doing to perfection - people are getting the software they want AND for free, the best possible outcome for any good or service to that purpose of providing people with the goods and services the need and want.But for fun, let’s relax the premise - people are not getting all the software they need or want for free - well, THAT is an opportunity for profit. That is, a job or a businesses opportunity is producing and providing something which someone wants but does not yet have. Anywhere, anything that people want something they do not yet have - that is a job opportunity or a business opportunity to produce and to provide that good or serve.",181 followers,Inti Gonzalez-Herrera,3.4K,218,866.2K,2021,https://www.quora.com/If-all-software-is-free-except-Microsoft-Windows-is-there-any-hope-for-a-for-profit-industry-that-will-emerge-out-of-information-technology
1,"If all software is free except Microsoft Windows, is there any hope for a ""for profit"" industry that will emerge out of information technology?The problem for customers of proprietary software is “what do you do when the vendor discontinues a product or changes it in a way that that the customer can’t use it?”Most get screwed.That is what happened to many of Microsoft customers… So they had to stick with the old versions… and get blamed for not upgrading (screwed again).And the customer has no choice.",4 followers,Brian Sloan,3.6K,0,0,2021,https://www.quora.com/If-all-software-is-free-except-Microsoft-Windows-is-there-any-hope-for-a-for-profit-industry-that-will-emerge-out-of-information-technology

These are not perfect, but they are not terrible. You can use them and be productive.They even have time to create Edge, which is a big step compared to Internet Explorer. Actually, I was using it last week. It seems pretty fast to me. Still need some work to look (and probably) as good as Chrome and Firefox, but it is not bad at all.Finally, they are also pushing on mobiles and other gadgets.

4,"My industry (sex toys) has high profit margins because the majority of people who have the skills to compete with us are like insecure children, afraid of what their neighbors, family, and friends will think about them. Because they live in constant fear of judgement from other people, they enter more ordinary (and in many cases less profitable) industries that earn them no particular degree of respect from their peers, but they can be sure that no one will think they are perverts, at least not based on their occupations.This isn’t to say there are zero social consequences for us who choose toMy industry (sex toys) has high profit margins because the majority of people who have the skills to compete with us are like insecure children, afraid of what their neighbors, family, and friends will think about them.

I know a very nice guy with 3 kids who was his kid’s soccer team coach for 5 years. Parents found out he owned a large sex toy distributing company and forced him to resign as coach, based on their ludicrous idea that his work meant he might also be a child molester.Other people I’ve met who wanted to enter our industry but didn’t, aren’t afraid of their family and friend’s opinions, but are afraid of whatIn my nearly 10 years making sex toys, I’ve loved telling people “I make a blowjob machine called the Autoblow” and waiting for their response, which 99% of the time is positive and the start of a good conversation.Now that I’m thinking about it I have one story about this - I was on an airplane and the guy next to me was telling me all about the time him and his wife spent volunteering with their church. Then he asked me what I did for a living and I told him. He paused for a second, looked like he was thinking about how to respond, and then told me, “you know, as soon as all my kids left for college, the first thing my wife and I did was go to an adult store we’ve been driving by for years and we bought our first sex toy.” We then continued to have a nice conversation. I know from 10 years in this industry, our products are owned by everyone, especially those who are the most vocally against us!So yes, we can make toys for $10 that sell for $80 (there are certain “luxury” female brands which can assist you in turning their $15 investment into a $200 debit to your bank account), but we occasionally need to confront misunderstandings and stupidity, we occasionally will not be accepted into certain organizations, and we will even sometimes face discrimination from people who think that we are dangerous to their children.What I fear most is that as the adult toy industry becomes more accepted, we may face competition from larger companies with big R&D budgets and bigger marketing channels, ending our enjoyment of our oversized margins.","45,634 followers",David Seidman,1.5K,3.6K,85.1M,2019,https://www.quora.com/If-all-software-is-free-except-Microsoft-Windows-is-there-any-hope-for-a-for-profit-industry-that-will-emerge-out-of-information-technology

6,"I personally think it is ‘cheap energy’. Fourth generation nuclear reactors are around the corner. What is intriguing are variations of the molten salt reactors, known as LFTR, IMSR, MSR and other various acronyms. These are typically high temperature, low pressure reactors with passive fail-safe designs. They don’t require the huge pressure domes and are more efficient in fuel usage. With high temperatures, they offer the ability to produce carbon neutral fuels, desalination of water, hydrolysis of hydrogen and oxygen from water, and the burning of our current toxic waste from Uranium fueledI personally think it is ‘cheap energy’.

12,"1. Wind PowerHuge strides have been made over the past 20 years to harvest the power of wind. Progress is bred from necessity, of course, as growing global concerns about global warming and ecological damage caused by pollution call for cleaner, sustainable energy.2. Solar EnergyMuch like wind energy, solar energy has seen an increase in efficiency and a decrease in price in recent years, making solar power a $3-billion industry. New legislation and regulations which make it affordable for businesses and homeowners to convert to solar are responsible for solar energy’s growth over the past 5 y1.

Progress is bred from necessity, of course, as growing global concerns about global warming and ecological damage caused by pollution call for cleaner, sustainable energy.2. Solar EnergyMuch like wind energy, solar energy has seen an increase in efficiency and a decrease in price in recent years, making solar power a $3-billion industry. New legislation and regulations which make it affordable for businesses and homeowners to convert to solar are responsible for solar energy’s growth over the past 5 years, and 2016 will be no different.While only a third of the solar energy available in the US is currently harnessed in the west, this area is geographically superior for solar power generation, and improved government incentives in California indicate this will be the fastest-growing market.3. 3D PrintingThe new millennium has brought us some mind-blowing technology, but none has more potential for impacting the entire world quite like 3D printing.If you’re not familiar with the concept, 3D printers are loaded with additives which can be used like ink to create 3-dimensional objects. That’s4. Legal MarijuanaLegal marijuana sales have grown exponentially since 2012, when Colorado legalized the drug and created the world’s first fully regulated market for recreational marijuana use. In addition to selling the raw plant, it is also being sold as concentrates, edibles, and even beauty products in order to expand the market.Marijuana sales are expected to surpass $20 billion between now and 2020, and that’s if the market stays its course. If other states legalize recreational marijuana use in that time, the industry could experience even greater success.5. Video GamesOver the years, video game developers have been expanding their appeal to reach new markets, including adults and females. This effort has been paid back many times, as the video game industry commands healthy growth year after year. Consumer confidence continues to improve, and there is speculative excitement regarding new virtual reality (VR) technology.While VR will certainly have an effect on the gaming industry, it also has potential in other markets. Whether or not other industries will adopt VR for practical purposes, such as training medical professionals, remains to be seen.6. Artificial IntelligenceFor having come so far, artificial intelligence still has a long way to go. With hopes that AI will one day be able to help solve humanity’s most pressing concerns, billions of dollars fund the research of artificial intelligence every year. Major players include IT companies like Google and Apple, who are already leaders in the field, providing us with such AI amenities as voice-recognition software and self-driving cars.Experts expect the global demand for “smart” machines will increase 20% every year until at least 2020.7. Sustainable Construction MaterialsIn the wake of an international recession, many countries, including the United States, are creating an initiative to boost construction jobs. There are plenty of post-industrial sites around the developed world which need to be rebuilt, and much like the call for sustainable energy sources, governments and consumers alike are calling for greener building materials.Green construction is currently a $36-billion industry, and it is expected to grow an additional 10% by 2020.This industry depends heavily on consumer demand, and may have an even greater outlook with increased government regulations and successful marketing.8. Cyber Fraud DetectionWhere there’s an opportunity to make a quick buck, be sure that there are criminals out there concocting a plan. The trend of doing business and keeping sensitive information on computers will increase, and so will the demand for protection against cyber criminals.Businesses and individuals alike will require protection from cyber fraud for the foreseeable future, but in the next 5 years, this industry is expected to grow over 12% annually.9. DronesDrone technology is new, but the potential for application in a variety of other industries including agriculture, the military, and parcel delivery have already caught the attention of investors. This creates an excellent opportunity in the market to expand research and development of drones, making them more viable with each in iteration. With a projected annual growth of almost 17% annually until 2022, very little is likely to stifle the growth of this industry.10. SiliconRelated to the demand for solar panels, silicon has also been a slowly but steadily growing market in the past decades. In addition to solar panels, silicon is also required to make electronics and building materials, which you may notice are also on this list. For this reason, experts expect to see silicon’s demand increase in the coming years as other industries take hold.These 10 industries show tremendous potential in 2016 and beyond, indicating a future of environmental consciousness and an even greater focus on electronics and AI.",UNKNOWN,Kai-Fu Lee,641,0,0,2017,https://www.quora.com/If-all-software-is-free-except-Microsoft-Windows-is-there-any-hope-for-a-for-profit-industry-that-will-emerge-out-of-information-technology

This very well could change how we live. Right now if you want an engineering job, publishing job or big law job you have to live in an expensive urban area. If you could cut that down to having to go to your office once a week I see two different things happening at once. People can start living farther away which might reduce the cost of living in the heart of a city but it will increase the cost of living farther away and cause smaller areas to have to provide more services to people staying home.The other change I see is automation of low-level low experience jobs. For example right now self-checkouts and online ordering is cutting into the number of cashiers that are being employed. Other than answering questions, much of what happens in a store for example can be automated. The first thing is this eliminates one path for teens to start into the workforce. This automation likely makes it harder for the small business to complete in some ways.",17 followers,Fabius Fairchild,1.8K,0,0,2021,https://www.quora.com/Which-three-emerging-technologies-will-affect-the-world-the-most-in-the-next-100-years-and-why
