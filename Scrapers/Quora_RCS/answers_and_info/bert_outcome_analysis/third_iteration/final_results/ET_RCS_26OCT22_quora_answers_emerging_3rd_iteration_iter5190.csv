Are you now two people at once? Does that even make sense?Now, let’s do another one. Let’s slowly replace your neurons one-by-one with silicon chips or whatever, something artifical, until your brain is totally replaced with a computer. Is it still you? If the person in the first thought experiment wasn’t you, then the one in this thought experiment isn’t you, either. The fact that there’s no precise transition point doesn’t matter; if I destroy your neurons one by one until you have none leftThis is where philosophical dilettantes will roll their eyes and say they don’t have the time for this kind of minutiae, as if I’m being pedantic. Unfortunately, this is just a lack of rigor on their part. If you’re gonna claim to have this advanced understanding of things, then you need to actually think it through. If you don’t, then you’re just an intellectual poser. And thinking this point through brings out a fairly obvious conclusion.","2,228 followers",Fabian van den Berg,13K,1.2K,4M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Could-we-in-principle-slowly-replace-our-brains-with-technology-and-still-maintain-the-stability-of-our-mind-s-identity

Right back to the pre-Socratics it’s been clear that identity doesn’t really hold up as a concept one you stare at it closely enough. It’s good enough for most everyday things, but even for human minds we’re prone to saying things like “I’m not the same person I was 20 years ago” and mean it. Much less “You’re not the same person when you’re taking methamphetamine” or “He’s not the same person he was before that“We” may persist indefinitely once technology has the capacity to outdo us, in a if-humans-why-still-monkeys sense. And I don’t mean that pejoratively: people are perfectly good at being people, and there’s no reason people can’t coexist in a world with computer-enhanced-former-people.But those computer-enhanced-former-people thing will almost certainly ditch identity, just as “Quora” isn’t identical to the laptop upon which Quora 0.01beta ran. You can no longer identify Quora with any computer, or with any specific piece of software, in theIf this is a problem it’s only because of our insistence that our notion of identity is important.

2,"I like this comment and I have been thinking about this lately. This idea of whether a continuation of mind, which is seemingly a emergent property of the collective activity of an interconnected network, could be maintained if each component part was replaced bit by bit. This reminds me of the Ship of Theseus paradox: If a ship is replaced part by part over time until all of the parts have been replaced, is it the same ship? Is there any evidence that this is possible for the human brain?

This reminds me of the Ship of Theseus paradox: If a ship is replaced part by part over time until all of the parts have been replaced, is it the same ship? Is there any evidence that this is possible for the human brain? In other words, as Caleb described, could we, bit by bit, replace the brain with a synthetic replica while maintaining the continuity of mind? Is there any evidence that this is possible from what we understand of biology and neuroscience, even if it is not a practical reality? Although neurogenesis occurs into adulthood, the neurons in your brain and CNS you possessed in your youth are the same as those that you will have when you are aged. There is largely no turnover. However, the neurons and glia within the brain (and therefore the mind) are comprised of components which (like all cells) are undoing continuous replacement and recycling at both the atomic and molecular level (proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids). For example, some studies have shown that the average half-life of a sample of proteins in the brain is ~9 days (in mice). A similar phenomenon is undoubtedly happening in the human brain. What this means is that your brain is likely comprised of completely different components at different points in your life, despite the neurons and their interconnections being largely maintained. So with this concept, we can now circle back to the question of whether it is possible for a continuity of ‘mind’ if the brain is replaced bit by bit. Despite this process of continuous recycling, we have, at the very least, a perception that our mind has continuity over time (perhaps this is not the case, but we are simply limited in our abilitiy to perceive this change). Regardless, this may demonstrate that, bit by bit replacement of our brain with sythetics is not necessarily impossibile, even if it is not a practical idea.","44,314 followers",Kurt Guntheroth,1.4K,13.7K,167.3M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Could-we-in-principle-slowly-replace-our-brains-with-technology-and-still-maintain-the-stability-of-our-mind-s-identity

And the same applies to uploading your consciousness to a computer. That won’t be you. But computer will believe that it is you. And some other people will also believe it.UPDATEFrom comments:Do you have any evidence that supports your theory?That’s a tough part for me. One of the evidences is that scientists didn’t find a physical structure representing a self in a brain. Therefore a self is being created by a brain, it’s an informational pattern. But informational patterns aren’t constant. For example, you may have a thought — “apple”. Then you stop thinking it. Where does it go? A thought “apple” isn’t stored somewhere in a brain: It just disappears. And then when you think “apple” again that thought is being generated. The same is with a self. It isn’t constant.If that's the case, then what's the point of making plans for the future if it's not going to be you experiencing them?That’s how we’re wired. If we don’t believe that we will be we in the future we won’t do anything for ourselves, and we won’t survive. We are programmed by evolution to believe that a self is constant and unchanging. And also there is a social factor. Believing in one constant and unchanging self makes moral responsibility possible.Wouldn't knowing that make you go insane?Yeah, it was actually one of the reasons of my existential crisis.

And it turns out that worker productivity increase is correlated with wage increases and a growing workforce.
