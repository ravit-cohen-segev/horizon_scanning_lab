1,"No.I’m going to give my own example to explain why. So, you don’t have to look me up. I’ve been in EMS since 1995, a Paramedic since 2001, and a flight Paramedic since 2005.Last year I had a nosebleed. Now, when I say nosebleed I mean I lost a liter of blood out of my nose. I couldn’t control it enough to drive. I couldn’t control it enough to call a cab. So, I was mortified, but I called 911. Now these are the local fire/rescue guys and I have quite literally been considered enough of an expert that I have taught classes for them despite not being a part of their academy cadre.

Now these are the local fire/rescue guys and I have quite literally been considered enough of an expert that I have taught classes for them despite not being a part of their academy cadre. I tried to explain what what going on but the 911 script was such that I was sent an ALS response. Again, I was mortified. I had an engine company and a medic unit show up for a nosebleed. I apologized profusely and the medic and I kinda laughed because I had become “everything I hate by calling a medic unit for a nosebleed.”It turns out that I was having a hypertensive crisis. I had a nosebleed because I had a BP of 300/150. Had the vessels in my nose not worked as a “pop off valve” and blown in a desperate attempt to reduce the pressure then I probably would have stroked out and died before I ever had a chance to call 911.The lesson from that is that the algorithms are written that way to send you what you need based on past data. While they are sometimes wrong, they are often not. I was an acknowledged expert as a Paramedic with 23 (at the time) years of experience and I would have asked for the wrong thing.So, in my opinion, no, you should not be able to decide what emergency services arrive when you call 911. You may not be thinking correctly. The algorithm that was developed based on calls similar to yours is more likely to be correct than you are. It will be safer for both you and the responders.","220,624 followers",Franklin Veaux,694,47.3K,783M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-do-you-want-emergency-responders-to-be-capable-of-doing-in-10-years-with-the-help-of-technology
2,"We still pay. And we’ve all learned to carry cash to restaurants.There’s a particular Chinese buffet restaurant that’s very popular with my fellow volunteers. The buffet and free soda refills make it easy to prepay the meal. Plus the staff understands that sometimes we have to make a dash for the exit.A few winters ago, a few of us were sitting at that restaurant when as soon as we sat down, we got a call to head out. Oh well. We came back the next night and a manager came running over blabbering a string of words in a dialect of Chinese that I didn’t recognize. My counterpart and I were lookiWe still pay.

3,"Seriously? In a country where owning guns is a right guaranteed by the Constitution, and the enormous number of guns in circulation it is ridiculous to expect an armed police force to go away. Plus, unarmed emergency responders simply stay away from or evacuate from areas where criminals shoot at or attack them. There is no reason that an unarmed person should be expected to replace the armed police that we have.While there is the need for police reform in many departments, not all police are bad cops. Better to fix what is broken than to toss it out.",2 followers,Richard Muller,3.2K,2.3K,202.3M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-do-you-want-emergency-responders-to-be-capable-of-doing-in-10-years-with-the-help-of-technology
4,"I learned this years ago from a Flight Attendant who literally sat in the back of a plane near me and chatted it up, and I thought we were flirting, only for her to tell me she had a boyfriend at the end of the flight.She was a tease or I was a guy misreading the signs. Probably the latter :):|When these masks drop down.They aren’t actually connected to oxygen tanks.Those masks have a tube of chemicals connected to them.

It’s not easy to organize fragmented data from multiple sources. To operate efficiently, you’ll need well-curated and timely operations.In a recent study, an estimated $3 trillion goes down the drain annually due to bad data. Therefore, it’s quite imperative that you address this problem early as a company. Luckily, CDPs help to solve this problem by collecting data from all sources. They then organize it, tag it, and make it usable.Device Form FactorsThe current customer needs include small, light, and effective devices. Therefore, manufacturers are heading to the call by providing hybrid devices that double up as phones and tablets. For instance, the Samsung Galaxy Fold 2 does this quite well. 2021 will see a return of stronger and more efficient folding and unfolding devices.Quantum ComputingQuantum computing has helped in the management of COVID-19 in terms of managing the spread, looking for possible vaccines, and the development of therapeutics. As people continue to realize the power of quantum computing, we are more likely to witness its application in many industries in 2021 and beyond.Anywhere OperationsThis IT operating model supports customers everywhere. It also enables employees anywhere in addition to enabling the deployment of business services across distributed infrastructure.Internet of Behaviors(IoB)IoB is an upcoming trend that you’ll hear more of in 2021. Companies and businesses are taking advantage of technology to monitor consumer and customer behaviors. Some of the effective technological tools here include location tracking big data and facial recognition.According to a prediction by Gartner, more than half of the global population will be under an IoB tool by 2025.Total ExperienceOften abbreviated as TX, the total experience goes side by side with the customer experience, user experience, and employee experience. As most of the interactions today are virtual, distributed, and mobile, it’s important to use the TX strategy even more.Already, the COVID-19 pandemic has forced a new norm in collaborations. And that’s why you need to bring together the customers and employees. Intelligent Composable BusinessThis trend focuses on taking advantage of packaged business capabilities. You can develop it through vendors or do it in-house. ICB helps to bring different things together, including better access to changing data, better decision making, and application delivery.Hybrid CloudMost businesses are moving towards the hybrid cloud model. The reason is simple – the hybrid cloud is more convenient. It helps businesses to strike a balance for their distinct cloud infrastructural needs.Most of the giant public cloud providers have started focusing on the hybrid cloud. Some of them include Google Cloud,Oracle, and IBM. All of this aims at dealing with different customer challenges including:Privacy and Confidential ComputingIt involves the encryption of the entire computing process and not only the data. This creates extra layers of security that help to protect sensitive information. We should expect more of privacy and confidential computing in action come 2021.Smart Work from Home TechnologiesThe coronavirus pandemic has shifted the way we do things and carry out business. Initially, it would be radical to allow employees to work from home on a large scale. Even when employees were asking for enhanced work flexibility, it was never to be.The current lockdowns have led to the common acceptance of the work from home formulas. And many pundits argue that this work-from-home policy will outlast the pandemic. We have seen many tech giants extending the work from home flexibility to their staff. Some like Twitter have even given their employees the option of working from home entirely for the rest of their working careers.Part of what made all this a reality is the deployment of smart work from home tools such as WebEx, Zoom, and Microsoft Teams. Such apps have witnessed massive usage over the past few months, and this is expected to continue even in 2021.Artificial IntelligenceAI has continued to improve operations for many companies and businesses. The pandemic even made its usage more common. AI, data, and machine learning have played an unmatched role during this coronavirus period.We have seen how AI has helped in the suggestions customers get when shopping on Amazon, or even when they are watching movies on Netflix. More companies will benefit from AI since the cloud continues to enable access to the rising computing power, software, and frameworks. It’s estimated that 45% of companies using artificial intelligence have increased their total spend per customer, and their ASPs.Hope you like Article.",0 followers,Lucas Martin,6.4K,65,4.2M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-do-you-want-emergency-responders-to-be-capable-of-doing-in-10-years-with-the-help-of-technology

So, at first glance, with the COVID-19 still impacting the country, it may not seem like the right time to take on new challenges. In some cases, however, it is beneficial, if not essential.For many workers and some business owners, existing and new technologies including chatbots, machine learning, artificial intelligence (AI) and others are seen as a threat. But most workplaces actually leverage tech to advance the employees and their capabilities, especially now. Where would we be the current remote-work environment without platforms like Zoom, Dropbox, and Slack?Your job, then: embrace technology and embrace the change that comes with. Doing that to the fullest extent means preparing yourself and building your skillset. Here is where to start.#1. Make the most of your current techAs a start, make sure you have a good working knowledge of the day-to-day tools and systems necessary in your position. Then look to maximize the potential of those items. In most cases there is much more that can be done with what you have. Have you taken the time to understand all the key features and potential of your company’s primary communication platform? Does your firm already use Chatbots in some areas? See if they might be helpful in your department. Use your LinkedIn account for more than just job searches and business development - use it to follow key influencers and stay current on trends and developments in your industry.#2. Utilize technologies not yet at your company but that are working in your industryIf you are a property manager, what are your goals? Reduce vacancies, ensure properties are well maintained and find solutions to tenant grievances, for starters. Even basic PropTech can be a game changer in improving these areas in an industry like real estate which has been slow to adapt to technology. See what the proven opportunities are in your industry - the people driving improvement will always find themselves in demand.#3 Identify Trends Before They HappenThe more you know about trending technologies, the more agile you will find yourself when you need to respond. Search out new technologies that will specifically meet customer needs by improving service and cost efficiencies. Pioneer them whenever possible – brand yourself as a Change Agent and Technology Sherpa.Once you start watching emerging trends, you will give yourself time to, at the very least, identify your own role in a changing economy. However, more likely, you will find a way to add additional value to your business and to your end-customers. Put in a little work, and you will soon find yourself offering ideas that could fundamentally transform your career trajectory or the success of your business.","117,498 followers",Sheryl Sandberg,1.1K,0,0,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-do-you-want-emergency-responders-to-be-capable-of-doing-in-10-years-with-the-help-of-technology
