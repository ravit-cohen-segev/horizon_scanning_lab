Philippe Schyns, professor of psychology at Glasgow University’s Centre for Cognitive Neuroimaging, said the discovery is a huge step up in interpreting brain activity, creating opportunities to study how brain networks change with age or disease, and raising the possibility of developing “robot vision”.Now tell me who is going to win the race that never ends?????",2 followers,Himanshu Chavhan,20.4K,71,659.6K,2016,https://www.quora.com/If-technology-is-the-barrier-to-competition-why-giants-who-hired-top-talent-making-technology-cant-dont-win

Analog FM radio broadcasting signals can now have as many as three digital subchannels available for listeners who own the right receiving equipment.

4,"I learned about blockchain in 2012, from the man who nearly burned my apartment down.He was supposed to cat-sit while my wife and I honeymooned in Thailand.

They bend and twist the truth in the way that most suits the needs of their clients.But this blockchain, it was something else.“This is the first time in history we can verify that something happened at a definitive point in time without depending on an intermediary,” I thought.Until then, records of transactions had to be kept with a 3rd party and would be suspect to tampering. But with blockchain, trust is safely spread out.Another way to look at is by understanding the Byzantine Generals’ Problem. Several armies surround a city. If they all attack at the same time, they can triumph. If they all retreat at the same time, they can save themselves.But anything in between, and there’ll be death. A lot of it.It’s the fundemantal human problem of trust. One general can tell the others that he’ll be attacking, but they can’t know it for a fact until they themselves either attack or retreat.Blockchain, on the other hand, is a public ledger recording transactions with timestamps on a vastly distributed network of computers. If one person decides to tell a different story, they won’t be able to.Too many records on too many nodes will prevent that.Revolutionary.Blockchain naysayers aren’t rare.When email was invented, they said it’s too impersonal and people would never use it. Phone companies used to state that no one would ever communicate over anything but a phone line. Traditional media believed banner ads wouldn't be effective in comparison with printed ads.They were all wrong.And here’s the point.Blockchain is already powering technologies that are transforming our livesIn healthcare, it’s being used to track the progress of patients after they leave the hospital. In finance, cryptocurrencies allow for effecting payments in a non-centralized way and without the control of central governments. Smart contracts are changing how we do business and reducing bureaucratic hoops. Precious gems are being monitored to ensure they’re free of child labor and tyranny. Even governments are using blockchain to increase efficiency.How wide-ranging will blockchain’s implications be?Stick around and you’ll find out.","84,918 followers",Adam Fayed,18.5K,3.6K,476.4M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-best-blockchains-to-invest-in-2021

8,"This is the top turret for a B-17.While it’s enclosed, that’s providing no protection to the gunner from bullets or fragmentation: it’s merely a Perspex bubble to keep the 200-knot airstream over the turret off him, and to streamline the turret so that it wasn’t being forced off the gunner’s aim by that airflow.Putting a roof-mounted gun on a vehicle like a HMMWV is straightforward - here’s a M2HB fit.The gunner’s exposed, which is an issue (though the vehicle itself isn’t massively protected) - but no more so than on the B-17 except that he’ll get wet when it rains.If you want more protectionThis is the top turret for a B-17.While it’s enclosed, that’s providing no protection to the gunner from bullets or fragmentation: it’s merely a Perspex bubble to keep the 200-knot airstream over the turret off him, and to streamline the turret so that it wasn’t being forced off the gunner’s aim by that airflow.Putting a roof-mounted gun on a vehicle like a HMMWV is straightforward - here’s a M2HB fit.The gunner’s exposed, which is an issue (though the vehicle itself isn’t massively protected) - but no more so than on the B-17 except that he’ll get wet when it rains.If you want more protection, you can - and the US have - done something like this.The problem there, is that you’ve not only added quite a bit of weight (ballistic protection all around, and overhead, for the gunner) but it’s on top of the vehicle. This not only reduces payload and performance, but makes the vehicle top-heavy and less able to cope with sloped ground without a risk of rolling over.There wasn’t ever a technology issue - the problem was that when armed HMMWVs were first arriving, they expected to be half a mile or more from the enemy providing fire with HMGs or TOW, not up close and personal in small-arms range.Partly it’s the shift in emphasis from all-out warfighting (where firepower and mobility was more important) to discretional operations (where low casualties were more important) - after all, at the point that bombers had enclosed (if unarmoured) turrets, we were using vehicles like this:-Not a lot of protection to be seen there, but the Long Range Desert Group did manage some successes despite the lack of armour plate.",19 followers,Paul Adam,950,4.2K,44.6M,2020,https://www.quora.com/If-technology-is-the-barrier-to-competition-why-giants-who-hired-top-talent-making-technology-cant-dont-win
9,"It wasn’t a question of technology, just of doctrine. Army divisions were designed for attacking other Army divisions not for an occupation. I ran one of the Army Camps in Kuwait during the invasion in 2003. The only armor in the attacking force that went into Iraq where Tanks and Bradleys for American units. We did have an MP unit that had armored HMMWVs but they were the only ones. They didn’t start operating until after the taking of Bagdad. At first they mostly were escorting HETs, which are the REALY big Army transports that move equipment.

The HET drivers didn’t like the escorts because the HETs could drive for 12 hours where as the HMMWV needed fuel after 8, so the HMMWVs slowed them down. The IEDs started evolving that summer and that’s when the huge need for convoy escorts became apparent. The Army just didn’t have them and hadn’t planned for it. They did start making more and they eventually evolved to have gun turrets etc. Before that units were just making and applying there own armor.
