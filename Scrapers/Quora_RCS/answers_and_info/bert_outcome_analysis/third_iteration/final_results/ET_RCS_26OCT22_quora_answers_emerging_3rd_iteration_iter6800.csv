The fact that so many modern tasks involve writing is indeed responsible for society going haywire, and we see evidence all around us every day.And I say this as a professional writer who makes a living from writing books.First, yes, it is incontrovertible that far more tasks today involve writing than at any other point in history. Not only is literacy at an all-time high all around the world, in most Western societies literacy is assumed as part of the basic cost of entry for participating in civic life.Not only that, but basic tasks that 200, 400, 500 years ago would nit have required any writing at all now assume literacy as a basic prerequisite. Even an enormous quantity of social interaction—like what goes on right here on the Internet!—requires writing.Now, all that literacy has unquestionably sent society into a deep spiraling dive.War is at an all-time low for the last…well, for all of recorded human history, really.More people as a percentage of the population today live in participatory representational states than in the past. Slavery is no longer legally endorsed in nearly any society (which is not to say it doesn’t happen, of course, but it isn’t a sanctioned part of the overwhelming majority of modern societies).If you compare the world today with the world of the past, society has inarguably gone haywire. No feudal serf states! Fewer wars! No Black Plague! Incredibly low infant mortality from a historical perspective!

The health effects are too severe even if not fatal.As for colonies (I prefer calling the settlements for obvious reasons), we won’t be ready for 50–100 years for that — unless we see some amazing breakthroughs first. A permanent science base on Mars is not a colony nor a settlement because people do not spend their lives there raising families and playing with their grandchildren.Suppose that we can build a settlement on Mars by 2100. Who will finance this venture? Unless the world has a surplus and few in poverty, we have more important things to do with our resources. Unless settlements on Mars have a payback for investors, society must decide to underwrite this activity for unclear reasons. There’s really only one. It’s the reason we financed visits to our two poles — exploration.Once we have a settlement on Mars, several engineering advances will be required before we can even consider flying humans to the stars. These will be so difficult that it may well take until 2200 before humans can begin planning for a trip to the nearest habitable (at least as habitable as Mars) exoplanet. Those plans, including a robotic mission to the planet, may take another century to reach fulfillment. Add on another century to make the trip, and we could see our first interstellar settlement around 2400.That is so far into the future, that my guesses above could be far, far off. I am only attempting to suggest the most rational guesses that I can see. Others will see things differently, I am sure. Few things are certain about the future. I think that human nature will continue to push for exploration. I know that all travel and communication will be constrained by the speed of light. Travel will be doing extremely well to reach one-tenth of that speed.I also guess that human lifespans will have been extended to beyond 200 years by 2300 so that a one-hundred-year journey will not require a multi-generational ship. I hope that some sort of pseudo-hibernation technology will allow passengers to spend most of the trip sleeping with much-slowed aging.I have previously listed many of the new technologies required for interstellar travel and will not repeat myself here.

They should, pretty much everything is a hand me down from the Space Shuttle program, right up to using actual spare RS-25 Shuttle main engines that were flown on a Shuttle.Now it may seem bizarre doing this, but there are good reasons for doing so. The Space Shuttle main engines still hold the record for the best specific impulse (Isp) of any chemical engine ever flown, giving them the highest possible efficiency for the job. The solid fuel boosters (SRBs) that mount on either side offer huge thrust and are easy to build (admittedly at the cost of poor efficiency), and the best bit is that it’s all well established technology that has been in use for several decades under the STS program, and has a mature manufacturing base behind it.On the surface it sounds like the perfect way to build a kick arse system very cheaply and reliably, since everything is well understood and established. Congress loved the idea since it keeps aerospace factories manned up and working in key states, and a happy workforce are votes in the hand. The only fly in the ointment is the rather uncomfortable fact that Boeing (the actual company building the vehicle) seems to require around two billion dollars for the first example, which is inexplicably several years behind schedule. So far NASA has spent the best part of $9 billion on this system without a single flight as of yet.Another uncomfortable fact is that there is nothing reusable about the SLS. The beautiful RS-25 main engines that were reflown with every Shuttle flight will be expended on the SLS, hell, even the SRBs will not be recovered in this new application, unlike the old STS ones which were.Basically, what we have here is a Space Shuttle without the orbiter, which gives it a huge lift capacity (95 tonnes to LEO to start with), but at the same high cost as the Space Shuttle with none of the reusability. Flight cadence will be restricted to how fast Boeing can construct them, which doesn’t fill people with confidence considering how far behind they have run so far. At the moment the SLS really looks like a “jobs for the boys” project, authorised by a cynical Congress in order to retain their seats.NASA are quite happy to run with the system since it allows them to shoot for the moon again, and gives them something to launch their own baby, the Orion Crew Capsule. NASA has been been working on and developing this with Lockheed Martin for the last 14 years at an eye watering cost of $18.7 billion, and the vehicle is envisioned as a true deep space craft that could be used for interplanetary work.Right now, NASA is committed to project Artemis, and as of right now, the only way to get the Orion into cislunar space is with the SLS (which we are assured by Boeing will be ready…… um soon,A combination of both the SpaceX Falcon Heavy and ULA Vulcan systems would require more launches, but would save NASA billions.",0 followers,Mr G,2.4K,462,1.8M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-would-our-society-look-like-if-technology-has-evolved-to-such-a-point-where-daily-tasks-are-automated

Today English is the unchallenged lingua franca of science, but this was not always the case.Back then the dominant language was not English, but in many areas of natural science it was German. The most extreme example among these is probably chemistry. If you studied chemistry at the beginning of 20th century, then you also had to study German. Period. You could forget English, completely forget it. There was no way around it. Either you started learning German, or no chemistry at all.If we compare, for example, Germany and the USA in the number of awarded science Nobel prizes, then we can see that it took the USA 20 years, mass immigration of specialists, a lost world war for Germany, a complete breakdown of the German scientific sector, the division of the country, a gigantic German brain drain to achieve 1965 parity with Germany.Or based on more general terms, the use of language.
