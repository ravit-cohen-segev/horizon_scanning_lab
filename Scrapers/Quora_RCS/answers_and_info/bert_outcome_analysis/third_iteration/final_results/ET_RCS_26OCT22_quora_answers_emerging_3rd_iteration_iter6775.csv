0,"It has actually changed more than you would think. 30 years ago we where still mostly designing plane on Mylar, all hand drawn. Today it is all done with CAD systems. The upshot is dramatically reduced weight of the plane, almost eliminating use of shims to better tolerances. We have the glass cockpit eliminating all the gauges. The use of light weight composites instead of aluminum. The elimination of the bleed air system in most if not all newer designed planes, another weight reduction. We are starting to see the use of fiber optics also which again reduces the weight of the plane.There areIt has actually changed more than you would think. 30 years ago we where still mostly designing plane on Mylar, all hand drawn.

4,"It was Pretend. Nothing in that movie was realistic in terms of actual submarine tactics, weapons or thought processes by actual submarine officers.I Served as a Cold War junior officer and later Combat systems department head on two attack submarines. I lived through real missions in the real Cold War.My entire wardroom went to see the movie at the Honolulu movie plex.

Nothing in that movie was realistic in terms of actual submarine tactics, weapons or thought processes by actual submarine officers.I Served as a Cold War junior officer and later Combat systems department head on two attack submarines. I lived through real missions in the real Cold War.My entire wardroom went to see the movie at the Honolulu movie plex. COMSUBPAC (Commander Submarines Pacific fleet) had rented the entire theater for opening night and invited all the officers and their spouses to a night out. We all dressed in dinner dress whites and our wife wore ball gowns and ate at restaurants throughout Waikiki. It was a blast to dine and dance in Waikiki dressed to the hilt.The next day at officers' call at 6:30 am, we all gathered in the wardroom, the Captain came in, said good morning. Then turned to the XO and said ( something like)“ XO- if I ever give you command over my ship so I can go to another ship and you drive her into the path of a torpedo I will kill you! “. We all laughed and then he said “ no way I’d ever leave you in charge!” And we all laughed.His point was this:No Captain is going to ever leave his/ her ship for some mission away from the ship- ever. Captains always believe their first priority is the vessel and send others to leave ( like Picard and never like Kirk).My captain had absolute faith in our XO and we knew it but it was his command he worked for 18 years to get it and wasn’t going to leave her.We all knew that a torpedo is a very dangerous and lethal weapon and you don’t recklessly get in their path and have complete faith in a NAU (noisemaker) to protect you, NAUs don't work that way, and a Torpedos intercept speed and ranges far exceeds a ship’s creating a very high degree of likelihood of intercept and death. To turn from and open range from incoming weapons and drive to get clear of the cone- you cannot outrun it.All the ranges displayed were absurdly close in real submarine encounter there are miles between shipsSubmarines have nowhere near the positional certainty of incoming torpedoes, ranges to them, and it was shown as if sonar gives you the same situational understanding as seeing - it does not. It gives you a bearing, a bearing rate, and you rely on charting it on paper, known limits, and ships maneuvers to understand.No Sonar shack is one man. It is a team and a ton of computers, sonar without fire control is only half the battle, there was no sonar man like Jonesy. ( I qualified all sonar watchstanders for my second ship as CSO ) and sonar doesn’t work at all like they showed.Both as a junior officer, and as a department head ( who used to force the Junior officers to get their sonar checkouts from me) because an Officer of the Deck who doesn’t really know sonar is just useless, I fervently forced officers to really understand sonar and how to read the raw data and work with the sonar supervisor. You never blindly trusted them, you were always glued to the ASVIDU (the screen in control that allowed the OOD to see all 8 screens from the BQQ5c suite)","2,430 followers",Larry Ciummo,1.2K,3.4K,27.6M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Has-the-technology-for-manufacturing-commercial-planes-evolved-in-last-30-years-or-so

6,"Let’s ask ourselves if there’s some sort of scientific experiment or observation we could make to address this question.Well, my grandmother was born more than a hundred years ago. I’m pretty sure she was of the same species as the humans who are living now. Therefore, there has been no obvious “evolutionary progress” in the last hundred years.If only there were some way to compare technology a hundred years ago to technology today, then we could answer the question of whether technology can “continue to evolve” without biological “evolutionary progress”.","8,303 followers",Untorne Nislav,1.5K,325,4M,2017,https://www.quora.com/Has-the-technology-for-manufacturing-commercial-planes-evolved-in-last-30-years-or-so

No one knows how much it’s going to cost, and I can guarantee that the price quotes these “printer companies” are giving you are way, way too low.The biggest problem is that you have to put steel reinforcement in concrete to give it strength. No one has a printer yet that can do that - it’s all done manually and then the cost is hand-waved away. That’s not speculation either, I’ve literally talked to people who said, “we didn’t include the labor to operate the printer because we expect that to be automated in the future.”There’s also no real investigation being done on the properties of the printed concrete, so we have absolutely no idea how adequate any of the designs are. In fact, for most research groups the mixture of the concrete changes pretty frequently, so it’s going to be quite a while before we actually know how strong and durable the stuff is.Everything you see news about right now is a prototype in a long development chain, and trying to cost-account a prototype of thi...","3,412 followers",Louis Vaught,1.4K,1.2K,13.5M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Has-the-technology-for-manufacturing-commercial-planes-evolved-in-last-30-years-or-so
