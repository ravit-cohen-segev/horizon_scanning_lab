I think the reason for that is, because the industry are so huge and deeply controlled by the rich and powerful and very political that it will take a long time for cryptocurrencies to have an impact here, while it will probably go much faster in the ones ranked lower (Gaming, Adult, Gambling, Ticketing).it looks like the Top 7 has the biggest potential, but will take the most time while the bottom 7 has a smaller market, but will make an impact much faster.Some of these blockchain have already found usage and we can expect for some of them to become the standard worldwide in several industries.Here, you have a few more use cases in a nice infographic.If you found this post helpful, please give an upvote. :)","31,157 followers",Phillip Remaker,1.7K,11K,78.8M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Why-is-blockchain-different-than-existing-technologies-What-makes-it-stand-out-as-an-emerging-tech-trend
