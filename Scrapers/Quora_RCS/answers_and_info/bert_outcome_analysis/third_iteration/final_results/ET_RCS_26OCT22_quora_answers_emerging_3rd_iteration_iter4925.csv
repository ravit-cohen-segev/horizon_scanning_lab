0,"A phone camera has an aperture of perhaps 3 millimeters. That means if the lens and sensor are perfect, it can achieve 167 microradians of resolution.Consider a DSLR with a 2000 mm focal length lens. It can resolve 2 microradians.OK, so you don’t know what that means. I grabbed my phone camera and my 12 year old modest DSLR with kit lens and took a picture under good conditions. Hand held.Cell phone.DSLR. So far, so good. But let’s take a closer look.I zoomed in on the sign in the picture. This is what the cellphone did. It has 32 megapixels.I did the same digital zoom with my DSLR. Mind you,A phone camera has an aperture of perhaps 3 millimeters.

It has 32 megapixels.I did the same digital zoom with my DSLR. Mind you, it only has 18 megapixels. There are a couple of take aways here. With the tiny lens, all those megapixels do not get you a clearer picture. And the cellphone picture is very highly processed to look sharper when it just doesn’t have the detail you would expect from so many pixels. If you are really sharp you will notice that the DSLR did not automatically hide the chromatic aberration in the above picture. That is something usually done in post processing on the computer.Now, I just rotated my zoom lens to a longer focal length and took another picture.You still think that a cellphone image matches up to a DSLR?Look at this building in the cell phone.It’s pretty unrecognizable and the phone went basically to black and white.Here is the DSLR. Can you argue that the cell phone is anywhere near professional quality when we are comparing to a new phone to a twelve-year-old starter DSLR APS-C frame with a kit lens? A flagship Canon full frame DSLR with a prime lens would blow even the bottom picture away. By the way, I did not do any processing on the DSLR images and I have the camera set for minimal sharpening and minimal noise reduction and output jpeg files. If I had taken raw images into Photoshop, the difference would be another quantum leap.Or, in other words, if all you ever want to do is take snapshots for social media, your cellphone is all you need. Wait until balloon fiesta and I’ll show you some comparison photos.I am actually a little surprised that the phone camera came as close as it did. The thing third from left in top row is a balloon gondola shape. The green and black thing is a German screwdriver.Image credit:",5 followers,Bill Otto,7.6K,7.5K,43.3M,2022,https://www.quora.com/Do-you-think-that-voice-activation-technology-will-replace-smartphones
