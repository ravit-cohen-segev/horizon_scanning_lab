Or the books are research for a podcast that I forget immediately after I do a podcast.So I can say a lot of books have changed my life. Books I read yesterday changed my life today.These are the 40 books that changed my life.But I have to go back to age 15, when I was pimply and scared and shy and afraid and beginning to learn the mythology of failure.The book that saved me was “Illusions: Adventures of a Reluctant Messiah” by Richard Bach, who was also the author of the classic “Jonathan Livingston Seagull”.I reread this book quite a bit. Maybe once a year.Here’s what I learned:Don’t take yourself too seriously. Don’t take other people too seriously. Don’t take the sun, and the moon, and the stars so seriously.Life is about freedom. Seriousness chains you. Be light. Be caring. Be good. Then there are less things to be serious about.What happens when you are free from the illusion?Magic happens. Coincidences happen. More things are funny. And laughter extends life.When you are not so serious, you realize there are more people worth of love.Meaning is joy. Meaning is “sleep soundly at night”.How stupid we are: insignificant brats that came 15 billion years late to the party and think we know something.Hence, “Illusions” - respect for the mystery of it all. Be bewildered. Be confused. Be a wanderer. Explore.We’re all reluctant messiahs.I was 15, scarred from cysts, parents that ignored me, bullies that beat on me so much I wouldn’t go to the cafeteria or bathroom during school hours, I’d cut school to wander around in crime-stricken bankrupt New York City. It was safer than being at school.But it was an illusion. And I was free. I hope I always keep that feeling of freedom that was gifted to me by that one book I read when I was 15.Related Post:",3 followers,Renuka Rajendran,670,82,762.4K,2017,https://www.quora.com/How-does-one-learn-about-the-best-upcoming-technology-books

Since the development of the digital computer in the 1940s, it has been demonstrated that computers can be programmed to carry out very complex tasks—as, for example, discovering proofs for mathematical theorems or playing chess —with great proficiency. Still, despite continuing advances in computer processing speed and memory capacity, there are as yet no programs that can match human flexibility over wider domains or in tasks requiring much everyday knowledge. On the other hand, some programs have attained the performance levels of human experts and professionals in performing certain specific tasks, so that artificial intelligence in this limited sense is found in applications a diverse as medical diagnosis, computer search engines, and voice or handwriting recognition.What is the purpose of artificial intelligence?The traditional problems (or goals) of research include reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception and the ability to move and manipulate objects.

There are even survival guides that warn us that we must start putting strategies in place to profit rather than perish when the inevitable happens.

The Dugards had relocated to Meyers because they knew it to be a safer neighborhood than where they had lived previously. She was walking to school on her usual route and nothing seemed amiss.By 1991, Phillip Garrido had already committed several crimes and had a history of kidnapping. He had kidnapped Katherine Callaway in 1976, holding her hostage in an abandoned warehouse. When he was found and arrested, police diagnosed him as a “sexual deviant and chronic drug abuser.” He admitted to masturbating to elementary school girls in his car frequently. All of this led to a 50-year prison sentence in 1977.There, he met his future wife Nancy, who would later be his accomplice in crime. They married in prison in 1981. By 1988, the two were both released from prison on parole. Phillip was heavily monitored, wearing a GPS bracelet on his ankle and being frequently inspected by parole officers.On that fateful day in June, Jaycee was walking on the sidewalk when a car pulled up beside her. She believed the man inside was asking for directions and walked up to the open window. Suddenly, Phillip pulled out a stun gun and shocked her unconscious. Nancy helped him haul her limp body into the back seat of the car.After a three-hour drive, she was brought out of the car into an unfamiliar backyard. Phillip began asking her to take off her clothes, but she couldn’t understand why this strange man would ask her to do that. Before she could do more than utter a few words, however, Phillip was forcefully stripping off her clothes: all of them. He then brought her inside to shower with him, grabbing a razor and forcefully shaving her genitals.“See this?” Phillip says as he pulls off his pants.“Make it grow.”After this, Phillip put a pair of handcuffs on Jaycee’s wrists and brought her into a tiny little shed in the backyard. This was where she was to live from now on. Phillip came in a few times a day to bring food and water or empty the chamber pot which she had as a toilet, but other than that, there was only Jaycee and the handcuffs in that hot, sweltering shed.Periodically, Phillip came into the shed in a more agitated mood. Jaycee would come to realize that this was when he came for sex. She quickly learned, through Phillip’s advice, that resistance was futile and that it would only make things worse.“He forces my legs open and inserts the hard thing between his legs in me. It feels like I am being stretched apart. I am so small and he is so big. Why is he doing this? Is this normal?”For a few months, Jaycee would cry herself to sleep. Phillip became everything she had, for she depended on him for food, water, and human company. But she always dreaded the nights where Phillip came home drunk and wanting sex.Over the years, a lot happened. Jaycee was impregnated twice by Phillip, once at 13 and once at 16, and she gave birth to two healthy baby girls. Both of them would grow up barely knowing or having a conception of a world beyond the tents and rooms in the Garridos’ backyard.The complex where Jaycee and her children were held for eighteen yearsAs Phillip’s psychological influence on Jaycee took its toll. she became very submissive, reliant, and even sympathetic towards her captor. When he told his sad stories about how he had a “problem” he couldn’t control and that he needed her to help with it, she felt bad for him and maybe even a feeling that she had to remain there to protect others from Phillip’s “bad side.”Phillip opened a printing business that was moderately successful, and Jaycee was made the graphic designer of the business. She often had access to a computer, emailing, and a business phone to communicate with clients. Many customers recall talking to her over the years, but as further proof of the effectiveness of Phillip’s indoctrination, she never once mentioned or even hinted at her true identity or her kidnapping.As Jaycee grew up and became an adult woman, she no longer served to satisfy Phillip’s pedophilic lust. For once, showing that he was not entirely inhuman, he never once touched or violated his and Jaycee’s children. But he still, with Nancy’s help, frequented the playgrounds and elementary schools from which he could observe the children playing. He often asked Nancy to get the girls to lift their skirts or spread their legs and then took pictures from his car.During her 18 years of captivity, police had multiple opportunities to uncover the kidnapping or link Phillip to the disappearance. Most notably, the kidnapping had happened near South Lake Tahoe, just a few miles from where Garrido had kidnapped his first victim in 1976. Several leads were also discovered early in the search, but none led to any results.Examination of the Garridos’ backyard after the discovery revealed that all that was hiding the tent maze and Jaycee from the world was an 8-foot fence. Not once did the parole officers discover anything suspicious about the Garrido property, even as Phillip was brought up on several minor drug charges.Nothing, of course, besides the brilliant psychological manipulation of Phillip Garrido.In 2009, Phillip’s tendencies toward the supernatural finally got the best of him. He was always into ideas of the occult and alternative science, but he seems to have gone off the rails with this last plan. He brought Jaycee and their children to a police department at UC Berkeley to discuss his “God’s Desire” program. The officers there naturally found the pale and submissive girls suspicious and ran a background check, quickly discovering that Phillip was a registered sex offender on parole for kidnapping charges.The police detained Jaycee and the children, separating them from Phillip. Jaycee, even when questioned, still protected the truth about her identity and Phillip’s crimes. She made up a whole alibi and maintained her story right up until when Phillip cracked and admitted his kidnapping and rape of Jaycee. Even then, Jaycee, who had not so much as said her own name in over a decade, had to write out her name on a piece of paper.“I said I couldn’t say it. I wasn’t trying to be difficult. I told her I haven’t said it in eighteen years. I told her I would write it down. And that’s what I did. Writting shakily on that small paper, the letters of my name:”J A Y C E E L E E D U G A R DThe Garrido property was raided and endless evidence of the crimes was discovered. Nancy and Phillip were quickly arrested and Jaycee was brought back to the real world for the first time in eighteen years. She reunited with her family and continued to be a wonderful mother to her kids, who were already fast approaching high school age.In 2011, she published a memoir of her experiences in captivity and returning to normalcy, titledNancy Garrido was tried, found guilty, and sentenced to 36 years to life in prison, without the possibility of parole.Phillip Garrido was tried, found guilty, and sentenced to 431 years to life in prison, without the possibility of parole.Anyone who masturbates to elementary school children, kidnaps an eleven-year-old, and rapes/abuses her for eighteen years, is definitely the worst criminal in history to me.",4 followers,Eric Wang,3.1K,1.1K,22M,2019,https://www.quora.com/How-does-one-learn-about-the-best-upcoming-technology-books

But they would have an abundance of material on Earth, especially of carbon, which would likely be the building blocks of such an assemblers. If you were carrying a jar of them and tripped and they spilled out, and they had no limit, they would quickly devour the entire earth with no way of stopping them.But here is where things get interesting: These tiny robots would have the ability to construct molecules from atoms, giving them the ability to produce amazing materials like graphene, cubes of apple, and even brain material.With advanced nanotechnology in the form of self-replicators, the entire world would experience a revolution. Think for a second about what wouldn’t change in the face of machines that can produceProduction jobs would cease. The price of every item ever created would be lowered massively. Supercomputers and experiments regarding brain material would become almost commonplace. Terraforming other planets would take years if not months. And all of this is actuallyThere is a lot of power contained within those tiny machines.",5 followers,Jake Williams,4.7K,3.2K,76.6M,2017,https://www.quora.com/Which-is-best-upcoming-technology-in-2019

The difference is one wakes up in the year 2018 and the other wakes up in 1818.The latter wakes up chilly, to the sound of a rooster crowing, from a bed of straw he shares with lots of bedbugs. Neither his night shirt nor his bedding is terribly clean, and he splashes water on his face from a bowl to help wake up before looking outside to try to guess what the weather will be like today. He, like all of his family and most people he knows, is a farmer, so the weather matters a lot to him, and any other news will be a long time coming, including that his brother, who lives just a couple towns away, broke his leg a few days back and passed away from an infection. He works from sun up to sundown because he has little machinery and he would probably work longer if he had access to something better than candles to provide light.Our other man wakes up in 2018 to the sound of an alarm clock, he is not hot or cold because his home has central heating. His pajamas and bedding are quite clean because he has a washer and dryer. He is a bit groggy because he can light his home at the flick of a switch so often stays up later than he should. Fortunately he has hot coffee and a hot shower to help him wake up, and he checks his email while drinking that coffee and listening to the news and weather. He already knows his brother broke his leg a few days back, even though he lives a long distance away, and of course he does not die from an infection, he’s just at home bored and probably would welcome a phone call.These are two very different lives. They are separated by three centuries, a dozen generations, and a slew of inventions both major and minor. Those inventions, major and minor, have altered our civilization profoundly during that time. My answer however is not those inventions, but rather the ones emerging nowadays that will change our lives once more, many of which get little notice in the news.Even those emerging technologies that get reported with much pomp and hype often bypass a lot of the simple yet drastic changes they will bring to how we go about our normal day. A survey of technologies that don’t get talked about a lot, but will change the world we live in, requires introducing those technologies and explaining the potential of each. The trick is that technologies that don’t get a lot of fanfare don’t get it because their value and applications are not too obvious. Fundamentally, technology is about making our lives better, safer, and more convenient. To talk about the impact technology will have on our lives we need to go deeper than just what the technology does, like how a fusion reactor makes electricity cheaper and renewable, an obvious benefit, but also how it alters our day to day life. Cheaper electricity is awesome, an energy source that doesn’t run out or cause environmental problems is awesome, but it is easy to overlook all the other benefits that come along with them.We need to cover several such technologies. So to do this we will walk through a day in the life of two people, Sam, who lives nowadays in the year 2018, and Hannah, who lives just a few generations from now inOkay,What’s interesting about Sam and Hannah’s lives is that they both live in a pretty automated and high tech civilization.We spend a lot of time on this answer talking about futures in Hannah’s Era or even centuries further ahead, and we tend to focus on big things. New spaceships, new energy sources, giant constructs we could build around our own star or other stars and the ships that will get you there. Not today though, for today it does not matter that Ted was actually playing golf in a rotating habitat orbiting the Earth, complaining about how the spin throws off his normal swing. We care that his golf partner was actually lying down at home on his bed playing with him in virtual reality, and that he, Ted, and Hannah were thousands of kilometers apart, but all felt like they were in the same environment chatting, even though they were not in the same place and quite possibly all saw different environments. We don’t care that they have rocket ships with big fusion powered drives that can get to Mars in a week, we care about them having cars they can sleep in, fully relaxed in the knowledge that it could drive through a blizzard without a risk of accident and that if one did somehow happen, a dozen safety systems would pop on deploying airbags and restraints before the vehicle even hit the target, and that if somehow even that wasn’t enough, an automated ambulance would be on the scene in moments with robots controlled by experts hundreds of kilometers away piloting them, and already knowing from the vehicle monitors exactly what happened and where all the injuries were and how severe. We also don’t particularly care that Hannah’s son can do classes online, we already have ever-improving technology allowing that. We care about the automated interactive aspects of that, something called Affective Computing, or computers and systems that can recognize, interpret, process, or simulate human body language and affects. Fundamentally it is this sort of technology that holds the strongest potential to revolutionize our lives.Sure, a student can watch a recorded lecture and pick from several variations of it by other people covering that same topic, just as you can do now on YouTube for instance. But it is aThe Uncanny Valley, our tendency to respond more negatively to things which seem closer to human than further away, is a big hurdle to making such simulations, but if you can get past it, you open the door for books that don’t just get read aloud by some cold disjointed voice, but can be real-time performed like a TV show or interactive virtual environment without needing actors. It’s a lot easier to learn the history of the world when instead of a book or lecture or even historical TV drama, a person can land in that environment where the bits they find boring can be seamlessly detected and altered, so they remain focused on the important knowledge while enjoying themselves. It’s nice to have a test that doesn’t need to have questions checking your reading comprehension, because it already knows what that was from monitoring you while you read, and even nicer if most text can adapt as you’re reading it to rephrase the information or the question to better communicate to you as an individual. It’s like the automatic translator that doesn’t just hear what someone said in another language and translate it word for word, but instead can convert all the idioms and expressions into another language and its own idioms and expressions. It will be even cooler if one day we can just download knowledge and skills into your head, like in the film theWe didn’t focus on cool new power production methods like fusion today, we focused on ways to conveniently get power. Wireless energy transmission by magnetic induction or energy beaming, smaller and better batteries and solar panels, or harvesting energy right from the person. Leaching just a little energy away from every motion, maybe even putting devices in the body that could steal a bit of energy from your own food to transmit it to devices in or on you. IPredicting the future of technology is always a hit and miss game, often in hindsight the stuff is obvious, but can’t be predicted in advance. Some technology and its impact is easy enough to predict, but what makes them inaccurate in most cases is all those tiny secondary advantages and changes and those tend to focus on human desire and convenience. It’s not that hard to predict faster computers, the internet, satellites, or cell phones. What’s hard to predict is people using those to post a picture of what they ate for lunch. Once you do, you can imagine that a lot of restaurants will advertise online and show photos of the menu. It will seem obvious in hindsight that someone is going to make a piece of software that can look at that image and make some smart guesses about its nutritional value and calorie count. It will seem obvious in hindsight that as we get more Affective Computing able to monitor your reactions, your computer will get better at showing you bits of stuff on your social media newsfeed that you’ll enjoy, and that advertisers will be able to hit you with an ad showing a picture of pizza with the toppings you like when you are just getting a little hungry and haven’t had pizza recently, and tomorrow you’ll get shown sandwiches instead. It’s predictable that 3D printers, and fast, cheap, delivery might put a dent in classic retail shopping. It’s predictable that automated vehicles, not needing expensive drivers, will make it much cheaper to deliver things or take a taxi, so that fewer people might own individual vehicles.It’sHowever, it is very easy for us miss a lot of those secondary applications that can quietly sneak in there to revolutionize our lives just as much as landing on the Moon did, or going to Mars will.Have a great day (10 april 2018) !",8 followers,David Moore,1.2K,8.2K,75.6M,2016,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-most-dangerous-upcoming-technology-that-most-people-have-never-heard-about

This is how to achieve mass murder by video whilst smiling.He’s satirising ‘health authorities’ and telling people through sarcastic mockery that in truthHere’s what he’s referring to. Right here:ComorbiditiesTable 3 shows the types of health conditions and contributing causes mentioned in conjunction with deaths involving coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). For 6% of the deaths, COVID-19 was the only cause mentioned. For deaths with conditionsHere’s table 3.That’s all I can get as a screen clip but PLEASE go and scroll through the table. See how it starts with 357 deaths under age 24? That’s just the ones that have died - not the ones disabled by strokes, cardiomyopathy and fibrotic lung disease. In a way, those survivors are almost more tragic - having had their lives changed by people like this infecting them.But now to the real issue: what does the tableI’ve written a lot of death certificates. They’re important legal documents, obviously. However, they are matters of judgement. It is up to the doctor to decide to what degree some condition or other contributed to the death. For example, in a patient who had metastatic breast cancer but developed aspiration pneumonia and sepsis following a cerebral haemorrhage into tumour tissue what was the cause of death? Breast cancer? Some people would write just that. Others would list everything I just mentioned and possibly more. For example, sepsis often results in renal failure. In death, everything fails. Hence, it’s never technically wrong to list ‘‘myocardial infarction” when some elder passes away in their sleep, and many doctors do. Such presumptions (which are absolutely defensible in the absence of autopsy) contribute significantly to heart disease being the ‘‘number one killer’ in many societies.Hence, what the CDC data really shows is that there’s no reason at all to think there was anything else really wrong with more than 10 000 people who died. Anyone with ‘hypertension’ or ‘obesity’ were not included in that. 37,314 had hypertension as an antecedent listing. How’s your blood pressure?Hence, those 6% are simply those for whom doctors did not mention anything else on their death certificate. Possibly because they had no other medical history whatsoever. Remember, it’s ‘conditions OR causes’ - the conditions don’t need to be directly causative. Even I, as a 37-year-old doctor, don’t have a completely clean medical slate. I surf, I play basketball and touch football, and I chase a kindergartener with ease. If I were to die after contracting COVID-19 from the cases that will be created by local terrorists like the guy in the video then I would probably not be included in the 6% who ‘really’ died from the disease - sheerly by virtue of the fact that a colleague might list more than one item.PS pardon me if I get angry at COVID-deniers calling me a ‘smug little prick’ but when colleagues are grieving dead friends such stuff gets my ire up.

If you were carrying a jar of them and tripped and they spilled out, and they had no limit, they would quickly devour the entire earth with no way of stopping them.But here is where things get interesting: These tiny robots would have the ability to construct molecules from atoms, giving them the ability to produce amazing materials like graphene, cubes of apple, and even brain material.With advanced nanotechnology in the form of self-replicators, the entire world would experience a revolution. Think for a second about what wouldn’t change in the face of machines that can produceProduction jobs would cease. The price of every item ever created would be lowered massively. Supercomputers and experiments regarding brain material would become almost commonplace. Terraforming other planets would take years if not months. And all of this is actuallyThere is a lot of power contained within those tiny machines.","5,360 followers",Valerio Cietto,677,2.4K,9.1M,2017,https://www.quora.com/How-does-one-learn-about-the-best-upcoming-technology-books
