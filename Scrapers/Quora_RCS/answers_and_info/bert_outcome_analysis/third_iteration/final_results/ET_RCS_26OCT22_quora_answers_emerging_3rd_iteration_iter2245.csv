0,"From current rumours (unreferenced mind) and my predictions, this is how the iPhone 11 will shape up:Almost identical design to X and Xs, especially the front which I doubt will change at all.Face ID will still be the exclusive biometric security, but will be upgraded to gen. 2. Probably a minor speed upgrade (definitely not like the jump from Touch ID gen. 1 to 2 though) but mostly reliability and possibly range upgrades.Stronger glass, faster processor. Maybe a frosted glass back akin to the pixel 3.Reverse wireless charging.Retain lightning but include fast charger in the box.Triple cameraFrom current rumours (unreferenced mind) and my predictions, this is how the iPhone 11 will shape up:Almost identical design to X and Xs, especially the front which I doubt will change at all.Face ID will still be the exclusive biometric security, but will be upgraded to gen. 2.

Maybe a frosted glass back akin to the pixel 3.Reverse wireless charging.Retain lightning but include fast charger in the box.Triple camera on at least one of the two highest end models, hopefully on both but possibly just max. What the 3rd lense is though remains hazy. All cameras will be improved.Speaker and mic improvements (Apple seems to always consider these every single year while many other manufacturers just recycle last years because “it was good enough”)Internal layout change moving motherboard to the top of the device and horizontal and with a slightly larger battery below. This may slightly improve density.3D Touch removed. Lots of rumours around this, I’m unconvinced but maybe just stubborn.Identical price and storage configurations to Xs and Xs max.","32,527 followers",Kartik Ayyar,2K,1.2K,8.6M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-new-features-will-the-iPhone-11-have

3,"Well the use of engine design is make an engine which is suitable for the vehicle. Some factors on which it depends is on the weight of the vehicle, application, space, etc.For example if you put that small 1liter engine from your beater car in a race car then you will probably end up loosing the race. And likewise if you put a race engine in a family car the customer is not going to be all that happy( except people like me) because he would recieve worst fuel economy, reliability issues, worst city drivability. For a race car you need a engine which is upto race specs( doesn't matter even ifWell the use of engine design is make an engine which is suitable for the vehicle.

For a race car you need a engine which is upto race specs( doesn't matter even if it is also a 1 liter). A race engine should produce high horsepower at high rpms, should be light enough, should be strong to withstand the stress, etc and for a family car should have a reliable engine, efficient, good amount of low end torque, etc.There are two types of piston engine designs. They are:-Inline engines are generally used in daily driving cars. It is also used in racing. Inline engines have all the pistons in a straight line and hence its name.Since all the cylinders are arranged in a straight line it requires only one cylinder head, one set of cams to operate. So it is cheap to make and service. This is why it is used genderaly in normal cars. I have seen Inline design for upto 6 cylinders ( ya even a few 8 cylinders).On the other hand we have the V engine which is less common in street cars and more common in high performance cars. The cylinders and pistons which are aligned in two separate planes or 'banks', so that they appear to be in aThe V design is commonly used in engines with more than 4 cylinders. V engines take up same linear space as a Inline engine but are more wider than a inline engine. It is used because you can have more cylinders without increasing the hood length of the vehicle i.e it is compact by design. V design also allows you have a higher displacement engine without any worries of space. But , V engines are more expensive to build and maintain than a inline engine because you have another cylinder head to worry about. They are also more complicated than a inline engine.","20,169 followers",Sriraman Madhavan,4.1K,186,7.9M,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-latest-engine-technologies
