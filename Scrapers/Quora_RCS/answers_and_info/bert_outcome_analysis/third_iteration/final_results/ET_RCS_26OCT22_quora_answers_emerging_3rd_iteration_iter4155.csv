Revolutions that occured at different times, in different centuries have changed the face of the world and the way we are living today. These are some of the top picks that I would like to share with the readers:Top 10 Inventions that Changed the WorldA history of ingenuityCredit: igor.stevanovic /Humans are an ingenious species. Though we've been on the planet for a relatively short amount of time (Earth is 4.5 billion years old), modern Homo sapiens have dreamed up and created some amazing, sometimes far-out, things. From the moment someone bashed a rock on the ground to make the first sharp-edged tool, to the debut of the wheel to the development of Mars rovers and the Internet, several key advancements stand out as particularly revolutionary. Here are our top picks for the most importantLive Science's Jeanna Bryner contributed to this countdown, which was originally published on March 6, 2012.The wheelWheels were invented circa 3,500 B.C., and rapidly spread across the Eastern Hemisphere.Before the invention of the wheel in 3500 B.C., humans were severely limited in how much stuff we could transport over land, and how far. Apparently the wheel itself wasn't the most difficult part of ""inventing the wheel."" When it came time to connect a non-moving platform to that rolling cylinder, things got tricky, according to David Anthony, a professor of anthropology at Hartwick College.""The stroke of brilliance was the wheel-and-axle concept,""The hard work paid off, big time. Wheeled carts facilitated agriculture and commerce by enabling the transportation of goods to and from markets, as well as easing the burdens of people traveling great distances. Now, wheels are vital to our way of life, found in everything from clocks to vehicles to turbines. [Next: The nailThe nailWithout nails, civilization would surely crumble. This key invention dates back more than 2,000 years to the Ancient Roman period, and became possible only after humans developed the ability to cast and shape metal. Previously, wood structures had to be built by interlocking adjacent boards geometrically a much more arduous construction process.Until the 1790s and early 1800s, hand-wrought nails were the norm, with a blacksmith heating a square iron rod and then hammering it on four sides to create a point,Meanwhile, the screw a stronger but harder-to-insert fastener is thought to have been invented by the Greek scholar Archimedes in the third century B.C.Next: The compassThe compassModel of a Han Dynasty (206 B.C.Ancient mariners navigated by the stars, but that method didn't work during the day or on cloudy nights, and so it was unsafe to voyage far from land.The Chinese invented the first compass sometime between the 9th and 11th century; it was made of lodestone, a naturally-magnetized iron ore, the attractive properties of which they had been studying for centuries. (Pictured is a model of an ancient Chinese compass from the Han Dynasty; it is a south-indicating ladle, or sinan, made of polished lodestone.) Soon after, the technology passed to Europeans and Arabs through nautical contact. The compass enabled mariners to navigate safely far from land, increasing sea trade and contributing to the Age of Discovery.Next: Printing PressThe printing pressA printing press from 1811, now in the Deutsches Museum in Munich, Germany. Two printers worked at each press; one moved pages on and off while the other inked the text blocks. Together they could print 3,600 pages per day.Credit: MatthiasKabelThe German Johannes Gutenberg invented the printing press around 1440. Key to its development was the hand mold, a new molding technique that enabled the rapid creation of large quantities of metal movable type. Though others before him ‚Äî including inventors in China and Korea ‚Äî had developed movable type made from metal, Gutenberg was the first to create a mechanized process that transferred the ink (which he made from linseed oil and soot) from the movable type to paper.With this movable type process, printing presses exponentially increased the speed with which book copies could be made, and thus they led to the rapid and widespread dissemination of knowledge for the first time in history. Twenty million volumes had been printed in Western Europe by 1500.Among other things, the printing press permitted wider access to the Bible, which in turn led to alternative interpretations, including that of Martin Luther, whose ""95 Theses"" a document printed by the hundred-thousand sparked the Protestant Reformation. [Next: The internal combustion engineThe internal combustion engineA four-stroke internal combustion engine. 1) Intake stroke - air and vaporised fuel are drawn in. 2) Compression stroke - fuel vapor and air are compressed and ignited. 3) Power stroke - fuel combusts and piston is pushed downwards. 4) Exhaust stroke - exhaust is driven out.Credit: ZephyrisIn these engines, the combustion of a fuel releases a high-temperature gas, which, as it expands, applies a force to a piston, moving it. Thus, combustion engines convert chemical energy into mechanical work. Decades of engineering by many scientists went in to designing the internal combustion engine, which took its (essentially) modern form in the latter half of the 19th century. The engine ushered in the Industrial Age, as well as enabling the invention of a huge variety of machines, including modern cars and aircraft.Pictured are the operating steps of a four-stroke internal combustion engine. The strokes are as follows: 1) Intake stroke - air and vaporised fuel are drawn in. 2) Compression stroke - fuel vapor and air are compressed and ignited. 3) Power stroke - fuel combusts and piston is pushed downwards, powering the machine. 4) Exhaust stroke - exhaust is driven out.Next: The telephoneThe telephoneAlexander Graham Bell's Telephone patent drawing, from 1876.

Light bulbs changed the world by allowing us to be active at night. According to historians, two dozen people were instrumental in inventing incandescent lamps throughout the 1800s; Thomas Edison is credited as the primary inventor because he created a completely functional lighting system, including a generator and wiring as well as a carbon-filament bulb like the one above, in 1879.As well as initiating the introduction of electricity in homes throughout the Western world, this invention also had a rather unexpected consequence ofNext: PenicillinPenicillinFirst discovered in the lab in 1928, penicillin was being mass produced and advertised by 1944. This poster attached to a curbside mailbox offered advice to World War II servicemen: Penicillin cures gonorrhea in 4 hours.Credit: National Institutes of HealthIt's one of the most famous discovery stories in history. In 1928, the Scottish scientist Alexander Fleming noticed a bacteria-filled Petri dish in his laboratory with its lid accidentally ajar. The sample had become contaminated with a mold, and everywhere the mold was, the bacteria was dead. That antibiotic mold turned out to be the fungus Penicillium, and over the next two decades, chemists purified it and developed the drug Penicillin, which fights a huge number of bacterial infections in humans without harming the humans themselves.Penicillin was being mass produced and advertised by 1944. This poster attached to a curbside mailbox advised World War II servicemen to take the drug to rid themselves of venereal disease.About 1 in 10 people haveNext: ContraceptivesContraceptivesOrtho Tri-Cyclen oral contraceptives.Credit: Public domainNot only have birth control pills, condoms and other forms of contraception sparked a sexual revolution in the developed world by allowing men and women to have sex for leisure rather than procreation, they have also drastically reduced the average number of offspring per woman in countries where they are used. With fewer mouths to feed, modern families have achieved higher standards of living and can provide better for each child. Meanwhile, on the global scale, contraceptives are helping the human population gradually level off; our number will probably stabilize by the end of the century. Certain contraceptives, such as condoms, also curb the spread of sexually transmitted diseases.Natural and herbal contraception has been used for millennia. Condoms came into use in the 18th century, while the earliest oral contraceptive ""the pill"" was invented in the late 1930s by a chemist named Russell Marker.Scientists are continuing to make advancements in birth control, with some labs even pursuingNext: The InternetThe InternetPartial map of the Internet based on the January 15, 2005 data found onCredit: Creative CommonsIt really needs no introduction: The global system of interconnected computer networks known as the Internet is used by billions of people worldwide. Countless people helped develop it, but the person most often credited with its invention is the computer scientist Lawrence Roberts. In the 1960s, a team of computer scientists working for the U.S. Defense Department's ARPA (Advanced Research Projects Agency) built a communications network to connect the computers in the agency, called ARPANET. It used a method of data transmission called ""packet switching"" which Roberts, a member of the team, developed based on prior work of other computer scientists. ARPANET was the predecessor of the Internet.Source:","1,065 followers",Siri S R,20.2K,174,1.9M,2017,https://www.quora.com/I-have-a-revolutionary-technology-idea-but-I-have-no-money-or-expertise-to-realize-it-What-can-I-do

Such a device could prepare light soils for planting, but were virtually helpless on hard soil or marshy/grassy soils.In the 18th century, moldboards were added, which not only could dig a trench, but could also turn the soil so that a lower level of nutrient rich soil could be moved to the surface while old growth and/or last seasons crop could be pushed down a bit to mulch for future crops. But, this soil turning process required a lot more power. No longer could one person operate such a plow and it frequently required more than one farm pulling animal.Adding blades to the plow increased the drag though the ground requiring even more farm animals, such as four horses attached to one plow. The requirement for additional animals could literally eat one‚Äôs profits. But even worse, digging through certain soils such as those those containing clay orThus, the large plow needed two new elements.Power was provided by tractor inventors/manufactures. First the ungainly steam tractors followed shortly by reciprocal engine tractors (both gasoline and diesel). Such tractors, when properly geared, could provide immense puling power.John Deere is credited with inventing the non-stick, stainless steel plough that would mostly operate without clogging. Stubborn soils and heavy root growth would slide off of the blades. Blades had the additional benefit of remaining sharp for prolonged ploughing operations.Deere was not only a discoverer and inventor, he was also an astute business man and soon began an operation of plough-mass production which allowed customers to see the product they might want to purchase and immediately take delivery and begin use immediately rather than wait for a shop to custom build the product.Thus, the large plow concept had to wait primarily for adequate pulling power (the modern tractor) and stainless steel non-stick blades (along with other self cleaning features) and to less extent, for someone to begin mass production which lowered the price so that farmers could actually afford the equipment.That is my two cents worth.

20,"Many thousands of years ago, a bearded man came rushing into a narrow cave.He shook the snow off of the animal skins that covered him.Outside, the wind howled, pressing burningly cold air past the cave in a steady blast, snow moving horizontally in the wind.He crawled inwards, an armful of sticks and shrub at his side.Huddled into a corner, his family clung to each other, all of them shivering, hard, their bodies were near the physical limit of cold tolerance, severe hypothermia was only minutes away for his youngest child.Scrambling, he pressed the shrub down into a pile.He placed a chosen stMany thousands of years ago, a bearded man came rushing into a narrow cave.He shook the snow off of the animal skins that covered him.Outside, the wind howled, pressing burningly cold air past the cave in a steady blast, snow moving horizontally in the wind.He crawled inwards, an armful of sticks and shrub at his side.Huddled into a corner, his family clung to each other, all of them shivering, hard, their bodies were near the physical limit of cold tolerance, severe hypothermia was only minutes away for his youngest child.Scrambling, he pressed the shrub down into a pile.He placed a chosen stick into another set of sticks positioned over each other, wedging it in, holding the sticks down, he inserted a thin cylindrical branch between them, placed his palms on each side, and began pressing them in opposite directions in quick bursts.He‚Äôd been able to achieve a fire once before, months ago. But it was the only time he‚Äôd achieved it intentionally.He began spinning.His family watched, desperately waiting for the heat.Slowly, slowly but surely, smoke started to emerge.A tiny red dot began to form.Seeing it, he spun the stick harder, his arms burning from the effort.The dot got brighter and brighter.And just as the tiny glowing dot is about to convert to a small flame, a gust of wind from the blizzard shifts the air in the cave, blowing it out.He glanced upwards, his youngest daughter‚Äôs eyes were closed, lips blue.He began working at it again.His arms burned, he spun as fast as he could.A red dot formed.His family watching, hoping.Brighter, brighter, brighter.And finallyA small fire is born.He slowly places small shrubs around it.He shields the fire with his body, keeping the pulses of air from touching it.Finally, when he gathers the family around the fire, they huddle closely, soaking in the life-saving heat, saved from death only because he‚Äôd succeeded in creating this fire.My answer is not that fire is the most underappreciated invention.My answer is that the tool of man, the fulcrum of our evolution, the reason you sit where you sit today......Is right there in your pocket: Lighters.","9,587 followers",Max Searle,2.1K,82,6.7M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-of-the-most-revolutionary-technology-in-the-decade-of-2010-2020-that-completely-change-the-whole-world

22,"Hand dryers. They‚Äôre a terrible solution to a problem that doesn‚Äôt exist.I‚Äôd bet that anyone who‚Äôs used a hand dryer (even the nicer ones) knows that they don‚Äôt work very well.

They‚Äôre a terrible solution to a problem that doesn‚Äôt exist.I‚Äôd bet that anyone who‚Äôs used a hand dryer (even the nicer ones) knows that they don‚Äôt work very well. Paper towels are faster to use and they do a better job drying your hands.But, did you know that hand dryers are less hygenic than paper towels?The real argument that dryer companies make, though, is that paper towel waste is bad for the environment. That's only a little true; lSome people worry about the trees we have to cut down, but paper towels are usually made from recycled wood pulp, and they don‚Äôt need the really nasty binders or bleaches. The related problem of paper waste can be solved if we just put a bit of effort in; paper towels are easily biodegradable and can be composted. By fitting paper towels into the middle of a recycling stream, we don't need to cut down any trees, and no trash has to go to a landfill.Long story short, paper towels are a clean, hygienic, and sustainable bathroom solution, and hand dryers are a completely unnecessary replacement that‚Äôs actively worse.I‚Äôm tired of having soggy hands for no good reason.2020 edit:","5,360 followers",Valerio Cietto,677,2.4K,9.1M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-of-the-most-revolutionary-technology-in-the-decade-of-2010-2020-that-completely-change-the-whole-world
