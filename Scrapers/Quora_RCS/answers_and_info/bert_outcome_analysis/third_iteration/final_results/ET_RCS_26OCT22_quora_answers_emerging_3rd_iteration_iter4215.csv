3,"Grinding mills. Many people have grinding wheels in their driveways as ornamentation and might know what they are but have never seen how one works. These heavy stones were precision instruments where the top piece had to roll over the bottom, stationary piece with a distance of less then 1/16 of an inch between them. They were powered by wind or water or horses. Having a grinding wheel was a bid deal and a miller was an important person - he fed everyone in town and if the wheel cracked or it needed to be dressed and he didn’t have a spare, the corn piled up, was eaten by rats or rotted away.Grinding mills.

Having a grinding wheel was a bid deal and a miller was an important person - he fed everyone in town and if the wheel cracked or it needed to be dressed and he didn’t have a spare, the corn piled up, was eaten by rats or rotted away. There are still a few operating grinding mills, such as the one at the grist mill in Sudbury, restored by Henry Ford and one in Rhode Island. There is a massive grinding operation in San Antonio that was part of the Alamo mission complex that still works. And the story of Bob’s Red Mill is incredible: they still salvage and restore old mill wheels to grind their grains. Note that the grooves were specific to what you were grinding and had to be recarved from time to time. Stone grinding was an precision job by an expert. The first and best mill stones came from France. If the top stone touches the bottom stone even for a short time, the stones are ruined and need to be redressed.Ropewalks. In the old days, ropewalks were critical for sailing ships and making rope. The buildings were up to a quarter mile in length and men would walk that quartermile pulling a rope-spinning machine that would twist fiber into rope. At the end was a pitch pit where the rope was put into boiling pitch. Ropewalks were built on the water because the pitch pits would overflow, catch fire and burn down the entire city. Only a few ropewalks remain. One is in Philadelphia; one is in Baltimore and there was a big one in Boston that was recently converted into condos. It has a museum at one end showing how rope was made.Shoeing boxes. This was a critical piece of equipment for a farrier. Note that it was a farrier who shoed horses - not Blacksmiths. Blacksmiths could shoe horses but it was a big step down for them. Farriers shoed the horse and horses are heavy. The farrier has to take the horse’s weight while shoeing them and if the horse decides to sit or press down, he can kill a farrier. The shoeing box holds the horse up while he does the work.Laundry beetles and mangles. This equipment has been around for 100s of years but most people would be hard pressed to know what it does from looking at it. Beetle look like cricket bats and were used for many laundering operations from stirring up the vats with laundry being cleaned to beating the laundry on a rock. Mangles were boxes filled with rocks used to press clothing.Ice Houses. Not just a place where ice was stored but all the technology for cutting blocks of ice, dragging it from the lake and moving it to the conveyors to position it, cover it with sawdust and prepare it for the summer.Handrills. These tools were in use in Roman times and were still being used up til the mid-20th century. They were used to drill holes in granite at quarries in preparation for splitting it into blocks. I grew up with hundreds of these lying around the house because my grandfather had been a stoneworker/mason but I never knew what they were for until I saw at demo at the old Granite Quarries in Quincy where a ranger drilled a hole in a piece of granite in five minutes with a hand drill and a sledgehammer. I was amazed. I wish now I hadn’t thrown them all out when my dad died.Shot towers. At one time you could find shot towers in any city. They were used to drop a spoonful of molten lead from a height into a bucket of water. On the way down, the molten lead would form a perfect sphere, making a musket ball. Balls can be made in hand molds but it’s a slow and arduous task. Using a shot tower was form of mass producing shot. There is a shot tower in Baltimore but I don’t know of any others in America. They were in use in England until the 1960s.Rag pounding mills - In the time when printing first became established, paper was made in small lots by a few craftspeople but as the demand for books grew, the need for paper grew as well. In various places around Europe, particularly in Holland and France, massive mills grew up to make paper. Paper requires all kinds of long fibers usually found in rope and and cloth. Men scoured the continent buying up old rope from shipyards and collecting rags. One of the highest paid jobs in Europe in the 18th Century was rag sorter, the kind of man who knew how to sort and mix fibers to create various kinds of paper, such as wrapping paper, stationery, wallpaper, and book stock paper. Paper mills were considered high tech. One of the oldest companies in the world is a French paper mill that uses a rag pounder from the 1600s. Rags and rope had to be pounded in an acid solution until they broke down.There is absolutely no end to this sort of thing. I could go on for hours.Flint Knapping Mills - in the time of flintlock firearms it was necessary to have flint to strike a spark against steel. Knapping of flint is a time-honored skill that is largely lost now but at one time most people could knap flint because without flint you couldn’t start a fire very easily. While knapping a few stones here and there is okay for common people it is not sufficient for the armies of the day. So everywhere there was flint or chert to be found there were knapping factories. The biggest were in England, the flint suppliers to the world. One factory in England was producing 400,000 flints a month for the British Army during the war with Napoleon. There was still a knapping factory in England until after WW2 but there are none left - it’s a dying art. Note in the photo the little stone in the jaw of the hammer - this is a flint. In the old days everyone would know exactly what was going on with flint knapping. There were even special hammers.I wonder if anyone can guess what this thing is? In the “old days” possibly even into the 1920s almost everyone would have known what this was for if they didn’t live in a city.This is a basketmaker’s riving brace. They were very, very common. In the old days, there were no paper grocery bags. Those were invented outside Boston by a woman named Margaret Knight in the mid-1800s. Instead, everyone - and I mean everyone - used baskets for everything. And anyone outside an urban environment had basket-making tools such as this. Baskets can only be made from white or black ash because that would “rive”, that is it splits easily along the growth rings in long lengths. A basket maker would sit in front of this device and pass the strip of ash through a hole on the left (you can’t see in this photo) and up through the compressed point. The knees squeeze the boards together and then the ash is split lengthwise into strips by peeling it, a particular property of ash. Once it’s made into long strips it can be trimmed to width and woven into baskets. We use the term “basket making” as an insult for something easy but actually making baskets was a complex and tedious task that required enormous physical and mental labor. Baskets were absolutely everywhere from the beginning of civilization to the 1900s and were critical to supporting life. There is an entire pantheon of tools required to make the components for basket weaving and weaving the basket is only the final step. And yet everyone would know exactly what this tool was for just by looking at it.Here is another very common technology that would have been well known to almost everyone, particularly people who lived near the ocean or near large bodies of water:This is one of a series of “flax combs” used in the making of linen from flax. Linen was made through a labor-intensive, time consuming product and was critical to life particularly on the water because the sails of ships were made primarily from linen made from flax. In the old days, people could always tell a ship going out to sea and coming back. When a ship was going out to sea, the new sails were brown from the color of fresh linen sails and when they came back the sails were white because the linen was bleached by the sun. Linen was the best material for sails because it is extraordinarily strong, stronger than cotton, though cotton and even wool was sometimes used (by the Vikings) for making sails.Flax is a fast-growing weed that grows near the water. It’s plucked by hand - never with a sickle and bundled and the bundles are thrown into water a process called “rhetting” where it sits for awhile til it softens. Then it is allowed to drive and beaten with a “flax break” and scutching knife to break the fibers up.Everyone would have known what this tool was for. It hasn’t changed in 5000 years.Once the flax is broken up, it is pulled through the comb in the first picture - and there were a series of combs of different sizes. The first had the teeth in a pattern that allowed the user to capture the seeds which would then be broadcast back into the field to grow another batch of linen. After passing through five sizes of combs, the flax looks a lot like hair. It is then spun on a wheel into thread and then into cloth. The skill is in the spinner’s hand. They could make the finest or coarsest thread which would then be used to make fine clothing or strong sails. The weaver’s skill was in selecting the various hues of linen and he could make an attractive herringbone pattern or any design his mind could conceive. Linen was an excellent choice for a winter suit or coat because flax is very warm. But everyone would have known what these tools are for and if you go into ANY antique house or museum you will ALWAYS find at least one linen comb such as the one in the first photo. They were ubiquitous for making clothing - and also for making hemp rope. They were also used for breaking down the fibers of hemp into rope and while a homeowner COULD make his own hemp rope in small lots, one of the biggest industrial processes of the 1700s was rope making and all cities had 10 - 12 rope walks, were long lengths of rope were made. Rope walks were always located outside the city or on water because they frequently burned down.","5,154 followers",Barrie Levine,769,1.2K,12M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-historically-revolutionary-technologies-which-took-less-than-a-lifetime-to-appear-which-elderly-people-of-that-time-would-find-amazing-but-the-young-people-would-take-for-granted
