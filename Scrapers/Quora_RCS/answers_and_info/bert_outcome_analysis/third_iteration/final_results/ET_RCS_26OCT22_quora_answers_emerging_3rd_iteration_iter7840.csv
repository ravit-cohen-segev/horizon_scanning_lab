And obviously it is feasible, since the sun does it without any engineering at all!""Well no. First of all, the sun has half a million km thick insulation keeping the inside hot and half a million km thick deadweight pushing down from all directions keeping it compressed.Those 2 things are impossible to duplicate on Earth. Not just ""hard""; impossible.And even if they could be duplicated, then the rate of fusion inside the sun is so incredibly slow, taking around 10 billion years before a typical H fuses, that it would be utterly useless.Lots of people, even congressmen, know light-H fusion (the sun & stars) is vastly too hard and D-T fusion is much easier. So given that wide knowledge, a slightly trickier lie was needed.Sadly D and especially T are not so easily acquired as ordinary hydrogen. Indeed T (tritium) does not even exist on Earth (except perhaps for ultra microscopic quantities produced occasionally by cosmic rays or something). So then, according to a myth widely circulated to suckers by fusion-propagandists and con-men, we can solve humanity's energy problems easy-peasy by extracting deuterium (D) and lithium from SEAWATER (practically infinite supply!), convert lithium to tritium (T), then do D+T fusion; only waste products are harmless (and actually useful) helium, so just be incredibly happy and fund fusion research with $100 billions please forever!But that all is a lie that never will work, and anybody competent should know it never will work. Let me explain.First of all, even with D and T, the easiest fusion reaction, if you simply accelerate D in a cyclotron and fire it at a T target (or vice versa) then you will NOT get enough fusion energy produced to pay for the cost of acceleration. This experiment has been tried at every conceivable speed. None work, not even with a hypothetical 100% efficient cyclotron, at any setting whatever. So the only possible way to make D+T fusion work is to keep your D&T hot (costing zero energy once you have it hot, if your insulation is 100% effective) allowing multiple collision attempts not just one. That'd work fine except that no insulation yet devised has been anywhere near good enough, and the hot D+T want to explode out of there, not stay where you want it to stay. The best anybody has come up with to overcome that is to keep making your fusion reactors bigger & thicker, so it takes longer for D+T to leave and so you effectively get more insulation keeping the heat in there longer. The sizes then become enormous making it ultra expensive.Now let's look at the nuclear reactions we need. (Notation: D = deuterium = H-2, T = tritium = H-3.) The fusion reaction isD + T --> He-4 + n + 17.59 MeV (1)by far the easiest fusion reaction -- which means it is so vastly difficult that nobody has ever come close to achieving ""break even"" (despite several widely circulated published lies, told to the US government and general public about this, saying break-even already happened, it in fact never did, nor even came close, not even with various lying fake-redefinitions of the term “breakeven”).The ingredients needed are D which is naturally present in the oceans -- about 1 atom D per 6420 light-hydrogen atoms. And T: that unfortunately is very dangerous stuff, since radioactive with halflife 12.32 years.I used to live near the Princeton tokomak, and they told many lies to the public. (For example the lie that they had achieved “breakeven.”) One of their utterly irresponsible stunts was to run with D+T causing their entire incredibly huge and expensive reactor to become radioactive and hence no longer safely usable, which was a total waste of a vast amount of money to accomplish nothing since they could have just run with pure D; no safety risk that way, and results easily extrapolated to D+T so same science benefits, and in fact way more science benefits since reactor would keep being usable.But no, they had to go for the publicity stunt rather than acting responsibly -- which they did to try to con people into giving them funding.They told everybody the planned run was no risk and they were totally safe and there was no chance any T would leak. Bingo: First thing they then did was leak 100% of their enormous tritium supply (over a hundred pounds) irreversibly into the Princeton-Plainsboro environment, which was a vast amount of radiation, enough to kill every human on earth many times over (if that tritium were oxidized to water & fed to all humans in equal portions, they’d all die within a week).They then told everybody not to worry about it. Their story was it all went into the upper atmosphere far away. Unless it did not, since it burned, or was catalyzed, to form water -- a possibility they never ever mentioned to the media, not even for one word. Did they then go around putting up radiation detectors all over the Princeton-Plainsboro area to monitor to make sure their story was actually valid? No, of course not. That might risk revealing that something other than their story might be true, and that in turn might endanger their funding. Instead they tried to keep it all pretty quiet. My guess is about 75% of the people who lived in that area did not even know the leak happened.The tritium is produced fromn + Li-6 --> He-4 + T (2)That neutron (n) comes from a fission reactor. The fusion propagandists often lie and say fusion produces no radioactive waste (lie) and no proliferation risks since no fission reactors anymore so no longer will plutonium be widely available. That is also a lie since as we see you NEED a fission reactor to do reaction (2) at all. But then there is a propaganda claim those n's can come from the fusion reaction (1). That also is a lie. First of all, that only would work if 100% of the neutrons from (1) got used for (2), which is never ever going to come anywhere close to being true. The vast majority of the n's will fly away and never go where you want, they'll instead go where they want, destroying your ultra-expensive superconductors, ultra-expensive huge containment vessel, etc etc that make today's fusion reactors cost vastly vastly more than any fission reactor ever (despite never having achieved breakeven).I.e. the inefficiency in terms of neutron percent used versus wasted, will be huge. That will force the use of fission to generate the vast majority of the T. This means D+T fusion cannot, not even in principle, outlast fission as a sustainable energy source. Ever.The planned ITER fusion reactor, which hopes to produce about a piddly 500 MW of energy in the form of heat (which then will NOT be converted to electricity and NOT used to power any, e.g, homes -- it will simply be 100% wasted -- and it will only be able to run for a time scale of minutes before it must be shut down) from allegedly 50 MW of input power -- and thus allegedly exceed breakeven for the first time -- allegedly is going to cost about $85 billion, more expensive than any power plant ever constructed before, including ones that produce far more power and which actually work. It will rapidly self-destruct due to the fast neutrons, far faster self-destruction rate than any power plant ever before (at least intentionally) had -- thus destroying that huge investment. (Also, the 50 MW input power is a total lie, and in reality will vastly exceed that. One of the standard lie-techniques they always use is to divide the input into many different parts, then dismiss all but one of those parts. Scientists in other areas would never do that and regard it as massively unethical, but in fusion it happens pretty much every time I ever see any public statement they ever make.)And note that in net D+T fusion with T from lithium would involve two n's per 17.59 MeV output, even with the fantasy of 100% neutron efficiency.That is as compared to fission, which produces about 200 MeV per two neutrons. The fast neutrons from fusion (unfortunately vastly more energetic than neutrons from fission) destroy ANYTHING they hit, converting it into radioactive waste, and actually, as we now see, vastly MORE radioactive waste is produced per joule from fusion than from fission -- at least if ""neutron count"" is regarded as our proxy for ""amount of waste"" -- exactly contrary to their lies.That also tells us that — remembering that fission is needed to get the T to even allow D-T fusion to happen — that concomitant fission will be producting about 10 times the power produced by the fusion. So given that you need to build 10 GW of fission plant for every 1 GW fusion plant even in a fantasy world where fusion really were super easy and wonderful, why the hell even build those fusion plants at all??But ok, let's just focus on that Li-6. Natural lithium is 7.5% (atom fraction) lithium-6, with the rest being Li-7. (Lithium-6 has an atomic mass of 6.015 amu; lithium-7 has an atomic mass of 7.016 amu. The atomic mass of natural lithium is 6.941 amu.) T is made from Li-6.Seawater contains 0.18 milligrams of lithium per liter. Let us assume that separating that lithium from that liter of water, AND from everything else (i.e. all the other salts) in that water, AND purifying it, AND removing whatever the Li is chemically bonded to (e.g. chloride), AND isotopically separating into Li-6 versus Li-7... all together costs energy at least equivalent to the cost of EVAPORATING that 1 kg of water, i.e. 2.4 megajoules. I suspect that estimate is conservative, but admit I have not carefully considered the numerous unknown cleverest-possible separation schemas, partly since nobody can, since they are unknown.For anybody who insists on trying, I point out that at present, salt is commercially produced from seawater (vastly most commonly) by evaporation -- i.e. despite 2000 years of doing this commercially and research on same, no lower-cost method has come along that has taken over the sea-salt industry. And salt is way easier to get out of seawater than lithium: no need to purify, no need to isotopically enrich, don't need chemical reactions, thousands of times greater concentration. (Albeit most salt is NOT produced from seawater; instead it is mined, since producing from seawater is uneconomical by comparison. Total world salt production each year greatly exceeds total world lithium reserves for all time.)The 17.59 MeV output by reaction (1) per atom of T, or equivalently per atom of Li-6, is equivalent to 2.8*10^14 joules per kg of Li-6, i.e. equivalent to 1.8*10^13 joules per kg of natural lithium, i.e. 3.3 megajoules per liter of seawater.Now, assume your fusion reactor is at best 50% efficient. This is a very very very conservative estimate since the best fossil-fuel power plants ever made feature about 50% efficiency, and fusion is way harder, so far fusion has never achieved any positive efficiency whatsoever, not even 0.000001%.WE ARE DONE: the energy cost of obtaining the Li-6 from 1 liter of seawater, is lower bounded by 2.4 MJ. But the energy we get out of it is upper bounded by 1.6 MJ. Oops.IN OTHER WORDS: The ""we can get the Li from seawater"" claim is yet another widespread lie from fusion propagandists exposed by the pre-college-level calculation I just performed.CONCLUSION: you cannot do it by getting lithium from seawater.If we have to get it from lithium ore: the total known world reserves of lithium ore are small, about 2 million tonnes. That's considerably smaller than uranium reserves. In other words the whole lie that the ingredients needed for fusion energy are ""common"" and ""cheap"" and it is better than fission, and will keep us going longer, is all utter garbage.POSSIBLE ESCAPE ROUTE: Can you get the lithium not from seawater, nor ore, but instead from average rocks? The good news is Li abundance in earth crustal rocks is about 20 milligram per kg, i.e. about 100 times its abundance in seawater per kg. But unfortunately it is harder to extract Li from rocks than from seawater, since for one thing melting rock is a lot harder than boiling seawater. You could try to extract the Li by means of repeated cycles of remelting with fractional crystallization... I tend to doubt this will work too well... or: dissolving in acids, again with fractional crystallization could be tried (multiple cycles), then trying to recycle the waste products... I would guess that might work better... and then we need to isotopically separate...So it is highly unclear to me what the cost would be, since as far as I know nobody has ever seriously tried to extract lithium from either granite or seawater before, since both are incredibly stupid and uneconomical. That is because every mining operation that has ever been undertaken, after 1000s of years of trying, that is trying to extract something with parts-per-million concentration levels, has yielded a VERY EXPENSIVE product, and energy use is a big reason why it is so expensive. For example, gold ore in today's mines typically features concentration of 5 milligram gold per kg of ore. Know how much gold costs? Currently about $1971 per troy ounce, which is $63 per gram. Gold is quite easy to separate from ore, lithium from granite would be chemically much harder. So I might conjecture that lithium extracted from average rock, e.g. granite, would cost about $300 per gram in year-2020 dollars, which at the current price of electricity ($0.133 per kW-hr USA year-2020 average) is equivalent to 8 gigajoules of energy to perform that mining & extraction of 1 gram. I am guessing the isotopic separation will raise that $300/gram cost for rock-lithium up to about $400/gram. This is all a very rough and conjectural guess-calculation.But anyhow, a gram of lithium contains 0.075 grams of Li-6, which yields 140 gigajoules of fusion energy assuming 50% efficiency. So that (since 140>11) actually sounds promising.It would be a fairly difficult and large exercise to try to figure out the best possible cost to extract Li from ordinary rock and redo my rough calculation last paragraph justifiably correctly; and that is an effort which the fusion community simply has never lifted a finger to even start trying to do even after 70 years. That is because lying is easier and more profitable for them than actually doing research.You may be getting the impression I have an attitude of tremendous contempt for fusion research. That is correct. They are the worst. They have lied and lied for 70 years, including under oath, have a worse record of failure and lies than almost any (perhaps all) other fields of science, and they continue to lie still while still having accomplished absolutely nothing after 70 years despite more funding than almost anything. Throughout those 70 years their perpetual refrain has been in 10-20 years they'll supply us with limitless energy too cheap to meter. Then when it does not happen they say ""Oh, don't blame us, there were really really complicated unexpected problems nobody could have anticipated, but we understand all that now, so just fund us 10-20 more years to reach the land of milk and honey!"" Which was always a lie. In fact, those problems were very easy, not hard, to anticipate, BUT their livelihood depended on not anticipating them and pretending they would not exist, so they covered their eyes.And the truth, which they almost never say out loud, is that to have any hope of having any use, fusion would have to be based on a NEUTRONLESS reaction, such as B+H fusion. Only neutronless reactions can work without rapidly turning your ultra-expensive fusion plant into radioactive waste rendering it un-economical at a level beyond belief.So: not D+D, not T+D, not H+H+H+H, not almost any fusion reaction almost anybody ever hears about in fusioneering propaganda -- none are acceptable and everybody competent has always known that.But B+H is vastly vastly harder than D+T fusion (and boron is even rarer than lithium!), probably 10000 times as hard, hence vastly vastly further from ever happening, which is why they hardly ever talk about it.It would be bad for their funding if that truth were better known; and their primary desire is to lie and deceive to keep the funding train going. They do not give a crap about scientific ethics, the future of humanity and the ultimate usefulness of it all. All they care about is lying to the gullible to get more funding. I have read many government ""reports to president"", transcripts of scientist testimony to congress, public educational brochures put out by Princeton Plasma lab, etc where the lies above (& others! What I have mentioned is the tip of the iceberg) are baldly stated as ""facts.""I cannot tell whether they actually are so incompetent that they believe their own lies, or whether they lie fully intentionally. All I know is they lie, and those lies can be exposed by pre-college level calculations, and they keep on repeating those lies for 50 years, to people like presidents and congressmen whom they correctly figure will not do said calculations. I find it appalling.Many scientists know this reality, I presume -- but most are too wimpy to say it aloud and risk that an attempt will be made, backed up by enormous money and influence, to damage their careers. I however, am not one of those wimps. I've been saying this stuff my entire career, probably to its detriment, and with apparently no useful effect on the US government, which like an idiot turned off all funding for breeder fission research (an actually workable idea, but it will take many years of experimenting to make it get good -- crucial years our government has idiotically sacrificed) so that it instead could focus exclusively on fusion quackery.8 Aug 2021 News Flash:Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory’s (LLNL’s) National Ignition Facility (NIF) allegedly achieved ""ignition"" (of DT fusion fuel pellet using lasers) for the first time, producing a 1.3 MJ explosion. This allegedly exceeded the laser energy going into the pellet by a factor of 5 and broke the old energy record by a lot. Great accomplishment? No: As their scientist Omar A. Hurricane fully admitted:(A) That 1.3 MJ was only a tiny fraction of the electrical energy that powered NIF's lasers. It is sort of like a stone age man declaring to the media that he’s “invented fire” if the amount of energy he can get out of the fire is far tinier than the amount of energy he uses rubbing sticks together.(B) Zero of the ""produced"" 1.3 MJ energy was actually used to generate usable power. But even if 100% was somehow used, this would still be a total failure as a way to generate energy (see A).(C) Yes, 1.3 MJ allegedly exceeded the laser energy(D) And indeed (just in case you thought that was not “typical”) in 2013 NIF also had announced “ignition” and “breakeven” after producing a 14 kJ explosion of a pellet, powered by a 1.8 MJ laser flash as input. Note how the output was over 100X smaller than the input. Notice how now, in the 2021 Proclamation of First Ever Glorious Success they did not mention, at all, their 8 year earlier Proclamation of Glorious Success, which they now laugh at as a pathetic con job, except they do not, they just evidently now pretend it never happened.But still, (C) sounds like a notable milestone that might enable them to experimentally study ignition.More (independent of me) people who have similar opinions and/or similarly disturbing facts:Physicist Sabine Hossenfelder with a youtube video:The “New Energy Times” founded by journalist S.B.Krivit exposes many facts about fusion research and outrageous cons involved in it - in particular ITER:",826 followers,George Dowson,4K,527,3.7M,2021,https://www.quora.com/How-close-are-we-to-achieving-nuclear-fusion-At-what-point-will-it-become-a-possible-source-of-energy

It is remarkable that we (as a species) are even attempting it and more remarkable that we may well succeed.People seem to think that fusion is relatively easy, but it really isn’t. Even in the core of the sun, fusion generates only a small amount of net heat. A cubic metre of the sun’s fusing core only generates around 275 watts. That’s less energy output than we give off as body heat for an equivalent volume. The reason why the sun is so hot is because there are hundreds of thousands of miles of insulation (in the form of hot gas contained by gravity) around this heating centre.There’s a reason stars burn for billions of years, they really only burn slowly.Now consider the conditions at the core of the sun - 250 billion atmospheres, 15 million degrees (K or C doesn’t matter at this scale). And that is sufficient to make a piddly amount of heat per cubic metre. Scaled down to operations that would fit on Earth, that’s not going to cut it for power generation. You’d get more power out of a single large solar panel in good conditions. (That might seem odd but consider the sheer size of the sun, even “just” the core region).What’s more, we can’t achieve those sorts of pressures so we need much higher temperatures before we even start fusion; closer to 100 million degrees. We then need to surround this heating zone with the kind of insulation a few hundred thousand miles worth of mind-bogglingly dense gas and plasma provides (using superpowered magnets), and then we have to extract sensible energy without causing the whole reaction to stall and still end up with enough energy to outweigh the inevitable energy losses.I hope this gives you an idea of what an achievement creating a working fusion power plant will be.

The best estimate of the total power being radiated in light from the sun isHowever the star Sirius has about 50 times the Sun’s luminosity, and there are stars that emit 20–30 thousand times as much power, such very bright stars are, however, much shorter lived than is the Sun.There is a small additional radiant energy flux in neutrinos and there is some energy released from the Sun in the form of the solar wind as well. All of this energy originates from fusion, and the Sun has been fusing hydrogen to helium for perhaps 4.5 billion years. However the rate of fusion has not been constant over that whole time but instead is slowly growing as the Sun ages. So in this sense, your question, how much energy does fusion produce is not terribly well-defined. One could say that in all likelihood most of the radiant energy in the universe is right now being produced by fusion. There are other contributors too, massive black holes, gamma ray bursts, supernovae, neutron star mergers, black hole mergers and other such exotic and very distant phenomena, but they are not dominant.At the mean distance of the Earth from the Sun, the solar luminosity translates to a radiant power per unit area of 1.361 kW/m^2 at the top of Earth’s atmosphere at solar minimum, and 1.362 kW/m^2 at solar maximum, a number which is called the Solar irradiance. The Sun’s total luminosity varies with the 11 year sunspot cycle by a small amount. The Sun is a weakly variable star, and as I pointed out the total power it produces is increasing over geological timescales.That 1.362 kW/m^2 arriving at the top of the Earth’s atmosphere translates into aThe integrated value of that power incident at the surface is enormous - roughly 1 hours worth of the Sun’s total output, if and this is a very big if, it could be captured, stored, and used, would be about equal to the total annual energy consumption of all of humanity. Practically speaking, however, it is a massive engineering project to capture that much energy and use it. Storing energy in particular is an extremely costly proposition with current technologies.Now, as to artificially producing fusion, I am sorry to say this, but it is a very, very difficult problem. One can’t duplicate in a laboratory on Earth, the conditions that exist deep in the core of the Sun, where gravity confines hydrogen and helium ions at a density of about 150 times the density of water, and at a temperature of about 15,000,000 degrees Kelvin, so that the protons continually collide and re-collide with each other, very occasionally fusing in an extremely slow reaction in which deuterium is formed.What has to be done on Earth is to use other fuel than protons, and people are trying with deuterium and tritium, but the creation of such high densities as exist in the Sun at the needed temperature for a large amount of hydrogen fuel, and for a very long time, so as to produce fusion as the Sun does, is simply not an option on Earth. Most of the approaches to creating fusion power artificially work by producing very high temperatures instead, much higher than those existing in the core of the Sun. There are a number of approaches to doing it, none of which are at the present time practical.The one approach to producing fusion energy that really can be said to work right now is the mechanism employed in thermonuclear weapons, in which a small nuclear fission weapon is used to very efficiently compress, heat and ignite a secondary containing fusion fuel. But employing nuclear weapons as sources of energy is not likely to go over well with the public, given their general attitude towards nuclear power, and there are obvious practical problems and also serious dangers associated with such an approach.So now, and for the foreseeable future, I suspect that the closest we will get to practical fusion power is probably 93 million miles, which is about 1 AU, the mean distance from the Sun.I sincerely hope that I am very wrong, but I have been watching the discussions of fusion energy for almost forty years now, and the technical problems that are involved are simply very difficult problems which are arising from fundamental physics. It is best to concentrate on means of producing useful energy that are actually available right now, in order to be able to maintain civilization at a high rate of energy use until a transition to a far lower and constant rather than exponentially growing world population, and a lower overall demand for energy to do useful work, can be completed.That’s not to say don’t do any research into fusion, but it would be very irresponsible to claim that it will be solving the world’s energy problems any time soon.",826 followers,George Dowson,4K,527,3.7M,2019,https://www.quora.com/How-close-are-we-to-achieving-nuclear-fusion-At-what-point-will-it-become-a-possible-source-of-energy

The quantity of deuterium in the world’s oceans is estimated at 4.6 x 10^13 metric tons. Deuterium present in seawater will yield around 5 x 10^11 TW-years of energy. In the year 2017 the entire planet consumed around 17 TW-years of energy, which means that the energy content of the deuterium in seawater would be enough for 29.5 billion years of energy supply.To give all 10 billion people expected to live on the planet in 2050 the level of energy prosperity we in the developed world are used to, a continuous average use of power of 6 kilowatts per person as is typical in Europe, we would need to generate 60 terawatts as a planet—the equivalent of 900 million barrels of oil per day.The time since the earth first formed = 4.54 billion years.The time until the sun burns out = 5 billion years.The deuterium in the sea is capable of completely powering planet earth at a level of 60 Terawatts for 8.33 billion years(longer than the earth has existed or the sun will burn).------Large tokamak magnetic fusion designers often tend to discount the deuterium-deuterium (D-D) fusion reaction because it is not possible to achieve the necessary fusion reaction rates and break-even energy with D-D fusion using tokamaks and stellarator devices such as we currently are able build. The situation is different, however, with Inertial Confinement Fusion which typically employs a fusion plasma that are literally 10^11 times more dense than the typical ion plasma densities used in MCF tokamaks or stellarators.The power than can be drawn from a plasma at fusion conditions is proportional to the second power of the plasma ion density. Even small improvements in plasma ion density will result in significant improvements in the performance of a fusion experiment.There is an impressively large Range of plasma density in current and planned fusion experimentsThere is literally a factor of 10^10 to 10^11 difference in plasma ion density between MCF and ICF fusion experiments. This large difference has implications for commercial fusion technology as the denser the plasma, the more power that can be realized from a fusion burn and the smaller the physical fusion reactor can be while achieving fusion energy with energy gain.The D-D reaction takes place at higher temperatures than can typically be achieved in magnetic confinement tokamaks and typically has a lower fusion cross section leading to lower fusion reaction rates on earth relative to D-T fusion .D-D fusion is more complex and proceeds with multiple fusion side reactions, but when all of the side-chains run to completion, D-D fusion actually produces more energy than D-T fusion per starting mass of reactants. D-D fusion produces T and He3, which in a secondary reaction burn with D. This was practically demonstrated in early thermonuclear tests like the 10 Megaton Ivy Mike fission triggered deuterium experimental test in 1952.D-D fusion does normally produce TritiumD-D Fusion of Deuterium fuel produces energy through four reactions:D + D -> He-3 + n + 3.268 MeVD + D -> T + p + 4.03 MeV(side chains)D + T -> He-4 + n + 17.588 MeVHe-3 + D -> He-4 + p + 18.34 MeVThe net effect of these four fusion reactions taken together is:6 D -> 2 He-4 + 2p + 2n + 43.243 MeV-------Fusion and neutronsDT and DD fusion release large amounts of their fusion energy in the form of fast neutrons.The task of shielding fast neutrons requires• Fast Neutrons (E >1 MeV) must first be thermalized with highneutron scattering materials (typically materials that have a high percentage of light atoms like hydrogen)• These thermal neutrons can then be absorbed or shielded with material having high cross sections for neutron absorptionAbsorption of thermalized neutrons can be done by relatively light materials like polyethylene plastic unlike gamma radiation that require lots of high-z material (lead, concrete, water) to absorb the penetrating gamma.LLNL's Dr. Ralph Moir has pioneered several molten salt fusion reactor concepts (HyLife II and PACER Revisited). A thick liquid falling wall of molten salt loaded with a neutron absorber like 50 micron particles of Boron Carbide as a slurry can absorb damaging fast neutrons. Such a thick falling wall of molten salt can effectively protect fusion chamber structure and largely prevent neutron activation of fusion reactor materials. This permits molten salt ICF fusion reactors to have long 30+ year commercial lifetimes and to at reactor end of life produce little or no neutron activated waste.Slide comparing fission and various fusion reactions from Professor Gerald KulcinskiThere are actually rather good reasons to believe that when nuclear fusion is commercially introduced, it will in short order form the basis of very commercially competitive power plants that will deliver reliable, cheap energy to all in the world that need energy.Fusion’s near term commercial potential -Not all approaches to nuclear fusion will have identical commercial characteristics. Some approaches to nuclear fusion will not in the end be able to produce any actual energy beyond what is required to operate the fusion experiment and as a result will effectively become fusion research dead ends. Other fusion approaches including some that currently receive high levels of funding and international support may ultimately reach break-even energy, but these approaches to fusion may after scaling end up so extraordinarily complex and impractically huge in size may that they end up being commercially uncompetitive with fossil fuel and renewable energy power plants. Such a large experimental fusion physics demonstration may perhaps be built only a single time as a kind of technology proof of principle, but then go no further and never get built in any significant numbers by communities needing cost competitive electrical power.Plasma Density matters when competing to produce cheap energy -Approaches to fusion that routinely use very low density plasma, like tokamaks (ITER) and stellarators (W7-x) will have to be physically larger and contain a much greater volume of fusion plasma than fusion devices that routinely operate on denser plasma. There is literally a 10^11 difference in operating plasma density at fusion conditions between Magnetic Confinement Fusion (MCF) devices like tokamaks and stellarators and Inertial Confinement Fusion (ICF) Experiments like NIF. This is a huge natural competitive advantage to ICF fusion in terms of potential commercial competitiveness.Comparison between the fusion chamber volume of an Inertial Confinement Fusion experiment (NIF) versus a Magnetic Confinement Fusion experiment (ITER) -(notice man in lower right corner for scale)Those who advocate Magnetic Confinement fusion devices will be quick to point out however that ICF fusion currently requires a large stationary football field sized laser fusion driver to ignite the small high plasma density ICF fusion capsules. This is true, but the size and the cost of ICF laser fusion drivers is dropping very rapidly (and the cost of ICF laser fusion drivers are also dropping at a rapid rate) and the impact of the laser fusion driver is destined to be a shrinking contributor to ICF fusion power plant physical size and cost.The power that a pulse laser fusion driver can deliver has increased roughly by a factor of 1000 every decade for the last 40 years. This is in fact a stronger sustained technical advance than even Moore’s law (transistors on a CPU chip).Cost of fusion power generators that can operate using high density fusion plasma -As previously mentioned, the physically smallest and least costly commercial fusion power plants of the future will probably operate using the highest density fusion plasma. Approaches to fusion that cannot operate on a least medium density plasma (10^18 ions/cm^3) will probably not be able to compete, head to head, with fossil fuel or renewable energy power plants.LPP Fusion is currently a private sector small fusion leader in the quest for fusion and is expected to use medium density fusion plasma in their Dense Plasma Focus fusion device. LPP Fusion has produced the following slide as a cost goal for their small modular commercial fusion device.These is a respectably low and impressive cost estimate for small fusion.The Department of Energy EIA's findings suggest that natural gas–fired power plants are cheaper to build with overnight capital costs ranging fromLPP Fusion’s DPF device would be 10X or more cheaper to build and would produce 10X cheaper electricity than the cheapest current form of natural gas power plant.ICF fusion power plants that use the densest fusion plasma have the potential to be the most cost competitive of all small fusion approaches when the technology becomes commercially available.As fusion power plants advance to commercial reality over the next decade, they should improve in power density and decrease in cost.Small Fusion: step by step and one step at a time.Effort to bring fusion to commercial reality will be rewarded.The investment in fusion technology will be justified and the low cost power that fusion will generate will lift billions of people around the world currently without any access to electricity out of chronic grinding poverty and want.","3,658 followers",Brent Oster,3.6K,357,1.8M,2019,https://www.quora.com/How-close-are-we-to-achieving-nuclear-fusion-At-what-point-will-it-become-a-possible-source-of-energy

The water will be separated from oxygen and then blasted with neutron to make fuels like deuterium and tritium.While the fuel will be extremely efficient and cheap but the reactors may cost so much that they can not be built to provide the low carbon energy we need. It may be 2035 by the time a working, power production reactor could be produced.Also with these reactors, the neutron will damage the structure and components of the reactor. So expensive components may need to be replaced regularly.The plasma produced by the reactor will be more than twice as hot as the sun. So it can not be in contact with any part of the reactor. The plasma would melt any components.On the bright side a blanket of molten salt surrounding the reactor could collect the neutrons and heat energy without damaging the reactor. Also the molten salts could contain radioactive material bonded to the salt. The radioactive material, possibly nuclear waste could be broken down by the neutrons and burning them up to produce heat energy and more neutrons. So a fusion reactor could be used to destroy high-grade nuclear waste.Such a reactor with molten salt could produce both fusion and fission power. Without any risk of a meltdown. The supply of neutrons could be stopped immediately from the fusion reactor. Producing very cheap power, destroying waste and protecting the reactor from neutron damage. The molten salt could quickly be drained from the reactor to a low neutron cooling tank.But for the foreseeable future nuclear fusion reactors will be too expensive to build.For a more immediate supply of vital low carbon energy, we could produce MSR fission reactors instead. MSR reactors could be in production within 10 years. They can also be fueled by nuclear waste, mining waste and unused weapons material.MSR reactors use salt for cooling and to carry the nuclear fuel through the reactor core. Bonded to the salts. Unlike current, common PWR reactors MSRs do not need very high-pressure water, need inefficient fuel rods that could melt or expensive enriched Uranium as fuel. Molten salt reactors can work at much higher temperatures with no risk of exploding or meltdowns. If the temperature gets to hot the liquid salt and fuel is automatically drained into a low neutron cooling tank.MSR reactors could also run on Thorium as a fuel. Thorium is cheaper amd more common than Uranium. It does not need expensive and dirty enrichment producing tons of nuclear waste. The Thorium can be completely burnt up leaving much less waste. And the fissile products produced by the reactor can also be burnt up. Producing more energy. Some very useful products can be removed from the salt mix.

And that is sufficient to make a piddly amount of heat per cubic metre. Scaled down to operations that would fit on Earth, that’s not going to cut it for power generation.

For scale, there is a person standing on the extreme left of the image about halfway down (9 o’clock position). The pressure vessel (the first section of which is complete and slowly making its way into this pit) will contain more steel than the Eiffel tower. Once running, the core will be the hottest place in the solar system, in fact it’ll be hotter than anywhere within around 100 light years of Earth as only blue supergiant stars get this hot at their cores.And ITER is just the small scale prototype.

The high-level waste that usually gets media attention is in the form of solid fuel pellets inside zirconium rods, which after cooling for five years can be loaded into concrete and steel containers for transport or storage.If transported to any of the proposed storage or disposal sites in the arid southwest, there is essentially zero chance of it ever migrating into the environment. Compare that to the tons of toxic (and some radioactive) particulates and carbon dioxide that fossil plants discharge into our air, and it is clear nuclear fission is millions of times “greener” than fossil plants.The only real problem with high-level waste is the government's inability to meet its commitments for handling it. This flows from the widespread ignorance among the general public about radiation in general and the tendency of politicians to prey on that ignorance for short-term gain.Although fusion power plants would likely be cleaner than the old fission plants, we should not be reluctant to deploy what is already a million times better than what it would replace. Many of the new fission plant designs produce less (or no) high-level waste. Some are capable of burning the existing high-level waste for fuel. Many of the smaller new designs feature “inherent safety,” in that the meltdown scenario is not just unlikely, it is physically impossible.– Dwight B.Hi, Dwight, and thanks for sending in your note. Energy production is one of our favorite topics atAs a reminder for new readers, nuclearOf course, this has trade-offs. Fission creates nuclear waste that can poison our environment if it’s not properly stored. And many people associate this technology with high-profile nuclear meltdowns from fission reactors.In fact, I was living and working in Tokyo during the nuclear meltdowns in Fukushima back in 2011. I sent my family to the southern part of Japan to be safe while I guided my company through the crisis.I had radiation meters in my office so that my team could understand that they were safe, and the radiation hadn’t spread to Tokyo. There were, however, periods when there was the risk of radiation clouds depending on the weather and winds, and when that happened we needed to stay inside.This was an unbelievable experience to have gone through. It was one that I could have never imagined. And it was all avoidable.There were terrible management failures on the part of the power company in Japan. This resulted in the reactors not being safely shut down in advance. And there were faults in the plant design that also could have been addressed sooner to prevent the meltdowns.So some people might be surprised to hear that I am not at all against nuclear fission. I believe nuclear fission is one of the few technologies that could get the world off fossil fuels, reduce carbon emissions, and provide baseload power for our electrical grids 24/7.In fact, third-generationfission reactor technology has been around since the ’90s. These designs are far safer and even more efficient than the reactors the U.S. currently has online. Yet these third-generationreactors are mainly being built in India and China, not here in the U.S.And fourth-generation fission reactor designs are even more economical and safer than third-generationreactors. Technologies like sodium-cooled fast reactors (SFRs), gas-cooled fast reactors (GFRs), very-high-temperature reactors (VHTRs), pebble bed reactors, and molten salt reactors (MSRs) all show great promise.Nuclear fission technology is based on mature technology and releases no CO2 into the atmosphere. So why isn’t the entire Western world building third- and fourth-generation nuclear fission reactors?The answer is politics.Ignorance and negative emotions around nuclear fission technology are very real, even if these reactions aren’t based on logic. The media coverage and popular sentiment against fission technology tend to be visceral despite the technological advances.Yet those same people think that they are doing something good for the environment when they drive their electric vehicle that is fueled by electricity that comes from natural gas (carbon). It is completely absurd.Due to the “bad politics” of fission, I don’t believe that we will ever get the approvals to upgrade our infrastructure with modern, safe fission technology. This deeply saddens me because we have had a clean and carbon-free solution available for decades and we haven’t used it.We could have literally been at a stage of zero carbon emissions today had we simply adopted third-generationnuclear fission technology. And you are correct – there are safe ways to store the waste that is produced. There are even ways to use or recycle that waste in existing reactors.Fusion, on the other hand, is an easier sell to society. After all, it’s the power of the Sun. It is harder to argue against that. It’s the combination of two separate nuclei to form a new nucleus. In that process, huge amounts of energy are released. That’s why I’veMy favorite approach uses a proton-boron (pB-11) fuel. The advantage of using pB-11 is that the reaction produces no neutrons. The output is just three helium nuclei and a whole lot of clean energy. No radioactive waste at all.These advanced reactors are immensely complex. Yet with our advancements in materials science and artificial intelligence, we will be able to optimize the reaction for the best energy output.This will change the political debate entirely and put the world on a path to clean energy. And I can’t wait to see it happen. That’s why I’ll continue covering developments in this space as we head toward a world of completely clean energy - Jeff Brown.But he believes fission is doomed, anyway, asThe biggest nuclear fusion deal to date…Vancouver-based General Fusion just announced a major deal with the U.K.’s Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA). Per the partnership, General Fusion will build and operate a nuclear fusion reactor on the UKAEA’s Culham Campus.This is one of the most exciting developments in the industry to date. And General Fusion is one of the most promising companies in this space. I’ll explain why in a minute.But first, let’s bring newer readers up to speed on fusion technology.Nuclear fusion involves taking two separate nuclei and combining them to form a new nucleus. This produces an enormous amount of energy. And it is 100% clean. Unlike nuclearAnd there are different technological approaches to building nuclear fusion reactors. We don’t yet know if there will be one predominant way, but I’m excited that the industry is developing so many different approaches.General Fusion’s approach is called Magnetized Target Fusion. It entails generating a plasma reaction in a spherical reactor at extremely hot temperatures – temperatures that are hotter than the Sun.The reactors can be developed in a way so that they are compact. And they don’t take immense amounts of space and money to build. We can think of these compact reactors as being powerful enough to feed 100,000 homes.This would allow us to build a decentralized network of fusion reactors. That would in turn create an energy grid that is far more resilient than the more centralized power grid that is typical of what we see today.Of course, that’s if the technology can be deployed economically at scale.That’s why General Fusion’s deal with the UKAEA is so important. It will enable the company to build a reactor, get it up and running, and then assess whether the benefits outweigh the costs.If so, all that’s left to do is build more reactors. General Fusion would have no problem securing the funding it needs once its technology has been proven.In fact, the company already has an impressive list of backers, which includes Jeff Bezos – and yours truly. And I even got in at a better price than Bezos on this one.And perhaps most exciting, this deal is moving at an accelerated timeline. General Fusion will start building its reactor next year.From there, the company expects to have the reactor operational within three years. It should be fully functional by 2025.As we’ve discussed before,We are no more than a few years away from the first fusion reactors producing more energy than that required to power them. That means limitless, clean, and essentially “free” energy for all.","105,675 followers",Dave Consiglio,4.5K,6.8K,91.6M,2021,https://www.quora.com/How-close-are-we-to-achieving-nuclear-fusion-At-what-point-will-it-become-a-possible-source-of-energy
