Our team at Grammarly has compiled a handy list of common grammatical errors to help make your writing accurate, clear, and professional.Ambiguous (“Squinting”) modifiersA squinting modifier is a misplaced modifier that, because of its location in a sentence, could modify either the phrase that precedes it or the one that follows it. In the example sentence, is the subject listening to music slowly or slowly getting a headache? To correct a squinting modifier, move its position in the sentence to clarify to the reader which word you intend to modify.Misuse of lie/layIf you plan to place or put an object somewhere, such as a plate on a table, you should use “lay.” If you intend to stretch out on a bed for a nap, you should use “lie.” The verb “lie” is an intransitive verb, which means it does not need an object. The transitive verb “lay” requires an object.It may take some getting used to this “lay” or “lie” business; after all, misuse of these verbs is common. But if you remember to lay down your fork before you’re full, then you won’t have to lie down later from overeating.Comma splicesHe was very hungry, so he ate a whole pizza.To splice means to connect or join. When a writer joins two independent sentences with a comma instead of separating them with a period or coordinating conjunction, that’s a comma splice.The comma has its jobs to do, but connecting two independent sentences isn’t one of them. Besides, the period gets testy when his sister, the comma, steals his thunder. Periods have their jobs, and so do commas, but never the twain shall meet—unless it’s in the form of a semicolon. Semicolons can also take the place of a coordinating conjunction, such as “and,” “but,” or “so,” among others.Run-on sentencesRun-on sentences, also known as fused sentences, occur when two complete sentences are squashed together without using a coordinating conjunction or proper punctuation, such as a period or a semicolon. Run-on sentences can be short or long. A long sentence isn’t necessarily a run-on sentence.To avoid run-on sentences, see if there is more than one idea communicated by two or more independent clauses. In our examples, there are two complete sentences:Example:Example:Both sentences are complete ideas by themselves; therefore, use a semicolon or a period to indicate that they are separate independent clauses.Using “could of” instead of “could have”“Could have” is always correct; “could of” never is. Writers probably make this grammar gaffe because, when we speak, the contraction “could’ve” sounds an awful lot like “could of.”TautologiesTautologies express the same thing twice with different words. In our example, the word “made” implies that Jack used his own two hands to create the pail. The prepositional phrase “with his own hands” creates a redundancy. Once you know what they are, it’s fun to discover tautologies: dilapidated ruins, close proximity, added bonus, large crowd...The list goes on and on!After reading through this list of common grammatical mistakes, you might be wondering how to remember all these rules as you write.

We assume that it’s normal to go to bed to give birth while hooked up to monitors and most women labour on their backs. From experience, lying on your back in labour is extremely painful, while staying upright was much easier.Women who have given birth in a hospital setting, labouring in bed, and at home or in a birthing centre, say the one where they were free to move or position themselves as they wanted was far less painful.Rather than looking at a technology which will reduce the pain of childbirth in the future, maybe we should be looking at techniques which will do that now.","5,084 followers",Bobby Tatro,3.2K,2.2K,45.6M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Does-the-current-state-of-technology-offer-viable-options-for-world-leaders-to-commit-to-meaningful-Co2-reduction-targets-at-the-upcoming-summit-in-Paris

Self-driving vehicles, for example, rely heavily on IoT devices to navigate roadways and traffic.Many businesses are now using IoT devices to build and maintain smarter buildings that utilize connected HVAC infrastructure and automated door locks, thermostats, smoke detectors, and more.Green Benefits - Carbon FootprintInvesting in the 5G network and expanding the use of IoT in business will also help to reduce businesses' carbon footprint. The reputation of a business depends on how a business reduces the harm to the environment and the climate.#2. Artificial IntelligenceAI is already a part of our lives. We use everyday smartphones and their applications, including artificial intelligence software such as Apple’s Siri and Google Assistant.With AI, your smartphone can be used to measure distances and to simulate the way that a piece of furniture will look in your living room. Voice and object recognition are two features of AI that are now common in tablets and smartphones.Artificial Intelligence is also being adopted by businesses to cut costs, and to help automate processes. Industries that can expect to see an increasing amount of AI support include:MarketingAI is used to get data from online users or your target audience. By capturing a user’s online behavior, including search and browsing history, AI can determine which online ads will be most relevant for your target audience.eCommerceAI in the world of eCommerce and online shopping has many benefits, including online chatbots, intelligent product recommendations, and sophisticated inventory management.SalesAI helps sales teams to improve forecasting, predict market trends, and improve customer communications.
