He posted this to his LinkedIn feed earlier today.Paul is a respected name in the DNS space, running the F-root and the ISC which supportsLet’s think a bit about how DNS works. Super simplified version here, be warned. When you want to access a computer by name versus IP address explicitly, you invoke your local resolver. Which when given a domain name, will attempt to create a fully qualified domain name if it’s not already, or if it is, attempt to resolve it - to turn the name into an IP address. The resolver maintains a local cache of names it’s already looked up - in addition to this cache potentially running an LRU algorithm to conserve space, it is bound by the rules of DNS to expire entries which have hit their time-to-live. So the name might or might not be there.If you don’t have a local hit, you pass it up-line to another resolver. That applies recursively - the rule is that if you send it to a smart resolver, if the data is not in its cache, it’s supposed to send to the Start of Authority for the domain. But if that SOA record is not in the cache, you send to the SOA for the TLD - so for “splorg.com” you would send to the SOA for “.com”. And if you didn’t have that in your cache, you’d send to the “root servers” who could help you out with the top level SOAs.Back in the day, when Mockapetris architected all this, links were slow and memory expensive. It was pretty common for - in the interests of preserving bandwidth - the TTLs to be pretty long (because stuff didn’t change hardly ever) and for each organization to run a local DNS hub, to which all campus connected computers would point.The cache could wind up being deep - the DNS implementation that I wrote for DEC’s VMS operating system effectively had unlimited cache, as I kept a working set of A records in physical memory and had a fast database in virtual memory for everything else. But sooner or later you had to kick requests up-line. It was pretty common to hit the first level resolvers on a frequent basis, the root resolvers almost never.This all worked because you were doing this to resolve stuff that didn’t change much - email servers, remote systems you’d log into or copy files to/from. And then the World Wide Web happened….Chaos pretty much ensued. Domain proliferation happened, and as browsers became more sophisticated, requests were run in parallel versus serialized, and as content proliferation also happened, a “simple web page” might be pulling assets from over 50 discrete sources. The number of DNS queries that your local computer was doing increased asymptotically, and the impact of queries taking too long became more significant.To combat that (and this is circa 2000-ish), Internet service providers started running their own very deep cache DNS resolvers. And your cable modem which provided network translation service, and ran DHCP for your home LAN, would “prefer” the DNS resolvers of the ISP, over pointing at root.This meant two things: first, they got to aggregate a lot of DNS requests, meaning that odds were really good that you wouldn’t have a cache miss. Second, if they wanted to, they could know a whole bunch about what you were doing with your computer. Without even bothering to snoop your actual traffic, the fact that they could see all of your DNS queries meant that they knew you looked at Powerball results on Saturday morning, went to “Nuns and Nazis” every evening about 11pm, and visited “Susie’s Sweet Scent Candles” every 2nd and 16th.That’s… potentially awkward. But not lethal. Unless your ISP happens to be the government and you happen to be in a repressive regime. In which case going to the How To Freedom website or hitting the how to apply for asylum pages at the US State Department might prove injurious to your health.To stop “corporate snooping” and institutional reigns of terror, Google, Cloudflare, OpenDNS and a few other organizations set up free and open DNS servers (starting circa 2006-ish). You can manually set your DNS to 8.8.8.8 or 1.1.1.1 or 208.67.222.222 or whatever and know that your DNS queries won’t be seen and cached by a more local DNS server.All of which is well and good, but…. well… you know… the operator can stillThat’s what DoH solves for. You run DNS over an HTTPS tunnel to an endpoint, and thence it’s unpacked and routed to the designated DNS server. So now, no one can either scope out your DNS queries at the resolver, or sniff the wire and see your DNS packets. Until you get to the DNS resolver.Sounds great, right?OK… sure. Except.What if you want control over your corporate network? What if you really want to know what your employees are actually doing? Because….well… reasons. Might be incipient paranoia. Might be a last vestige of being a server hugger. Might be valid, as in “you’re not supposed to be accessing a whole bunch of restricted sites from work on a work computer”.Or what if you’re a parent, and have been running a DNS proxy as part of your parental controls software?In any event, if you’re running DoH your internal network monitoring software has no clue what’s going on. Looks like any other encrypted HTTPS stream, completely opaque. You can tell that it’s SOMETHING, but not what. (Note: VPNs pose the same issue)So in late October, the Mozilla Foundation, which supports the Firefox browser and is terrifically more aggressive about promoting privacy, decided to enable DoH by default.You can turn it off. But by default, it’s opt-out. Also in their policies: they don’t allow Cloudflare in particular (and “others”) to accumulate personally identifying information. In theory, aggregated traffic is less susceptible to that sort of identification than directly connecting to a DNS resolver, but it can still happen.BTW, you can also enable this in Chrome. But it’s not a default.In addition to just flipping a bunch of people out that they did this, there’s a whole deeper layer: who, exactly, does the deeper resolving, and what do they know about you?Note that the Google and Cloudflare DNS services are fully monetized - these people use your information to make money off of knowing what you’re doing. Commercially, they’re a lot less likely to give a shit about it (but that “Nuns and Nazis” thing might get you pop up ads from “Nurses and Narwhals”). But there’s still a big matter of “someone, somewhere, has to be able to map this result to this requestor, and that knowledge is potentially power”.So who gets to know? And who decides?That’s one of the reasons that corporate users want to rope it all back into a server they control. And why DoH is potentially a problem.For users out there in userland, just doing your thing, not with a corporate computer, not on a corporate network, (and not a kid on a parentally monitored network), DoH looks like a pretty massive win.For security minded users with a touch more paranoia, you’ll want more control over where your DNS is unpacked, and you probably are using a VPN anyway. But you’re adept enough to reconfigure to suit.For corporate users, if you’re up to no good this is a win.For corporate admins, if you’re trying to find people up to no good, this is a nightmare.And for all the parties trying to figure out how to capture, aggregate and monetize your browsing habits? The middle men, the ISPs, they’re out of luck. The other guys? Could wind up being an interesting time - the battle is far from over.","36,309 followers",Stan Hanks,607,7.7K,65.7M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-problem-or-controversy-over-DNS-over-HTTPS-DoH

For example all the past (the moments you had a conflict with other, memories that you failed, etc), worry about the future, etc. These kinds of thoughts make us hard to put into action.

Leverage the power of habitsIf you build habits, your mind will recognize the pattern. For example, when you wash your teeth, you’re doing automatically without using any significant amounts of focus, energy, and motivation.Building productive habits is like teaching your brain how to behave at different yet specific times.Related Reading:If you find them helpful,","4,796 followers",Genius Turner,1.6K,147,10M,2022,https://www.quora.com/How-can-I-make-my-brain-sharper-smarter-and-lightning-fast

There are many simple tips and tricks that can make your brain faster, sharper, and smarter and they usually involve lifestyle and dietary changes alongside some behavioral traits that can flex the grey matter.Each of us has been gifted with a smart and amazing brain but most of us do not utilize it to its full potential. Since we all know that what we do not use is likely to wither and waste away, it is very important to do stuff that can make the brain smarter and faster. Making your brain smarter and faster doesn’t always mean that you have to keep studying or become a reclusive bookworm. There are many simple tips and tricks that can make your brain faster, sharper, and smarter and they usually involve lifestyle and dietary changes alongside some behavioral traits that can flex the grey matter. So here are the easy ways to make your brain faster and smarter.1. Work your memoryMemory is the most important part of a smarter and faster brain. For students, whatever you read during the day, make sure you read it immediately at night before sleep. This is because; the brain consolidates all of this new information during rest. This allows the brain to store the things you read before sleeping in its limbic area. Memory can also be developed through sights, sounds, touch, and smells. Our sense organs are connected intricately to the brain’s limbic area. So any particular sound (songs) or smells (aromas of cooking, the fragrance of perfumes or essential oils, etc) can transform you to a different time and place. Many students actually learn faster while diffusing certain aroma-therapeutic oils (2. Make associationsYour brain helps you memorize and recall things by using 3 concepts – associations, imagination, and location. So, if you wish to remember the 5 Great Lakes, you can use the acronym HOMES to remember Huron, Ontario, Michigan, Erie, and Superior.3. Make goalsMake achievable goals; they need not be huge ones. The important thing is to try and do a bit every day. Just keep at it and your job every day is to ensure not breaking the habit.4. Eat foods that boost brain powerThe best foods for the brain are omega 3 fish oil, proteins, B complex, Curcumin, Ginseng, and Gingko Biloba. Take these supplements under the guidance of your doctor. Avoid coffee and tea. Choose foods with Low GI such as cereals, brown rice, fruits, vegetables, legumes, etc.5. Think positive and stay happyPeople who think positive are naturally more creative and their brain is also more receptive to ideas making it sharper and smarter.6. MeditationPeople who meditate are likelier to have a sharper, smarter brain according to this7. Play brain gamesTop brain games8. Do mental mathInstead of whipping out the calculator, do a little mental math while you are at the grocery store. Try and total up the amount for items purchased. These simple tips can keep your brain sharper.9. Read every dayReading can do amazing things for your mind and brain. According to a10. Listen to musicMusic might not make your brain smarter and sharper, but it can certainly give it a11. LaughMan can be distinguished from other animals because of his ability to laugh. So laugh every day for boosting your brainpower.12. Sleep wellA13. Too much technology hurts your brain powerAccording to s Dr. Sandra Bond Chapman, a neuroscientist, too much of technology is making our brain attention deficit. So slow down, keep your ‘smart’ devices switched off from time to time, and certainly do not check your email before bed.14. Slow downThe fast-paced lives we lead and make our kids lead is not good for the brain. Slow down, dig deeper and take a break from time to time.15. Avoid multi-taskingDo one task at a time always. Whatever you do, do it 100%.16. Stretch and challenge your brainTeach your mind to construct deeper level, abstract ideas. For example, when you just attend a meet, try and construct a newspaper-headline describing it.17. Live your passionWhen you do something you enjoy, the brain’s juices motivate it into becoming stronger and smarter.

At the time, I didn't know who his father was.When I was a kid I used to skip school, hide behind my house until my parents left, and then go off to play chess with John Nash.Not THE John Nash, the Nobel Prize winner who also had schizophrenia.We would go over to his house (where his father and mother also lived) and play all day and then I would go home before my parents got home from work.The son also had schizophrenia and I sort of could tell but we focused our days on playing chess all day. At the time, I didn't know who his father was.Maybe not.John, the son, disappeared and we lost touch. I last saw him I think in 1988.Maybe they are mentally strong. Maybe not.Often many of us are very good at constructing masks and it is never really known what is deep inside of us. What we keep hidden for fear of death if others were to find out.But I can tell you what is most in common with some of the people I have encountered and maybe then you can tell me if you think these are qualities of mentally strong people. I would like to know.All of these things...anyone can do. Anyone can learn to be mentally strong and change the world as a result.Wealth, health, success, strong relationships, and freedom seem to be byproducts of the traits listed below.Here's my trick:I list, for each item, 1-10 on where I rank and then I add them up. So somewhere between 0 and 100.Then every day I try to improve by 1.A) RELATIONSHIPSThe mentally strong people I know, the ones who have achieved the most in life, have ALL had incredibly strong relationships.Friends, spouses, partners, and so on. I've interviewed billionaires, well known movie directors, athletes, scientists, artists. All have believed in the saying ""you are the average of the five people you spend your time with"".If you build up strong relationships, it means they are supporting your ideas, adding to them, helping you execute them, and not constantly fighting you or dragging you down.B) HONESTYThis is not religious but math. The brain takes up 2% of the body's mass and burns up 25% of the body's calories each day. One in four calories you eat goes to fuel your brain.When you lie, one side of your brain has to deal with one set of lies. And the other side of the brain has to deal with the other set of lies. So to be at optimal mental strength you now need twice as many calories. This is impossible.So the best way to be mentally strong is to be honest so all of the fuel in your body can be used efficiently at propelling your brain from strength to strength instead of fighting off the attacks on your weaknesses.C) IT'S NOT ABOUT ME, IT'S ABOUT YOUWhenever a girl broke up with me, it never seemed to be about me. That's ok. That was a line to make me feel better.I guess I should be grateful for the many people who tried to make me feel better by blaming themselves.But true mentally strong people constantly are focused on others. They are solving problems for other people.They don't think, ""How can I make money"" since money is just pieces of paper fueled by a mythological story.They think, ""What are problems in the world that I can solve?""They think, for instance, healthcare is a mess. And since we all know ""prevention is the cure"", how can I develop a product that helps with prevention and diagnostics.And, if you were a genius like Elizabeth Holmes, you would drop out of Stanford, make a company called Theranos, and do exactly that.That is just one example.Mentally strong people are always solving other people's problems. The problems of the individual get solved as a byproduct of solving the problems of the many.D) READINGI've interviewed over 150 people now for my podcast. Here is one question nobody ever hesitates on: What are the last books you've read?Do you know why mentally strong people read? I have my guess.We all have one life to live. But when you read, you get to absorb the curated life of another person in just a few days.So if you read a lot, your one brain can hold onto the critical points of potentially thousands of other incredible people. You can bathe in their lives and come out a stronger you.I asked Freeway Rick Ross, the largest drug dealer ever, what books he read in prison that turned around his life.He couldn't read or write before prison. But then he taught himself. He told me instantly: ""As A Man Thinketh"", ""The Richest Man in Babylon"", and ""Think and Grow Rich"".I asked Tim Ferriss, author of The Four Hour Work Week. He said, ""Radical Acceptance"", ""Essentialism"", and ""The Effective Executive"".All 150 people I have interviewed gave answers instantly. I have no doubt if I ask them again next week they will all have different answers. I have never met a mentally strong person who wasn't a voracious reader.E) HEALTHBecause the brain burns so many calories, you have to have health in other areas of your life.It's hard to be mentally strong, to be creative, to execute, to change the world, if you are sick in bed.This is not being judgmental towards those sick in bed. Sometimes we just get sick. We can't help it.But almost everyone I've ever dealt with in business or in life who has gone on to greater and great successes all acknowledged the importance of constant healthy transformation of their bodies.This doesn't mean lift 500 pounds. It means sleep eight hours a day. It means eat well (which simply means: less on processed foods, more on vegetables, and exchange your 15 inch plates for 10 inch plates), and move.Movement doesn't mean running a marathon. It might just mean walking a lot.Our paleo ancestors got their exercise from walking and climbing on their daily hunt for food. This kept them healthy enough to be our ancestors so I thank them every day for that by following their model.F) CURIOSITYIf you are talking to someone and they say something interesting but you don't understand, do you interrupt them and ask them what they mean?Sometimes I'm afraid to ask questions because I don't want to seem stupid or I don't want someone to be annoyed at me or I'm feeling shy.The only way to learn new things is to ask questions and be curious. Find the people who inspire your curiosity because those are the ones you will most learn from.Then ask them questions.The more stupid you feel asking a question, the more you HAVE to ask the question. If you feel shy asking one question, then ask TWO questions.Every mentally strong person has this one thing in common: the things they most remember that has changed their lives have been the answers to questions they asked.If they never asked those questions, their lives would not have changed.G) LEARN, SAY, REPEATWe think we learn in school. We take a class and a brilliant professor gives a lecture and we supposedly leave the class smarter.But here is the science. Within 45 minutes of leaving a class, college students have already forgotten 80% of what was said in the class. By the next day, they have forgotten just about 100%.Here's how to remember: First you hear something. If it interests you, write it down as a note (carry a notebook. I carry a waiter's pad because they are cheap).Then use it in a conversation within an hour. Then use it in a conversation the next day and then the next.NOW there is a decent chance you have learned it. Because you build various connections in your brain that have now been programmed with that nugget of information. That's how learning takes place. Mentally strong people learn how to learn.H) THE IDEA MUSCLEPeople say ""ideas are a dime a dozen"". This is simply not true. Ideas are ""a dime for three"".Go ahead and try. Come up with 10 ideas for surprises for your spouse's next anniversary. The first three are easy. But, for me, then it gets harder and by #7 I'm counting the list over and over again to see if I reached 10.If you get hit by a bike and are stuck in bed for two weeks recovering, then when you leave the bed your leg muscles are so atrophied you need therapy to walk again.The same with the idea muscle. It needs to be exercised every day or it will atrophy.How do you exercise it? Pick a theme, any theme will do, and write down ten ideas a day. Every day.I can tell you that when I was broke and suicidal and scared I started doing this. My life has changed 100% every six months since then. It's been incredible. Like magic.I wrote this and shared this with others. Now I get emails from people every six months telling me how their lives have changed.When I was interviewing the rapper Coolio he told me he wrote lyrics down every day for 17 years before he had his first hit. A year after his first hit he had the best selling song on the entire planet.When he described that song to me he described which elements from which musicians who came before him that he meshed together to create his hit.This is called ""idea sex"". When you are an expert in one category and an expert in another then you are the greatest in the world at the intersection.What about execution? Execution ideas are just a subset of regular ideas. If you have an idea you want to execute on, then your idea list the next day should be, ""What are the ten next steps I need to take?""Should you then take them? I don't know. Mentally strong people probably make those lists 100 times a year and only need to execute on one of them to change the world.Give yourself permission to have bad ideas. It's only through diligent mining of the universe inside of you that you find the gems that will light up the world.I) PERMISSIONMentally strong people give themselves permission.Why did the Google guys come up with the 8th search engine and think theirs was special? Why did Elizabeth Holmes think it was ok to drop out of the best school in the country to pursue a business dream?Why did Henry Ford, after failing twice at car companies, think it was a good idea to start a third car company. Why did the Wright Brothers think it was ok to make a plane with spare parts from their bicycle shop when the government was spending tens of millions?They all gave themselves permission to do something that has never been done before.They all gave themselves permission to have many bad ideas.They all gave themselves permission to risk their reputation and the forked tongues of the people who would fight them.They gave themselves permission to slip and fall and get up and dust themselves off and try again. And again. And again. And again.They gave themselves permission to love something so strong that every neuron on their brain would light up and conspire to make their dreams come true.If you don't give yourself permission to create a new world, chances are nobody else will.J) PRESENCEI regret so many things from my past. Maybe that one time I lost all of my money, I could've used it to help my father live a little bit longer than he did.And all of the time I am anxious. Will I give a good speech. Will this business I invest in work out? I hope it does. I don't want to go broke again.Time traveling seems exciting but it isn't. You can time travel all your life and then suddenly you are dead without ever having lived in the present moment, the only moment that exists.Whenever mentally strong people find themselves time traveling they take a step back. They said, ""What can I do right now to help others"" instead of wasting time regretting the past or worrying about the future.Worry and regret never solves tomorrow's problems and only drains away energy from today.Presence will always solve this moment's problems.Mentally strong people solve problems, love people, are curious, stay healthy, have idea sex, are honest with you, and make the world a better place.I hope each day I can improve a little on each level. And if I run into you on the street, maybe we can wink at each other.

26,"I don’t think people mock Russian engines. To the contrary - they are in high demand.

The Soyuz capsule used a paper tape reader with the commands for re-entry punched onto paper tape.The Apollo computer was a wonder of engineering - really the start of the whole computer revolution.But the Soviet system was cheap - incredibly reliable - easy to fix with no more tools than a swiss army knife - and it worked.The Soyuz capsule remains the most flown - and demonstrably safest - human launch system in the world (although I think they did replace the paper tape!).But other stories are just nonsense. On that same mission, it was claimed that the famous “space pens” that could write upside down and in zero-g were developed “at a cost of millions” by NASA - but those clever/unsophisticed Russians just brought along a pencil.Sadly (because it’s a funny story) - it’s just not true. NASA didn’t pay a penny for the development of their pens - they were developed by Fisher - and not for space use particularly - and they bought a case of them for not much money.Similarly, the Soviets didn’t use pencils because the graphite dust they produce in zero g would be hazardous to inhale and could short out mechanical switches and such.But these kinds of stories about “clever-but-unsophisticated” Russian technology are often incorrect - and only partially justified.Sometimes “built like a tank” is a complement - other times, not so much so.If you’re buying a pickup truck for construction work - then “Built like a tank” is a strong recommendation…but I don’t think you want your sportscar to be built that way!Sheer brute-force approaches do have their value.","16,473 followers",Chris Everett,766,11K,79.1M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-problem-or-controversy-over-DNS-over-HTTPS-DoH

The Boeing (now ULA) Delta IV uses all American engines and so did the Titan IV before it. Like the Americans, the Japanese take great pride in building their own rocket engines and do a fine job. China is doing much the same.Elon Musk is entitled to his opinion. He is an accomplished, well educated man but not necessarily the top expert on the subject. He is or was wealthy enough to attempt to buy Russian rocket engines a few decades ago which has now become a moot point as his company, thanks to the hired experts and hard work of his employees, builds and develops their own rocket engines.Other people share his view that many Russian engines are the best in the world. Among several other experts, this view is not shared as American, European and Japanese engines have performance aspects comparable if not superior to a similar Russian or Ukrainian engine. You really need to consider that all rocket engines aren’t built for the same purpose. The Russians have never built anything to compare to the performance, reliability and ongoing legacy of SSME (RS-25D) or the RL10 upper stage. Many people today weren’t even born when those man-rated engines first flew and still fly today.Some of the shade being thrown at Russian engines is motivated by national pride. Some of it is a bit of self-loathing at the poor decision-making of the American government and corporate decision makers around the turn of fhe millenium. When the Cold War ended ten years prior, Western nations sought to acquire well-made former Soviet rocket engines at bargain basement prices rather than invest in their own engine manufacturers. This short-term thinking motivated by misguided politics and economics which has had a long lasting adverse impact on the American aerospace industry despite abundant warnings by many. Ironically, it was Elon Musk (SpaceX) and now a growing cadre of other companies that are reversing that trend by restsrting domestic design and manufacturing of rocket engines. Firefly is a notable exception.When comparing anything, you must first establish an objective basis of comparison then gather facts from reputable sources not necessarily just absorb the opinion of a celebrity. Don’t take only my word for it either. Ask around.","14,900 followers",Krister Sundelin,1K,23.8K,89.8M,2021,https://www.quora.com/How-can-I-make-my-brain-sharper-smarter-and-lightning-fast
28,"The question makes a wrong assumption. No one except ignorant people in online forums mock the Russian RD180 engine.Rather, it is considered one of the best in its class and very reliable. That said, there are now other engines that work as well (such as the SpaceX Merlin used in the Falcon 9)","66,708 followers",Dima Vorobiev,2.5K,4.2K,139.1M,2021,https://www.quora.com/How-can-I-make-my-brain-sharper-smarter-and-lightning-fast

He stresses Russian engineering to keep the pressure on, but he's using his social media platforms to pump his stock, build his marketing, sell more launches, and get people to point and look.The US mocks Russian hardware for very reasonable reasons. There's a lot of garbage flying around, and there's a few cool things they have, but to starve the beast, you compete with it.","19,202 followers",Jim Cantrell,15.2K,0,0,2021,https://www.quora.com/How-can-I-make-my-brain-sharper-smarter-and-lightning-fast
30,"It’s super important to remember that in the main,There’s a super instructive book,Marco Fuxa’It’s super important to remember that in the main,There’s a super instructive book,Marco Fuxa’Enron’s key value creation engine was processing information - usually information that other’s hadn’t thought to correlate - and turning it into probability and forward risk profiles. Let me give you an example.In electricity generation, there are plants that are far too expensive to operate constantly - too many emissions, too inefficient, bad supply chain, whatever. However, they can put serious power onto the grid when needed, so you keep them around. These “peaker” plants are forward indicators about a lot of things. People generally know that, but no one thought to do anything about it.A group at Enron made these devices that put a long range infrared camera, a tiny computer, and a cell phone in a box with a battery. They’d then lease space in someone’s tree, and point it at a peaker plant, and calibrate it. When the plant fired, and the smokestacks got hot, the cell would call a number, and hang up. Every so often someone would come by, pay the rent, and swap the battery.Enron now had info that was super useful, in real time. No one else had it. Think that might have made a difference in how they looked at forward prices on oil, electricity, carbon offsets, you name it?? Damn right it did.That’s just the tip of the iceberg. If there was a piece of information that anyone thought might be interesting, useful, valuable, eventually someone would find a way to get it - in real time - and drop it into the forward risk calculations, and it would come out in pricing.They also did amazing things with contract novation, basically buying long-term out-of-the-money contracts from customers so that they could sell them new fancier in-the-money contracts - and then, somehow, always manage to sell the out-of-money contracts to less desirable customers with even MORE out-of-the-money contracts.Broadband was a huge arbitrage play. My goal was to create an actual forward market for bandwidth, and to allow that to development of derivatives and synthetic derivatives for managing risk. To do that, I created a naturally long position (but much, much thinner than anyone else’s network by an order of magnitude) of fiber in the ground. And I created a huge naturally short position of “science fiction” bandwidth intensive services - yes, video on demand at broadcast quality, in 1998; yes, the ability to slave two AVIDs together across the country and co-edit live broadcast video; yes, the ability to have fully live redundant data centers separated only by speed of light.The dynamic tension between the two was the wedge used to jump start the market. We had real progress being made, hundreds of millions of dollars of bandwidth buys we had ordered, hundreds of millions of sells, that we were driving through our commodity exchange.And it all blew up, because Skilling pinned the credit available to the company to the price of ENE, needed to boost the stock price to raise the ceiling, and went out with… what did the DOJ say? Materially misleading, yeah, that’s it. Materially misleading information to the market.When Blockbuster unravelled - because Blockbuster didn’t have permission from the studios to do the deal they wanted to do with us - and had to be backed out of the 10Q, the questions about that caused a lot of even shadier stuff (like the Nigerian barges Marco talked about) to show up and the whole thing exploded.But man, before the wheels started coming off the bus, it was an insanely creative place. Incredibly bright people making impossible things happen. Hey, let’s create a synthetic derivative crossing weather to carbon offsets! Or since we have that, corn! Or hey, maybe there’s a soybean/carbon offset hybrid…Crazy stuff.I learned an incredible amount there. I lived and died by the RAROC process - risk adjusted return on capital - plus actual mark-to-market which is unbelievably useful if you use it for good, not evil.From the inside, it was no surprise to keep getting “Most Innovative Company” awards. It wasn’t products, it was mindset, and lifestyle.",UNKNOWN,Cory A. Martin,2.6K,956,7.8M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-problem-or-controversy-over-DNS-over-HTTPS-DoH
