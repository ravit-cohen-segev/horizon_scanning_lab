If its relational database then you can go ahead with SQLite, but if its like json or nosql database where you want to store data as document then you can use Realm. Personally used both and find Realm performance is better that SQLite, but again depends on how your data is structured.In case you want to use cloud you can explore Firebase or CouchDB or AWS DynamoDB depending on what you are looking for (i.e. read heavy or write heavy) operations on your data.",254 followers,Kenny Wyland,873,0,0,2019,https://www.quora.com/I-am-developing-an-app-in-Android-and-later-that-would-be-extended-for-iOS-as-well-What-should-be-my-choice-of-database-considering-current-technology-and-upcoming-technology-as-well-As-per-Google-I-should-use
