A few others (from a total of 40 Mark I ordered by IAF in 2005) are not passed yet the tests of the military.

It has all of the information inside that DNA on how to make another egg. A chicken is just an eggs way or making another egg. That's the only reason for the chickens existence.The fact that a chicken looks like a chicken is due to the fact that over the millions of years that that egg has been creating more eggs, the realities of nature - and competition for resources from other eggs has resulted in a chicken shaped solution to egg making.So the answer to what came first, the chicken or the egg, the answer is simple and self evident - the egg.Humans are just like this. We are a different solution that nature carved into the DNA of an egg - that just happened to come up with an alternative solution.The DNA within us, which we can consider levers to our behaviour are focussed entirely on things which make it more likely that we will create more eggs.Those levers came before our intelligence was particularly advanced so we feel these levers, rather than think them. The core part of our brain as we know, is instinctive and emotional.We enjoy watching a scary movie because that core part of the brain, which is the fastest and works without conscious thought - makes us jump when something scary happens. Our flight response we then dampen down when our slower intelligent brain steps in to reassure us that we're not in danger.That feeling of doing something risky is innate within us, and we often get pleasure from it, because in the past we would need to be adventurous and curious in order to find new resources and discover new habitat.So yes while the most obvious expressions of those levers are pleasure and pain, they are a lot more subtle than that. We also desire companionship because being in a group helps us defend the offspring and increases our survivability. We desire protein, sugar and salt readily available now from a McDonald's but these resources were rare when our genetics went about building that craving into us, and a desire to locate it. Our sexual appitites are all obviously about creating offspring, and our desire for self-preservation is exactly a need that our genes have expressed in us, to survive in order to make and fertilise eggs and protect the offspring.The reason we die, is that after we’ve had and raised children - there is nothing more that the eggs can do to help us. Evolution can battle things that occur to us when we're younger, so it repairs cells, replaces lost eggs, heals damage - but it can't do this after about 30 because we've already made the new eggs at that stage.So yes we are certainly motivated almost exclusively by desires/fears that run along the lines of increasing survivability, operating within a social group, finding a mate, having offspring and protecting them into adulthood.That includes then power, money, influence, sex, greed, selfishness, disgust, love, jealousy, hatred, altruism, tenderness, play fighting, aggression, lust and so on.They're not all pleasure and pain though are they, but they are all emotive.There are other things we do like music, poetry, drama and comedy though which are things which we've used our intelligence to discover that we can use to evoke the emotions in us.We like to feel peaceful and unafraid and so a painting of a summers day, and things unwinding at a slow pace in a rural settings might make us feel that way.We like to feel controlled aggression without personal danger - because men especially are designed to fight and hunt and kill - so we enjoy a computer game of simulated violence, same as many people enjoy simulated sex in the shape of pornography.Drama can excite us because we are social and feel power and intrigue. Being shutout is almost the worst human feeling, and so we love watching soap operas where we get to watch the the goings on, but without the pressure of actually having to be there and participate.If you think of almost any human behaviour, you can work out where it comes from.However we are animals, and nature ensures that we are all varied and we are not exact. So someone can equally have desires which are misdirected versions of the ones we're talking about. A phycopath or a serial killer, a loaner - but we know that these are outliers and are noticeable exactly because they don't fit in with the goals our eggs have for us.","115,128 followers",Daveed Phoenix,2.2K,9.9K,160.6M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Is-Tejas-a-world-class-air-fighter

I was repeatedly awoken in the middle of the night due to nightmares to find any number of siblings in my bed. I couldn't study at home because the word quiet didn't exist in our home. We weren't allowed to lock the bathroom door because my sister had locked it so many times for so long that the entire family was made late for events and school and work.When I moved out on my own to my first place without roommates at the age of twenty five I lasted exactly one month and 26 days before I bought a pet. The quiet in my apartment was driving me crazy. I bought a cat. I am an idiot. I know nothing about cats and now she is 9 years old. I still know nothing about cats but I know everything there is to know about her.I was just telling my friends not three days ago how much I still love living alone.
