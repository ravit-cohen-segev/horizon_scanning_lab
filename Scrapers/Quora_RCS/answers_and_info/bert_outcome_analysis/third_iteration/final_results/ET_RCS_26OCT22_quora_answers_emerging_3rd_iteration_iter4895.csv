1,"Thanks for the A2A.In the near term only an iPhone can replace an iPhone. The brand is far too popular and entrenched into the minds of consumers for it to be anything else. Also, the form factor really can’t change all that much from what it is now. I suppose there could be some technological advances that could allow translucent screens or even projection technology, but the device itself needs to be a certain size in order to be both easy to cary yet hard to lose. Modern smart phones are already on the edge of not qualifying for “hard to lose” so they can’t get much smaller.(SidenoteThanks for the A2A.In the near term only an iPhone can replace an iPhone.

Enhancements that connect directly to your brain will allow you to see better, hear better, and communicate over any distance hands free. These devices will have a brand identity but they will not be “branded” in the conventional sense since there would be no way for people to see a logo or an iconic piece of hardware such as the white EarPods or AirPods.Instead, I expect the branding would be on the communication itself. Think about how an operating system is branded. With macOS the Apple logo is always in the upper left corner of the menu bar. I can easily imagine companies branding their logo onto their virtual presence in some way so the recipients of those communications know what software was used to produce them. For audio communication, the branding will be in the form of the audio tones they use that are specific to that company.",0 followers,Tim Ventura,765,1.1K,11.5M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-technology-will-replace-Unix-and-Oracle-PL-SQL

But these are all desktop applications. P2P is a very new addition to the web – it has only been around for a few years, so most people don’t even know P2P is possible on the web.Imagine a video site like YouTube, where visitors help to host the site's content. The more people that use a WebTorrent-powered website, the faster and more resilient it becomes.Source:The technology that enables all this is calledTo enable high-quality, low-latency connections, P2P needed to be added to the browser.With WebRTC, data can be transferred directly from one browser to another. This is kind of like a WebSocket, but it’s peer-to-peer. WebSocket was designed for communication to/from a server, i.e. a client-server model. WebRTC, on the other hand, allows direct browser-to-browser communication.This is revolutionary.This will enable next-generation applications in healthcare, education, science, and more. WebTorrent is just one example of what’s possible.WebRTCBut will this replace BitTorrent?That remains to be seen. But the advantages of WebTorrent are compelling:One more question... will this get adopted by the community?WebTorrent follows the BitTorrent spec as closely as possible, to make it easy for existing BitTorrent clients to add support for WebTorrent. We believe that WebTorrent is the logical next-step for modern torrent clients to adopt.In the early days, BitTorrent used TCP as its transport protocol. Later,“Web peers” (browser-based torrent peers) will make the BitTorrent network stronger by adding millions of new peers, and spreading BitTorrent to dozens of new use cases.Additional Links","5,910 followers",Costya Perepelitsa,2.1K,572,5.3M,2016,https://www.quora.com/What-will-replace-the-iPhone

From September to mid-November the price made a slight recovery to $0.003443. However since then, the price has decreased to $0.002334 by 6 December.BitTorrent overviewThe total supply of BTT is 990,000,000,000 and there is a current circulating supply of 932,497,500,000, according to CoinGeckoThe current market cap of BitTorrent stands a little over $2.3bn as of 6 December. According to CoinMarketCap, BTT is ranked number 56.Over the course of 2021, the BitTorrent's price had risen over 1,000%.But how do these figures affect a BitTorrent coin price prediction?Let’s take a look at what analysts think…BTT price prediction – Expert opinionIt is important to bear in mind when considering predictions, that while these can be a helpful indicator of the direction the price may move, they should be viewed as possibilities rather than absolutes. This is especially the case when looking at long term forecasts, as these can sometimes be completely off the mark. This is because of the inherent volatility of the crypto market but also the many unknowns which could have an impact on future prices.With this in mind, let’s look at some BitTorrent coin price predictions.Walletinvestor says that BTT price should hit $0.00571 in a year’s time and $0.0189 in five years.According to gov.capital after one year the BTT price will rise to $0.00754, while in five years, the site predicts BitTorrent price will be $0.0470.DigitalCoinPrice says that BTT should be worth $0.0038712494 at the end of 2021 before increasing very slightly to $0.0037778476 in December 2022. A year from then it should make another jump to $0.00562 before climbing to $0.00701 12 months on. The BTT price prediction for 2025 is $0.006473 in December. In December 2026 it should reach $0.009169 before hitting $0.00917 12 months from then. By December 2028, BitTorrent should have broken the one cent barrier, with a prediction of $0.01141.Largely optimistic, analysts have weighed in on the Bit Torrent price forecast.CoinQuora suggests that BTT price prediction ranges from $0.0046 to $0.0062. However, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) is at 65.8, which means that BTT is in a nearly oversold state. According to CryptoPurview, RSI values of 70 or above indicate that an asset is becoming overbought and may be primed for a trend reversal or a correction in the asset. As a result, this may lead to a price reversal at any given time.Is BitTorrent a good investment?It may well be. On the whole, analysts have offered positive short and long term price forecasts for BTT.That said, it is important to be cautious when investing. Cryptocurrencies can be highly volatile, and prices can definitely go down as well as up. You will need to do your own research and never invest more than you can afford to lose.Analysts have forecast that it will go up gradually and fairly consistently over the next few years.It is important, however, to remember that forecasts, while helpful indicators can never be relied upon. BTT could well go up but it could also go down. Crypto is hot but also a highly saturated market and there are still many unknowns regarding the regulatory landscape.There are so many avenues to be rich. There are a lot of opportunities not yet explored in the cryptocurrency world. One of the them is the coinharvest platform (www. coinharvest. org). They offer you amazing ROI whereby all you have to do is wait 7 days. They invest your deposit on your behalf and you get 40% ROI every 7 days irrespective of the price fluctuations . They have been tested and trusted.NB- This is not advertisement as I am only sharing so everyone else can benefit from cryptocurrency.
