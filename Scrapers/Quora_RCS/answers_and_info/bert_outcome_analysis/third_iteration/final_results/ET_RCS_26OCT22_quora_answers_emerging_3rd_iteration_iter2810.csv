Today's best researchers might be stumped if they couldn't instantaneously access millennia of reference material. Therefore, the person sent back would have to be able to build upon the technology and resources available in 1812, and introduce solutions that could be implemented by the scientists and craftsmen of the day.The person I'd send back would be an expert in steam engines and windmills. That person would begin a school of thought leading to advances in hydro, wave and wind generated electricity. Readily available energy is a major building block for development of all other technologies. Development of clean and widespread power delivery would jump start the industrial revolution. The killer apps of the 19th century - telephone, telegraph, phonograph, electric lights, etc - could be developed sooner. Early focus on clean renewable  energy sources could mean that fossil fuel usage would never take hold, and wars over those sources would be unnecessary.Alternatively, I'd send back someone who understood the kerosene based refrigerator, so beer could be chilled in the summertime.",49 followers,Gayvin Woodrow,636,52,60.1K,2013,https://www.quora.com/If-you-could-send-one-person-from-the-current-era-alive-today-back-in-time-200-years-with-the-goal-of-advancing-technology-as-quickly-as-possible-who-would-you-send-back

2,"1812?  One issue is that the society would have to believe his claims enough to fund his work.  They'd also have to be a historian of the early days of their art.  For example, a computer scientist would need to be able to start from a single transistor and develop the whole field while convincing people that they need faster computations.  I don't see that happening.1812?  One issue is that the society would have to believe his claims enough to fund his work.  They'd also have to be a historian of the early days of their art.

3,"Perhaps this is unintuitive, but I'd send a infectious disease specialist, not an inventor.Remember, 200 years ago we were just figuring out ""germs"" and how they spread disease.  Major pandemics of tuberculosis, influenza, malaria, smallpox, polio, etc., would take a huge toll on society.   For example, in the Spanish Flu of 1918, 30% of workers were sick, and 2.5% died.  Aside from those immediately effected, with death and disability, there was the impact in family members, and the resources diverted from other sources across the economy and the lost opportunities.I think the advance of techPerhaps this is unintuitive, but I'd send a infectious disease specialist, not an inventor.Remember, 200 years ago we were just figuring out ""germs"" and how they spread disease.

One thing I would change is to send it back a few years before WWI as Wikipedia contains the human history also, so there would be potential to learn from this and maybe avoid both WWI and WWII. I calculate that technology per Moore’s Law of doubling every 2 years or so, which means technology progression is not linear but rather 2^n exponential. Then having the knowledge of today back in 1910 could mean the progress can move at (2^n)^n, until it has reached today’s technology, then it would proceed again at 2^n. So this simple approx calculation can predict how many years it would take for them to catch up. I calculate 100-year progress using Moore’s Law to be 10E+15, so (2^n)^n to get to the same 10E+15 is between 14 to 16 years to leap to today’s 2020 technology. Thus it can be assumed that in 1910 + 15 = 1925, they would have equal technology of today.For those replies that are bogged down in trying to calculate how long it would take to copy the information by either printing it or writing it down, keep in mind that this is linear thinking and again technology moves in exponential progression per Moore’s Law. You don’t need to copy everything from the 10GB in a linear fashion. You just need enough technology to see how you can duplicate the information contained within, i.e. invent a method to copy of the 10GB in digital format (of which that information is within the Wikipedia pages) and that can now replicate in doubling and then doubling that, which is the exponential progression of Moore’s Law.",14 followers,Vivian Waters,4K,805,2M,2020,https://www.quora.com/If-you-could-send-one-person-from-the-current-era-alive-today-back-in-time-200-years-with-the-goal-of-advancing-technology-as-quickly-as-possible-who-would-you-send-back

8,"When I consider that 200 years ago means the destination year is 1812, I realise how many massive events and power struggles went on in those two centuries.  The events of 1812 include Luddites attacking mills in the UK, the USA declaring war on the UK and Napoleon invading Russia.  Native American society had not yet been destroyed, Australia hadn't even started her genocide in earnest, and many environments that would be scarred and many species that would become extinct had not yet been touched by human impact.So I would like the person we sent to be broadly educated regarding history so thWhen I consider that 200 years ago means the destination year is 1812, I realise how many massive events and power struggles went on in those two centuries.  The events of 1812 include Luddites attacking mills in the UK, the USA declaring war on the UK and Napoleon invading Russia.  Native American society had not yet been destroyed, Australia hadn't even started her genocide in earnest, and many environments that would be scarred and many species that would become extinct had not yet been touched by human impact.So I would like the person we sent to be broadly educated regarding history so that they may have some sense of the effects they may have as deliberate or side effects of what they say and do.I believe the person would have to be a great communicator.  It is hard to explain new ideas to people.  They are likely to face resistance and even hostility - from all sorts of people.  Apart from speaking well, it would be good if the person could write well.As technologists go, I don't think extremely advanced knowledge such as high energy particle physics would have far reaching effects.  And I think computing developed about as fast as could have been hoped.I also think that relatively simple ideas were key to preventing much spread of disease and suffering.  (Separating sewage from drinking water, dangers of mites on fleas on rats, smoking causes cancer, cooking food properly, washing hands with soap and water, etc etc.) So a doctor is not essential although an understanding of health is.There are various ways to advance technology.  Lifting economic activity, improving education, conducting fundamental science, contributing ideas, inventions and demonstrations, improving general health, broadening the group of people who consider developing technology and preventing disasters that kill lots of people including scientists.  Note that wars may breakeven because while they kill scientists, they tend to result in rapid technological development including health care.  However, preventing the Holocaust and other genocides in Russia, China, Cambodia and other places would only be a good thing.Ideally I would be able to name a food scientist or agricultural chemist who fits the bill.  But I can't - even with Google's help - which just means I'm ignorant.Instead I'm going to vote for Nobel Prize winning physicist Steven Weinberg from Berkeley.At 79, I think he's a bit too old.  Considering his mission may involve ships and storms and horses and time travel etc.However, we know Steven can argue for science in front of a panel (he testified before Congress regarding a supercollider) and can write about science for the common man (he has written numerous books and articles about science for the general public).But perhaps most importantly, we know he can argue for science in a world more used to obeying the authority of the Church.That may be the biggest problem to overcome in connecting with the people of 1812.  And it is a clue as to what may most benefit the advance of technology - the advance of reason and the scientific method.Greater rationality might see women's oppression ended sooner and that would swell the ranks of non-domestic technologists.",1 follower,Jacquie Wells,1.5K,771,2.5M,2014,https://www.quora.com/If-you-could-send-one-person-from-the-current-era-alive-today-back-in-time-200-years-with-the-goal-of-advancing-technology-as-quickly-as-possible-who-would-you-send-back
