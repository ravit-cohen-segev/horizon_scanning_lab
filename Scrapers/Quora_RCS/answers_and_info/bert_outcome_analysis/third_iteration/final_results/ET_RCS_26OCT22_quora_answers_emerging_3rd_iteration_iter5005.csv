3,"Travel back in time. Some people think because we can imagine doing it , sooner or later, it will be possible. I don’t believe that. Entropy moves in one direction only. ( Order to Disorder) For example, if you were to open a bottle of perfume in a closed room, returned after an hour, the molecules in the perfume bottle would have defused throughout the room. Conversely, if you were to enter a room that reeked of that same perfume, placed an empty bottle on the table and walked away for an hour, what would be the chances of all the perfume molecules now being in the bottle?","3,411 followers",Louis Vaught,4.8K,1.2K,13.5M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-things-that-digital-technology-can-never-replace

It makes people happy, it can't be replicated for free, and it makes the world a prettier place.4.Technology can't replace the clothes we are wearing, the food we eat, etc. The basic things related to life can't be replaced by technology although they can be modified a bit. For example, most of the clothes we wear are machine made whereas earlier (before technological) development they were hand made. Our feelings can't be replaced by technology. No matter how much advancement happens in technology, our moms will always be worried if we ate properly or not. Technology is just a way of making life more luxurious, it can add many things in our life but can't replace much.And you know….Some Things Are Just Better in Person.So at last I would like to say…..“Technology already has replaced analog clocks.

The iPhone’s A13 CPU is faster than the Galaxy 10’s Snapdragon 855 Plus. The iPhone has 4 GB of RAM versus the Galaxy’s 8 GB of RAM — but iOS demands about half the RAM that Android does, so it’s a wash.

15,"There was an Age of Radio addiction. It swallowed everyone, and led to the relative decline of live theater, or even live story telling amongst families or groups. This was supplanted by the Age of TV addiction. People stopped sitting around the radio for evening family technological entertainment. The Boob Tube reigned. Next, comes the Age of Social Media. No longer is this generation glued to the TV, but rather to Instagram, Facebook, people walking off cliffs while searching for pokieman, Youtube, live streaming, etc.Technology marches forward as it always has.

No longer is this generation glued to the TV, but rather to Instagram, Facebook, people walking off cliffs while searching for pokieman, Youtube, live streaming, etc.Technology marches forward as it always has. I don’t think it’s foolish to think that something else will follow; something possibly currently un-imagined. What will take the place of social media with everyone’s nose and face in their smart phones? I don’t believe this is the end-all to what kind of technology will take over as the next addiction. Surely it will be something different, and Social Media will suffer the same fate as TV, Radio, and theater before it. Something is next. Something different… where millennials in their 80’s will laugh about having a smart phone glued to their palms during their youth, and future young people will roll their eyes at such old-fashioned foolish reminiscing by their elders.Something will be next. But what? I believe Social Media will run its course and be replaced. Perhaps holograms will play a large part.Conversing with, visiting with Kim in Korea, or Staszu in Poland, sitting in the chair next to you but only in hologram form.Perhaps even intimacy through 3D. Pulling up T-Rex to spend the day with, like the holodeck on Star Trek. I feel the next addiction will allow us to more fully immerse ourselves into the technology; not simply look at/listen to it… but to BE it. Not so much “communication” per se, but rather personal experience. We’ll be able to look within more precisely… more targeted, rather than a bombardment of everything that’s available all at once. More personalized and customized for “us”, instead of wading through everything and everyone all at once. Endless possibilities of what will be our next technology addiction, that will consume all our time, while smart phones gather dust in the Smithsonian.The",12 followers,Tito Adaggio,987,0,0,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-things-that-digital-technology-can-never-replace

The thing is, different cultures are going to integrate with technology differently. There is no one size fits all future trend, there never has been.

What about the age of Radio addiction. Many of these same critiques were lobbied by ‘experts’ in their own time. Were we better off before mass media? It’s hard to answer that one objectively.Sure, we have a lot of screen time, but what makes you think that will necessarily stop? Aren’t on on your screen reading that now? Does screen time always have to be bad? Technology doesn’t have to be isolating.Besides, in many ways, we already are integrating with technology.I for one have been waiting for robot legs.Joking aside, we are at an interesting crossroads with technology. I think it is foolish to assume which way this is going to go. The most likely avenue is that it will become ever more integrated into our lives. In fact our grandchildren may look back at us as primitives in their fully integrated immortal and disease free, bio organic bodies. Who knows!?
