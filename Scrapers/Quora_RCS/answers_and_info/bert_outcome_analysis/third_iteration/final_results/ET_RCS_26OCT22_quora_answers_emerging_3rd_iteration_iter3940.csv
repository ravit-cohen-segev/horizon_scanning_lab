An officer in the British Army, Lt. Col. Martin of Agar Malva, was leading the army in the war against Afghanistan.Col. Martin would regularly send messages of his well-being to his wife. The war went on for a long period of time and Lady Martin stopped getting his messages. This naturally worried her.One day, while riding on her horse, she passed by the temple of Baijnath Mahadev. The sounds of the conch and mantras attracted her. She went inside the temple and came to know that the Brahmans were worshipping Lord Shiva.The Brahmans saw her and noticed that she was sad and tense. They asked what the matter was and she explained everything to them. They told her that Lord Shiva listens to the prayers of devotees and takes them out of difficult situations.On the advice of the Brahmans, she started the ‘Laghu-rudri Anushtthan’ of the Mantra: ‘Om Namah Shivaya’, for 11 days. She prayed to Lord Shiva that if her husband reaches home safely, then she would get the temple renovated.On the last of the ‘Laghu-rudri’, a messenger came and gave her a letter. It was from her husband. He had written – “I was regularly sending messages to you from the battle grounds, but suddenly the Pathans surrounded us from all sides.

He isn't bound to her, neither falls for her, nor chases her.However, as Mahadeva, he has to be made to mingle (participate) in the outside world. He has to be transformed from Shiva (the hermit) to Shankara (the householder). That's when Maya takes her original form. She transcends to Adi Shakti. Shakti then channels through the material world to become Sati, the daughter of Prajapati Daksha.As Sati, she makes Shiva to participate in the world. She triggers his emotions, churns his Tapas (which he has developed through meditation from time immemorial), and makes him Shankara. She explains him about Love and introduces him to hate. She then teaches him about pain. She jumps in the sacrificial fire and destroys her mortal body. That's when he changes from Shiva to Rudra. His Tapas emerges in the form of heat. He is experienced by the outside world, and that's what God is for.The Shakti then is born as Parvati. Earlier she explained him about Love, now she experiences him Love. Shiva is Kamantaka, the destroyer of desires, so she becomes Kamakshi, the one with the eyes full of desire. As Kamakshi she transforms Kamantaka to Kameshwara, the Lord of desire. When Shiva, as Rudra destroys the head of his son, she transforms him into Shankara, saturating his Ugra roop (violent form) to Sheetal roop (calm form). As Shankara, he bolts life back into his son.As Shiva develops his tapas, he not only conseals the energy inside him, but also absorbs it from the outside world. He traps Shakti inside him. As a result, the energy absorbed inside him, makes the world outside him cold and barren. It becomes Kailash, trapped in snow cladded mountains with no sign of vegetation. Shakti then takes the form of Ganga. As Ganga she takes his tapas to the outside world. She flows from the melting of glaciers, indicating the utilisation of tapas.The world requires Shiva and hence Shakti makes him participate in it. Shiva becomes Shankara, the householder for the entire world.

Deaths of adharmis proved it.1. Deaths of atheists and adharmis proved it. Mount Kailash is a Mountain That Cannot Be Climbed by Anyone and Should never be attempted to do so ! Russians did deep research on Mount Kailash (originally spelt as कैलाश पर्वत), abode of Bhawan Shiv, and proved that the mountain is indeed axis and nodal point of this world.2. One of the ideas the Russians have put forward is that Mt. Kailas could be a vast, human-built pyramid, the centre of an entire complex of smaller pyramids, a hundred in total. This complex, moreover, might be the centre of a world–wide system connecting other monuments or sites where mysteries and unexplained phenomena have been observed. The idea of the pyramid in this region is not new. It goes back to the timeless Sanskrit epic of the Ramayana.3. Sita Mata was abducted by Lankan King Raavan, no one knew where Sita Maa was kept so a huge search exercise was planned with the Sugreev and Vanar Sena (team of chosen beings, monkeys, who were intellectually, physically and mentally far superior from humans of that time, they took rebirth to be a part of leela for avatar of Bhagwan Vishnu to annihilate adharmis/anti-Vedic beings) . The exercise also helped Vanars gain new knowledge about various places in Bharat. The search begins and three mountain peaks of the Himalayas are mentioned, the Kala, Sudarshana and the Devasakha. Across these peaks, Sugreev informs the Vanars, is a vast expanse of barren plain land, crossing which they shall see Mount Kailash.4. The Locations of Celestial Mounts Given in Ramayan are Accurate According to Ramayan, the vast expanse of land are the plains of Tibet, and the location of Mount Kailash is geographically correct. There are two ‘Kailash’ peaks in Tibet in today’s maps, but a quick search on Google Maps by looking up ‘Kailash, Burang, Ngari, China’, will pop up the right Mount Kailash. Those who are familiar with Mt. Kailash will recognize the peak and will be able to identify the grooves which are cut horizontally across (popularly referred to as the ‘jata’ of Bhagwan Shiv). An oblong reservoir (or the ‘yoni’) just below the peak, and Lake Mansarover (Mapam Yumco) down at level ground below are also easily identifiable. A look on the zoomed satellite image of the Mt, Kailash at Ngari, Tibet will revel some unique well known features of Mt. Kailash.5. Sugreeva then mentions the mansion of Kubera built on Mt. Kailasha constructed by the celestial architect Vishwakarma. Sugreev instructs the ‘vanaras’ to move ahead. He gives them three more mountain peak landmarks. He mentions Mount Krauncha with a highly impassable tunnel. Like Shiva bought down the Ganges on to Bharat Varsha (earth) from the heavens (Himalayas), his son or his ‘junior’ Skanda is credited with having chiseled a tunnel through Mt. Krauncha. One of the best known ancient tunnels in China is the Guolinag Tunnel in the Taihang Mountains. Up until 1972 only an ancient path chiseled through the rocks of this mountain linked the villages in the area to the outside world. Here is an image of the ancient path of Guolinag which was improved in 1972, not by the government, but once again by the locals. It took them five years to complete the task.6. The Mount Krauncha reference given in Ramayan is one of the peaks in the Taihang Range which indicates that the tunnel is very ancient. The path is clearly mentioned in Ramayan: From Kailash (in the Himalayas) to Krauncha (in the Taihang Range), there are many other mountain peaks – namely the ‘treeless’ Mt. Kaama and the ‘abode of birds’, Mt. Maanasa, – that the ‘vanaras’ will see. The history in Ramayan is referring to these two as Tuanjie as Kaama and Taibai as Maanasa. Sugreev instructs Vanars to scour all these mountains thoroughly in search for Sita Mata. These are the mountains of the Qinling Range which falls between the Himalayas and the Taihang Mountains as the ‘vanaras’ move in the north-east direction from Kailash. The two highest peaks, and therefore most visible, in this chain are the Tuanjie and the Taibai.7. Big Pyramids Created by Celestial Beings Matches History of Ramayan7. Then Sugreev mentions another peak called Mt. Mainaaka, which is identified by ‘a massive mansion built by demon architect by the name Maya’. Just as the ‘Ram-Setu’ of Ramayan (oldest bridge ever known to mankind) lies exactly in the spot mentioned in the Ramayana, and the Gympie Pyramid of Queensland (Australia) referred in Ramayan as ‘a peak like structure built by the celestial architect Vishwakarma’, Similarly, the ‘Mansion of Maya’ is also located on the same place as referred in China, it is another pre-historical megalithic structure built by ‘celestial beings’ of Ramayan. The maximum number of ancient pyramids of China, whose existence until recently was completely denied, lie in the Shaanxi Province. The chinese govt tried hard to hide these facts but when they failed to decipher their existence, Vedic structure and purpose, they admitted them to be very ancient. The largest one of them, the Xi’an is only 184 Km from the Taibai peak, well on the path of the ‘Vanaras’ mentioned in the Ramayana.8. In the entire Himalayan range, from the parts of Bharat (India) to Tibet and parts of China, there lies range of ancient Pyramids (like Mt. Mainakaa is in Shaanxi province). These huge mountain peaks or pyramids are protected by mother of all peaks – Mount Kailash, an abode of Bhagwan Shiv.9. Details of Ramayan Proved Correct About Spirituality of Himalayan Range9. Sugreev informs Vanars that the next landmark, after crossing over a vast province, would be a large lake by the name ‘Vaikhana”. Travelling North of China, crossing the Mongolian province or plateau, one would arrive at the eastern tip of Lake Baikal in Siberia. Its should be noted that ‘Vaikhana’ is also known as ‘Baikaal’ lake of Siberia. Sugreev further added that the other (Western) end of Lake Vaikhana, is a river by the name Shailoda, and if the ‘vanaras’ were to follow its path northward, across many miles ‘they would reach the Northern Ocean’. This is indeed true. Shailoda has been identified as the present day Angara. River ‘Angara’ flows from the western tip of lake Baikaal and after many miles falls into the Kara Sea of North Arctic Ocean.10. The name Kara has a Sanskrit origin which means tribute or ray of a celestial body. Ancient Indian texts refer to Siberia as Uttara-Kuru. ‘Uttara’ means ‘North’, ‘Kuru’ is the name of the Indian tribe that had traveled north. ‘Kara’, the name of the Sea into which the Angara River falls, is also known to be a distorted form of the ancient Sanskrit name ‘Kuru’. It is also said that ‘Kara’ Sea gets its name from the ‘Kara’ river which falls into it. ‘Kara’ here therefore also refer to the Sanskrit ‘krishna’ (कृष्ण) or ‘kala’ (काल) meaning ‘black. Bamboo Boats were invented by Vanars of Ramayan11. Sugreev instructs the ‘vanaaras’ to cross Lake Baikaal with the help of the ‘keechaka’ (Bamboo) that grows there. This has reference to the ‘Siberian Bamboo Grass’ which was used by the locals to cross the lakes in this region. Sugreev also tells Vanars that northern lights will become visible as they move northwards from Lake Vaikhana.12. There is very beautiful description, In Section 43, Verse 36 of Kishkinda Kand, Valmiki says, “Going beyond that expanse of water, you will come upon a sky, which even when devoid of the stars or the moon or the sun is illuminated by rays, as if there is light emitting from the self-luminous, god-like sages who repose there”. The lights which Sage Valmiki is referring to, is seen since thousands of years which only recently is known as ‘Aurora Borealis’. The scientist community has conflicting views on how it occurs but its answer lies in historical Ramayan.13. The last landmark mentioned in Uttara-Kuru is Mt. Soma. Mt. Soma has to be one of the peaks of the Urals. The highest peak in the Urals is the ‘Narodnaya’ – which in the local language means ‘Mountain of the People’. In Sanskrit too the word has the same meaning- ‘nara’ means ‘people’ or ‘human’ and ‘udaya’ means ‘elevation’.14. Many rivers and mountains of Siberia have Sanskrit names, including Mt. Mana-Raga, River Kama, Lake Kulind and many many more, proving beyond doubt that Sages once traveled these places to meditate peacefully. Russians claim that all the mountains shaped in pyramid forms are actually built by super natural humans who were technologically advanced again seconding the details given in Ramayan that celestial beings did built these places.15. Axis Mundi or Center of Earth Is The Axis That Make Earth Revolve15. Mysteries of Kailash Mansarovar are not mysteries for Devotees of Bhagwan Shiv Shankar Secrets…Enigma…Mysteries That Russians Claimed to Have Solved Before dwelling into details of Russian scientists let us see what Vedas say. According to Vedas, there was definite purpose for each creation across the globe; mountains, trees, hills, lake, rivers, Ganges; each of these divinely elements were bought or created by Vedic Gods for some purpose. The reason for the creation of Mountains and Hills by Vedic Gods is give here:16. The Purpose of Axis and How It Controls the Seasons, Days and Nights and Weather of the World16. The Purpose of Axis and How It Controls the Seasons, Days and Nights and Weather of the World. The Axis Mundi, the centre of the universe, the navel of the world, the world pillar, Kang Tisé or Kang Rinpoche (the ‘Precious Jewel of Snow’ in Tibetan), Meru (or Sumeru), Swastika Mountain, Mt. Astapada, Mt. Kangrinboge (the Chinese name) – all these names, belong to one of the most holiest and mysterious mountains in the world – Mount Kailash (कैलाश पर्वत).17. Both geography and history play roles in the sacred significance of Mount Kailash. This holy mountain rises to an altitude of 6666 meters. It is called mother of all mountains though in terms of peaks in the nearby Himalayan range, which includes Mount Everest, its grandeur lies not in height but in its distinct shape – four sheer faces marking the cardinal points of the compass – and its solitary location, free of neighboring mountains that might dwarf or obscure it. Mount Kailash (कैलाश पर्वत) is regarded as the earthly and eternal manifestation of the Hindus’ Mount Meru, or Sumeru, the spiritual center of the universe, the axis mundi in Buddhist and Jain as well as Hindu cosmology.18. The area around this great mountain is the source of four life-giving rivers; the Indus, Brahmaputra, Surlej and Karnali, which is a major tributary of India’s sacred Ganges, begin here. To further enhance the symbolic authority of the mountain as a sacred place, two lakes are situated at the base of the mountain. The higher lake Manasarovar (one of the highest freshwater lakes in the world), is the sacred lake, and is round like the sun. The lower lake Rakshas Tal (one of the highest salt-water lakes) is the devil’s lake and has the shape of the crescent moon. The two lakes represent solar and lunar forces, good and negative energies respectively. Lake Manasarovar remains calm irrespective of the weather conditions whereas Rakshas Tal stays constantly stormy.19. The most ancient scriptures of the world; Vedas, Purans, Shiv Puran and other Upnishads clearly inform to the human race that Mount Kailash (कैलाश पर्वत) is abode of Lord Shiva. To Tibetan Buddhists, who devised their own religion following Buddha, a Vedic Hindu by birth, Kailash is the abode of the tantric meditational deity Demchog. Hindus see Kailash as the throne of the great god Shiva, being ancient faith, this is considered more authoritative than other religions. Jains who follow Jainism which emerged from Hinduism, also revere Kailash, for them, one of their most significant deities received enlightenment here. Buddhist, Hindu and Jain pilgrims from the world over go to this holy mountain to circumambulate.20. Climbing Mount Kailas is forbidden (Tibetan monks claims that the only person to have ever been atop the sacred mountain is Milarepa, a 11th century Tibetan Buddhist Yogi). Here it can be seen that all religions that emerged from Hinduism are following ritual and rites of respecting same mountains and hills that Hindus revere as Vedic entities created by Gods.21. It is a popular belief that the stairways on Mount Kailash lead to heaven. History of holy places around Mount Kailash range were spread throughout many centuries, has attracted millions of Hindu devotees, other religious people and also became of interest to philosophers, adventurers, theologists scetist and even… political leaders! It received many names: Shambhala, Shangri-La, etc.22. Mt. Kailash is as mysteric as its size. A great mass of rock soaring to over 22,000 feet, Mt. Kailash has the unique distinction of being the world’s most venerated holy place at the same time that it is the least visited. The supremely sacred site of Hindu dharma and 3 other religions and billions of people, Kailash is seen by no more than a few thousand pilgrims each year. This curious fact is explained by the mountain’s remote location in far western Tibet. No planes, trains or buses journey anywhere near the region and even with rugged over-land vehicles the journey still requires weeks of difficult, often dangerous travel. The weather, always cold, can be unexpectedly treacherous and pilgrims must carry all the supplies they will need for the entire journey.23. The landscape around the mountain is rugged and dry but crossed by crystalline blue streams and other bodies of water. Near the sacred mountain is the source of the Indus, Sutlej and Bramaputra rivers and on its south side are two freshwater lakes, the easternmost of which is the highly sacred Lake Manasarowar (Mapam). With an altitude of 14,950 feet, Mansarovar is the highest body of fresh water in the world. The other lake, Rakshastal, also has legendary significance. According to Vedic Hindu texts, Shiva, the god of destruction and regeneration, resides at the summit of a legendary mountain named Kailasa.24.Mount Kailasa is regarded in many sects of Hinduism as Paradise, the ultimate destination of souls and the spiritual center of the world. According to a beautiful description in the Puranas, Mount Kailash’s four faces are made of crystal, ruby, gold, and lapis lazuli; it is the pillar of the world; rises 84,000 leagues high; is the center of the world mandala; and is located at the heart of six mountain ranges symbolizing a lotus. From it flow four rivers, which stretch to the four quarters of the world and divide the world into four regions.25. Kailash is sacred to other religions which emerged from Vedic dharma, Hinduism. The Jains call the mountain Astapada and believe it to be the place where Rishaba, the first of the twenty-four Tirthankaras attained liberation. Followers of Bon, Tibet’s pre-Buddhist, shamanistic religion, call the mountain Tise and believe it to be the seat of the Sky Goddess Sipaimen. Additionally, Bon myths regard Tise as the sight of a legendary 12th century battle of sorcery between the Buddhist sage Milarepa and the Bon shaman Naro Bon-chung. Milarepa’s defeat of the shaman displaced Bon as the primary religion of Tibet, firmly establishing Buddhism in its place.26. While the Buddha is believed to have magically visited Kailash in the 5th century BC, the religion of Buddhism only entered Tibet, via Nepal and India, in the 7th century AD. Tibetan Buddhists call the mountain Kang Rimpoche, the ‘Precious One of Glacial Snow’, and regard it as the dwelling place of Demchog (also known as Chakrasamvara) and his consort, Dorje Phagmo. Three hills rising near Kang Rimpoche are believed to be the homes of the the Bodhisatvas Manjushri, Vajrapani, and Avalokiteshvara.27. Pilgrims to Kailash, after the difficult journey getting there, are then confronted with the equally arduous task of circumambulating the sacred peak. This walking around the mountain (clockwise for the Buddhists, counter-clockwise for Bon adherents) is known as a Kora, or Parikrama, and normally takes three days. In hopes of gaining extra merit or psychic powers however, some pilgrims will vary the tempo of their movement. A hardy few, practicing a secret breathing technique known as Lung-gom, will power themselves around the mountain in only one day.28. Others will take two to three weeks for the Kora by making full body prostrations the entire way. It is believed that a pilgrim who completes 108 journeys around the mountain is assured enlightenment. Most pilgrims to Kailash will also take a short plunge in the nearby, highly sacred (and very cold) Lake Manosaravar. The word ‘manas’ means mind or consciousness; the name Manosaravar means Lake of Consciousness and Enlightenment. Adjacent to Manosaravar is Rakas Tal or Rakshas, the Lake of Demons. Pilgrimage to this great sacred mountain and these two magical lakes is a life changing experience and an opportunity to view some of the most magical scenery on the entire planet.29. No pilgrims climb Mt. Kailash; all four religions believe it would be a serious act of sacrilege to set foot on its slopes. Legend has it that the only person to have reached the summit is the Buddhist champion Milarepa (who flew to the top in the 11th century) and that all others who have ventured to defy the warning have died in the process. The mountain is located in a particularly remote and inhospitable area of the Tibetan Himalayas. Only those in the best health are able to undertake the journey even to the starting point of the circumambulation, let alone walk 52 km in a single day. A few modern amenities, such as benches, resting places and refreshment kiosks, exist to aid the pilgrims in their devotions.",UNKNOWN,Aham Jogi,20.9K,131,7.8M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Once-computers-reach-their-peak-advancement-what-will-be-the-next-main-technology-that-rapidly-advances-the-same-way-computers-did

How this was possible with just an act of Fiction and imaginary myths. The lake described Mansarobar , the lake of life and its mirror lake , Mrit lake , the lake of death. Both located in the proximity of Mount Kailash with hardly km of land dividing them has the biggest mystery. One is fresh water lake, which is circular representing SUN and other being the salt water crescentic shaped lake representing the MOON. (the Good and Devil, Life and Death ). Hardly a miracle.As I quoted earlier , Mount Kailash being gifted to Lord Shiva By King Himalayan, Mount Kailash is now discussed as biggestMount Kailash is sacred not only in ONE religion but FOURHow could some myth of one religion be equally and highly valued in other religions too ? Lord Shiva is regarded as the ADIYOGI, the greatest YOGI in universal acceptable term.( He is the supreme of God in HINDUISM and one of the THREE deity . IF this ADIYOGI term can be accepted , then it can be said with certainty that he was supreme of that time and had influential power over the region . This way he could have influenced the followers of other religions or later those followers developed different religions. This too proves Mount Kailash is spiritual and the existence of Lord Shiva .Now to the questions why Mount Kailash is unscalableI would like to quote few paragraphs from previous reply about Mount Kailash under same questionAnd I respect what he said .Mountaineer“If we conquer this mountain, then we conquer something in people’s souls.”Edit 1. Thanks for the suggestion and grammatical correction. I appreciated with my heart.Edit 2. I worte it as I was knowing something new about Mount Kailash for the first time and needed to know more .

Surface treatment processes, working a piece of metal with a hammer in a charcoal fire, got modest amounts of carbon into the face of iron pieces, technically producing very thin layers of steel which gave them nice hard edges, but the Romans lacked the technology to produce homogeneous steel [1].As it happens, a number of Asian societies developed steel-making techniques early in the Middle Ages. High-quality Chinese furnaces could develop temperatures high enough to make cast iron, from which carbon could be “cooked out” to turn it into more malleable steel. And other societies developed crucible techniques combining ground ore and charcoal which produced ingots of steel.
