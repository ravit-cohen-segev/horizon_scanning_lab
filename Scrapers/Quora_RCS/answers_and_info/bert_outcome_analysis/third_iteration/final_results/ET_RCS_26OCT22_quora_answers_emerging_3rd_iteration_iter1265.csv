Technology revolutionizes our daily lives and there are several technology trends that will help you in the years to come, and which should be known. So let's find out exactly what Technology Trends related to this technology that will improve standard of communication and improve on standard of living in Cities and daily lives brought on from enhanced research and development and education with 5G and related technology;1. Artificial IntelligenceAI is about all intelligent machines that will artificially act like talking, reading, watching, recognizing things and emotions like humans. Using algorithms and code, the machine can perform tasks that are very burdensome for us. And that too with accuracy and efficiency. AI began to be used well everywhere from health services to banking. It can be used on gadgets too. Various voice assistants such as Google Assistant are operated by Artificial Intelligence (AI).Today, many researchers and companies will work in this region to really help us in our daily lives. AI has created possibilities in specific ways , in areas as AI in health services .2. Machine Learning, Robotic and mechatronic applicationTrends in Machine Learning technologyAnother interesting and emerging technology is machine learning. This is an integral part of AI, which can be a machine's ability to understand, analyze, and track itself. In other words, placing skills to be understood in machines or computers is Machine Learning, which offers the ability to know data. That's possible through algorithms.The possibility of hand held device might come out with diagnostic models due to fast data processing allowing AI to be integrated in such areas will see faster and even accurate option of better healthcare or even or in most areas of application that requires computing solution that can be provide thru high speed data acquisition and computation allowing for better developed software to make use dedicated equipment able to acquire data acquisition to enable higher response rate and data processing( available on googleplay and Amazon kindle - AppleIbook - Dwayne Anderson )3. IoTInternet of Things technology trendsIoT is one of the fastest growing technologies in recent years. ""Internet of Things"" is just a concept or concept through which all smart devices can connect to each other using the internet.The Internet of Things is a network that uses applications, electronics, and the internet to really help connect devices, gadgets, or equipment to each other. Once they are connected, they can communicate and exchange information. Radio frequency identification (RFID), sensors, wireless, and QR codes are IoT applications. Similarly, AI and Machine Learning will also be connected with thinking about the Internet.If you are aware of Smart Homes and Home Automation, IoT is the main idea behind the device and the type of equipment that makes your home Smart.Smarter cities will then include integration of smarter facilities and also smart homes into a smart digital hub for everybody to live , work and play4. Augmented RealityAR is increasingly being applied today. Already used in various activities including art, entertainment, trade, education and the army. And also available on your own smart device. Augmented Reality (AR) improves user experience with sound overlays, videos, graphics, etc. On the real things. Unlike VR, AR develops the facts by enveloping digital elements on it which could act as interactive sensor that allow data manipulation and communicationThe Augmented Reality application is growing rapidly. It is important to realize that it has an extraordinary ability to change our perception of humans.AR is also used in industries such as health, public safety, tourism and many other industries5. 5G Technology5G is the next generation mobile network technology that will provide much faster speed than today's 4G LTE network .there are 2 major manufacturer namely Nokia and Huawei both working and competing for '5G First'. Similarly, phone manufacturers focus on devices prepared for 5G. However, 5G technology may be commercially available in 2020, but has Huawei has push and started launching in China and in the UK when recently USA started tariff related trade war with CHINA , and was try to put up technological restraint especially on HuaweiWorld Gone mobile with 5 G mobile for SmartphoneThe trend of mobile technology in 2019 is much more excited than the previous year. However, in 2018 many new concepts and things related to the latest mobile technology emerged. We started talking about 5G technology and eSIM. Similarly, some phones come with a wave of multiple cameras on the back, front unlocking and top-notch screen on the smartphone.Yes, it is true that the 5G wave has spread in the smartphone market. In addition, network companies have begun to think about the release of 5G. Although it will take more time, it may be up to 2020, but the focus of phone manufacturers is on this. And the next phones can be released this year with 5G compatibility. One of Samsung's main mobile phones has announced its 5G phone model: Galaxy S10 5G.Not all, but some of us can enjoy 5G speed smartphones. The reason behind this limitation is the execution of 5G. It seems that in 2019, 5G can only be implemented in some states of the world.",18 followers,Asim Qureshi,1K,996,155.9M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Can-you-imagine-how-will-technology-take-over-in-the-next-5-years

The state of global interest rates and their impact on fixed income asset valuations across the world.Today’s developed economy interest rate environment is truly unprecedented in the history of mankind. The role of central banks and their ability to continue to force cheap credit on the world’s economies is a big question mark for which we have very little precedent or economic history to draw upon for wisdom. Recently we have seen what looks to be a possible inflection point in US rates as they have marched steadily higher over the past several months, but the question remains how much room there actually is for domestic rates to run with a ECB President determined to continue his aggressive easing campaign in Europe. When you have a large player in the market that has the mandate of making economically impactful (but not necessarily rational) purchasing decisions, it can mean a lot of controversy and uncertainty around the future of global capital markets. Only time will tell how this plays out, but in the meantime it is a focus of debate for many macroeconomists.2. The deleveraging of China and how adroitly it can right its balance sheet without sparking a credit crisis.Over the last 20 years China has taken on a truly massive amount of debt to finance its industrial expansion. This expansion has been both impressive and remarkable in its duration, but now that economic growth is showing very real signs of slowing, Beijing is left with the serious issue of figuring out to deleverage the economy without precipitating a credit crisis the likes of which would even dwarf the one we saw in the United States during the Great Recession. There are several ways in which Beijing can steer the economy towards a recapitalization that ends smoothly and without fuss (including debt-for-equity swaps, monetary devaluation, etc.), but the window is shrinking and the margin for error getting dangerously slim. Globalization has been a tremendous asset to the Chinese economy, but the other side of the coin is that having foreign creditors constitute such a large fraction of the capital stack means that Beijing can no longer enact monetary and fiscal policy as unilaterally as it has in the past. The skillfulness with which Beijing reduces the indebtedness of the Chinese economy over the next several years could mean the difference between the rise of a new economic superpower and a credit crisis the likes of which have never previously seen.3. The price of oil and natural gas, and whether the United States will truly grow into the role of the marginal supplier of these commodities over the next few years.The shale revolution in the United States has made it one of the largest and most important players in the global energy markets over the last decade. Notably, the relative nimbleness with which the US can dial up and scale back production has made it a likely candidate for the next supplier of the marginal barrel of oil, a role that has historically been filled by OPEC. This is important because, unlike OPEC, which is composed entirely of national oil companies (NOCs), US producers are largely independent companies that answer to public shareholders. The difference is that whereas before the global price of oil could effectively be controlled by the production decisions of a handful of Middle Eastern governments, we may be entering an era in which the price of oil will be largely governed by supply and demand (OPEC may still influence near-term prices by setting higher or lower quotas, but the effects would only be short-lived). Additionally, the US has started to make real headway towards building out the necessary infrastructure to pipe, liquefy, and export its enormous natural gas reserves, which has enormous implications for the price of the commodity globally. All signs seem to point to the US as being on the verge of becoming a global energy powerhouse (pun intended), but a lot of this is still purely theoretical until we see it unfold.4. The extent to which Trump can push his proposed policies through Congress, and the ultimate impact of the US’s move towards corporate populism on global markets.While there is still a lot of uncertainty around the practical viability of some or all of his proposed policy reforms, directionally the themes seem very clear:","75,027 followers",Neman Ashraf,4.5K,410,37M,2017,https://www.quora.com/Can-you-imagine-how-will-technology-take-over-in-the-next-5-years

And yet, it’s a phone that flips open to separate the speaker from the microphone that gets the glory, notBut the flip cell phoneBut OP was asking about impossible tech.That's easy: Transporters. At least the way they're treksplained.Problem 1: Converting matter to energy. Yes, Einstein’s “Energy equals mass times the speed of light squared” holds true whether you are talking H-bombs or sunlight. Matter can be converted to energy. But while we're on the subject of H-bombs, let’s consider just how much energy converting 70 kilos of any mass is released to the mass converted in a hydrogen bomb. Such a process would be required to convert, channel and transmit the equivalent energy that would be generated by setting off about 30 Tsar Bomba H-bombs, each releasing the equivalent of 50,000,000 tons of TNT. Then, after that energy is converted, it has to be held itProblem 2: Data storage. No not the android from TNG, the information of a transported person’s pattern. According to the treksplanation, every particle gets mapped in this pattern. So let's start off with generous assumptions. Let's suppose the future has the ability to store all the information required to transportBut let’s trim back on the generosity now.
