But so will a solar flair - how many can accept that we are close to be sent back to the Stone Age because of our dependency no only on local computers but on the cloud-infrastructure?Even today, water-based infrastructures make up a huge part of the backbone of societies. The Roman empire showed what building of roads will do. Technology now allows for land-based infrastructure, a 2nd step in train-technologies. Think the silk road project. This may well be a game changer as space technology was.Lastly: Energy. There is nothing that can replace oil presently, also a limitation. As it stands, only nuclear can raise the bar but hardly with how we used it; in many aspects “idiotic.” Surely cannot go any further in space exploration with the current fuels.",18 followers,Asim Qureshi,1K,996,156M,2018,https://www.quora.com/How-much-technological-and-scientific-change-will-we-witness-in-the-next-decade

And that’s no exaggeration, viable quantum computers will literally be millions of times more potent at certain vital tasks.Quantum computing is not ready yet — it’s still in its infancy — but very serious progress is being now made. It’s advancing fast.At the same time, thousands more researchers are already making dramatic progress in artificial intelligence using recent breakthroughs in machine learning technology. Already AI can drive cars, recognize faces and diagnose medical conditions with astonishingly prescience.Artificial intelligence is also only in its childhood, but advancing very rapidly.So here’s the question…What happens when we combine the most potent AI techniques with quantum computers… what can we expect when we combine advanced machine learning with computers that are millions of times more powerful than the best we have today?The fact is, no one knows, but for the first time in technological history there is a very real chance that some sort of intelligence will emerge.It may not be independently creative like a human — or even much like a human at all — but it will certainly be able to out-think and out-plan us, able to play the game of life far better than we can.The Up Side…QI machines could be fantastically beneficial in more ways than we can count. We could ask them to work on humanity’s hardest problems and they may be able to come up with solutions no human ever though of, or even be capable of imagining.Or maybe we give the the toughest problems in mathematics and physics to solve, and maybe they can make breakthroughs all by themselves, things we can quickly put to good use.Perhaps we can even ask them to invent ever more potent generations of themselves.The convergence of AI with QC could dwarf any other technology development in human history. The possibilities are endless and the benefits could be huge.There is a down side, but it’s not what you think…Any reasonable person reading this must also ask, what happens if it goes wrong? Do we even understand what we’re doing here? It’s only natural to ask, how screwed are we if one of these things goes all psycho on us?Could it become Skynet and nuke us all? Will we see terminators ravaging the landscape? Could this lead us to a ‘rise of the machines’, completely out of control and bent on killing us?The answer is a resounding NO.You see, their very brilliance is what also makes quantum computers pathetically easy to kill… a single bullet penetrating the quantum isolation chamber will stop a QI in it’s tracks, stone cold dead. Permanently.Rogue machines aren’t a risk, instead the problem is with rogue people and nations, as usual.Quantum Wars…It’s easy to guess that the military of advanced nations like the USA, Russia, China, South Korea, Japan and members of the EU will be early and enthusiastic adopters of QI, once the money they are already pouring into research bears fruit.So the real threat isn’t a single Skynet-like machine going berserk, the danger is we get into a sort of quantumThat is what AI might be like 30 years from now.","87,297 followers",Shefali Naidu,9.4K,822,49.9M,2019,https://www.quora.com/How-much-technological-and-scientific-change-will-we-witness-in-the-next-decade

They still believe in hard work, agriculture and small business enterprises.The Corporate companies are patronized by most corrupt politicians in power. They loot national wealth. Probably they are sharing it with politicians. Otherwise how could they get ports, sea shores, mountains, forests, mines, aviation, shipping , banking, insurance, even defense manufacturing under their control. Tamils lack talents in corruption.The so-called Anti Brahman DMK is not led by Tamils.Many establishments are belonging to non Tamils in TamilNadu.Temples are with Brahmans.Caste discrimination is not uncommon in the state.Hope, Brahmans try to reform the way of living without casteless society.Jallikattu would have faded away. It was happening only in Madurai. Now it is happening everywhere. It is now taken over by politicians. Previously the BJP tried to hurt Tamils by removing Pongal holidays for central government employees in the state and tried to ban Jalli Kattu. It was seen as suppression of culture and rights of the people. Hence Jalli Kattu protest took place. BJP lost a chance of winning the Tamils’ support. I think they are not bothered.In the past the winners in Jalli Kattu were given preference to find better life partners. It was considered as bravery/valor. It was an ancient culture.Personally I do not patronize Jalli Kattu for men are injured and they lose their lives too. If they could conduct it with more protection I think there shouldn't be any concern.

No one can do everything, but you get a sense of satisfaction from doing one thing well.One thing I think we really need to try to do better is to frame our questions. Quora is a perfect example of how easy it is to ask a question badly. If you read answers “similar” to the one you ask, you may find that the question can be stated more clearly, or that it has already been answered. I’m not ready to advocate for changing Quora, but it might be possible to make it harder to ask a duplicative question without reading some of the previous answers. On the other hand, allowing people to ask their own question has its own value.One other thing we absolutely need to try to do better is be more respectful. I see a lot of questions evoke rude responses when it is clear to me that the problem with the question is due to the questioner having to write in a second language. I love the international quality of this website, even as I wish that people had to identify their locale when they ask questions.","21,229 followers",Charles Tips,569,4.4K,25.1M,2020,https://www.quora.com/How-much-technological-and-scientific-change-will-we-witness-in-the-next-decade

Anything is possible, but it is improbable for humanity to be drastically set back far enough to make recovery impossible short of an actual planet destruction scenario.",366 followers,Brett Alder,1.1K,0,0,2020,https://www.quora.com/In-the-next-5-years-how-much-of-a-jump-in-technology-will-we-see-What-about-in-10-20-and-30-years
