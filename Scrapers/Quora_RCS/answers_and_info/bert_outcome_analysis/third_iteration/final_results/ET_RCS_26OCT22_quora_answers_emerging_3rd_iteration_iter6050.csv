0,I am a inventor without money and great inventions. The companies are ignoring me and my science. Research is closed inside the Google and similar companies investing billions in research. Mercedes Benz doesn't want me and I am telling them that I have reached human superintelligence.Emerging companies are maybe more interested. Who do you think I should contact?My inventions and innovations and other intellectual property would save countless lives and bring prosperity.,1 follower,Xitong Zou,6.1K,3K,11.9M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Which-developed-country-is-trying-to-suppress-the-development-of-science-and-technology-in-emerging-economics

The thing is we have to take a look at the innards of a country to really know whether or not you are truly developed. That Chinese are so obsessed with portraying the facade that they are technologically advanced and ahead is actually an indication that they have not fully developed yet. Because fully developed countries have no need to show off things like that. Everyone knows they are developed.For example, here is San Francisco:Look, not many skyscrapers right? And look at those old cable cars going around! That must mean they are undeveloped right? Nope. Everyone knows San Francisco is a developed city. That’s why it has no need to show off with luxury skyscrapers and such things.Or how about Florence, Italy?Again, no skyscrapers here. But everyone knows it’s a developed city and Italy is a developed country.My point is, you have got to look at the people and the innards of a country to truly know if they are developed.This is the true face of China:You have got to look at the average person. Does the average Chinese have good access to healthcare (which is ranked near the bottom in WHO rankings btw)? Can they drink tap water safely? Do they have access to quality food? Do all have access to electricity or paved roads or a quality education? The answer is: probably, yes, if you are living in the rich east coast provinces of Jiangsu or Zhejiang or Guangdong- but not if you are living in say - Xinjiang or Gansu or Tibet. China’s wealth is not spread equally, neither is it developed equally. Even though the CCP has developed China quite fast - there is still a lot of work to be done making sure *every Chinese* have equal access to everything.And then you got to look at the attitude of the people. When I was in China I found that you really got to look out for who you trust, because there is a lot of scams going on all the time. You never know what is real, what is fake, what is real price of anything. Why do these scams exist? Because people have to be desperate to make money that’s why.Why are people desperate to make money? Probably because they are not making enough to survive, which is an indication that the country is still developing. You’ll notice that in general, the more developed a country is, the less likely there will be scams. In Korea/Japan/Taiwan, you will not find very many scams. In China and Eastern Europe it’s likely.Another aside I want to note is that Chinese bathrooms don’t contain any toilet paper. Do you know the reason why? It’s because people steal it. Now, in what developed country does this happen? I can’t think of any. Only in a developing country would you need to bring your own toilet paper to the bathroom because there isn’t any there due to fear of people stealing it.I find GDP/capita to be generally a pretty good indicator of how developed a country is. The average GDP/capita (PPP) of China is still around $8k/person. While that is higher than most Asian countries - it’s still below the 4 East Asian tigers + Japan and far from the $62k/person that the USA has.The true measure of a developed society is to observe the people that live in the country and not the appearance of the country itself. Chinese “face” culture is the same. You can just obviously see that China has developed really really fast, and mentality wise people are still harping about luxury products and consumerism - this is where Americans were back in the 50s, 60s and 70s, not now.The biggest consumers of luxury products are Chinese people, not Americans or Europeans. The more developed you are, the less need you have to validate your self worth with materialism. The less desire you have to spend thousands of dollars on your children's schooling just to send them to be educated abroad. The less need to travel to countries like Canada or USA for giving birth so that your child becomes a US or Canadian citizen, or to launder your money by buying up real estate in other countries. Developed countries do not need to do things like that.Thats why you should always pay attention to the old adage -Edit:Of course, Chinese commenters love to bring up the USA. Yes, USA has lots of impoverished areas too; every country has developed areas and undeveloped areas, however my point is that for China there is significantly more undeveloped areas at a higher % compared to the USA. The poverty rate for China is 16% as of 2019 and for USA it is 1.5% as of 2019.

But believe me, when it comes to anythWhen it comes to emotional and spiritual upliftment and rallying the community, and as treasured symbols of our roots, these people still have a purpose. But believe me, when it comes to anything beyond that, they have nothing useful to tell us.These people have no business telling us how to dress or what to eat, how to marry or divorce, or whether interest payments, adoption, or organ donation are “permissible,” OK?Oh what an extreme problem this is in our countries, and not just in the countries that your prejudice leads you to guess. Even a Jamaican told me that in her country, a doctor who takes the bus with poor people will acquire a bad reputation.How important is this?Israel encourages Palestinians and Arab Israelis to study vocational fields because (1) this prevents the formation of a credible intellectual revolutionary class and (2) it makes it easier for them to immigrate so they can be gotten rid of. Israel doesn't want more Edward Saids.The prelude event of the Armenian Genocide was for the Ottoman Empire to arrest almost 300 Armenian public intellectuals who lived in Constantinople and send most of them to their deaths.Shamefully I must say, Pakistan did the same to over a thousand Bangladeshi intellectuals in 1971.The first step to subjugating a people is to eliminate their thinkers.The few poor countries that became wealthy took some ideas from mainstream economics but also followed their own ideas, to the constant condemnation of the Western world. This applies to all the Asian Tigers and to China.Having taken a few courses on development economics, I can tell you that it's very complicated and nothing useful is yet known. The path of how a poor country can become advanced and wealthy is still a black hole for knowledge. Most likely it will be different and unique for each poor country.The World Bank and IMF are still running on garbage neo—liberalism which was not only discredited decades ago, but also was never based on real evidence in the first place. One thing is for sure, it very nicely serves the interests of Western capital.If we graduated 1/10th as many good academic economists as we do doctors, engineers and programmers who immigrate and never return, we would get somewhere.During the Cold War, the Soviet Union was subjected to the harshest sanctions. But neighbouring Communist countries like Romania, Albania, Bulgaria, etc., were treated more leniently — in order to drive a wedge between them and the USSR.After the Cold War, this stayed the same. The US is brutal with Russia, but kind to Kazakhstan. It's brutal with China, but kind to Mongolia. And so on.Stop wasting your breath on something imaginary.It's been 60—70 years since the era of decolonization. How do you think France and Britain are still among the top 10 economies? And the Netherlands 17th? It makes sense that they enriched themselves by owning continents, but how about now?Wake up. Their soldiers and administrators left our countries, but they're still ruling us more subtly.Who can understand how to keep us divided and exploit our divisions, better than the ones who invented our borders and statehood in the first place?It worked like a charm. Results, however absurd, are guaranteed. 70 years after the British gave their blessing to the breakup of India, India and Pakistan each spend X billion dollars to maintain vast forces on their borders in the Himalayas, where only yaks and snow leopards live.Who profits from this problem?We need to develop a unity of countries and peoples who are in the same position — poor, underdeveloped, historically colonized, and to this day politically subdued and frequently threatened by the West.Nobody told us this when we had to learn English.","113,621 followers",Anuradha Tiwari,4.2K,0,0,2020,https://www.quora.com/Which-developed-country-is-trying-to-suppress-the-development-of-science-and-technology-in-emerging-economics

I think AI will kill jobs, and over time, AI might kill most “jobs” as we know them.

I think AI will kill jobs, and over time, AI might kill most “jobs” as we know them. I think that people are somewhat complacent in regard to the economic impact of AI, and will likely be ill-prepared for the changes we have to adapt to in the not-so-distant future.First, let's start with the comparisons to machinery and automation. They did indeed put factory workers out of work. In that respect, I agree AI today is similar in many applications, replacing workers who have less specialized skills, perhaps call center operators, office assistants (in a limited extent), and maybe soon, taxi drivers and truck drivers. But I would argue that AI is fundamentally different from machinery or most of the other analogies commonly made when answering this question, because AI is growing and is unlikely to stop growing. It's growing in breadth (of applications and industries), in geographic and economic scope, and in power (it's capacity to address increasingly complex tasks). A more fitting analogy would be machinery in an automobile plant that not only made the parts one day, but then learned how to assemble them the week after, and then how to design cars a year later.I think that there is little that is out of reach for advanced AI of the future. Let's leave the question of the AI singularity alone for now. Instead, I think that deep learning efforts at Google and elsewhere are making AI systems learn faster and faster, with a growing rate of acceleration. Advanced AI can now address increasingly complex tasks including medical diagnosis, stock market trading, weather prediction and human behavioral modeling. Very soon, it will be able to take the place of certain types of teachers, and find a role in education. It can already deal with complex systems in software and mathematics, and seems to be only limited in applications that require interactions with the physical world (sensors are still imperfect), and with people.So without projecting too far into the future, we can ask the question, what jobs will NOT be killed by AI? Jobs that involve labor are already (or soon to be) replaced. Jobs that require logical reasoning are being replaced, albeit at a slower rate. What are the qualities that humans have that cannot be captured by AI? Perhaps creativity, emotional responses? So perhaps researchers in academia will survive longer than most, and artists (though AI stylistic mimicry is already quite impressive and their results enjoyable), and counselors/psychologists/case workers, and decision makers like CEOs who cannot be predictable or error prone. And hopefully software engineers and algorithm designers who develop AI systems.This leaves a very, very small portion of today's jobs intact. Many say: we just need to train people to fill higher level jobs created by AI, e.g. Programmers, ML researchers. But this is no easy feat. The US educational system is struggling to meet the demands created by advanced technology today. This failure is in part responsible for the economic divide plaguing the country today. The challenge of educating the public for a job market that is both decreasing in scope and increasing in complexity, is nothing we've ever faced before.I am far from original in this opinion. But if I had to guess, I would say that AI will put far more people out of work than we can (re)train in time. That will have significant economic repercussions as corporations seeking to minimize cost will do so at the cost of rising unemployment. There will need to be dramatic changes in social policies in order to avert large scale economic disaster, first dramatic rises in minimum wage, then eventually some type of universal income/welfare. It's the kind of change that requires significant leadership in our government, something that seems woefully absent today.","135,541 followers",Hector Quintanilla,3.1K,1.2K,88.6M,2017,https://www.quora.com/Which-developed-country-is-trying-to-suppress-the-development-of-science-and-technology-in-emerging-economics
