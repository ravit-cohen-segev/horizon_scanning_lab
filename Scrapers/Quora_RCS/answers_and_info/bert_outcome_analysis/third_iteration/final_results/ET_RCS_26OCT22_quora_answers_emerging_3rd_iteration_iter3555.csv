In the final battle, Luke Skywalker flies his X-wing fighter at extremely low level through a trench on the powerful Death Star, in order to fire missiles at the space stations core. His super space fighter is equipped with a navigation and targeting computer. The cockpit display looks like this :This system presumably helps Skywalker to fly as low as possible without hitting the surface. It also acts as a bombing computer, basically telling the pilot when to push the fire button to hit its target. This was 1977 Sci-Fi level technology.Now, twelve years earlier, in 1965, very real US naval aviators, flying the very real A-6 Intruder bomber, were flying bombing missions over North Vietnam. The A-6 had what was called DIANE (Digital Integrated Attack/Navigation Equipment). The pilot‚Äôs display looked like this :Instead of looking outside (and seeing nothing, since the A-6s flew at night in bad weather), the pilot watched this screen that clearly - for a trained eye - showed relief and distances. It also conveniently provided navigation hints.This picture actually shows what the late 80s A-6E Intruder Vertical Display Indicator looked like. The Vietnam era VDI was more crude, and at one point orange, I think, instead of green. That being said, it was still an impressive piece of technology for its time :> Kaiser Aircraft & Electronics (now Kaiser Electronics) built the first instrumentation system in the late 1950s. The original operational display presented ground and sky texture to the pilot with a well-defined horizon for attitude, ‚Äúhighway in the sky‚Äù for steering and numerous other symbols for execution of various attack maneuvers.‚ÄúLife of the Intruder‚Äù, Naval Aviation News, 1997 [ https://www.history.navy.mil/content/dam/nhhc/research/histories/naval-aviation/Naval%20Aviation%20News/1990/1997/september-october/intruder.pdf ]Here is how Brian Bryans, former A-6 pilot and author of Flying Low, describes the VDI as he discovered it in the mid 60s :> An A-6 pilot had the world‚Äôs largest attitude indicator centered on the instrument panel right in front of his face. It was similar in size and appearance to the early TV screens and was called a VDI. It had a pale orange glow and showed an artificial horizon across the middle of its screen with puffy white clouds over it. [‚Ä¶] When it got real black outside, you turned up the rosy glow on the VDI and it looked like you were over Kansas on a sunny day. [‚Ä¶] The computer generated a curved path on the VDI, so all the pilot had to do was to follow the yellow brick road across ‚ÄúKansas‚Äù.The Terrain Clearance Mode (using the data from the Terrain Following Radar) allowed the pilot to fly low and follow the relief to avoid radar detection and Surface to Air Missile. (The A-6 autopilot could not, as I had first written, do terrain following.)The A-6 also did its own bombing. Once over its target, it told the pilot how it ...","5,084 followers",Bobby Tatro,3.9K,2.2K,45.6M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Do-you-think-the-government-has-thousands-of-years-advanced-technology-hidden-somewhere-Do-you-think-they-already-know-everything-and-have-a-plan-for-the-next-thousand-years

Source of livelihood-Indian being Agrarian economy gives employment to 47% of population currently and thus helps them earn income so as to survive.2. Industrial Development-Agriculture sector is both source of use of inputs produced by industrial sector(like fertilizers etc) and its outputs are used as raw materials in industries (for ex cotton).Thus it helps in development of same.3.Contribution in GDP- GDP of a country is measure of ots growth.Around 19 to 20% of GDP share is from agriculture sector which is quite large.4.Better Economic Planning- If crop of a season is good,income generated is good and thus country gains proper resources to use in economic planning for development of country.5.Source of food supply- Indian population is increasing continuously.Indian agriculture is thus trying to work in desired manner with proper investment in required technology to serve food to huge population.DISADVANTAGE OF AGRICULTURE IN INDIA1. Inequality in land distribution- There is a considerable degree of concentration of land holding along rhe such farmer, moneylender, landlords. Vast majority of small farmer owns a land of very small area, which is socially unjustified.2. Land tenure system- It is suffering form lot of defects the problem of insecurity of tenanve or eviction still is in rural areas.3. Inadequate use of inputs - Due to lack of financial resources, Indian farmers are not applying varieties of resoify like HYV seeds, fertilizer and pesticides4. Inadequate irrigation facilities - About an observation, around 40% agriculture remains Unirrigated due to lack of irrigation due to lack of contribute in GDP.5. Poor farming techniques- Majority of Indian farmers are adopting Orthodox or inefficient technique of farming, this type of method is generally used for low agriculture.","1,594 followers",Michael Van In,631,1.5K,2.9M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Do-you-think-the-government-has-thousands-of-years-advanced-technology-hidden-somewhere-Do-you-think-they-already-know-everything-and-have-a-plan-for-the-next-thousand-years
