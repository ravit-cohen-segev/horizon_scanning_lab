It might even hit $30,000.Afterwards, the price will dump and stay that way for months.But then, about a year and a half after that, so late 2021 / 2022, or maybe even a bit longer due to crypto becoming a more mature market, the price will begin a parabolic ascent to $100,000 +.

It’s extremely improbable and effectively impossible to recover lost coins. As of March 31st, 2015, the total value of lost bitcoins was estimated at about $1.23 billion USD. A more recent number from late 2016 suggests that up to 25% of the circulating bitcoins(that’s just over 4 million) are “dead”, that would bring the estimate up to around $25 billion USD.When Will the Last Bitcoin be Mined?Bitcoin Halving Events.This is a pretty important concept to understand in order to fully understand when the last Bitcoin will be mined. Every four years or so, the amount of new bitcoin created and earned by miners with each new block of transactions is **cut in half**. This is part of bitcoin’s predictable, transparent monetary policy, which can be verified in the source code available on the Bitcoin Core GitHub repository.Bitcoin Block Reward ChartCurrently we are in reward era number 3 and there is approximately just under three more years to go until the mining reward is lowered by half. As you can see in the chart above, there will be a total of 34 “reward eras”.Originally, 50 bitcoins were earned as a reward for mining a block. Then it dropped 25 bitcoins, and then to 12.5 bitcoins. In 2020, it’ll drop to 6.25 bitcoins.So if we do the math, if there is a halving event every four years,What Happens When the Last Bitcoin is Mined?Will the whole system shut down because Bitcoins are no longer awarded for mining new blocks? Probably not. Bitcoin miners are also awarded transaction fees, and these fees should keep Bitcoin afloat. As the the price of bitcoin increases, the fees allocated per each transaction will also increase. Take a look at this chart outlining the average Bitcoin transaction fee over time:Bitcoin Fees Over TimeEventually, these transaction fees should become valuable enough that it will encourage miners to keep on mining even though they won’t be getting a block reward. So while new bitcoins will cease to come into existence, bitcoin miners will still get paid. Of course, some miners will be (and already are) pushed out of the market.The idea, however, of bitcoins some day being worth $50,000 or a $100,000, isn’t outside the realm of reason. But regardless, for the time being, we have to make the most of the situation. Most people don’t realize that there are ways to keep making profits regardless of the state of the cryptocurrency market at different points in time, for example, a billion-dollar investment company like Coinstarhaven (www.coinstarhaven,com) is a company I invest my Bitcoin and Ethereum with, you get double your cryptocurrency investments after 7 days.

Ten years ago, all you needed was a reasonably powerful computer, a stable internet connection and the foresight of Nostradamus. These days, thanks to industrial bitcoin mining operations,Mining is the backbone of all proof-of-work blockchains and can be described with three key concepts:Transaction RecordsThe verification and addition of transactions to the public blockchain ledger. This is where you can view every single transaction that has ever occured in the history of the blockchain.Proof-of-Work CalculationsThe energy-intensive puzzle that each Bitcoin mining machine solves every ten minutes. The miner that completes the puzzle before anything else adds the new block to the blockchain.Bitcoin Block RewardRewarded with 6.25 bitcoins. This number reduced to 6.25 bitcoins after the halving in May 2020. The reward (plus transaction fees) are paid to the miner who solved the puzzle first.How do Bitcoin miners calculate their earnings?You’ve probably heard the scare of bitcoins mining energy consumption. Regardless of whether the impact is overblown by the media, it’s a fact that the underlying cost of mining is the energy consumed.The revenue from mining has to outweigh those costs, plus the original investment into mining hardware, in order to be profitable. one modern Bitcoin mining machine (commonly known as an ASIC), like the Whatsminer M20S, generates around $8 in Bitcoin revenue every day. If you compare this to the revenue of mining a different crypto currency, like Ethereum, which is mined with graphics cards, you can see that the revenue from Bitcoin mining is twice that of mining with the same amount GPUs you could buy for one ASIC.How do you know if you can profit from Bitcoin mining?First of all, Bitcoin mining has a lot of variables. However, when done efficiently it is possible to end up with more bitcoin from mining than from simply hodling. One of the most important variables for miners is the price of Bitcoin itself. Bitcoin price, naturally, impacts all miners. However, there are three factors that separate profitable miners from the rest: cheap electricity, low cost and efficient hardware and a good mining pool.These days, every miner needs to mine through a mining pool or cloud mining. Whether you are mining with one machine, or several thousand, the network of Bitcoin mining machines is so large that your chances of regularly finding a block (and therefore earning the block reward and transaction fees) is very low.ConclusionIf you have put in the effort to learn about mining, and you have found a location with low cost electricity for your machines, then you still need to consider where to store the bitcoin that you mine. It is possible to mine direct from the pool to an exchange but i recommend you keep your bitcoin in a wallet where you have access to the private keys.","3,158 followers",Jammie Glen,886,106,641K,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-best-and-most-profitable-hardware-for-Bitcoin-in-2020

I have a mortgage still, but that’s almost finished (we’ve had the house for 5 years, and it’ll be paid off by the Fall - if things keep going as they do) but I just paid off my Toyota Tundra and my wife’s Audi Q6 after having them for only 1.5 years. I pay for my own insurance, keep a roof over my family’s head, keep food in the fridge and take a vacation every couple years or so.So, yes, I can make a ‘living’ trading.Can you?Probably not.And I say that with the most utter and supreme confidence that I can muster. There are very few things I am absolutely certain about - but you becoming profitable as a day trader from your home? Not gonna happen.Why?Because it is nearly impossible. Listen - most people have absolutely no idea what kind of a mind f**k trading is. Literally - almost no one does. I’ve met 5 total independent traders like me - and I’m about the most normal one out of that 5. The others are just phenomenal traders, gods among men, its magic what they can do - but they are each of them a wreck of a human being. They’ve lost their families and their sanity. They’ve experienced such psychological and emotional suffering from their journey to profitability that they are forever blessed and cursed from that journey.Trading will ruin you. If, by the grace of God, you survive trading and becoming profitable, you won’t be the same. You will be forever changed in both your mood and your mannerisms. You will be emotionally scarred. You will become psychologically damaged. You will suffer panic attacks.Trading is the antithesis of normal human behavior because, in order to make money, you have to risk the thing that keeps a roof over your head, food in your belly, clothes on your back and provides those things for your family as well - you have to risk your money.I got lucky. I have the most amazing and supportive wife in the world. I try to remember to tell folks that my ability to be a profitable trader, my journey to profitability, the results I currently have - it’s a partnership between me and my wife.I can not tell you what kind of sh*t she had to put up with or the anxiety and pain I put our family through so that I could try to make my dream come true. My wife kept her own fears, tears, pain, anxiety, and panic hidden - for us - for me. She should have left me, she should have dropped my ass and told me I was loser and f*ck-up. But she didn’t. Maybe she figured she’d gamble on my endeavors and just said to herself ‘go all in I guess’. Maybe she thought ‘I can always make it on my own if he drags us too far down.’ Because she could - she doesn’t need me to provide for her financially.So I got lucky. I suffered horrible shame and self-loathing after blowing two large accounts - all of my life savings because I am a God-damned idiot. But my wife knew my passion and knew I was good at it, I just had to tackle the things that were limiting my ability to be profitable.But to your question? No - you don’t make a living as a day trader.Day trading is a lifestyle - it’s part of who I am, it’s a constant and as much a part of my soul as anything else in my life. I am constantly connected to the market and aware of it - even while asleep. It’s the thing I go to bed excited about at night and its the thing that makes me wake up excited every morning. It’s the thing I do from 5 AM to 9 PM because I love it.But I will tell you right now - DO NOT TRY IT, EVER.UPDATE FOR COMMENTS BELOW (Feb. 17th, 2019):First, I am very humbled by the words from folks who have gone through the same hell I’ve gone through to do what I love to do. I’ll go through some quick answers to points and hopefully they will be sufficient for everyone to understand without me having to copy/paste the answer :-)1. Quit trading stocks.

Regarding previous article from 2017/ 2018 (As a matter of fact, emergence of big and industrial-scale players brought a new level of competition into the blockchain industry and made it difficult for smaller players who had access to more costly resources!Looking at the records in 2018,It is worth noting that we had an emergence of lending crypto platforms in 2019 that were ready to lend you Dollar or USDT based on your Bitcoin deposit without even any credit check. This was good news for many average-scale miners to strengthen their computing power of mining through this new stream of fund.Bitfarms mining facility in CanadaThe most used mining machine in 2018 wasIt’s clear that mining Bitcoin is a competition and whoever compete in better resources specially energy will overcome others. Comparing to 2018, the year 2019 this competition was way more bloody tight and costly that put many small-scale miners in hesitance whether they should continue mining in their current way.If the good electricity price for mining was 0.05 $cent in 2018, it was around 0.03 $cent/ kwh in 2019. Therefore, the competition for mining more Bitcoin turned into the competition for obtaining the cheapest source of energy in every corner of the world from Latin America Chile and Paraguay to the north of Europe Norway and Sweden to the farthest cold deserts and mountains in Siberia and Magnolia!!Actually 2019 was a start for a race to posses all the efficient and cheap sources of energy all over the world -Northern Bitcoin underground facilities in north of NorwayActually 2019 was a start for a race to posses all the efficient and cheap sources of energy all over the world -a race to energy!According to energy price above 10 Euro/ kwh, Europe was already kicked out of competition in 2018. However, some could find good places in in north of Europe like Norway or Finland but those capacities are not that much to make them a hot bed for bitcoin miners. In 2019, the European company Northern Bitcoin developed their facilities in Maloy Norway bu succeeding in attracting new financial investment through selling their stock in Frankfurt Stock Exchange. Their share-value is now around 7.5 million Euro in Frankfurt. They claims they will extend their capacity of mining upto 120 Mw by the time new stream of fund injected.Hut8 mining containers in Alberta, CanadaTwo Canadian corporate-scale crypto mining firm Hut8 and Bitfarms have capacity of each 100 MW to supply their miners.Hut8mining is formed by joint partnership of Bitfury (ASIC producer) and Galaxy digital (owned by Mike Novogratz) in 2017 and has succeeded to add up their computing capacity frequently.On the other hand, Bitfarms founded by Israili-Canadian investors and owned by the famous millionaire co-founder Pierre-Luc Quimper, have successfully developed their mining facilities in Quebec, Canada. Contrary to Hut8mining, Bitfarms has its own technical team to overhaul and maintaining miners and infrastructures.They already bought and possessed the electrical company Volta with more than 40 person employees to perform the maintenance task and technical support so that they could increase the profit margin for the whole mother company and fast technical repairment to keep the miners up-time in high levels.Canada has turned into a Bitcoin-friendly country at least for miners thanks to its competitive cheap renewable energy sources mostly hydroelectricity. According to the records in 2019, you could find hydro energy with the cost of around 4 $cent/KWh in various part of Canada such as Vancouver, Alberta and Quebec. Although this price is not the best one, it is a decent price among other competitors. Why not best?! Could you find cheaper than 4 $cent?!....The answer is yes. You could find lower prices per KWh in United States in Texas, California, New York, Washington state, Montana. For instance, the new Bitcoin company HashChain has some facility of 12000 miner for crypto mining both Bitcoin and altcoins in Montana, US with the cost of 3 $cent/ Kwh. Moreover, thanks to flare gas generators, you can produce significantly cheap prices even below 3 $cent/ KWH in places holding gas wells like Texas - which is awesome!!DMG crypto mining facility Vancouver, CanadaTexas has turned into a new heaven for Bitcoin miners till the announcement of some energy firms there to provide very good price electricity to those interested in large-scale Bitcoin mining. For example, we could name Bitmain, the biggest name in ASIC manufacturing, announced in 2019 that intends to establish a big farm of 300 MW capacity in Texas in cooperation with DMG Blockchain company as the contractor and developer of the project. There’s no clue about the energy price in the contract between Bitmain and Texas energy firm but some speculations say, it’s around awesome price of 2 $cent/ Kwh!!...II- Bitcoin Mining in 2020 – A race to Energy!Year 2019 had very big achievements for crypto mining industry and lead to big flux of investments and funds into this disruptive economy. We have been witnessing several mining companies entering into financial markets like public stock exchanges and accessing to more financial instruments to finance and lowering their risks by hedging techniques. As such, this will continue also toThis revolution has already started at the end of 2019 by the liquidity provider group GSR. They have formed a startup joint with Caanan, big name in ASIC manufacturing, to introduce derivative products to crypto mining companies so that they could vast effectively mitigate Bitcoin market volatility and higher their margin profits. You see?!...Every year this disruptive industry of blockchain is growing their legs in every branch of economy. I would say an octopus growth!Rich Rosenblum, GSR co-founder, told CoinDesk that the companies were specifically offering two products: “a tailored risk management solution for miners,” which provides an average-priced option or swap contract, and a new type of futures contract that trades based on hash rate.Apart from the emergence of hedging instruments for crypto miners, year 2020 will be aItaipu dam in Paraguay- Golden Goose project power supplierThis race-to-energy has already initiated in 2019. For instance, some Korean investment holding has pre contracted forThe name of the project is Golden Goose and owned by a Korean foundation named Commons Foundation which has entered into an agreement with Paraguay to construct what it claims will be a large mining hub. The government has provided five 10,000-square-meter plots of land to host five planned mining centers. The land is in close proximity to a massive hydroelectric power plant.The best spots and regions for Bitcoin mining are typically built around gas power plants as well as hydro plants amongst which the second one is renewable and a better source to rely on for a sustainable future.Therefore, Canada is one of these spots appropriate for mining thanks to its huge source of renewables including Hydro plants originated from its mountains’ waters. Moreover, regarding its cold climate, it makes it an efficient place for natural cooling of the Bitcoin factory.United States is also turning into a Bitcoin-friendly region gradually; however, not in all the states for sure. As regarding renewables, there are some large-scale renewable plants in US solar and wind that could be used for Bitcoin mining. The important point to mention is that typically solar and wind energies are not economically justified for mining since their least price for selling is above 9 $cent /kwh and this price means death for miners!! Nevertheless, for large and bigger solar or wind farms usually in range of 500 MW-1000 MW, it is possible to sell the output energy in the way lower prices then smaller renewable farms and even in the range below 3 $cent per KWh!But since there aren’t many places around the world to have such a large farm or capable of building it, then you can find very special places in the world to sell you solar/wind energy cheap enough for Bitcoin mining.Amongst these places we can name Mojave, California which a good place for establishing solar panels and produce renewable energy. A new company named Plouton mining already started to build a small mining farm of 5000 miner powered by solar energy.However, this is a small scale solar plant! Is it economical?!...Actually if you have access to good line of credit and long-term loans and other incentives then it could be economical to deploy a small solar farm to be injected into a Bitcoin farm. Hence, they should have obtained a decent finance for their solar farm to the extent that they can bring the production cost of their panels down below 4 $cent per Kwh, otherwise it is not reasonable for them to mine Bitcoin there.Plouton Mining site in Mojave, CaliforniaSo you see this race-to-energy already reached US lands and it is not even limited to renewables but also gas generators and flare gas plants. Utilizing flare gas, which is a wasted gas, to produce energy has found its economic roadmap into Bitcoin mining solution.As such, we are witnessing some start-ups and new companies have started to develop Bitcoin farms along with their own manufactured generators with very very cheap output electricity around 1.5-2 $cent for each Kwh. Examples could be founds in Texas, Illinois and Canada and it is going to take a huge market in 2020. So we can say flare gas could be a golden waste for bitcoiners in 2020!Let’s get back to mining machines and their efficiency growth in 2019. Actually ASIC mining started with 28 nm ASIC chips and then by progress of new tech mother manufacturers like TSMC (which is main chip producer for Bitmain, Caanan,…) new generation of 14 nm ASIC introduced into market in 2017 and this continued into newer generations of ASICs 10nm, and 7nm in 2019.The most famous legendary miner Antminer s9 (by Bitmain) had hashing power of 14.5 Th/s and it was a tech-jump in the time of release in 2017. It’s efficiency was 0.093 J/GH and due to table in the article “What is a good Bitcoin mining hardware?” it would resulted in efficiency of 1% comparing to other ASIC miners.However, in next years the progress in ASIC technology continued till release of new ASIC generations. For instance s11 and a short after s15 succeeded to improve efficiency to 1.5% which was a noticeable improvement with respect to S9.But this wasn’t the end! Since new 7-nm ASICs showed up and lead to release better machines like Antminer s17 with computing power of 53 Th/s. This was an amazing achievement since it lead to performance of 0.039 J/GH or according to aforementioned article an efficiency of 2% which was a great news for the miners in lack of electrical capacity as well as those with higher energy prices.In 2020, we are expecting to see even newer ASIC chips of 5-nm with output efficiency of more than 2.5% that could be improved to higher rates with even better controlling firmware. As we see, Bitcoin not only made his way through technological barriers but also has improved the edge-of-science by its intrinsic value and incentivized economy. However, the older version of miners like Whatsminer m3 and antminer s9 are still widely in use by most of miners and the new efficient fleet will replace them gradually.Another significant factor of Bitcoin mining is how you are cooling your mining machines and environment. Since they give out high temp air and heat so choosing the best and efficient solution for Bitcoin farms is necessary.Although many circles this problem by choosing a region with cold climates like Canada and Siberia, it is still needed the least cooling systems for the hotter seasons or other regions with warm climates.As I already discussed cooling issues in the articles How is a calculated needed cooling system for a Bitcoin mining farm and What infrastructure is required for Bitcoin mining and How do I configure it? There have been developing several solutions for Bitcoin farm cooling. The most simple and effective one is air cooling and air fans. The advantage is that it is very cost effective in terms of initial and maintenance expenses and the defect is that it could only be used for light and normal cooling best suited with places with medium and average temp climate.For more warmer places specially in summer you could use evaporative pads beside the air fans so that you can have a more effective cooling system with a negligible cost. For those very fussy in infrastructure designing, datacenter cooling systems and design could be an specific method to be deployed in establishing their Bitcoin farm; however, it exerts much more initial expenses or capex to the owner.Liquid cooling is a way used by some miners round the world but the method was left very soon as resulted in more cost/efficiency in most cases. Actually, liquid cooling or to be more specific 1-phase liquid cooling has a very good effect in circulate or distributing heat out of miners environment but as soon as it comes to heat exchangers or radiators for getting cool, it has nothing to say more than simple air cooling.Nevertheless, there is other method of liquid cooling named 2-phase cooling or 2-phase immersion cooling, which is a real solution to reduce temperature of mining liquid. Bitfury is one of the pioneer companies that has used this method in their mining containers in Hut8 mining farm in Canada. There still remains an issue of cost and effective rate and if its cost deserves to make it deployed as final solution.....III-	Hopes and RisksInterest in cryptocurrencies has surged since 2015 as bitcoin has seen its value rise from about $300 per coin to a peak of about $20,000 per coin in December 2017, then dropping to about $8,000 per coin as of November 2019.Mining cryptocurrency seems like a no-brainer. Set up a computer to help solve complex math puzzles and you are rewarded with a coin or a fraction of a coin. The first bitcoin miners were able to earn coins relatively quickly just using what computing power they had in their homes.By 2019, cryptocurrency mining has become a little more complicated and involved. With bitcoin, the reward is halved every four years. On top of that, serious miners have built huge arrays to mine, making it harder for smaller miners to compete. You can join a bitcoin mining pool to be more effective, but that comes with a fee, reducing your profits.Investing in expensive equipment and spending high prices in energy bills to mine bitcoin only makes sense if you believe the price of bitcoin will rise by the time! The market of Bitcoin is still small comparing to Gold, metals or big companies like Apple and Amazon. Those that decided to invest in this industry, already hopes that Bitcoin will hugely adopted by crowds all over the world and the its market cap will reach easily above 1000 Billion$.So you see it’s about how much faith or hope you have in this revolution (blockchain and Bitcoin) and how much you are going to risk to be an early Bitcoin adopter or miner in the following years. But what the situation is currently for Bitcoin mining is a high-risk high-reward investment. I myself believe that Crypto Is a Revolution of hope, equality, and wealth decentralization and as such I strongly think it will succeed.The important Halving Event of Bitcoin in 2020:The current global bitcoin network rewards miners 12.5 bitcoin per block, which is approximately 1,800 bitcoin per day. In May 2020, the bitcoin daily reward will halve to 6.25 bitcoin per block, or approximately 900 bitcoin per day. This halving may have a potential impact on the Company’s profitability at the reward level of 6.25 coins.Based on the fundamentals of bitcoin mining and historical data on bitcoin prices and the network difficulty rate after a halving event, it is unlikely that the network difficulty rate and price would remain at the current level when the bitcoin rewards per block are halved.Bitcoiners believe that although the halving would reduce the block reward by 50%, other market factors such as the network difficulty rate and price of bitcoin would change to offset the impact of the halving sufficiently for the Company to maintain profitability.Nevertheless, there is a risk that a halving will render mining companies unprofitable and unable them to continue their existence . However, according to my knowledge and record we are at the most pessimistic level of Bitcoin price 7000$ in Dec 2019 which could be also valid as the bottom line for Halving time.As matter of fact, I don’t believe in any sudden price change in the time of Halving but I expect a gradual Bitcoin price increase to a more reasonable price which originates from a trade-off between network difficulty and miners expectations as well as growing demands by new bitcoin adopters. I see that price to be around 15000 $ in the following months in 2020.By :",0 followers,Melissa Aldridge,501,0,0,2021,https://www.quora.com/Have-all-bitcoins-already-been-mined

14,"How To Mine BitcoinWhile mining bitcoin was once a feasible endeavor for home mining with accessible hardware, mining BTC is now largely dominated by large crypto mining companies. Sometimes called crypto mining farms, these operations may use hundreds — or thousands — of ASIC miners optimized to mine BTC, which uses the SHA-256 algorithm. These ASIC bitcoin miners are hot, noisy, and expensive — with prices varying from $2,000 – $15,000 USD each.

For these reasons and more, mining BTC from home is more of a throwback to the early days of Bitcoin circa 2010, when the competition was lower and mining with home hardware was more feasible.Nowadays, while there’s nothing stopping you from trying to mine BTC solo using a CPU, your chances of winning a block reward are statistically lower than winning the lottery. Even if you join a mining pool, the payout you’d receive from mining bitcoin with CPUs and GPUs would be miniscule, and would almost certainly be revenue negative as any crypto payouts you’d receive in BTC would be overshadowed by the electricity costs your CPU or GPU miners would accumulate. While BTC has become a highly competitive mining field, there are many more cryptocurrencies with which you can engage.How To Mine EtherEther (ETH) is the native cryptocurrency of the Ethereum network, and has become one of the most popular coins for those crypto-mining at home. Some passionate ETH miners even have GPU mining rigs that have numerous cards in each unit. As Ethereum uses the ethash algorithm — one that prioritizes small-scale miners with GPU hardware — it doesn’t require a large-scale mining farm to be competitive. That being said, GPUs can’t mine as efficiently as FPGA miners, and many GPU miners have transitioned to mining smaller cap altcoins.In addition, some of the biggest crypto mining rig manufacturers are working on ASIC ether miners that could make both GPU and FPGA mining of ETH largely obsolete. In fact, there is already an ETH ASIC miner on the market with an impressive hash rate of 720 megahashes per second (mh/s), although some question whether its high price is worth the increased hash rate and energy efficiency.Looking ahead, Ethereum is migrating from Proof of Work (PoW) to Proof of stake (PoS), a consensus mechanism that does not require hardware mining. This will make ETH no longer mineable after phase 2 of Ethereum 2.0 is implemented. On PoS blockchains, you are rewarded for staking your coins to support the network in lieu of the crypto mining rewards on PoW blockchains.",UNKNOWN,Daniel Augustine (UR),5.2K,309,1.3M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-best-and-most-profitable-hardware-for-Bitcoin-in-2020
