1,"Yes, but it also somewhat depends on your definition of “God.”Humans will never achieve fully unlimited power, but we will come very close. Just like we have the power to completely destroy every human being on our Earth with the press of a button, we could have the capability to destroy the entire universe anywhere from 200–2,000 years.Another development that will arrive soon is a collective consciousness and superintelligent AI. We could have an AI that could answer virtually any question, and we could all upload our brains to a cloud system that gives us virtually unlimited intelligence.

We could have an AI that could answer virtually any question, and we could all upload our brains to a cloud system that gives us virtually unlimited intelligence. Of course, we will never be fully omniscient, but there would be little to no functional difference.I could almost liken it to the difference between the decimal .3 and fraction 1/3. The more 3’s you add on the end, the closer it gets. The number .3333 has virtually no functional difference from 1/3. Of course, it will never truly be 1/3, just as humans will never be omniscient, but it won’t be much different.Or, if you think being God simply means having full control of the destiny of other beings, we already are gods in many aspects.For example, am I a God to the little ant crawling past me? I could feed it, kill it, drown it, or put it on a tree branch and take it back to its nest. In this sense, am I “God” to this ant?",3 followers,Samuel Bateman,1.1K,102,56.4K,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-is-5G-and-what-does-it-mean-to-you

3,"No, I don’t think so. This implies that there is a stopping point. Technology will continue to evolve as long as there are intelligent species interested in pursuing it.Also, what does it mean to be as powerful as a god? That really doesn’t have any definition.","220,628 followers",Franklin Veaux,1.8K,47.3K,783M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Will-technology-continue-to-evolve-until-humans-are-as-powerful-as-gods
4,"Q: Does God evolve?A: Well, he had a chance when he actually got a son.But then he offed that kid as a sacrifice to himself before he ever got the chance to reproduce. And since evolution happens in the generation shift from parent to offspring, through variation and selection, the god species ended nailed to a tree for suggesting that we could be nice to one another for a change some 2000-ish years ago, and has since been extinct on the planet.",366 followers,Brett Alder,1.1K,0,0,2018,https://www.quora.com/Will-technology-continue-to-evolve-until-humans-are-as-powerful-as-gods

6,"Our genome have been evolving for as long as life on earth been evolving, this is at least for 3.5 billion years, but most probably more than 4 billion years. Of course for the most part of that time biologists wouldn't call our ancestors humans.The rest of the story depends on what you call human. The whole genus Homo or just Homo Sapiens? Homo sapiens first appeared around 200–300 thousand years ago, genus Homo is around 2-3 million years old. The border is unclear because of two reasons.

Not all the details of how exactly Australopitecines evolved into Homo, so there is some room for debate and any new fossil or new study of an existing fossil could change the balance in that debate. Second reason is, borders between species are somewhat arbitrary as changes happened slowly over the span of hudreds of thousands of years.",366 followers,Brett Alder,1.1K,0,0,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-is-5G-and-what-does-it-mean-to-you
7,"It would be possible, but look how difficult it's been to share the planet with the same species. Besides, who's to say that the other species, if it's even close to our level of intelligence, would want to share the Earth with us?",5 followers,Dave Williams,891,879,682.4K,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-is-5G-and-what-does-it-mean-to-you
8,"It doesn’t seem likely, does it?We seem incapable of sharing it with our own species. We can pick a fight on the most spurious of reasons, like how many of your King’s relatives are alive, or which sky fairy your priests tell you is the only one.Ask the Denisovians or the Neanderthals. Oh, that’s right. you can’t.","14,900 followers",Krister Sundelin,2.2K,23.8K,89.8M,2017,https://www.quora.com/Will-technology-continue-to-evolve-until-humans-are-as-powerful-as-gods
9,"A while back I used to play a pen&paper role playing games called Shadowrun. Basic theme, in a slightly dystopian future magic comes back to the world and many people mutate to other races, e.g. elves , dwarves and trolls.The interesting part in this context, racism ceases to exist. Why? Because it relationship to a troll (still a sentient and largely humanoid creature) racism simply makes no sense anymore. That would be like separating people based on length of eyebrows in a marathon, when you are overtaken by a motorbike.It shows the arbitrary importance we assign to races.

If there was a second species I assume we would focus all our fear and other fantastic ability to behave enormously egocentrically stupid on this second species, instead against our own.But I also assume, just in the same way as we are able to overcome made up concepts such as races and nations, we could also overcome species barriers, at least many of us, if members of the other species are interested in this.","105,674 followers",Dave Consiglio,742,6.8K,91.6M,2017,https://www.quora.com/Will-technology-continue-to-evolve-until-humans-are-as-powerful-as-gods
10,Two ways this could go.First yes they would be like another race. You would have racist but most would be fine living with them.Secondly is no. If they had there own country or countries then we would most certainly go to war over ideology. We would believe different was to achieve prosperity. Just like the USSR and the USA had different beliefs and would fight to achieve it.,3 followers,Samuel Bateman,1.1K,102,56.4K,2017,https://www.quora.com/Will-technology-continue-to-evolve-until-humans-are-as-powerful-as-gods
