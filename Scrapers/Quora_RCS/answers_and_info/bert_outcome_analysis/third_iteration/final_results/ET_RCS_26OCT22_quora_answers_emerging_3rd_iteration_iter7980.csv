0,"Fusion reactor researchers passed the power break-even point quite a few years ago. The problem is that existing fusion reactors can’t do that for more than a very short time — a bit less than a second, if I recall correctly. Keeping the reaction going continues to be a sticking point to developing practical fusion power plants.",0 followers,John Holmes,826,1.2K,784.1K,2020,https://www.quora.com/How-long-do-fusion-reactors-run-for-each-time-the-fuse

2,"Let’s first define innovation, as it’s an overused term, in my opinion.As a lifelong student of invention and innovation, and someone who has spent a long time building hopefully innovative products and services, here’s my definition:> Innovation is combining new or existing inventions in a novel way and successfully taking it to market profitably.Note that I don’t consider mere invention to beLet’s first define innovation, as it’s an overused term, in my opinion.As a lifelong student of invention and innovation, and someone who has spent a long time building hopefully innovative products and services, here’s my definition:> Innovation is combining new or existing inventions in a novel way and successfully taking it to market profitably.Note that I don’t consider mere invention to be innovation. It’s important, but a better mousetrap on some schmo’s garage bench collecting dust is not innovation in my opinion. And note taking it to market successfully and profitably. I have a moderately high bar.So let’s look at various things China has done.They dominate the solar panel market globally, with Chinese owned firms holding 9 of the top 10 spots in terms of global market share. They have incrementally innovated solar panel manufacturing and supply chains to radically shift global energy markets.They are beginning to dominate wind turbine markets. Chinese owned firms hold 2–3 of the top five spots in global market share, and of course with China building more wind energy than the rest of the world combined, they are dominating the largest market for the technology.They dominate the global electric bus market. Their firms have 500,000 or so electric buses on the roads of China, at least a hundred times more electric buses than the rest of the world combined, and are starting to show up around the world as well.Chinese car firms jointly sell more electric light vehicles than every other manufacturer combined, with BYD selling more than Tesla recently, albeit including plug in hybrid electric vehicles. And know where electric car batteries are coming from? A ton of them are coming from China. Yeah, they are part of the global EV disrup...","20,087 followers",Ben Kolber,11.1K,324,21.6M,2020,https://www.quora.com/How-long-do-fusion-reactors-run-for-each-time-the-fuse

5,"A very simplistic answer would be mass.A star instigates ‘self-sustaining’ fusion via internal pressure by way of gravity. That mass generates gravity; that gravity generates pressure; that pressure, heat; heat eventually leads to plasma and then fusion.Utterly simplistic; but that’s the gist.Since we don’t have any spare solar masses laying about, we achieve this heat via magnetic confinement. So far, there is more energy going into the apparatus than is being produced.","220,640 followers",Franklin Veaux,1.6K,47.3K,783.1M,2019,https://www.quora.com/How-long-do-fusion-reactors-run-for-each-time-the-fuse
6,"Density and desired output.The reason the sun burns at a lower temperature is because the core is incredibly dense and held that way by gravitational confinement.

As the plasma is thinner, the potential hill the nuclei have to climb is higher and thus hotter. Additionally, we want tokamaks to produce megawatts - heck they need to in order to keep the confinement magnets powered, not tens of watts as an equivalent mass in the sun would produce, and thus fusion has to be much more common than in the core of the sun, hence higher temperatures. That makes it challenging to produce a burning plasma.",316 followers,Reko Hynönen,3.4K,109,1.2M,2019,https://www.quora.com/How-long-do-fusion-reactors-run-for-each-time-the-fuse

8,"Confinement. No problem with heating, but you’ve got to hold the plasma in a magnetic field (or inertially in laser fusion) long enough to produce more energy than was required to make it. This would be easy in classical physics, but the plasma, being charged, can make its own electric fields that allow it to escape via these “instabilities”. We now know how to quench these, somewhat.
