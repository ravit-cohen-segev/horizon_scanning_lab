The thing is we have to take a look at the innards of a country to really know whether or not you are truly developed. That Chinese are so obsessed with portraying the facade that they are technologically advanced and ahead is actually an indication that they have not fully developed yet. Because fully developed countries have no need to show off things like that. Everyone knows they are developed.For example, here is San Francisco:Look, not many skyscrapers right? And look at those old cable cars going around! That must mean they are undeveloped right? Nope. Everyone knows San Francisco is a developed city. That’s why it has no need to show off with luxury skyscrapers and such things.Or how about Florence, Italy?Again, no skyscrapers here. But everyone knows it’s a developed city and Italy is a developed country.My point is, you have got to look at the people and the innards of a country to truly know if they are developed.This is the true face of China:You have got to look at the average person. Does the average Chinese have good access to healthcare (which is ranked near the bottom in WHO rankings btw)? Can they drink tap water safely? Do they have access to quality food? Do all have access to electricity or paved roads or a quality education? The answer is: probably, yes, if you are living in the rich east coast provinces of Jiangsu or Zhejiang or Guangdong- but not if you are living in say - Xinjiang or Gansu or Tibet. China’s wealth is not spread equally, neither is it developed equally. Even though the CCP has developed China quite fast - there is still a lot of work to be done making sure *every Chinese* have equal access to everything.And then you got to look at the attitude of the people. When I was in China I found that you really got to look out for who you trust, because there is a lot of scams going on all the time. You never know what is real, what is fake, what is real price of anything. Why do these scams exist? Because people have to be desperate to make money that’s why.Why are people desperate to make money? Probably because they are not making enough to survive, which is an indication that the country is still developing. You’ll notice that in general, the more developed a country is, the less likely there will be scams. In Korea/Japan/Taiwan, you will not find very many scams. In China and Eastern Europe it’s likely.Another aside I want to note is that Chinese bathrooms don’t contain any toilet paper. Do you know the reason why? It’s because people steal it. Now, in what developed country does this happen? I can’t think of any. Only in a developing country would you need to bring your own toilet paper to the bathroom because there isn’t any there due to fear of people stealing it.I find GDP/capita to be generally a pretty good indicator of how developed a country is. The average GDP/capita (PPP) of China is still around $8k/person. While that is higher than most Asian countries - it’s still below the 4 East Asian tigers + Japan and far from the $62k/person that the USA has.The true measure of a developed society is to observe the people that live in the country and not the appearance of the country itself. Chinese “face” culture is the same. You can just obviously see that China has developed really really fast, and mentality wise people are still harping about luxury products and consumerism - this is where Americans were back in the 50s, 60s and 70s, not now.The biggest consumers of luxury products are Chinese people, not Americans or Europeans. The more developed you are, the less need you have to validate your self worth with materialism. The less desire you have to spend thousands of dollars on your children's schooling just to send them to be educated abroad. The less need to travel to countries like Canada or USA for giving birth so that your child becomes a US or Canadian citizen, or to launder your money by buying up real estate in other countries. Developed countries do not need to do things like that.Thats why you should always pay attention to the old adage -Edit:Of course, Chinese commenters love to bring up the USA. Yes, USA has lots of impoverished areas too; every country has developed areas and undeveloped areas, however my point is that for China there is significantly more undeveloped areas at a higher % compared to the USA. The poverty rate for China is 16% as of 2019 and for USA it is 1.5% as of 2019.

4,"The hallmarks of a developed country are quite difficult to define. What I most see being used is HDI and GDP per capita, which are good as a starting point, but even then where is the line? If it's ""very high human development"", there are places like Argentina and Belarus close or over that limit, but few people would consider these countries developed - usually because of high inequality, lack of stability, lack of economic diversity, and the like.The very concept of a developed nation today is very ""polluted"" by our standing examples (USA, EU, ANZAC, Japan-Singapore-South Korea), in the seThe hallmarks of a developed country are quite difficult to define.

If it's ""very high human development"", there are places like Argentina and Belarus close or over that limit, but few people would consider these countries developed - usually because of high inequality, lack of stability, lack of economic diversity, and the like.The very concept of a developed nation today is very ""polluted"" by our standing examples (USA, EU, ANZAC, Japan-Singapore-South Korea), in the sense that we assume that a developed country will be like one of those and have common features like democracy - which is a political system and unrelated to high levels of economic development, as places like the UAE constantly lay bare to our viewing pleasure.So just a disclaimer to mention how difficult it can be to call a place either developed or developing. We usually have good references at the extremes (ie. Scandinavia and Central Africa) but the middle ground is quite convoluted.I think living standards across the world will continue to rise. It should not be that long before the less developed nations attain a dignified level of development similar to what current developed nations had in the post-WWII era, in that they'll have access to similar comforts, technology and amenities.As for who could presumably advance the most, I would say Argentina+Brazil+Colombia, Russia (here's another issue, is a former superpower developed or developing?), Turkey and Malaysia. All of these countries have political stability, a recent history of steady growth (notwithstanding Brazil's and Russia's recent woes, the big picture is optimistic) and still-untapped shares of internal markets to fuel growth, achievable also through increases on households' disposable incomes. It might come down on their infrastructure improvement, access to foreign investment and educational reform to ensure higher wages and a better standard of living.China is almost a given, their efforts will depend on how wealth can reach the rural areas. So are Uruguay, Chile and Costa Rica, who are already almost there but need a push of economic diversifying and entrepreneurship. India is quite farther from it but given the pace of economic development, I can see it happening. Iran is another possibility if it could manage the Middle Eastern looming shadow of instability and clericalism.","113,622 followers",Anuradha Tiwari,4.2K,0,0,2016,https://www.quora.com/Why-does-unemployment-in-developing-countries-rise-as-new-and-emerging-technologies-develop
5,"When it comes to emotional and spiritual upliftment and rallying the community, and as treasured symbols of our roots, these people still have a purpose. But believe me, when it comes to anythWhen it comes to emotional and spiritual upliftment and rallying the community, and as treasured symbols of our roots, these people still have a purpose. But believe me, when it comes to anything beyond that, they have nothing useful to tell us.These people have no business telling us how to dress or what to eat, how to marry or divorce, or whether interest payments, adoption, or organ donation are “permissible,” OK?Oh what an extreme problem this is in our countries, and not just in the countries that your prejudice leads you to guess. Even a Jamaican told me that in her country, a doctor who takes the bus with poor people will acquire a bad reputation.How important is this?Israel encourages Palestinians and Arab Israelis to study vocational fields because (1) this prevents the formation of a credible intellectual revolutionary class and (2) it makes it easier for them to immigrate so they can be gotten rid of. Israel doesn't want more Edward Saids.The prelude event of the Armenian Genocide was for the Ottoman Empire to arrest almost 300 Armenian public intellectuals who lived in Constantinople and send most of them to their deaths.Shamefully I must say, Pakistan did the same to over a thousand Bangladeshi intellectuals in 1971.The first step to subjugating a people is to eliminate their thinkers.The few poor countries that became wealthy took some ideas from mainstream economics but also followed their own ideas, to the constant condemnation of the Western world. This applies to all the Asian Tigers and to China.Having taken a few courses on development economics, I can tell you that it's very complicated and nothing useful is yet known. The path of how a poor country can become advanced and wealthy is still a black hole for knowledge. Most likely it will be different and unique for each poor country.The World Bank and IMF are still running on garbage neo—liberalism which was not only discredited decades ago, but also was never based on real evidence in the first place. One thing is for sure, it very nicely serves the interests of Western capital.If we graduated 1/10th as many good academic economists as we do doctors, engineers and programmers who immigrate and never return, we would get somewhere.During the Cold War, the Soviet Union was subjected to the harshest sanctions. But neighbouring Communist countries like Romania, Albania, Bulgaria, etc., were treated more leniently — in order to drive a wedge between them and the USSR.After the Cold War, this stayed the same. The US is brutal with Russia, but kind to Kazakhstan. It's brutal with China, but kind to Mongolia. And so on.Stop wasting your breath on something imaginary.It's been 60—70 years since the era of decolonization. How do you think France and Britain are still among the top 10 economies? And the Netherlands 17th? It makes sense that they enriched themselves by owning continents, but how about now?Wake up. Their soldiers and administrators left our countries, but they're still ruling us more subtly.Who can understand how to keep us divided and exploit our divisions, better than the ones who invented our borders and statehood in the first place?It worked like a charm. Results, however absurd, are guaranteed. 70 years after the British gave their blessing to the breakup of India, India and Pakistan each spend X billion dollars to maintain vast forces on their borders in the Himalayas, where only yaks and snow leopards live.Who profits from this problem?We need to develop a unity of countries and peoples who are in the same position — poor, underdeveloped, historically colonized, and to this day politically subdued and frequently threatened by the West.Nobody told us this when we had to learn English.",26 followers,Balaji Viswanathan,829,5.6K,427.2M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Why-does-unemployment-in-developing-countries-rise-as-new-and-emerging-technologies-develop

Even in remote areas the government will provide satellite internet and charge the same price (subsidise). Theres many people living in remote Islands or distant place, that struggling even to have electricity, access to medical help, pay fair prices for food..and not allow monopolies to control everything.Indonesia is advancing towards being developed. But they will only become truly developed when ALL people are treated fairly and helped and given the same facilities and infrastructure, and not discriminated because of where they are born and raised. Obviously there some difficulty because Indonesia is an Island Nation, spread out over vast distance..It easy for Govt in Jakarta to forget about people living far away. The other problem is the complexity of government layers. Too many levels of Government, too much bureacracy, too many hands stealing money that has been allocated for infrastructure. They need to simplify the process of ensuring money allocated to infrastructure projects gets spent on those projects.Indonesia does a few things really well at federal level..eg education. Theres standardised schooling system across whole. Also National highways are generally maintained ok.

Sitting on the dock or being out on the lake are accessible to me and I take regular advantage. I leave my phone at the office sometimes so I'm not tempted.
