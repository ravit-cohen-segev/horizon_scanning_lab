Even the technology to resurrect the dead.There really is the lab, for resurrecting the dead.> The picture above is a test lab for corpse generation.A laboratory in China is working on a project to freeze human bodies that will later be used to resurrect people who have died. The Shandong Yinfeng Life Science Research is the first in this field, and the only cryonics research center in China. They offer services such as cryonic suspension which allows the human body to be preserved in freezing cold temperatures, revolutionizing organ transplantation, with the help of cryonics.Aaron Drake, director of the Yinfeng clinical response center, explains how the human heart only has six hours before it begins to die, after the death of its owner. But with cryonics, this time can be extended. Drake highlights another way their cryonics technology can literally freeze time to offer patients the care they need despite time constraints. He gave an example, people who have a heart attack or stroke can cool their bodies in a hypothermic environment to prevent tissue damage. Even soldiers who have amputated limbs can be frozen in a hypothermic environment to be taken to specialized medical facilities to be reassembled and not lose their limbs forever. There is no doubt that freezing vital organs and human tissues is preserved longer, giving people a chance to survive longer.About 25 years ago western technology underestimated Chinese IT technology by joking ""if you want to have junk, buy Chinese IT products"". Now the opposite has happened, in just 25 years China's IT technology has developed tremendously and has begun to dominate the world. Just imagine, when the world was still focused on 4G technology, Chinese IT companies had launched 5G technology-based devices, and it is even suspected that China's IT R&D is currently working on 6G and 7G-based technologies.The Chinese government began to act tough following the blacklisting of Huawei by the United States, making it difficult to buy components from there. Sources said China had summoned tech companies to discuss the rules. Beijing has announced it will release its own list of unreliable foreign companies. There is also a threat to limit exports of 'rare earth' metals which are so crucial to the US defense industry.In addition to Microsoft, other big tech companies that China calls up include Dell Technologies Inc, Samsung Electronics, SK Hynix Inc, as well as ARM. So far, several companies have claimed to comply with the US by severing business ties with Huawei. These include Google, which prohibits the full use of the Android, ARM and Facebook operating systems. However, Google later hoped that Huawei would not be penalized. The gist of Google's argument is that Huawei would be more dangerous if they were forced to use a modified or hybrid version of Android. According to Google, the modified version of Android is even more vulnerable to being hacked, not even by China. So, according to Google, it is better for Huawei to be allowed to use the Android OS as usual because its security is more guaranteed.Using 3D Printing Technology, China Will Be Able to Create Villages on the Moon or MarsOne of the first civilizations to make ceramics about ...",18 followers,Asim Qureshi,12.7K,996,156M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Which-country-has-the-most-advanced-technology-USA-China-Japan-or-Germany

This is unfairly set against the relatively low death rates of most of Mao’s rule, which he is never credited for.Acquiring technology is relatively easy. China under Mao got satellites and H-bombs.Applying the things to the whole society took longer, since China started out in 1949 as one of the poorest countries in the world, and with a fairly uneducated population.SeeIncidentally, Japan did the same things much faster. They were not flooded with opium, nor invaded by foreign armies before 1945, when they were already developed. They did have an efficient system of government, adapted from their traditional forms.
