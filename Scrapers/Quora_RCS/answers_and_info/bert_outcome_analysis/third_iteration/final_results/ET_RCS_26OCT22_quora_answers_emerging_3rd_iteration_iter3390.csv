Today's principle of nuclear fission reactor power generation is not fundamentally different from steam engines hundreds of years ago! Regardless of the current thermal power or nuclear power, it is heating water: heat converts water into steam, and the steam drives the turbine to generate electricity. (Note: The conversion rate of nuclear fission we use today is only 0.135%)It is most likely that human beings will not be able to ""go out"" the solar system, and even be ""trapped"" to die on earth!The nuclear fusion conversion rate is 0.7%. If nuclear fusion power generation is realized, it may alleviate the current energy crisis. It is not enough for interstellar flight. (Note: As science fiction says that ""Positive and Anti-Matter Annihilation"" is the most efficient, can achieve 100% quality conversion, can help us fly out of the solar system. )Realistically, if we fail to master the controllable nuclear fusion before depleting fossil energy, it is not only ""Civilization Retrogression,"" but the entire human sci and tech civilization will be ""locked out"" until we die. Because in those days we will be unable to ""organize higher-scale industrialization"" and not be able to further test our scientific theory.Human beings are powerless and insignificant. Think of Traveler 1, the man-made object farthest from the Earth, and the fastest man-made object. It takes 40,000 years to fly to the AC+79 3888 star of Ophiuchus. It takes 73,600 to fly to Proxima Centauri of Centaur. The interstellar voyage for it is just a simple fantastic lies. How negligible us? Please be humble~As for interstellar travel, if the person who does not wear the spacesuit leaves the surface layer, just like ""The deep sea fish leave the deep sea will detonate himself"", yes, in any other environment, the human body will be vulnerable to ""cannot withstand even a single blow"". Hey, we humans are the creatures born in the surface environment. We are destined to be inseparable from such environment, and it is even more difficult to cross the ""space measured by light years."" The earth is the cradle of humankind and it will surely be our destination and cemetery.Almost all of the Earthian is still bound by gravity, and it is difficult to fly out of it.Humans used to go to the moon with ""The primeval Chemical Rocket,"" but never went to Mars. Most people are trapped in the earth's tiny plot of land, let alone the universe.Although we can now ""observe dozens of billions of light years of the universe"", no matter how influential bigwigs can't leave the earth. They can only be like the common people who feet can't leave the ground. Exhausting the limits of the power of human tech can barely enough landing on the moon, its number can be counted on the fingers of one hand.The natural resources in the universe are inexhaustible, but we can only divide into some hostile factions, scheme against each other, intrigued, mutual suspicion, resorting to deception… excessive competition for such a little bit of unremarkable resource on earth. The human civilization at this stage is still too primitive.I really want to ""strive for the cause of human civilization in the universe all my lifetime"", but now I can only ""work for the sake of making a living and fortune"", such a life is not reconciled.We even have not been able to explore the earth.In terms of crustal exploration, the deepest borehole that our drilled has just reached more than 10,000 meters depth. Our drill bit with difficulty went to the bottom of the crust for humans and took a look at the edge of the mantle. This depth is only equivalent to ""The worm takes a bite of apple peel."" This is why we cannot predict earthquakes because even the ""normal state"" of the crust can only be inferred by indirect evidence, and the judgment of its ""abnormal state"" is even more unreliable.…SummaryIt seems that some of today inventions of ""redoubtable and formidable"" are mostly the advancement of Applied Science, not the progress of Basic Science. The development of personal computers is only consistently integrated and shrinking smaller, supercomputers are always stacking and piled up, naturally, their computing performance is strengthened…But quantitative change is unlikely to trigger a qualitative change. It won't bring us quantum computers.The so-called ""innovative tide and creative spoondrift"" is just something ""in application-level."" Basic theory has been stagnant for a long time, and superstring theory has not progressed for many years. In any case, ""Basic Theory"" is the ""source power"" of human sci and tech development. Tomorrow, we may have some room for growth in the application of tech, but the development of the ""fundamental power"" has not been reformed for a long time!Chier Hu's answer to Has fundamental physics stagnated?Chier Hu's answer to Do you think our technology is primitive?Chier Hu's answer to Why is medical technology so primitive compared to computer technology?Chier Hu's answer to What are some examples showing how underdeveloped or powerless present-day human technology is?",78 followers,Rajan Singh,1.5K,360,25.2M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Is-it-possible-that-humans-can-do-anything-they-think-in-the-future-with-advanced-technologies

When we filled that range some humans created new technologies of clothing, fire and shelter to extend their range. This expanded range is called the frontier. New resources are found in the frontier enriching all. In this environment cooperation is favoured over competition, since cooperation brings more resources from the frontier into the center enriching us all.In the present age our frontier is interplanetary space, and beyond that, interstellar space. Interplanetary space is traverse by chemical rockets. The first large chemical rockets were developed in the 1940s and advanced continuously since. Investment in rocket technology reduces the cost of momentum delivered by rockets. This increases the mass flow per dollar between points where the change in speed is fixed to connect the two places. Thus development follows a well defined arc;* small suborbital payloads — V2 rocket — 1945 — ICBM — converts the entire world into a battlefield, creating mutually assured destruction — bringing world peace and the end of global warfare.At this point serious investment in lowering the cost of momentum delivered by rockets was abandoned. Project funding for atomic rockets was ended, and previously declassified materials were reclassified. Had funding and focus continued apace we would have had* very large interplanetary payloads — Nuclear Pulse Rocket — 1981 — first flights to the planets — development of off world resources, first cities in space — end of poverty, the first post scarcity society.The founding of Space in 2002 resulted in a rocket with a reusable first stage. This dramatically cut the cost of space launch and allowed SpaceX to come to dominate space launch and earn significant profits doing so.* Falcon reusable chemical rocket — dominate space launchIt takes 52 days 16 hours to fly to Pluto at 1/10th gee using photonic thrusters.To perform interstellar trips requires vastly more energy. Yet, that energy is available from the Sun. The way we tap the sun’s energy at the scale needed is by creating an optical machine made of plasma. You see, the refractive index of hot plasmas changes with temperature. So, by projecting a pattern of laser light into the chromosphere to create an optical element that is capable of communicating, computing, generating controlled laser beams, and making copies of itself.

I think AI will kill jobs, and over time, AI might kill most “jobs” as we know them. I think that people are somewhat complacent in regard to the economic impact of AI, and will likely be ill-prepared for the changes we have to adapt to in the not-so-distant future.First, let's start with the comparisons to machinery and automation. They did indeed put factory workers out of work. In that respect, I agree AI today is similar in many applications, replacing workers who have less specialized skills, perhaps call center operators, office assistants (in a limited extent), and maybe soon, taxi drivers and truck drivers. But I would argue that AI is fundamentally different from machinery or most of the other analogies commonly made when answering this question, because AI is growing and is unlikely to stop growing. It's growing in breadth (of applications and industries), in geographic and economic scope, and in power (it's capacity to address increasingly complex tasks). A more fitting analogy would be machinery in an automobile plant that not only made the parts one day, but then learned how to assemble them the week after, and then how to design cars a year later.I think that there is little that is out of reach for advanced AI of the future. Let's leave the question of the AI singularity alone for now. Instead, I think that deep learning efforts at Google and elsewhere are making AI systems learn faster and faster, with a growing rate of acceleration. Advanced AI can now address increasingly complex tasks including medical diagnosis, stock market trading, weather prediction and human behavioral modeling. Very soon, it will be able to take the place of certain types of teachers, and find a role in education. It can already deal with complex systems in software and mathematics, and seems to be only limited in applications that require interactions with the physical world (sensors are still imperfect), and with people.So without projecting too far into the future, we can ask the question, what jobs will NOT be killed by AI? Jobs that involve labor are already (or soon to be) replaced. Jobs that require logical reasoning are being replaced, albeit at a slower rate. What are the qualities that humans have that cannot be captured by AI? Perhaps creativity, emotional responses? So perhaps researchers in academia will survive longer than most, and artists (though AI stylistic mimicry is already quite impressive and their results enjoyable), and counselors/psychologists/case workers, and decision makers like CEOs who cannot be predictable or error prone. And hopefully software engineers and algorithm designers who develop AI systems.This leaves a very, very small portion of today's jobs intact. Many say: we just need to train people to fill higher level jobs created by AI, e.g. Programmers, ML researchers. But this is no easy feat. The US educational system is struggling to meet the demands created by advanced technology today. This failure is in part responsible for the economic divide plaguing the country today. The challenge of educating the public for a job market that is both decreasing in scope and increasing in complexity, is nothing we've ever faced before.I am far from original in this opinion. But if I had to guess, I would say that AI will put far more people out of work than we can (re)train in time. That will have significant economic repercussions as corporations seeking to minimize cost will do so at the cost of rising unemployment. There will need to be dramatic changes in social policies in order to avert large scale economic disaster, first dramatic rises in minimum wage, then eventually some type of universal income/welfare. It's the kind of change that requires significant leadership in our government, something that seems woefully absent today.","5,360 followers",Valerio Cietto,677,2.4K,9.1M,2017,https://www.quora.com/Is-it-possible-that-humans-can-do-anything-they-think-in-the-future-with-advanced-technologies

I know that you do not expect an answer such as ""Oh, I did not know that there are children dying from hunger, but from now on I will desist from any kind of space research until mankind has solved that problem!"" In fact, I have known of famined children long before I knew that a voyage to the planet Mars is technically feasible. However, I believe, like many of my friends, that travelling to the Moon and eventually to Mars and to other planets is a venture which we should undertake now, and I even believe that this project, in the long run, will contribute more to the solution of these grave problems we are facing here on Earth than many other potential projects of help which are debated and discussed year after year, and which are so extremely slow in yielding tangible results.Before trying to describe in more detail how our space program is contributing to the solution of our Earthly problems, I would like to relate briefly a supposedly true story, which may help support the argument. About 400 years ago, there lived a count in a small town in Germany. He was one of the benign counts, and he gave a large part of his income to the poor in his town. This was much appreciated, because poverty was abundant during medieval times, and there were epidemics of the plague which ravaged the country frequently. One day, the count met a strange man. He had a workbench and little laboratory in his house, and he labored hard during the daytime so that he could afford a few hours every evening to work in his laboratory. He ground small lenses from pieces of glass; he mounted the lenses in tubes, and he used these gadgets to look at very small objects. The count was particularly fascinated by the tiny creatures that could be observed with the strong magnification, and which he had never seen before. He invited the man to move with his laboratory to the castle, to become a member of the count's household, and to devote henceforth all his time to the development and perfection of his optical gadgets as a special employee of the count.The townspeople, however, became angry when they realized that the count was wasting his money, as they thought, on a stunt without purpose. ""We are suffering from this plague,"" they said, ""while he is paying that man for a useless hobby!"" But the count remained firm. ""I give you as much as I can afford,"" he said, ""but I will also support this man and his work, because I know that someday something will come out of it!""Indeed, something very good came out of this work, and also out of similar work done by others at other places: the microscope. It is well known that the microscope has contributed more than any other invention to the progress of medicine, and that the elimination of the plague and many other contagious diseases from most parts of the world is largely a result of studies which the microscope made possible.The count, by retaining some of his spending money for research and discovery, contributed far more to the relief of human suffering than he could have contributed by giving all he could possibly spare to his plague-ridden community.The situation which we are facing today is similar in many respects. The President of the United States is spending about 200 billion dollars in his yearly budget. This money goes to health, education, welfare, urban renewal, highways, transportation, foreign aid, defense, conservation, science, agriculture and many installations inside and outside the country. About 1.6 percent of this national budget was allocated to space exploration this year. The space program includes Project Apollo, and many other smaller projects in space physics, space astronomy, space biology, planetary projects, Earth resources projects, and space engineering. To make this expenditure for the space program possible, the average American taxpayer with 10,000 dollars income per year is paying about 30 tax dollars for space. The rest of his income, 9,970 dollars, remains for his subsistence, his recreation, his savings, his other taxes, and all his other expenditures.You will probably ask now: ""Why don't you take 5 or 3 or 1 dollar out of the 30 space dollars which the average American taxpayer is paying, and send these dollars to the hungry children?"" To answer this question, I have to explain briefly how the economy of this country works. The situation is very similar in other countries. The government consists of a number of departments (Interior, Justice, Health, Education and Welfare, Transportation, Defense, and others) and the bureaus (National Science Foundation, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and others). All of them prepare their yearly budgets according to their assigned missions, and each of them must defend its budget against extremely severe screening by congressional committees, and against heavy pressure for economy from the Bureau of the Budget and the President. When the funds are finally appropriated by Congress, they can be spent only for the line items specified and approved in the budget.The budget of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, naturally, can contain only items directly related to aeronautics and space. If this budget were not approved by Congress, the funds proposed for it would not be available for something else; they would simply not be levied from the taxpayer, unless one of the other budgets had obtained approval for a specific increase which would then absorb the funds not spent for space. You realize from this brief discourse that support for hungry children, or rather a support in addition to what the United States is already contributing to this very worthy cause in the form of foreign aid, can be obtained only if the appropriate department submits a budget line item for this purpose, and if this line item is then approved by Congress.You may ask now whether I personally would be in favor of such a move by our government. My answer is an emphatic yes. Indeed, I would not mind at all if my annual taxes were increased by a number of dollars for the purpose of feeding hungry children, wherever they may live.I know that all of my friends feel the same way. However, we could not bring such a program to life merely by desisting from making plans for voyages to Mars. On the contrary, I even believe that by working for the space program I can make some contribution to the relief and eventual solution of such grave problems as poverty and hunger on Earth. Basic to the hunger problem are two functions: the production of food and the distribution of food. Food production by agriculture, cattle ranching, ocean fishing and other large-scale operations is efficient in some parts of the world, but drastically deficient in many others. For example, large areas of land could be utilized far better if efficient methods of watershed control, fertilizer use, weather forecasting, fertility assessment, plantation programming, field selection, planting habits, timing of cultivation, crop survey and harvest planning were applied.The best tool for the improvement of all these functions, undoubtedly, is the artificial Earth satellite. Circling the globe at a high altitude, it can screen wide areas of land within a short time; it can observe and measure a large variety of factors indicating the status and condition of crops, soil, droughts, rainfall, snow cover, etc., and it can radio this information to ground stations for appropriate use. It has been estimated that even a modest system of Earth satellites equipped with Earth resources, sensors, working within a program for worldwide agricultural improvements, will increase the yearly crops by an equivalent of many billions of dollars.The distribution of the food to the needy is a completely different problem. The question is not so much one of shipping volume, it is one of international cooperation. The ruler of a small nation may feel very uneasy about the prospect of having large quantities of food shipped into his country by a large nation, simply because he fears that along with the food there may also be an import of influence and foreign power. Efficient relief from hunger, I am afraid, will not come before the boundaries between nations have become less divisive than they are today. I do not believe that space flight will accomplish this miracle over night. However, the space program is certainly among the most promising and powerful agents working in this direction.Let me only remind you of the recent near-tragedy of Apollo 13. When the time of the crucial reentry of the astronauts approached, the Soviet Union discontinued all Russian radio transmissions in the frequency bands used by the Apollo Project in order to avoid any possible interference, and Russian ships stationed themselves in the Pacific and the Atlantic Oceans in case an emergency rescue would become necessary. Had the astronaut capsule touched down near a Russian ship, the Russians would undoubtedly have expended as much care and effort in their rescue as if Russian cosmonauts had returned from a space trip. If Russian space travelers should ever be in a similar emergency situation, Americans would do the same without any doubt.Higher food production through survey and assessment from orbit, and better food distribution through improved international relations, are only two examples of how profoundly the space program will impact life on Earth. I would like to quote two other examples: stimulation of technological development, and generation of scientific knowledge.The requirements for high precision and for extreme reliability which must be imposed upon the components of a moon-travelling spacecraft are entirely unprecedented in the history of engineering. The development of systems which meet these severe requirements has provided us a unique opportunity to find new material and methods, to invent better technical systems, to manufacturing procedures, to lengthen the lifetimes of instruments, and even to discover new laws of nature.All this newly acquired technical knowledge is also available for application to Earth-bound technologies. Every year, about a thousand technical innovations generated in the space program find their ways into our Earthly technology where they lead to better kitchen appliances and farm equipment, better sewing machines and radios, better ships and airplanes, better weather forecasting and storm warning, better communications, better medical instruments, better utensils and tools for everyday life. Presumably, you will ask now why we must develop first a life support system for our moon-travelling astronauts, before we can build a remote-reading sensor system for heart patients. The answer is simple: significant progress in the solutions of technical problems is frequently made not by a direct approach, but by first setting a goal of high challenge which offers a strong motivation for innovative work, which fires the imagination and spurs men to expend their best efforts, and which acts as a catalyst by including chains of other reactions.Spaceflight without any doubt is playing exactly this role. The voyage to Mars will certainly not be a direct source of food for the hungry. However, it will lead to so many new technologies and capabilities that the spin-offs from this project alone will be worth many times the cost of its implementation.Besides the need for new technologies, there is a continuing great need for new basic knowledge in the sciences if we wish to improve the conditions of human life on Earth. We need more knowledge in physics and chemistry, in biology and physiology, and very particularly in medicine to cope with all these problems which threaten man's life: hunger, disease, contamination of food and water, pollution of the environment.We need more young men and women who choose science as a career and we need better support for those scientists who have the talent and the determination to engage in fruitful research work. Challenging research objectives must be available, and sufficient support for research projects must be provided. Again, the space program with its wonderful opportunities to engage in truly magnificent research studies of moons and planets, of physics and astronomy, of biology and medicine is an almost ideal catalyst which induces the reaction between the motivation for scientific work, opportunities to observe exciting phenomena of nature, and material support needed to carry out the research effort.Among all the activities which are directed, controlled, and funded by the American government, the space program is certainly the most visible and probably the most debated activity, although it consumes only 1.6 percent of the total national budget, and 3 per mille (less than one-third of 1 percent) of the gross national product. As a stimulant and catalyst for the development of new technologies, and for research in the basic sciences, it is unparalleled by any other activity. In this respect, we may even say that the space program is taking over a function which for three or four thousand years has been the sad prerogative of wars.How much human suffering can be avoided if nations, instead of competing with their bomb-dropping fleets of airplanes and rockets, compete with their moon-travelling space ships! This competition is full of promise for brilliant victories, but it leaves no room for the bitter fate of the vanquished, which breeds nothing but revenge and new wars.Although our space program seems to lead us away from our Earth and out toward the moon, the sun, the planets, and the stars, I believe that none of these celestial objects will find as much attention and study by space scientists as our Earth. It will become a better Earth, not only because of all the new technological and scientific knowledge which we will apply to the betterment of life, but also because we are developing a far deeper appreciation of our Earth, of life, and of man.The photograph which I enclose with this letter shows a view of our Earth as seen from Apollo 8 when it orbited the moon at Christmas, 1968. Of all the many wonderful results of the space program so far, this picture may be the most important one. It opened our eyes to the fact that our Earth is a beautiful and most precious island in an unlimited void, and that there is no other place for us to live but the thin surface layer of our planet, bordered by the bleak nothingness of space. Never before did so many people recognize how limited our Earth really is, and how perilous it would be to tamper with its ecological balance. Ever since this picture was first published, voices have become louder and louder warning of the grave problems that confront man in our times: pollution, hunger, poverty, urban living, food production, water control, overpopulation. It is certainly not by accident that we begin to see the tremendous tasks waiting for us at a time when the young space age has provided us the first good look at our own planet.Very fortunately though, the space age not only holds out a mirror in which we can see ourselves, it also provides us with the technologies, the challenge, the motivation, and even with the optimism to attack these tasks with confidence. What we learn in our space program, I believe, is fully supporting what Albert Schweitzer had in mind when he said: ""I am looking at the future with concern, but with good hope.""My very best wishes will always be with you, and with your children.Very sincerely yours,Ernst StuhlingerAssociate Director for Science",UNKNOWN,Robert Frost,1.7K,9.4K,195.6M,2012,https://www.quora.com/Is-it-possible-that-humans-can-do-anything-they-think-in-the-future-with-advanced-technologies

How to change the news?How to play a master-stroke to change this narrative?Okay. Here are some clues.Remember surgical strikes after Uri attack? Opposition demanded proof.And, airstrikes at Balakot after Pulwama attack? Opposition wanted proof.Now, the DRDO has conducted the Anti-Satellite (ASAT) missile test which successfully destroyed a satellite. This news has to be disseminated to the Indians ( and to the world in a correct way through an appropriate authority in India so that it is not misunderstood by the world).Moreover, if PM Modi himself announces this news of Anti-Satellite (ASAT) missile destroying a satellite, don’t you think the opposition would demand proof?No, this time, the opposition did not demand proof. But, there were other loud protests. Some said credit of ASAT missile should go to first PM Jawaharlal Nehru. Some said ASAT missile project was started by UPA government in 2010. But, the former DRDO chief Dr. V.K. Sawaswat said UPA did not give clearance of ASAT missile experiment in 2012. Opposition made noise to ensure that credit for this ASAT missile test does not go to the government.Further, most opposition parties are seeking explanation as to why PM Modi made the announcement of ASAT missile when the model code of conduct was already in existence for the general elections of 2019?Isn’t your present question on Quora too aimed in the same direction? Why Modi declared it himself?Further, there are stories in media that when people came to know that Modi would be addressing the nation, people were anxious or curious. What would he announce? Another demonetisation? Another surgical strike on Pakistan? Arrest of Dawood? Elimination of Masood Azhar? Postponement or cancellation of the general elections?Look at the difference that a brand ambassador can make to an event. People like spicy food.How many persons would have come to know of the ASAT missile experiment if this announcement was made by DRDO chief to media, instead of PM Modi doing it himself?So, now the narrative has changed. Rahul Gandhi’s announcement of ₹ 72,000 per year to 20% poor persons has moved to sidelines. At least for some days. [Don’t worry Modi will have something else up his sleeves within next few days.]Everybody is discussing Modi’s announcement of ASAT missile now. India is now the 4th country in the world to achieve this feature.Last but not the least. And, this is the icing on the cake.So, the unnecessary cacophony of the opposition (which will harm opposition itself) over Modi’s announcement has ensured that India’s achievement in ASAT missile technology gets at least 10 times more publicity than a simple announcement by Modi (i.e., if it was not criticised by opposition), and at least 100 times more publicity than if the announcement was made by DRDO.It is a psychological warfare, my friend. During election period.Elections are contested not merely on ground, but also in the minds.Rahul Gandhi, Mamata Banerjee, and other opposition leaders are not able to match up with Modi’s ways of fighting the elections. They always fall prey to Modi’s movements. They need to hire services of some competent strategist.Do you understand the strategy behind Modi’s announcement of ASAT missile test now?Everything is fair in love and war and election (if it does not fall foul of the model code of conduct in the case of election).",5 followers,Achal Gautam,25K,3.7K,33.5M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Is-it-possible-that-humans-can-do-anything-they-think-in-the-future-with-advanced-technologies

But this time its different.And what was our Prime Minister doing in the middle of this, addressing rallies, endorsing Kumbh mela and other super-spreader events.Yes,the opposition was doing it too .But being a statesman, wasn’t his responsibility towards his other countrymen instead of concentrating solely on Bengal. What is the worst that could have happened if he had not addressed rallies in TN,WB or Assam, he would have lost the election.But he would have provided us with confidence in his leadership.The sad fact doesn’t end here.The BJP leaders have become so haughty in their ways that they neither respect other dignitaries but threaten the very voters who elected them with open arms and hearts.When an ex-Prime Minister provided the government with his suggestions, what does our health minister do .He mocked him on national television and then went on to endorse coronil and got busy on photo-ops. Wouldn’t it have been more gracious of him to acknowledge the suggestion.When a hapless citizen begged a Union Minister Prahlad Patel for oxygen for his ailing mother, the minister instead of empathizing with the citizen threatened to slap him as he was not speaking to the minister in a respectful tone.When there’s an extreme shortage of vaccines for senior citizens,the nephew of Devendra Fadnavis is getting the same vaccine in Nagpur.How callous and haugthy could the BJP leaders and their cronies get.When the pandemic ebbed a little towards the end of last year ,the BJP government instead of concentrating on increasing our health infrastructure or increasing the number of ICU ventilators or setting up new hospitals got busy on implementing farm laws,putting farmers in jail,selling banks,insurance ,railways etc.In a year, when people lost their jobs ,migrant laborers had to walk thousands of kilometers to reach their homes, the Ambanis and Adanis went on to add billions of dollars to their already burgeoning wealth.This has to end.We need to question those in power.But we can’t as the Prime Minister is never there to address our questions.The PM instead of addressing this grave situation was talking about the breed of dogs he loves in his last ‘Mann Ki Baat’.BJP might be very good in alot of things,but it has completely failed our nation in tackling this pandemic.And now passing the buck to state governments which are already inept and incompatible ,only agitates us and not placate us.We as citizens have every right to feel angry, to feel helpless, I get the feeling because I went through the same just a few days back.We are tired.We are tired not only of the pandemic, but also of empty rhetorics,empty promises and shenanigans.","1,523 followers",Rodra Hascaryo,2.1K,1.2K,13.4M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Is-it-possible-that-humans-can-do-anything-they-think-in-the-future-with-advanced-technologies

Although he never asked me to support any party or discussed anything related to politics with me, I became a congress supporter as I grew up seeing congress party flags, banners and what not.I started my B.Tech in NIT Surat in 2011 and Narendra Modi was the CM of Gujarat then, I was a congress supporter then. But I was slowly getting interested in Modi’s policies and the way he was ruling Gujarat as a model state. AP bifurcation and Rahul Gandhi’s rise in congress are final nails in the coffin for Congress, I will never support them again for what they have done and also partly due to the positive work being done by Modi.Now I support Narendra Modi (I’m not a BJP supporter ) for what he is trying to do. I agree demonetization wasn't executed properly but atleast he tried to do something and I don't think it is easy to pull off a success with Demonetization in a country where secrecy of information is very hard to achieve.Make in India is a great initiative, people claim it didn't produce the expected results, but I see our country going in the right direction as we didn't hear anything like Coal Scam or 2G scam in this govt yet and I hope we will not be talking about scams in near future as Modi is anything but a corrupt person.Why do people ask if Modi is good or bad ? Has he done anything that a Prime Minister shouldn't do ? Like being a silent spectator of Sonia’s rule ( as Manmohan did) or letting Pakistan initiate riots in Kashmir ?Congress is trying too hard to project Modi as a bad one as they could come to power only by ruining Modi, there is no other way to breach the Fort that he and Amit Shah has built for BJP.People talking about intolerance are the ones that cry when terrorists are encountered. People think Hindutva is the main agenda of BJP but atleast for now, developing India is their main agenda.Don't worry about secularism in India, people like Owaisi who talk about secularism while heading a party with a religion in its name (MIM) aren't the ones to ensure secularism in India, we as citizens of India will take care of that and we do have Judiciary and Election commission to support us.",8 followers,Dungar Chouhan,574,0,0,2017,https://www.quora.com/Why-India-has-not-developed-an-indigenous-Astronaut-programme-while-it-is-having-advanced-technology-with-regard-space-exploration
30,"Too soon to say. He has to compete with the likes of Nehru, Rao and Vajpayee. Nehru brought India together as a nation from the bits and pieces that the British left behind. After the death of Gandhi and Patel it was all on his shoulders to lead this new republic to success and build a global name for it.Rao brought India from a near bankruptcy and heralded a new era of growth and prosperity whose effects we can see to this day.Vajpayee brought India to the nuclear club, built the great highways, rebuilt the relations with the west and restarted the economic engine that had broken by the end oToo soon to say.

Many of these are works in progress [such as GST and IBC, both of which need further reforms] or have not worked to the full potential [ending Planning Commission to bring minimum government, is not fully seen in reality as Niti Ayog is bloated too].Each of the 4 PMs had their list of faults, but they also enabled landmark successes.

31,Don't expose your strength to others. Then they will be alerted and try to invent/ purchase the suitable equipment to handle our advanced technology. But unfortunately our primeminster unnecessarily opening mouth and make the Indian people and the other country to live with tension and fear of war.

32,"Because he’s the prime minister. Duh. What else do you expect?Every single prime minister before him as addressed the nation during such milestones.Just like Indira Gandhi did in 1974 (Operation Smiling Buddha).Just like Shri A.B. Vajpayee did in 1998 (Pokhran II).Whether or not it was a political move has nothing to do with him announcing the success of the project.He hasn’t broken any code of conduct. Modi never said that BJP made this possible, nor has he mentioned anything about INC’s failure in executing the project. People accussing him of that are seriously making a laughing stock out oBecause he’s the prime minister. Duh.

People accussing him of that are seriously making a laughing stock out of themselves and showing a severe case of cognitive dissonance.He has categorically mentioned that all credit of Mission Shakti’s success goes to the engineers and scientists from DRDO.Some people are arguing why did the individual scientists from DRDO not come out to address the country. To understand my explaination, please go through the link below:India’s Nuclear Scientists Have Been Dying Mysteriously And No One Knows WhyEver since our successful nuclearization, nuclear scientists working for BARC, NPCIL and DRDO have been assassinated by international intelligence agencies.Since this project is also of equal significance, I’d say their lives are at an equivalent threat. And hence, it’s best if they don’t come into limelight so soon.That’s about it, there’s nothing overtly political about this. So chill. It’s not like Modi is giving himself a Bharat Ratna for this (wink wink ;D).",156 followers,Jahnvi Sharma,2.2K,176,807.7K,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-advanced-technology-and-safety-features-of-the-new-anti-missile-aircraft-for-PM-Narendra-Modi
