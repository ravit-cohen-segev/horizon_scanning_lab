Germany is not the most technologically advanced country. It could be pretty close, but there are major elements of society who dedicate themselves to making sure that Germany uses inferior technology that kills more people, damages the environment more, costs more money, and will cause the total collapse of Earth’s biosphere due to a runaway greenhouse effect. Mostly in the Green Party. Because radiation from nuclear accidents is apparently scarier than way more people dying of regular pollution constantly and the total annihilation of all life on Earth as the oceans boil away.","5,360 followers",Valerio Cietto,677,2.4K,9.1M,2021,https://www.quora.com/How-was-Gommateshwara-statue-built-out-of-one-solid-rock-when-historians-claim-there-was-no-advanced-technology-back-then
