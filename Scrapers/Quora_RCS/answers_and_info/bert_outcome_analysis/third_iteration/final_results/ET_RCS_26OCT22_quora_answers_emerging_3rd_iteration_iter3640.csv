Everyone is dumb in 40k and that’s on purpose.Except the Tau.The Tau are still dumb in some areas, make no mistake. But they appear to have been among the first races which got the more serious treatment that Games Workshop is slowly converting 40k into in order to make it more main stream and easier to accept by the masses. The Tau no longer resemble their initial entry into the franchise (though the Tyranids could be argued to be contenders on seeing the most change I think).The Tau advertise themselves on being a thinking man’s faction. They don’t do stupid shit except in the very few instances where the Imperium does well against them and even then I wonder if the Imperium was actually fighting automated tanks and the like.The Tau use modern tactics and modern thinking of not having front lines, but rather war zones where mobile teams are more interested in completing objectives, taking out key targets, disrupting enemy logistics, etc.. The kind of thinking that we saw transform how warfare was fought when we shifted from WW1 to WW2 and then on to modern wars.By the time the Imperium realizes it needs to take them seriously.. it’s too late. The Tau are prepared, and the Taros Campaign ends in tragedy for the Imperium, seeing ten thousand Imperial Guard dead, thousands more wounded and again so captured. To have lost so many, to have killed so few, and to have gained literally nothing.. the Imperium was thoroughly embarrassed, and this was all just one fight over a single planet. Even with the Tau’s vastly inferior territory size and population, the differences were clear. The Imperium would need to dedicate such a bulk of their forces to any dedicated campaign that unless they could catch the Tau with their pants down there was no way they could muster that kind of force while dealing with the rest of the galaxy’s threats as well. And given the Tau so rarely expand, and when they do they take so little from the Imperium, it means they never dedicate the kind of forces they really need to in order to defeat the Tau when they do play on the defensive.In fact, right now it looks like they aren’t even going to send anyone to try to stop the current expansion at all, sadly. There’s also a time-lost crusade trapped in Tau space and it doesn’t look like they’re going to send them any help either.The Imperium just doesn’t want to deal with the Tau because their tactics and strategies make them so incredibly annoying to deal with and right now the entire galaxy is ripped in half by a warp storm that I think is just constantly vomiting out demons.So there’s your issue. The Imperium is technologically stagnated and tactically and strategically trapped in the 1910’s. The Tau are innovating constantly, and will experiment with new ideas to find novel solutions to easily take down normally serious threats like Imperium Titans. They focus on protecting their lives rather than protecting their territory, and will abandon a point of territory at the drop of a hat so as to tactically reposition, regroup, and then counter strike while you’re vulnerable. If at any point in time you stop to hold your ground instead of pressing aggressively against them, you lose, because you gave them the rest they needed to recollect, and now you’re sitting in a zone they know like the back of their hand. It’s just not feasible for the Imperium to see serious or long standing victories over the Tau as they’re the perfect thematic counter.",40 followers,Stephen James Hand,561,0,0,2022,https://www.quora.com/If-its-true-that-any-sufficiently-advanced-technology-is-indistinguishable-from-magic-why-can-t-the-resurrection-of-Jesus-Christ-be-explained-by-some-advanced-medical-technology-invented-by-the-Romans-that-was-kept

It is not a question of can you win, but a question of how many can you take out before you are defeated.Imagine if the Imperium used this practice on a grand scale. Not necessarily pull back entirely, but pull back so that that quintessential “there is less than one Space Marine for every world in the Imperium” phrase becomes “there is a hundred Astartes for everyIf the Imperium would pull back and secure their hometowns they would not only give themselves room to breathe but rebuild their defenses, rebuild war materials, and recruit and train better soldiers.Imagine all the might of the Imperium defending and not attacking. Let’s start with just twenty years…Two entire generations of Astartes geneseed could be harvested. TWO! Say there are a million right now. Each with two progenoids. After ten years they implant into new recruits and send the majority of the vets out to start spreading the Imperium’s reign once more. Not far, just another system or two.After those two million new recruits have been training, defending, and maybe some attacking in their general neighborhoods for another decade you pull out their progenoids and send them out to reinforce the first group.Now you have four million recruits training, defending, and attacking in their general neighborhoods and three million full Astartes taking the fight to the enemy once again… in just two decades! That’s not even a single generation!And sure, some planets will ultimately go to hell from this, but in my opinion it is no better to arrive at a battlezone after the planet has been completely overrun and you must resort to exterminatus because you are spread so thin on too many battlefields to protect them all…EDIT: I did this math for a comment below and thought it was pretty impressive to actually see so I wanted to add it above here as well. Basically it becomes a double plus 1 formula:Decade 1: 10k planets and 1 million Astartes.Decade 2: 20k planets and 3 million Astartes.Decade 3: 30k planets and 7 million Astartes.Decade 4: 70k planets and 15 million Astartes.Decade 5: 150k planets and 31 million Astartes.Decade 6: 310k planets and 63 million Astartes.Decade 7: 630k planets and 127 million Astartes.Decade 8: 1M+ planets and 255 million Astartes.FOR TEN THOUSAND YEARS the Imperium has been stagnant… I fixed it in less than a century… In 80 years the Imperium has expanded back to beyond its original size and its protection force (including only Astartes, not even Guard/Mechanicum/PDFs/etc.) has obviously risen exponentially…",1 follower,Mark Stamp,663,3.2K,24.9M,2019,https://www.quora.com/In-Warhammer-40k-why-did-the-Imperium-lose-to-the-Tau-Empire-despite-having-more-advanced-technology-space-marines-tanks-etc

In fact, the manufacture and maintenance of this tech is now bound up in religious rituals, some parts of the ritual are essential steps in the process, some are just pointless nonsense, but the Ad Mech priests believe it’s all required.Even worse, culturally, the Imperium and Ad Mech are now suspicious of original scientific and technological research. They believe that humanity achieved technological perfection in the distant past, and the key to advancement is recovering this knowledge, not making new discoveries and advancements. They think original research will lead to heretical and ‘abominable’ technologies. So it is unlikely that they will ever recover the scientific and technical understanding required to advance their current tech.The T’au are a forward looking species that fully understand their own tech, so have none of these problems.Also, the T’au are much more willing to cooperate with other Xenos species and learn from them to accelerate their scientific and technical advancements, whereas in the xenophobic Imperium, even looking too closely at Xenos technology will bring the Inquisition to your door.Basically the T’au are advancing quickly by grimdark standards because they are acting in a way that real 21st century humans would consider normal.

Scientific, mathematic, physical and technological. It was developed so that any potential seed colony could produce tanks and laser guns pretty much within weeks of making planetfall using what resources they could find. You ask for a plan, it gives you holographic blueprints, instructions easy enough for anyone to understand and a list of materials adapted so anyone one could make them from anything. None of that faffing around with finding and attaching a team of experts to every mission or probing the planet for rare materials. It probably explains how tanks in 40K can run on petrol, hydrogen, cooking oil or even frickingIt’s quite likely that human colonies could have been made up of ordinary people, you me, your cousin Dilbert, who made planetfall and with this wonder-library created a prosperous town with no one more an expert than what you can find in your typical Midwestern small town.It was colonial expansion for dummies!Some lucky planets settled with plans for mecha that could cut down trees and scare away big predators. How to build and run one was mostly important to the people who used it.There was a degree of variation though. Most devices were carried by colonists. The need to build a 5km long battleship or a neutron star mining drill was probably not very high on most colonists’ agendas so a lot of STCs sent out would have had more practical plans like looms, shelters, power tools and maybe the odd nuclear reactor.As you can imagine, after a while populations became rather reliant on the knowledge stored inside these devices since all the experts were probably chilling in the core worlds. Then the Warp kind of got messed up, we don’t know the details entirely but everything went haywire, the robots killed a whole lot of people and most importantly there has yet to be found any STC containing anything more than a few files. The STCs are at risk of Warp corruption - they have AI like the Men of Iron and there are thousands on Mars that no one wants to touch because those that didn’t horribly glitch were defiled by Warp magic so whatThere's even been one STC fragment found that started spitting outThe largely-corrupted but not Warp-ruined devices are called STC ‘fragments’ since only a tiny part of their archives survive. Since the colonies had come to rely on the information inside these devices for pretty much anything, it meant that a lot of places had to almost start from scratch. Best explanation we have for how humanity in some places were reduced to stone age populations is that small colonies that arrived with an STC holding rudimentary knowledge. When these devices played up or failed during the Age of Strife, no one planetside would have known how to even build a wooden crane without instructions and everyone went back to stone tools and mud huts due to a lack of expertise.The Age of Strife was something like 7000 years. Some planets got around the failing of their STCs by recoding important things from their dying advisors. Others didn’t have such foresight. Earth on the other hand was something like a parody of a quote often attributed to Einstein:“I don’t know what World War 3 will be fought with, but I know World War 4 will be fought with sticks and stones”If The Collapse due to being cut off from the rest of humanity was World War 3.

He who tries to be strong everywhere, will be strong nowhere.At the same time, though, the t’au finally gained some comprehension of what they were really up against. They were shocked to learn that a planetary population of ten billion or more isn’t even considered particularly big by Imperial standards, and that the fleet and army that had to stop shooting at them to go swat tyranids was a drop in the bucket compared to the true size of the Astra Militarum and Adeptus Astartes. So the t’au know they simply can’t afford to antagonize the Imperium overmuch, or else the High Lords of Terra might just take the risk of a second Damocles Gulf Crusade.Properly handled, the t’au are actually kind of useful to have around. The Imperium is stretched thin, and getting stretched thinner with every year that passes. And unless you’ve got a hardline Puritan inquisitor breathing down your neck, you can actually talk to the t’au and negotiate with them in good faith. Even Craftworld eldar aren’t as reasonable: if the farseer thinks that the death of an entire Imperial hive world will save one eldar life millennia from now, they’ll go for that before working with you. So the Astra Militarum for the Damocles Gulf region has found that, while keeping the t’au from seducing their youth is annoying, the t’au also give the local ork and ‘nid populations an additional enemy to worry about.

That isn’t possible of course, but if it were, you are right that there wouldn’t be an economy anymore, but why would we need one? Everything you could ever want is just instantly provided for you. The problem in that world is not economic collapse but how to not turn into the Eloi from The Time Machine or the fat people on scooters from the space ship in Wall-E.

16,"Robots are just the latest version of the automation that’s been going on for centuries.Cast your mind back 70 years, to the early days of the backhoe, and imagine being asked “How can ditch diggers prevent backhoes from outcompeting them and forcing them into poverty?” What would you say?One choice would be to tax the backhoes, and all the other technologies that automated work and destroyed jobs.

Of course, taxing them would slow their growth, but eventually the backhoes will win. One backhoe can do the work of dozens of men, maybe hundreds, in a fraction of the time. Maybe you could slow them for a few years, but those ditch diggers are still going to lose their jobs.Or we could take a more direct approach, the Luddite approach: outlaw backhoes, and all the other automation technologies. That would save the jobs. Those men, or actually their children and grandchildren would still be digging ditches today. We would all be living with the technologies, and the standard of living, of 70 years ago. We would be impoverished compared to today.So what about another approach: education? Just accept that automation is going to eliminate jobs, but if the people who lose their jobs are able to train for another, better job, everyone is better off. Unfortunately, that isn’t necessarily what happens. Some of the people who lost their ditch-digging jobs probably got jobs as backhoe operators, and no doubt others got jobs in other trades. But inevitably some people who have lost their jobs never find another job.When the pace of automation runs too fast, people whose jobs are automated away and are able to retrain for another job eventually see their new job automated away. In 1950, “computer” was not commonly used as the name for a device, but was the name of the job of carrying out mathematical computations (So now back to robots, and also AI. Workers really can’t prevent robots and AI from taking their jobs. In fact, automation of jobs is good because it means more goods and services get produced with less work. This makes society better off. Unfortunately, that doesn’t mean it makes everyone better off: it makes a few people much better off, and most people a bit better off, and some people much worse off.So rather than trying to hold back the tide, or to freeze society in a relatively impoverished state, we should be trying to help the people negatively impacted by automation by retraining them if possible, and by sharing with them some of the benefits from those who benefit most from it. This will become increasingly important as the pace of automation rises, and more and more people are negatively impacted.","135,500 followers",Hector Quintanilla,3.1K,1.2K,88.5M,2020,https://www.quora.com/In-Warhammer-40k-why-did-the-Imperium-lose-to-the-Tau-Empire-despite-having-more-advanced-technology-space-marines-tanks-etc

A pizza has about 75% of its cost in labour in various ways, delivery, taking your order, making it, cleaning the kitchen, etc.I’m guessing 1/3 of the labour is delivery, 25% of the cost of your pizza.So let’s imagine a delivery robot reduces that to 5%.It’s not zero and that’s an important point,SCenturies.

Those who believe automation will kill all jobs believe that will go in profit to companies and in the short term they are right. But anyone can buy a delivery robot so soon everyone will have one.So one pizza chain decides to get market share by cutting prices by 15%. it sells aSo pizza prices go down across the board.So we eat more pizza and here we hit a key point in economics calledFor many things a drop in price of X% causes demand to go up by more than X% and that is certainly true of pizzas. This means that there will be more work for the other 2/3 of the labour that isn’t delivery. Not just in the kitchen, but making the ingredients, marketing the chain etc.There is now also new work, in the form of making and maintaining robots.And yes we all get a bit fatter.There is no difference between the labour part of the cost being reduced and the cost of toppings like cheese going down, in fact this is happening as people take up vegetarian and vegan diets where supermarkets and restaurants have discovered they can sell plants for the same cost as meat.You might say the demand for food is finite even if you make it cheaper and I would agree, but the demand for the labour to make it is not so bounded as we see with vegan, vegetarian, gluten free, low salt, high fibre, low calorie nut free, egg free, kosher, halal, fresh, pre-made and all the other ways we get picky about food once we get beyondAs its lockdown, my PC is helping to warm the house and since I’m a geek, it’s a rather meatier machine so warms more. The energy per instruction executed is much lower than 10 or 20 years ago, but the primary purpose of my PC like human labour is to do some task. Yes, it’s helpful to warm my house in January, but liker employing people, using electricity is a means to an end.You employ more labour or less if that suits your business needs, same with power and a more efficient use of electricity means I am more likely to use it. Same iwthn labour, automation is simply an increase in productivity.Not all goods show the price elasticity of pizza. Washing powder for instance, a decrease in price would increase demand a little but ultimately there is a finite demand to wash clothes.Why am I so confident ?Because it has happened again and again, many times for centuries.My sister trained as a copy typist, a job so bizarre that I need to explain it to people under 50.Before word processors, if you wanted to change the wordYepThe wordThese were not obscure niche jobs, this sort of work was a large % of all office labour they were literally calledYet today, more people and as in my examples more women are employed in offices than ever before, OK I’m writing this during the pandemic, but that just means they do it at home.Manufacturing has been decreasing the number of worked hours to make goods cheaper. As (for instance) clothes have got cheaper we consume more of them.Let’s be clear here. A company buys a robot to reduce the cost of doing things. some of course will misjudge this, but in the main more automation means the cost of goods and services go down so we consume more.But can demand be filled as in my example of washing powder ?For some things yes, but let us look at the largest scale problems as terms for demand.Housing, go look at the % of people who don’t have a decent, safe warm and dry place to live and that’s aWhich leads us to think of the effort in decarbonisation the economy on a global scale. Even if you don’t believe in climate change we are rapidly running out of fossils fuels, that’s a vast, huge amount of demand...which we won’t get to in time to stop all the effects of water rising etc so dealing with that is big.Then there’s getting everyone enough food of a decent quality.Then there’s healthcare, which will suck in any amount of labour. Let us imagine that productivity of all medical staff doubles, reckon that will saturate demand ? Or a factor of 10 ?And since we’re making people live longer through better healthcare, diet, living conditions , etc so they will consume more and of course need care when they get old.I’ve not even started on new types of products, which I cannot beieve you have have not noticed.And finally mass customisation, not long from now people will think it barbaric that shoes weren’t made for your individual feet, ditto chairs, clothes etc.So as a small example for my wife's last birthday I had a cake made where I could upload a picture and it would be printed in icing on top. A highly automated process,Earlier I mentioned how as we are more able to afford food we get more picky. It is really not all that hard, (just expensive) for food to be made that suitsThat's what rich people get now, it’s coming to you courtesy of automation. But will require programmers, people who understand nutrition (no not Gwyneth Paltro or other celeb) and the logistics are deliciously complex.But my favourite new job are the people at Microsoft whose job is to train people to watch porn more effectively. They already have professional porn watchers (yes, that’s a job) because Microsoft routinely rummages through your stuff you’ve stored on its Cloud, looking for things that might affect it commercially as well videos that may be illegal.Turns out that despite not able to build a competent search engine, the company that booby trapped Windows to suck you into using Bing (named after the most clueless member of the Friends cast being an aspirational figure for Bing developers), managed to find a whole pile of truly scary stuff.So bad, that the staff sued Microsoft claiming they had PTSD and weren’t trained to cope, so MS now has to care for its porn watchers.Microsoft sued by staff traumatized by child sex abuse vids stashed on OneDrive accountsThat horrible example illustrates that there will be many types of new jobs, some will be bad like watching sick videos or cleaning the nozzles of 3D printers (done that, bad), some will be much the same switching from fixing cars to fixing delivery robots, some like my plumber who drivers a Porsche whose work includes dealing with Google home automation.",1 follower,Kirk Scott,1.4K,13.4K,68.1M,2021,https://www.quora.com/In-Warhammer-40k-why-did-the-Imperium-lose-to-the-Tau-Empire-despite-having-more-advanced-technology-space-marines-tanks-etc

Nearly all of whom then had to take much lower-paying jobs in the service sector, or have no jobs at all.The incomes of the richest men in America has steadily soared in this period, while that of most everyone else has stagnated or even sagged (in the case of most unskilled laborers, in part due to competition from illegal immigrants).First to go was repetitive manual labor and management of same. Next has been repetitive mental labor, then non-creative computational mental labor.Of course smart people can find other avenues of work. But most people aren’t smart, by nature’s design, so to speak. Excess brainpower can actually be deleterious to productivity in most work people did as hunter/gatherers, and it was true even moreso in early agriculture. A few people with smarts were needed for emergencies, for the rare unexpected danger/challenge. Hence the bell-shaped curve of intelligence, along which each succeeding generation has been born for over 200,000 years, and continues to be born this way:You aren’t going to be retraining people in the fat part of the curve to be computer programmers.There have been workplace revolutions before, of course. The industrial revolution saw zillions move from farms to manufacturing plants in cities. But in previous revolutions the IQ needed for the new job wasn’t any higher than the IQ needed for the old job, and lots of workers were still needed.Today the “demand curve” for employment in advanced nations is that bell-shaped curve…inverted. The labor market still needs dummies to push brooms and knowledge workers to, well, work knowledge. But it doesn’t need all that many skilled manual laborers with just high school diplomas.And watch what happens when truck and cab driving get automated. I live near Google and see robot cars driving around here constantly.Now of course the richest men in America could decide to give their workers 30 hour work weeks, full medical insurance and pensions. If they belonged to a different species maybe. Instead they’ve kept all the productivity gains of workers for themselves.There is still a market for the cream of the non-college crop. Germany has done a great job of private/public partnership apprentice programs with such people.But no matter how you slice it, the “free market” doesn’t need more than 50 million Americans, and within decades won’t need 100 million or more Americans. It will take aggressive government policy to deal with this, but the richest men in America purchased one of our two major political parties and currently owns both the federal government and a majority of state governments. So don’t look for change there.The scary thing isn’t workplace automation but the sophistication of right wing propaganda and campaign finance laws and other laws that make it easy for the richest of the rich to convince all those diplaced worked that libruls and foreigners done it to them. Tyranny no longer has to stand behind lots of guns. Instead it uses a giant bullhorn coupled with the susceptibility of Joe Lunchbox to appeals to his biases and fears.Note that Donald J. Trump has never said one word about computerized workplace automation. I doubt he even knows it exists…So I strongly suspect the future is full of frustrated people of average mentality forced to do work that’s too dumb even for them, but with their resentments continuously misdirected at precisely the people who are trying to save them.So instead of this…we’ll get this…because",114 followers,Hemant Sharma,16.7K,151,2.5M,2017,https://www.quora.com/In-Warhammer-40k-why-did-the-Imperium-lose-to-the-Tau-Empire-despite-having-more-advanced-technology-space-marines-tanks-etc
