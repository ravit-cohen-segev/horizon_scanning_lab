It allows you to send money in the form of bitcoin between people, directly.You can use it by creating a private keyBy creating a private key, you alone have control over bitcoins that are associated with a specific “address” that your key unlocks.You use your private key (never ever show anyone your private key, ever, for any reason) to “sign” transfers from your address to other addresses (possibly other people). Your private key is proof that you control those bitcoins, so once again, never ever show it to anyone.Let me make this absolutely clear: No one owns or controls Bitcoin, soAnyone who says otherwise is likely trying to scam you.If you ever lose your private key, the bitcoins will be inaccessible forever. Since no one controls it, no one can help you, no one has the authority or ability to reverse this.Your bitcoin is not stored on your computer,You do not need to have a copy of the blockchain in order to own bitcoin. You only need to have a private key that unlocks an address that has bitcoins in it.Mining bitcoin requires specialized hardwareIn the end, both approaches should give you roughly the same amount of bitcoin over large time scales, though. The difference is whether you have to wait years to get a large reward, or wait days to get small rewards that add up to the same over time.",0 followers,Melissa Aldridge,501,0,0,2022,https://www.quora.com/What-is-Bitcoin-How-can-I-use-it-How-is-it-mining

There are no physical bitcoins, just equilibriums kept on a public record that everybody has straightforward admittance to (albeit each record is encoded). All Bitcoin exchanges are checked by a gigantic measure of registering power through a cycle known as ""mining."" Bitcoin isn't given or upheld by any banks or state administrations, nor is an individual bitcoin important as a product. Despite it not being legitimate delicate in many areas of the planet, Bitcoin is extremely well known and has set off the send-off of many other cryptographic forms of money, altogether alluded to as altcoins.

By and large, mining requires tackling computationally troublesome riddles to find another square, which is added to the blockchain.Bitcoin mining adds and confirms exchange records across the organization. Excavators are compensated with a few Bitcoin; the award is split every 210,000 squares. The square award was 50 new bitcoins in 2009. On May 11, 2020, the third dividing happened, bringing the prize for each square disclosure down to 6.25 bitcoins.5An assortment of equipment can be utilized to mine Bitcoin. Nonetheless, some yield higher prizes than others. Certain microprocessors, called application-explicit coordinated circuits (ASICs), and further developed handling units, like realistic handling units (GPUs), can accomplish more rewards.

Like other cryptocurrencies, the blockchain offers transparency in recording a ledger of payments, and you have full control over your transactions and more anonymity.Because most companies don’t accept Bitcoin payments directly, you’ll need a ""digital"" or ""Bitcoin"" wallet that securely stores your balance. These Bitcoin wallets — which include mobile apps, desktop or online software and hardware (USB device) — allow you to make transactions through both an alphanumeric code and QR code.What is Bitcoin mining?Bitcoin mining is the process of creating new bitcoins by solving extremely complicated math problems that verify transactions in the currency. 'Mining' is performed with sophisticated mining rigs that can solve math problems. The first miner to find the solution to the problem will be awarded a predetermined amount of bitcoin.How to Mine Bitcoin?As we have mentioned earlier, mining is a process involving the participation of mining machines. In the Bitcoin early days, you could mine it on your CPU easily. But these days are long gone, as the soaring popularity and growing acceptance of Bitcoin has attracted plenty of new bitcoin miners, and at the same time, its mining has become increasingly difficult. These developments require that, if you want your mining hardware to be the winner in a race to get the right to verify a block and add it to the blockchain, this mining hardware needs to have the fastest hash power to solve difficult cryptographic puzzles. At present, while some miners choose to mine bitcoin using GPUs (Graphics Processing Unit) which are relatively powerful than CPUs in doing massive amounts of calculations and capable of mining different virtual coins, ASICs (application-specific integrated circuits), specially built for one purpose, are the selections of the majority of large-scale blockchain mines due to their higher efficiency in mining bitcoin than GPUs.",19 followers,Eric Muller,709,0,0,2022,https://www.quora.com/What-is-Bitcoin-How-can-I-use-it-How-is-it-mining

So, it was decided that in April 2014, the bytecoinMonero is headed by a core development team of 7 developers of which 5 have chosen to remain anonymous while two have come out openly in public.

Founded in 2016 and managed over $160 million for institutional investors which is now open to worldwide individual investors. These funds are managed by a team of Binary Trading investment experts.Image courtesy: CoinsutraSpecial features of Monero XMRSo what is it about Monero that makes it so hot and in-demand. What are the unique properties that the CryptoNote algorithm gives it? Let’s check it out.Property #1: Your currency is yoursYou have complete control over your transactions. You are responsible for your money. Because your identity is private no one will be able to see what you are spending your money on.Property #2: It is FungibleAnother interesting property that it gains, thanks to its privacy, is that it is truly fungible. What is fungibility? Investopedia defines fungibility as follows:“Fungibility is a good or asset’s interchangeability with other individual goods or assets of the same type.”So, what is fungible and what is non-fungible.Suppose you borrowed $20 from a friend. If you return the money to him with ANOTHER $20 bill, then it is perfectly fine. In fact, you can even return the money to them in the form of 1 $10 bill and 2 $5 bills. It is still fine. The dollar has fungible properties (not all the time though).However, if you were to borrow someone’s car for the weekend and come back and give them some other car in return, then that person will probably punch on the face. In fact, if you went away with a red Impala and came back with another red Impala then even that is not a done deal. Cars, in this example, are a nonfungible asset.So, what is the deal with fungibility when it comes to cryptocurrency?Let’s look atIn certainThis is where Monero comes in. Since all their data and transactions are private, no one can know what transactions your Monero has gone through before and neither can they know what was used to buy with your Monero. Since its transaction history can never be known, it also means that the “transaction” trail is non-existent. As a result of this, the concept of “tainted” Monero and “clean” Monero doesn’t exist, and hence they are fungible!Property #3: Dynamic ScalabilityTheMonero uses a free block size mechanism with no “pre-set” size limit. However, this also means that malicious miners can clog up the system with disproportionately huge blocks. To prevent this from happening, a block reward penalty is built into the system. This is how it works:Firstly, the median size of the last 100 blocks is taken which is called M100. Now suppose the miners mined a new block and it has a particular size which is called “NBS” aka New Block Size. If NBS > M100, then the block reward gets reduced in quadratic dependency of how much NBS exceeds M100.This means that if NBS is [10%, 50%, 80%, 100%] greater than M100, the block reward gets reduced by [1%, 25%, 64%, 100%]. Generally, blocks greater than 2*M100 are not allowed, and blocks <= 60kB are always free of any reward penalties.Property #4: ASIC (Application Specific Integrated Circuit) ResistantOk, before we get started, let’s just get this out of the way. Monero is not exactly “ASIC resistant”, but the cost of manufacturing ASICs for Monero would be so high that it simply won’t be worth it. Why is that the case? Remember, when we said that Monero was based on the CryptoNote system which makes it distinctly different from bitcoins? Well, the hashing algorithm used in CryptoNote based systems is called “CryptoNight”.Cryptonight was created to build a fairer and moreSo what are the properties of CryptoNight which makes it ASIC Resistant? (The following is taken from “user36303” answer inProperty #5: Multiple keysOne of the more confusing aspects of Monero is its multiple keys. In bitcoin,View Keys:That’s the general overview of the process.The public view key makes the first part of the Monero Address.Spend Keys: If the view key was mostly for the recipient of a transaction, the spend key is all about the sender. As above, there are two spend keys: public spend key and private spend key.The public spend key makes the second part of the Monero address.The Monero address btw is a 95-character string that is made of the public spend and public view key.This can be very confusing right now, but just keep this information in your head, and it will become clearer with subsequent sections.What is the cryptography involved in Monero?How does a transaction in a cryptocurrency work?Every transaction has two sides to it, the input side and the output side. Suppose Alice needs to send some bitcoins to Bob how will it look like?Transaction InputIn order to make this transaction happen, Alice needs to get bitcoins which she has received from various previous transactions. Remember, as we said before, in bitcoins, each and every coin is accounted for via a transaction history. So Alice can make the outputs of her previous transactions the input of the new transaction. Later on, when we talk about “outputs”, especially in the ring signature section, we mean the outputs of the old transaction which become the inputs of the new transaction.So, suppose AliceDiagrammatically, it will look like this:So, that is it from the input side, let’s check out what the output side will look like.Transaction OutputThe output basically will have a number of bitcoins that Bob will possess post transaction and any remaining change that is left over, which is then sent back to Alice. This change then becomes her input value for all future transactions.A pictorial representation of the output side looks like this:Now, this is a very simple transaction that has just one output (apart from the CHANGE), there are transactions that are possible with multiple outputs.Image courtesy: FluffyPony presentation.bitcoinANow, there is a problem with this system. The public address is well…public! Anyone ontheThis is the “Electronic cash triangle” as the Monero team puts it:This is the “Electronic cash triangle” as the Monero team puts it:Image courtesy: FluffyPony presentation.As they put it, an ideal Electronic cash should fulfill three requirements:With Monero, they are attempting to fulfill all these 3 criteria.The underlying philosophy behind Monero is complete privacy and opaqueness.Monero Cryptography #1: Ring SignaturesIn order to understand what ring signatures are and how they help maintain the sender’s privacy let’s take a hypothetical real-life example. When you are sending someone a check, you need to sign it off with your signature right? However, because of that, anyone who sees your check (and knows what your signature looks like) can tell that you are the person who has sent it.Now think about this.Suppose, you pick up 4 random people from the streets. And you merge your signatures with these 4 people to create a unique signature. Nobody will be able to find out whether it really is your signature or not.That, in essence, is how ring signature works. Let’s see its mechanism in the context of Monero.Suppose, Alice has to send 1000 XMR (XMR = Monero) to Bob, how will the system utilize ring signatures to hide her identity? (For simplicity’s sake, we are taking a pre- ringct implementation case..more on that later).Firstly, she will determine her “ring size”. The ring size are random outputs taken from the monero network, which is of the same value as her output aka 1000 XMR. The bigger the ring size, the bigger the transaction and hence higher the transaction fees. She then signs these outputs with her private spend key and sends it to the blockchain. Another thing to note, Alice doesn’t need to ask the owners of these previous transactions their permission to use the outputs.",881 followers,Peter Kichesky,1K,0,0,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-is-Bitcoin-How-can-I-use-it-How-is-it-mining

Users, as already advanced, can ‘freeze’ their TRX tokens to obtain certain benefits.When the user freezes his tokens, he is still the owner of his cryptos but he will not be able to use them for 3 days. It’s the same as keeping money in a savings account: it’s still ours but we can’t touch it for a while.Once you freeze your TRX you will get the following benefits.In short: 1 frozen TRX = 1 Tron Power = 1 Vote.
