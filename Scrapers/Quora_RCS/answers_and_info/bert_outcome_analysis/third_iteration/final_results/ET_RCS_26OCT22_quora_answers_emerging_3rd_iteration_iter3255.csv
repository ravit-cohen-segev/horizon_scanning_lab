And it's not ""artificial consciousness"".Everyone is afraid that AI will suddenly wake up, get upset, and take over the world.Or that AI will wake up and take all of our jobs. This will happen. But without the ""wake up"" part.Below I describe what real AI is.If we want to understand the “existential threat” we first need to know what AI is.Then, if you are at a cocktail party and someone says, ""but what if robots are intelligent?"" you can argue with facts, mixed with a little bit of alcohol.---------A) STATISTICSStatistics is at the heart of most AI programs.Just like statistics is at the heart of a lot of human decision making.For instance, if you see clouds in the sky, your brain thinks: ""Hmmm, the last 100 times I saw clouds this dark, it usually meant it was about to rain"".When you think like that, you are using statistics to make the decision: ""I should _probably_ go inside now.""I'll give an AI example: Siri or Alexa. How does Alexa understand the words you just said?In 1989 I was visiting Carnegie Mellon to decide if I would go to graduate school there.One of the graduate students, Kai-Fu-Lee (now one of the most famous investors in the world and I would check out his excellent recent TED talk on AI) showed me what he was working on:It was speech recognition for the 60 or so commands that might happen on a Navy battleship (ten guesses as to who was funding his project).When you say the word ""Fire!"" a sound wave is created. When you say the word ""hello"" a sound wave that looks different is created.If 100 people say ""Fire"" and 100 people say ""hello"", all of those sounds waves are stored in a database.Now, if a brand new person says ""Hello"" the computer program needs to determine if that person said ""Hello"" or ""fire"".There might be 10 different attributes of every sound wave. It breaks the new person's sound wave into those 10 attributes.Then it compares that ""vector"" of 10 attributes with all of the vectors in its database for ""Hello"" and ""Fire!""It uses a statistical technique called ""Hidden Markov Analysis"" to determine if the sound wave is more like the ""hello""s in the database or more like the ""Fire!"" in the database.Then it says to itself, ""This guy said ""Hello"". ""It then has a line of code that says, ""If someone says ""Hello"" Then say ""Hello"" back"".Additionally, it adds your ""Hello"" to its database.Your ""Hello"" might be slightly different than the other 100 ""Hello""s so it just learned a new way to say ""Hello"". That gives it greater ability in the future to recognize the word ""hello"".In other words, it ""learned"".So it used Statistics to hear you, code to respond to you, and database technology to learn. There's no real intelligence there but it feels like it's intelligence.Multiply that by 30 years and millions of patterns and computers a million times faster and you have Alexa and Siri in today's kitchens.Ask ""Siri"" what gender it is.-----B) EVALUATION FUNCTIONI just mentioned about language recognition. But how does a self-driving car work?Every second it has to make a decision. Does it move forward? Does it brake? Does it swerve to avoid an accident? Does it turn left?How does it get from point A to point B?1) Google Maps. - Using GPS it knows where it is. And it puts itself on Google Maps.2) List all of the possible routes. This is a ""hard"" problem in the mathematical sense (there's no way for it to guess the fastest route. It has to list each route and then sort by the shortest. )But now computers are so fast what would normally be a slow decision (drive me from this corner in Piscataway, New Jersey to the capital building of Sacramento, California) now just takes seconds.3) Waze. Use Waze to eliminate the routes with too much traffic.4) Start driving.5) Statistics: Every microsecond it uses statistics to see if there is blank space or an object that must be avoided or a traffic sign that must be followed.6) Decide what to do according to the code. For each traffic sign, it has code that tells it what to do (if a sign says ""Stop"" it Stops for a second, uses Statistics to see if any traffic is happening on its sides (with radar and cameras to provide the images). )If there is a person standing in front of it, it might just stop.If there's traffic it didn't expect, it might trigger the program to re-route.If it's blank space it will just keep going.If there's a baby crossing the street and it has to swerve to avoid hitting it, but if swerving will cause the car to hit a truck, killing the passenger in the car, then the ""AI"" of the car is dependent on the ethical decisions of the programmer of the car.In other words, in every situation, it determines it's options, then uses an ""evaluation function"" programmed by a coder, to determine which option has the most successful outcome (move the trip forward, don't kill anyone).Eventually the evaluation function will NOT be programmed by a human coder.Instead, through thousands of experiences of other self-driving cars, the experiences plus the outcomes will all be put into a central database.When a new experience is encountered, the code will look up that experience in the database and the database will spit back the best possible outcome.The code will learn statistically what the best outcomes are of each possibly decision and change the code accordingly and send updates to all self-driving cars.-----C) TREESThe hardest game in the world is a board game called GO. With chess, if a computer can evaluate a billion possibilities a second, it can be a world champion level player.But a Go game can involve trillions of possibilities. How did Google make a program, Deep Go, to beat the world's best Go player. This was thought to be impossible.And yet Google did it.For any game, a computer program first builds a tree of possibilities. Much like a human would.A human thinks: ""If I make this move in checkers, my opponent might respond with A, B, or C and then I can do D, E, or F and then my opponent can do G, H, I if I do D or it can do J, K, L if I do E and I'm never going to do F.A computer doesn't select as well as a human so it builds the FULL tree. Meaning, what are ALL of the possible moves it can do, what are ALL of the possible responses of my opponent, etc.And then it uses a programmed evaluation function to look at the leaves of the tree it built.Whichever move results in the best leaf of the tree (as determined by the evaluation function) that is the move it makes.That's how computer chess worked for decades. I'll get to the secret sauce in a second for how computers conquered chess.And then after that I'll describe how computers miraculously conquered Go.It's only a miracle until science can explain it. It's only ""intelligence"" until it can be coded by a programmer.D) HARDWAREEverybody thought for decades (including many Nobel Prize winners) that the best computer chess programs would be developed when scientists encoded the knowledge of the best chess players in the world into the evaluation function.How does the world champion value a position instead of a weak player?This turned out to be wrong.The MORE code in the evaluation function (i.e. the ""smarter"" the evaluation function was from a human perspective) the SLOWER the program.Which meant a smaller tree would be built, which meant less possibilities would be analyzed.What really allowed the programmers at IBM to build ""Deep Blue"" which beat Garry Kasparov in 1997 were two things.Both related to hardware.a. Computers got faster.And finally, they made the evaluation function STUPID in order to use less code so the hardware could value more positions.Then, before anyone caught on to their ""artificial intelligence"" they retired Deep Blue right after it beat the World Champion of chess.As hardware gets faster, artificial intelligence gets ""smarter"".[as an aside, I once gave a date a chip that was the initial chip for “Chip Test” - the “ancestor” of what became the best chess computer, Deep Blue. She was weirded out.]----INTERLUDEWhat I just described is all the basics. You can stop now.The rest of artificial intelligence is simply combining the basics to make more advanced techniques.-----E) STATISTICS + TREERemember the TREE from computer gaming. And STATISTICS from speech recognition.Now let's go to the impossible game of Go. Google developed the program ""AlphaGo"" to win at Go when everyone else thought it would take another 20 to 50 years.First, remember Kai-Fu Lee who worked on speech recognition. And later developed Apple's first attempts at speech recognition in the 90s?At one point in his grad student days, he was getting tired of navy battleship commands (as one does) and decided to focus on building a program to play Othello.He ended up building the world champion of Othello.He took a lot of games, let's say a million, and put them in a database. And each position from each game, he would label, ""winning"" (if it was a position on the winning side) or ""losing"" in a massive database.He would identify several attributes of each position (how many white pieces, versus black pieces, how many corners were controlled, how many pieces were on the sides, etc).Now, if the computer was playing a brand new game, it would determine all the attributes of that position, then use Hidden Markov Analysis (remember: speech recognition) to match that position to the database.If the position pattern-matched a ""winning position"" then it would make the move that would lead to that winning position. If it matched a ""losing position"" it would not make that move.That program became the world champion of Othello.AlphaGo took it one step further.It put in the positions of millions of Go positions and did the same sort of breakdown.It used faster hardware to speed up the process.Then, once it became pretty good at GO, it played BILLIONS of games against ITSELF to put many BILLIONS of new positions into the database. In other words, it ""learned"".Now it was ready to play Go. It crushed the world champion------That's basically it. That's all of artificial intelligence.Let's say a bank wanted to fire all of the employees in charge of lending. And replace them by artificial intelligence.How would the bank lend money?Well, there's 100s of millions of loans already out there. And for each person who has ever borrowed money I know:- their ageI can put all these vectors in a database and divide them into people ""most likely to pay back the loan"" and people ""most likely to default"".Then, just like speech recognition or the Othello program above, I can use statistics to determine who I should loan money to.And if I say ""no"", I don't have to explain. On to the next one!---Let's say I want to fight terrorists.I already have examples of many terrorists who trained in the US and then went on to perform or attempt acts of terror.I know everything about their bank accounts. How often they transferred money. How often they traveled. How often they took out cash versus using a debit card.And so on.I can build a vector of attributes of what a terrorist bank account looks like. Then I can match new people against that database of vectors of terrorists.Believe me, every time you do a bank transfer, some AI program is out there trying to determine if you are a terrorist.----This is all that AI is.It is nothing more. It's not ""intelligent"" from a human sense. It's not conscious, nor will it ever be.Here's how AI has improved in the past forty years (and how it will improve the next 40):- statistics has gotten betterWhat is changing the fastest is data. The land grab of modern society is not land, or gold, or oil.It's data.I have been invested in many companies that collect and sell data. I was an early investor (and on the board of)Believe me when I say, data-driven companies know how many strawberries you ate last summer.And right now that data is used mostly to target you for ads about sneakers. Or politics.But this is AI 1.0. Soon that data will be used to target your every movement, your every want, your every need.Amazon Prime won't be about delivering you what you want tomorrow. Amazon Prime Plus will be about delivering you what you want yesterday.Police 2.0 will be like the movie ""Minority Report"".Even art and music will be driven by AI that studies the neurochemical responses to music you like to music you don't like. And then compose accordingly.Where will humans still be unique?I don't know. Ask the humans with AI implants that enhance their brains so when they look at you they know exactly what answers will make you happy.BUT… will AI replace jobs?The answer (at least in the next decade or so…) is NO.Look at recent examples:A) Many people were worried ATM machines would replace bank tellers.Instead, the banks made so much in profits they opened up more branches than ever, creating new jobs.B) Will autonomous delivery services cost jobs.Right now there are millions of truck drivers involved in delivering goods. With autonomous delivery, less people will go shopping, more people will be required to shop in the aisles, finding products for people.Obviously this is not a high-end job. But this replaces the fact that less cashiers and drivers will be needed.Meanwhile, there will be more high-end jobs. More maintenance engineers for the cars, customer service, marketing, etc.C) Ecommerce. Branding will become less important (branding is VERY important when everyone is shopping at the big box store but advertising will have to become more clever and digital) so the millions in profits that are generated from AI will filter down to more people starting e-commerce ventures and the ancillary businesses associated with that.)Final conclusion:This is probably a net NEGATIVE for society as the higher classes will be able to afford “super AI” capabilities, making them demi-gods to lower-classes.Instead, massive profits will be generated, which will be soaked into the economy through a rising stock market, increase in opportunities, etc.",2 followers,John Nofsinger,1.9K,3.1K,14.9M,2018,https://www.quora.com/How-many-artificial-planets-the-size-of-Earth-could-future-humans-with-advanced-technology-create-from-the-astroid-belt

6,"We cannot make gravitational black holes in a lab, but surprisingly we can create acoustic or sonic ones and test some properties of the real ones on them.They arise in flowing liquids when perturbations of sound waves called phonons in them are slower than the speed of the flow of this fluid. This is similar to photons not being able to escape real black holes. Similarly to real black holes, there is an event horizon in acoustic ones; the boundary where the flow of liquid changes from being faster than the speed of sound to the area where it is slower than the speed of sound. Just like in natWe cannot make gravitational black holes in a lab, but surprisingly we can create acoustic or sonic ones and test some properties of the real ones on them.They arise in flowing liquids when perturbations of sound waves called phonons in them are slower than the speed of the flow of this fluid. This is similar to photons not being able to escape real black holes. Similarly to real black holes, there is an event horizon in acoustic ones; the boundary where the flow of liquid changes from being faster than the speed of sound to the area where it is slower than the speed of sound. Just like in natural black holes, phonons in perfect fluids move like gravity in spacetime.One of the notable features of black holes, Hawking Radiation, was tested this way on sound waves by using stretched-out Bose-Einstein condensate as the liquid. It had a transition within created with lasers in such a way that on one side, it flowed faster than the speed of sound, and on the other side, it flowed slower. This prevented the phonons from getting across these two layers and caused a phononic analog of photonic Hawking Radiation to appear.Furthermore, the theoretical process of energy extraction from black holes called the Penrose superradiance was also tested on sound waves. A few speakers arranged into a circle played the same sound with a small delay in each. There was a central, spinning cylinder made of sound-absorbing foam. When the cylinder spun slowly, the sound became quieter, but when it spun faster, it became louder, which means that it gained some energy from the spinning of the cylinder. In the same way, energy can be extracted from a rotating black hole by shooting photons at it.Until it ever becomes possible to create our own real microscopic black holes that would not be dangerous, their sonic versions present a fascinating opportunity to test many aspects of these mysterious objects that are otherwise too far in our Galaxy for us ever to send probes to or visit.The question was: Can we make our own black hole?",UNKNOWN,Robert Frost,516,9.4K,195.6M,2021,https://www.quora.com/How-many-artificial-planets-the-size-of-Earth-could-future-humans-with-advanced-technology-create-from-the-astroid-belt

A lot of these legends relate to weapons, trojan horses to climb over a city wall, talos throwing rocks possibly an early catapult, legendary swords perhaps a memory of a lost art in metalwork. Many things that I would call technology (metallurgy, toolmaking and astronomy, in some respects practitioners of early science and engineering) are referred to as magicians and some become legends or myth. It may be a consequence of those that don’t understand how these things are done trying to explain them. Merlin may just be a reference to druids practising astronomy or the ability to make tools, instruments or weapons for example. Do I believe Merlin existed, no, do I believe that druids practised certain arts which we don’t understand, probably and the tale is likely to relate to this. Same thing with Daedalus, the chief engineer to the ruler, maybe, but my own view is there are just too many inventions for a single person to create in a lifetime, a position in this society and merchants playing up the story to get a better price for a trade good likely why he became legendary.The general view that there has always been steady progress is incorrect, the archaeology in prehistory suggests that new technology did emerge, the trade-in obsidian (volcanic glass) is an example, which was a material used for tools before metal, entire trade networks are created, fairly advanced settlements arise and then collapse, then re-emerge somewhere else (or not). The road to advancement is not always straight and continuously improves, there are wars, civilisations collapse. Mostly the knowledge of these technologies is preserved and reemerges, but occasionally it does not. Some of the stone age technologies are jaw-dropping, it was the material of the time and by the end of this age they were getting really good at working with it too, they show a complete mastery of it when civilisations emerge, there weren’t any power tools so assembling millions of stones into a pyramid requires real organisation. The best I’ve seen is a grinding wheel around 7500BCE according to a precision ground artefact, an early machine in the stone age with good old human power.I’m interested in Minoan technology and a lot of this is either lost or scatters to the four corners around bronze age collapse. A practical example of this is murex purple dye production. Phoenician, right? Not according to the archaeology, there are known sites where this was first produced, there are obvious myth relating to textiles, a spiders web (silk, a wonder material), spinning a yarn (story) for example.There are myths of Dactyls (fingers) that are accredited with inventing iron forges and discovering lodestones (a magnetic compass). The archaeology is starting to emerge that would suggest that in this case there may be some substance to these oral accounts which were written down later. Some of the first forges are found on Crete (the other early sites being Troy). A single land-based compass is found on Crete and Minoan building are aligned to magnet North from around 1900BCE, which implied they knew about iron (possibly, magnetite from Skyros, struck by lightning). TheSo in some very rare cases, there are examples of technology which is lost and unearthed by archaeology, where there is some form of account in mythology or legend, but NOT many.

15,"Not meaningfully so, no.There are some historical technologies we can’t quite reproduce, but they’re not terribly significant ones: certain kinds of pottery glazes, dyes, and the like. The best known “lost” technology is probably Greek fire, the famous Medieval incendiary. Generally speaking, these are things where we know the results of the process, but we really don’t know the components which went into it, and we suspect that it relies on the specific properties of limited natural mineral deposits, species of plants, and the like.

Oh, and there’s talk that we’ve lost some of the knowledge around some of the early big rockets used get us in orbit and around the moon. But in all cases, what we’re missing is specific historic techniques. We can produce dyes in any color we like, make incendiaries of every description, send rockets into orbit, and so on. We just can’t do them exactly as they did in the past.","5,990 followers",Jens Böttiger,566,2.6K,17.6M,2020,https://www.quora.com/How-many-artificial-planets-the-size-of-Earth-could-future-humans-with-advanced-technology-create-from-the-astroid-belt
