Maybe robotic moon bases, chips implanted in our brains, self-driving cars and high-speed rail linking London to Beijing. According to a dazzling number of technology predictions that single out the year 2020, it's going to be to be one heck of a year. Here, we take a look at some of the wonders it has in store.2020, of course, is just a convenient target date for roughly-10-years-off predictions. ""It's not any more particularly interesting, in my opinion, than 2019 or 2021,"" says Mike Liebhold, a Distinguished Fellow at the Institute for the Future, and an all-around technology expert with a resume that includes stints with Intel, Apple, and even Netscape.Liebhold now helps clients take a long view of their businesses so they can make better decisions in the short term. He and his colleagues at the Institute for the Future don't help clients read tea leaves but they do help them read what he calls the signals — those things you can see in the world today that allow you to make reasonable forecasts about what the future holds.In other words, the year 2020 (and 2019, and 2021) is Liebhold's business. And he forecasts a pretty interesting world a decade from now. So what will the world look like in 2020? With Liebhold riding shotgun, we took a quick spin through 2020 to see what the future might hold.Japan will build a robotic moon baseJAXAThere’s no technological reason why Japan shouldn't be able to move forward with its ambitious plan to build a robotic lunar outpost by 2020 — built by robots, for robots. In fact, there’s really no nation better for the job in terms of technological prowess.The Institute for the Future’s Mike Liebhold says, “There are private launch vehicles that are probably capable of doing that, and I think the robotics by that point are going to be quite robust.”PopSci Predicts: Technologically possible, but economics will be the deciding factor.AdvertiseChina will connect Beijing to London via high-speed railCourtesy of Popular ScienceChina’s plan:Link the East and West with a high-speed rail line. Not linking the Eastern with the Western parts of China — they're talking about linking the Eastern world with the Western world.How to deal with the inevitable headaches of a 17-country train? Offer to pick up the tab. China would pay for and build the infrastructure in exchange for the rights to natural resources such as minerals, timber and oil from the nations that would benefit from being linked in to the trans-Asian/European corridor.PopSci Predicts: Possible but unlikely.Cars will drive themselvesCourtesy of Popular ScienceIt's long been a dream of, well, just about everyone, from Google and DARPA to automakers themselves: utter safety and ease of transport thanks to self-driving cars. There's movement being made, but the first hurdle to clear is a big one: Getting all these heterogenous cars to speak to one another. We don't yet have the wireless infrastructure, globally speaking, to link all our cars with all our traffic tech.PopSci Predicts: Certainly doable, but not by 2020.Biofuels will be cost-competitive with fossil fuelsU.S. NavyThe U.S. military has pledged to get half its energy from renewable resources by 2020, and the Navy whole-heartedly believes it can turn to 50 percent biofuels by then. It makes political sense not to rely on volatile regions for energy, and this push could mean both cleaner vehicle fleets and a major bump in the competitiveness of biofuels in the market.PopSci Predicts: Feasible.AdvertiseThe 'flying car' will be airborneCourtesy of Popular ScienceThe rebirth of the flying car? Liebhold, of the Institute for the Future, shoots this one down. ""No. The air traffic control for something like that is incredible."" It's a problem in every way — logistically we can't do it, cost-wise we can't do it, and technologically it's extremely unlikely. Oh well.PopSci Predicts: The military might have its prototype “flying humvee” by 2020 (DARPA wants it by 2015), but the tech won’t trickle down to the rest of us for quite a while.We'll control devices via microchips implanted in our brainsCourtesy of Popular ScienceThe human brain remains biology’s great, unconquered wilderness, and while the idea of meshing the raw power of the human mind with electronic stimulus and responsiveness has long existed in both science fiction and — to some degree — in reality, we likely won’t be controlling our devices with a thought in 2020 as Intel has predicted. While it’s currently possible to implant a chip in the brain and even get one to respond to or stimulate gross neural activity, we simply don’t understand the brain’s nuance well enough to create the kind of interface that would let you channel surf by simply thinking about it.“Neural communications are both chemical and electrical,” Liebhold says. “And we have no idea about how that works, particularly in the semantics of neural communication. So yeah, somebody might be able to put electronics inside somebody’s cranium, but I personally believe it’s only going to be nominally useful for very, very narrow therapeutic applications.”PopSci Predicts: We might have chips in the brain by 2020, but they won’t be doing much.All new screens will be ultra-thin OLEDsCourtesy of Popular ScienceDisplay tech moves incredibly fast. There will certainly still be some “antique” LCD monitor screens hanging around in 2020, but as far as new stock is concerned, it’s easy to see the entire industry shifting to paper-thin OLED surfaces, many with touch capability.“So surfaces will become computational,"" Liebhold says. ""walls, mirrors, windows. I think that's legitimate.”PopSci Predicts: “Give that one a high probability,” Liebhold says. Done.AdvertiseCommercial space will take us to the moon and asteroids (and we'll be mining them)SpaceXA two-parter: commercial trips to the moon (which is becoming a bustling space industry as you read this) and mining extraterrestrial bodies. That last part seems less likely — we haven't yet figured out what long-term space travel would do to the human body, and even robotic missions are likely several decades off.PopSci Predicts: Commercial space travel is the real deal, but beyond orbital flights things become exponentially more difficult. The moon, asteroids and mining missions are unlikely targets within the 2020 time frame.A $1,000 computer will have the processing power of the human brainZephyris via WikimediaCisco’s chief futurist made this prediction a couple of years ago, and it seems reasonable in some ways. Not intelligence, really, but purely the ""ability, the number of cycles,"" as Liebhold puts it, is on track given Moore's Law.PopSci Predicts: Likely.Universal translation will be commonplace in mobile devicesGoogleThis one's under intense development, both in practical forms like Google Translate and crazier ones from DARPA. Translation will probably happen in the cloud, consulting with massive bodies of language knowledge compiled by companies and governments.PopSci Predicts: Probable, but with varying degrees of accuracy depending on the language.AdvertiseWe'll finally see some decent AR glassesAugmented reality is highly visible on smartphone apps, but we want more — we want rich, customizable, relevant and easy to access AR overlaid directly onto whatever we happen to be looking at. That depends on the glasses and GPS, which should be accurate enough to keep up with the real world by 2020, but also on the spatial web, with geolocation data.PopSci Predicts: We’re already halfway thereWe'll create a synthetic brain that functions like the real dealOnce we have a computer with the processing power of a brain, can we build a brain from scratch? Researchers at Switzerland's Blue Brain Project think so. But there's an argument that as we build a brain, we'll learn more and more about it, increasing the rate of difficulty as we proceed.PopSci Predicts: We’ll get there.

You can bring it up as something you read about, and that gives you the opportunity to express how important 'words of affirmation' are for you (and it sounds like they are) without automatically accusing her of letting you down. You might find that she values one of the other 'love languages' more and, because it doesn't matter to you so much, you don't notice it. For instance, maybe she buys you little souvenirs to give you when she sees you, but that's not something that you pick up on because 'gifts' don't matter so much to you.Or it may be that 'physical affection' and 'quality time' are her normal means of expressing love and she's not able to do that at the moment seeing as you're in a LDR. I think a lack of these two 'love languages' is probably the biggest challenge to sustaining a LDR and maintaining a sense of that person's love and influence in your life. You can be creative and have fun with solving the problem though.

And for people who are in relationships and haven't met in person - some people would say that this is silly, unrealistic and even dangerous - like people who get catfished and have their lives ruined emotionally and/or financially. Some come out on the bright side though.Take me for example.Whilst preparing for my final year of university, I was bored one day and decided to try something new - basically procrastinating. I stumbled upon a site called penpalworld. As you might have guessed, you can send digital letters/emails to people from all around the world. I messaged some people from Europe, Asia, Africa and America and got some decent conversations going.Whilst doing this for a while, I stumbled across this incredibly beautiful girl from the Philippines.I read her bio and she seemed very cool, so I messaged her and we got talking.We sent each other long emails everyday and got to know each other pretty well. We sent paper letters and emails. The beauty of writing letters is that you can talk about deep stuff, interesting topics that you typically wouldn't have in small talk. For every letter I sent, I was eagerly waiting her reply, and for every email I sent, I was constantly checking my inbox.After some weeks, we added each other on Facebook and messaged every day. Good morning texts. Good night texts. I miss you texts. At this point I was very much in love and I couldn't take her off my mind. I didn't tell her at this point from fear of losing her.I decided to video call her one day and it there she was, in her bedroom, beautiful as she was in her pictures. We talked for hours and hours. We called pretty much every day after that. We got on so well and were inseparable from each others lives. Because she had no WiFi and relied on mobile data, we had tons of connection problems. Sometimes unbearable, but we stuck at it.It wasn't too long until I fell so in love with her that I asked her to be my girlfriend (this was a leap of faith for me as I was frightened I would get friendzoned) - she wholeheartedly accepted and professed her love to me too! So we became a couple!My friends knew about my relationship with her and some were sceptical, all were supportive. I didn't tell my parents at the time over fear of being judged and being overprotected.From then on we carried on as we were. I wanted to meet her so badly but couldn't afford to fly and meet her. Not to mention the responsibility of attending my university course. The same for her. It was hard.We talked everyday. We both completed our degrees at university. We both found jobs. We worked and messaged each other when we could. This went on for over 2 years.Time is precious in a relationship like ours. The time difference is tough. She is 8 hours ahead of me. The connection issues are tough and it can be frustrating at times to try and keep a conversation flowing. We had many hardships along the way, like family members dying and many other personal problems. We stayed strong through many ups and downs.I told my parents about her and how long the relationship was going on. They were sceptical, protective, worried - everything parents should feel. I managed to convince them that I was in a strong relationship with a real person, not some old fat guy across the world trying to clean my bank account. My parents were supportive of me.I had been working for 7 months and saved up enough for a flight to the Philippines! I booked a flight for Christmas and I could not wait. We both saved and saved for our time of 2 weeks together. It was something I had to do, I had to meet her.Fast forward to December 2018 and it happened! We met! We spent an incredible 2 weeks together!We finally made it happen. It was like a dream come true. I had her in my arms. We were very much in love. We went on trips, ate lots of food, had so many wonderful experiences.The heartbreaking part of the story is that I had to fly back to England. It was incredibly hard to leave her. I plan on going back in the summer to see her again. We have long term plans on living together in the UK, which is not as easy as it sounds. It requires patience and hardwork.The moral of the story is that if you want something, go for it. You can follow your dreams. You can achieve what you can achieve and with persistence you can do anything.Long distance relationships can create unbreakable bonds. But these relationships are extremely difficult in most cases and it takes strength and a strong commitment to overcome the hardships that come with them.Thank you for reading!EditThank you for 1k upvotes Quorans! I'm very humbled by your kind comments and I say good luck to all of you who are in long distance relationships! If you truly believe in your love, grab it and don't let it go.

And a lot here, means around 5-8 hours a day of chatting, calling, skype etc! We used to have late night calls very frequently lasting for as long as 3-5 hours every night! That was our courtship period - the time you get to know each other, the time that is important and 'best' in every relationship, but once we knew all about each other, the talks reduced as the topics started vanishing. It didn't mean we lost interest, we both were highly interested in each other, and pretty much in love with each other as well! But since we had nothing to talk about for most of the day, the call time reduced from 5-8 hours to hardly 1-2 hours a day - which was still pretty much - a lot - compared to what we have left today!Now, if I talk about ""right now"" like December 2015 - he has a job which requires him at different shifts everyday. Someday he's working from 2 pm - 11 pm, and someday he has night shifts too (he's in IT!), and so the entire talk-schedule is disrupted. Now, we chat with each other for hardly 10-20 messages a day, most of them are about 'how are you?' 'did you eat anything?', 'how is your day?' and finally 'can you call if you have a minute?'. And then the calls have shrunk to hardly 2 calls per day - out of which one is the ""good-morning call"" and the other is ""good night call"". That is ALL! But again - that does not mean I don't love him or he lost interest in me. We still FaceTime on weekends and we meet twice in a year (which isn't something to be proud of, but that's all I have right now!). But it all depends upon the person, as I told you.It's not that we have made all these rules of 2 messages and 2 calls, it's the schedule that has bound us that way. If I am really really missing him on some days, I tell him to call me and I tell him to be free in the evening, and he DOES take out time for me! But demanding that everyday would be stupid - on my part and to deliver it would be impossible on his part as he's a working man, and I have to understand his limitations! However, when we will be married, we will have all the time in the world for each other, but right now, I believe this is our struggle-period going on, where we have to stand true to each other and prove our love, so that we can have a good life tomorrow! If we keep arguing or bickering about stupid things, I don't think he will be able to do his job, neither will we both able to stay together that way! There are compromises required from both sides in every relationship.Good luck for your LDR! :)","32,748 followers",Smriti Iyer,2.5K,357,6.2M,2016,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-interesting-possibilities-that-will-likely-occur-before-2045

We had been dating for just over a year and a half before I left for the US.I think the biggest challenge we faced like everyone else was lack of communication considering the time difference which was about 11 hours. I would wake up to her Facetime calls and they would just be 5 minutes long on an average. But those 5 minutes every day for 3 years went a long way for us. There were days when both of us would be busy, making it extremely difficult for us to talk but for the most part we made it a point that we talked for those 5 minutes.And I think that was it, there were no trust issues or insecurities between the two of us. Neither was there ever a thought of us not being together, even when we did not know if our families would approve of our relationship if and when we decide to get married ( yes, coming from India, family approval will always have extreme importance, atleast it did for us ). To add more context, for the first couple of years I was not even sure if I would be going back to India or staying in the US. Infact, a few of our friends asked us individually if we would want to stay in a relationship considering how easily they break apart for a lot of people. Inspite of these and a lot of other things, we realised the best way is to take things as they come and not dwell too much over them. Once you accept that, it will become a lot easier.And beyond that, I guess both of us got really lucky to have found each other (that is a story for another time, though) and that in the end it worked out really well for us.We completed 6 years of our relationship few months back. We got married almost a year back. We are closer than ever before, we never fight, (apart from the usual fight that starts with ‘me forgetting the towel on the bed’ and ends at ‘her not managing her finances well’) and we never take each other for granted (well I do sometimes. but she makes sure I realise that every single time.)But yeah, thats it! Think if you truly love someone you will figure out a way against all odds. Have faith.Hope that helps!P.S: thats us in the picture.Update 1: Thank you everyone for the response. Its not a big deal, honestly. It is like loosing weight, if you are too conscious about it, you will give in someday, but if you take it up as a part of your daily routine, its not a huge deal, really. Attaching some more pictures as per requests in comments. Again thank you everyone for the kind words and upvotes :)Update 2: Thank you all for the kind words, really do appreciate it. We just completed 3 years of our marriage and 9 years of togetherness. Infact a couple of years back we even started working together for a join business venture. It opened a whole new dimension of our relationship and we savor each and every moment of us being lucky enough to work together and yes make some money out of it.

Grapevine cannot always spread the word. But, why rely on it? This gives rise to preconceptions and confusion as messages are not filtered down correctly. Why depend on technology (email, group chats)? Why not talk face-to-face and sort it out? Why not be clear and concise?Poor listeningAutocratic leaders make choices based on their ideas and experience. They dismiss employees’ fear, opinions, needs, and advice. So, feeling letdown and job burnout are common outcomes of poor communication in the team. What’s the harm in just listening to your employee once?Assumption that everyone can speak wellLeaders and managers must encourage employees to share their ideas, opinions, and innovative thinking. Unfortunately, some managers lack the capability to boost people to express themselves as they assume everyone is a good communicator. So, feeling awkward or embarrassed in team meetings is quite obvious.Thank you!",183 followers,Virginia Woodley,711,674,2.5M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-interesting-possibilities-that-will-likely-occur-before-2045
