From here, we can’t even make out our solar system let alone individual planets. The galaxy is enormous. We are rotating what is believed to be a black hole. Current scientific estimates conclude that there are approximately 100 billion stars in our galaxy alone with planets orbiting them.As we travel further into space, the entire galaxy becomes just a dot of light. Each of those other dots are other galaxies.Further away, it is possible to see the Virgo Supercluster. That red notation represents our local galactic group, containing all of the galaxies near us. In that is the Milky Way galaxy. In that is the solar interstellar neighborhood. In that is our solar system. In that is planet Earth.The local supercluster group contains the virgo supercluster, where we are located, as well as the other superclusters near us.That tiny dot that you can hardly make out on the screen is the Virgo Supercluster. All of those other dots are superclusters. And this is just the observable universe that we can estimate. It is believed that there are countless, perhaps even infinite, other dimensions. Theoretically, planet Earth could have entire civilizations that exist in other dimensions we can’t access or interact with at the present time. Then there is the issue of time and gravity. If time travel is possible, all of these universes would be occurring at the same time everywhere in all dimensions.Multiverse?The multiverse is a hypothetical group of multiple universes.Together, these universes comprise everything that exists: the entirety of space, time, matter, energy, information, and the physical laws and constants that describe them.Do you still think we are alone in the Universe?",UNKNOWN,Pallab Roy Chowdhury (GENERAL non Ews),1.5K,357,20.6M,2020,https://www.quora.com/If-aliens-asked-you-to-go-away-with-them-without-knowing-anything-other-than-they-are-aliens-with-advanced-technology-would-you-go-and-why

8,"There have been many advances in all areas. Anesthesia is better- it is shorter acting and has less effect on suppressing the heart function. The heart lung machine works exactly the same but it is much more reliable. The drugs used to support the heart are hugely better. But maybe the biggest advance has been in understanding and controlling bleeding and the coagulation cascade. We can now determine exactly what blood products, such as platelets, cryoprecipitate, fresh frozen plasma, rbc’s, or the specific clotting factors that are needed. In addition, bioglue is a wonderful product. TogetherThere have been many advances in all areas. Anesthesia is better- it is shorter acting and has less effect on suppressing the heart function.

9,"I think there has been more progress on how to repair the heart as opposed to relying on transplants. Where possible, the emphasis is on minimally invasive techniques.

It is a way to replace the aortic valve, which is the valve that controls the flow of blood from the heart to the rest of the body.Other heart valves, such as mitral valves, can be repaired or replaced using minimally invasive surgery, if the patient meets specific criteria.This approach speeds recovery and lowers the chance of infection.

Left Ventricular Assistive Devices allow for the recipient to hang in there longer so an appropriate donor heart can be obtained. There are, of course, issues with the LVAD, though some surgeons believe they may be able to replace transplants.
