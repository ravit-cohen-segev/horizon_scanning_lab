I try and understand as far as possible how it works and what it might do inside the eye, and satisfy myself that such technology is both safe and effective. So in other words, it should not harm the eye first of all. Secondly, it should do what it is supposed to do and be worth the effort and expense used in providing the technology.Although this seems pretty clear cut, it is not always so. Sometimes, early studies are published which show good results, but based on common knowledge of biology we might expect something bad to happen. Or we might expect the reported results to be not so great.Given the huge marketing efforts expended by device manufaturers, it is doubly important that as service providers we can see through all the fluff, and get at the most important bits.Don’t get me wrong. I am hugely grateful for the numerous innovations in ophthalmic care that have made such a huge difference in our patient’s lives. But for every phacoemulsification or LASIK there are numerous duds, as mentioned above. Each new technology that becomes available, especially in the medical field, needs to be held to a much higher standard of scrutiny than, say, a new iteration or evolution of an established product. And FDA approval is also no guarantee of safety or efficacy.Ultimately, what counts is the well being of our patients.",0 followers,Slack-Man,508,4.5K,58.1M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-new-technology-or-attraction-can-we-as-organisers-introduce-in-a-medical-conference-to-make-it-more-interesting-and-engaging-for-the-doctors-Luxury-hotel-venues-LED-wall-display-and-live-surgery-are-all-a-passe
