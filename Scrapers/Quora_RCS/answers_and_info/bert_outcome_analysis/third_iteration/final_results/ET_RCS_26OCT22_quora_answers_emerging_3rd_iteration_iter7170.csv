1,"I’m honestly surprised at all of these answers. I’ll start off by saying that it’s pretty unclear what you mean. You threw a very broad question on the internet, hoping you’d get a decent answer. I recommend being more specific with questions.I’m honestly surprised at all of these answers. I’ll start off by saying that it’s pretty unclear what you mean. You threw a very broad question on the internet, hoping you’d get a decent answer. I recommend being more specific with questions.A whole bunch of other points could be made. Just know, Node will never compare to Golang. Just because people use it more than Go doesn’t mean anything. Just means people try to find the easiest thing to use and the hottest buzzwords around. That’s why PHP is still used",420 followers,Rob Brown,908,7.8K,9.7M,2018,https://www.quora.com/I-m-interested-in-web-development-I-have-started-learning-Node-js-Is-Node-js-a-good-technology-for-web-development-or-should-I-shift-to-another-technology

3,"For most endeavors to take off, money and resources are needed. When you are in the process of experimenting and doing research in the hopes of discovering a scientific breakthrough, more often than not, you’ll burn money without the guarantee of getting it back. That’s why it’s important that the government or enough individuals and institutions support the development of science and technology.Otherwise, people who could have spent pouring their lives in it might be forced to pursue something else in order to survive.Sadly, this seems to happen often in the Philippines.

Many people and organizations are focused on cutting costs, investing as little as possible and being assured they can immediately recoup their investment. It’s hard to blame them when many people struggle to make ends meet. It’s also sad that some institutions who have the capacity to do not step up to the task because there isn’t much in it for them, they want an easy way out, or the government do not make enough rules or rewards to motivate them.Many Filipinos, as individuals, are also not that aware of how crucial it is to be supportive of the development of science and technology. Some simply don’t care but a good number too, are too busy trying to survive. It’s really important to have enough money so as you can focus on the right things.",2 followers,Richard Muller,1.7K,2.3K,202.4M,2021,https://www.quora.com/I-m-interested-in-web-development-I-have-started-learning-Node-js-Is-Node-js-a-good-technology-for-web-development-or-should-I-shift-to-another-technology

5,"The technology you're not familar with.  Anyone close to a field won't be surprised.  Which makes this a peculiar question, since the answer is both ""everything being developed"" and ""nothing"".For instance, I see someone has suggested mental control of machines.  But if you have a passing familiarity with the history of the field, you know that it's been happening for a long time, and the real problem is that we still have very little understanding of how the mind works.  Picking up signals is easy - even providing some sort of filter/classifier isn't hard.  This is all just engineering tweaks:The technology you're not familar with.

Picking up signals is easy - even providing some sort of filter/classifier isn't hard.  This is all just engineering tweaks: how do you make sufficiently low-impedence contact with the scalp, how do you digitize from many electrodes fast enough and with robust mobile hardware, how do you recognize the temporo-spatial patterns that are *deliberate* enough (and distinctive enough) to serve as control signals.We're practically no where when it comes to understanding the mind well enough to do more than fake it.  Just like we can ""fake it"" for voice recognition well enough to be sorta useful.The real question is when a field gets good enough at faking it to be practical.  That's almost more of a marketing question than a technical one.  Are electric vehicles good enough?  Fuel cells?  Cell phones?  ;)","1,594 followers",Michael Van In,631,1.5K,2.9M,2015,https://www.quora.com/I-m-interested-in-web-development-I-have-started-learning-Node-js-Is-Node-js-a-good-technology-for-web-development-or-should-I-shift-to-another-technology
