Once made redundant, they are the first in the firing line once the organization has to be ""streamlined"" ( jargon for downsizing).Ironically, employees are people who are customers and shareholders of other or their own organization. Laying them off is therefore the same as losing those customers since they will now have less money to spend and invest. This is not to mention the loss in goodwill which that person and his / her friends and family will credit to that organization.","68,790 followers",Kanthaswamy Balasubramaniam,898,17.3K,413.5M,2014,https://www.quora.com/How-can-anyone-have-a-sustainable-career-in-rapidly-advancing-technology

The pace of adoption will probably pick up over the next generation.2. Reducing man-hours is unintuitiveWorking long hours is a cultural and social issue rather than one determined by available technology, with different societies having different ideas and pressures. For example, I work for the London branch of a Korean company, and the difference in attitude between 'local' staff and 'expat' staff is telling - locals arrive around 9am and down tools and go home at 5pm unless they absolutely have to; expats generally work 7am - 7pm regardless of whether they actually have work to do (my friends who work in the Motherland itself often report working even later into the night even with nothing to do, and/or coming on on weekends - cf.All this despite reams of research strongly suggesting that working longer hours is actuallyBut it's intuitive: more people working more hours means more work gets done = profit. Would you want to be the executive suggesting that you could improve performance by reducing working hours? Would you want to be the trailblazing staff member who goes home on time when everyone else is still - seemingly - hard at work?In many places the direct and competitive pressures are being reduced, slowly and falteringly, more because of government initiatives and workers' rights movements than because man-hours can be directly replaced with automation.Technology doesn't really come into it - yet.",UNKNOWN,DurgaPrasad (దుర్గా ప్రసాద్),546,183,3.5M,2016,https://www.quora.com/How-can-anyone-have-a-sustainable-career-in-rapidly-advancing-technology
4,"OK, let’s start with this: automationNow it’s a tiny fraction. The tractor, combine, and other forms of automation destroyed a huge number of jobs. Around 1975, there were vast numbers of factory jobs. Since then, manufacturing output has much more than doubled, but manufacturing employment has fallen off a cliff.Some jobs were lost to offshoring, but most were destroyed by automation (which is why production is still rising).So automation does destroy jobs. But whaOK, let’s start with this: automationNow it’s a tiny fraction. The tractor, combine, and other forms of automation destroyed a huge number of jobs. Around 1975, there were vast numbers of factory jobs. Since then, manufacturing output has much more than doubled, but manufacturing employment has fallen off a cliff.Some jobs were lost to offshoring, but most were destroyed by automation (which is why production is still rising).So automation does destroy jobs. But what about all the new jobs it creates? There are some, of course, but not many. How many jobs do you think were created producing, selling, and servicing tractors, combines, etc? Eighty percent of all US jobs, to replace the farming jobs they have destroyed? How many jobs do you think were created producing, selling, and servicing robots and other factory automation technology since 1975? As many as the 8 million they destroyed? Not even close, which makes sense if you think about it. If automation created as many jobs as it destroyed, it wouldn’t save business money, so they wouldn’t do it.OK, so if automation destroys more jobs than it produces, then why is unemployment at multi-decade lows? Clearly lots of new jobsBut if new jobs are created, who cares whether they’re created by automation or not? The distinction is important because if the companies were able to use automation to produce the extra stuff they want to sell, then the new jobs wouldn’t be created. Automation doesn’t create jobs, it creates demand; if the demand can be filled without creating jobs, that’s what will happen.There’s a second problem. Often people whose jobs are destroyed never find another job. Younger people come along to take the new jobs created, because the new jobs require skills the people who lost their jobs don’t have. So while unemployment is at multi-decade lows, part of that is because after a certain number of weeks of unemployment, people are no longer counted as unemployed, but that doesn’t mean they have work. In fact, the proportion of Americans over 16 who are employed is also at multi-decade lows.So the new work that needs to be done may be done by robots, and even if it’s done by humans, it may need skills that the people who’ve lost their jobs don’t have, and may never be able to acquire. We could have strong demand for workers and still many people who can’t find jobs.Furthermore, there’s an ongoing shift in the kind of automation that’s going on. Up until a decade ago, most of the work that was automated was just repetitive physical tasks. Now Artificial Intelligence technology is starting to be deployed, allowing more sophisticated tasks to be automated. We already have financial reports and sports stories being written by computers, and computers are able to do legal discovery much faster and more reliably than paralegals, andComputers are going to continue to advance, increasingly taking over tasks that require intelligence and judgement, and people are not getting any more powerful. If this trend continues, and there’s no indication that it will not, increasing numbers of people will be incapable of learning skills that make them competitive with computers.So why am I advancing such an anti-automation idea? I’m not. Far from it: this is excellent news. Would you like to be a farm laborer, cutting grain all day with a scythe? I sure wouldn’t. I’m delighted those jobs were automated: I get to eat grain without having to cut it myself. I get to have fancy gadgets like the one I’m typing this on without having to work in a factory. Automation is an awesome thing.There’s just one catch. Kind of obvious, really. If automation replaces most jobs, then how will we live? The companies will have robots building all this wonderful stuff, as much stuff as we could want, but only company owners will be able to buy it. Right now our economy works because businesses need to hire workers to produce their goods and services, and pay those workers, who spend that money to buy the stuff the companies produce. Without workers, the companies earn all the money, and don’t spend it, so the money stops circulating.When this starts actually happening, you can expect to see workers earning a decreasing share of the national income, with businesses retaining more. In fact, that’s well under way already. In the early 1960s, workers took home more than 67% of national income. By 1997 it had fallen below 62%; in 2001 it had recovered to 65%, but since then it has fallen to 59%. The trend is downward and accelerating.So the problem is not automation. Companies can produce an abundance of everything we want, and more automation means more ability to produce. The problem is that our economy cannot distribute that production without people working to earn their share. We’re going to need to think of another way to distribute that production. Right now the best we have to turn to is our social welfare system, which doesn’t do very well and doesn’t look likely to scale to ongoing mass unemployment.

There are very, very few people who know how to make a barrel left in the world and fewer every year, yet barrel making was an advanced technology that changed the entire world for literally thousands of years.Incidentally. the most prolific barrel in the world today is the ASB or American Standard Barrel that hold 53 gallons because America makes more barrels than anyone else in the world. Many used Jack Daniels barrels are re-used to make other kinds of liquor in other parts of the world.Do you know who the highest paid man in the community was in “ancient times”? It was the Wheelwright.Making a wheel from wood with an axle that attaches to a cart and doesn’t fall apart within a mile or two is one of the most “advanced technologies” of all time. Without it, most civilizations would have failed or failed to spread. Cart wheels are complex and the forces must play against each other continuously to hold the wheel together as it rolls. A Cartwright made as much then as a jet airline pilot back does today. In the 1880s when the average wage was $1.50 a day, the Wheelwright was making 90 dollars a week. On the Mayflower they brought one single cart over to America and it was the most valuable thing on the ship manifest, worth more than 10 times the next most valuable thing on the ship. Can you make a cartwheel?

Sites such as this exist all over the world, South America has huge numbers of such megalithic construction sites. Yes brute force and plain stubborn determination can and does explain a lot.

These really should have been kept alive as they are such useful things, but were rediscovered MUCH later in history.Longest: fibreglass being invented in 1950 CE.The team that reproduced this half-scale reproduction craft, from a fresco in Thera (Santorini) believed flax linen cloth was used, held in a pine resin matrix infused with limestone powders to skin the outer hull over a wooden frame (that may have been applied internally too according to one of the ships in the fresco).This is not unreasonable, Minoans used composites for shields (leather/wicker) and in building structures too, they are the material scientists and engineers of the ancient world, they also produced fine cloths for export inventing murex purple.Flax linen cloth is almost as strong in tension as fibreglass. All things considered, I think there is a good possibility that this was a technology the Minoans used. The limited literary sources seem to refer to white bulls which may be the name that was applied to the ships that charged across the sea, I also note that the ship Theseus returned in was kept in Athens for many generations (until it decayed) which implies that it was not a normal ship but a prize as it may show how Minoan shipyards constructed these hulls, in any event, no other civilisation seems to be able to construct these hulls and may have remained a secret of Minoan shipyards, likely controlled by the Palace.This example is the most speculative, an ancient technology which is potentially used before 1628BCE using natural materials as composites, that would not be ‘invented’ until 1950 using glass-fiber.Minoan hydro works are considered to be comparable with those in Europe of the 18th century. They include cisterns, channels directly through hills, aqueducts, freshwater to dwelling (including volcanic hot water at Akrotiri, Thera), sealed interlocking clay pipes and an early form of concrete (using clay as the binder with pumice but no modified lime), upstairs toilets, sewers, and fountains for natural cooling.Prisms made from precision ground rock-crystal were found in Idaean mountain workshops, ca 1500BCE, the lens found (below) in a nearby cave are dated to 1350BCE, but this maybe when they are stored in the cave. The wedge crescent-shaped example will reproduce a rainbow. Prisms are more generally considered to be created around the time of Newton, 1500CE, not 1500BCE.A number of rooms have been identified in Palaces known as light and dark rooms, it appears that the Minoans were also splitting light into its spectrum and studying its properties. Having looked at there technologies in some detail, their optics are particularly good, they use simple techniques to achieve some rather interesting results, for example using water bowls to study the passage of Venus in front of the Sun in the soft reflection. It is as if they know what they want to achieve and possibly task workshops that utilise natural materials or a simple arrangement which will give them a new capability. There understanding of astronomy and the solar system is likely on a par with that of the time of Newton, by example, they have articulated all the periods that the Antikythera mechanism will use over a millennium later. Technically they are very accomplished for the time.OK, these are specific technologies that do seem to fall out of use in later periods and particularly around bronze age collapse. One slightly speculative example is comparable with fibreglass invented in 1950, the others are around the time of the European renaissance and industrial revolution. What this shows is the Minoans were rather advanced for their time, wealthy - all of these technologies require a considerable resource to produce, but had no technology which eclipses that of today.

However, I am not qualified to answer whether such technologies will ever be possible, so I will not venture a guess.",3 followers,Steve Baker,556,27.4K,163.3M,2011,https://www.quora.com/Why-are-most-job-hours-so-long-despite-the-advanced-technology-and-automation-today

19,"Your question is based upon a false assumption.  It is the equivalent of asking why phones are such a slow-changing technology because we still have to speak into a microphone while listening through a speaker.  Your calls still go through exchanges, still rely on cables for transmission, and still get cut off in the middle of a conversation.While you may not realize it, cars are enormously more sophisticated than they were 100 years ago.  Modern cars use more than 100 million lines of software code (your phone: maybe one million, the latest US F-35 Joint Strike Fighter: 5.7 million ).

It is the equivalent of asking why phones are such a slow-changing technology because we still have to speak into a microphone while listening through a speaker.  Your calls still go through exchanges, still rely on cables for transmission, and still get cut off in the middle of a conversation.While you may not realize it, cars are enormously more sophisticated than they were 100 years ago.  Modern cars use more than 100 million lines of software code (your phone: maybe one million, the latest US F-35 Joint Strike Fighter: 5.7 million ).  Tires have gone from rubber hoops to complex layered constructions of highly engineered materials designed to adhere to the road under all kinds of conditions.  Internal combustion engines deliver far more power with far less noise, lower fuel consumption, and fewer pollutant emissions.  In an accident, you are 25 times less likely to be killed because vehicles are designed to absorb crash energy while seat belts with electronic pretensioners pull you into your seat and airbags deploy in a fraction of a second.  In fact, everything inside the passenger compartment has been redesigned over the years to perform better in accidents in order to keep you alive.Cars do not throw in all kinds of gadgets visible to drivers because driving is a complex task.  If you need a few weeks to figure out all the new features of your phone, that's not a big problem.  It's even part of the fun.  Build a car that takes two weeks to figure out and people are going to die because of it.  Some 80% of accidents occur within three seconds of the driver becoming distracted by something other than the road ahead.  Some 94% of all accidents occur because the driver is not paying attention, makes a mistake, is drunk, or worse.Your phone, computer, TV locks up?  Pull the battery, unplug the cord, reboot.  Not really acceptable for a car at 40 mph in heavy traffic.So the fact is that cars are enormously more advanced than they were 100 years ago and enormously more complex than smart phones, HDTV, or bluetooth.  But you don't see it because every advance in technology has to be integrated in the least disruptive ways to avoid confusing drivers.  Otherwise, people die.And I would also note that we have electric vehicles, hydrogen-fueled vehicles, automated vehicles, and eventually self-driving vehicles.  The main thing holding back many of these advances has been lack of infrastructure (say, hydrogen filling stations) outside the control of the automakers and consumer preferences for high levels of convenience (and so doubts about electric vehicle range, ability to refuel at any street corner, etc.).",UNKNOWN,Julian Barkway,587,663,844.6K,2016,https://www.quora.com/How-can-anyone-have-a-sustainable-career-in-rapidly-advancing-technology

Think about satellite radio, internet access, live traffic, concierge services, automated aircon with 4 zones, ABS, EBD, traction control, air bags, crumble zones.Also think of the efficiency of engines. Manufacturers downsizing engines whilst increasing efficiency. In 1966, a Lamborghini Miura used a 3.9l V12 to produce 260kw, an A45 AMG Mercede makes 280kw from a 2.0l 4 cylinder. In 1908, the Ford Model T made 15kw from its 2.9l 4 pot...These are but the iceberg of all the advancements. I think car manufacturers are doing an amicable job of using what is available in their industry.","5,990 followers",Jens Böttiger,566,2.6K,17.6M,2016,https://www.quora.com/How-can-anyone-have-a-sustainable-career-in-rapidly-advancing-technology
