2,"As the late Douglas Adams pointed out: “Space is big. Really big. You just won't believe how vastly, hugely, mind-bogglingly big it is.”So here is the thing: in the Oort cloud, the average distance between comets is estimated around 16 astronomical units (AU). That is, 16 times the distance between the Earth and the Sun. So that’s one comet every 2.4 billion kilometers.And comets, of course, are pretty small. The nucleus of a comet has a diameter of 10 km or so. That’s less than 0.1% the diameter of the Earth.By way of comparison… imagine reducing a comet to the size of a golf ball.

Now fire a bullet randomly at the combined Eurasian/African land mass. What are the odds that your bullet will hit the golf ball?That’s how unlikely it is for the Voyagers to hit an Oort cloud comet on their way out of the solar system.","1,764 followers",Jeffrey Naujok,566,254,2.5M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-new-technologies-will-need-to-be-developed-to-make-Von-Neumann-probes-which-operate-in-the-Oort-Cloud-feasible

8,"I have no idea what this means. How do you measure “overtaking”? How do you know that your programming language has surpassed the hardware, or alternatively, how do you know the hardware has surpassed your programming language? Without a way to quantify this concept, the question is meaningless. Is there a cause-effect relationship? Does the introduction of incredibly fast processors mean that they have exceeded some language metric? Or is the enabling of languages like Python a side effect?

Since I consider hardware and software to be orthogonal axes, it is like asking “will increasing x give me a better y?”, which requires “Show me the formula for computing y from a given x”. Right now, we benefit from language improvement (along unmeasurable axes) and hardware improvement, so any give point in 2-space gets better, but is “better” actually measured in 3-space?

Malaysia didn’t.First, a little detour.Anyone recognize this man?Clue. This was taken in the 1920s.Perhaps a more recent shot will help.Deng Xiaoping was one of the student-workers sent to study Western culture and science in France. The hope was they will bring their learning and experience back to China and remake the nation to catch up with the West.What was the backdrop? In the 1920s, China was still in civil war. There was a nominal central government but the nation was in chaos until reunification in 1949.And yet the Chinese recognized the importance of youth and education, enough to privately invest astronomical sums (for a desperately poor semi-state) on several hundred young men and women. Unsurprisingly, many of them went on to write themselves into modern China’s history. Including two guys named Zhou Enlai and Deng Xiaoping.But what does this have to do with Malaysia?Malaysia is resource rich. Fantastically so, considering the population density at independence. When oil turned into liquid gold during the 1970s (the price went from $3 to $40 before the end of the decade), the bonanza helped fund the NEP. Generations of leaders pursued race-based social engineering funded by easy money to ensure political succession at the polls rather than lay the groundwork to build her up.What happens when things are cheap? People become wasteful. Take Proton, the first indigenous car, a symbol of Malay pride and technological achievement. How old is Proton? Started in 1983, which makes her almost 40. Yet she has little to boast about. She still makes cars even Malaysians—particularly Federal and state officials—don’t want to buy. Or take MAS, bleeding red year on year and kept on life support by the government.I can go on but you get the picture. The development path Malaysia chose did not emphasize learning from the world to become strong and catching up with advanced economies.I find it instructive to include this recollection from a famous Malaysian:> I made one—and only one—strong attempt to influence the course of history of Malaysia. This took place in September 1975 during the Muslim fasting month. Tun Razak, the second Prime Minister of Malaysia, was gravely ill with terminal leukaemia, for which he was receiving treatment in a London hospital. My dear friend Hussein Onn, son of Dato Onn bin Jafar, was Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Finance and acting Prime Minister in Tun Razak’s absence. He was soon to become Malaysia’s third Prime Minister. I went to Kuala Lumpur and sent word that I wanted to have a heart-to-heart talk. On the phone Hussein said, “Why don’t you come in during lunch time. It is the fasting month. Come to my office at about half past one. There will be no one around and we can chat to our heart’s content.”Hussein and I go back to 1932 when we were in the same class in school in Johor Bahru. Shortly afterwards, his father fell out with the then-Sultan of Johor and the family moved to the Siglap area of Singapore.My father would often spend weekends with Dato Onn. Two or three years later, Hussein returned to Johor Bahru and we were classmates again at English College from 1935 to 1939. Hussein’s father, Dato Onn, did not have a tertiary education. But he read widely and was very well informed. He was a natural born politician, a gifted orator in Malay and in English. He was a very shrewd man with a tremendous air of fine breeding even though he was not from Malaysian royalty. When you were in his presence, you knew you were in the presence of someone great. Dato Onn would go on to found UMNO, the ruling party of Malaysia, and become one of the founders of the independent nation of Malaysia. He set a tone of racial harmony for the nation—and he practised it. Our families were close.So, I went to call on his son, my old friend Hussein Onn in 1975. His office was in a magnificent old colonial building, part of the Selangor Secretariat Building. In front of it was the Kuala Lumpur padang, where, in the colonial days, the British used to play the gentlemen’s games of cricket and rugby. I climbed up a winding staircase and his aide showed me straight to his room. There was hardly another soul in that huge office complex. After greeting one another, I warmed up to my subject with Hussein very quickly. I said, “Hussein, I have come to discuss two things with you. One is Tun Razak’s health. The other is the future of our nation.” I said, “You know, Razak has been looking very poorly lately. We all know he has gone to London for treatment.” Hussein interrupted: “Tun doesn’t like anybody discussing his health. Do you mind if we pass on to the next subject?” I said, “Of course not.” I continued, “I had to raise the first subject because that leads to the next subject. Assuming Razak doesn’t have long to live—please don’t mind, but I have to say that—you are clearly going to become the new Prime Minister in a matter of months or weeks.”“I’m listening,” he said. “Hussein, we go back a long way. Our fathers were the best of friends; our families have been the best of friends. In our young days, you and I always felt a strong passion for our country, which we both still feel. Whatever has happened these past years, let’s not go backwards and ask what has gone wrong and what has not been done right. Let’s look at the future. If there was damage done, we can repair it.”Hussein listened patiently. I pressed on, “First, let me ask you a few questions, Hussein. What, in your mind, is the number of people required to run a society, a community, a nation with the land mass of Malaysia?” This was 1975, when the population was about 12.5 million. He didn’t reply. For the sake of time, I answered my own question. “Hussein, if I say 3,000, if I say 6,000, if I say 10,000, 20,000, whatever the figure, I don’t think it really matters. We are not talking in terms of hundreds of thousands or millions. To run a society or a nation requires, relatively speaking, a handful of people. So let us say six or seven or eight thousand, Hussein. And of course this covers two sectors. The public sector: government, civil service, governmental organisations, quasi-governmental bodies, executive arms, police, customs and military. The private sector: the economic engines; the engines of development, plantations, mines, industry.“The leaders of these two sectors are the people I am referring to, Hussein. If we are talking of a few thousand, does it matter to the masses whether it becomes a case of racially proportionate representation, where we must have for every ten such leaders five or six Malays, three Chinese, and one or two Indians?” I continued, “Must it be so? My reasoning mind tells me that it is not important. What is important is the objective of building up a very strong, very modern nation. And for that we need talented leaders, great leadership from these thousands of people. If you share my view that racial representation is unimportant and unnecessary to the nation, then let’s look at defining the qualifications for those leaders.“Number one, for every man or woman, the first qualification is integrity. The person must be so clean, upright and honest that there must never be a whiff of corruption or scandal. People do stray, and, when that happens, they must be eliminated, but on the day of selection they must be people of the highest integrity. Second, there must be ability; and with it comes capability. He or she must be a very able and capable person. The third criterion is that they must be hard-working men or women, people who are willing to work long hours every day, week after week, month after month, year after year. That is the only way you can build up a nation.”I went on, “I can’t think of any other important qualifications. So your job as prime minister, Hussein—I am now assuming you will become the prime minister—your job will then be from time to time to remove the square pegs from the round holes, and to look for square holes for square pegs and round holes for round pegs. Even candidates who fulfil those three qualifications can be slotted into the wrong jobs. So you’ve got to pull them out and re-slot them until the nation is humming beautifully.”“We do not have all the expertise required to build up the nation,” I added. “But with hard work and a goal of developing the nation, we can afford to employ the best people in the world. The best brains will come, in all shades and colours, all religions, all faiths. They may be the whitest of the white, the brownest of the brown or the blackest of the black. I am sure it doesn’t matter. But Hussein, the foreigners must never settle in the driving seats. The days of colonialism are over. They were in the driving seats and they drove our country helter-skelter.

Fun facts: Upon completion in 1966, the Tugu Negara is the world’s tallest bronze freestanding sculpture grouping, until today. The monument is 15 meters (49.21 feet) tall, made of bronze and was designed byAccording to the wikipedia definition, a developed country is a country that has a high quality of life, developed economy, and advanced technological infrastructure relative to other less industrialized nations. Normally, the criteria for evaluating the degree of economic development are GDP, GNP, the per capita income, level of industrialization, amount of widespread infrastructure and general standard of living.Now, there are 11 countries in South East Asia. None can be considered a developed nation. Not even Singapore. Maybe a highly-developed developing country, but not yet a developed country. For those of you who doesn’t know (or too lazy to google) what are the 11 countries, below is the list (based on land area and population):Largest country is Indonesia, smallest is Singapore. Indonesia also is the most populous with 273.5 million people, and Brunei Darussalam is the least populous with only 400,000 souls. Timor Leste is the youngest brother.GDP per capitaAs I was saying before, normally people measure the development of a nation by looking at its GDP per capita, which is basically a nation’s income divided by its population. Based on latest GDP per capita:Average GDP per capita for South East Asia is USD5,045. Only 4 of 11 countries are above average, which is Brunei, Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand. The poorest nation is Myanmar. Some economists consider a developed nation must at least have USD12,000-15,000 per capita income. Some considered USD25,000-30,000 per capita income as the lowest threshold. By this definition alone, looks like only Brunei and Singapore are qualified as developed nations. But, is Brunei a developed nation? Is Singapore? We cannot compare a 400,000 population of Brunei or 5.8mil population of Singapore to huge 273.5mil people of Indonesia, or 109.5mil people of Philippines. Its like comparing apple to durian. Indonesia is a trillion income country, but it has 4th largest population as well. So to see just GDP per capita is not accurate enough to determine who is more developed than the other. We need to look into other criteria as well, level of industrialization, level of infrastructure, and standards of living.SkyscappersWhat reflects a developed, modern country if not the skyscrappers. United States, the most modern country in the world, has been the home for the tallest skyscrappers since late 19th century until 1998. More than a hundred years. City like New York and Chicago are full of skyscrappers. Skyscrappers are the symbol of wealth and economic prosperity of a nation.Petronas Twin Towers.

And The Exchange 106 at no. 24. Malaysia have 4 of the top 25 tallest buildings in the world. This is huge statement in terms of technology, development and economic power. Singapore has none. Indonesia has none. Thailand has none. Philippines has none. Vietnam has one. Malaysia even have more skyscrappers in the top 25 than USA itself.Merdeka 118, Kuala Lumpur.

Vietnam with 40,000km of road network. Indonesia with 283,000km. Malaysia with 290,000km of paved roads. Thailand has largest road network in South East Asia with 390,000km.Sub-category Bridges over waterOne of the technology marvels is bridge. Eventhough Brunei not in the top 5 countries, it is worth to mention that Temburong Bridge in Brunei is currently the longest in South East Asia with 30km. 2nd longest is Sultan Abdul Halim Bridge (Penang 2nd Bridge) with 24km. 3rd longest is Penang Bridge at 13.5km.

Fun facts: Upon completion in 1985, Penang Bridge is the 6th longest road bridge in the world. The first outside continental US, and the longest in Asia.Sub-category TunnelsIt is worth to mention that Kuala Lumpur has a unique tunnel called SMART tunnel. It is a dual-purpose tunnel as road tunnel and water drainage tunnel. At 11.5km, the SMART tunnel is the longest drainage tunnel in South East Asia and 2nd in Asia. It is a dual-deck, with 4km of road tunnel, and regarded as top ten of the worlds greatest tunnels.SMART Tunnel. Fun facts: The acronym SMART is stands for Stormwater Management and Road Tunnel. Upon completion, it is the world’s first dual-function tunnel.Railway NetworkSingapore has 253km of tracks. All electrified and metro lines. Malaysia has 1833km of railway tracks with 767km of double-track and electrified, mostly in Peninsular Malaysia. Vietnam has 2600km of tracks. Thailand has 4346km of tracks with 168km of electrification. Indonesia has the largest railway network with 6600km of tracks and 478km of electrification.Waterways NetworkSingapore has no waterways. Thailand has 3,900km. Malaysia has 7,200km. Vietnam has 17,000km. Indonesia has the largest waterway networks with 21,000km.Pipelines NetworkNo data for Singapore. Vietnam has about 1000km of energy piping networks. Thailand has 1,889km of pipelines. Malaysia has 2,100km of pipelines. Indonesia, again, has vast pipelines network of 20,000km. Largest in SEA.Air Networks (including air force base)Being a city-state, Singapore has only 5 airports. Vietnam has 37 airports. Malaysia has 38 airports. Thailand has 59 airports. Indonesia has astounding 186 airports, to cover for transportation between the vast achipelago.Sub-category Busiest AirportsThere is another sub-category for air networks, which is airports rating itself. The number of passengers handled and service provided. Based on 2019 data (pre covid-19 era), Changi is at no. 18 in the world with 68.4mil passenger. Suvarnabhumi is at no. 19 with 65.4mil passengers. KLIA is at no. 21 with 62.3mil passengers. Soekarto-Hatta is at no. 24 with 55.8mil passengers. Ninoy Aquino is at no 39 with 47.8mil passengers. Singapore are ahead, with Thailand and Malaysia are closely behind. Need to mention that Bangkok has two major international airports, and the other one is Don Mueang which handles 41.3mil passengers, with a total of 106.7mil passengers in 2019.Changi Airport, Singapore. Fun facts: Holders of World Best Airport for 8 continuous years.Changi Airport has won best airport of the year for multiple times from Skytrax in the top 100 best airports, and currently hold the record for 8 consecutive years as world best airports. In 2021, Changi is at no. 3, Soekarto-Hatta is at no. 34, KLIA is at no. 55, Suvarnabhumi is at no. 66. Denpasar is at no. 82. Vietnam has no representative at world 100 best airports.Sea NetworksSingapore has one port, which is Singapore port. Thailand has 9 major ports. Indonesia also have 9 major ports. Vietnam has 11 major ports. Malaysia has 21 major ports.Even though Singapore has only one port, Singapore is among the busiest container ports in the world in 2019. Ranking at no. 2 in the world, handling 36.6mil TEUs. Port Klang, Malaysia is at no. 12 with 13.6mil TEUs. Port of Tanjung Pelepas, Malaysia is at no. 18 with 9.1mil TEUs. Laem Chabang, Thailand is at no. 21 with 8,.1mil TEUs. Tanjong Priok, Indonesia is at no. 22 with 7.6mil TEUs. Saigon, Vietnam is at no. 25 with 7.2mil TEUs.Vehicles per capita (excluding 2 wheels)Motorcycle per capitaVietnam is leading the world in 2-wheels vehicle on the road. This is not a positive criteria for a developed nation as this vehicle considered as moped or small-cc motorcycle. Unlike the west who owned high power motorcycle. However, this is included more as a fun facts.This shows that South East Asian countries are huge market for small-engine motorcycles.ConclusionBased on above data, we can deduce each country’s strength. To say Malaysia is less developed from other SEA countries is totally wrong. Based on facts and figures in this article, Malaysia stands tall among other more developed nation of the west. There are still few categories and criteria that has not been mentioned yet.

14,"None, probably. Things generally get safer with progress. Even nuclear weapons caused less wars to happen. I welcome all the nasty weapons provided they will never be used. I think internet already helped a lot for people to understand each other more, wars are therefore further unlikely. Internet was another example of military technology.Recreational drugs are exception, they will get more dangerous, and antidepressants etc. Only change in society for better can mitigate that, by helping people not to be suicidal or depressed, not the other way around.",2 followers,Tom Matthews,2.3K,961,1.1M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-new-technologies-will-need-to-be-developed-to-make-Von-Neumann-probes-which-operate-in-the-Oort-Cloud-feasible
15,"It depends.What (exactly) do you mean by “develops?”The argument about electricity illustrates my concern about the use of the word.When A/C first became a working standard (largely because of its superior transmission properties), it was VERY dangerous.Since then a number of innovations in circuit breaker design have made it considerably less so — AFI and GFI being the two most notable examples.In more recent years innovations have been put forward to add extra safety measures that can trigger breakers when people interrupt A/C with body parts.You see, flesh has a rather peculiar ohmic signatIt depends.What (exactly) do you mean by “develops?”The argument about electricity illustrates my concern about the use of the word.When A/C first became a working standard (largely because of its superior transmission properties), it was VERY dangerous.Since then a number of innovations in circuit breaker design have made it considerably less so — AFI and GFI being the two most notable examples.In more recent years innovations have been put forward to add extra safety measures that can trigger breakers when people interrupt A/C with body parts.You see, flesh has a rather peculiar ohmic signature — partly due to its water content, partly due to its dilute saline nature, and partly due to its largely carbon content. Consider us as “squishy” resistors if you will.This would not require much — just a slightly more sensitive GFI breaker would probably work.D/C safety measures have lagged behind, although I would argue that this is only due to lack of market pressure.Training people with respect to current safety precautions (I.e. keeping one hand in your pocket when working with large batteries or direct-current bus bars) has kept D/C deaths down.I’ve been shocked by both kinds of current more times than I can remember, but as an electrical engineer I have slavishly followed all the safety precautions at my disposal, so none of these “educational” experiences killed me outright.If anything, it underlined the importance of observing safe design practices — almost all my “gotchas” were due to someone else’s stupidity.(Improper grounding, illegal house wiring practices and so on were responsible for a lot of them).I suspect the gentleman who bemoaned the dangers of genetic innovation may be unaware of a lot of changes already introduced to make the science safer, as in mixing traits in organisms which can’t survive outside a controlled lab environment. This is a new technology — more will come.Where most of the problems will arise I suspect is when folks deliberately set out to circumvent safety protocols because it’s cheaper, faster, easier, bypasses tedious oversight procedures, and so forth.In the great Game of Life, nothing trumps stupidity.","9,893 followers",Kenzi Mudge,1.8K,1.3K,8.3M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-new-technologies-will-need-to-be-developed-to-make-Von-Neumann-probes-which-operate-in-the-Oort-Cloud-feasible
16,"London in 2017 had 116 murders.Detroit had 267 murders in 2017.London has a population of 8.9million peopleDetroit has a population of 673,000.In order for London to be as dangerous as Detroit per capita, it would need to increase its murder rate to 3,530.In 2019, the London homicide rate reached 149, which is the highest in over a decade. However if you compare this with the period 1990–2008, only 2 years (1996 and 1999) had a lower homicide rate than 149.Now it might seem unfair to use the whole of london, as it is vast, so let us look at Lambeth district, which is both the murder capital ofLondon in 2017 had 116 murders.Detroit had 267 murders in 2017.London has a population of 8.9million peopleDetroit has a population of 673,000.In order for London to be as dangerous as Detroit per capita, it would need to increase its murder rate to 3,530.In 2019, the London homicide rate reached 149, which is the highest in over a decade.

Lambeth racked up 154 homicides between 2000 and 2012, which by multiplying by 2.065 in order to adjust for the population difference, then dividing by 12 means the most murderous part of the most murderous city in the UK had an average homicide rate of 25.5 per year.The London borough with the lowest homicide rate, Kingston Upon Thames achieved 14 homicides over the same 12 year period, which by doing the maths to achieve the population of Detroit brings its total to 3.9 homicides per year.To sum up, if you live in the most murderous area of London you are still over 10x less likely to be murdered than in Detroit. If you live in the least murderous area of London, you are over 68x less likely to be murdered.So no - London is a long long way from being more dangerous than Detroit.","3,890 followers",Ricky Tack,776,28.1K,27.1M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-new-technologies-will-need-to-be-developed-to-make-Von-Neumann-probes-which-operate-in-the-Oort-Cloud-feasible

18,"Technology itself is not a danger. The potential danger lies in the fact that it’s being used to replace a natural ability, or to grant an ability that we never had, which we become dependent upon or use without caution. Potential dependence is a problem, unintended side-effects are another. It’s not so bad when you’re using it to do a thing that you can’t actually do yourself, but allowing some aspect of yourself to atrophy because technology replaced it is amazingly foolish.","1,594 followers",Michael Van In,631,1.5K,2.9M,2020,https://www.quora.com/How-will-developments-in-microprocessor-technology-affect-computer-science-education
