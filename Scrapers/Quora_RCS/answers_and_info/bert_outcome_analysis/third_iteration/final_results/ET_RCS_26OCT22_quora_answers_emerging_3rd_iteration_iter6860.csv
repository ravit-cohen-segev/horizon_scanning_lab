The thing is we have to take a look at the innards of a country to really know whether or not you are truly developed. That Chinese are so obsessed with portraying the facade that they are technologically advanced and ahead is actually an indication that they have not fully developed yet. Because fully developed countries have no need to show off things like that. Everyone knows they are developed.For example, here is San Francisco:Look, not many skyscrapers right? And look at those old cable cars going around! That must mean they are undeveloped right? Nope. Everyone knows San Francisco is a developed city. That’s why it has no need to show off with luxury skyscrapers and such things.Or how about Florence, Italy?Again, no skyscrapers here. But everyone knows it’s a developed city and Italy is a developed country.My point is, you have got to look at the people and the innards of a country to truly know if they are developed.This is the true face of China:You have got to look at the average person. Does the average Chinese have good access to healthcare (which is ranked near the bottom in WHO rankings btw)? Can they drink tap water safely? Do they have access to quality food? Do all have access to electricity or paved roads or a quality education? The answer is: probably, yes, if you are living in the rich east coast provinces of Jiangsu or Zhejiang or Guangdong- but not if you are living in say - Xinjiang or Gansu or Tibet. China’s wealth is not spread equally, neither is it developed equally. Even though the CCP has developed China quite fast - there is still a lot of work to be done making sure *every Chinese* have equal access to everything.And then you got to look at the attitude of the people. When I was in China I found that you really got to look out for who you trust, because there is a lot of scams going on all the time. You never know what is real, what is fake, what is real price of anything. Why do these scams exist? Because people have to be desperate to make money that’s why.Why are people desperate to make money? Probably because they are not making enough to survive, which is an indication that the country is still developing. You’ll notice that in general, the more developed a country is, the less likely there will be scams. In Korea/Japan/Taiwan, you will not find very many scams. In China and Eastern Europe it’s likely.Another aside I want to note is that Chinese bathrooms don’t contain any toilet paper. Do you know the reason why? It’s because people steal it. Now, in what developed country does this happen? I can’t think of any. Only in a developing country would you need to bring your own toilet paper to the bathroom because there isn’t any there due to fear of people stealing it.I find GDP/capita to be generally a pretty good indicator of how developed a country is. The average GDP/capita (PPP) of China is still around $8k/person. While that is higher than most Asian countries - it’s still below the 4 East Asian tigers + Japan and far from the $62k/person that the USA has.The true measure of a developed society is to observe the people that live in the country and not the appearance of the country itself. Chinese “face” culture is the same. You can just obviously see that China has developed really really fast, and mentality wise people are still harping about luxury products and consumerism - this is where Americans were back in the 50s, 60s and 70s, not now.The biggest consumers of luxury products are Chinese people, not Americans or Europeans. The more developed you are, the less need you have to validate your self worth with materialism. The less desire you have to spend thousands of dollars on your children's schooling just to send them to be educated abroad. The less need to travel to countries like Canada or USA for giving birth so that your child becomes a US or Canadian citizen, or to launder your money by buying up real estate in other countries. Developed countries do not need to do things like that.Thats why you should always pay attention to the old adage -Edit:Of course, Chinese commenters love to bring up the USA. Yes, USA has lots of impoverished areas too; every country has developed areas and undeveloped areas, however my point is that for China there is significantly more undeveloped areas at a higher % compared to the USA. The poverty rate for China is 16% as of 2019 and for USA it is 1.5% as of 2019.

They call it GPRe.I was in military R&D back in the late 1980s and met a guy at one of our R&D conferences. This one was at Los Alamos, NM, where we were briefed on what other services and research facilities were doing. He told me this story as sort of a joke on how some hardcore technology can be abused.He told me that it uses a very wide range of frequencies (20 Mhz up to 3 Ghz) in a rapid frequency-agile scan while also using a very narrow, high energy beam that is rapidly panned back and forth to build up a picture of what is under the ground or under the water. For water, this is supplemented by a laser that does the same thing. High energy blue-green polarized lasers in burst mode scans with high-resolution sensors of reflections give it a radar like capability in water.The innovation in the GPR came when they used sensor fusion technology and digital image analysis to integrate multiple emissions and energy collections into a single image. This is enhanced by using very high power in either beams or burst emissions that improve penetration and are collected and reassembled into an image.The first model built was fitted to a customized C-130. are rumors that it also uses some innovative modulations and high power burst modes as high as 800,000 watts or more. The equipment is able to do this because the aircraft turbojet engines have powerful generators on them and the burst mode is only for a fraction of a second. It was used in Iraq to hunt for buried WMDs and underground facilities. It was found to be remarkably effective. Not long after, NRL started working on a Navy version and added the lasers and more digital analysis of the collected fusion of data.GPR typically penetrates 30 to 50 feet depending on the soil. GPRe can go down to 120 feet in sand and dry non-metal soil and can get down as far as 50–60 feet in most everything else except wet metallic clay. Using the frequency-agile and narrow high energy beam laser, it can go down to 200+ feet in ocean water and over 300 feet in freshwater.During the middle east wars, the GPRe would ID an unusual object and then send out a team to investigate. They would dig it up to see if it was weapons. On several occasions, the object turned out to be some ancient, previously unknown artifact made of silver or gold. The Navy began finding outlines of ships that were later investigated and later found to be ancient shipwrecks or old WWII wrecks. A few of these proved to be ancient, previously unknown shipwrecks that contained made of silver or gold treasures.The word of the capabilities of the GPRe was briefed to various Congressmen and Senators. It wasn’t long before they all wanted to GPRe aircraft to fly over parts of their states and often over the property they personally owned or could acquire. While trying to keep the capabilities secret, the Congressmen were clamoring to get access to it. They went so far as to offer to pay for its use or to cut funding if they did not get it.It has been used to make some spectacular finds of ancient artifacts and treasures but they always build another plausible excuse of how it was found so that they can keep the GPRe use a secret. The only reason I can say anything about it is that it has been over 20 years since I heard this and my knowledge of it is way out of date. The limitations on secrets like this (evolving technology) usually expire after 20 years. Sensor fusion, frequency agility, phased-array emissions and maximum power in burst mode have all increased significantly since the 80s so I am sure this system is much more capable now.I am sure that the newest systems are much more capable and have been improved. It is only a rumor but I heard that they had added some sort of X-ray laser-beam kind of device to the sensor fusion, giving it higher penetration at greater resolution. It is still kept as a black project but it also is still being used by powerful and influential people for their personal gain.Bottom line is, when this starts being used for legitimate and serious exploration and archeology, we will be making some very interesting discoveries that are likely to redefine history.This is, of course, second-hand information. I did not personally ever see or work on these systems, so, I make no claims as to the authenticity of this story.

That's only a little true; lSome people worry about the trees we have to cut down, but paper towels are usually made from recycled wood pulp, and they don’t need the really nasty binders or bleaches. The related problem of paper waste can be solved if we just put a bit of effort in; paper towels are easily biodegradable and can be composted. By fitting paper towels into the middle of a recycling stream, we don't need to cut down any trees, and no trash has to go to a landfill.Long story short, paper towels are a clean, hygienic, and sustainable bathroom solution, and hand dryers are a completely unnecessary replacement that’s actively worse.I’m tired of having soggy hands for no good reason.2020 edit:",0 followers,James Owen,1.1K,0,0,2020,https://www.quora.com/Why-are-only-a-few-concentrates-on-developing-technology-that-will-develop-the-developing-countries
