But in order for this reform policy approach to work, people have to actually invest into their country, in other words, the sanctions have to be lifted.It’s possible North Korea might begin to recover, but western influence needs to die down and China has to push for more trade with North Korea. But the North Korean government also has to be more flexible and willing to use that trade to help its economy, and not repeat bad economic policies like in the 1970s that lead to a default.There is hope for North Korea, since the US is declining in global influence.The shrinking relevance of the US and the growing relevance of China will in the future allow for China to use its geopolitical influence to push for better trade relations with North Korea, and hopefully they have a good talk with the North Koreans to make sure they actually use that trade efficiently.Good news in this regard that came out only a few days ago.",UNKNOWN,Sandeep,666,112,709.9K,2017,https://www.quora.com/Where-does-North-Korea-get-its-advanced-technologies-It-took-the-USAs-scientists-and-engineers-decades-and-many-tens-of-billions-of-dollars-to-invent-technologies-that-North-Korea-comes-up-with-in-a-few-months
