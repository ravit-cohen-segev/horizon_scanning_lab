It’s a resource that’s part of the blockchain ecosystem.Remember those loyal worker bees I mentioned? The ones that authenticate your transactions and add it to the spreadsheet? Well, they have an incentive to do that for you - they win Bitcoins every time they successfully authenticate a transaction and add it to the spreadsheet.The thing is, it’s not easy to authenticate a transaction - those complex mathematical algorithms make it difficult. So, these worker bees compete with each other to see who can solve the authentication “puzzle” first so that they can win the prize - some valuable bitcoins!This is a simplified version of how the blockchain works. If you’re interested, you can read the technical one I’m about to write, or skip ahead to the way blockchain will revolutionize the economy.The technical explanationA blockchain is a continuously growing list of records or “blocks” that are linked and secured with eachother (forming a chain) using a technique calledThe blockchain was invented by a man named Satashi Nakamoto to serve as a public transaction ledger for the bitcoin. Yep, it all started with the bitcoin.To be used as a distributed ledger, the blockchain is operated through aEach block contains specific data :A hash is a long number that acts as aThose “worker bees” I mentioned before? They’re actually calledA function they use to generate the current hash uses the previous hash, the data in the block, and some other parameters as its inputs. Because the function’s output depends on the previous hash to generate the current hash, all the blocks are linked or “chained” to each other.Since the function is deterministic (it gives the same output for a given input) , is one-one, and uses the previous block’s hash, corrupting data in the block would result inThe thing is, it’s difficult to find the current block’s hash because the network accepts only a very small range, a very small subset of the possible hashes that can be generated (the more the miners on the network, the smaller the accepted range.)But wait a minute - the block number is fixed, the previous block’s hash is fixed, and the transaction data is fixed, so wouldn’t the function always generate the same hash?Well, one - the transaction data is not fixed. A block can only be generated every 10 minutes (a rule to control the circulation of bitcoins), so the transactions that occur over this 10 minute period sit in this place called aAlong with this one variable, there are more - the timestamp, and a number called aSo, it’s a basically a fight between the miners to find the acceptable hash for the current block such that the particular subset of transactions they choose are authenticated successfully. This incentivized cryptocurrency fueled mechanism powers the blockchain.In this manner, miners continuously add blocks to the blockchain, authenticating transactions on this distributed, open ledger.The ledger can even be programmed to initiate transactions automatically through “The impact - what’s the blockchain going to do?The blockchain is considered a foundational technology because it has the potential to createHow?I think it’s clear that the Blockchain is the way of the future - revolutionizing the way we transact and in the process disrupting several industries - the financial sector, health, media, insurance, banking, etc - and possibly even blending well with technologies like Internet of Things and A.I.It’s in your hands to be part of this revolution.

To answer the questionThe Problem of unemployment is not only with Mechanical Engineers, but with the whole Industrial Sector.A lot of Electrical Engineers and Electronics Engineers are working in IT Services like TCS, Infosys, Wipro, CTS, IBM etc.Many Civil and Mechanical Engineers are either working in Banking Services or pursuing Teaching in Coaching Classes.Some are selling Credit CardsFortunate Ones are going to US, Germany, Netherland to pursue M.S.The reason for this is, after Independence Indian economy has shifted gradually from Agriculture Sector to Service Sector (be it formal or Informal) leavingAccordingly the Share of Workforce in the Industrial Sector also remained Stagnant.However, Total no of Engineering graduates each year has risen drastically leaving many graduates unemployed.As per National Employability report engineers annual report 2019, Approximately 80 percent of Indian engineering graduates are not employable in the current knowledge-driven economy. This signify the pathetic condition of engineering education in India. Some major initiative in the direction of quality of education, is the need of the hour.What are Future Prospects of Industrial SectorIt has already been perceived our Government that Industrial & Manufacturing growth is the best route for overall economic development.Make In India, Skill Development, Start-up India, Stand-up India, Entrepreneurship Skill Development Program are some of the examples.Under Make in India thrust sectors have been identified to provide a push to manufacturing and Start-up India to strengthen the start-up ecosystem.The Ease of Doing Business initiative aims to create a conducive environment by streamlining existing regulations and processes and eliminating unnecessary requirements and procedures.Foreign Direct Investment policy and procedures have been simplified and liberalised progressively.Hope Future Industrial Sector is Bright, Everyone will be Employed !.Thank you Ayana Vini for pointing this out..Edit-2.0For people contending that the rate of innovation in Computer Science and Electronics is much higher and there is very less innovation in Mechanical engineering.I agree that the rate of innovation in computer science and electronics is far than the mechanical engineering.I totally agree.However, There is a world beyond the computer too. We can not eat data, we can not wear motherboard and we can not brush our teeth with a transistor & we can not drive a mouse.What i mean to say that for the innovations in computer science and electronics to use practically we always have to have a base. Where will we use those innovations ?? We will use these innovation in electronics over a car, or robot, or drone or rocket or spaceship or aeroplane , helicopter, fighter plane or any other equipment which must have a chance of using Mechanical engineering and we can witness the innovations in these technologies, can’t we?The rate of innovations in computer science and electronics is higher because these are new for the humanity. Both came into existence in the later 20th century and innovation has just picked up in the last decade. Hence, everything is new for us and we are able to perceive the little changes in it. Like after every 6 months we see a new smart phone with some new technology. There are millions of Applications releasing everyday. It looks quite fascinating to us, isn’t it ?However, we have been unable to see the innovations in materials. We don’t know about carbon fiber. We have ignored these innovations in Biomechanics.AWe have no idea about innovation in the field of Fluid dynamics because we can not feel it.There are innovations in mechanical Engineering too.The world is dreaming about a flying car, an smart robot, smart machines, and smart materials.There are huge innovation in nanotechnology, robotics, biomechanics going on.And i hope that in the NEXT EPIDEMIC like CORONA virus our worriers will be smart robots equipped with artificial intelligence ( off course credit goes to computer science), who will be carrying the infected to the hospitals and operating them.And in the coming time biotechnology is going to take over both Computer Science and Electronics Engineering as world has started witnessing biological warfare.Where as Mechanical Engineering will keep growing with the slow pace like a tortoise!Regards,ReferenceImage Source -phone gallery & GoogleMechanical engineering - Wikipedia4 Things to Expect for the Future of Mechanical Engineeringhttps://www.gedcouncil.org/sites/default/files/Engineering+Education+in+India+Dec1608-1.pdfDATA STORY | 80% of Indian engineering graduates not employable, says surveyIndia struggles but Bangladesh's GDP rides high on manufacturing, export boomKey Initiatives for Industrial Development Post GST and Demonetisation",420 followers,Bikramjit B,595,51,428.1K,2020,https://www.quora.com/Which-emerging-technologies-are-people-the-least-familiar-with-but-will-have-the-largest-impact

Such economic power don't go away easily. After war, Germany was rebuilt with the help of Marshall plan and was tightly integrated with rest of European economy through EEC and EU.As US and Germany took away its industrial superiority in the late 19th century, UK's economy started a slow slide and by the first world war its economy was weak, living on borrowed money from the US. After the second world war, it lost most of its colonies - on whose back a sizable chunk of the wealth was made - and its economy was not as well integrated with Europe's as Germany's. While Thatcher brought some reforms to get the economy back on track in the late 2oth century, German GDP sprung even further that time with the reunification and the inauguration of the Euro.Japan also carried quite a bit of momentum from its growth spurt in the early 20th century and quickly became the leader of Asian economy.

13,"Germany and Japan benefited from the fact that they had to completely start over. For example, while Germany was occupied, France and the USSR gutted what was left of German industry in order to build up their own industries. When Germany finally re-industrialized, it had to get all new machinery, while France and the USSR were stuck with old German machinery. Since most companies are reluctant to spend money on new equipment when the current equipment still works (if it ain't broke, why fix it?), German companies gained a competitive advantage.

For example, while Germany was occupied, France and the USSR gutted what was left of German industry in order to build up their own industries.

Since most companies are reluctant to spend money on new equipment when the current equipment still works (if it ain't broke, why fix it?), German companies gained a competitive advantage. Japan was never as industrialized as the West in the first place, so it benefited from the same investment into new machinery as Germany.Germany and Japan didn't have to deal with entrenched industries. Countries tend to protect their major industries, so when they're no longer competitive, the government will subsidize them or put up trade barriers. This is not only costly, but it discourages innovation. Basically, money goes into maintaining the status quo instead of investing in new industries. With a limited industrial base, Germany and Japan could focus on investing in industries that had good future prospects. While Germany and Japan often protected their industries, it was to give their fledgling industrial sector a chance to grow. Both German and Japanese industrial policy was heavily export-oriented, so their industries had to be competitive.Related to the idea of entrenched industries is institutional sclerosis. Essentially, a country's institutions become less capable and responsive over time as increasingly powerful interest groups, which benefit from the current system, resist change. This is, arguably, what happened to the UK. The UK had not undergone any substantial institutional changes in decades, so its institutions were unable to properly respond to changing global conditions, such as the loss of the Empire, and domestic issues, such as highly confrontational business-labor relations.Since Germany and Japan were starting over, they could create institutions attune to current conditions and they weren't hindered by entrenched interest groups. This allowed them to grow rapidly while the UK went into decline. Of course, both have since gone through their own periods of institutional sclerosis.One last thing to note, GDP is a poor point of comparison as Germany and Japan have much larger populations than the UK. Japan's population is twice that of the UK. Even if the people themselves were equally wealthy, the country as a whole would appear poorer.

Probably not so much in Germany since the population was pretty well indoctrinated that the war had been about fighting Bolshevism in the first place.That the Marshall plan was probably one of the primary reasons for the rapid rebuilding, one only has to look at the relative difference between West Germany and East Germany at the time of reunification.  It was huge, and even today, there is still a big difference between the two regions of unified Germany.With respect to the U.K.  After WWII Britain was essentially bankrupt.  It had to continue rationing into the 1950's in both foodstuffs and housing.The US was almost carrying the UK in the final years of the war.After the war, the UK was faced with colonies demanding independence, and fulfilling promises made to places like India about post war independence in exchange for assistance in the war.So suddenly the UK was being shorn of its far flung empire when it needed it the most.  Did you know that it was against English law for Indians to make salt?  That is why Gandhi marched to the sea and his followers were beaten.  It was a British monopoly and all salt had to be imported and purchased from the UK.  So loss of the Indian colony alone meant a huge hit to the Exchequer's balance sheet.On a last note, Japan and Germany had their own military industrial complexes, and those companies such as VW, Mitsubishi, Porshe, Mercedes, BMW, Toyota, IG Farben, Krupp and the like, all profited massively from the war, and in all likelihood had sheltered a lot of cash in foreign countries.  So rebuilding was probably partially funded by profits earned during the war.Some recommended reading:  The Arms of Krupp, any book on IG Farben, there are several.  IG Farben was dissolved as a corporation, but likely it was along the lines of Standard Oil, where JD Rockefeller actually became even wealthier by the breakup of his monopolistic empire.In the rush to contain the spread of communism, little was done to hold accountable those companies and corporate leaders who might have done things during the war.  Instead, the goal was to put people back to work by putting those companies to work rebuilding the two shattered countries.In the UK it seems the rush was towards socialism which had the opposite effect.",486 followers,Harmen Breedeveld,6.1K,99,1.9M,2016,https://www.quora.com/Which-emerging-technologies-are-people-the-least-familiar-with-but-will-have-the-largest-impact

As Britain was almost entirely reliant on its colonies for raw resources and materials, it was unable to provide itself with the cheap labour and trade that it took from those countries it had previously colonised. Britain would extract the raw materials from its extended empire using cheap labour or slavery, and ship them back to Britain, where they would be processed and used in factories to build machinery, and create clothes and cutlery etc. It would then export the manufactured goods back across the empire (the cutlery back to India for example) for a high price, from which it would profit heavily.With the the empire dissolving, this was no longer a viable option, and Britain's influence across the world, both politically and in trading terms, reduced dramatically.

20,"To answer this question you first have to look at the status of Germany after WW2.Post-war Germany was quickly divided into two occupation zones. The Soviet-occupied East Germany and Allied-occupied West Germany. Allies at that time (post-war) means France, UK and the USA. Development in both zones differed substantially as West Germany went for democracy and capitalism whereas East Germany went for party dictatorship and socialism.It is a common misconception that Germany in both zones was completely destroyed after WW2. It is indeed true that most of the cities were bombed. Housing and foodTo answer this question you first have to look at the status of Germany after WW2.Post-war Germany was quickly divided into two occupation zones. The Soviet-occupied East Germany and Allied-occupied West Germany. Allies at that time (post-war) means France, UK and the USA. Development in both zones differed substantially as West Germany went for democracy and capitalism whereas East Germany went for party dictatorship and socialism.It is a common misconception that Germany in both zones was completely destroyed after WW2. It is indeed true that most of the cities were bombed. Housing and food supply was a serious problem especially in the cold winter of 1946/1947. People lived in the ruins of the houses and it was extremely cold, food supply was bad. I have attached a picture of my hometown so you get the idea how many German cities looked like.City center of Hannover as viewed from the town hall. The church on the right was never rebuilt but remains as a war memorialDevelopment in West GermanySince many males were POWs, dead or either too young or too old to work, rebuilding of the houses in the first post-war years was mainly done by women, or so-called ‘Trümmerfrauen’ (1). Payment was granted in food coupons. Cheapest labour you can think of. We owe them a lot. Food supply was organized by the Allied command.On the economical level the situation was not as bad. Despite the difficult initial situation after the surrender in May 1945, unlike in the case of housing, around 80-85% of the production capacities remained undamaged in Germany. The industrial capacity was even higher than before the war. Damage to the infrastructure was rather punctual and not over large areas. It didn’t take much time to rebuild railroad networks, streets and Autobahnen.However, the occupation policy of the Allieds after the war was by no means aimed at a rapid economic recovery of Germany. Many of you may remember the Morgenthau plan whiched aimed at a complete deindustrilization of Germany and transformation into agricultural substates (2). In fact from 1945 to 1947 Germany was robbed of its intellectual properties. Over a period of two years, the USA took all German patents and industrial secrets at a value of almost 10 billion US dollars. German scientists were forced to work in the USA. You may remember Wernher von Braun (a clear Nazi btw.), who was later head of the NASA space rocket program.The British also seized business plans by kidnapping German scientists and technicians and interning German businessmen if they refused to disclose their business secrets. The German post-war chancellor Konrad Adenauer wrote in his memoires that the damage to the German economy was very high and could hardly be quantified in dollars. As an example, the Volkswagen factory in Wolfsburg was about to be dismantled and shipped to the UK to produce the VW Beetle under a British brand name but no British manufacturer was interested in the factory and its product (happy for us Germans). The subsequent success of VW and the Beetle shows that this was not a good decision. Between the end of WW2 and the beginning of the European Recovery Program in 1948 (3), Germany was in fact robbed especially in East Germany, where factories were dismantled and shipped to the USSR on a very large scale (4). Dismantling also took place in the Western Zones although not in those quantities. It was projected to dismantle 1500 factories in order to reduce production levels to around 50 percent from the industrial niveau in 1938. Fortunately for us this plan was never fulfilled. So you could rather summarize that the Allies were initially not interested in rebuilding or spending money for Germany at all, but rather called for war reparations or simply took them.When it became clear that the cold war was about to begin, these policies changed and a rapid recovery of the Western Zone in Germany and of whole Europe was favoured by the USA. This policy change was the consequence of the Truman doctrine which wanted to limit the post-war Soviet expansion in Europe (containment). Europe was very weak and it was feared that European countries would fall one by one under Soviet influence.What happened next is still astonishing and it is still under debate how this worked out. Surprisingly the economic recovery in Germany was rather quick, especially in the Western Zone. In Germany one speaks of the post-war miracle or ‘Wirtschaftswunder’ (5). The reasons for the fast recovery are multitude and too complex to answer (at least for me). One element of the rapid recovery of the economy was certainly the Marshall plan or otherwise called European Recovery Program (3) and another major factor was the currency reform. Unlike the common belief the Marshall plan was not a gift to the receiving nations but a mixture of cheap credits and subsidies. Germany received 1.4 billions dollars over 4 years from which most of it was later paid back. France and the UK also received large sums.So who paid for the rebuilding of Germany?Most of the rebuilding was paid for by Germany and its booming economy after 1948. Another factor after the surrender was private aid. Many American families paid indirectly for the rebuilding by helping Germany with so-called “Care-Pakete”.After the war millions of people in Germany, but also in other nations, were without food, clothing and medication. 22 charity organisations in the USA founded the private aid organization CARE or ‘Cooperative for American Remittances to Europe’. This organisation shipped >100 million CARE-Pakete to Europe. That is a lot of indirect help (also in US Dollars). Many CARE-Pakete went to Germany and helped survival of our people in the early years after the war. It is impossible to express the gratitude that many Germans still feel today towards the American people because of this help.The Marshall plan did exactly what it aimed for, at least in Germany. It boosted the economic and financial recovery of Western Germany and this enabled us to rebuild the country. A part of the Marshall plan money was gifted, around ~280 million US dollars. So in part the USA paid for the recovery in Germany although I cannot really calculate how much this was in percent of the total recovery spending. The final rebuilding especially housing and other buildings took >10 years. Remains of the war could still be seen in the 80s/90s.(1)(2)(3)(4)(5)",0 followers,Brent Cooper,6.2K,7.9K,410M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-emerging-fields-in-the-area-of-mechanical-engineering
21,"Mmm, a good question. Let’s compare it with a brawl.Germany is a nasty guy. Really tough. Has a history. He is strong, powerful, intimidating. He loves fighting. He was banned from the pub after an earlier brawl, but now he’s back, spoiling for a fight.The pub is already quite rowdy. In one corner, Japan is kicking China. In another corner lies Ethiopia, bruised and battered, with Italy gloating over him.Germany looks around, schmoozes somewhat with USSR and then picks a fight with a regular: Poland. Poland is a good brawler, but not nearly as good as Germany; Poland goes down.With that, all hMmm, a good question. Let’s compare it with a brawl.Germany is a nasty guy. Really tough. Has a history.

Poland is a good brawler, but not nearly as good as Germany; Poland goes down.With that, all hell breaks loose. USSR kicks Poland in the back and then hits Finland. UK and France team up and shout at both Germany and USSR. Japan grabs a knife.Germany catches his breath after defeating Poland and then lunges for UK and France. A few hits and WHOAH!! France is down!! He was getting old, but no one expected this.UK is shocked. Alone, he is not as strong as Germany and so he runs up the stairs, so Germany cannot deliver the knockout blow.Germany, drunk on success, turns against USSR. There is still lots of old enmity, over girls, over money, over everything.WHAM! USSR staggers, dazed and bleeding. WHAM! Germany hits him again. And again. And again. Teeth fly around, ribs break. But USSR just doesn’t go down.Meanwhile UK has asked his old mate USA to help. USA hesitates … until Japan hits him. In the face. With a chair. Germany laughs when he sees this, and taunts USA.Big mistake. Because USA is big. Scary big. FREAKISHLY big. And now he goes wild, kicking Japan and hitting Germany at the same time.Germany and USSR are still fighting, bleeding, screaming. UK and USA jump on Germany from behind and the three hit him with everything they’ve got: CRACK! Germany loses two ribs. KTOW! And another rib! TWOCK!! His jaw! SMASH! His kidney!Germany staggers. Then USSR lands a final sickening blow in his face … and Germany goes down.USA turns around. A final bone-shattering blow, and Japan just drops.The brawl is over.So why did Germany lose? He was fighting USSR, USA and UK at the same time. It’s that simple.","2,210 followers",Valeriu Tomiță,1.4K,317,8.6M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-emerging-fields-in-the-area-of-mechanical-engineering

But still the pictures from those days are shocking.As a side note, I once talked to a very old woman from Berlin. She said, “When I was young I believed the Kaiser. He took us to war and my husband never came back. I was left a single mother. Then came Hitler and I believed him. He also took us to war and my son never came back. Then I was just an old mother without a child. The communists came and said that this time, everything would be better. I believed them. They took away the beautiful house my late husband built for me and gave it to someone else. So don’t be as stupid as I was, never trust any politician.”",0 followers,Pete Dunham,504,4.9K,2.8M,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-emerging-fields-in-the-area-of-mechanical-engineering
