0,"By specifically mentioning petrol and diesel, I assume you are talking about creating alternative fuels for transportation, rather than simply talking about petroleum by-products such as plastics.The answer, as others have stated, is that we can do that today, although it will cost you in terms of energy required (and thus cost). It has been proposed that for manned Mars missions that methane-based rocket fuel be robotically produced on Mars using CO2 and water present on the planet. This fuel could then be used for the return trip(s).Here is a recent development in this technology:By specifically mentioning petrol and diesel, I assume you are talking about creating alternative fuels for transportation, rather than simply talking about petroleum by-products such as plastics.The answer, as others have stated, is that we can do that today, although it will cost you in terms of energy required (and thus cost).

1,"A first process of synthetic fuel has been developed in France in 1920’s from coal (lignite) liquefaction but it was too expensive. Then 2 german chimistes, Fisher and Tropsch, developed a synthetic fuel in liquefying a synthetic gas made from coal. Then a third German, Bergius, developed at the beginning of WWII the direct liquefaction with hydrogen and coal and tars at a temperature of 450 °C, with a 200 atmosphères pressure, with a catalyst.You maybe have heard that recently Germany decided to iA first process of synthetic fuel has been developed in France in 1920’s from coal (lignite) liquefaction but it was too expensive.

Green H2 will be made from water electrolysis. It will be a way to store the excess energy coming from solar and wind energy. (Tesla plans to store it in batteries)Green H2 will be used for industry and heavy transportationBut when you combine green hydrogen with ambient CO2, you can create a synthetic fuel. This way you remove some CO2 from the air, create a clean fuel (less particles, no sulfur’s and tars,…) that would be far better for sea freight.This is not advanced technology, we just need the motivation to move to a cleaner use of energy by any government. And that’s what Germany just decided to do.","2,108 followers",Daniel Wallander,1K,10K,53.9M,2020,https://www.quora.com/When-petrol-and-diesel-were-extinct-can-we-create-it-in-the-future-with-our-advanced-technology
2,"All fossil fuels use oxidation reaction of carbon to generate energy. In reduction reaction of carbon dioxide to any flammable carbon form would require the same amount of energy.

So energy required to create petrol/diesel from carbon dioxide would be equal to the energy generated while combustion.Maximum efficiency of heat engine is primarily reduced by second law of thermodynamics, which states heat cannot be completely converted other form of energy. Further the efficiency would be limited by design. In effect heart engines operate between 30 to 50 % efficiency.Now comes the efficiency of fuel generation process. Lets consider this process to be 100 % efficient. This would be highly unlikely but for ease of calculation lets assume so. So generating fuel using energy from fuel is basically useless.

6,"There are already several processes for converting coal, lignite etc into petrol like products. Bio diesel is another process by which oil like the diesel, is obtained. But for the present, in view of the far cheaper petroleum derived fuels, there is no incentive to use them. But when petroleum reserves run out these will come into their own and continuous research in this field will most likely make them even better.","5,360 followers",Valerio Cietto,677,2.4K,9.1M,2020,https://www.quora.com/When-petrol-and-diesel-were-extinct-can-we-create-it-in-the-future-with-our-advanced-technology
7,"Even assuming that EVERY main car manufacturer started building E.V.s RIGHT NOW, that where 100% Suitable for every use currently on the road, it would take AT LEAST 20 years to replace the current fleet, if you FORCED everyone to buy electric.Now, that is of course not going to happen.Firstly, Battery tech is not good enough to replace every vehicle on the road, though it IS getting better.

However even those batteries that ARE available are just to expensive. Which makes the car MORE expensive. And people less likely to change.Secondly, There is just not enough batteries being manufactured, or for that matter materials being mined FOR those batteries right now. Obviously more manufacturing facilities are opening as demand increases, like wise more mines. But its a slow process, and takes time. This limits the amount of E.V.s that can be manufactured.Third. Even once we CAN start manufacturing more E.V.s, not everyone can afford a new car. There will be a significant delay before CHEAP second hand E.V.s come on the market in any significant number. And we really don't know how those vehicles will perform, or what problems they will have. Manufacturers like Tesla, CLAIM 1,000,000 miles, but we don't know how correct that is, and many of these cars will still have the same problems as normal I.C.E. cars. Switches and electronics wear out, paint scratches, Inside Styling become unpopular, or just plane worn. Replacement parts become unavailable.Another interesting dilemma, many of these cars rely heavily on computers. As the last twenty years has shown us, computer tech evolves VERY quickly. It’s quite likely that even ten year old computer tech in E.V.s, will just not be sufficiently updateable software wise anymore.Even WHEN we can start manufacturing enough cars of the correct variety of models and types to replace the current fleet at a reasonable cost, it’s going to take at least twenty years to phase out “most” I.C.E.My guess is, unless there is a SERIOUS push from green politics to FORCE People to change to E.V.s we will still be seeing I.C.E. vehicles on the roads for at least another 30 years. And probably even after that.Even then there are bound to be some diehards who just can’t let their I.C.E. vehicles go.

The owner was there but his son handled the business end and he would not be back for an hour so I waited. I was having a pleasant conversation about the usual things- how the weather was, how the crops were doing this year, etc and all. During the course of our discussion somehow it came out that I was a mechanic and he had a broken diesel air compressor, so we moved into the building and while I was looking at his compressor (which powered all his shop equipment) I asked him to explain to me the philosophy regarding the Amish and electricity.His answer was that electricity was not “bad” or “evil” in any sort of way, but that it was for the most part “unnecessary” for most important things in life and the one certainty is that once allowed in where do you draw the line as to what is necessary and what is not? He used electric lights as an example, it is easy to install them and then have light whenever and wherever you need it, but then you wind up subconsciously doing thing you should have done during daylight that you can now do later on and as a result your life can gradually change without you being completely aware of that happening and without being completely aware perhaps it is changing in a way that is not in your best interest and well being. So for many it is their choice to not allow electricity into their household even if many of them now have electrified places of business.Anyway, that is my interpretation of my discussion with one Amish business owner and in no way did I ever get the feeling that technology was something they “feared”, most simply believe there are more important things in life that modern technology has a tendency to usurp given the opportunity.I got his compressor fixed, his son showed up (on a tractor) and we talked business for a bit and before I left the Dad picked a bunch of sweet corn for me in exchange for fixing the compressor, which I thanked him for.","115,111 followers",Daveed Phoenix,3.1K,9.9K,160.5M,2018,https://www.quora.com/When-petrol-and-diesel-were-extinct-can-we-create-it-in-the-future-with-our-advanced-technology

And you learn about religious myths from other cultures and you think: hmm, that’s kind of like what I grew up believing. Then slowly the weird stories from your religion stop making sense.You cross out the talking snakes and the walking on water and the flying horses, etc.Okay, you think, now I have a good religion without all the hard-to-believe stuff.Then you dig deeper and you realize that even the “good” parts have problems: xenophobia, sexism, slavery, exhortations to kill people who offend your faith or to go to war against them.That makes you uncomfortable.You decide you need a break from religion to think things through.You meditate and cogitate and wonder and ponder and you decide that you just can’t adhere to organized religion. You’re going to believe in your god but you can’t in good conscience be part of a religion whose texts advocate actions you consider morally abhorrent.Then you hear people talk of God. Every time they give arguments for his existence, it sounds hollow.Slowly, you start to realize that you just don’t think there is a god. This frightens you at first because you’ve been raised to think that atheists are immoral. But when you try to believe you just can’t shake the feeling that you have no more evidence for the god you believe in than the ancient Egyptians and Greeks did about their many gods. You come to view gods as nothing more than the expression and translation of our hopes into mythological form and the ever-shrinking total sum of what we do not yet understand.That’s why many of us don’t believe. We’ve read the books and heard the sermons and attended the religious services and participated in the rituals and sung the songs.
