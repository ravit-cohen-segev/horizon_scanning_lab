1,"I learned this years ago from a Flight Attendant who literally sat in the back of a plane near me and chatted it up, and I thought we were flirting, only for her to tell me she had a boyfriend at the end of the flight.She was a tease or I was a guy misreading the signs. Probably the latter :):|When these masks drop down.They aren’t actually connected to oxygen tanks.Those masks have a tube of chemicals connected to them. They refer to them as “oxygen candles” that burn for about 15 minutes and provide you a source of oxygen.Also - these people in the picture are wearing the masks wrong.

2,"“You’ll know if you need it”. If there’s a AS/middleware component that you need specific to Oracle WebLogic or Websphere, the pre-sales engineer will make you well aware of it in advance. The other reason you may have behind chosing one or the other as a container is 1: pre-existing relationships with vendors willing to give you discounts, 2: hardware which runs a specific AS better than others (e.g. if you have a lot of IBM AIX machines running DB2, and your IT guys want to keep homogeneity, then Websphere’s going to be your best choice), 3: a specific product might use a specific niche feat“You’ll know if you need it”.

The first three (and arguably Tomcat, if you’re willing to muck around in the trenches) are basically interchangable if you know what you’re doing. The only reason I’d imagine paying for Oracle would be political. Say, if I were a CIO in treacherous waters and wanted to mitigate risk on a large undertaking (a project re-write, an ERP integration/implementation, take your pick). If the project fails and I go before the board, I can pull up all my fancy charts delineating everything I did to mitigate risk, including “going with the best”[1]. It breaks my heart to say, but IBM is a-shambles now in terms of support. Even if you pay through the nose for IGS support, the quality of talent is subpar at best. I’m not sure where Oracle stands, but I’ve used their “Oracle Unbreakable Linux” and all it really is, is Red Hat Enterprise Linux with ksplice (a technology developed by a few MIT grads to allow live kernel upgrades which Oracle gained the rights to after acquiring the company[2]). A few kernel tunes here and there maybe but nothing fundamentally different from what someone well versed in Linux kernel compilations could do. That is to say, you’re not getting anything like 100% fault-tolerance (IBM z13s, HP Non-Stop, etc.) In fact, since JBoss (the commercial version) is run by Red Hat, one could easily make the argument that you’d get better kernel tuning support with a JBoss AS/RHEL setup if you select Linux as a platform. (RH has been at Linux far longer than Oracle, and I’d trust them to come on-site and tune to my needs over Oracle any day. As a bonus, RH is based on Massachusetts so you won’t have to deal with time differences or language barriers.) This is all a very long winded way of saying — Your best bang for buck is almost certainly going to be JBoss AS.[1] Similar to the saying “no one ever got fired for buying [Microsoft || IBM || ..]”, if the vendor you selected has name recognition, you can delegate blame to the contractors. For the same political reason, contractors are often brought in even when you have internal staff — no middle/high level manager wants to assume risk.[2] And","5,360 followers",Valerio Cietto,677,2.4K,9.1M,2016,https://www.quora.com/Which-is-the-best-emerging-technology-in-middleware
3,"It seems rather silly.3D printing is for producing things for which a mold doesn't work, either because of the complexity of the part or because of the material.3D printing is also expensive and time consuming.  The machines are failure prone and large (relative to the item being printed).Concrete is easily poured into an inexpensive mold.  Simple, cheap, and easily accessible pieces of wood are all that is needed.  It has worked well since the time of the Romans.There are already companies that can make a house from concrete, using styrofoam molds, in a very short amount of time.

4,"It's interesting, there were some experiments with mold-poured concrete houses back in the 19th century. They turned out to be difficult to construct, and relatively ugly, so the fad died. They were, however, impressively durable (apparently many of them are still standing today).The problem, as others have pointed out, that the areas most in need of quality housing is building materials, not the difficulting in building the  houses. If you can get the materials there, you've already got a supply of cheap and idle labor to do the building.I think automatic housing construction would only be eIt's interesting, there were some experiments with mold-poured concrete houses back in the 19th century.

Unfortunately, those are also the places where simple, gray, concrete structures don't appeal to most people.There might be some application for this kind of thing in the future. But I doubt it's going to be a major trend anytime soon. I just don't think the advantages are that significant.","358,949 followers",Sean Kernan,9.1K,5.6K,726.9M,2014,https://www.quora.com/Which-is-the-best-emerging-technology-in-middleware
