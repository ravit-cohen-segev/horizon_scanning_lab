The Oak Ridge National Laboratory was tasked with developing a nuclear aircraft engine.Oak Ridge National Laboratory produced a molten salt reactor design.Two solid fuel experimental nuclear engines called HTRE 3 and HTRE 1 also were designed and built at the current site of the Idaho National Laboratory.Analysts anticipated that the military requirements for a nuclear bomber would require developing a lightweight nuclear reactor capable of producing approximately 100 Megawatts to 300 megawatts of power. Translated into horsepower, the nuclear aircraft was expected to produce about 400 thousand horse power (300 Megawatts).(300 megawatt = 402 306.6 horsepower)(more information on aircraft nuclear reactors)Fusion has many significant advantages when used in direct nuclear aircraft propulsion and may ultimately have advantages over any currently proposed nuclear fission based approach -1) Fusion has no critical mass requirement; all that a fusion reaction requires is the right conditions be met (temperature, plasma density, and confinement time) to support fusion. As a result, very tiny fusion power plants can potentially be built.2) Fusion fuels are widely available in space. Hydrogen (and deuterium) is the most abundant elements in the universe. Hydrogen is fully 10^10 times more abundant by atoms in the universe than any combination of fission fuels (U233, U235, Pu239).3) When fusion fails to work, it tends to just flame out, and serious accidents and melt downs do not tend to happen4) Neutrons and gammas produced by fission reactors are hard to shield for aircraft nuclear propulsion applications. Charged particles like protons produced from He3-He3 fusion are somewhat easier and more cost effective to shield and harvest for driving electrically driven propellers. A combination of magnetic fields and electrostatic fields can be used to provide a low mass solution for biological shielding needed to provide excellent operator safety for mobile He3-He3 Inertial Confinement fusion reactors.Helium3-Helium3 fusionHe3 + He3-> He4 + 2 protons + 12.86 MeV (energy)He3-He3 fusion produces only charged protons and energy (no difficult to shield neutrons at all).Charged Protons produced from He3-He3 fusion can be collected on light weight grids and screens and used to directly power electric motors that actually drive the wheels of a nuclear car. Neutronless He3-He3 fusion does not require an expensive precision turbine-generator to convert nuclear heat into electricity (for He3-He3 fusion, lower cost and lighter weight direct collection of charged particles on light weight grids suffices).Will there ever be nuclear powered aircraft?Perhaps so (and perhaps sooner than you think).Mankind is currently in possession of a practical fusion technology (fission-fusion) that produces more energy from fusion than it takes to initiate and maintain for a few nanoseconds the fusion reaction.It is widely perceived that commercial forms of nuclear fusion are currently ~50 years away (and always will be) - but the reality is that such widespread and excessive pessimism about fusion isMankind came into possession of a practical way of generating energy from fusion over 50 years ago with the Ivy-Mike nuclear test of 1952 that produced fusion energy from pure Deuterium via DD fusion while using nuclear fission to reliably bring Deuterium fusion plasma to fusion conditions.A minimum size fission burst (or alternatively a laser irradiating a D-T filled beryllium micro-sphere which implodes initiating D-T fusion) which in turn launches a radiative shock detonation wave down a pressurized liquid deuterium-filled tube.A suitable Nuclear Aircraft design -Boeing’s Blaine Rawdon, a Senior Aircraft designer, designed an outstanding large aircraft that would be well suited to aneutronic Inertial Confinement fusion propulsion. The Pelican is intended for ground effect intercontinental flight skimming about 20 feet above the ocean surface. The Pelican can safely carry more cargo via ground effect sea skimming than can be achieved using conventional aircraft.The Boeing Pelican designed by Boeing senior designer Blaine Rawdon is a very large aircraft designed to operate on ground effect while moving a lot of cargo quickly and cheaply between continents. In fixed-wing aircraft, ground effect is the increased lift (force) and decreased aerodynamic drag that an aircraft's wings generates when they close to a fixed surface like the surface of the ocean.The Pelican if built would be the largest airplane in the world. If you stood the Pelican on one wingtip, the other wingtip would almost reach the top of a 50-story building. The Pelican weighs 6 million pounds and has 76 steerable tires to distribute that weight and keep it from turning runways into rubble. The aircraft is planned to be powered by eight 80,000-horsepower turbine engines driving four counter-rotating propellers, each of which is as tall as a five-story building. I believe that the aircraft design would be compatible with nuclear propulsion - in my view aneutronic p-B11 fusion or He3-He3 Inertial Confinement Fusion power plants producing nuclear electricity via direct conversion of fusion charged particles (protons and alpha particles) collected on light stationary screens which in turn is used to drive lightweight 90% efficient electric motors connected to props.",169 followers,Caulley Johnson,584,258,419.5K,2018,https://www.quora.com/How-much-horsepower-does-an-aircraft-nuclear-reactor-make

In the process some of the mass is lost, becoming energy, through E = MC^2. The mass of these atoms might be:1 + 1 = 1.95See that lost 0.05? That is missing mass, which has become energy. The lost mass is known as theFusion is common for atoms less massive then iron, while fission is common in atoms larger then iron. This is shown by the “energy per nucleon” plot below.To the left of iron - the smaller atoms - fusion is more likely. To the right, fission is more likely.Theoretically, you could fuse any atomSince then, we have studied many fusion reactions, by shooting beams of atoms at other atoms. “Fusibility” is measure in units of Barns. Here is the fusibility of three fusion reactions.This chart tells you, how likely two atoms will fuse at different collision speeds.The easiest fusion reaction to do is Deuterium and Deuterium. This is basically hydrogen, with an extra neutron in the center. The reaction is shown below.Deuterium fusion is very common. You can buy it off the web.

Thus, you need to give the atoms huge energies to overcome that repulsion, in something called plasma (gas with atoms that have lost (some of their) their electrons.Because the pressure inside the donut (us nerds call it a torus) can never be as high as inside the sun, the temperature in turn must be much higher than in the core of the sun, because the atoms need to have the chance to meet up (thus, we have a small number of really fast ions, instead of many more at lower speeds)To contain all this exceedingly hot plasma, you need magnetic fields of unbelievable strength, because we have no material that can be in contact with those temperatures. The only way to do so is to use superThus, the chamber in which the magnetic coils sit must be cooled to only a few degrees above absolute zero (so, about -270 degrees celsius). At the same time, we have the exceedingly high temperatures in the plasma of 150 million degrees Celsius.

The insane temperature inside the reactor must also be somehow turned into electricity. Nobody knows how to do that; the simple reason for this is that nobody knows how to turn millions of degrees of heat into usable electric power.All in all, fusion has remained a promise for decades but will not be developed in time to help us get rid of carbon fuels. Even if we finally developed a robust design that would produce electrical power, it would be hugely expensive, much more so than current fission plants, including the so-called fast beeder reactors, which produce very small amounts of waste.

That currently practical fusion technology is called fission-fusion, where nuclear fission is used to reliably produce the conditions for fusion.Mankind came into possession of a practical way of generating energy from fusion over 50 years ago with the Ivy-Mike nuclear test that produced fusion energy from pure Deuterium via DD fusion. Practical fusion will always be 50+ years ago (not 50 years away). Today, there are designs for smaller pure fusion devices designed to make clean energy (not blast effects) from pure DD fusion of Deuterium separated from sea water. One such design is called mini-Mike which is designed to produce a small predictable controlled energy yield of 250 GJ.It is widely perceived that commercial forms of nuclear fusion are currently ~50 years away (and always will be) - but the reality is that such widespread and excessive pessimism about fusion isThe energy needed to ignite an inertially confined thermonuclear fusion reaction in liquid (or solid) deuterium-tritium (DT) is not that large; it is on the order of not more than 20 MJ or about the same amount of chemical energy stored in about 2.5 cups of automotive gasoline.The problem is that this energy for ICF fusion ignition must be compressed in space (focused down to an area less than a 2 mm) and in time (to less than 3 nanoseconds).Note: Deuterium separated from sea water is totally non-radioactive and fusion of this fuel produces only totally non-radioactive nuclear waste (helium and neutrons).Fusion has many significant advantages when used in direct nuclear vehicle propulsion and may ultimately have advantages over gas and diesel cars -1) Fusion has no critical mass requirement; all that a fusion reaction requires is the right conditions be met (temperature, plasma density, and confinement time) to support fusion. As a result, very tiny fusion power plants can potentially be built.2) Fusion fuels are widely available in space. Hydrogen (and deuterium) is the most abundant elements in the universe. Hydrogen is fully 10^10 times more abundant by atoms in the universe than any combination of fission fuels (U233, U235, Pu239).3) When fusion fails to work, it tends to just flame out, and serious accidents and melt downs do not tend to happen4) Neutrons and gammas produced by fission reactors are hard to shield for vehicle or nuclear propulsion applications. Charged particles like protons produced from He3-He3 fusion are somewhat easier and more cost effective to shield. A combination of magnetic fields and electrostatic fields can be used to provide a low mass solution for biological shielding needed to provide excellent operator safety for mobile He3-He3 Inertial Confinement fusion reactors. Aneutronic fusion reactions like p-B11 and D-He3 are other good possibilities for fusion car applications and deserve close attention from designers.Helium3-Helium3 fusionHe3 + He3-> He4 + 2 protons + 12.86 MeV (energy)He3-He3 fusion produces only charged protons and energy (no difficult to shield neutrons at all).Charged Protons produced from He3-He3 fusion can be collected on light weight grids and screens and used to directly power electric motors that actually drive the wheels of a nuclear car. Neutronless He3-He3 fusion does not require an expensive precision turbine-generator to convert nuclear heat into electricity (for He3-He3 fusion, lower cost and lighter weight direct collection of charged particles on grids suffices).He3 fusion fuel is rare on earth but can be obtained from processing lunar regolith or potentially by synthetically manufacturing He3 in specially tuned D-D fusion reactors here on earth.A properly tuned D-D inertial confinement fusion reactor may be able to produce He3 on earth (so we may not have to go to the moon for it).D-D fusion is a practical reaction for energy production from inertial confinementIt is proposed (but not yet experimentally demonstrated) that there are a range of conditions (temperature, plasma density, and confinement time) that ICF D-D fusion reactors can be operated at that suppress the following D-D fusion side chainHe-3 + D -> He-4 + p + 18.34 MeVThis D-D fusion sidechain occurs at higher temperaturesand normally consumes the He3 produced inside a D-D fusion reactor. By properly tuning the operating conditions of a D-D ICF fusion reactor, it should be possible to make the ICF fusion reactor produce both fusion energy and He3 fuel.Manufacturing (2.3 x 10^13 metric tons) of He3 worldwide from modified D-D fusion of sea water would open up many fusion application that are now not seriously considered, including fueling nuclear fusion based transportation.Note: The amount of Deuterium in seawater is very vast (4.6 x 10^13 metric tons). The amount of He3 that could be produced from a modified form of D-D fusion that suppresses the He3 sidechain is similarly vast (2.3 x 10^13 metric tons).D-D fusion normally produces He3D-D Fusion of Deuterium fuel produces energy through four reactions:D + D -> He-3 + n + 3.268 MeVD + D -> T + p + 4.03 MeV(side chains)D + T -> He-4 + n + 17.588 MeVHe-3 + D -> He-4 + p + 18.34 MeVThe net effect of these four fusion reactions taken together is:6 D -> 2 He-4 + 2p + 2n + 43.243 MeVWill there ever be fusion cars?Early Magnetic Confinement Fusion power plants are likely to be very large and very stationary. ICF fusion power plants will probably be smaller than MCF fusion and may ultimately be of a size that could be installed in certain transportation vehicles (ships, trains, planes, trucks, and ultimately cars). What will probably be the most practical way to fusion powered vehicles (of a sort) for perhaps the next fifty years is to use stationary fusion power plants to produce electricity and then to use nuclear fusion produced electricity to charge conventional electric vehicles with storage batteries.Comparison of major fusion fuel cycles (including He3-He3)Chart of fusion fuels for mobile reactors and nuclear propulsion ----------","29,977 followers",Tomaž Vargazon,6.8K,7.7K,250M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Why-is-a-polywell-fusion-reactor-not-able-to-reach-net-energy-generation

16,"Nuclear power is inherently unsafe, but.Nuclear power plantThe main reason as to why nuclear power is unsafe is because you have approximately 12 months of fuel in the reactor cell at any one time. Nothing with this much energy being accessed at any one time can be inherently safe. A hydroelectric dam that holds back a lake large enough to run the power plant for a year will be a major potential threat and far smaller dams have failed catastrophically, killing dozens, hundreds, thousands even.Nothing that holds that much usable energy together, in one container, can ever be understood as inherNuclear power is inherently unsafe, but.Nuclear power plantThe main reason as to why nuclear power is unsafe is because you have approximately 12 months of fuel in the reactor cell at any one time.

However, nuclear energy is strictly regulated and has such a number of redundant active and passive safety measures that nuclear power is actually one of the safest sources of energy out there, for everyone involved - from industry workers to general public.This is akin to aviation. Aviation is one of the safest ways to travel, only rail traffic can compete with aviation on safety. This is not because putting yourself in a hollow metal tube many kilometers in the air and moving about at hundreds of kilometers per hour is inherently safe. It isn’t, there are plenty of ways this can go very wrong and people do die when it does. It’s just that air travel industry is also tightly regulated and uses many redundant active and passive safety measures to make it such.Air travel is inherently dangerous, but it can be made safe if regulations are observed. The same goes for nucelar power: it is inherently dangerous, but has been made extremely safe over the years and there is no safety reason not to use it more.",2 followers,Richard Muller,681,2.3K,202.4M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-difference-between-nuclear-fusion-and-nuclear-fission
