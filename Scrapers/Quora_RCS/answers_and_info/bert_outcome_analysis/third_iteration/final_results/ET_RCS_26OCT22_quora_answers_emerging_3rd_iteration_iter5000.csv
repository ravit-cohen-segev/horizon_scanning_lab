But articles predicting their complete demise have recently been countered. We still use computing-at-workstations. The notion of a workstation that is larger than a handheld will probably be with us indefinitely.

Perhaps it will become virtualized to where it is simply a gadget that you interact with at your desk, but has unrecognizable input/output devices. What would it take to drastically diminish their importance, would be a different work style for employees? If people don’t interact with computers as directly (perhaps the computer could always be listening and just do what is needed?) then the nearby PC might become a thing of the past.However, if considered in terms of its implementation, there are always new architectures being considered. The Von Neuman CPU+Memory, etc., architecture could be replaced.

1,"Better computers.To explain: Right now our mobile phones become more and more powerful. Not long and you won’t need a PC but a docking station for your phone.At some point the very slow interface “human -> computer” will be improved, at which point we will be partly computers ourselves.Computers will still exist though. So to answer, no, computers won’t be replaced. They will change form, become smaller, probably more connected to us, but still be computers. They are here to stay and won’t go anywhere.","135,539 followers",Hector Quintanilla,1.8K,1.2K,88.6M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Do-you-think-new-technologies-will-come-out-in-the-next-decade-to-replace-computers-PCs

6,"If anything, it may be replaced by automation. However, that will be one of the hardest ones to build. Reason is, unlike a passenger type vehicle, a street sweeper does more than simply move down the road. You have to go slower at times when there is a lot of debris or dirt on the road. Plus, the main reason it will not be automated is because on those with water and filters, many times the filters become clogged, and must be removed and cleaned before you can continue on. Also, some times trash will get caught in the machines and must be removed before you can continue.When cleaning parking lIf anything, it may be replaced by automation.

7,"I'll skip over the stereotypical shit of being flashed and witnessing various sexual acts which did indeed occur. This had a far deeper meaning and one I still hold close to my heart.It was a picture perfect day as I drove the two lane backroads through old-growth pine forests on my way to Crossett, Arkansas. Crossett is one of those, you can't get there from here, kind of places. The only thing in Crossett was the paper mill I was picking up at, and the only people who lived in Crossett, worked there.

There was only one way in, and one way out, and that was on that beautiful two lane backroad.Tunes up, windows down, I saw a large animal bound across the road a few hundred feet ahead of me. What the…?It wasn't a deer. It had a long tail. A large dog? Nuh-uh. I never saw a dog run like that. This thing flowed across the road.I slowed down to a stop where I thought I saw it had entered the woods. It had stopped to get a gander at me too. What I saw was remarkable and unmistakable. It was a large cat, as in cougar large. Once the cat was satisfied with what it saw, it went about its way.When I got to the mill in Crossett, I asked the guy loading my truck if they had any large cats running around in the woods around there. His reaction was immediate. He stopped his forklift and immediately called to his coworkers,”Hey, this feller saw the cat!”. It was like I was an instant celebrity. Everybody wanted to know all the particulars, the who, what, and where's of what I had seen. Apparently, that cat was something of legend. Years later I came to understand why.What I had seen was an Eastern Cougar.The Eastern Cougar was declared extinct in 2016.

8,It will be a big ask to replace a human on a task such as this. Much of the operation is dictated by the vagaries of others. Parked cars rubbish bins tight access and at times breaking the law. It may be doable if there is strictly and heavy law enforcement.

It not only records when I drift out of my lane, but also by how much. If I go 5 miles over on the speed limit, it records where, how much, and how long I was over. If I brake suddenly, it records that, too.I'm going to hang in there. I still love it too much.
