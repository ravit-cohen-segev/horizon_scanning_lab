As humans evolved technologically, so did society in terms of ethics, so why would aliens be different?It depends what kind of cultural moral philosophy they evolved to overcome the convergence of population growth-resource depletion-pollution-economic stagnation and what kind of cultural moral philosophy they have now as a result.In order to reach for the stars the first order of business is for the civilization itself to survive and not sink into decay and oblivion so some difficult choices have to be made.It must divest itself of identifiable passengers who will never contribute in any meaningful way so there would be an intense study of genetics with the aid of their Ai looking for the ideal model to carry the civilization into the future and all others would be eliminated one way or the other.So that is the key as to what kind of cultural moral compass a given interstellar culture has retained, I suspect they would be rather clinical in their approach to human frivolousness and therefore disapprove but would probably do nothing and just let nature take its course.I expect there are many failed civilizations in the galaxy and only a tiny few that make it.","7,511 followers",Chris Bast,9.1K,12.8K,41.2M,2021,https://www.quora.com/If-a-highly-advanced-alien-species-existed-would-it-be-safe-to-assume-that-would-be-peaceful-As-humans-evolved-technologically-so-did-society-in-terms-of-ethics-so-why-would-aliens-be-different
1,"I'm not so sure we've evolved much. Technology is only a few hundred years old and it's a tool for us to make life more comfortable. Spiritually we really lag! Look around the world. Nothing but conflict fueled by racial and ethnic fear and huge disparity between the rich and poor countries. Climate change, lack of resources, opportunities create despair which results in anger, war, and so point being we are nowhere close to an evolved alien species.My guess is they're observing and monitoring this planet. We are not ready for any type of communication with aliens and if they weren't peacefulI'm not so sure we've evolved much.

3,"Absolutely. Earth proves the concept.Humanity is not the only sapient speciesAbsolutely. Earth proves the concept.Humanity is not the only sapient speciesThe key thing seems to be locale. While the exact causes are up for debate, it seems very likely that one of the reasons Neanderthals aren't around today is because of when they came into contact with humanity. Once that happened it seems that the two either competed with one another until humanity came out on top, or got along so well that the two gene lines just merged back into one. Had natural barriers or environmental factors restricted their interaction until the populations and tech base of both were more established, it's entirely possible that today the French would be a legitimately different species from the rest of us rather than just occasionally acting as if they were.","220,628 followers",Franklin Veaux,1.7K,47.3K,783M,2020,https://www.quora.com/If-a-highly-advanced-alien-species-existed-would-it-be-safe-to-assume-that-would-be-peaceful-As-humans-evolved-technologically-so-did-society-in-terms-of-ethics-so-why-would-aliens-be-different

5,"If you spend time on YouTube and surf animal videos it is already clear that at least a handful of animals are sentient.Intelligences vary as does, perhaps, the degree of sentience but there is no doubt the line between animal and human is not completely distinct.It can vary by species but also by individual animal.I’ve seen dogs do incredible things with their mouths to compensate for a lack of hands.If dogs (or any animals) were suddenly given hands and arms it would be interesting to investigate if it would produce a jump in intelligence.One woman signs to her alligator and he responds.

Another video shows a zoo gorilla signing that zoo guests are not supposed to throw food to him.There is also some at least circumstantial evidence that living with and bonding with humans evokes more intelligent behaviors in many animals.If life evolves elsewhere as it has here I think it is quite possible for evolution to create more than one sentient species.

If the animals could talk they would say “Oh god, it just never stops!”.

The evaporating water might cool your fur down, but it won’t cool your skin down, and thus won’t cool down the muscles underneath that skin, which are the things that really need to lose the heat.So, we lost our body hair in order to become more effective hunters: to become the animal-world equivalent of this guy.",201 followers,Max Williams,3.5K,1.4K,3M,2020,https://www.quora.com/If-a-highly-advanced-alien-species-existed-would-it-be-safe-to-assume-that-would-be-peaceful-As-humans-evolved-technologically-so-did-society-in-terms-of-ethics-so-why-would-aliens-be-different
