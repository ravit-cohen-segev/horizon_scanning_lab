This meant building a navy that could challenge Western navies. To that end, the Japanese initially had the better carriers, better carrier based planes, and bigger/badder warships. Much of their tactics had been developed and sharpened through their previous military experience fighting in China, giving them a head start on ironing out and fixing some deficiencies.Of particular note, there was a HUGE disparity in naval torpedoes. The Japanese “long-lance” was one of the most effective torpedoes ever developed, while the US Navy’s Mk.14 was one of the absolute worst, to a scandalous degree.Japan also built some of the world’s largest submarines, the I-400 class, which were unsurpassed in size until long into the cold-war when larger ICBM carrying submarines eventually surpassed it. The plan was to use these to conduct strikes on places like the Panama Canal.That said, Japan also did not necessarily have the resources to go all-out high-tech either. The whole point of Japan invading the rest of Asia was to collect those resources. This also had an impact on their military doctrine. Japanese soldiers were generally equipped with less gear and supplies than the average American soldier, and were expected to make this up by scavenging it from the land they occupied. They were running as cheaply and simply as possible, they did not have the industrial capacity nor the logistical ability to keep high-tech machines in good working order.This meant that both the need for advanced designs and the capability to produce them were not initially obvious, and by the time Japan realized this, it was often too late to produce or use these developments.As an example, Japan only realized that it might need a long-range 4 engine strategic bomber after it captured a few American B17s. The result was the G8N, a plane that only flew a few times and was captured at the end of WWII with no hope of making a difference. By the time Japan had captured those B17s (indeed, even sometime before Pearl Harbor), the US had already been developing the B29",150 followers,David Jones,3.2K,270,841.1K,2022,https://www.quora.com/Why-are-humans-so-violent-and-warlike-Why-with-so-much-knowledge-and-advanced-technology-is-so-much-of-it-devoted-to-war

It’s easy to look back now and see the war crimes committed by the Axis powers, but that kind of information wasn’t common knowledge in those days. The little pieces of information that were able to get through to higher-up commands were dismissed as unreliable, even exaggerated. Germany framed the invasion of Poland as if the Polish Army attacked them first. The public had no moral reason to want an expensive and deadly war.There were some economic incentives. While economies on both the Allied and Axis sides couldn’t cope with war production needs and the loss of male workers, America could supply the world with their factories. As the last decade had been spent in the Great Depression, the idea of more jobs without joining the fight was enticing. The UK, as an island, depended heavily on American shipments of food across the Atlantic. Germany, on the other hand, depended heavily on American manufacturing because it was diverting resources elsewhere. Japan only bombed Pearl Harbor to take out the Pacific Fleet, leaving the Pacific islands open to take.As well as indifference and a desire to just stay out of it, some Americans were also very much opposed to entering the war. Isolationists believed that America shouldn’t get involved in any foreign war.When the Japanese Army bombed Pearl Harbor, it provided a strong enough motive to turn public opinion from indifference and downright hostility towards the war to patriotic endorsement. The US also needed some way to guarantee that the 30 billion dollars worth of war materials lent to the Allies would be repaid. This obviously couldn’t happen if they lost the war.To summarize, the US needed a reason to enter the war. Just as the Zimmerman Telegram provoked entrance into World War II, the bombing of Pearl Harbor paved the way to the US joining the Allies.",111 followers,George Johnson,834,0,0,2018,https://www.quora.com/When-did-America-start-using-their-advanced-technology-during-World-War-II

World War II, unlike the first world war, was a war of annihilation and clashing political ideologies, some genocidal, and not just on the Axis side. In Europe Hitler was fighting a both a race war and a rematch of the Great War pitting an authoritarian state against”the decadent democracies.” Though the Versailles Peace Treaty and the “Guild and Reparations” clause triggered the Second European War Hitler had much broader goals in mind than mere revenge. “Until the first war I was sentimental about losses in combat. Then, when I saw thousands of my comrades fall to the left and right of me I realized the individual is nothing and preservation of the species everything.” Hitler always held true to the belief that no sacrifice is too great in war if that war is fought for the sake of race. The millions who fell on the Eastern front died to save Europe, dominated by Germany, from “Bolshevism and the Jewish poison from which it springs.” Hitler truly believed history, and the German people, would not forgive him if he DID NOT send so many German soldiers to their graves in this “Crusade in the East.” After Stalingrad he took to the radio and spoke, “What is life? Life is the German people, not the individual soldier.” To this end Hitler mobilized a mass technology of death. “First the tank, then the airplane and finally the battleship.” Part of Hitler’s military genius his realization that whereas the nineteenth century had been dominated by naval power, and thus by Britain, the combination of the tank and airplane had made land warfare once again decisive, and now it was Germany’s turn to master the world. If he could muster enough tanks and planes to mount a giant land invasion of Russia, then Germany would conquer the “world heartland”; its hegemony unchallenged for a thousand years. Yet, this territorial conquest was but a prelude to the holocaust. Mass industrial technology at the service of genocidal ideology to redraw the racial map of Europe and put an end the Jews, Slavs and the Roma, among other “enemies of the Reich.”I do not believe the rape of Nanjing and other atrocities were equal to the holocaust, either morally or practically. Japan had different designs and goals for the war than Nazi Germany. Her actions in China and Korea proved imperial Japan could be just as brutal as the Nazis when it came to civilians. The big difference is that Japan did not aim for a war of annihilation of whole peoples, as Hitler did for the Jews and Roma, among others. Since Japan wanted to build a “Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere” (GEACS) she had to give some degree of autonomy to subject peoples. We know the Japanese had the capacity for biological warfare in China, yet it was not used to kill millions of Chinese. Why not? Japan envisioned China as a future junior partner in the GEACS, not a desolate wasteland as Hitler planned for the Soviet Union. Japan developed her own brand of racial superiority, “Occidentalism” as the scholar Ian Buruma calls it, before World War II, but this was totally different from the eradicationist anti-semitism that was already in vogue in Germany before Hitler took power.","1,708 followers",Niklas Kager Kofler,688,305,8.3M,2017,https://www.quora.com/When-did-America-start-using-their-advanced-technology-during-World-War-II

If the ecology moves significantly in one direction or another, for example getting too hot, then the equilibrium shifts and now the species is judged against a different environment in terms of survival.I can't think of an animal that would be able to extend its range at this point to beyond it's ecological equilibrium without fire.And tool use is very limited among animals.It's unlikely that any animal will fill our ecological niche anytime soon.",121 followers,Jeffrey Chan,9.9K,1.5K,4.5M,2021,https://www.quora.com/When-did-America-start-using-their-advanced-technology-during-World-War-II

22,"My money would be on raccoons, because they have very good hands already. Tool use, and the benefits of making better and better tools, seem to have driven the evolution of human intelligence. There are plenty of species which already have primate-level intellects - elephants, corvids, parrots, orcas, bears, the brightest dogs, even octopodes and cuttlefish - but out of the possible candidates raccoons have the best potential to become high-level tool-makers, because they have the best manual dexterity.
