The pathetic state of Indian manufacturing can be gauged from the fact that 69 years after independence, India can't even manufacture products as simple as earphones. Yes, even your earphones are probably manufactured in China, though they might contain a Made in India tag, to fool the Indians.Comparing the two countries would be a great injustice to China. Most of Chinese people don't want their country to be compared with India, they think of it below their dignity, the same way we think of Pakistan.

Old School Innovators—Fortune list of 100 Most Innovative Companies has Amazon and Facebook, but also Unilever, Starbucks, Visa and other such companies. India has 5 companies in the list—Hindustan Unilever, Bharti Airtel, Sun Pharma, L&T and Maruti Suzuki. Three of these have strong foreign heritage.5. Fast Company’ 2018 Top 50 Innovative Companies had none from India, and even if you look at the top companies in sectors like Food, Transportation, Energy, Data Sciences, all priority areas for India, almost no companies show up.6. Lets move to education.QS Top Universities does not report any Indian institute amongst Top 10 global engineering universities. China has Nanyang and Tsinghua, and National University of Singapore is in there—so 3 from Asia in Top 10.No Indian university was in Top 50 byFinally, Careers360, an Indian publication, had IIT-Delhi at No 44 as the top-ranked engineering school.In Sciences, which are the foundation for Engineering, we are even more dismal!!Now I disagree with many of these rankings and their methodologies, but sure when India doesnt show up anywhere or on any list, the general thesis must be true—that India is largely irrelevant to the global technology scenario.Actually that’s unfair to say. Our greatest contribution to global technology is to export very driven and reasonably well-educated people to places where they can use their talents to develop practical technology and build companies that affect the world. And that global companies (and investors) set up research labs in India because we have bright people but poor managers and ecosystem to nurture innovation and convert it into real products and businesses.Yes, we are great supporters, as companies and universities from America, China, Britain, Korea, Germany, Japan and other countries rely on our manpower but unfortunately, most of the technology developed by these people belongs to and commercialized by those nations, not India.We like to fool ourselves and have an inflated sense of pride—why? Simply because we have 1.4 billion people and a stable political / economic / social environment.Our governments are not focused on strengthening education, improving healthcare, and providing measures that truly spur innovation and creativity.Instead of investing in deep tech startups, our entire startup ecosystem is funded and owned by American and Chinese investors, and mostly chase useless consumer technology ideas like one more logistics and food delivery app business. Where is the real innovation and technology?So, sir, to summarize—Added on 28-Oct:Had some discussions recently with VCs and entrepreneurs on a trip to NY/SF. New insight. They said that in the US, big companies and the Government pay top dollar or even unreasonable amounts to buy new technologies, thus creating a customer base for startups and innovators. In India, on the other hand, both Govt and large companies tend to be very conservative and stingy customers. Therefore innovators don't find a good market and have to compete in foreign markets which is naturally harder. This slows down the customer trials and feedback process, which in turn slows down innovation and product development, not to mention reduces investment in innovation as the route to market is harder.This adds one more reason why India lags behind technologically. While US, China, Israel etc have active ecosystems, India doesn't, and isn't building one either, putting its tech sector at a further disadvantage.","68,774 followers",Kanthaswamy Balasubramaniam,1.4K,17.3K,413.3M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Is-India-going-to-supersede-the-USA-or-China-in-the-next-50-years-in-science-and-technology

Here’s a comparison of India-China firepower.As you can see China is superior to India in every possible way from Aircrafts, Armoured vehicles, Submarines and even the Defence Budget. (Note: Chinese Tanks are 3050 and not 13050)Now the assumption is China is attacking and India is defending. India is not interested in expanding its territories, unlike China. (e.g. Tibet, South China sea, Taiwan, etc.)There’s seems no way India can hold its own against a Chinese assault.It looks hopeless. Doesn’t it?Now let me talk about the Biggest weakness of China.It’sLet us divide the war centers into Land, Sea and Air theatres. First let’s discuss a conflict between People’s Liberation Army vs Indian Army assets. The manpower is the same so we will keep that aside for the moment.Land Warfare - PLA vs IA:The first thing that India can do to defend its territory is to destroy crucial bridges, turn all-weather roads into rubble and block strategic mountain passes. Once that is done, the advancing army will be stopped cold.That is Strike One.Air Warfare - PLAAF vs IAF:But what about logistics. Take a look at this.Source:PLAAF has only 5 large airbases in Tibet and 2 in Xinjiang. India on the other hand has nearly 20 bases within flight range of the LAC.So where are the majority of the 3000 aircraft of the PLAAF?They are on the eastern side.3500km away from the action.This would mean mid-air refueling.It would mean a longer time to respond after a primary attack.And India will be able to track the incoming aircraft long before it reaches the war theater.The seven Chinese airbases near the Indian border are not adequate for an Indian attack/retaliation.Group Capt (Retd) Ravinder S Chhatwal says: “To launch any air campaign, fighter aircraft have to be deployed close to the border, roughly about 200 km to 300 km from the border of your enemy. Against India, China will have to deploy its fighter aircraft in Tibet and adjacent airfields in Xinjiang. China has 2,100 combat aircraft but most of them are deployed on its eastern seaboard. They cannot deploy all of them against India because of limited number of airfields in Tibet.”“Now, the second point is that to carry out sustained fighter aircraft operations, airfields have to be mutually supporting. By mutually supporting, I mean, that if you take off from an airfield there should be another airfield nearby within 100 or 200 km, so that in case of requirement for diversion etc., you have an alternative airfield. In the northern Xinjiang sector’s two airfields Hotan and Kashgar - the distance between them is 450 km while the distance between Hotan and Gargunsa is 550 kms. Hotan to Korla, the distance is 750 km so they are not mutually supportive. In western Tibet, there is only one airfield, Gargunsa. If Gargunsa is bombed by the Indian Air Force, there will be a gap of 1,500 km between Hotan and nearest airfield Hoping.”Group Capt Chhatwal (Retd) concludes by making a pertinent point: “There is another limitation which they have. In the airfield, when you park aircraft for fighter operations, they have to be in blast protected shelters - concrete shelters. China doesn’t have any blast protected shelters at any of the airfields. After Doklam they have realised their mistake and have now started building these in Kongka Dzong (Lhasa) airfield.”Reference:There is another Logistic problem. That of cargo weight.Indian airbases with the exception of a few are the on the plains.Tibet airbases are at an altitude of 4000m above sea level.The lower air density at such high altitudes hampers jet engines and limits the amount of Weapons and fuel military aircraft can carry while still being able to take off.Meteorological conditions across the Tibetan Plateau, moreover, are unpredictable, making it difficult to plan high-intensity air campaigns.In short, the PLAAF cannot hope to run a Sustained air campaign.That is Strike TwoNow let’s talk about the Navy.Sea Warfare - PLAN vs INThis one is really interesting because PLAN has 76 submarines compared to a paltry 16 subs on our end. In total, China has 714 naval assets while India has only 295.But China again has a Geography problem.And that’s the choke point in the Straits of Malacca.Source:If the Chinese Navy enter the IOR (Indian Ocean region) to engage with the Indian Navy, they will have to come through this Strait. And this channel is very narrow; only 2km at its narrowest point.It will be difficult for them to send naval assets in the IOR without significant resistance from the Indian Navy guarding the entrance via Indira Point.The second, even more important point is that ofOil is the fuel on which the war machine runs.And 80% of China’s oil is imported through the Malacca strait.A naval blockade on Malacca, Lombok and Sunda straits will bring upon an oil crisis.China has stored oil reserves in certain places for emergencies.But it won’t last long if they use it on a war-footing. Or if its targeted by India.Without oil, their entire military juggernaut will come to a screeching halt.And that’s why I mentioned that China can be checkmated in a week.Strike Three.But not yet out.Why?BecauseThe easiest way China can overcome their Geography problem is by launching Dongfeng Missiles.But it will be an unwise move.When a Missile is in the air, their is no way for the other country to know if the warhead is conventional or nuclear.India will assume nuclear and launch its own Agni missiles.And then it will be pouring Dongfengs and Agnis on India and China.Cloudy with a chance of nukes…The decision for both countries will be: Counterforce or Countervalue?Counterforce means attacking enemy’s military installations.Countervalue means attacking cities and innocent civilian population centers.Nuclear think-tanks believe that in the fog of war, misinformation and disinformation will be at its peak.A country starting with Counterforce attack, would assume the other can make (or has made) a Countervalue attack.Once a single missile is launched between nuclear rivals, it can quickly escalate to Countervalue attacks targeting dozens of big cities including Mumbai and Shanghai.The death toll will be in millions.More than the casualties in the Second World War.Both nations will be pushed back by a quarter of a century.And that will end the much touted Asian Century.To come back to the question: Can India defeat China in a full-fledged war?All answers can be found in History.The most powerful superpower USA failed to defeat an undeveloped Vietnam even after trying for 20 years.China & India are third and fourth strongest military in the world. There’s NO way either can defeat the other.At best, they can claim few square kilometers of each other’s territories.Eventually they will have to come to the negotiating table.So it will be all for naught.In fact, it will cost a saddening amount of lives with no tangible gains.P.S: I have answered as per the question.I have nothing against the common Chinese people. Loss of a single life is devastating for the family who encounters it. Be it Chinese or Indian lives. But when we hear it on the news, its just a number. We can’t feel the trauma.An eye for an eye will make the whole world go blind.But.No retaliation will mean that the blind people will be ruled by one-eyed men.Peace can only happen when the adversary knows you are too strong to be defeated and is afraid of your retaliation.CCP can push all they want, but they will meet strong resistance and retaliation from the Indian Army, Airforce and Navy.And then they will learn their lesson.Jai Hind!",201 followers,Pundrik Shah,5.8K,71,486K,2020,https://www.quora.com/Is-India-going-to-supersede-the-USA-or-China-in-the-next-50-years-in-science-and-technology

Additionally, India has levels of sanitation and infrastructure that veritably scream “third world.” Their levels of cast (racial/skin color) prejudice make America’s “Jim Crow Era” look positively progressive by comparison. Indeed, racial discrimination is “baked in” to the operations of even their most advanced corporations and universities . While the higher casts enjoy respect and opportunity for both sexes, the lower (blacker) casts are treated as filth and the women as worthless. Sadly, because of the terribly unfair way wealth is distributed among the lower casts, the stereotypes of them being presumed to be habitually, dirty, uneducated, and impoverish is all too often correct.Abject poverty on the Indian subcontinent is the lasting impression taken away by most visitors and potential investors to India from other parts of the world. Anyone of means staying for an extended period must quickly become accustomed to, say, a poor, obviously malnourished woman who sweeps his foyer floor three times a day using a crude bundle of sticks. If he is curious enough to pursue knowledge of this woman’s life, he may well discover that she and her entire family live in a small section of the ally between his home, and the one next door, and that this financial arrangement is a jealously guarded part of the family’s life.India has chosen to accept and adapt to its systemic poverty rather than attack it head-on. It also suffers from some of the most widespread and deeply rooted political corruption on earth. This makes it exceptionally difficult to attract investment from outside of India. They are also the nation most likely to face the consequences of a nuclear attack courtesy of its equally impoverished neighbor, Pakistan. With all of the problems I have outlined, it seems VERY UNLIKLY that India will ever surpass the U.S. or China at science, technology, or anything else except giving birth to dangerous new diseases of a closely packed, poorly nourished people whose life goal is to bathe in the excrement of their fellows in the Ganges River.",0 followers,Andrew Carver,533,0,0,2017,https://www.quora.com/Is-India-going-to-supersede-the-USA-or-China-in-the-next-50-years-in-science-and-technology
