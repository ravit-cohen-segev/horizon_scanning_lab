0,"DICE has developed an engine were you can destroy a certain amount of things in an open world. It is called frostbite 3. It uses destruction 4.0 to make it look as realistic as possible. But to make everything destructable, you need the highest-end CPU, highest-end GPU and RAM. It is such extremely complex to let all the particles fall in the good direction, with a set amount of speed and impact. And to calculate all that, you need a lot of RAM and processing power, especially if you are destroying multiple objects at a time.Frostbite 3 logoDICE has developed an engine were you can destroy a certain amount of things in an open world.

1,"I believe that as tech improved, the technical aspects of games went through the roof in terms of getting better, but at some point in the previous generation of consoles (Xbox 360, PS3 and Wii), design and artistic decisions started to lose ground against visuals and tech aspects at a AAA game level.Some examples:I believe that as tech improved, the technical aspects of games went through the roof in terms of getting better, but at some point in the previous generation of consoles (Xbox 360, PS3 and Wii), design and artistic decisions started to lose ground against visuals and tech aspects at a AAA game level.Some examples:It seems like the more technically advanced games become, the less resources there are left for those details that were standard in games. Luckily for us, this gen has been sort of a comeback for features such as the examples I gave in this answer, but there is still some ground to cover in order to be where we were before the balance tipped in favor of tech and speed of development.",43 followers,Prasad Muley,1.2K,0,0,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-impacts-of-current-and-emerging-technology-has-on-the-design-and-development-of-computer-games-to-meet-the-users-requirements-and-the-computer-games-industries

3,"Thanks for the A2A! :)And the answer is…I know, I know. I’m a computer science major. I’m supposed to fall in love with all technology that comes in my way. Well, I hate to break it to everyone, but I do not. I do love technology, but there are some problems that I do face because of it, such as frustration with my poor laptop <3.While these are not my reasons, most of the common reasons I heard are reduced face-to-face communication, staying indoors for long periods of time, and eroding relationships.All in all, don’t worry, it is not weird at all!

Many people I know do not like technology in the 21st century for a variety of reasons. Although, hopefully, there are some that you do like :).

4,"With airplanes, rockets, nuclear power and computers, we’re spoiled for choice. What a century! I would still pick the medical advances: new vaccines, antibiotics, improved surgeries, knowledge of nutrition, and the beginnings of DNA analysis.Why? Because I read a lot of 19th century biography. I’m one of six children, in my mid-sixties; all my brothers and sisters are alive, and (knock on wood) will probably be alive 20 years from now. Almost every biography I read has either an orphaned hero, or sisters, brothers, wives or children who died. 150 years ago, in the wealthiest classes and the mWith airplanes, rockets, nuclear power and computers, we’re spoiled for choice.

5,"I have a working proof of concept prototype of a Centrifugal propeller. A video of it is posted on YouTube. I am within a couple of weeks from having a practical purpose prototype that will actually lift into the air. The Centrifugal Propeller will replace all jet engines, rockets, and most air and marine propellers. It will also be used for lifting purposes both commercially and domestically. It has no speed limit in outer space because it will continually accelerate.","246,859 followers",Dushka Zapata,14.6K,8.5K,232.5M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-impacts-of-current-and-emerging-technology-has-on-the-design-and-development-of-computer-games-to-meet-the-users-requirements-and-the-computer-games-industries
6,"No, why would it? Poor agricultural workers were very low status members of society, and when machines replaced them, they became poor industrial workers and remained low status members of society.When low skill / low status jobs are replaced by automation, new low skill / low status jobs emerge to occupy the available people.",UNKNOWN,Ben Y.

7,"Of course not! Did the dawn of the industrial revolution devalue the lower class as a whole? No, in fact it created more jobs for workers and encouraged everyone to develop new skill sets. When an innovation causes some menial task to become automated, it closes one door and opens up another. We need people to manage the new technology (in this case AI) and extend its uses into other areas of life. Don't fight change, embrace it. Better yet, help create it.",36 followers,Adam Ambrozy,579,0,0,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-impacts-of-current-and-emerging-technology-has-on-the-design-and-development-of-computer-games-to-meet-the-users-requirements-and-the-computer-games-industries
