10,"The German “Gepard” is such a technology. This self-propelled anti-aircraft gun was phased out of the German Army twenty years ago.With the advances in modern aircraft fighter technology, the Gepard’s twin 35mm autocannons lacked range and its radar also was outdated.A Gepard in a museum in Belgium. (Photo: Gunfire museum Brasschaat, Belgium)The Gepards were replaced by missile systems like the “Stinger” or the “LFK-NG” (new generation guided missile).Turn the clock twenty years forward and a new threat has emerged on the skies over the battlefields: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) or drones.AThe German “Gepard” is such a technology.

(Photo: Twitter)It turns out that the Gepards and other similar anti-aircraft cannon-based systems are the ideal weapons to protect a military unit or a base against these new threats.They might not be able to do anything against a fourth or fifth-generation fighter plane, but they can shoot down a drone in just a few seconds.","91,616 followers",Roland Bartetzko,6.4K,3.5K,314.7M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-upcoming-trends-of-innovative-technology
11,"Sure.The Canadian Army uses the Coleman stove and lanterns based on a design first sold in the 1950s. They could switch to battey powered lanterns and other fuel sources for stoves, but then they would not have heat sources for tents.The Canadian Army uses snowshoes and toboggans.

While there are snowmobiles and ATVs in service nothing competes with the absolute mobility and stealth of snowshoes.Artic tents used by the Canadian Army are at least a 50 years old design. While there are tents you can use to climb a mountain, non are as rugged as an Army artic tent (you pay for it in weight).Army field ration packaging has not changed much since the 1980s. There are dehydrated foods, but they don’t taste as good and they are a lot more expensive.They still have field phones with hand cranks. You can run out of batteries.Our machetes, axes, and shovels can not be replaced chainsaws and backhoes (we use them), there are not enough chainsaws and backhoes, the require fuel and maintance and there are not as mobile.Airborne forces still use static line parachute systems instead of free fall systems. The basic design dates to WW2.The Canadian engineer knife dates atleast the 1970’s. It is a great design.While we use GPS, I can not imagine a Canadian Infantry Senior NCO or officer leaving his house without a compass based on design from the 1950s.Like wise the Canadian Army will still issue whistles to infantry leaders who want them for signalling. Though most use a Fox40. At least a twenty year old design. Pen flares, about the size of a close pin, that use a spring mech to fire date back to at least to the early 80’s but maybe back to the 1950’s.Canadian assault boats look they same as they did in the early 1970’s.Some units still take manual typewiters into the field. They don’t need power and they secure from intercept.We still teach some of our soldiers to canoe.We use thirty and forty year old cross country skis.The M72 light anti-tank rocket (no ones uses it on tanks, but it is ok on light skinned vehicles near it is great for blowing holes through walls was used in Vietnam. It ain’t leaving the system anytime soon.The 50cal MG used by the Canadain Army dates to atleast the 1960’s. It is an awesome weapon.The Canadian Army uses a 50 year old thermos, a sixty year old 1 quart water bottle, a 30 year 2 quarter water bottle, and a 15 year old camelback.They use a forty year fresh food container system (metal not plastic) supplied by a fifty year field kitchen.They use the same stretchers they used during the Korean War.I am sure I can think of more if I took the time.There are, as others pointed out, three reasons for this. They are:There is a lot of equipment. It is very expensive to replace it. Armies focus on the biggest bang for the buck which usually means weapons systems, optics, radars, camouflage and things that will save lives (helmets, vests, medical equipment) before things that will make life more comfortable.Sometimes, primitive is better. It may be more reliable and stronger than the new tech.Third, sometimes, an Army designs the perfect piece of kit or adopts the perfect of piece of kit and nothing new can compete with it (assault boats, pen flares, army rations, hand crank field phones, and knives come to mind).","62,882 followers",Jay Bazzinotti,2.5K,22.2K,179.7M,2016,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-upcoming-issues-in-technology

My guess is AI – not the super-smart conscious thing, but the smart agent in your watch or your phone that will do everything for you that you do yourself, from booking a meeting to getting airplane tickets and order stuff for you.
