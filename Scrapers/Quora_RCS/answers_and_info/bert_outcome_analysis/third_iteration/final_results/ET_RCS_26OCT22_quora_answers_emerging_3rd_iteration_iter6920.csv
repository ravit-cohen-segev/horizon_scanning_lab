This is something wealthy individuals might afford while awaiting an organ transplant for example.Trust me, you don’t want to be Rip Van Winkle waking up after even a hundred years when everyone you knew is dead and gone, and everything you were familiar with has totally changed. Why even at age 65 I am sometimes lost with all the rapid changes due to technology, despite being a techie myself.","220,632 followers",Franklin Veaux,1.7K,47.3K,783M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-chances-that-in-the-next-50-years-humans-will-develop-successful-cryogenically-freezing-such-that-people-could-be-freezed-and-not-damaged-for-the-next-1000-years-or-so-until-technology-for-awekening-is

2,"I would estimate that likelihood to be close to zero.Yet: we would only know if the freezing works once we have awakened the first person. Who would want to pay for freezing if there is no guarantee if it does work? Ah, my failure: there will always be gullible people.",UNKNOWN,Bessie J.

4,"As a one-time control engineer, I am tempted to say “black magic”! It is mindbogglingly impressive, particularly when landing on a pitching and rolling barge with a deck only a little larger than your footprint.The rocket has to be controlled in six axes with a precision of a few centimetres. Clearly two of those axes are controlled by pointing the motors in two dimensions and a third comes from modulating the thrust. But that only allows corrections to be applied whilst the rockets are firing in three very brief bursts after payload separation. The other three axes are controlled by the grid-As a one-time control engineer, I am tempted to say “black magic”! It is mindbogglingly impressive, particularly when landing on a pitching and rolling barge with a deck only a little larger than your footprint.The rocket has to be controlled in six axes with a precision of a few centimetres. Clearly two of those axes are controlled by pointing the motors in two dimensions and a third comes from modulating the thrust. But that only allows corrections to be applied whilst the rockets are firing in three very brief bursts after payload separation. The other three axes are controlled by the grid-fins (which only work in the atmosphere whilst the rocket is still moving at quite high velocity) and cold-gas thrusters (which will have very limited control authority due to limited thrust and gas supplies).In order to apply these woefully inadequate control inputs, the position of the rocket (again in six dimensions - x, y and z of the bottom of the rocket, relative x and y of the top of the rocket, and the rocket’s rotation about its axis) have to be sensed to similar precision. Now, me, I’d have put a lot of equipment near the landing point and radioed instructions to the rocket. But as I understand it Musk ruled that out on the grounds that it would not work for the first landing on Mars, so as far as I know the rocket is self sufficient. Also you could cheat (as I understand Blue Origin do) by having a large landing area and concentrate your limited control authority on ensuring the rocket is precisely vertical and at zero velocity when it reaches some random point on the pad (relaxing the precision of two of the six axes). But that would not work on the barge.Robert Heinlein called this strategy a “hail Mary landing” - you fall out of the sky at terminal velocity and then spend the very last of your fuel in a high-thrust, last-minute burn to cancel the velocity at the last possible moment. Cancel it too early and you run out of fuel while gravity accelerates you again, leave it too late or your engine fails to light and … well probably best not to think about it!",10 followers,Andrew Forrest,870,6.2K,16.8M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-chances-that-in-the-next-50-years-humans-will-develop-successful-cryogenically-freezing-such-that-people-could-be-freezed-and-not-damaged-for-the-next-1000-years-or-so-until-technology-for-awekening-is
5,"Why are starship landings so difficult when SpaceX has landed so many boosters (SpaceX, rockets, SpaceX starship, booster, space)?The big differences between landing a Falcon 9 1st stage and the Starship upper stage can be summarised as three main factors. These boil down to engines, fuel, and orientation.The biggest and most obvious difference is the attitude that the Starship entry profile demands, which does something that no previous rocket has ever attempted, that is to quickly and precisely transition from a horizontal orientation to a vertical landing stance.

These boil down to engines, fuel, and orientation.The biggest and most obvious difference is the attitude that the Starship entry profile demands, which does something that no previous rocket has ever attempted, that is to quickly and precisely transition from a horizontal orientation to a vertical landing stance. This means that fuel and oxidiser that is always sitting nice and orderly in the base of the tanks in all other rockets is now sloshing around in a disorderly manner in the cavernous tanks of the Starship. This has necessitated the use of special header tanks to ensure the supply of a clean liquid flow which is vital for a liquid fuelled engine. Normal aerospace wisdom uses inert helium to ensure the correct pressures are fed to the engine’s turbopumps, but Starship is different in that it uses autogenous tank pressurisation where a bleed off from the engines is used to send hot gas back into the tanks in order to maintain correct operating pressure.Because the nose cone section of these early prototypes are empty, the oxygen header tank has to be mounted as far forward as possible in order to get the overall vessel centre of gravity correct, otherwise the craft would be too tail heavy. This of course makes things just that little bit harder to manage.Just getting the system sorted out to the point where it can maintain the correct fuel and oxidiser supply during this tricky manoeuvre was difficult enough on its own, but there are other complicating factors that have to be ironed out as well.The next big factors are the choice of fuel and the new engines. The Falcon 9 and it’s derivative use the trusty old Merlin 1D engine fed on RP-1 (basically highly refined kerosene) which has a tank pressure of just 3.5 Bar. The Merlin 1D is a simple open cycle gas generator engine (open cycle on the sea level engines at least) that has just the one turbo pump assembly that delivers both the fuel and oxidiser into the combustion chamber.The Raptors however are an entirely different kettle of fish. These engines are unique (in terms of flight) in that they are Full flow, staged combustion engines that run on methane. They have separate turbo pumps for fuel and oxidiser that have to be synchronised together and need a tank pressure of around 6 Bar to ensure adequate liquid flow to the pumps.In summary, you have a totally new landing technique where the vehicle changes its orientation by 90 degrees, using a new type of fuel that is burnt in new, complicated engines that have no previous flight record. Just to add a little spice, the vehicle is constructed in a manner completely different to anything else flying, and is built in tents by boilermakers.It can be a little difficult if you literally have to build the factory as you develop the prototypes, but this is essentially what SpaceX are doing.Considering the rate at which they are churning out these test articles, I think that you can excuse them the odd RUD. When you stop seeing these things disappear in a ball of fire the next phase of development begins.",2 followers,Leo Bruce,932,137,827.2K,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-chances-that-in-the-next-50-years-humans-will-develop-successful-cryogenically-freezing-such-that-people-could-be-freezed-and-not-damaged-for-the-next-1000-years-or-so-until-technology-for-awekening-is
6,"Because there isn’t a conveniently placed patch of land out in the middle of the Atlantic ocean. The Falcon 9 first stage doesn’t have enough fuel to fly all the way across the ocean to land, it has to come down where it does. It’s actually easier to do a powered turnaround and return to land at Florida, but that takes a lot of fuel to do, so they only do it when launching very lightweight payloads that leave enough fuel left to do the boostback burn to return to land. For anything large than that, the rocket doesn’t have the fuel to get back to land, so they have to land it on a barge.",5 followers,Jake Williams,9.9K,3.2K,76.6M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-chances-that-in-the-next-50-years-humans-will-develop-successful-cryogenically-freezing-such-that-people-could-be-freezed-and-not-damaged-for-the-next-1000-years-or-so-until-technology-for-awekening-is
