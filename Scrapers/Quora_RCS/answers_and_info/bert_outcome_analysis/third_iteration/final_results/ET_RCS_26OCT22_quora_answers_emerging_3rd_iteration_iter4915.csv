1,"It worked for the GOP in 2020. Remember, the party literally didn’t even adopt an agenda last year. They basically just said, “we’re going along with whatever Trump says”. And all Trump said was that “sleepy Joe Biden” was “campaigning in his basement” and that the things that were going on under his own watch were what would happen in “Joe Biden’s America”.
