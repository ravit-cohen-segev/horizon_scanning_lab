International agencies like Interpol? International governments like the European Union? An “interstellar government” like the Federation? They give me the willies. They leave me with too many questions. What necessitated the formation of the Federation, anyway? Why does it need its own president, its own legislature, and more importantly, its own military? Who is the Federation’s leadership accountable to? How much say do its members have, really? What mechanisms exist for punishing abuses of power and penalizing or removing the offenders? How effective are those mechanisms, and how often have they been used? How free is the average citizen of the Federation and how are those freedoms codified and protected? Perhaps most importantly of all, how is Starfleet funded? Who’s paying for all those shot-up starships in drydock to be put back together again?Even assuming that the answers to these questions would satisfy me, I justThe hegemonic nature of the Federation is problematic, too. Starfleet has shown itself to be perfectly willing to use force to subdue anything it deems hostile. While claiming to be all about peaceful coexistence and cooperation, the Federation sends an armada of heavily armed warships cruising through space, ready to blast anything that violates its statutes or threatens its interests. (I’m fairly certain there’s a Cardassian or two who has pointed this out.) The message seems to be “Our way or the highway,” with “highway” here having the meaning of “a photon torpedo up the bum.” This is exactly the same sort of criticism the United States gets for its force projection and so-called “peacekeeping efforts” worldwide. Why is everyone so willing to overlook gunboat diplomacy when a fictitious, snappily uniformed interstellar coalition does it?Starfleet is just…I dunno. Too iffy for me. When I enlist, I like to be sure that whatever I’m enlisting in serves a truly vital (and noble) purpose and isn’t merely a tool of oppression or banditry.

I have owned Glass for two years now and those buggers haven't implemented any usable solution to the cocktail party problem.Almost everyone these days uses a cloud based approach to this problem - which on paper is great, but UX is not as efficient as mechanical input - you wait for about a second or two and you are never sure if the result is going to be correct. In my experience, it gets all uncommon words (specially technical words - guess what the key early adopters demographic generally thinks about?) incorrect. If I have to repeat myself 5 times putting effort into adapting my voice for the machine to understand what I am saying, I really don't have any business claiming speech-transcription is solved.The core problem in the transcription business is that human communication is not a 1xN array problem, it is a MxN array problem - we use visual and psychological cues to infer context and speech. Since transcription algos don't use any of that data, those solutions are going to be forever inefficient.Another aspect is that all current implementations are just software driven efforts.
