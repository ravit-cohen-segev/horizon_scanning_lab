Mobility on these ships is measured not so much in max speed but rather in max acceleration. Also, the inside is built like a building, with “up” on the inside ceilings of compartments pointing towards what looks like the front of the ship, while the floor on every deck is pointing towards the 4 huge thrusters you see in the back.These are the most scientifically accurate ships, considering today’s technology (and a sort of logical evolution of it throughout the next couple hundred years)EDIT: OMG, over 3k upvotes.

The Expanse shows the kind of critical damage that even a small hole in a ship can cause, and it even shows the danger of colliding with debris from explosions and damaged ships.there’s a lot to talk about here…plants to produce oxygen, the fact that characters pass out in high-G acceleration, the vertical orientation of floors in relation to thrusters (for artificial gravity), etc. just great, well-thought-out ship designs.",2 followers,Julia Harris,4.8K,645,898.1K,2020,https://www.quora.com/Which-science-fiction-spaceship-is-the-most-scientifically-credible-based-on-current-technology-and-science

Vipers mk3 on “Battlestar Galactica”I actually debated trading places between this and the Starfury. The design doesn’t make as much sense as the Starfury, particularly around placement of thrusters. The three main thrusters are also ridiculously powerful for a craft of that size which makes no sense. There are also not a lot of room for ammunition, fuel, reaction mass, and power plant. With that said, it fires real bullets and more or less obeys real laws of physics when it is in real space.#3: Discovery in 2001 Space OdysseyVASIMR thrusters, elongated design makes sense for radiation shielding and for storing reaction mass, rotating section to simulate gravity, we can conceivably build this today.#2: All ships on “The Expense”Practically every tech in that show is plausible and physically accurate. If you are going to design an interplanetary spaceship it’ll probably look something like what you see here. Ships deck are designed like skyscrapers to take advantage of constant acceleration, which is exactly how you would travel between planets in the solar system if you have a fusion torch drive. Ships in the show have no energy shields, uses constant acceleration to simulate gravity, and ya bullets, rail guns and missiles. About the only thing in the show that took fictional liberty is the fable “Epstein drive” - a ridiculously powerful and efficient fusion torch drive that is probably not achievable in real life.#1: The Hermes on “The Martian”Everything in this ship is basically doable today if you have a trillion and a half dollars to spend.

Now apart from being an awesome ship from an awesome movie (the last act kind of goes off the rails but it's still great.) This ship could be shown in just about any “realistic” sci-fi show and I, personally, would believe it 100%.I think it's the design that does it, as well as showing us that, aside from the sophisticated AI, nothing about this ship is over the top, or unbelievable. It's engines are just normal, rocket fuel powered engines. They have sensors to send and receive radio and data transmissions, and even go so far as to tell us their range eventually makes them useless. The ship has an onboard “oxygen garden"", where water is recycled, and food is grown for the crew, which in turn provides the necessary oxygen they need for the trip, both too and from. Now I personally am no astronaut so I have no idea how to calculate the length of time needed to reach the sun, and then come back, but I imagine it's probably a fair bit. The ship is shown to spin around so that's supposed to account for the internal gravity. There's alot too it, like the ships computer needing to be submerged in coolant to keep it from frying itself as it runs so hot. There's alot of other little details that I just thought were super cool.All in all, to me, the Icarus II stands among the finest for absolutely believable ships in Sci-Fi.Sunshine is a great movie too, I recommend you see it, it's probably on Netflix so look it up, you won't be disappointed, and no, you may not borrow my copy, you never bring things back STEVE!!!!That's just my 2 cents, be safe out there.","220,648 followers",Franklin Veaux,3.1K,47.3K,783.2M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Which-science-fiction-spaceship-is-the-most-scientifically-credible-based-on-current-technology-and-science

You know we call ourselves 中国, which is ‘central country’ in English. Can you see the idea here? We are at the centre of the world, everyone else is surrounding us, we are the most important ones, something like that.

You can't make you better by comparing with someone who's far far worse than you, that is no point.Furthermore, to those who know China so less, I got to tell you that China is not just comparing with USA, in Chinese customs, there are only two nations in the world, one is our country 中国, another one is 外国, called ‘foreign country’ in English.

In general, Europe and Africa would focus their efforts on the African space elevators, the far east and Australia/New Zealand areas would focus their efforts on the Indonesian space elevators and North and South America would focus their efforts on the South American Space Elevators.Projects should probably proceed in parallel on sites chosen for maximum stability and minimum weather variance. Regarding weather, wind turbine should be placed near each site so that weather variance can be offset ny active stabilization coming from the power generated by the turbines. The Indonesian Stations should probably also be running tidal power systems.In regards to power systems, with the earth doomed, Nuclear power needs to get a stronger green light for earth's quick sprint to the finish line, and environment concerns that have more than a 50 year horizon should be abandoned in favor of powering the construction of the initial space elevators, and ultimately the full space stations.Inflatable structures should be used around the elevators to enable the building of massive protective zones around the space elevator cables. By having the structures be pressurized, rather than free standing, the material needs would be greatly reduced, and the potential sizes of the structures greatly increased.All (or as close to all as geo-politics allows) money formerly devoted to defense should be devoted to gearing up the R&D efforts.World Fusion efforts should declassify and combine forces.Genetic engineering should proceed with the goal of vastly improving the economies.The idea of keeping primitive people in the dark should be abandoned, and people who are trained as missionaries should be purposed to let these indigenous populations know that this world is going to end.Computer resources should be devoted to materials science and advanced molecular self-manufacturing, along the scales of automation that trees do naturally now. The idea is that we keep the elevators sending material up constantly, and the Geosynchronous outpost would be a location of non-stop materials assembly into space station structures.The idea of finding another habitable planet will be put on hold, for now. The arks (yes, more than one, many more) will instead need to be designed to be a permanent homes, but built on scales like we've never before imagined. As a result, a whole set of research projects that need to be spearheaded on earth aimed at producing permanently habitable space stations.And this is along with the research we need to do to get the space elevators off the ground (literally)And there will need to be re-engineering and organized on massive scales.*** After-thought addendum - The space arks themselves ***Several people answered about the need to find a new world, later. I'm going to contend that a set of arks, well-built, would be a better permanent residence, once fusion power was mastered, than earth itself is. So I think the plan isn't an ark, but a new, space-faring way of living in which we build enormous space stations, building the original scaffolds, and seeds, from materials lifted from earth, but filling out the space stations, possibly even after the impact destroys earth, from the materials available in the asteroid belt.So the concept is that these structures will, ultimately, be massive, on a scale that would eventually give us more usable land and ocean mass than the earth does now.So how do we build them? The same research I mentioned above into inflatable materials to build super-massive earth structures would also apply to the scaffolds used to build the space stations. The idea of using inflatable superstructures to build the early scaffolding of the space structures would greatly simplify a lot of the material requirements. This would facilitate the building of enormous superstructures on the ground while requiring minimal material. These structures could be rolled up like a bicycle inner tube, highly compact pre-inflation. And then inflated, once they in place up at the geosynchronous satellite. And since that satellite will be above the 23,000 mile basic orbit, they can use minimal active prolusion to be set free, slingshot like, off to the asteroid belt though carefully aimed to specific locations.As to how much air is needed, we live on the 21% partial pressure of oxygen. Plants don't do much with the nitrogen in the air (which is 78%) mainly just using the 1% CO2. One big savings would be to reduce the air pressure of structure from the sea level pressure here on earth, to 22%. This would reduce the tensile strength requirements of the scaffolding materials to handling 4 lbs per square inch rather than 15 in the non-weight bearing portions.With early successes at building super-massive superstructures, we could mine much of the material needed from the asteroid belt, rather than from the earth itself. And that could also act as a fall back plan should the space elevator approach fail some critical physical or technological limitation, that is, the building of massive inflatable super-structures that will act as scaffolds to be built up from the more gravitationally available material in the asteroid belt, might help to give us both super large, space cannons, and hyper-light rocketry.Ultimately, with the asteroid belt's material at our command, we could have many independent O'Neil cylinders that would have, in total, far more surface area to walk on than the earth has now. However, instead of walking in a situation where between yourself and the center of earth was 35000 miles of planetary layers, you'd be walking on a self-repairing (thanks to the Tree-like nanotechnology) floor that separated you from outer space by about 100 feet of material, the last 5 feet of which would contain the hydrogel like material Nasa researched for making meteorite impacts non-destructive (see comments).The interesting aspect is that, once this is underway, and we've began to master fusion, we could begin to be independent even of the sun itself, meaning we'd be well positioned to survive whatever happens to the solar system.A couple of points on power. An enormous amour of power, now, is used to generate light a night, heat when it's cold, and cold when it's warm. And a lot of our caloric needs come from fighting gravity, keeping warm, and breathing. Breathing in a 22% pressure, pure oxygen environment, and running at below earth's gravity levels might greatly reduce our initial needs while we master our new homes.*** end of addendum ***While this seems daunting, possibly far fetched, I have always been amazed at the speed with which World War II galvanized so many nations to achieve such amazing things, unfortunately for such a decidedly destructive purpose.And what the US was able to do in the 1960s, culminating with landing someone on the moon in an era when pocket calculators were out of the reach of the ordinary person, and computers were owned only by large companies, governments and universities.I actually think we could pull this off, if we had to, and save almost all of the able bodied people around the world.The Manhattan Project happened in a couple of years. The US space race in only 10, and this with technology and world-wide communication abilities that would embarrass a middle-schooler.And there will be a huge freeing up of resources if we don't have to be so much in fear of each other. I've always thought that the biggest impediment to our success in the world is that we've organized so much of it so that it is man verses man, and so little that it is man verses nature.I'm glad we don't have to do this, because there's a lot of great non-STEM things going on in the world, and war time economies are not fun. But I think it's something we could do if we had to. That's what we're really good at, as a species, doing what absolutely positively must be done, when we are given no other choice.",0 followers,Pranav N,9.7K,0,0,2018,https://www.quora.com/Which-science-fiction-spaceship-is-the-most-scientifically-credible-based-on-current-technology-and-science
44,"I would go with placing enormongous jets in the Antarctic to veer the Earth's course to dodge the proverbial bullet. And probably trigger some massive cataclysm on Earth due to an ungodly change in trajectory, thus killing us anyway. Hum... Sounds counterproductive.

45,"There is no plausible way (barring a miracle technological breakthrough that cannot be reasonably foreseen) to build, in just 40-50 years, an Ark ship that could make it to another star system with any hope of success.So don't worry about finding another habitable planet.The reason for this is durability and reliability.

The Ark Ship has to WORK for the duration of the voyage. Not just the physical aspects of the propulsion (you have to slow down when you get there), navigation (you have to make course corrections to get to the planet specifically), and life support, but also the social, political and economic structures which the people on board will have to live their multiple generations.Given the types of propulsion technology we could reasonably expect to achieve in 40-50 years, we are looking at a journey time in excess of 100,000 years. For comparison, the entire history of human civilization from the discovery of farming is 12,000 years give or take a few centuries.And you cannot plausibly expect anyone to be able to successfully design and build, in just 50 years, a complex system with maintenance contingencies that must function for a time period substantially longer than human civilization has itself existed. We simply wouldn't even have the context required to even try to plan for contingencies that only become likely after 20-30,000 year when we have no experience or record of civilized system enduring for more than a few thousand.Thus generation Ark ships to other stars only become plausible when propulsion technologies can cut down travel time to several thousand years at the longest, not tens of thousands of years, and in 50 years that's not happening, barring the aforementioned unforeseen miracle breakthrough.So tootling around the Solar System for several thousand years, possible. Leaving the sun's domain for another star, no.With that in mind, if we cannot deflect the asteroid, I think our best and most plausible chance is to simply put as many Ark Ships as we can into earth orbit.Unless this is a truly monster asteroid, the earth will recover from the impact faster than it would take for a generation ship to reach the nearest potentially habitable star system. And repairing an asteroid-damaged Earth back to a level where human survival is possible on the surface will likely be easier than terraforming Mars or Venus to a similar level.Staying in earth orbit means we don't have to spend time or resources building an interstellar drive system. Which means we can build more Arks, perhaps bigger Arks, and faster. It also means our life support systems on the Arks don't have to be absolutely 100% perfect, because resupplying raw materials from earth remains an option. Staying at 1AU means you don't need to absolutely require figuring out fusion, as you can use solar power.So, get off the planet, wait out the storm, then rebuild and resettle.",UNKNOWN,Viktor T.

47,"If an Earth ending asteroid were 50 years away, the only plausible response would be the project that I’m developing right now, except scaled up - time travel to the past. You don’t need an ark ship because all of the animal and plant species you’d be trying to save would already be there.The question would be where to go. I’m going to 1971. I have a plan. I’m even writing about it in my Quora blog,If an Earth ending asteroid were 50 years away, the only plausible response would be the project that I’m developing right now, except scaled up - time travel to the past.

I’m even writing about it in my Quora blog,The money would pay for a rapid, crash program on the scale of the Manhattan Project, to use technology that I already have and develop it create stable traversable worm holes to the past. Not the way I’m currently working on things, but we would need the ability to move massive construction equipment, supplies, personnel, trucks, military forces, etc. to the same location, which I’m not sure about, using the technology that I intend to use personally. That might be able to be developed so it could be used as well, but I have zero data on doing that, at the moment. I’m not trying to take anyone but myself and perhaps a few others, with no intention of coming back. However, for this situation, it’s totally different. It’s back to the finessed, brute force, using electrogravitic, high velocity rotating fields exhibiting teleparallelism, model.We would need to do the R&D on how to open multiple wormhole openings that would connect to the same region and time so that we could get ships there, air craft, etc. and it would have to be done quickly.This wouldn’t be everyone just goes and starts again like the pioneers. I’m talking about the reestablishment of our civilization, done better, just back in the past. I don’t know what everyone else in the world would do because if the Italians or Germans or Egyptians, etc try it, they will interfere with the development of what would be their own history. Not that it would change what we know of how history developed because all time travel to the past involves parallel universe copies of the past. But they’ll have to get over the fact that the Roman Empire would never rise there or Ancient Greece. Essentially, it’s the idea of grabbing Earth at a time when (at least in North America) that no one was really around and starting over with all our stuff.I’d say 10 years tops to be ready to go and 10 to 20 to get everyone out that would be going. I’d have construction experts, energy, communications, etc. working on what they would have to do to get everything operational. I’d need economists to do the work on how to restart an economy that would have to be based on a slightly different model but better. We’d have to figure out how to get as many businesses replanted as possible and ways to get as many people self-sufficient as possible. The world economy will be gone. Businesses that rely on foreign customers will be hurt. What do you do? We’d have to figure it out, way in advance. I have some very good ideas but clearly, the powers that be would need experienced input. Obviously the government already has their continuity plans established. They’d have to modify those plans for the new, grandiose situation.It would be a massive effort, even just the planning and it would be going on while me and teams of physicists, electrical engineers and others, started building designs and doing experiments to see if what I already suspect will be possible - if we scale up the technology I have already, to force micro wormholes to stay open longer and larger, with the hope being thatThe big problem is who gets told and when? How many do you really try to save? Do we tell our enemies? I’d say ‘no’. I wouldn’t be telling N. Korea or any number of other countries that I see as being all out enemies. But it wouldn’t be my call. After everything was handled,These are the kinds of things that I run through my mind all the time instead of the stuff that everyone else does, although this is the first time I’ve thought about transplanting American civilization. The other idea I had was how to go to the past and mine for precious metals, minerals and energy resources before anyone else was there. Like in China. All that stuff that China has that we need, we could get from the past without affecting them now and they wouldn’t even be aware of it! So it’s not that big a deal to use that information, in terms of logistics and planning, and equipment, and scale-up the operation and include the element of population transfer.In any event. If it works, it would be a hell of a lot faster, cheaper, easier and save more lives than trying build a space ark. As I get my other projects advanced, I will keep in mind the applicable research that I would have to do to answer some of these questions, and just do the research in order to have that knowledge base.","105,673 followers",Dave Consiglio,566,6.8K,91.6M,2017,https://www.quora.com/Which-science-fiction-spaceship-is-the-most-scientifically-credible-based-on-current-technology-and-science
