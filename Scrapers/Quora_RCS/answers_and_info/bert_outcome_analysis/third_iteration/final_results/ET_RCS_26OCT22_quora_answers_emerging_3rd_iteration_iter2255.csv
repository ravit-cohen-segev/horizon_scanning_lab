Chinese Companies have access to the 940 Million market and prevent any other company from accessing the market especially Google or Facebook. Primarily the reason for this is becauseThe only investments China allow - are building factories for manufacturing - which allow job creation, more money, creation of a middle class.In Short - China ensures that their Manufacturing Industry receives all the Investments to ensure that Maximum Development of the Country takes placeThis creates Giants like Huawei, Tencent, Alibaba etc - who thanks to 4–5 years of Chinese Market -IT IS A LONG TERM SUCCESS MODELTHE INDIA MODELThe India Model is also simple. Short term, Short Term and Short term and using the Media to cloud up any issues involved.There areThere isSo the only investments we have come fromThis creates a huge dependence on Foreign investment for Service Industry equivalent to ourAs a result- 10 years from now - India will still be hailing investments from Google or Facebook whileIT IS A LONG TERM FAILURESo the answer as to why Facebook and Google come to India is simple -As a result - in the future- China will have Big Companies to compete with Google and Facebook while India will simply have kowtowed to Google and Facebook.","31,156 followers",Phillip Remaker,1.7K,11K,78.8M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Does-any-big-company-like-Google-or-Facebook-invest-in-blockchain-technology

And seeing that the cats and our place were all fine, I didn’t make a big deal out of it.“Have you heard about Bitcoin?” he told me.“Bit-what?!”So I read theI was a mergers & acquisitions lawyer at the time.Attorneys make whole careers based on the premise that you can never prove that something happens. They bend and twist the truth in the way that most suits the needs of their clients.But this blockchain, it was something else.“This is the first time in history we can verify that something happened at a definitive point in time without depending on an intermediary,” I thought.Until then, records of transactions had to be kept with a 3rd party and would be suspect to tampering. But with blockchain, trust is safely spread out.Another way to look at is by understanding the Byzantine Generals’ Problem. Several armies surround a city. If they all attack at the same time, they can triumph. If they all retreat at the same time, they can save themselves.But anything in between, and there’ll be death. A lot of it.It’s the fundemantal human problem of trust. One general can tell the others that he’ll be attacking, but they can’t know it for a fact until they themselves either attack or retreat.Blockchain, on the other hand, is a public ledger recording transactions with timestamps on a vastly distributed network of computers. If one person decides to tell a different story, they won’t be able to.Too many records on too many nodes will prevent that.Revolutionary.Blockchain naysayers aren’t rare.When email was invented, they said it’s too impersonal and people would never use it. Phone companies used to state that no one would ever communicate over anything but a phone line. Traditional media believed banner ads wouldn't be effective in comparison with printed ads.They were all wrong.And here’s the point.Blockchain is already powering technologies that are transforming our livesIn healthcare, it’s being used to track the progress of patients after they leave the hospital. In finance, cryptocurrencies allow for effecting payments in a non-centralized way and without the control of central governments. Smart contracts are changing how we do business and reducing bureaucratic hoops. Precious gems are being monitored to ensure they’re free of child labor and tyranny. Even governments are using blockchain to increase efficiency.How wide-ranging will blockchain’s implications be?Stick around and you’ll find out.",215 followers,Sameer Gulati,898,0,0,2018,https://www.quora.com/Does-any-big-company-like-Google-or-Facebook-invest-in-blockchain-technology

Additionally, as a graduate student / TA, I became involved with a female undergrad student in one of my study sections. Thus, I have experienced the teacher/student affair from both the subordinate and authoritative perspectives within an academic setting. As others have well-stated in their answers, affairs between teachers (professors, TAs, etc.) and students are generally and necessarily prohibited.I could go “anonymous”, but I have little concern surrounding these matters. Rather, I hope my experiences will be useful to others for a variety of possible reasons. Such issues are currently contorted into the male/female power struggle and need to be addressed honestly and rationally.I was a naïve 20-year-old undergraduate who tested high but had never been given much direction or reason to feel motivated. I gravitated naturally to work with an extraordinarily bright and attractive young female professor in her mid-30s. I was very excited for an opportunity to study science (molecular biology) and quickly became her top student, working late nights in the lab on her research project that ultimately led to a co-authored publication. I, a small-town boy, had never known anyone (man or woman) so high on the spectrum of intelligence and achievement. This was before affirmative action and other props for women in STEM; she wasn’t equal, she was far better than other members of the faculty at this small college. I was in awe of her.Long story short, one day I was in her office - probably to discuss research results - when she suddenly threw her arms around me and tearfully revealed that she and her husband were splitting up. She felt sad and alone. She invited me over to her house for dinner that night; she needed to talk to someone.As stated, I was naïve. I went to her house with the sole intent of comforting her due to genuine concern. It turned into the first of many nights we were to spend together.It was fantastic! She did her teaching during the day, I went to classes and loved working in the lab, then we’d meet at her place for dinner where the topic of conversation was always science in one form or another. I learned so much that would not be available to a typical undergrad. This was back when recombinant DNA technologies were being worked out - it was an exciting time for molecular biology. She was on a national committee to draft safety guidelines for molecular cloning, so she was privy to the latest research in the field. Every day was exciting and filled with new ideas and goals.When the day was done, we’d retreat to her over-sized bath or sauna and chill together. Did I mention she was sexy? We enjoyed each other in every way. It was a splendid situation and we were both very happy to be alive and functioning in the world.We held our integrity. I told her that I didn’t want any special treatment (professionally or academically); she informed me that I should not expect any. I am confident that I well-earned every word of every letter of recommendation she wrote for me. It’s more likely she held back some to conceal our relationship.Eventually, I left for grad school, but we maintained a close friendship for several years after.The other romantic situation within a teacher/student relationship was more typical in that I was the older and more empowered participant. I was a TA (teaching assistant) in physics for premeds. I was a very serious grad student and she was a very cute, soft and bouncy Asian undergrad who seemed to adore me; she came up to flirt with me after every class and seemed to run into me frequently outside of class. I was going through a phase where Asian women simply did it for me - and there were lots of them at Berkeley to taunt my primal instincts. I honestly tried, but I could not resist. She was too damned cute, too sweet, and she had goo-goo eyes for me. In contrast to the brilliant professor described above, she was an average student, so the roles were reversed as she required lots of tutoring from me :-).No need to go into much detail here. We eventually moved in together and she followed me for my postdoc; we were together for 7 years. There was never anything improper at the academic level; she wasn’t overly-concerned about her grade and, as a mere TA, I had little to offer her there besides some extra personal attention (though premed physics never held our attention for long). We had a nice relationship and I still have very fond memories of her.So, why do I write about these two very personal relationships that took place within a teacher/student setting? I want to reveal firsthand that such relationships don’t need to be corrupt or exploitative. They can occur quite naturally without salacious intent. They can be wonderfully compelling, completely innocent, and of benefit to both parties. I particularly want to point out that these things are not always initiated by men to exploit leverage over less-empowered women as current popular dogma espouses so generally.The concern in the past was that the subordinate party would benefit unfairly in a competitive environment with other students - generally suggesting that most often women benefited by relationships with (commonly) older, more empowered men. Feminism and the #METOO movement have flipped this story line. The complaint these days is that the empowered party (invariably male) is the beneficiary due to exploitation of the less empowered (invariably female) “victim”. My experiences illustrate that neither needs to be the case though any such situation can be easily characterized insidiously.My stories are not intended to entice anyone to cede to love (or lust) within a teacher/student relationship. In the light of today’s culture, little imagination is required to envision either relationship ending much differently - even horrifically - with lawsuits, firing and total humiliation. So, yes - affairs between teachers and students are not to be recommended and can certainly not be condoned or tolerated administratively.While I bask in the good fortune to have such memories to cherish, I need to state that teacher/student relationships were never considered to be OK. Yet, they were not uncommon and, if found out, were managed without a grand jury inquiry. Trust and integrity issues span a spectrum of human behavior and hold the potential to cross a line in the mind of another. Certainly, issues of trust and integrity make or break any relationship and violations, real or perceived, lead to many of the serious problems that face us today.",0 followers,Alice Baker,610,12.4K,183.4M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Does-any-big-company-like-Google-or-Facebook-invest-in-blockchain-technology
