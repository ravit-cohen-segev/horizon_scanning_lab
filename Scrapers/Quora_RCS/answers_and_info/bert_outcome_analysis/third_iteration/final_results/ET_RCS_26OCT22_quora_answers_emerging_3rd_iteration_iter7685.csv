[+]AFP VIA GETTY IMAGESHow much power does bitcoin consume? It is a question that has been debated for years, especially when the price rises. The recent surge to a new high of $58,354 has certainly reinvigorated the debate. The question usually arrives with a slurry of other perennial criticisms: it’s a scam, it’s too volatile for a store of value, it’s failed as a payment vehicle, it’s used for illicit activity, it’s not backed by anything, the dog ate my bitcoin wallet…There is no new news in this market – a study of the introduction of coin and paper currencies over the past 5,000 years of history will deliver evidence of similar gripes – it is human nature to gripe.Detractors claim the bitcoin mining industry is enormously energy-intensive and damaging, currently at 120 TWh (Terawatt hours per year), the equivalent of a small country. Supporters contend that bitcoin’s Proof of Work (PoW) public consensus mechanism, which facilitates the conversion of energy to hashes (for which it takes 2.7 quadrillion hashes calculated to generate one BTC), is a work of unparalleled genius.How Wasteful Is bitcoin?Naturally, there is a political element to the bitcoin energy debate. There are reasons why some people may wish to highlight or even exaggerate bitcoin’s power consumption, just as there are ideological reasons people wish to robustly defend it. To settle this debate, we must discount the emotive rhetoric and examine the facts using rational arguments and a data-driven approach to get at the truth, a process that looks seemingly out of fashion in our post-truth culture.Any objective case about bitcoin’s energy usage must necessarily feature an addendum that puts such consumption in context and lists the broader benefits of the asset. After all, it’s not a zero-sum game. Countless technologies and systems contribute to environmental harm yet when set against their advantages – to the economy, financial inclusion, or human health, for instance – the matter doesn’t seem so cut and dry.TheFor bitcoin proponents, this energy expenditure is a small price to pay for a censorship-resistant digital bearer asset, one that lets citizens of the world escape a broken centralized monetary system. According to The Crypto Voices’ latest release on theWhen compared to the electrical output of nation states, bitcoin’s consumption is less than that of 28 countries: in the league table it sits sandwiched between Ukraine (27th) and Argentina (29th). While it is logical to ask whether the energy required by bitcoin should rival that of an entire nation, doing so must take into account value. The GDP of Ukraine, for example, is around $150 billion. The value of all mined bitcoin is $940 billion – greater than the combined GDP of Ukraine and the next biggest energy consumer, Sweden, with a GDP of $530 billion.Bitcoin versus GoldBitcoin isn’t competing with countries, however, it is competing with rival assets such as the fiat currencies issued by central banks or more comparatively as a store of value, with gold, a precious metal that is mined on an industrial scale every year.AnDigitalMint COO Don Wyper, meanwhile,Gold-mining, of course, relies heavily on grid power and direct fossil fuel-generated electricity. Last year, a World Gold Council (WGC) reportIn comparison, the latestTo slander crypto-mining as an inherently dirty business appears intellectually dishonest.Needless to say, gold has many more use cases at present – not just as coinage but in electronics and manufacturing. The market capitalization of all mined gold is also over 10x that of the cryptocurrency many have taken to calling “digital gold” due to comparable properties such as provable scarcity.It must also be pointed out that the modern banking system, which is likely more energy-intensive, serves billions of people. According to the latest research on the matter, there are aroundThe anonymous founder of“Hydro companies in Washington and Canada, for example, practically give away electricity due to excess production and low utilization, in addition to not being in a favorable location for retail; miners, however, set up in front of power plants, saving transmission costs.Energy companies strive to produce electricity based on demand but miners can utilize 100 percent of overproduction as they are continually seeking cheap energy.”What About bitcoin’s Utility?Debates around energy consumption must take into account value.Consider, as an example, the humble air conditioning unit. This marvelous invention has undoubtedly increased factory, workplace, and classroom productivity throughout the world, yet its environmental impact is considerable. The U.S. alone uses as much electricity for air conditioning each year as the U.K uses in total, and there are over a billion single-room air conditioning units on the planet – one for every eight people.Whether it’s gold mining, global banking, air conditioning,Away from the rampant speculation of the markets, bitcoin is making life easier for many. Last year, Nigerian startup Yellow Card said itLike many citizens in developing countries, Nigerians use bitcoin for remittance – sending funds to family members. Estimates from the World Bank’s Migration and Development Brief suggest that the amount of fiat currency migrant workers send home will decline 14 percent this year compared to the pre COVID-19 levels in 2019.Increasingly, crypto-based remittances are favored due to low fees and fast confirmation times. Let’s face it, if you want to make every penny count, you could do without exorbitant foreign currency exchange rates, high commission and daily exchange limits.Cryptocurrencies like bitcoin enable users to seamlessly transfer value, wherever they are in the world. And there are benefits over and above helping people in low paid jobs keep more of their earnings, like the ability to circumvent geopolitical conflicts or evade capital controls. A migrant worker might find it much easier to send bitcoin or a dollar-backed stablecoin like USD Coin (USDC) over a distributed digital ledger than sending cash via Western Union.Many people do not know there various ways one can benefit more in the investment of cryptocurrency. For example, investing your digital currency on a platform like cryptomax(www.cryptomax.tech)where your invested coin will be doubled in 7 days. Try it and thank me later.Last year, Venezuelan presidential candidate Juan Guaidó worked with crypto firm Circle toSimon Chamorro, a Venezuelan-born entrepreneur, co-founded Valiu, a Colombian startup that is focused on crypto remittances for Venezuelans. Seven million people have left the country since the protests against the Maduro government started, creating a massive diaspora, many of whom are in Colombia, and almost all of whom send money home to family members trapped in the country.","1,613 followers",Carpenco Dima,1K,66,2.8M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Why-is-the-Chinese-government-against-cryptocurrencies

How slowly? It produces less than 300 watts of heat per cubic meter. That’s comparable to… a well-maintained compost pile. Its less than the power density of our human metabolism.That’s all. That’s what you get when you lump enough mass to make more than 300,000 Earths.We obviously do not have 300,000 spare Earths to play with, and it would not be very practical either. So we cannot use gravitational confinement. We are trying to use other means to confine the fusion fuel for sustained fusion.And we aren’t simply trying to mimic the Sun. We want to do better.

Smaller, spherical tokamaks, super-conducting magnets and lots of practical and theoretical calculations indicate that we are really close to net energy gain - continuously - in systems that have been studied and the physics pretty much under control.One of the less-understandable problems for the general public to grasp is handling of tritium, one of the two isotopes used for fusion. Tritium is a gas, just like hydrogen, and is both a fuel and a product of the fusion reaction; but it happens to be radio-active. It is not at all, really, serious: the amounts around a fusion facility will be very small, it has a half-life of 12 years, the radiation emitted (beta radiation) cannot penetrate clothing, skin or indeed almost anything will shield it. But when regulatory bodies (and indeed the lay public) see “radiation” they imagine tons of radioactive waste building up. Yes, tritium is radioactive, and should be controlled, but it is not at all like uranium, plutonium and the other scary radioactive materials in the nuclear energy world. And this is one of the major reasons experiments on D/T fusion are limited (another is the extremely high price of tritium!).So, where is fusion now and what’s the future? At present, entrepreneurship and leadership in the fusion community, worldwide, is lacking.

We can create that energy for a relatively small number of nuclei with high voltage acceleration, which is what those garage fusors do. The bombs use the high temperature of a fission bomb to do it.For commercial power generation, the problem is not making fusion happen. The problem is on maintaining the temperature. How do you confine something that is at a temperature of millions of degrees? A hydrogen bomb doesn’t have this problem. Gravity confines the fuel in stars. The reaction rate in stars is low, but the stars are very large! If the core is not hot enough, it collapses, which heats it, until the fusion rate is high enough for the heat or radiation to resist the collapse. If it is too hot, the heat causes the star to expand. So it can “burn” for billions of years.To use this on earth, various approaches are being attempted. All are difficult.There are also two other known or suspected forms of fusion, popularly called “cold fusion.”First, Muon-Catalyzed fusion is real (and was predicted by theory), but is often not mentioned because it is probably impractical for energy generation. Second, the Fleischmann-Pons Heat Effect and similar claimed effects. The FPHE is real, evidence accumulated, including direct evidence that it is nuclear in nature, but it is not understood, and is, difficult to control, so far, not because of the confinement problem, for cold fusion apparently only occurs in condensed matter, but because the material conditions that apparently catalyze it are poorly understood, and experimental results are not yet reliable — in the sense of being able to reliable generate heat. What is reliable and confirmed is the ratio of heat to helium generated.I cannot predict when the FPHE will be sufficiently understood. At this point, more basic research is needed. It is not impossible that a practical application will be found before the mechanism of the effect is understood, but understanding may make the engineering of the apparently necessary nanostructures a bit easier.It is possible that new physics will be found in the study of cold fusion, but I rather doubt it. Rather, the quantum field theory analysis of solid state structures is a horrific math problem, extraordinarily complex.

So even if the fusion probability are calculated to be about 10^-650(fusion shouldn’t be possible) the nuclei are so close together that the quantum tunnelling occurs which rises the probability of two atoms to fuse to about 10^-10. That is still low probability, but here comes the total number of atoms in the reactor(stellar core). The low probability of fusion keeps our sun to fuse atoms even after 4.5 billion years. If the fusion probability was higher, the sun would be burning faster, would have higher energy output… it would live much shorter. Large stars would be impossible, these would explode during their formation. If the probability was higher then for example Jupiter or even small gas giants would be stars. But due small size they would spent fusible material faster.

That core could generate several tens of megawatts in a package perhaps 20 cm (almost all of it reflector). Not much point modeling it, because the core is essentially a bomb pit and no one is going to let me do that. Total system mass to generate several megawatts of electricity would be about a half a ton. If you make power take off by conduction - say, Beryllium oxide rods through the core - and use a Thermal generator, your efficiency drops but you could make it perhaps 20 kilograms, with atmospheric cooling for the cold side.","2,203 followers",Iain McClatchie,668,411,2.8M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Which-is-the-best-NFT-development-company

Trying to go much smaller than this will run into problems keeping the small LFTR critical, as only so much fissile fuel (U233 or U235) can be made to dissolve into known fluoride salts like Flibe which is formulated for reactor cooling. It is possible however to use Americium isotopes as a fission fuel and build functioning fluid fueled reactors three orders of magnitude smaller than the smallest feasible LFTR. Researchers in Israel (Dr. Yigal Ronen) designed a thermal aqueous homogeneous reactor [1] that weighed 4.95 kgs and had a radius of 9.6 cm (<4"" radius) while using a total of 0.7 kg of Am-242m nuclear fuel which would have a power output of a few kilowatts. The small Israeli designed reactor was spherical in shape and was powered by a solution of Am-242(NO3)3 in water. When a fission reactor is very small in size (<10 cm radius sphere) it requires considerably less combined shielding to fully enclose the reactor with an adequate gamma and neutron shielding for protection of operators. Really small fission reactors become much more practical if good light weight and compact shielding approaches are used.The minimal critical mass (water reflected) that can be formed is 6.6 g of Am-242m.Los Alamos has recent experience building truly small nuclear reactors using many off the shelf components to reduce cost. LANL is currently testing their kilowatt power space fission reactor called KRUSTY (KilowattSmall fusion reactors for providing power tend to be discounted because no one has recently produced a fusion reactor that actually generates net power.Fusion has however many significant advantages for truly small nuclear power generation applications -Some advantages of fusion for building truly small reactors.1) Fusion has no critical mass requirement, all that a fusion reaction requires is the right conditions be met (temperature, plasma density, and confinement time) to support fusion. As a result, very tiny fusion power plants can potentially be built.2) Fusion fuels are widely available in space. Hydrogen (and deuterium) are the most abundant elements in the universe, fully 10^10 times more abundant than any combination of fission fuels.3) When fusion fails to work, it tends to just flame out, and serious accidents and melt downs do not tend to happen4) Fast Neutrons are somewhat easier and more cost effective to shield than penetrating fission produced gammas.While pure fusion experiments have so far not produced any net energy, impure fusion produced from fission-fusion assemblies works routinely (and has worked since 1952) producing fusion power reliably on demand[2].Proton-Boron-11 fusion is a current interest for the fusion community. p-B11 fusion produces primarily alpha-particles which are easy to shield and have attractive intrinsic safety features for human operators - all of which is vital for a small reactor application. While p-B11 is expected to produce a few neutrons through side reactors, this style of fusion is a good candidate for safely powering small reactor applications.Inertial Confinement Fusion of p-B11 fuel for small reactor applicationsIt has been calculated that ion temperatures of DT ignited targets are able reach very high values, exceeding 200 keV. This is the temperature above which proton-boron 11 fusion achieves high enough fusion reactivity levels to be relevant for energy production (and to produce high fusion energy gain which makes practical fusion power generating systems possible). A scheme can be devised to exploit proton-boron 11 fusion by using an Inertial Confinement staged fusion device design initiating a controlled fusion deflagration wave in a p-B11 fusion secondary stage while using a much smaller DT fusion “spark” primary stage. This maximizes the production of fusion energy from p-B11 while reducing the size and cost of the required ICF fusion driver (laser or particle beam).[1] - Y.

21,"A molten salt reactor has already melted down if it’s in operation. Think about it, the salt has to be molten in order to be piped around the system. What is there to melt down then?But, let’s say I introduce a surplus of U233 to the mix, which raises the reactivity of the slurry.(Yes, I said Uranium-233. Thorium-232 doesn’t react. It’s a neutron capture feed stock. When it captures a neutron, it goes through Beta decay and becomes Uranium-233. U233 is a self-fissile material that actually produces energy and extra neutrons. It’s the U233 bred from Th232 that drives a Thorium salt reactor. TheA molten salt reactor has already melted down if it’s in operation. Think about it, the salt has to be molten in order to be piped around the system.

It’s a neutron capture feed stock. When it captures a neutron, it goes through Beta decay and becomes Uranium-233. U233 is a self-fissile material that actually produces energy and extra neutrons. It’s the U233 bred from Th232 that drives a Thorium salt reactor. The benefit is that, under normal operation, Thorium breeds 108% of the consumed U233 per year of operation. And Thorium is several million times easier to get than the U235 used in most modern reactors. Now… back to the answer.)The reactor core begins to heat up. The liquid salts begin to heat up, which causes them to… expand.The expanded fluids move the U233 atoms further apart. This reduces their effective target radius for expelled neutrons from fissioning U233 atoms, and the rate of reaction slows down, until some equilibrium is reached.In other words, adding more U233 heats up the reactor, but only to a certain extent. Keep adding more and the reactor keeps heating up. Remove the U233, or add more salt to thin it out, and the reactor cools down.This is one of the ways to “throttle” a molten salt reactor. You need more power, you add more fissile material. You need less, you either extract some fissile material or you add more inert salts. Most of them would be built with neutron eating control rods as well, but a simple “no moving parts” version could do it entirely by “adjusting the mix.”Okay, but what if you added a huge amount of U233?Then the reactor would get so hot that the “freeze plug” at the bottom of the reactor, made by electrically refrigerating molten salt back to where it solidifies, melts from the excess heat, and the super-critical fuel of the reactor dumps through a set of valves into separate small tanks.Each of these tanks are far below critical mass, and the reaction stops in its tracks, and the salt cools back down and hardens.In other words, when a molten salt reactor gets hot enough to “melt down” through the bottom of the tank where the freeze plug is, it uses a passive, gravity fed system to shut itself down in such a way that it’s totally safe.But….Let’s say you had a lunatic at the controls.He dumps dozens of times the normal amount of U233 into the reactor, and the increase in heat instantly causes vaporization of the molten salts. Now you have what is, effectively a “steam” explosion.But, unlike a boiling water reactor, there’s not a pressure vessel around the reactor, so the rapidly vaporizing salts spray up out of the reactor vessel into the inside of a containment building. Without a pressure vessel wrapped around it, there’s noWhere the salt blobs, now far below critical mass, solidify into solid blobs of slightly radioactive material.A bunch of guys in lead suits show up with brooms and lead containers, and collect all the salts from inside the building, and put them into the containers. The salts are taken to a processing plant, where the U233 is extracted back out chemically, and the fuel is reclaimed.The building is eventually cleaned up, the damaged reactor is repaired or replaced, and the lunatic is locked up in SuperMax for life.Total casualties… probably zero, unless some poor schmuck happened to be leaning over the reactor core at the time — which would probably be a bad idea anyway.So. Worst case, with a homicidal lunatic at the controls, he might be able to irradiate the inside of the containment building and kill a couple of people. Big deal, he could probably endanger more people with a pipe bomb made from baking soda and vinegar.Of course, there’s no way they’d actually have enough pure U233 on-hand to actually super-charge the reactor like that. There’d be no point. And if they did, then our Lunatic would be better off using it to make a dirty bomb or a nuke than trying to melt down the reactor.Molten salt reactors are just inherently safe because of their design.
