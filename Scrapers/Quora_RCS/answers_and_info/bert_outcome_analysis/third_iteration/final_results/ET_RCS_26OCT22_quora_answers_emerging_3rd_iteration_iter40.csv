This is your product and services.To bring value to a business client, you will need to know their business. That’s why you need business analyst skills. You will need to put down your developer hat and wear a business hat to talk business with them. This is how you sell your product.Finally, most of the time you are delivering some kind of finished product to your clients, unless you are the true kind of consultant who charges $500/hr for advice only, then you will need to manage your timeline and activities. How you do this, what methodologies you use, means shit to the client - they are only interested in when and the quality. This is how you deliver your products and services.To start your career in tech consulting, the big players are your best choice. But don’t stay too long. Get out to different technologies and industries. Stand out on your own. Make clients know you and not your company. Don’t be worried about hopping jobs too often - any consulting firm is more than happy to just chuck in a senior consultant from somewhere and throw it in the client’s face for $1000 a day.After u have done some years in those big firms, hop on to smaller ones where you are more visible and “naked” - where you will have to wear multiple hats to the client - programmer, tester, project manager, account manager, etc. Where there is no one else to escalate to when shit hits the fan. This will grow your skills as a consultant and make yourself valuable to future clients and even employers.Of course, you can still stay in the big four and enjoy a nice cushy career for the rest of your life. There’s nothing wrong with that - you are paid well and you have job security. but if you want to be a true consultant, go out and see the world.",256 followers,Priyal Gupta,9.7K,0,0,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-are-top-technology-consulting-companies-in-Singapore-or-in-the-world

2,"Hah! This. This is what I fight against. This is the windmill I tilt against.Top technology companies pay no particular attention to recent graduates. They’ve already hired most of their incoming cohort by the beginning of the students’ respective senior years.I regularly see nonsense like “high grades” or “top schools”, but you’ll see MIT students rejected and CSU Monterey Bay students hired, and they almost never even ask about grades.You can start working toward your career whenever you feel like it, but the top students started as freshmen.
