It is often the unseen tools to make these artefacts that are more impressive than the artefact themselves, a calliper is hugely important for standardisation, engineering and geometry. A seal of this precision would not be seen again until some time after the age of enlightenment. Its detail is comparable with early banknote plates (around the C18th CE). The section below is approximately 10mm in view size.No, these optical lenses…Similar dating, Mount Ida, Crete, ca 1400 BCE, however, this may be when the lenses were stored in the Caves of Minos. Made from precision ground rock-crystal (natural glass), see what I mean, with a dividing compass (callipers) one can create an arc to create a lens and critically measure the arc to improve; in this case: optics.Hang on a minute, maybe these white-hulled ships…Santorini (Thera) before the eruption of 1628 BCE. The reconstruction team thought they used flax linen cloth in pine resin (a natural thermoplastic) with limestone powder to make the hull white (a composite matrix) over a wooden frame. The reinforcement is shown inside and out, if the hull is compromised on rocks, it will delaminate, keeping the hull watertight to make landfall and repair, saving the crew, ship and cargo. Glass fibre composites were invented in 1950’s COMMON ERA. Flax is almost as strong in tension.No this…Later bronze casting currently in the Met Museum, NY, ca 700 BCE from originally Samos, Greece. It's the closest thing I’ve seen to what Daedalus’ glider may have been. An airframe! If the fabled account of Icarus is correct: the remains of his glider were found at IcariaWe have little idea of what technology the Minoan’s really had, most of it has decayed and is lost to time. The Athenians kept the white hull ship Theseus returned in, it was on display for centuries as a trophy of Athens increasing power. According to myth, Theseus tried to secure magnetite and got thrown off a cliff on Skyros, a source of Magnetite! Athens didn’t know how to make another white-hull, they fell out of use, it is sufficiently advanced that they were unable to reproduce it.A communication network across the Aegean? Well, they had one according to Homer, the fall of Troy was reported to Argos in a few hours using island fire beacons (Peak Sanctuaries which have line-of-sight between them and are present throughout the entire Aegean), e.g. a message relayed at a few hundred miles per hour using long-distance signals, fires at night, gravity cast flat mirrors called Labyrs (double-axe) in the day.Peak sanctuary above. Note all the measuring devices!Kit checkBlind embossing printing: Check. Money (Palace gold tokens): Check. Sewers, flushing toilets, interlocking clay pipes with injectors to remove debris, aqueducts, tunnels straight through mountains, hot and cold running water to upper stores. Check, check, check, check, check and check. Are you getting dizzy? All of these things are technically demonstrated in the mid second millennium before common era and were (largely) lost in Bronze Age collapse to be rediscovered often centuries and in some rare cases many millennia later.The fingers. The (Idaean) Dactyls:What is shown above is miltech from the Bronze Age and it makes advanced research agencies of today look like they are playing at it! We should have been on the moon at the beginning of the common era on this trajectory. An enlightenment had already happened before the common era, then an island erupted (1628 BCE), then the Mycenaeans invaded (1450 BCE), then Bronze Age Collapse (1225 BCE): the world had gone very badly wrong and took a different course…What can we not understand about Minoans?And if its prehistory, this…Oldest obsidian bracelet reveals amazing craftsmen's skills in the eighth millennium BCA short time after this, this…“Bird-man”.

The boss, is the thumb: Herakles (position), and likely the artist is referred to this on the first seal, the only people that would realize this are those with a lens inspecting the seal!This is all hidden in plain sight. The Dactyls are the Quartermasters to those perceived as Gods. They made the tools, machines, weapons and systems. One hand is male, the other female. They built the most extraordinary things: transformative technology and systems.Administration may be the glue of civilization, but it is the technology that increases efficiency and with that increased output. Without technology, we would never be able to support such truly huge populations of today and we would otherwise still be living in the stone age, all 7 million of us; three orders of magnitude difference to the actual population of today: 7 billion and counting.These technologies (particularly the old ones) are critical enablers: calendars, machines and platforms to facilitate increased trade in surpluses giving prosperity.

Just like iron (and mild steel) rusts, any metal can oxidize. However, aluminum oxide is impenetrable to oxygen. Which means, if you make a thing out of aluminum, and then the surface of it oxidizes, the inside will remain completely pure. There will be only a thin layer of aluminum oxide over an interior that is pure aluminum.I chose aluminum because (unlike iron) heat, gravity, and pressure, are not enough to purify aluminum.Frank Duncan's answer to How is the aluminium purified?To summarize: the ore (called bauxite, for some reason; which is a mixture of aluminum oxide and iron oxide, and sometimes other stuff mixed in) is dissolved in sodium hydroxide. The aluminum oxide dissolves, but the other stuff doesn’t. Then some chemical stuff is done to make the aluminum oxide precipitate out of the solution. Then the aluminum oxide is put into a chamber with two carbon electrodes, and a very strong DC current is run between them. The electricity causes the oxygen in the aluminum oxide to move and bond to carbon from one of the electrodes, forming CO, which is then further oxidized into CO2.I go into all of this detail to show that it is absolutely, completely, totally impossible for any combination of lightning, volcanic activity, or anything else, to make pure aluminum. If we dig up even one single aluminum item, that would prove that ancient people were as advanced as us.“But what if they just didn’t use aluminum?”. Nope. Sorry, any advanced society would ALWAYS use aluminum. How many aluminum items have you been within 20 feet of in the past week (even in Coronavirus quarantine)? I would guess over 1,000. Because aluminum is REALLY useful. Immensely, unbearably, accept-no-substitutes useful. I would risk saying that any society which does not use aluminum is not actually advanced at all.And, as I said above, aluminum does not rust away. If there were advanced ancients, there is 100% certainty that they would have made things out of aluminum, and those things would still exist. We would be digging them up.But, even with all of the lots of digging that modern humans have done, for mines, for building foundations, for tunnels, for underground utilities, etc, we have never found a single piece of ancient aluminum.Now lets talk about plastic. If aluminum is useful, plastic is 10x more useful. Think about how many plastic items you have in your house right now. That isn’t an accident. They are there because you needed a tool to accomplish a certain job, and plastic was the best material anyone could make that tool out of. (Don’t think that an Aquafina water-bottle is a tool? Storing and transporting water is a job, and it is impossible for a human being to do without some type of container, like a clay jug, or an iron pot, or a plastic bottle. Why do you think we are no longer using clay jugs or iron pots?)And, if aluminum is durable, plastic is 10x more durable.If ancient societies were advanced, they would have left piles like this behind, for us to find. Not a bottle here and there, huge mounds like this.Plastic is just too useful to not use.People have been using bio-plastic for for over a thousand years. The three major sources are sumac lacquer, beetle lacquer, and cow horn.Of the three, cow horn was the most easily available, and decently useful, but not good enough. If you boil a cow’s horn in water, it become soft, and you can bend and shape it, and then it will harden again when it cools. But you can’t pour it into a mold.Sumac lacquer is made by boiling down the sap of the sumac tree, the problem is that this releases a horrible neuro-toxic gas. The technicians who did this suffered from horrible chronic pain, and gradually increasing paralysis, until they eventually died young. But the material was so valuable that people did that job anyway! Once you have boiled the sap down enough, you have a type of plastic which can be used to make all kinds of useful things, and reheating it to melt it after initial boiling is way less poisonous.Beetle lacquer, also called shellac, is made from the egg nests of the female lac beetle. She secrets this substance to lay her eggs in. The nests can be scrapped off of the trees that they are laid on, and melted with heat, to make a useful plastic. If you wait until the baby beetles hatch before you scrape up their nest and melt it down, you will have a limited amount of shellac for an unlimited amount of time. But in the 18th and 19th century, global demand for plastics grew so great, the people started harvesting lac nests before the baby beetles had hatched! The species was almost driven to extinction.Then petroleum plastic was invented, and the poor beetles were spared. Today their numbers have fully rebounded. Some amount of shellac is still harvested, for restoration work, and historical reproductions, and for people who just really like making things in the old style. Almost all of what is now harvested is used as finish for wood furniture.But there was a time when it was used for hundreds of different applications.An object made from any of these types of bio-plastic can last for 1,000 years… if you keep it dry, and out of direct sunlight, and don’t cook it. But if you bury such an object in the ground, or let it sit out in a yard, or try to store it anywhere in a tropical climate, then it will rot away in a few years.But petroleum plastic is forever. The plastic bottle that you just drank 20oz of Pepsi out of could still be in existence when the sun explodes. You think that “diamonds are forever”? Ha! A diamond is a mere blooming flower, fading before the frost, compared to a plastic gateraid bottle. Or electrical wire insulation, or pair of cheap sunglasses, or… the list could go on and on. If your romantic partner wants you to get them something that will last “forever, just like our love”, do go for a diamond, go to Home Depot and pick up 6″ of insulated electrical wire. If your partner actually appreciates the joke, they’re a keeper.All of this is to say, if ancient cultures had been advanced, they would have made a lot of stuff out of plastic, and most of it would still exist. But not only have we never dug up a single piece of ancient aluminum, we have also never dug up a single piece of ancient petro-plastic. Not one.This answer has already gotten REALLY long, and I haven’t even talked about concrete (Advanced civilizations make things that last forever. We can be certain that there never was one on this planet before, because if there had been, they would have left some of that stuff behind.",0 followers,Lucas Martin,6.4K,65,4.2M,2021,https://www.quora.com/When-did-advanced-technology-begin

The US nuclear power plants are by far the safest way to generate electricity, and always getting safer. You’re far more likely to be injured or dieMany will like to point out that the spent nuclear fuel will be radioactive for thousands of years. That’s because the nuclear reactors commonly in use today only use about 5% of the available energy during their 18 month operation time. Yes, nuclear power plants are typically refueled every year and a half. Once they’re refueled they just run. Many plants operate for 98% or more time producing electricity, shutting down only to be refueled (when extensive inspections and necessary maintenance take place). Modern monitoring systems can detect radiation at a far lower level than would pose any danger to life, and extensive reporting helps insure proper management of the plants.However, as good as the current “fleet” of nuclear power plants is, there are far more advanced reactor designs in existence. Many of them can even use the spent fuel from the existing power plants, taking a waste resource and putting it to good use. Small, modular reactors promise to lower costs by allowing for assembly line production of the plants.

The sun creates two main types of energy – light and heat – that can be harnessed for many activities ranging from photosynthesis in plants to creating electricity with photovoltaic (PV) cells to heating water and food. PV or photovoltaic power or CSP otherwise known as concentrated solar power which is used for solar heating.For most of human existence, the cooking of food was unknown. Food was eaten in the condition it was found- often raw and spoiled. Through trial and error, humans found that fire could be controlled and used to cook food, as it is essentially solar power stored in the form of wood. Considered in this manner, solar was the first method of cooking on earth.The beginnings of solar cooking, can be traced to several isolated instances in the distant past. The Essenes, an early sect of Jews, gently heated wafers of ground sprouted grains on rocks heated by the desert sun.Solar Cooker TechnologiesIn time, others turned towards solar cookers. The “hot box"" style solar cooker created by Horase de Saussure, a Swiss Naturalist in 1776, was capable of reaching temperatures of about 190 degrees and used in cooking fruits.In India, a British soldier patented a fairly sophisticated solar cooker that looked a lot like the solar chef, which is described below.Today's solar cookers began evolving in the 1950's.History of solar cookingOne of those global problems was the growth of deserts around arid communities. The United Nations and other major funding agencies initiated many studies to design solar cookers that could alleviate some of the reliance on plant life for fuel. Many top engineers of the 1950's were hired to study different aspects of solar cooking designs.The UN then sponsored studies and programs to introduce these cookers into cultures where the need was most apparent.The study did reveal one success. In a northern Mexican community lacking fuelwood, they found that the cookers were still in use five years later. this showed that it was possible to get cookers out to people in need.Cabrito in South TexasPiercing rays of light beamed down on the Chilean village of Villaseca as Luisa Ogalde placed a pot filled withIn another box nearby Ogalde placed rice, which she said would take 40 minutes to cook, and dough, which would need about an hour to become bread.Restobar Solar Entre Cordillera (The owner and executive chef at Restobar Solar Between Cordillera, which opened in 2018, relies upon a set of eight boxes, solar ovens that work by heating meat the same way a parked car heats a human on a hot summer day.Ogalde uses the solar ovens to make other traditional stews, including beef- or chicken-based""We're rescuing all of the old recipes of the area and giving value to the homestyle foods of our grandparents,"" she explained.Yet, while the recipes may be old, the way of cooking them is brand new- a unique melding of past and present.Chile's sun-baked Atacama Desert is known as the driest place on Earth (Ogalde belongs to a generation of cooks who have opened solar restaurants in remote parts of Chile's sun-baked Atacama Desert, which begins just north of Villaseca, ends at the Peruvian border and is known as the driest place on Earth.In a growing trend, increasing numbers of chefs across northern Chile are using solar ovens to cook traditional foods (The movement began decades earlier when Francisca Carrasco (Ogalde's mother), a goat farmer in Villaseca, became a solar cooking pioneer.The goal of the study was twofold. Researchers wanted to help families in this isolated patch of the Elqui Valley to rise out of poverty with a free source of energy, but they also wanted to find a way for them to cook without deforesting the few remaining algarrobo, churqui and carboncillo trees for their traditional wood-burning stoves.Naked Albizia TreeVillaseca transformed into the first village and eventually centralized starting point in Chile to use solar power for cooking, opening countless possibilities.At first it was just people cooking for their families, but foreign tourists began to arrive in greater numbers, asking to see those who cooked with the sun. Over time, participating families made key observations that helped them perfect this new style of cooking. The parabolic solar cookers, they noticed, concentrated heat extremely fast and were a great replacement for things you'd normally do on a stovetop, such as boiling water. Meanwhile, the box-like ovens could both slow-cook stews and replicate a traditional oven for baking bread and deserts.Delicias del SolIn 2000, the association opened its first solar restaurant, Delicias del Sol, with capacity for 24 guests.Qori Inti: El renacer pandémico del restaurant que cocina con la energía del sol - La TerceraIn the tiny desert oasis of Pica, on the far northern end of the Atacama, Ruth Moscoso runs the solar restaurant Qori Inti, which means ""radiant sun"" in her native Aymara language.""In our culture we have a strong environmental awareness,"" Moscoso said. ""So, we said, let's do something that takes into consideration our traditions and our customs of caring for Mother Earth, but also our tradition of being thrifty and optimising what we already have here, which is sun and heat. So, it's really a convergence of tradition and innovation.""The vast majority of Moscoso's ingredients come from her network of local Aymara peopleEating Traditional FoodMoscoso is now innovating again with a special type of solar oven that cooks food inside a glass evacuated tube, which absorbs sunlight and turns it into heat to quickly bake or roast items normally cooked in a traditional oven.-However, one significant difference with this particular style of cooker is that it does not have a real large coking interior compared to that of a box style or panel style solar cooker and regular pots and pans cannot be used at all in this kind of cooker.GoSun Stove Evacuated Tube Design Solar CookerWith the help of a regional grant for small businesses, she purchased six of these solar cookers earlier this yearIn the Chilean capital Santiago, new startup Antu Cocina Solar is launching a similar tube-style solar cooker developed under a circular economy model that benefits both users and the environment by turning plastic waste into a pollution-free appliance for everyday cooking.Clearly, the importance of solar heating and cooking has been overlooked in the archaeological record. In modern times,, solar cooking has remained an under utilized source of energy favored by necessity in the past. Chefs, restaurant owners and those barely eeking out a living highlight the importance solar energy as a renewable source of energy in harsh, fringe and war-torn environments . The recent popularity of solar heating and cooking technologies must seem comical to those who have relied upon them for millennia.","220,602 followers",Franklin Veaux,12K,47.3K,782.8M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-most-advanced-technology-common-people-dont-know

Usually you have to either hold down F2, press enter 10 times, do a backflip, to the right now y'all, one hop this time, and it will enter recovery mode. This is mainly for trying to restore Windows to a previous version, or recovering information if the computer breaks.Remember that, too.Lesson 3: When you use Windows, even if you don't have to enter a password, you are signed in as a user. Each user has specific access rights and privileges. For example, Administrators usually have more access to system files and settings than regular users do.Ok, so here's where I got in trouble.I'd come into the computer lab during lunch to dink around, play flash games, etc. because I didn't have a computer at home. Eventually, I got my hands on a flash drive that I downloaded games like Goat Simulator and Gmod and the like during lunch breaks. The problem was: I was a student, and the student accounts on the computers were not able to run programs directly off of removable media. So, in order to play my games, I'd have to copy the files over to the computer and run them from there. The other problem was: the school computers had Deep Freeze installed on them, so I'd have to copy them back if I wanted to save my progress.That copying/pasting took way too long.So I thought,But Deep Freeze will revert any changes made to specified drives on the computer whenever they're rebooted, which happened automatically every night. So I could either disable the automatic rebooting and risk some dumb kid turning my computer off accidentally, or I could disable Deep Freeze.*cracks knuckles*I tried deleting the program files for it, but it wouldn't let me. I did some research, and this is where I learned Lesson 3. So I made myself the owner of the Deep Freeze folders, then deleted them.Nice.Except, when I went back to school the next day, it was back.This is where I learned Lesson 2. It was a bit more difficult on the school computers, but I was able to get the computer I was on into recovery mode. Since the “user” that accesses system files in recovery mode is technically the computer itself, it had permission to make any changes it wants. I tried deleting Deep Freeze from here, hoping it wouldn't be reinstalled the next day. Sadly, it was.…Now I did not come to this next conclusion on my own (I think I followed some long-lost YouTube tutorial). But I did figure out how to implement it in this specific situation.When the computer is in recovery mode, since it's mostly there in case of emergency, most Windows features are stripped away (like the basic file explorer), and you're basically left with nothing but a command line. But a command line is a very powerful tool, if you know the commands.Since I didn't have a file explorer, and trying to open one just opened another command line, I opened notepad. Then, I pressed “File”, then hit “Open”.Boom. File explorer. But what good is a file explorer, you ask?To which I reply:With the computer under the assumption that I was trying to open a text file, I navigated to the System32 folder and located sethc.exe, and renamed it to something else (I think it was sethcq.exe or something). Then I found the command line exe (cmd.exe).Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V.I now had cmd.exe and cmd (2).exe. I renamed cmd (2).exe to sethc.exe.Now we're cooking with grease.I rebooted the computer, and since Deep Freeze didn't see anything wrong, nothing was reverted. On the login screen for the computer, before I was even logged in, I press Shift 5 times, and a command line comes up.Success!Using that command line, I made myself a full admin and gave myself full rights to everything. Then I deleted Deep Freeze.Next day, it's back on.I came to find out that there was a program running on a network drive that would reinstall Deep Freeze if it was uninstalled. I didn't even have permission to give myself permission to edit those files, so it seemed like I was stuck. I was an admin on this computer, but I didn't have the login for the network drive.Then it hit me: the computer has to be connected to the network drive in order for the network drive to make any changes. I couldn't disconnect the drive from the computer, butI still didn't have the login for the drive, so what I did is (and keep in mind, I've been doing all this in chunks of 45 minute lunch breaks) I downloaded a full, clean .iso of Windows, burned it to my flash drive (which meant I had to delete all my games, rip. But it's for the greater good), and booted the computer from the flash drive instead of the hard drive. I reinstalled Windows on the hard drive, and voila!The teacher came out, and I was instantly banned from the computer lab.Lesson 4: don't get caught :PEdit:So a lot of the comments suggest I should've just installed my own OS on the flash drive, and they're right. I just didn't think of doing that. The problem I was trying to solve at that point had changed from “how do I play games on the school computer” to “how do I delete Deep Freeze.”","14,230 followers",Saran Udayakumar,2.4K,1K,29.3M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-most-advanced-technology-common-people-dont-know

The benefit you get from that is if one piece of the system goes down, the rest of it can stay up, and so the user never knows that anything’s broken.There are a lot of problems with redundant systems, though. The first one is that if everything’s running the same software, the odds are pretty good that a bug in the software that makes one instance crash is going to make all instances crash. This is why we do something called “canarying”: deploying a new version to a small subset of machines and watching to see if they exhibit any behaviors that didn’t show up in testing, and then gradually rolling them out to more and more machines.That’s a good approach, but it introduces a whole other kind of complexity, which is what happens when the nodes of a distributed system are running different versions of the software at the same time. This means that you’re never adding just one feature to a piece of software: Not only is version X+1 going to have your new feature, but it also has to have the feature that it doesn’t break version X.And that’s assuming that your software is a monolithic black box that runs in isolation. Which it isn’t.Almost all software running at scale is built from services. Your program doesn’t read and writes data directly, it does it by communicating with another service that does that work. (For instance: to a first approximation, all data at Google is encrypted before being written, and is written to many different physical locations in the same operation. When I write a program that writes data, it’s just sending that data to the service that does all that magic for me.)When your program depends on other services, its functioning depends on program changes that you didn’t make. For instance, if the team responsible for the database service fixes a critical security bug, they may change the behavior of their service in a way that your software was depending on not changing.In this environment (especially), failure is inevitable. The important task is making recovery from failure fast and efficient. Software deployments are failingIt’s possible for distributed systems to failTo prevent that, an enormous amount of effort goes into code review and integration testing so that vulnerabilities like this can be found before they go into production. We overprovision our systems, giving them more computers than they actually need. We spend a lot of time monitoring the software they have running live to see if it’s behaving the way we expect it to be behaving.The simple solution to all of this is to stop developing new products and features and stop getting new users. Of course, that’s also the simple solution to the problem of staying in business, so we don’t do that.",256 followers,Priyal Gupta,9.7K,0,0,2019,https://www.quora.com/When-did-advanced-technology-begin
