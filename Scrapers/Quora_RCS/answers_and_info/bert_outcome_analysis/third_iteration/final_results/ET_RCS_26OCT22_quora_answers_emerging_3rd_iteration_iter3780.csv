Lower cost increases in health care spending. You can find more atAnd what did Pres. Obama say would happen after the passage of the ACA?“The plan I'm announcing tonight would meet three basic goals:“It will provide more security and stability to those who have health insurance. It will provide insurance to those who don't.Obama’s Health Care Speech to CongressEdit:The Kaiser Foundation does an annual survey on employer based health insurance premiums. It shows that premium increases after the ACA were lower than before the ACA passed.Average Annual Workplace Family Health Premiums Rise Modest 3% to $18,142 in 2016; More Workers Enroll in High-Deductible Plans With Savings Option Over Past Two Years“This year’s low family premium increase is similar to last year’s (4%) and reflects a significant slowdown over the past 15 years. Since 2011, average family premiums have increased 20 percent, more slowly than the previous five years (31% increase from 2006 and 2011) and more slowly than the five years before that (63% from 2001 to 2006).”There’s one good reason that so many people below object that their health insurance costs much more than it did before the ACA. That’s because it DOES cost much more than it did before the ACA. How can that be true at the same time that the studies above show lower total cost increases? One reason is because a 4% increase in a big number is a bigger raw number than an 8% increase in a smaller number.If your health insurance cost $4,000 per year in 2003 and the cost went up 8% for the same coverage in 2004, your new cost is $4,320. If your health insurance costs $10,000 in 2015 and goes up 4%, your new cost in 2016 is $10,400. Which is half as big as the increase you would have faced if costs were still going up 8% a year but more in total dollars than the costs went up in 2004.However, employers are doing more to cut their share of the costs of health insurance so, even if the premiums have gone up “only” 4%, employers are shifting more of the premium cost on to employees and insurers are increasing deductible and co-pays so that the insured are paying much, much more than they used to. If an employer was covering 90% of the premium in 2003, the employee would have paid only $400 a year. But most employers have cut back their share of the premiums they cover so, if in 2016, they’re covering 80% of the premium, the employee is now paying $2,080 instead of the $400 they spent back in 2003. So, it definitely looks much worse for the employee even though the cost increases in health care have gone down a lot.That leaves the other mechanism insurers and employers use to force costs on to the insured: deductibles and co-pays. These are not the result of the ACA, these are the ways the US health care system has chosen to shift the burden of increased costs onto the insured under the theory that the insured will “shop” for the lowest cost care. This has never worked in the real world.In reality, the use of deductibles and co-pays are a financial punishment for becoming ill. The theory that actually informs these policies is that if you make people pay for becoming sick, they will avoid becoming sick. If breast cancer or kidney cancer or emphysema are covered 100%, why would people avoid having those conditions? It apparently isn’t enough to suffer the ill effects of cancer or other diseases. The only real way to make people stay healthy is to charge them high amounts of cash for being sick.The US spends, on average, twice as much per person for health care as do other advanced economies. And we do that while leaving tens of millions without access to health insurance. We could cover everyone in the US for the amount of money we already spend on care, it would just mean a radical reform of the health delivery and payment systems.The ACA wasn’t radical reform, it was incremental. The people who object most to the ACA are also the people who are, usually, the most against radical reform and universal coverage. That’s a contradiction that I can’t solve.",347 followers,Steve Hirsch,774,243,355.5K,2019,https://www.quora.com/Can-medical-kiosks-cut-down-the-cost-of-healthcare-Will-pushing-for-implementation-of-medically-advanced-technologies-save-Obamacare

Note the AGM-88 HARM (High-speed Anti-Radiation Missile) missiles. This plane is armed for a SEAD mission.All of this is important to achieve air supremacy, where your aircraft can operate at will, anywhere they need to. Fail to do this, and the kinds of missions you can do are very limited, because of the danger of enemy SAMs limiting your flight profile. For this reason, and to attain expertise in many other types of missions, Western pilots get somewhere between 200 - 240 flight hours per year.By contrast, Russian pilots get only 100 hours per year. According to some estimates, it’s as low as 80 hours. That’s barely enough to stay current on things like landing an airplane. It’s not nearly enough to fly an extremely dangerous SEAD mission and survive it.This isn’t really the plane’s fault, and it’s not really the pilot’s fault either. Most this stems from the rampant fraud and graft in the Russian armed forces. There isn’t enough money to buy the expensive jet fuel for pilots to get the flight time they need. And Russia hasn’t really ever ran into a situation where they had to fly against their own air defense systems. They just never planned for it.

The NLAWS and Javelins have been very effective at destroying Russian tanks, armored vehicles, supply vehicles. And the various MPADS have done a great job of preventing Russia from achieving air superiority.The one we hear about the most here in America is the Javelin, but that’s a local bias, that one, we sent.

The problem is, you can’t roll main battle tanks and infantry fighting vehicles off the conveyor belt like sausages (I know, showing my age by paraphrasing Kruschev). Now under western sanction, the tank factory has had to shut down for lack of the specialized (western) equipment.Third, the Russians are begging the Chinese to supply them with equipment and ammunition - which the Chinese have not done, so far. Does this sound like a nation with a large stock of combat munitions?And finally, and perhaps most importantly, the Russians are running out of men. They began the war with 185,000 troops dedicated to the invasion of Ukraine. Sound doctrine states you need at least a 3:1 superiority if attacking, and at least a 4:1 superiority for an occupation. Ukrainia has roughly 200,000 professional soldiers and another 300,000 in the Territorial Defense forces. So Russia needed a MINIMUM of 1.5 MILLION to attack Ukraine.Why didn’t they send more? Because they don’t have them. OK, I know - more than 900,000 men in the active duty Russian military, plus up to 2 million in the reserves. However:-50,000 troops are tied down in the Strategic Rocket Forces, whose only job is to lob nukes-145,000 troops are in the Aerospace Force, divided between the Space forces, the Air Defense troops, and the Aviation troops. Other than roughly 2,500 pilots involved in attacking the Ukraine, these forces are not available for what is a ground war.-165,000 men are in the Soviet navy, which is spread across 7 time zones. Only the forces of the Black Sea fleet and the Caspian flotilla are available for operations against the Ukraine; other than the roughly 2,500 troops in the Naval infantry brigade, none are available for direct ground operations.-40,000 troops are in the Airborne forces. Considered Russia’s elite, these troops took a shellacking in the first 3 days of the war - pardon me, “Special Military Operation” - and haven’t been used much in the last month.-There are an unspecified number of troops in the Special Purpose Troops, probably around 5,000, but the Ukrainians have aggressively been tracking down and obliberating any sent to the Ukraine. So far, they have not played a significant role in the war.A very large number of troops, up to 225,000, are assigned to the Material & Technical Support branch of the Russian armed forces. These are organized into four arms: the Maintenance troops, Railway troops, Pipeline troops, and Military Construction troops. These men are not trained or available for combat. The Russian army is having enough trouble supplying fuel & ammuniton (forget about food!) to their frontline forces as it is; imagine what happens if you take all those truck drivers, fuel haulers and mechanics out of the picture and turn them into poorly trained, ill-disciplined cannon fodder?So, Russia had roughly 280,000 combat troops available 24 February, and sent 185,000 against the Ukraine. Remember, Russia has to keep viable combat forces in place at several locations - Chechnya, South Ossetia, Georgian & Armenian borders, and Syria for instance - and are thus unavailable for use against UkraineRussia has lost at least 15,000 dead, which means another 30,000 wounded (and about 15,000 seriously wounded and requiring evacuation). At least another 7,000 (probably more) have been captured or have surrendered, meaning Russia has taken 28% losses so far, and it’s only going to get worse.Russia recently announced that 60,000 reservists would be activated, implying that they would be used in the Ukrainian War. However, a Russian reservist is NOT the equivalent of a western reservists. European, Canadian and American reservists periodically train, work with their active duty counterparts, and are taught the emerging and updated skills needed for modern warfare. Russian reservists for the most part are simply a list of those who have completed their active duty service and who will be recalled as needed. Very few have had any refresher training; by now most have families and careers and will be less than enthusiastic about fighting Ukrainians.Russia is also in the middle of their annual conscription cycle, meaning another 134,500 men must be recruited and trained. By law they would replace the conscripts currently serving their 12-month compulsory service, who would then be released from active duty. Also by law, conscripts will NOT be sent to Ukraine to fight. That ain’t gonna happen; the current conscripts will be kept on active service and the new recruits, once trained, will be sent to fight. You think any of the current conscripts or the incoming class have any enthusiasm for the fight?Also, it takes 6 months, minimum, to train a recruit and place him in combat. Three months to access and equip a soldier and get him through basic military training, and another three months to complete his specilization training (tank driver or infantryman or artillerymen, etc). And even then, the new conscript is NOT a soldier; he has to fit into the unit organization and survive combat long enough to gain experience before he can be of real use. A lot o conscripts are going to be sent to fight after 3 months abbreviated training, and will suffer accordingly.In the meantime, new weapons - sophisticate, modern weapons - are flowing into the Ukraine daily, the Ukrainians are gaining valuable combat experience, and are in no danger of running out of soldiers any time soon. Every Russian attack against civilians just firms the resolve of the Ukrainians to resist and makes them more determined to kick the Russians out. Compromise? The Ukrainians are winning and they know it.Back to the original suppostion: yes, Russia is running out of weapons, out of soldiers, and out of time.Sorry for the long reply.","115,113 followers",Daveed Phoenix,5.8K,9.9K,160.5M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-do-you-think-of-this-tweet-from-Donald-Trump-I-want-the-United-States-to-win-through-competition-not-by-blocking-out-currently-more-advanced-technologies-We-must-always-be-the-leader-in-everything-especially

18,"I cannot think of a realistic scenario in which Russia could gain an advantage by using nuclear weapons in Ukraine. The war there does not lend itself to the use of WMD. Russia is claiming to care about Ukraine, claiming that the Russians and Ukrainians are one people, if they used nuclear weapons and killed hundreds of thousands of their own people it would make it clear that they don't see Ukraine as part of Russia.","29,925 followers",Tomaž Vargazon,2.9K,7.7K,249.7M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-do-you-think-of-this-tweet-from-Donald-Trump-I-want-the-United-States-to-win-through-competition-not-by-blocking-out-currently-more-advanced-technologies-We-must-always-be-the-leader-in-everything-especially
