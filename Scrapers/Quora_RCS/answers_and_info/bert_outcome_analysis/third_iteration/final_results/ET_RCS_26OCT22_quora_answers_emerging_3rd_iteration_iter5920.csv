It exposes you to different ways of thinking about and approaching problems.Rather than making your skills shallow and unfocused, it should be exposing you to new insights and broadening your perspective.The industry is large enough, and the work plentiful enough, that you can easily choose to specialize. That’s what I’ve done. I still try to dip my toes into areas outside my specialty, for exactly the reasons I mentioned above. Meanwhile, I also have worked on honing my craft.I aim for a T-shaped skill set here: A broad, if somewhat shallow understanding of a wide range of topics, and a somewhat narrowerMight I suggest you find a specialty to drill down on, so you can start building the trunk of your T.Note:The main point is that if you feel like your knowledge and skills in a particular area remain unfocused and shallow, it’s because you haven’t tried to","44,319 followers",Kurt Guntheroth,10.3K,13.7K,167.3M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Are-the-smartphone-emergency-alert-to-find-Ahmad-Khan-Rahami-post-NYC-weekend-bombing-a-fair-use-of-technology
7,"No. Rarely have I seen a conspiracy theory that’s so totally upside down.The tech giants are extremely conservative about their programming language choices (and about new tech in general unless it’s something they invented). They have huge codebases in existing languages, like the performance of their tech stack to be predictable and are focused on work that addresses core business needs (that’s one of the reasons they became giants).

The smart ones choose new tech becauseThe less smart ones do it without that careful thought and they usually fail. Some people are less smart; what can you do?The giants aren’t threatened by these startups - the successful ones usually end up being bought by the giants who profit from the new ideas whose value they have proven. The startups also bring more skilled people into the industry, whom the giants then often poach.Otherwise, new programming languages these days are taken up by the open source user/dev communities that form around them. Some of these people are entirely new to the field; their participation skills them up and grows the pool of recruits - good for the giants. Some of these people work for the tech giants - this is only a problem if it eats into their day work, otherwise it both improves their skill set and potentially improves the reputation of the employers.","129,190 followers",Jessica Su,1.2K,1.5K,49.7M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-are-interesting-undergrad-thesis-topics-in-the-area-of-emerging-technologies
8,"No.Languages are created by programmers or by companies typically when they want to be able to do something with a programming language but it is either impossible to do so or extremely clunky/inefficient to do so.Java for example was made because Gosling wanted something that could handle concurrency in a simpler way.

10,"I think that, at the corporate level, it’s normal practice to dumb down everything in an attempt to make employees replaceable, so that the company can survive the normal comings and goings of the people who make it up. So many languages and practices appear to me to be little more than fads, and differ very little from each other fundamentally. In fact, in the early 70s there was a lot of talk about programming as we know it disappearing soon, but 50 years later, it’s still basically the same. None of these fad-type languages and practices can make programmers out of non-programmers, but by GI think that, at the corporate level, it’s normal practice to dumb down everything in an attempt to make employees replaceable, so that the company can survive the normal comings and goings of the people who make it up.

11,"I don’t know about elsewhere in the world, but dairy cows in America are probably treated the best out of any livestock here. They get to live in warm, comfortable barns, eat good food, and are generally handled with care, because an unhappy cow is likely to become a sick cow, and you can’t use milk from a sick cow for anything. Some modern farms even let the cows decide for themselves when to get milked; they have automated stalls where they can just walk in and have a snack while the machine does its thing, then walk out.

They get to live in warm, comfortable barns, eat good food, and are generally handled with care, because an unhappy cow is likely to become a sick cow, and you can’t use milk from a sick cow for anything. Some modern farms even let the cows decide for themselves when to get milked; they have automated stalls where they can just walk in and have a snack while the machine does its thing, then walk out. And an increasing number of cattle farms are installing these big rotating car-wash style brushes, which the cows can use to scratch their backs.[“Awww yeah, that’s the spot!” (Picture from Imgur, source uncertain.)]Even separating them from their calves at birth doesn’t really bother them, because a side effect of breeding them for docility is that they lost a lot of their maternal instincts. (I have some internet acquaintances who work in dairy, and they’ve told stories about cows giving birth in the field and just… walking away. Calving season can be awfully stressful for that reason.) They don’t get a chance to form a bond, and the calves get hand-raised by workers anyway. Raising them like this ensures that they get adequate care in a safe environment, because otherwise there’s always the chance that they could be abandoned or accidentally injured by their mothers, or catch some kind of illness from the adults. It also gets them used to being around humans as early as possible, because unlike beef cattle, dairy cows will get a lot of personal interaction with the farmhands.So whatever scary stories you’ve heard about the dairy industry, at least in the US, they’re probably untrue.Edit: Thank you for the upvotes.
