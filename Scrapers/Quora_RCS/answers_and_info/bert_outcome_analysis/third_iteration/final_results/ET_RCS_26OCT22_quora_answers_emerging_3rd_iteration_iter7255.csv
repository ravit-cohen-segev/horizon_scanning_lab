2,"Not that difficult actually...I disagree with the comment that it isn't possible.  This kind of thing happens all the time, in fact, you probably don't have to give up 50% to do it.  Its the way the question is phrased that perhaps what throws folks off.You aren't really planning on owning all of these facilities yourself are you?  How many languages are you ready to learn, customs to become acquainted with, people to hire etc.?  Realistically, you are going to work with local developers and business people to share the opportunity with them.

How many languages are you ready to learn, customs to become acquainted with, people to hire etc.?  Realistically, you are going to work with local developers and business people to share the opportunity with them.  You receive a royalty or licensing fee from each one who helps develop your new technology at each location.  The world is filled with ethical business people who are looking for answers to major problems.  Their issue is to be sure that you are real, and that your technology is sound.  The money is there, far more than you can ever need, it really is up to you to allow them to do what they do best in making the technology solve their problems.To begin with, when you talk about major population centers, Ask comes up with 4,416 cities in the world with a population of over 150,000 or more.   So with your figure of 30B to handle all of these centers you end up with a budget of $6.8M per location.  Now you don't mention what kind of world changing technology you are working with, but lets assume that it is something amazing and you only need one in each city (I doubt this, but there is no more information offered).  So at $6.8M per location, that is a lot more manageble number than $30B...  There are plenty of local resources for debt financing for up to 70% of these funds so the local investors only need to raise about 20-30% of the cost of each system...The issue you face is how to build ONE unit that works...  Do that, prove it works, then let the rest of the world figure out the rest.  My company had to face the same question and the final number will be much larger than $30B and I have no intention of giving up any equity to get there, it simply isn't necessary.In short, don't worry too much about the VC answer.  They are correct, you will never raise anywhere near that number from equity and certainly not from that crowd!  Look further, look to the people you would be helping and you will find your answer...",218 followers,Alan Ham,2.7K,270,758K,2015,https://www.quora.com/Which-technologies-should-C++-developers-know

4,"No we do not.This is a soapbox I find myself often standing upon, on Quora. There is a general poor understanding of what the word technology means. There is a common misconception that if the scientific principles are understood and there is an ability to make the machines, then the technology is there. That is not what technology means. This is where I must use one of my stamps.There really is no such thing as saying we already have the technology to do something new and complicated in space. The complexity of space missions means they all require technology development. Fifty-four years agoNo we do not.This is a soapbox I find myself often standing upon, on Quora.

This is where I must use one of my stamps.There really is no such thing as saying we already have the technology to do something new and complicated in space. The complexity of space missions means they all require technology development. Fifty-four years ago we put humans in low Earth orbit, yet today, companies like SpaceX are developing the technologies needed to do the same. Space is not plug-and-play.Nobody currently has a launch vehicle that can propel a spacecraft large enough to hold humans, all the way to Mars. There are some in development, but the very word development tells us that they are developing the technology.Nobody has a vehicle that can land humans on Mars. Mars has a very thin atmosphere, which means it doesn’t serve as an efficient braking mechanism as Earth’s atmosphere does. If you followed the various Mars Rover programs, you will remember how they had to do all kinds of crazy things to slow down those rovers before they hit the ground - things like airbags and sky-cranes.Nobody has a habitat that can maintain a crew for the time they would be on Mars.Nobody has a vehicle that can lift humans off of the Martian surface. We haven’t lifted a human off of a celestial body - without a massive rocket - since 1972. There is a lot of technology to develop, there.Nobody has a spacecraft that can hold and care for astronauts for more than two years, without regular resupply from Earth.Nobody has protocols to keep astronauts healthy for missions of that duration. This is one of the key purposes of the ISS - to help us develop that technology.To better understand what the word technology means, see these two posts:What is technology?What are Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs)?",0 followers,Wayne Boyd,2.3K,5.1K,13.7M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Which-technologies-should-C++-developers-know
5,"If NASA had been funded like it was in the 1960's, we'd already be there. For just a landing, I think it could probably be done with existing technology, although it wouldn't be the most efficient. While it would be desirable to have a system that recycled everything, simply sending sufficient supplies for the trip would be an option. The main effort would be designing a comprehensive system and making sure all the parts worked together properly.Now if you're talking about going to Mars and staying there, then there is still a lot of work to be done on developing a self-sufficient life supportIf NASA had been funded like it was in the 1960's, we'd already be there.

7,"Getting to Mars isn’t so difficult these days, at least for spacecraft with no human crew. We pretty much have that part down. Every two years the two planets align themselves favorably for an orbital transfer to take place, which is how we get to Mars.Putting humans on Mars is a whole different ball of wax.Radiation in deep space during the 8 month journey is a problem.

I texted him and again called him, he picked the call and I said:Me: what's going on. I came across this FB post. Have you cracked NVIDIA?
