Its discovery resulted in the Nobel Prize for Physics being given “for groundbreaking experiments regarding the two-dimensional material graphene.”Graphene is classified as two-dimensional: it is one atom thick (not pure two-dimensional but as close as we can come) and this form creates several fascinating properties.So why hasn’t this material exploded?

4,"Recent advancements have been in fuel economy, safety, and technology.I think a big thing in the future will be alternative fuels and propulsion methods, though it’s hard to say how long it will take for a really good alternative to become standard.

The batteries in electric cars still rely on electricity being generated someRecent advancements have been in fuel economy, safety, and technology.I think a big thing in the future will be alternative fuels and propulsion methods, though it’s hard to say how long it will take for a really good alternative to become standard. We know fossil fuels are a limited resource and will eventually run out. The batteries in electric cars still rely on electricity being generated somewhere by some means, and they are heavy and very toxic.Maybe the Fusion Jr. (as shown in Back to the Future) will be the new standard…a car that runs on banana peels and other food waste.Hydrogen cells have a lot of promise, but also have a really long way to go. They are test marketing hydrogen cars, I think in the LA area.Bio-Diesel has its fans, but it would take a lot of acres to grow enough corn to make enough corn oil to run all the cars in the world. If we dedicate too much agriculture to fuel production, we may not have enough food.A huge advancement would be efficient public transportation. I’m not expecting that anytime soon, but every futuristic movie that shows an orderly society has efficient community planning...","58,988 followers",Michael Wolfe,504,2K,17.3M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-next-upcoming-big-thing-in-the-automotive-sector-in-regards-to-technology

6,"Transfer learning in ML models.Humans are really good at generalizing. We only have to see a few dogs before we can recognize a dog when we see one.Machines are not. ML models require millions of examples before forming a reliable classifier, and that classifier is very specific to the data on which it was trained. If your training data doesn't include dogs with three legs, the model won't recognize them. A machine that plays Go is useless at checkers.Transfer learning is the ability to apply a model from one domain to a different one.

It's hypothesized that the reason humans learn so quickly is that we are fitting new examples into our existing knowledge rather than forming entirely new categories. If we could teach machines to do the same, they would learn exponentially faster and apply that learning more effectively.Transfer learning is a very hot topic in AI research right now, so I expect major breakthroughs in the next few years. I think this may be sufficient to achieve artificial general intelligence, but even if not, it will dramatically extend the range of tasks that machines can accomplish.","135,532 followers",Hector Quintanilla,582,1.2K,88.6M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-next-upcoming-big-thing-in-the-automotive-sector-in-regards-to-technology

The F-35’s missile remote interface unit and the panoramic cockpit display are only produced by Ayesaş, and Kale Aerospace and the Canadian company Heroux Devtek working jointly are the only producers of the landing gear uplock assembly. Significant number of other parts are also produced solely by Turkish companies: various Turkish aerospace companies produce 45% of Alternate Mission Equipment, 40% of electrical wiring interconnection systems, as well as significant amounts of engine parts, airframe structures, training systems, center fuselages, composite skins and weapon bay doors, and composite air inlet ducts.Turkey isn’t the only F-35 partner that is the sole source for some of the aircraft parts. The production of the F-35 relies on a steady supply of parts from companies all over the globe from a dozen different nations.The USAnd of course, if Turkey’s no longer providing funds, it’s not going to be buying its significant order of over a hundred F-35’s either, and that coupled with the extra costs associated with setting up production of critical parts in the US means that Lockheed-Martin would have to either find another big customer or hike the per-unit cost of the aircraft up by a significant margin to cover for the development costs.Of course, the loss of contracts and businesses for Turkish aerospace companies this would entail would be unpleasant in the extreme as well. It’d be a mutually destructive route to take, which is why, for all the ridiculousness that has been going on in the American-Turkish relations and deliveries of the F-35 parts, we’d appreciate not having to use it.",UNKNOWN,Tomaž Vargazon,3.2K,7.7K,249.8M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-must-the-upcoming-5-technologies-mobile-developers-keep-in-mind
9,"They have no history of even producing non stealthy combat aircraft. Russia has been manufacturing jet aircraft since post WW2. Yet they still cannot produce a comparable combat aircraft that rivals a f22 or f35 (stealthy aircraft). The only thing Turkey produces are some components for the f35. I believe that contract was cancelled when Turkey started to buy the Russian S500 and was forbidden to purchase the F35.Whats important to note is all the subsystems: engine, avionics, sensors, programming, etc. To my knowledge there are no jet engine suppliers in Turkey.

Turkey is run by a despot. He has ruined the economy of the nation. Their currency is worthless. He has ravaged the military due to political instability. There was an attempted coup a few years back…or so they say. Others have commented that it was a staged coup (needing an excuse) to purge the military.You are not showing good judgement when you ask questions like this. You need to learn to discern. My guess is that your young and naive. Don’t worry I was like you when I was young.I was fortunate to work for Lockheed Martin and got to meet scientists and engineers with credentials I could never hope to attain.Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman are leaders in stealth. I don’t think even Boeing can match their competence in this field. Boeing is a firm with twice the revenue of Lockheed Martin.Scrutinize the F32 that Boeing built to compete against the F35 during the development contract. Boeing relied on “Harrier technology.” It was also a very ugly plane (but thats my opininion).The Lockheed Skunkworks was able to develop a VSTOL aircraft with a secondary lift fan to provide 2 shafts of vertical thrust. An immense engineering challenge. Thanks to Paul Bevelaqua….and before that to Denys Overholzer….before that to Ben Rich and before that to Kelly Johnson. Lots of other folks are being left out…..Alan Brown….etc. Its really a cascade of super talent through the ages. These guys worked 12 to 15 hours a day, six days a week to meet deadlines.What a catalyst Kelly Johnson was. His legacy may never be matched again. The best aerospace engineer of the last century. He probably had no idea what the Skunkworks would do after his death in terms of aircraft that became crown jewels and their impact on national security.To go from propeller Electra’s in the 1930’s to passenger Constellations that cruised at 300 mph in the 1950’s and in 15 years to build a recon jet that cruised at 2100 mph at 85,000 feet. Think of Thomas Edison inventing the phonograph and and 15 years later inventing a CD player. These are the kinds of advances the Skunkworks attained. Kelly and his staff had to reinvent the wheel. He really had no limits. “NO” was not in his vocabulary. In his mind he could see what a wind tunnel would prove, what a specific thermodynamic value would be…in an instant without using his slide rule.Turkey….yeah right.",4 followers,Jimmy Savage,620,194,946.4K,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-must-the-upcoming-5-technologies-mobile-developers-keep-in-mind
