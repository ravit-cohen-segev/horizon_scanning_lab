0,"Imagine that you are a productive wealthy person or have agents who are deploying capital on your behalf. Some portion of that money would be set aside for speculative yet seemingly viable technologies. Depending on how much money you have, your reputation and your openness to ideas at some point you will be pitched with an idea for advanced technology. It may not be Wakandan level tech it could just be a better mousetrap. Now logically if you believe that this will be a profitable investment you will keep it secret while in the devolpment phases (including the development of a marketing plan)Imagine that you are a productive wealthy person or have agents who are deploying capital on your behalf.

So the answer is yes the wealthy are working on secret advanced tech but that is also a relative term so I do not expect any announcements that the 85 richest persons are moving to Elysium anytime soon but we could hear about new battery technology or new grave digging machines.",UNKNOWN,Ali O.

1,"It depends on what you mean by secret.Apple’s next devices are all shrouded by secrecy…but we have a pretty good idea of what to expect based on previous devices… are those secret? does Tim Cook count as working on the technologies, even though he is not a technologist?Before Elon Musk announced the roof tile/solar cells it was well known (to those paying attention) that he was working on a Solar cell gigafactory in New York.

3,"I once had a venture capitalist (VC) tell me that I had come up with more legitimate billion-dollar concepts than anyone he'd ever known. I have friends who went from zero to billionaire status. So, I feel qualified to give you a straight answer. My answer will assume you want them to have the know-how, creativity and value systems to pull it off on their own.

The whole purpose of what I've stated above is to equip your children with the tools to spot and build on an opportunity to add value to the world.How will you know you're on the right track? The vast majority of people you meet are inert. One in ten or twelve has scalar energy—they liven up the event. One in a thousand or so has vector energy—the ability to channel effort to a purpose and pull others in their wake. The only way a human being begins to become a vector force is toYou should be getting glimpses of that talent to pursue purpose with passion all along, but it doesn't mature until adult years. It is such a rare thing that schools are not at all equipped to teach it. Even the best MBA programs teach you how to go to work for that guy rather than be that guy.

Slowly, you earn truck loads of money and become a billionaire.You can now stop playing video games, and do what you actually enjoy, oh wait...that's playing video games!Money is usually not the primary motivator to work. It's ego/passion/enjoyment/expectations. Billionaires who continue working, do it because that's what they want to do, and not because it gives them money. Their work is their video games.","1,691 followers",Curt Sutherland,619,2.4K,26.4M,2014,https://www.quora.com/Are-billionaires-and-multimillionaire-working-on-secret-advanced-technologies

7,"Nanotechnology is still in its infancy, but in the coming decades, we may see the rise of people/corporations becoming very wealthy over it. It has a wide variety of applications in industries such as medicine, engineering, military, computing, and energy production. Because of its high potential usefulness, a lot of firms are doing research in this field. If one of those firms gets a breakthrough and manages to patent that breakthrough, they may manage to leverage that breakthrough by selling products/licensing that breakthrough and making a large amount of money through that.

11,"This is a good question, especially as politics is the least of my interests.

But let’s address it anyway as this group is affecting my family and other millions in the UK.Some people think the ERG are some sort of “Sadly, none of the above is trueBut instead all they haveAs such, the behaviour of the ERG is very curious and bears investigating. What is theirWell, one thing they seem to fear is coming under the new EU anti-tax avoidance regulations. While it is a huge incentive to avoid being scrutinised and taxed fairly like everyone else, such a singular aim is not plausible for such a large group of people.Looking behind the scenes, a lot of data suggests that the ERG are part of a clandestine lobbying movement out to manipulate and change the way the UK is run - ordinary people will be trampled over in the rush to adopt brutal US-style economic policies. No wonder the ERG don’t want to pay taxes. Why should they fund the NHS when soon everyone will be buying their own health insurance like in the USA? Why should they fund schools when they can be privatised? Why pay for prisons when they can be sold off to be managed by equity funds? And so on.I don’t make these sort of suggestions lightly. The evidence is a sobering exposé by Richard Hutton of a sordid lobbying movement going back decades, and this harsh economic/social engineering movement is the birthplace of crazed right-wing groups such as Economists for Free Trade, Brexit Central and other crucial parties within the Leave campaign.Therefore, to understand the ERG and Brexit, you have to understand the real agenda behind the referendum - and this agenda is still evident in the bizarre stubborn rhetoric and lack of sense in every announcement from the ERG and Jacob Rees-Mogg. The document exposes the strategy behind the mendacious Brexit campaign, along with the real instigators. And there is so much more.The exposé can be found by clicking on:I think it is every UK citizen’s duty, both Leave or Remain, to read and understandTo put it simply, the following picture asks a good question, and the surprising answer needs to be understood.Thanks for the A2A,","68,794 followers",Kanthaswamy Balasubramaniam,898,17.3K,413.6M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Are-billionaires-and-multimillionaire-working-on-secret-advanced-technologies
