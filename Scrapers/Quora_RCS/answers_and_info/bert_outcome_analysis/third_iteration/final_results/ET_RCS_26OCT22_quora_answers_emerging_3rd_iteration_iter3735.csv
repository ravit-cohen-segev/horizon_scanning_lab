1,"When the US banned some companies from dealing with China they threw in some foreign ones - Taiwan for example.

But when your company provides like 75% of it’s stuff to China it doesn’t really have a choice.

3,"In a few areas, actually. First is infrastructure. The Chinese planned waaaaaaaaaay ahead while building. That’s why there were ghost cities.

The Chinese planned waaaaaaaaaay ahead while building. That’s why there were ghost cities. The developers built huge communities before they were needed, knowing that large factories were coming soon. Above that is public transportation. Smaller cities have buses available that will take you just about everywhere within the city and bigger cities have subways as well as buses. For going between cities and provinces, China has a high speed rail system in place that is more extensive than the American highway system! For example: I lived in a city called Nanjing in China - about 200 miles/300 km from Shanghai. I could take a high speed train from Nanjing to Shanghai in about 1.5 hours!In contrast, I took an Amtrak train from Detroit to Chicago (about 300 miles/480 km) and it took over 8 hours!Another area China wins at is public utilities. They provide electricity, water, and gas for billions of people for very affordable prices! I paid maybe a total of $20 (US) per month for all utility bills, whereas it cost me over $100 in America! Atop of that is wireless technology (which is considered a public utility in China). I paid 100 rmb ($15) monthly for 16 GB of 4G data, with 1000 texts and 500 minutes of ta...",UNKNOWN,Titus,1.1K,453,1.3M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Are-US-and-China-fighting-a-tech-war-over-semiconductors-and-other-advanced-technology

Moreover, because the Trump administration was so universally disliked, that the world ensured that Huawei will not only survived but strived - the German and French leader personally guaranteed in their private meeting with the China’s leader of Huawei’s continued access to European technology AND a lot of China’s purchases will now be made from European companies. BUT the irony is that a lot of American companies will be bankrupted as a result of Trump’s actions as the Chinese purchased most of America’s production. You will likely see a lot of bankruptcies in the American semiconductor industry within the next year or two as the Chinese cut off their purchases from these companies and ensure that their foreign suppliers do so as well.",469 followers,Daniel Cohort,11.9K,377,1.2M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Are-US-and-China-fighting-a-tech-war-over-semiconductors-and-other-advanced-technology
5,"Why should Hauwei ‘share’ its technology with anyone? They have the patents, they own their technology. I’m sure they will happily ‘sell’ their equipment in their boxes to anyone who wants to BUY them. I think that what the Hauwei boss means is that he will happily let other countries read their patent documents and will crush anyone who ‘steals’ their technology.

What it did do was to open their borders to foreign companies on the condition they took on a Chinese partner and shared their IP. The WTO said this was ‘unusual’ but NOT against the rules.4,500+ American companies came over knowing what they had to give in return. No one complained. Over 280,000 companies in total ended up in China all obeying the agreement they had made.“Only the America government complained. No American companies complained and now trumps is trying to force them to ‘come home’ which they are all fighting. Also, not a single other nation has complained as far as I am aware and that because they all understood what they were agreeing too and the fact that there is billions of dollars to be made in China and not that much to be made in the US.Why in Gods name does anyone think they want to go home?","29,925 followers",Tomaž Vargazon,1K,7.7K,249.7M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Are-US-and-China-fighting-a-tech-war-over-semiconductors-and-other-advanced-technology

That is how the US is spanking Huawei very hard, using scarcely believable hegemonic application of ownership rights and privileges. Woe betide globalization if others resort to a liberal reinterpretation of the same in a tit for tat.What the Americans have demonstrated is equally applicable to any Chinese company that raises ire—xiaomi, OPPO, ZTE. Just designate them as national security threats via executive order and presto, congress is bypassed and the American people is off the hook.Why is America targeting Huawei and not a broader industry base? I suggest it is because China is one of America's largest customer for her tech companies.China has mostly parried, but has not retaliated in kind, yet.But this cannot continue. Hundreds of millions of smart phone unit orders disappearing overnight will have component suppliers in a titzy fit from Seoul to Tokyo to Shenzhen to Taipei.","68,776 followers",Kanthaswamy Balasubramaniam,898,17.3K,413.3M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Are-US-and-China-fighting-a-tech-war-over-semiconductors-and-other-advanced-technology

For one thing, the insects digestive processes didn’t stop immediately on the death of the insect, even assuming that the insect was trapped in the sap immediately after having collected it’s sample of blood. For another, DNA itself is unstable, and over a span of thousands of years, not the millions required, would cease to hold useful genetic information. Ignoring that problem for the moment, realize that to re-create a dinosaur, one would need a complete DNA sequence for the dinosaur, and we don’t even know how many chromosomes they had. Once the DNA was obtained, it would have to be implanted in a suitable egg. For the smaller dinosaurs, an Ostrich egg might be big enough, I suppose, but there is no guarantee that the substance of the egg would enable proper development of the dinosaur.In short, the premises of Jurassic Park were something like the old Sidney Harris cartoon:Between the extraction of the (purely hypothetical) blood from the remains of an insect, they went with nothing but a little arm-waving directly to a fully functioning Cretaceous era ecology, with no thought for the possibility that modern plants might have been toxic to the newly recreated animals, or how the animals might have learned to function without parents to provide examples and protection during development….",0 followers,Priyan Bopitiya,4.7K,269,7.2M,2022,https://www.quora.com/Are-US-and-China-fighting-a-tech-war-over-semiconductors-and-other-advanced-technology
