1,"In what technological realm?In some areas, they are replacing other technologies. They are demonstrating that coherent light can achieve results that no other known technologies can realize. Telecommunications is one such area.In other areas, they are a stopgap. We currently do not have a better solution. Initiating nuclear would be one of my first guesses.As far as weapons go, the jury is still out. I do not believe they will ever be a viable solution beyond targeting and for some specific applications.",3 followers,Julien Boyer,660,1.3K,6.2M,2020,https://www.quora.com/How-revolutionary-will-5G-be
2,"OLED or QLEDsThe best TVs right now if money is not an issue, or not a huge concern and you want a great TV are OLEDs and QLEDs.Apple IPhone X was OLED even though more expensive , and the newer XS AND XR are not I assume because burn-in and burn-out became a problem.LG makes OLED panels for LG and Sony and every other companies because they have the patent. OLEDs are made with an organic compound that lights up, goes dark and changes color by themselves. This allows for very dark blacks and the OlEDs can be very thin. LG has a model that is so thin it is recommended it only be installed by anOLED or QLEDsThe best TVs right now if money is not an issue, or not a huge concern and you want a great TV are OLEDs and QLEDs.Apple IPhone X was OLED even though more expensive , and the newer XS AND XR are not I assume because burn-in and burn-out became a problem.LG makes OLED panels for LG and Sony and every other companies because they have the patent. OLEDs are made with an organic compound that lights up, goes dark and changes color by themselves. This allows for very dark blacks and the OlEDs can be very thin. LG has a model that is so thin it is recommended it only be installed by an expert otherwise you can accidentally RIP YOUR TV!The disadvantage of OLEDs is organic things can die or adapt. This is called Burn Out: one pixel shots off or turns a color, hopefully not pink, and stays that way, Burn In is where a very bright image is onscreen to long, for example a channel logo in upper corner or paused sunset, and the pixels adapt and you get a white smear there.Samsung to avoid this, and surely to avoid paying LG for the patent makes QLEDs. Samsung makes a lot of TVs so they get their materials cheaper and do a lot of product testing. The QLED has the brightest pictures, which can be toned down by changing picture mode from Vivid to Cinema, I like Vivid for the computer correction and how it treats light so I leave it on but lower the brightness and color saturation slightly in Advanced Controls. This is very attractive and best for rooms with lots of light. They have computer controls to enhance the blacks which has brought the darks very close to OLEDs without the danger of an expensive TV getting Burn in or Burn out.I think with Sony you pay a premium for the name and the expensive Japanese economy.The best looking TV I have ever scene aesthetically is the Q6 curved. There are many theories behind curved TVs, but the main reason is the slight curvature makes it so at 10–12’ your eye contacts the entirety of the TV in at the same distance so it’s all in focus. Some people think it makes things look 3D.Unfortunately, Samsung is the only manufacturer who still makes curved TVs and they don’t make a full-array version.The Q8 is full array, what this means is behind the panel of pixels producing colors is another panel of LEDs that does an under painting of light, or mimics the lights and darks of the picture by turning on or off LEDs, so your brights are brighter and darks are darker.It’s a whole different viewing experience. If you’ve seen Avatar you know the aliens have blue skin and wear leather outfits. On a QLED, they are actually blue with faint darker blue stripes, inside arms are lighter blue with little white energy points. Thanks in Avengers has fake pores in his nose.Unfortunately you see too much sometimes, Harrison’s fords complection looks like someone is trying to flatten out tree bark with caked on make up.The Samsung also has voice controls with their own Bixby, that works great. It’s the first voice controls I’ve had that actually works, so much better than my 2016 Ford Fusion which has voice controls but unfortunately doesn’t understand anything I say and is very complicated.",UNKNOWN,Croma - A Tata Enterprise,1.4K,136,15.3M,2019,https://www.quora.com/How-revolutionary-will-5G-be
3,"Transfer learning in ML models.Humans are really good at generalizing. We only have to see a few dogs before we can recognize a dog when we see one.Machines are not. ML models require millions of examples before forming a reliable classifier, and that classifier is very specific to the data on which it was trained. If your training data doesn't include dogs with three legs, the model won't recognize them. A machine that plays Go is useless at checkers.Transfer learning is the ability to apply a model from one domain to a different one.

A machine that plays Go is useless at checkers.Transfer learning is the ability to apply a model from one domain to a different one. It's hypothesized that the reason humans learn so quickly is that we are fitting new examples into our existing knowledge rather than forming entirely new categories. If we could teach machines to do the same, they would learn exponentially faster and apply that learning more effectively.Transfer learning is a very hot topic in AI research right now, so I expect major breakthroughs in the next few years. I think this may be sufficient to achieve artificial general intelligence, but even if not, it will dramatically extend the range of tasks that machines can accomplish.",UNKNOWN,Anonymous,2.8K,0,0,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-will-be-the-next-technology-to-replace-lasers
