I know several research scientists working in the field of longevity (and am dating one), and there’s some really interesting work being done with FOXO4, neuron regeneration, telomere repair, and other approaches to radical longevity.I’m 51, and likely will not live long enough to see these technologies available to people.

The nitrogen in it is laundered through the gut of a cow so that people with chemophobia feel better about it, but make no mistake, that nitrogen got there, at least in part, from chemical synthesis.We are as dependent on technology as the sailors in a nuclear submarine.

7,"SpaceX is a private company and so do not have to post profits. However Gwynne Shotwell has said that they have been profitable for years, which puts them well ahead of Tesla, which as only been occasionally profitable.

8,"Which will be larger in the next 10 years, Tesla or SpaceX, and why?Hmm, tricky considering the variables. Tesla is expanding at the rate of 100% every 18 months, which is exponential growth and will make them the biggest producers of vehicles before the end of the decade ( ignoring their energy side of the equation which is getting bigger as well ).

It has fundamentally changed the auto industry, such that big OEMs are investing hundreds of billions into EVs. And frankly, I am shocked at how far behind they are. Even 9 years after I worked on the Model S, the big boys are nowhere close to it.SpaceX is still far away from its goal of multi-planetary human life.

So the manufacturers are doing their best to improve. Its like computers and automobiles and everything else that has a newer, better model out every year. Why do THEY bother? Why aren’t we still driving 1990 cars and watching big huge TVs?As for production costs. That’s the biggest factor. Many people compare hearing aids to iPhones. But Apple has produced over 2 BILLION iPhones in 10 years. ALL of the major hearing aid manufacturers combined have not made but a tiny fraction of the number of units of hearing aids. And then you have to divide that between the 6 major manufacturers (2 are merging). If you are spending 20 million per year on R&D and then you only sell a few hundred thousand units in an entire product LINE, the math doesn’t add up.It is a case of what comes first, the chicken or the egg? In the USA there are 40 million people, give or take, who need hearing aids. Many are in denial. Only 10% of those actually get them… maybe. So how do the manufacturers ramp up production to get costs down, if the consumers aren’t buying? And how do the consumers buy if the production costs are still too high?On top of that, most medical doctors in the USA don’t proactively recommend hearing aids to their patients. Its been a while but a few years ago I saw a study that showed that only 7% of MDs in the USA recommend hearing aids. This is ridiculous. Doctors need to get off their booties and start taking care of their whole patient.Patients also bear some of the blame. For some reason, people understand that their physical joints take years to deteriorate before they have knee replacement or hip replacement surgery; and that it will take months of physical rehab to start walking normally again because your body has to relearn how to move properly. But people lose their hearing over decades and somehow think they can buy a hearing aid and it will perfectly correct their hearing overnight. Research shows that on average, it takes 4 months of full time wearing a correctly programmed hearing aid before the wearer’s brain starts getting the full benefit of corrected hearing. Many people simply don’t persist long enough, and they stop wearing their devices.Hearing technology is great and works wonderfully. Prices will vary depending on the provider and what kind of service and followup you want. But prices aren’t likely to drop much until more people start adopting the technology.I know people don’t like this idea, and it goes against my conservative nature, but it would be a benefit to everyone if people over the age of 50 had to get hearing tests and verify that they have good hearing in order to drive. If you can’t hear an ambulance coming up behind you, that’s a safety concern, right? And if you have hearing loss, you have to wear your hearing aids to drive. Suddenly, you would be surprised to see just how quickly people can come up with the cash for hearing aids. Afterall, retirees have more money than any group of people in the USA.","68,794 followers",Kanthaswamy Balasubramaniam,898,17.3K,413.6M,2019,https://www.quora.com/How-old-are-people-in-their-20s-today-going-to-be-able-to-be-due-to-advancing-technology

12,"It would depend what you mean by ‘improved’, as every user has different issues with hearing aids.In terms of aesthetics, some would say an improvement would be making hearing aids smaller, particularly powerful HAs designed for profound losses. However, some users, such as those with sight loss or issues with dexterity, would not want a smaller aid.Some people would want an invisible hearing aid (matches skin/ hair color or hides in the ear canal) while others want their aids as brightly coloured and obvious as they can make them.In terms of technology, there are several issues that come to mIt would depend what you mean by ‘improved’, as every user has different issues with hearing aids.In terms of aesthetics, some would say an improvement would be making hearing aids smaller, particularly powerful HAs designed for profound losses. However, some users, such as those with sight loss or issues with dexterity, would not want a smaller aid.Some people would want an invisible hearing aid (matches skin/ hair color or hides in the ear canal) while others want their aids as brightly coloured and obvious as they can make them.In terms of technology, there are several issues that come to mind, both from my own experience and having discussed with other hearing aid users.Most hearing aids are great at amplifying sound, but are not great at amplifying the sounds you necessarily want to hear. A typical example is a noisy restaurant: there will be other tables, staff, possibly music, cutlery and glasses clinking… and the people you want to talk to! Hearing aids will amplify EVERY sound, rendering the environment a noisy misery, forcing you to lip-read your friends, or sometimes rip your hearing aids out in frustration and endure the rest of your meal in silence.A lot of hearing aids aren’t great at connecting to other medias without extra (expensive) devices. Phonak, for example, offers an enormous range of assistive listening technology such as clip on microphones, table microphones, multimedia hubs, etc. These devices all require add-ons to your hearing aid, as well as ‘receivers’, bringing your total cost to an eye-watering sum potentially in the thousands of pounds. While a very few aids offer bluetooth, most do not, thus limiting the ability to listen to music or talk on the phone.Some hearing aids are offering rechargeable technology, but usually on select models. In the meantime, one has to carry spare batteries everywhere you go (specialist ones at that, very few corner shops carry size 675 batteries, and if they do, they’re super expensive!). The one time you forget to bring your spares will be when you have an important meeting and BOTH your ‘ears’ choose that moment to run out of battery and leave you in silence.Hearing aids are also very delicate. Unlike glasses, which can survive a swim or a fall, hearing aids are not waterproof (at best they are ‘water resistant’) and are very unhappy if you drop or hit them. I tripped and had my hearing aid fall out a few inches onto the ground, and it lost half its sound, meaning I had to get it replaced and spend several weeks with mono-directional audio. A friend of mine got hit in the side of their head by a football, and not only had a broken hearing aid, but a nasty injury to the side of their head where the aid had snapped and cut their skin.As a final point, hearing aids are aWearing a hearing aid is a personal decision based on many factors, of which the available technology is a tiny part, and even if you improved all the issues I highlighted above, there would not be a “huge increase in hearing aid sales” as the market size will not change. Even if all hearing aids were free, there would not be much more of an uptake, as the user group would not suddenly expand.Hearing aids are not like the latest i-device or tablet, where new advances mean many more customers will buy it. Hearing aids are highly specialised medical instruments, personalised to fit the user. While my own hearing aids are not perfect, they’re much better than my (remaining) hearing alone.","5,990 followers",Jens Böttiger,566,2.6K,17.6M,2019,https://www.quora.com/How-old-are-people-in-their-20s-today-going-to-be-able-to-be-due-to-advancing-technology
