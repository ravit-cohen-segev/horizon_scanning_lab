F-22 is the ONLY operational fighter which can cruiser (sustain flying) at speed considerably higher speed than mach 1. (Rafale, EF Typhoon, Gripen and new versions of F-15 and F-16 can also fly slightly higher than mach 1 speed without afterburner, but only with very small weapons and fuel load).So, most military planes practically NEVER fly at speeds even close to their maximum speed. However, to be able to fly at those speeds, the frame or the aircraft has to be made to survive the heat from the drag at those high speeds, and the intakes of the engines have to be designed to be able to digest air at those high speeds.By limiting the maximum speed of F-18 to mach 1.8, the intakes could be made both lighter and stealthier, also and the frame of the plane could be made lighter.Also, because F-18 is designed to be operated from aircraft carriers, it needs a good low-speed flight abilities to be able to safely land on aircraft carriers. These good low-speed abilities mean relatively long wings with low sweep angle. This kind of wings make it agile and efficient at low speeds, but give it higher drag at supersonic speeds than shorter wings, wings with higher wings sweep angle or delta wings. So, because F-18 was designed to be very well-suited to carrier operation, its drag at supersonic speeds is greater. F-14 solves this by using variable-swept wings, but variable-swept wings are very heavy (making F-14 have much worse thrust-to-weight ratio than F-18 making it slower to accelerate and slower to climb), expensive and maintenance-intensive.","6,091 followers",David Tussey,506,1.8K,37.5M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Do-private-intelligence-agencies-exist-And-if-not-why
11,"For the same reason that the Navy let go of its dedicated carrier-based tankers, the post-Cold War and War on Terror mission sets did not require much in the way of very long range strikes. It is only the increased risk from long range anti-ship missiles that has lead to an assumption that a large part of the mission set will include very long range strikes. So conformal fuel tanks for the F/A-18E/F, as well as the MQ-25 tankers, are being brought into the fleet.","6,091 followers",David Tussey,651,1.8K,37.5M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Do-private-intelligence-agencies-exist-And-if-not-why

For the F/A-18E (single seat version) Super Hornet that comes out to 0.9. That’s not the eye watering number of some of the more current fighters, but it’s damn impressive.The challenge with almost all Naval aircraft is 1) they have to be heavier and stronger than their land-base counterparts to tolerate the catapult launches and arrested landings, and 2) they have to have sufficient fuel to tolerate carrier cyclic operations, which is usually 1:45 - realistically close to 2 hrs.So any Navy aircraft must have sufficient fuel (endurance) to fly its mission and stay aloft for ~2 hrs. AND you have to throw in the need to manage your fuel such that you can remain comfortably above “Bingo” fuel (the fuel state which forces a diversion to a land-based field) but low enough to bring back any unexpended ordnance including fuel tanks, internal ammo, self-defense missiles, targeting pods, bomb racks, etc. It’s quite a balancing act on every single hop.Why do I mention this? Because there’s a world of difference between how an aircraft might perform under ideal conditions, or if land based, and how you have to configure an aircraft to perform off a carrier. The result of the above considerations is that most F/A-18s, including the Super Hornet, need to fly with 2 (or 3!) external fuel tanks (or take on external fuel from a tanker), and that results in a lot of extra drag to an otherwise high performance aircraft. And the EA-18 Growler is even worse, of course, with the need to permanently carry those external jamming pods.Trust me, I weep when I see the extra fuel tanks and tons of ordnance and targeting pods hanging on an F/A-18, F-16, or F-15. I weep because I know the penalty that places on performance. True, in a life or death situation the pilot could jettison all those external stores and thus increase their maneuverability, but that’s not much comfort for routine flight ops.And that often results in comments that the Super Hornet is underpowered. It’s not, but carrier ops necessitate extra external stores that certainly degrade performance.And that is one reason that the Super Hornet Block III is receiving conformal fuel tanks (CFT) similar to those on the F-16. They extend the endurance/range with a much smaller penalty on performance. I should note that at one time there was discussion of an engine enhancement (+10–15% thrust) as part of the Block III, but that was never approved. I think most Rhino pilots would argue that the Super Hornet would greatly benefit from one.","6,091 followers",David Tussey,509,1.8K,37.5M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Do-private-intelligence-agencies-exist-And-if-not-why

The F-18E is one of the few 4th gen. capable of using its AESA radar for EW operationsThat being said, Meteor’s ramjet is a major advantage in air combat and will give Rafale considerable advantage until AIM-260 JATM becomes operational.In air-ground, Rafale is mostly limited to French weapons which are expensive and not as versatile. For instance, HARMs give F-18E far better ability to target enemy radars.The AGM-88E HARMs, JSOW, GBU-53 Storm Breaker and LRASM along with ability to carry decoys like MALD-J give F-18E much better strike capability overall, especially in SEAD role.There’s not a large difference in their overall performance. The F-18 Super Hornet’s major advantage is that it provides similar performance at much lower cost.With Meteor Rafale is more potent in air combat until 2022 while Super Hornet is a better multirole platform. With AIM-260 it’ll be a different game where Super Hornet can fully utilise its superior radar.","1,230 followers",Kris Schies,828,1.5K,14.8M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Do-private-intelligence-agencies-exist-And-if-not-why
14,How long can an F-18 stay in the air?Due to in flight refueling a F-18 hornet can stay in the air for a period of time equal to pilot endurance.For standard day to day operations that means 6 to 8 hours in the tight confines of a tactical aircraft cockpit. but extreme situations may mean longer periods.

15,"Well, partly, I think you’ve hit on the answer in your question. Two engines could burn fuel faster than one engine. Though this doesn’t answer the entire question so let us look at fuel loads real quick to see if the F-16V does indeed have a longer range (at least potentially).So the F-16V carries about 7,000 pounds of fuel internally and then 3,000 pounds in the CFT’s mounted above the wing roots. So 10,000 pounds of fuel for one engine. The F110-GE-129 engine has a specific fuel consumption at “dry” thrust of 0.64 pounds of fuel per pound of thrust per hour (lb/lbf/h).

So 10,000 pounds of fuel for one engine. The F110-GE-129 engine has a specific fuel consumption at “dry” thrust of 0.64 pounds of fuel per pound of thrust per hour (lb/lbf/h). Meaning if you’re cruising in an F-16V at maximum dry thrust the engine will burn through all 10,000 pounds of fuel in about 55 minutes. That’s just the hypothetical run time for the engine ignoring any other factors. It’s about 38 minutes if you don’t put the CFT’s on the F-16V.Now then, to the F/A-18E Super HornetIt carries 14,700 pounds of fuel in the single seat version (about 1,000 pounds less in the two-seat F variant). The F414-GE-400 engines each, at dry thrust, produce 13,000 pounds of thrust with an SFC of 0.724. Combined this is 26,000 pounds of thrust and SFC of 1.448. So if you’re cruising along at full “dry” thrust then the two engines combined would burn through all 14,700 pounds of fuel in about 24 minutes. Again, just roughly the run time.So hypothetically the F-16V, without carrying drop tanks under the wing, could fly out further than an F/A-18E/F. However this ignores drag (any external stores on either plane), whether it’s a Hi-Hi-Hi or Hi-Lo-Hi (or other combination) flight profile, etc. There are a lot of factors that go into this and its possible that the F-16V would need to carry even more fuel with an external bomb load to match ranges that the F/A-18E/F could do with its external tanks and an equal or bigger bomb load. A lot of factors here so I think it’s somewhat inconclusive in actual testing.",1 follower,Brian Trott,553,407,13.9M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Do-private-intelligence-agencies-exist-And-if-not-why
