Thus the oxygen stays inside the gunpowder.Moon Escape Velocity: 2.38 km/sGun with fastest Muzzle Velocity: .220 Swift Rifle at 1.422 km/sVerdict: Bullet doesn’t succcesfully leave the Moon and after a really big and long arc just eventually falls back on it.What about a special gun then? Say, a railgun!Those can reach much higher escape velocities. And don’t need oxygen combustion.He’d completelly still miss the Earth, of course. The shooteer needs to do complex computations to calculate his ballistic trajectory juuuuuust riiiiigght, accounting for his loccation on the Moon and the Moon’s gravity and even the Earth’s and Moon’s relative movement speeds in space, so that the bullet can reach the Earth.This is akin to shooting an iron bullet at a fast moving car far away while standing right next to a super magnet: not only the magnet will make the bullet’s trajectory curve a lot, but even without that big magnet there, by the time the bullet would reach where the car was, that car has already moved and is no longer there anyway. So yeah: trick shot!Even then, a bullet is too small to reach the ground, it would just kind of melt away upon reentry or just explode in the atmosphere. Even if it reaches the ground (say it is made of a special very impact resistant and super high heat resistant ceramic compound, so that only bits of it evaporate away), the bullet will be so hardly slowed down by the reentry it would quickly start tumbling down, i.e. merelly falling down, instead of still being traveling at supersonic shooting speeds. Reentry actually has to be made at as SUPER precise angle in order to avoid that kind of atmospheric “tumbling”. Even if you make the bullet rotate as fast as you can (to give it more inertia), a bullet is simply not massive enough to remain aligned perfectly all the way to the ground.Now, a ballitics computer assisted rail gun cannon, on the other hand, could easily hit a (big) target on the Earth while keeping its supersonic speeds.But a mere gun? Even a big one to be held with both hands by a strong Arnold Schwarzy?Nope.In fact all those Yankee Lunarians kinda are presently in the habit of shooting their lunarian guns at us all the time (mainly because every saturday they just love to attend these huge “mooncows” rodeo parties), and yet we never even had so much as a single bullet hit anything anywhere over here! ;-)EDIT: Several commenters corrected that the solid propeller powrder already contains enough oxygen anyway so I’m wrong on that point and they’re completely right.

8,"What will happen if an astronaut fires a gun from the Moon aiming at Earth?Let’s work out what would actually be required to fire a bullet from the Moon to reach the Earth.What the bullet needs to do is reach the point between the Moon and the Earth where their gravitational pull cancels out. After this the Earth’s gravity will dominate and pull the bullet the rest of the way. Put another way, the bullet has to reach the point of maximum gravitational potential between the two.

After this the Earth’s gravity will dominate and pull the bullet the rest of the way. Put another way, the bullet has to reach the point of maximum gravitational potential between the two. Here’s how the potential varies with distance from the centre of the Moon on the direct path from Moon to Earth:The red dashed lines mark the potential at the Moon’s surface and that at the maximum point. All the bullet needs to do to escape the Moon and start being pulled in towards Earth is have enough energy to bridge this gap, which is around 2.6 MJ/kg. To have this amount of kinetic energy the bullet has to be fired at an initial velocity of around 2270 m/s towards Earth.But there’s a further complication. The Moon is of course in orbit around the Earth, with an orbital velocity of around 1020 m/s. The bullet is therefore also travelling at this velocity before firing, and so simply firing towards Earth will just result in a total velocity heading somewhere between Earth and the orbital direction of the Moon.Therefore in order for the resulting velocity of the bullet to be directly towards Earth, it will have to be fired diagonally between the Earth and where the Moon has come from, at a speed sufficient to also cancel the orbital velocity:Earth is at the origin on the left here, to scale, and the Moon is too small to see at the base of the blue orbital velocity arrow.So the firing speed needed is around 2480 m/s, at an angle of around 28˚ back towards where the Moon has come from.In fact although both the principals above apply, it’s a little more complex due to the Moon’s orbit around the Earth. Firstly this orbit moves the point of maximum potential around with it, so that a straight path to Earth would involve reaching a higher point of potential on the way. But the orbiting Moon also pulls the bullet off track, and so this needs to be compensated for with a greater firing angle.The bullet ends up with a curved trajectory like this example, again with the Earth on the left and the Moon orbiting anticlockwise from the right:The firing speed in this example is 2510 m/s at an angle of 54˚ off centre. Of course to achieve this speed would require a gun that’s a lot more powerful than any normal gun.The bullet initially heads away from the direction of the Moon’s orbit, quickly being pulled back by the Moon but not before it has crossed the potential peak on the path that it’s following. From here on it’s caught by the Earth’s gravity, finally striking the Earth on the side away from the Moon after a total travel time of around 4.5 days. The trajectory is similar to that of the returning Apollo space missions.And just like the Apollo missions, whether the bullet finally makes it to the Earth’s surface depends on it surviving the trip through the atmosphere, as by this time the Earth has accelerated the bullet to a speed of over 11 km/s.",6 followers,Mats Andersson,1.2K,20K,370.3M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-will-happen-if-an-astronaut-fires-a-gun-from-the-Moon-aiming-at-Earth

Whether or not it falls back to the moon, enters orbit, or eventually enters Earth’s atmosphere depends on muzzle velocity and angle.Lunar escape velocity is 7800 ft/sec (2380 m/sec) and orbital velocity is just over 1 km/sec. That’s faster than any bullet by a wide margin. .220 swift is the fastest production cartridge and it’s muzzle velocity is only 60% of what’s needed to escape the moon’s gravity (4665 ft/sec or 1422 m/sec) but is enough to put it in permanent orbit if fired at the right angle.

It is uncertain that it can be scaled up to sizes needed for it to be powerful (millions of qubits), there may be very hard fundamental physical limits that cannot be broken. It is also unclear if there are (many) good and useful algorithms for such hardware (we don’t have more than a handful for now).Quantum computing is not a new form of ‘generic computing’, if we get it to work, it will probably be useful for a small class of problems only.The still short (in my opinion, given the subject) answerQuantum computers as they are envisioned now are a very special kind of digital computer. Instead of each bit begin either 0The intuitive butBeing in two states at once provides interesting possibilities for parallelism. Suppose you want to guess a 8-bit number, say an encryption key, that is a value of between 0 and 255. In a 8-bit digital computer, you have to try them all one by one. So, you start with the number 0 (8 zero-bits, or 00000000), then if that fails with the number 1 (7 zero bits and one one bit, or 00000001) etc. If the number you have to guess is 255 you have to do your operation 256 times, on average you have to do it 128 times.Now, suppose the number to guess (e.g. an encryption key, or the best route of a possible 256 routes for a delivery car to deliver all its packets) is 153, or “10011001” in binary. In a digital 8-bit computer you have to make 154 tries. But if your computer is a quantum computer, you start with one 8-qubit ‘superposition’, or “{0 or 1}{0 or 1}{0 or 1}{0 or 1}{0 or 1}{0 or 1}{0 or 1}{0 or 1}” and in one step, the computer finds the answer {0 orBut the story is wrong. There are several huge flies in the ointment. Here is one such a fly (more in the linked article):A true part of the ‘wrong story’ is this: while a 64-bit number in a digital computer can have 2 to the power of 64, or 18,446,744,073,709,551,616 different values, it can only have one such a value at any time. A 64-qubit computer can —So, the 64-qubit computer is extremely efficient while it is operating on all the values in parallel. But then comes reading the calculation result, what in a QM computing is the measurement of the state of those qubits. And then we run into quantum mechanics’ fundamental property: the measurement result isHere is why: suppose we have a qubit that can be in a mixed state of UP and DOWN. Each state can be thought of as a wave. The amplitudes of these waves, when squared, give the probability of that state. And these probabilities (the amplitudes squared) add up to 100%. At all times, a qubit has a probability for each of its two possible states, all chances together adding up to 1 (or 100%).

The task of designing a quantum algorithm is to design the interference such that only the right solution is allowed.The property of interference that makes it powerful is that it uses the wave nature of quantum theory. That means that a small local change of one qubit can affect the entire output. That's the parallel part, except that it's not really parallel. It's nonlocal.Here's an example of how nonlocality can work to solve a very simple problem that you can't solve classically. There are two paths; the low road and the high road. They both lead to the same place, which is a house with two doors; a red door and a blue door. Behind one of the doors is a lot of money. Only one of the two roads has a coloured ticket that will tell you which door to open. So you have two choices: Take the high road or take the low road. Open the red door or open the blue door. Based on this information, you can work out the probability of opening the door with the money, but it's not one… but if you were a quantum particle it could be exactly one. That’s because a quantum particle can take both roads (that’s nonlocality) and interference will ensure that it opens the correct door every time.What you do want is a definite answer, so the output needs to be in a definite state. That's where quantum interference is so important. If the interference is just right, a quantum state can have a definite measurement value. That means the qubit will read like an ordinary bit after all the quantum computing is done. Like in the red door/blue door example, the computing has been done by the time the door opening decision needs to be made.Now take the two door problem and make it a one hundred door problem, with one hundred possible paths and only one ticket, the quantum interference effect will always give you the correct door and it won’t take any extra time to give the solution, even though you’ve increased the complexity by a significant factor.This is where you can see the significant speed up potential. In order to solve the problem classically, you’d need to travel down both paths in some cases, which increases the time. For one hundred paths, you’d need to take many of them on average to solve the problem. However, the quantum particle sees no difference between those two variants of the path problem and would take the same time to solve both.",18 followers,Asim Qureshi,2.9K,996,156.1M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-will-happen-if-an-astronaut-fires-a-gun-from-the-Moon-aiming-at-Earth

Although classical computers help us do many extraordinary things, ""under the hood"" is really just a calculator that uses bit sequences - values ​​0 and 1 to represent two countries (think on and off switches) to understand and decide about our data input after a set of pre-set instructions. Quantum computers are not intended to replace classical computers, they are expected to be different tools that we will use to solve complex problems that are beyond the capabilities of classical computers.Basically, when we enter the world of big data where the information we need to store grows, there is a need for more zeros and transistors to process it. For most classical computers it is limited to doing one thing at a time, so the more complex the problem, the longer it takes. Problems that require more power and time than computers can accommodate today are called problems that cannot be resolved. This is a problem that is predicted to be solved by quantum computers.Quantum Computer StrengthWhen you enter the world of atomic and subatomic particles, everything starts to behave in unexpected ways. In fact, these particles can exist in more than one state at a time. This ability is used by quantum computers.Instead of bits, which are used by conventional computers, quantum computers use quantum bits - known as qubits. To illustrate the difference, imagine a ball. A little can be in one of the two poles of a ball, but a qubit can be at any point on the ball. So, this means that computers that use qubits can store large amounts of information and use less energy to do so than classical computers. By entering this field of quantum computing where the laws of traditional physics no longer apply, we will be able to make processors that are significantly faster (one million or more times) than we use today. Sounds fantastic, but the challenge is quantum computing is also very complex.Pressure is on the computer industry to find ways to make computing more efficient, because we reach the limits of energy efficiency using the classical method. In 2040, according to a report by the Semiconductor Industry Association, we will no longer have the ability to power all engines worldwide. That's why the computer industry competes to make quantum computers work on a commercial scale. Not a small achievement, but one who will pay extraordinary dividends.How our world will change with quantum computingIt is difficult to predict how quantum computing will change our world simply because there will be applications in all industries. We roam into a completely new field of physics and there will be solutions and uses that we have never thought of. But when you consider how many classical computers revolutionize our world by using relatively simple bits and two choices 0 or 1, you can imagine the extraordinary possibility when you have qubit processing power that can do millions of calculations at the same time.What we know is that it will change the game for each industry and will have a big impact on how we do business, find new drugs and materials, protect our data, explore space, and predict","9,064 followers",Allan Steinhardt,655,2.3K,5.2M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-will-happen-if-an-astronaut-fires-a-gun-from-the-Moon-aiming-at-Earth

He was the back up pilot for Apollo 8 which meant normally he would have flown on Apollo 9, however he had a back injury, which meant he was deferred to Apollo 11.

His doctoral thesis was on Line-of-Sight Guidance Techniques for Manned Orbital Rendezvous, so he had an unparalleled understanding of space flight and the LEM systems on top of his Gemini 12 flight experience. This knowledge was tested to the limit during the Apollo 11 landing, where he was able to make several calls including spotting that checking the altitude was initiating some of the 1202 alarms. Throughout the landing he can be heard reading out vital data to Armstrong even though at one point the computer display went completely blank.Image: Aldrin descends from the LEM to the moon…Armstrong however was the best choice for commander because he had demonstrated on two previous occasions that in unpredictable situations he would make the right call. In Gemini 8 he had saved the spacecraft, when a thruster jammed and put the craft into a fast spin, seconds from unconsciousness he was able to regain control. This incident meant that the mission was cut short from its initial planned 3 day length.

Cooper was not all that highly regarded and never got an Apollo mission; Schirra commanded Apollo 7 and quit NASA afterwards.Neil Armstrong was possibly the best test pilot NASA had and that’s saying something. He’d already proven his calmness under fire many times in his career, as a Korean War combat pilot in the Navy, as a test pilot, as commander of the near-disaster Gemini 8 mission where he saved the day with a virtual last-gasp maneuver.The Apollo 11 mission had first been offered to the Apollo 8 crew of Borman, Lovell and Anders, the first men to orbit the moon. However, without even consulting with the others, Borman turned it down. When Armstrong was offered the command spot he was also told that Buzz Aldrin would either be the command pilot or the lunar pilot. Armstrong was then offered his choice of two other men, Mike Collins as command pilot or Fred Haise as lunar pilot. Either choice, Aldrin was going most certainly because he was the only PhD holder among the astronauts and their resident expert on orbital maneuvers. If something went wrong with the orbital rendezvous, NASA wanted their top expert on the scene. I believe the biggest reason Armstrong chose Collins over Haise was that Collins was also a trained test pilot whereas Aldrin, who was a Korean War ace, was not. If the Eagle got into trouble, they’d need Columbia to attempt a rescue and no doubt Armstrong wanted the strongest pilot available as Command Pilot if that happened. That meant Collins. So, Aldrin got to be the 2nd man on the Moon and the odd-man-out Haise was lunar pilot for the ill-fated Apollo 13 mission.I don’t know if it had any role in the decision but temperamentally, Armstrong was the perfect choice for being first man on the moon. He was a very private person, uncontroversial, very taciturn. Aldrin on the other hand was already well into an alcoholism problem before the moon mission (he stopped drinking a few weeks before the flight). His own mother, mentally unstable, killed herself after learning Buzz would be on the moon landing. Aldrin was in and out of rehab and mental hospitals after his return from the moon and I doubt he would’ve shouldered the acclaim and fame of being the first moonwalker as easily as Armstrong. Most likely, he would’ve killed himself or drank himself to death at some point. Instead, he got serious about rehab and is in his 90s, the only surviving member of the Apollo 11 crew.

29,"Because he wasn't. Pete Conrad was initially chosen as the future commander of Apollo 11 when he was originally picked as backup commander of Apollo 8.But let's make things simpler first: there were two main reasons: precedence and coincidence.All the Apollo comanders in the initial missions had previous command experience. Armstrong had already commanded one mission (Gemini VIII) while Aldrin and Collins hadn't. He had precedence. He outranked Aldrin and Collins. It was only with Apollo 15 that an astronaut without previous command experience commanded a mission.The other reason - coincidenceBecause he wasn't.

Armstrong had already commanded one mission (Gemini VIII) while Aldrin and Collins hadn't. He had precedence. He outranked Aldrin and Collins. It was only with Apollo 15 that an astronaut without previous command experience commanded a mission.The other reason - coincidence - is a bit more complex.Back in those days, Deke Slayton was the chief of the astronauts and the guy who picked each astronaut for each mission. He implemented a rotation system for Gemini and Apollo in which the backup commander in one mission would be the prime commander three missions later. Slayton had full confidence in all of his veteran astronauts, especially the ones that had already commanded at least one mission. He believed that any of those veteran astronauts could be the first man on the moon. Absolutely anyone of them.This rotation system meant that whoever was chosen as backup commander of Apollo 8 was poised to become the prime commander of Apollo 11.And the person chosen for backup commander of Apollo 8 was Pete Conrad. Neil Armstrong was chosen as backup commander of Apollo 9, which would place him as prime commander of Apollo 12, not 11.Now one thing happened in August 1968 that changed everything. Grumman, the builder of the Lunar Module, anounced they wouldn't be able to deliver a LM that year. It would have to wait until 1969. That meant NASA would have to postpone the Apollo 8 mission so it could fly with a LM. But NASA didn't want to do that. Instead, they decided Apollo 8 would fly all the way to the moon without a LM.The problem was, the crew for the Apollo 8 mission was already well ahead in training with the LM, while the crew for the Apollo 9 hadn't trained as much. Sending the crew of Apollo 8 without a LM would be a huge waste of training. So what NASA did? They swapped the crews. The original crew for Apollo 9 would fly on Apollo 8 and vice-versa.Here’s where everything changed: when the Apollo 8 and 9 prime crews swapped places, so did their backup crews. That means Pete Conrad, who was backup commander of Apollo 8, wouldn't be prime commander of Apollo 11 anymore. Instead he would command Apollo 12. And Neil Armstrong, backup commander of Apollo 9, wouldn't command Apollo 12. He would command Apollo 11.And all that happened after Deke Slayton, the guy who picked each astronaut for each mission, realized none of the people he actually wanted to be the first man on the moon was available.He wanted Gus Grissom, but Grissom died. Then Slayton went after Frank Borman, but Borman said there wasn't enough time to train to command Apollo 8 and then immediately move to Apollo 11, which was much more complex. Then Slayton asked Jim McDivitt, but he also said he couldn’t train for Apollo 9 and 11 in a row. Finally Slayton decided to just let the rotation system work, which would initially place Pete Conrad in the command of Apollo 11.But when Grumman anounced the LM wouldn't be ready and NASA decided to swap the Apollo 8 and 9 crews, the future commander of Apollo 12 became the future commander of Apollo 11.And that guy was Neil Armstrong.In other words, Armstrong wasn't chosen to be the first man on the moon. It was pure coincidence that placed him in that position.If it was just for time in space, Frank Borman and Jim Lovell had logged many more hours. Both had already commanded missions too. But in the end the rotation system and LM delays defined everything.

See was initially assigned as Armstrong’s junior on 8, so Armstrong, Borman and McDivitt were likely considered the steadiest of the lot. The failure and premature abort of Gemini 8 was no mark against Armstrong. Though he (and his pilot, Dave Scott) acted commendably during the emergency, they were test pilots and this was expected of them. Regardless of the outcome, Armstrong had commanded a mission and was indisputably senior to the ’63 astronauts.Collins was one of the stars of the ’63 class - the first to receive a crew assignment, as backup to Jim Lovell on Gemini 7, which put him in line to be pilot on Gemini 10. The mission was typical of the standard plan for the last five Gemini missions (3 days in space, dock with Agena, boost to higher orbit, spacewalk). It was the first to achieve all these milestones in one (6 had been forced to rendezvous with 7 rather than dock, 8 had aborted immediately after docking, 9 was unable to dock with a non-Agena target that lacked an engine anyway).Aldrin was a certified genius, but wasn’t well liked. He was not initially selected for Gemini - 12 would normally have been crewed by Stafford and Cernan, who instead found themselves on 9 after the prime crew (See and Bassett) were killed. Suddenly a new crew was needed for 12, and that was when Aldrin finally got his shot. Gemini 12 was the most successful of the lot, largely due to Aldrin’s suggestions after studying the previous flights. The mission was extended to four days, Aldrin took greater care and more rests during his spacewalks, and handholds and other elements were added to make his EVA tasks easier.But Collins had flown first. That put him in line for a prime Apollo slot earlier - Apollo 9, to be precise, while Aldrin was backup for Apollo 9 and expected to fly on Apollo 12. The crews of 8 and 9 (and their backups) ended up switching, so that Collins would now fly 8 and Aldrin 11. Collins had a herniated disc in his back and dropped out of 8 - he would be back in the rotation on 11 alongside Aldrin, with Armstrong as commander.Now, why did Collins have the CSM slot and “have to” stay in orbit, while Aldrin “got to” land on the Moon? Again, because Collins was senior. The CSM pilot was effectively second in command - partly because all three crew needed his training to get home, and partly because on Apollo 7 and 8 (flights without Lunar Modules) the putative LM pilot didn’t have a LM to fly, so that job went to the junior man in the crew.

They knew they were long but not by how much. They had Michael Collins attempt spot Eagle on the surface as he passed over on each orbit. If they could determine exactly where they landed, they could calculate when Eagle had to launch in order to rendezvous with the command module.The rendezvous plan called for Eagle to launch into a lower circular orbit behind Columbia. Lower orbits go around the moon faster so Eagle would slowly catch up with Columbia. They had a rendezvous radar on the lunar module that could spot the command module from a long way away. Once the predetermined angle was reached between the two craft, the lunar module did the final burn to raise its orbit to match the command module on the other side of the moon. It all had to be timed so the lightning would be right and both craft could communicate with mission control. All but the last docking maneuver was done by Eagle so that none of the fuel reserves on Columbia would be wasted as they were needed to get them home. Eagle’s resources would not be needed once the two craft were docked after returning from the moon.","35,160 followers",C Stuart Hardwick,8.3K,12.3K,143M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-will-happen-if-an-astronaut-fires-a-gun-from-the-Moon-aiming-at-Earth

On only a couple of occasions did the LMP “fly” the LM, and that was by the indulgence of the CDR, such as when CDR Pete Conrad allowed LMP Al Bean to perform some maneuvers during Apollo 12.The CMP, by contrast, was going to fly solo around the Moon, for up to several days during the later landing missions. No one to back him up except Mission Control, and he had to be an expert on all the spacecraft’s systems and scientific and technical tasks to be accomplished on lunar orbit (which were extremely numerous; the CMP didn’t just hang out and wait for the LM to return).Most importantly, if the LM was unable to achieve the desired altitude on liftoff due to a malfunction, the CMP would have to perform a very fast and challenging rendezvous maneuver to retrieve them - again, completely solo.So no - while Collins and the other CMPs wanted to make a landing as much as anyone, and most hoped for their own subsequent missions as CDRs, it was very far from ‘disappointing’ for any of them to be assigned as CMP. Just getting a flight assignment at all was tough enough. With the exception of geologist Dr Harrison “Jack” Schmidt, LMP on Apollo 17, the Apollo astronauts were all active or former military pilots with flight test or engineering backgrounds. They took their assigned roles very seriously.","3,603 followers",Mark Shulmann,2K,2.2K,34.5M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-will-happen-if-an-astronaut-fires-a-gun-from-the-Moon-aiming-at-Earth

I could name each and every Apollo astronaut, and rattle off statistics like a human version of Top Trumps. I could recognise most of the satellites (that we knew about), and could point out many, many constellations, telling you what stars they were made up from and what creature they represented.With personal projects, we were expected to write to a relevant organisation to get some information to make our projects stand out. Naturally I wrote to NASA. I asked for some moon rock (of which I'm still waiting…), some astronaut autographs and some posters.A few weeks later a large box arrived at school with the NASA worm logo all over it. I was amazed that NASA had actually sent me a moon rock. They hadn't, but what they did send caused some confusion lasting many years.Inside the box was a package of photographs of every astronaut up to that date, many autographed, and each with a label on the back detailing who it was and what mission they completed. There was also loads of stickers, posters and a few model rockets.It was the photos which caused my confusion. Although I had memorised many facts about each astronaut, Collins included, I had never seen a picture of him, so when one arrived in the box, I was really happy. I could finally see what he looked like. And as it was provided by NASA and labelled appropriately, I had no reason to doubt it's authenticity.My picture of Michael Collins showed a proud black astronaut, posing in his orange ACES suit. For years after this, I knew Collins was black.It was only when watching a documentary about the early days of NASA many years later that I discovered the mistake. Footage of the Apollo 11 crew training, and in flight, didn't show my proud black guy, but some white dude. They had obviously made a huge mistake. Then I realised some of the flight footage was taken on the way to the moon, so they couldn't have made a mistake, but had in fact mistakenly mislabelled a picture of one of the most famous astronauts in history.My picture of Michael Collins was actually that of Guy Buford Jr, the first African American in space.

They were ALL highly intelligent, superb pilots, cool under pressure, highly analytical, and brave as lions. But, within those parameters, there was lots of room for variation. Long term relationships are built on compatibility of interests and temperament; Armstrong and Aldrin were about as different as two astronauts could be. Armstrong was the ultimate technical test pilot type. Precise. Cool. Skillful. A master of the machine he commanded and of its capabilities. He had little use for theory—he was there to take his machine out on a mission and make it do what it was supposed to do.Aldrin was more of a prototype for the scientist/astronaut who would be a mainstay of the shuttle missions. Sure, he was a capable and aggressive fighter pilot, but he also had a graduate degree in orbital mechanics and did his thesis on the theoretical basis of space rendezvous. He was very much at home with theory, higher mathematics, orbital mechanics, and other highly technical subjects. He was more of a “thinker” and Armstrong was more of a “doer,” with the understanding that both men were both outstanding thinkers and doers—it was a matter of intellectual/temperamental emphasis. One of the best illustrations of the difference is that Armstrong described his view of the lunar surface as “beautiful” while Aldrin called it “magnificent desolation.”The differences between these two men appear very starkly in the debriefing transcripts (I can’t find the link right now—I’ll try to come back and insert it later). Armstrong had more useful information about the performance of the spacecraft, what it was like to fly the LM, how maneuverable it was, how easy it was to control the rate of descent, and so on. Aldrin had more detailed observations about the lunar surface, how the dust behaved, how much the soil (regolith) compacted, the apparent color of the stars and the Earth, how far he could see, what the shadows looked like, and other observations of more interest to scientists than to future pilots of this particular class of spacecraft.Another stark difference is the extent to which Aldrin was comfortable as a public person and liked attention while Armstrong stopped doing public appearances and signing autographs as soon as he was able to get away with doing so. Armstrong even instructed that he be buried at sea, presumably because he did not want his grave site to become a shrine (of course he had served in the Navy so this theory could be wrong). But, you can see how different these men were. It is no surprise that they did not become buddies.[Revised 13 January 2018—extended the discussion a bit, reorganized the text, made some editorial changes, added a bit of additional information, added image and caption.]","3,603 followers",Mark Shulmann,936,2.2K,34.5M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-best-way-to-quickly-describe-Quantum-Computing-to-someone-who-does-not-understand-what-it-is
