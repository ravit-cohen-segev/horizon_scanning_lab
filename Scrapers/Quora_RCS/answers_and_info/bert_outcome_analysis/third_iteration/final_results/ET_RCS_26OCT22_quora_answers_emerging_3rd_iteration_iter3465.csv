And he knows he's got the skills to do it.Like all good villains, our Tony begins with nothing but the noblest of intentions. He burns to make the world a better place. And he knows he's got the skills to do it.Born to a life of modest privilege in the United States, Tony rapidly asserts his abilities to build a global technological empire. He develops revolutionary new forms of sustainable energy just as the world's oil supplies reach a critical level. As the middle east descends into a decade of conflict, the world rebuilds using his patents and products.For the most part, people are grateful.By the age of 40 he has a fortune to compare with the likes of present-day Buffet and Gates. Success, of course, is boring. His focus turns.Tony sees the abject poverty of Africa as the greatest remaining blight on the world, and resolves to try to bring it to an end. And he believes he can.He decides only a radical solution is viable: the construction of a new city, which he will fund as a gift. Pitching to several African nations, he offers to employ hundreds of thousands of local civilians which he will train, together with foreign specialists to produce a city capable of housing and employing millions.As part of the deal, Tony retains 20% of the most central land, with the remaining majority to be a gift to the nation and the people who helped build it. In exchange, Tony seeks substantial political concessions, including legalisation of virtually every scientific practice and substantial tax breaks.Despite great reservation, controversy, and accusations of modern-day imperialism, the plan proceeds. Within a decade - bolstered by modern construction methods - a new metropolis rises.Meanwhile Tony has taken advantage of his new nation state, and invests heavily into genetic research forbidden almost everywhere else in the world; particularly the modification of the human genome.His efforts do not go unnoticed. Rising figures in the United States consider him a threat to the future of humanity. Even as his company produces medical revolution upon revolution - a cure for Alzheimers, a simple injection for regrowing damaged heart tissue - these are met with active hostility: did the ends justify the means?Reacting to growing public tension, many countries outlaw these products even as members of their public beg for them.Business for Tony is exceptional of course, and the growing tensions only seek to make his city - as it has become known, colloquially as 'Stark' -  one of the most desirable places to live in the world. He moves himself and swathes of his company there as it expands.It is not long before his science develops the ability to modify human genes in living patients; and ultimately in unborn ones. People could choose to have their DNA 'optimised' through a simple blood scan and synthesised viral injection.This is too much for the world.Within Stark and their growing collection of neighbouring cities, this technology allows them to virtually eliminate all birth defects, disease, low intelligence, physical imperfections and extend long life. Soon this extends to the augmentation of skills: eidetic memory, motor control, exceptional high intelligence. Changing your DNA becomes as commonplace as upgrading your operating system.The rest of the world panics; the United States in particular. It is soon realised that making Stark's technology illegal was not enough: a single person who had been 'optimised' could sell their sperm or eggs for a fortune. To public cries of ""protect our gene pool"", and the fear of rendering 'normal' people obsolete, borders are closed, products are banned, and a near war-like stance against Stark's country is adopted.Tony is no fool, and he's well prepared when the inevitable happens.The US fakes a foiled terrorist attack on their soil. Using this as justification, a coalition of all-too-eager US / EU forces prepares to invade the city of Stark and depose Tony by force.Unfortunately for them, this is where you make a villain out of a genius.The military of the future is not so different from today; the US enjoys a sizeable advantage over the rest of the world combined, and nearly all their might stems from unpiloted drones and long range missiles. Stark has essentially no military force whatsoever, bar police and security officers who were quickly stationed on the border.Their first attack was therefore predictable, if callous: there were no military targets for the coalition to attack, so they focused on aviation, industry and power instead. It didn't really matter.The US drones fell from the skies like stones. The missiles looped back upon themselves and crashed impotently into the ocean. Every automated technology the coalition could muster was all too easy for a technologically superior nation to deflect: targeted electromagnetic pulses, total satellite interference, remote hijacking of computers and communication.No countermeasure was perfect of course, and many hundreds died. Yet the humble civilian city had left a vast military armada confused and humiliated.Tony now broadcasts a simple message to the world, speaking over a montage of severed and charred civilian corpses. ""Many of you think us evil. Yet we live in peace, isolated, our only crime is the pursuit of science that would end disease and enrich the lives of mankind's descendants. For this, your governments rain death upon our people. Ask yourselves if that is really what you want, for what follows is their doing. Until they withdraw, we will not stop.""For an hour, the world waited.Agents for Stark's cause had not been hard to find, and for the most part they were smart, secretive and organized. On cue they crippled global communication, commerce, and transport of the coalition rivals, all in just a few hours. They simply killed their power.Conflict continued, but not for long. Every attempt to recover, to strike back, was blunted by Stark's technical supremacy. When Tony crashed an array of foreign satellites on demand, the coalition ordered a withdrawal.A battered and bruised world came to acknowledge: they had lost.In a few years the ideological opposition to his technologies and even methods soon withered in the face of the practical advantages. As nation upon nation lifted their restrictions on Tony's science, policing genetic purity became impractical, and then impossible. Soon, those countries who opposed him were modelled in his image.You might think this a meagre victory, but consider: he died old, the richest man to ever have lived, near emperor of his own nation, having ultimately transformed the very identity of humanity for eternity. And he had quite literally taken on the rest of the world and won.As a wise man once said: ""You either die a hero, or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain.""(I had this idea for a book ever since I was 17 or so. You can probably guess I was dying to share it somewhere).Update #1:Update #2:","127,777 followers",Oliver Emberton,22.2K,113,19.1M,2013,https://www.quora.com/Why-are-school-buses-not-yet-capable-of-having-SiriusXM-With-advanced-technology-I-think-school-buses-should-have-SiriusXM

I believe studies show that they are less likely to be affiliated with a specific denomination. My suspicion is that a combination of factors, including clergy scandals, overpoliticization, dogmatic rules that don’t make sense to modern audiences, and wide exposure to different belief systems that contradict childhood indoctrination have led people to be more willing to consider matters of faith to be personal and not requiring the conformity demanded by many organizations.","5,990 followers",Jens Böttiger,566,2.6K,17.6M,2019,https://www.quora.com/In-James-Camerons-Aliens-its-established-by-colonists-had-been-living-on-LV426-for-over-20-years-Given-the-advanced-technology-of-this-lore-how-did-no-one-discover-the-derelict-spacecraft-sooner-than-they-had

As I type this reply, I’m listening to a beautiful Indian classical music recording by the Hindustani singers, Rajan and Sajan Mishra. Here’s a sample recording of theirs on You Tube, not the one I’m listening to, but it will serve to make the point. As you listen to these magnificent musicians, even if you don’t understand the lyrics or the genre of music, you can still make out the melody, the harmony, the rhythm, the sound of the drone in the background, the emotion of the singers etc. In short, our brains effortlessly unpack all this information as easily as we breathe. Yet, even with a billion GPU machines, you would not be able to extract the same level of information.Part of the magic here is that the human brain is orders of magnitude more sophisticated than the most complex deep learning network ever built, most of which use cartoon like representations like RELU gates as the basic computing unit. Here’s are some sample activation units used as the building blocks in modern deep learning networks.These are all childishly simple compared to the complexity of one single neuron in the human brain, shown below. I spent a whole semester studying the workings of a single neuron. Some researchers in neuroscience spend their entire careers on this topic. A single neuron is fiendishly complex, and its behavior has been modeled by a complex set of partial differential equations that tries to capture neuronal dynamics. Hodgkin and Huxley got the Nobel prize for their model of a single neuron.Now, here’s the kicker. We have roughly 100 billion of these neurons, and each neuron is connected to as many as a thousand other neurons in a highly structured but complex three dimensional network. The new field of connectomics is trying to accurately model the 3D structure of every neuron in the human brain and it’s a hugely challenging task, even if you restrict yourself to a simpler insect like a common housefly (which has a million neurons). Here’s the connectome of a house fly.But this is the just the beginning of the challenge. Unlike the smooth activation functions used in the toy deep learning models, which bear no resemblance to the real ones in our brains, neurons in biology are largely based on spike trains, communicating with their neighbors with what looks like a complex version of Morse code. In short, simple ideas like backpropagation used everywhere in deep learning are profoundly wrong. The brain cannot work using back propagation and this fact has been known for more than three decades.So, the hundred billion neurons in our brains are all chattering to each other in this mysterious language that we are unable to decipher. So, like the drunkard who’s looking for his car keys under a street lamp not because he lost it there, but because there’s light there, AI researchers in deep learning study cartoon models of the human brain that are simply wrong at every level. They do this out of frustration, largely because it’s too hard to model the real brain. We just don’t have good models of spike train dynamics to be useful in deep learning research, yet this is probably the single biggest reason why the brain is so efficient in terms of power consumption. The brain has more computing power than the most sophisticated super computer ever built, yet unlike these behemoths which require gigawatts of power, the brain happily runs on a few watts of power. The spike train design is the biggest reason why our brains are so efficient.Now, the mysteries of the human brain are much much deeper than the sheer number of neurons using complicated inter connectivity and spike train dynamics. The whole human body, including the brain with all its 10^{15} connections, has to be encoded in the human genome, which is about 30 billion base pairs of letters — A,T, C and G for the four amino acids that encode hereditary information. We know the genetic language really well but not well enough to know how it could possibly encode connectivity information that is billions of times larger than the bits in the genome. It’s truly a miracle. It’s like you buy a computer from Apple, but you don’t get the computer, just a tiny strip that you put in a solution when you get home, and watch as it turns into a highly sophisticated supercomputer!The mysteries of the brain only get more puzzling and more insurmountable, the deeper you dig into its workings. It turns out that as the brain develops and grows, neurons are born and move physically to their designated final location. Even more bizarre, many of them don’t survive this trip. How could this design ever work? The computing elements are created, transported and a lot don’t survive the trip.So, in short, the puzzle we are trying to figure out is how to build the most sophisticated supercomputer there is, which runs on ten watts of power, which grows from a single cell, uses complex spike train dynamics to convey information that simply rules out gradient descent type learning models, where individual computing units are a million times slower to respond to changes in input compared to those used in this iPhone on which I’m typing this answer, and yet can effortlessly understand auditory, visual, language and motor control behavior than any computer ever designed by humans.It’s the mystery to end all mysteries. If we understood the human brain, we would posses immense power, both for good, and sadly for evil as well. Perhaps that’s why nature guards her most precious secrets so carefully. Perhaps some mysteries are best left unsolved. We understand what’s happening in galaxies a billion light years from earth, can study the dynamics of black holes colliding and releasing more energy than that produced by all the trillions of stars in the observable universe. But we don’t know the process by which this porridge like substance between my ears, centimeters from my iPhone, decided to turn my thoughts into (hopefully coherent) Quora replies.Perhaps that’s as it should be. We can understand the physical universe around us, but not the mental universe inside our heads. Understanding the physical universe has given mankind colossal power, and as the number of wars, each with more destructive power than the previous ones, have shown, we have still not learned to master our instincts for wanton destruction. Imagine the power we could unleash if we understood the mental universe as well.",110 followers,Joey Kim,11.2K,857,11.2M,2018,https://www.quora.com/In-James-Camerons-Aliens-its-established-by-colonists-had-been-living-on-LV426-for-over-20-years-Given-the-advanced-technology-of-this-lore-how-did-no-one-discover-the-derelict-spacecraft-sooner-than-they-had

To illustrate, if you asked a secretary to type 100 letters from scratch whose typing speed is five minutes per letter, it would take 500 minutes, or just a little over eight hours to type all 100 letters, right? That’s serial processing, one thing at a time; one thing after the other. On the other hand, if you had 50 people, each able to type at the same 5-minutes per letter speed, then it would only take 10 minutes to complete the 100 letters. That’s parallel processing, doing many things at the same time. Very powerful.Although serial processing on home computers went by the wayside in the early 2000s almost all of today’s computers use parallel processing.The fastest computer in the world right now is the Fugaku in Japan.* It has nearly 7.3 million cores [that process in parallel] and a speed of 415.5 petaFLOPS. A FLOP is a single floating-point operation. For example, two numbers added, subtracted, multiplied, or divided is a single FLOP. PETA is a prefix meaning a quadrillion of something. The “S” in petaFLOPS means (per) second. A megaflop is a million FLOPS, just like a megabyte is a million bytes of data. Without getting any more technical than that—and I know there are experts out there who could be much more precise than I am here, so bear with me—these are just rough ideas and calculations to arrive at an overall comparison. So, a rough calculation would be that if it took a person, working at a rate of, say, 5-seconds to do 1 floating-point operation on a hand calculator, it would take a human with a hand-calculator working at 24/7/365, over 600 times the age of the universe to equal what the Fugaku could do in one second. Think about it. It sure sounds like the Fugaku would have a huge advantage over a human brain, wouldn’t you think?Although the internal transmission of signals in the human brain is much slower than that of Fugaku, the brain operation is massively parallel across approximately 100 billion cells (neurons), compared with Fugaku’s 7.3 million cores. Each neuron is interconnected to as many as 10,000 others, amounting to about a 100 trillion interconnected pathways between neurons. Note also that the connections between neurons in the brain—neuron-to-neuron—are not passive. They perform some operations (computations) in addition to the neuron itself. Also note that while comparing a core processor in a supercomputer to a brain cell seems to be stretching things a bit too far, theComparisons between the operation of the human brain and computers are difficult to make and the legitimacy of any comparisons can be argued endlessly. Besides comparing hardware and “software,” results—output, in terms of the computer, behavior in terms of the human—is another way to compare.The awesome power and speed of the Fugaku is not to be denied. Yet, it cannot get up from an easy chair, go to the refrigerator, browse for something to eat, decide to snap open a cold one, throw some cheese and tortilla chips into the microwave, sit back down in the easy chair, watch a comedy show on television, have a good laugh, read a novel and mentally experience being on a pirate ship in the Caribbean ocean in the 1700s, or cry over the injury of a puppy. A human can cry, laugh, love, experience orgasms, feel empathy, taste food, put him or herself in someone else’s shoes, be conscious, experience music, imagine other times and places, experience wonder, awe, fear, disgust, and excitement. The human brain does this with an energy consumption equivalent to a 20-watt light bulb whereas the Fugaku does what it does using millions of watts. Now that’s some astounding computing.The combination of computer hardware and software that would be necessary to accomplish what a human baby does spontaneously in the space of any given five minute segment of any typical day, would make comparing the Fugaku massively parallel supercomputer to the human brain like comparing a paper airplane to a SpaceX Starship.* Since I’ve written this a new “World’s Fastest Computer” has come on the scene; the Frontier (ODCF-5) supercomputer at OAK Ridge National Laboratory (USDE).In 2022, Hewlett-Packard Packard’s","220,602 followers",Franklin Veaux,1.4K,47.3K,782.8M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-can-we-do-to-stop-advancing-technology-from-taking-over-the-world-by-2100

15,One of interesting examples of an advanced German WWII tech was Zielgerät 1229It was an early example of an active infrared device for the Sturmgewehr 44 assault rifle.The Vampir was first used in combat in 1945 on the Eastern front.The main problem with Vampir was a battery size that weighted 15 kilograms and had to be carried in a backpack. That didn’t make it very practical to use.One of interesting examples of an advanced German WWII tech was Zielgerät 1229It was an early example of an active infrared device for the Sturmgewehr 44 assault rifle.The Vampir was first used in combat in 1945 on the Eastern front.The main problem with Vampir was a battery size that weighted 15 kilograms and had to be carried in a backpack.

17,It wasn't from space.War is terrible but is also a big technology booster. Tech like jet engine was invented by british in 1930 but it was Germans 11 years later who put the patent to opeational use. Our generation's achievements stand on the shoulders of those who preceeded us. And them on generations before. We are blessed with huge brains capable to invent and construct marvels.

20,"Germany had a state propaganda apparatus obsessed with creating an aura of superiority. They rushed wonder weapons into the field way before they were usually ready. Part of that was they were losing badly.The British at this point had the best theoretical science in terms of developing concepts and ideas.The Americans were different. They were the best at fielding technology. What that means is they could make or take an advance and throw mountains of engineering and technician time at it to make it work, make it reliable, and then build a ton of them and use them.For instance the first AmeriGermany had a state propaganda apparatus obsessed with creating an aura of superiority.

When that plane ended up being bad they canceled the orders and ordered what became the P-80 which was designed and had the first prototype flying in 4 monthsGermany would have done a crash program for the L-133 and lived with the resulting teething problems and design flaws. Even still the P-80 had reliability problems on the prototypes but the solution was to test the hell out of them to make improvements before deployment in combat not just toss them into the fray warts and all.",UNKNOWN,Julio Cesar Pino,5K,1.1K,17.3M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-can-we-do-to-stop-advancing-technology-from-taking-over-the-world-by-2100
