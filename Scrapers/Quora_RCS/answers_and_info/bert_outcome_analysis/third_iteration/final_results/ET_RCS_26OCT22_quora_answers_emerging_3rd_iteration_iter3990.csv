Take Socrates, Plato, Aristotle.After millennia of books written (at an increasing pace) about love, faith, society, you name it, it almost seems like everything substantial to be written down has been written down. Philosophers of today can only echo what has been said before. Storytellers can only differentiate themselves so far from stories that have come before. If we look at books published today, ask yourself: what book has been as radically new and impactful as the great works from history?So. Will the same happen to technology? Will there be a time where every possible innovation has been innovated? I fear that there will be. Either out of no choice or because we become indifferent about innovation. Let me explain.ASML is the largest manufacturer of machines that create microchips. Their technologies have become so advanced that they create machines that can work on the microscopic level. And during my visit there, they told me how it became increasingly difficult to work on a smaller scale. In short, ASML was reaching the limits of what is factually possible. ASML is confronted with the limits of the laws of physics. Almost a tragic story.What if that will happen to every branch of technology? What if solar panels reach the limits of efficiency? What if information cannot be transferred any faster? What if lights cannot shine any brighter, robots not faster, computers not smarter?Moore’s Law is slowing down.

It may be not much of a problem from the perspective of an average people. However, when we are talking about 500 kV to 1000 kV electricity, there is nothing too small.2, Laser technology.China is in the leading position of this field. The US spent 7 years to break through the export ban of KBBF (some kind of crystal). By the time the US has made their own KBBF, China already had better ones.This is one of the result of KBBF, laser weapon on type 99 tank. Within 5 km, it has 100% chance to blind opponent. Not just their observation equipment, but human eyes too. (Edit, if you had to stay behind the optical observation devices long enough, then yes. But the weapon itself targets only at vehicles.)3, Limb replantation.There was a case in China, which a person’s hand got shredded into more than 20 pieces. Chinese doctor didn’t just re-assembled the hand from pieces, and even kept most of its function.4, 12306.It’s the name of the booking website of China Railways. In 2018, it had a peak of 150 BILLION visits per day.Considering that it must be maintained 6 hours per day, from 11 pm to 6 am, in average it must be able to deal with 2,314,815 times of visit per second. If we also include the people’s schedules which most of us would purchase tickets within certain time period, the visit pressure would be even higher.All American IT giants turned down the request of China Railways of establishing a ticket system.This is the railway map of China. The main difficulty of building a ticket system for it is actually not the visiting times per day or second. That can be solved by deploying more servers. The real problem is that with 1 ticket being sold, all related routes must correspond with it.In online shopping systems, 1 item is called a SKU. If one purchase an item from Ebay, then the system counts 1 SKU less. However, take the G71 from Beijing to Shenzhen as an example: There are 17 stations and 3 different seat classes, and 408 SKU. If someone purchased a ticket for the full length, then the system would remove 136 SKU from the pool. However, if a tickets between any middle stations is sold, the calculation would get complicated. And this must happens within a very short period of time, since there are over 2 millions visit per day, any of them could be a request to purchase a ticket along this route.Plus, this change must be corresponded among all core hubs, and all terminal machines, including the ticket window, auto selling machine, agents, website, and cellphone APP to make sure not too many over booking.Last but not least, in reality, the situation could only be a million times more complicated than I described. 12306 is now selling 3 billion tickets a year, and is the largest online ticket system.

Andy Mawson, director of operations at GNAAS, came up with the idea and described seeing it as ""awesome"".He said it meant a paramedic could ""fly"" to a fell top in 90 seconds rather than taking 30 minutes on foot. Mr Mawson said: ""There are dozens of patients every month within the complex but relatively small geographical footprint of the Lakes.The test flight was carried out by Richard Browning, founder of Gravity Industries. He said the suits had two mini engines on each arm and one on the back allowing the paramedic to control their movement just by moving their hands. ""The biggest advantage is its speed,"" Mr Mawson said. ""If the idea takes off, the flying paramedic will be armed with a medical kit, with strong pain relief for walkers who may have suffered fractures, and a defibrillator for those who may have suffered a heart attack. ""In a jet pack, what might have taken up to an hour to reach the patient may only take a few minutes, and that could mean the difference between life and death.""The following was the previous ‘wow’ moment:On July 14 last year (according to Quora that is), I answered the question: ““How about a piece of gear that permits the totally blind to see again? The word 'revolutionary' appears in the question, and if anything is revolutionary, by the gods this is it. The invention on which I am about to write has just been revealed. However, it is a rather complicated piece of kit, and I would imagine that it must surely have taken longer than the months of this year already elapsed in order to have been brought the thing to fruition. In the circumstances therefore, perhaps we can overlook the '2018' stipulation in the query and cut to the chase.The device is Orion wireless technology and has been developed by surgeons from Baylor Medical College in Texas and the University of California. It is almost miraculous in that it can give totally blind people back their sight. So, folks who have gone blind through, infections, trauma, autoimmune diseases, nerve problems, glaucoma and so on, will be able to see again. It is at the time of writing, unclear, if individuals actually been born blind, will benefit from the invention. The reason for the foregoing being, that the brain - or rather the visual cortex - will never have learned how to process images in the first instance.The revolutionary aspect of the device is, that the patient's eyes have no role whatsoever to play in the seeing process. They are in fact completely bypassed. It works like this. Electrode chips are planted in the visual cortex at the back of the skull. The patient then dons a pair of glasses mounted with a tiny video camera, which in turn, relays images to the electrode chips, thereby enabling the subject to see again.To conclude, one of the neurosurgeons involved in implanting the Orion system is professor Daniel Yoshor of Baylor, and the company manufacturing the kit is a small American Firm called 'Second Sight'. It should be remembered that these are very early days in the experiments. Nevertheless, they provide the hope of a fantastic future, for tens, if not hundreds of millions of blind people throughout world.”I suppose that it is an invention really rather than an innovation, but who is going to complain at such a marvelous procedure.","64,120 followers",Rami Sivan,615,6.4K,81.9M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-if-the-peak-of-innovative-technology-doesnt-actually-exist-What-then-Should-we-be-scared

Mains are designed with reefing systems that slow their deployment, making openings “softer” and prolonging the life of the parachute assembly. Reserves are designed for fast, consistent deployment, where time and minimal altitude loss are of the essence. Since reserves can be deployed at lower altitudes than mains, let’s discuss reserves.A reserve parachute is designed to open quickly… in the neighborhood of a few hundred feet. The exact distance required to get a reserve fully deployed depends upon several factors including air temperature (and corresponding density altitude) and the weight of the jumper. The most important factor is velocity at deployment. If the jumper is in freefall (at about 176 fps), the canopy will take significantly more distance to deploy than if the jumper has just cut away from a malfunctioned main and has minimal descent velocity.A good (but by no means absolute) rule of thumb is that a reserve should open in about 2.2 seconds at terminal velocity. That pencils out to be about 387 feet. In drop test deployments, I’ve seen reserves fully open within 150 feet. Keep in mind these deployments began with about 100 knots forward speed from the aircraft and zero initial descent rate.Your question suggested you were looking for the minimum SAFE opening altitude. My answer would beI can tell you that it is a very bad thing to be passing through 1000′ AGL without a good canopy overhead. I have, on one occasion, seen my altimeter sweep past 1100′AGL while still in freefall. It was one of those rare amazing goatf@!ks of a skydive. I was saddled out under my main by 700′, but that was FAR too low. I was an Instructor and experienced competitor with over 1000 jumps at the time. I certainly knew better. At 700′, if my main had malfunctioned, I would have had less than three seconds to recognize it and deal with it. It had just been a serious goatf@!k, with another jumper remaining over my back in freefall. He didn’t pull until about 1200′, which put me in a pickle. The smart move would probably have been to hit my reserve at that altitude. And I know, I should have grounded myself and slapped myself silly. I did have serious words with the other guy.In skydiving, fatalities usually occur at the end of a series of errors: One goatf@!k after another.","5,990 followers",Jens Böttiger,566,2.6K,17.6M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-if-the-peak-of-innovative-technology-doesnt-actually-exist-What-then-Should-we-be-scared
18,"That’s kind of a broad question. But let me start with the old-timey round ones, these kind were the ‘first parachutes’ and were used for many many years. The venting and materials changed, but the round stayed the same. Until…..Until the good old square, ram-air type parachutes came into service. These are referred to as ‘sport canopies’ today, and are more like a wing than a parachute (in a grand sense of the term).The round ones are still used in military applications. The military also uses ram airs, but it just really depends on the situation. The round parachute has much more of a downwaThat’s kind of a broad question.

The military also uses ram airs, but it just really depends on the situation. The round parachute has much more of a downward flight trajectory, as this is what you’d want when putting troops behind enemy lines. You don’t want big wings flying circles trying to get soldiers on the ground.Then there’s the reserve. If you look up and see, for instance, something like this on opening your main:Then it’s time to get rid of it, quickly, and get the reserve out. The reserve is always packed by a certified rigger and designed to open QUICK. I’ve had an opening of one at terminal velocity.. talk about a hard and fast opening. It rocked me. Reserves are round or square. Sport ones are most always square.I guess there’s also these ‘cruciform’ canopies? They look a bit scary to me, but hey.. I’ve not jumped in a LONG time.None of the above are to be confused with the below canopies. These are entirely different and NOT meant for skydiving. It’s a wing and a wing only.And if you’re on a drop zone, don’t refer to these paraglide people as “skydivers” around real skydivers. They will definitely make fun of you.Peace!","1,594 followers",Michael Van In,631,1.5K,2.9M,2016,https://www.quora.com/What-if-the-peak-of-innovative-technology-doesnt-actually-exist-What-then-Should-we-be-scared
