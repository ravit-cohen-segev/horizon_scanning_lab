I couldn’t understand why Dad went so far off the rails about something so minor. It was very out of character for him. Normally, he was a gentle soul who rarely raised his voice at anyone.Now that I’m in my early 70’s and have come to realize why older folks can be cranky.For one thing, the obvious: we’ve lived a LONG time and generally put up with a lot of sh$t over the years. Eventually, we get tired of it and tend to be impatient. So, we snap at people or get angry with someone who is not doing something we think should be done faster or another way.For another thing, as we age, we tend to have aches and pains and it gets harder to get up in the morning. We are just plain hurting sometimes and it just makes us come out snarling instead of polite. We are both in our 70’s and in reasonably good health - well enough to travel several times a year, but, I have a bad back that acts up once in a while and my wife has had 5 surgeries in the past 4 years (two knees, two hips and a repair from a fall) so while we are mobile and independent, there is no doubt the ravages of time have taken their toll on our bodies.Also, our mental capacity may be challenged sometimes. We forget things - little things usually - or we have too much on our minds at the same time. I liken it to a computer hard drive being full - we are on overload and just can’t tolerate the stress of having to remember several things at the same time. I’m forever making lists so I can keep things in order.Finally, and this is a bit sad, but we’ve lost people - important people - in our lives by the time we are 70. They died. Grandparents, of course, but parents, aunts, and uncles, cousins, siblings, dear friends. Without the network, we had growing up all of our lives for love, comfort, and company, life is more lonely and melancholy and tougher to deal with.All these combined leave us sort of angry all the time. I think of some of my lost friends every day and it makes me unhappy that they are no longer around for me to have fun with.Being aware of all these things helps. I’m pretty good at self-analysis so I attempt to control my temperament. When I’m confronted by some damn fool who doesn’t understand what I want or who takes my order wrong at the drive-in or who is just annoying somehow, I try and control my response and mood.I also have to try and adjust myself at home with my wife. It’s very easy to slip into a pattern of snapping and bickering with someone you’ve lived with a long time - in our case 50 years. Again, I remember my parents barking at one another all the time in their later years. My mother couldn’t hear well and my father got frustrated at her not being able to hear him. It was sort of funny if it weren’t people I was so close to. My mother would ask my father over and over again to repeat himself and by the third time he was shouting at her and she would say, hurt, “Why are you yelling at me?”So every once in a while, when I find myself being snippy to my wife, I readjust myself and think “be kind” she’s as old as I am! We also do a lot of traveling on planes and boats which is very stressful and I have to really work hard to make sure I don’t let the moment ruin what is supposed to be a pleasant vacation.In the evenings, we have a few drinks and that helps our mood.With all of our travels, we’ve come in contact with a lot of people our age and older and the ones we are most impressed with, and the ones who’ve adopted a positive attitude and don’t let life get them down.A sense of humor is essential after age 65.Us in our early 20’s visiting my parents in Florida (1973) My Dad passed at 88 and my Mom at 92. My wife’s Mother lived to be 82 and her Dad just after he turned 90.In Norway in 2018, at age 71. We spent our 50th Anniversary on a riverboat in Portugal this past August 2019.","2,056 followers",Timothy X Rowe,10K,3.2K,15.6M,2021,https://www.quora.com/How-do-you-engage-senior-citizens-with-technology

And that is what is usually on the menu with all these old men. Besides, they do not want women my age. Oh, no, they are looking for swanky 21 year olds who are plentiful if they have a big fat bank balance, which many of them do in this town. We are not short on millionaires here.I love living on my own and have no intention of being tied down again. I eat when I like and go out when I want. And there really isn’t anything better than having complete control of the remote and the thermostat.There is an activity center in my town which provides very reasonably priced four-course meals on week days. I have ventured in there a couple of times and ended up sitting on my own surrounded by little cliques of blue-haired women yacking about God-only-knows what. Probably gossiping about the neighbors.I once plonked myself down next to a pleasant looking guy and was surprised that he had a lot to say, and was not at all boring. We swapped notes on all kinds of things. He was an Anglophile and we had many laughs talking about all the British comedies. I was so taken with that conversation that when we left I impulsively asked him if we could have lunch together another day. He almost jumped out of his shoes. ‘Oh, no,’ he said, frowning at me as if I was a psychedelic monster, or something. ‘I don’t think my wife would like that’. I wasn’t asking him to jump into bed with me, for Christ’s sake. I only wanted a bit of conversation.Once, a while back, I was invited to a party by one of the richest guys in town. He is President of this and that and a big philanthropist for the arts. We met in a restaurant where I was dining with friends. I was at the desert bar (I always head for the deserts first there, before the entrees, as their chocolate meringue pie is to die for) and there he is, hair as white as salt, 7′ 8″ tall or something, towering over me. I had no idea who he was, but didn’t think a party would be any cause for alarm.I dressed up to the nines in my brand new slinky black dress, backless no less, and hopped off in my impossibly high heeled shoes to the party on my own. Guess what, nobody, but nobody spoke to me at all. I stood at the buffet for about an hour, nibbling on the exquisite shrimp canapes, and bitterly regretted that I had gone to all that trouble to get dressed up. I could have been tucked up in my pj’s at home, watching my mini-series on Netflix.But there I was at this extraordinarily glamorous party, all done on a very grand scale, caterers and all, and brimming over with all the ‘in’ people in my town - mostly over 60 years old.I wandered over to the balcony above ‘Mr. Rich guy’s’ palatialI sipped on my Champagne and toyed with my ring. Then what do you know, ten minutes later, here comes Mr. Rich guy once again, hovering beside me. ‘Did you say you had been widowed for seven years?’ I told him that was right, and thought he must have a screw loose, or something. More silence, more hovering, then another departure.Well, I had had quite enough of that, so I swiped a nice fat chocolate eclair from the buffet, got in my car and went home. What a relief it was to climb into my pj's and watch the next in my mini-series on Netflix.So much for old geezers in this town.

Imagine if your all-too-trusting grandmother went to the shadiest used car lot in town to buy you a new used car, and began by making sure the salespeople knew that she didn’t know a thing about cars, but she had plenty of money to spend on one.That’s what some administrators are like to educational technology salespeople.“So, Mrs. Smith… I see here that the students at your school aren’t scoring so well on standardized tests… Well, I have just the thing for you: a subscription to a math program for all of your students. It’s just $20 per month per student, one-year minimum contract, 300 students minimum. We’ll even throw in a one-hour training course for all of the teachers who will use it, right in the middle of their summer vacations. Whaddaya say?”Many years ago, I taught at a school that had six different online, third-party, pay-per-student programs. Each student was enrolled in no fewer than three programs, which, of course, the teachers were expected to use consistently… their own lesson plans and best practices be damned. I had two days per week when I could teach what I thought the students needed to learn. The other three days were online instruction via different, expensive-so-you-must-use-them programs. Not surprisingly, the students didn’t do as well that year as they’d done in previous years. I was able to convince my administrator to scale back two of the programs that I thought were not worth the money.And don’t even get me started on hardware that teachers are expected to use because the administrators were suckered into buying them. I once wrote about my experience with an administrator who was swindled into spending the entire tech budget on Smartboards for all of the teachers, but wasn’t told that those Smartboards would also need to be hooked up to computers and projectors:Matthew Bates's answer to What is the most “technologically illiterate” thing you’ve ever seen someone do?Then there are the administrators who spend small fortunes on laptops for the students, because that’s what the students in all of the educational magazines have, but they forget to invest in servers, routers, high-speed internet, or charging stations for those new laptops, thus making them essentially useless.My advice is this:If you are an administrator, ASK THE TEACHERS what technology they’d like for their students and in their classrooms, and be prepared for teachers who say “none, thank you.”If you insist on going with one-to-one student tech, make sure your think about all of the behind-the-scenes stuff that makes that tech run smoothly. And, for God’s sake, be consistent with the tech you purchase each year. If you’re going with iPads, stick with iPads. Don’t just buy whatever is cheapest at any given time.","2,708 followers",Grammarly,935,0,0,2020,https://www.quora.com/How-do-you-engage-senior-citizens-with-technology

For example by following the outline of an NABC pitch or Business Model Canvas.And on the day of the presentation, be that guy or girl who really owns this stuff, uses technology that runs without any hiccups (be there an hour beforehand to make sure everything runs), and then sits there comfortably and blabs away confidently, with a bit of a joke every now and then, including the audience by alluding to them and issues they would be familiar with and how that connects with the material that is shown.Great pictures, good pace, proper structure.

The basic goal I feel parents need to achieve with their child about education is to instill a passion for lifelong learning within the child. This will serve them better than anything else, and whichever way possible. Some big advantages of technology over non-technology is that there are simply some things that would take too much time/money/effort to really accomplish the same interactive experience without technology. Technology after all makes our lives easier by saving cost, time, and effort. Instead of just reading about the bald eagle in a book and seeing a still picture of one, the child can hop onto several zoo's websites where there is a live webcam feed of the bald eagle sitting perched or maybe if you are lucky where new baby bald eagles are about to hatch. Instead of simply solving a bunch of math problems on a piece of paper, the child can play one of the many math-related apps, some of which tries to put effort in simulating scenarios where people use math in everyday life or to solve a mystery. Instead of reading history like a Revolutionary War battle, the child can watch a video of a war reenactment to get the imagery and sense of what the soldiers were probably feeling. Sure, one can experience these things without technology, but that would mean they and ultimately the parent(s) would have to make time to go to the zoo, engage the math scenarios, and visit places that do war reenactments.

Our team at Grammarly has compiled a handy list of common grammatical errors to help make your writing accurate, clear, and professional.Ambiguous (“Squinting”) modifiersA squinting modifier is a misplaced modifier that, because of its location in a sentence, could modify either the phrase that precedes it or the one that follows it. In the example sentence, is the subject listening to music slowly or slowly getting a headache? To correct a squinting modifier, move its position in the sentence to clarify to the reader which word you intend to modify.Misuse of lie/layIf you plan to place or put an object somewhere, such as a plate on a table, you should use “lay.” If you intend to stretch out on a bed for a nap, you should use “lie.” The verb “lie” is an intransitive verb, which means it does not need an object. The transitive verb “lay” requires an object.It may take some getting used to this “lay” or “lie” business; after all, misuse of these verbs is common. But if you remember to lay down your fork before you’re full, then you won’t have to lie down later from overeating.Comma splicesHe was very hungry, so he ate a whole pizza.To splice means to connect or join. When a writer joins two independent sentences with a comma instead of separating them with a period or coordinating conjunction, that’s a comma splice.The comma has its jobs to do, but connecting two independent sentences isn’t one of them. Besides, the period gets testy when his sister, the comma, steals his thunder. Periods have their jobs, and so do commas, but never the twain shall meet—unless it’s in the form of a semicolon. Semicolons can also take the place of a coordinating conjunction, such as “and,” “but,” or “so,” among others.Run-on sentencesRun-on sentences, also known as fused sentences, occur when two complete sentences are squashed together without using a coordinating conjunction or proper punctuation, such as a period or a semicolon. Run-on sentences can be short or long. A long sentence isn’t necessarily a run-on sentence.To avoid run-on sentences, see if there is more than one idea communicated by two or more independent clauses. In our examples, there are two complete sentences:Example:Example:Both sentences are complete ideas by themselves; therefore, use a semicolon or a period to indicate that they are separate independent clauses.Using “could of” instead of “could have”“Could have” is always correct; “could of” never is. Writers probably make this grammar gaffe because, when we speak, the contraction “could’ve” sounds an awful lot like “could of.”TautologiesTautologies express the same thing twice with different words. In our example, the word “made” implies that Jack used his own two hands to create the pail. The prepositional phrase “with his own hands” creates a redundancy.
