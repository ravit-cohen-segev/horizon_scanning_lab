The difference is one wakes up in the year 2018 and the other wakes up in 1818.The latter wakes up chilly, to the sound of a rooster crowing, from a bed of straw he shares with lots of bedbugs. Neither his night shirt nor his bedding is terribly clean, and he splashes water on his face from a bowl to help wake up before looking outside to try to guess what the weather will be like today. He, like all of his family and most people he knows, is a farmer, so the weather matters a lot to him, and any other news will be a long time coming, including that his brother, who lives just a couple towns away, broke his leg a few days back and passed away from an infection. He works from sun up to sundown because he has little machinery and he would probably work longer if he had access to something better than candles to provide light.Our other man wakes up in 2018 to the sound of an alarm clock, he is not hot or cold because his home has central heating. His pajamas and bedding are quite clean because he has a washer and dryer. He is a bit groggy because he can light his home at the flick of a switch so often stays up later than he should. Fortunately he has hot coffee and a hot shower to help him wake up, and he checks his email while drinking that coffee and listening to the news and weather. He already knows his brother broke his leg a few days back, even though he lives a long distance away, and of course he does not die from an infection, he’s just at home bored and probably would welcome a phone call.These are two very different lives. They are separated by three centuries, a dozen generations, and a slew of inventions both major and minor. Those inventions, major and minor, have altered our civilization profoundly during that time. My answer however is not those inventions, but rather the ones emerging nowadays that will change our lives once more, many of which get little notice in the news.Even those emerging technologies that get reported with much pomp and hype often bypass a lot of the simple yet drastic changes they will bring to how we go about our normal day. A survey of technologies that don’t get talked about a lot, but will change the world we live in, requires introducing those technologies and explaining the potential of each. The trick is that technologies that don’t get a lot of fanfare don’t get it because their value and applications are not too obvious. Fundamentally, technology is about making our lives better, safer, and more convenient. To talk about the impact technology will have on our lives we need to go deeper than just what the technology does, like how a fusion reactor makes electricity cheaper and renewable, an obvious benefit, but also how it alters our day to day life. Cheaper electricity is awesome, an energy source that doesn’t run out or cause environmental problems is awesome, but it is easy to overlook all the other benefits that come along with them.We need to cover several such technologies. So to do this we will walk through a day in the life of two people, Sam, who lives nowadays in the year 2018, and Hannah, who lives just a few generations from now inOkay,What’s interesting about Sam and Hannah’s lives is that they both live in a pretty automated and high tech civilization.We spend a lot of time on this answer talking about futures in Hannah’s Era or even centuries further ahead, and we tend to focus on big things. New spaceships, new energy sources, giant constructs we could build around our own star or other stars and the ships that will get you there. Not today though, for today it does not matter that Ted was actually playing golf in a rotating habitat orbiting the Earth, complaining about how the spin throws off his normal swing. We care that his golf partner was actually lying down at home on his bed playing with him in virtual reality, and that he, Ted, and Hannah were thousands of kilometers apart, but all felt like they were in the same environment chatting, even though they were not in the same place and quite possibly all saw different environments. We don’t care that they have rocket ships with big fusion powered drives that can get to Mars in a week, we care about them having cars they can sleep in, fully relaxed in the knowledge that it could drive through a blizzard without a risk of accident and that if one did somehow happen, a dozen safety systems would pop on deploying airbags and restraints before the vehicle even hit the target, and that if somehow even that wasn’t enough, an automated ambulance would be on the scene in moments with robots controlled by experts hundreds of kilometers away piloting them, and already knowing from the vehicle monitors exactly what happened and where all the injuries were and how severe. We also don’t particularly care that Hannah’s son can do classes online, we already have ever-improving technology allowing that. We care about the automated interactive aspects of that, something called Affective Computing, or computers and systems that can recognize, interpret, process, or simulate human body language and affects. Fundamentally it is this sort of technology that holds the strongest potential to revolutionize our lives.Sure, a student can watch a recorded lecture and pick from several variations of it by other people covering that same topic, just as you can do now on YouTube for instance. But it is aThe Uncanny Valley, our tendency to respond more negatively to things which seem closer to human than further away, is a big hurdle to making such simulations, but if you can get past it, you open the door for books that don’t just get read aloud by some cold disjointed voice, but can be real-time performed like a TV show or interactive virtual environment without needing actors. It’s a lot easier to learn the history of the world when instead of a book or lecture or even historical TV drama, a person can land in that environment where the bits they find boring can be seamlessly detected and altered, so they remain focused on the important knowledge while enjoying themselves. It’s nice to have a test that doesn’t need to have questions checking your reading comprehension, because it already knows what that was from monitoring you while you read, and even nicer if most text can adapt as you’re reading it to rephrase the information or the question to better communicate to you as an individual. It’s like the automatic translator that doesn’t just hear what someone said in another language and translate it word for word, but instead can convert all the idioms and expressions into another language and its own idioms and expressions. It will be even cooler if one day we can just download knowledge and skills into your head, like in the film theWe didn’t focus on cool new power production methods like fusion today, we focused on ways to conveniently get power. Wireless energy transmission by magnetic induction or energy beaming, smaller and better batteries and solar panels, or harvesting energy right from the person. Leaching just a little energy away from every motion, maybe even putting devices in the body that could steal a bit of energy from your own food to transmit it to devices in or on you. IPredicting the future of technology is always a hit and miss game, often in hindsight the stuff is obvious, but can’t be predicted in advance. Some technology and its impact is easy enough to predict, but what makes them inaccurate in most cases is all those tiny secondary advantages and changes and those tend to focus on human desire and convenience. It’s not that hard to predict faster computers, the internet, satellites, or cell phones. What’s hard to predict is people using those to post a picture of what they ate for lunch. Once you do, you can imagine that a lot of restaurants will advertise online and show photos of the menu. It will seem obvious in hindsight that someone is going to make a piece of software that can look at that image and make some smart guesses about its nutritional value and calorie count. It will seem obvious in hindsight that as we get more Affective Computing able to monitor your reactions, your computer will get better at showing you bits of stuff on your social media newsfeed that you’ll enjoy, and that advertisers will be able to hit you with an ad showing a picture of pizza with the toppings you like when you are just getting a little hungry and haven’t had pizza recently, and tomorrow you’ll get shown sandwiches instead. It’s predictable that 3D printers, and fast, cheap, delivery might put a dent in classic retail shopping. It’s predictable that automated vehicles, not needing expensive drivers, will make it much cheaper to deliver things or take a taxi, so that fewer people might own individual vehicles.It’sHowever, it is very easy for us miss a lot of those secondary applications that can quietly sneak in there to revolutionize our lives just as much as landing on the Moon did, or going to Mars will.Have a great day (10 april 2018) !",0 followers,Victoria Hutt,8K,318,5.4M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-best-new-cell-phone-as-of-2019

The only European power still left were the (Germanic) Franks under Charles Martel, who had further expanded the Frankish realm to include most of Western Germany, Northern and Eastern France and the Low Countries.Odo informed Charles of the impending threat of the advancing Umayyad and Charles accepted his plea for assistance. The Umayyad appear to have had very little information about Frankish strength and were headed to the city of Tours, home of the richest and most prestigious abbey in Europe at the time.Charles immediately prepared his army, which consisted of battle-hardened veterans, some of which had been fighting on Charles’ side for fifteen years, and marched south. He deliberately avoided using the Roman road network and instead marched over the mountains and through the forests in order not to be noticed. Indeed, all accounts agree that the Umayyad were caught by surprise when they saw the Frankish army blocking their way in a forest uphill, with hills and trees up front and water on either side that protected them against cavalry charges.There are as many army size numbers as there are accounts and historians writing about this battle, ranging from 10,000 to 80,000 Franks and 20,000 to 375,000 Umayyad, but realistically the Franks would never have had more than 20,000 soldiers and the Umayyad probably in the order of 25,000 to 30,000. Nearly all sources agree that the Umayyad army was significantly larger than their opponents’.Charles correctly assumed that the enemy would be compelled to attack in order to continue their march to Tours and therefore he decided to stay put on the hill. This proved crucial. Abd-Al-Rahman, the Umayyad commander, had been outsmarted and outmanoeuvred. He had failed to recognise the importance of marching against the Franks, the dominating power in Europe, first. It is of course true that one should be careful not to leave an enemy (Odo) in the back, but his exhausting campaign against the Acquitaines had weakened his army, plus it had motivated the Franks even more to seek revenge. Furthermore, he was completely caught off guard, had failed to scout the advance of the Frankish army and had no idea about their strength. They were only able to see their front lines through the trees and had no clue about how many men were standing behind them in the forest. Most importantly of all, it had been Charles who had chosen the place for battle, picking a spot which made a cavalry charge less effective because of rough terrain and trees and carefully avoiding flat, open ground. The Franks were highly disciplined and remained firmly where they were in their shield wall formation, without being lured out of their position after the first skirmishes. For a week both armies stood off, apart from the odd skirmish to test Frankish strength. Abd-Al-Rahman was reluctant to attack but he couldn’t afford waiting any longer with winter approaching. It is suggested that most of the Umayyad were dressed for a Northern African climate, not for a continental Europe winter, whereas the Franks were fighting on their own turf and were well prepared for low temperatures. They were not in a hurry.Eventually the Umayyad charged repeatedly with their cavalry on the seventh day, but the Franks resisted the assaults, even though their lines were broken a few times. It must have been the first time since the Roman era that an army of infantry withstood a heavy cavalry charge. The Umayyad who had broken through tried to kill Charles but his personal guard fought them off.Then, something strange happened. A rumour spread through the Umayyad army that the Franks were looting their base camp. Some of the troops immediately broke off the attack in order to secure their loot. It is suggested that Charles had deliberately sent a small party to the Umayyad camp in order to free as many slaves as they could and cause chaos. This succeeded and a large part of the cavalry returned to their camp. To the rest of the army, this must have looked like a full-scale retreat and soon panic broke out, in which Abd-Al-Rahman was killed.Charles ordered his troops not to chase the fleeing enemy as he feared an ambush and they remained at their position until the next day, when scouts confirmed that the Umayyad had indeed retreated.Although this particular battle was certainly not the biggest of the era and casualties were not exceptionally high (est. 1,000 Franks and 10,000–12,000 Umayyad), the importance of it can not be overestimated. The battle of Tours stopped the Muslim advance into Europe and marked the beginning of the end of Muslim presence on the continent. With the Visigoth, Byzantine and Sassanid empires all crumbling or falling to Muslim rule, the Franks were the only real power in the Western World left. If Charles had failed, the whole rest of the World would have fallen. Italy, which would be added to Frankish rule under Charles’ grandson Charles the Great, would have been an easy conquest. England, divided as it was in the 8th century, would not have stood a chance. The Vikings would still have raided, but they would not have been more than a nuisance and not have disrupted Umayyad rule. The Muslims would never stop trying to submit Europe and many times it was a close call (Malta, Constantinople, Lepanto, Vienna,…) but never did they come as close as in Tours. We would all be speaking Arab right now.EDIT:First of all, many thanks to all for the upvotes! :-)Secondly, I'd like to talk here about two of the other important battles that were mentioned in the comments I received:",0 followers,Lucas Martin,6.4K,65,4.2M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-best-new-cell-phone-as-of-2019

He paused for a second, looked like he was thinking about how to respond, and then told me, “you know, as soon as all my kids left for college, the first thing my wife and I did was go to an adult store we’ve been driving by for years and we bought our first sex toy.” We then continued to have a nice conversation. I know from 10 years in this industry, our products are owned by everyone, especially those who are the most vocally against us!So yes, we can make toys for $10 that sell for $80 (there are certain “luxury” female brands which can assist you in turning their $15 investment into a $200 debit to your bank account), but we occasionally need to confront misunderstandings and stupidity, we occasionally will not be accepted into certain organizations, and we will even sometimes face discrimination from people who think that we are dangerous to their children.What I fear most is that as the adult toy industry becomes more accepted, we may face competition from larger companies with big R&D budgets and bigger marketing channels, ending our enjoyment of our oversized margins.","5,360 followers",Valerio Cietto,677,2.4K,9.1M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-kind-of-products-businesses-industries-does-the-world-need-most-for-the-upcoming-century-What-possible-technology-can-change-the-world

19,"A woman in a domestic violence situation called 911, pretending to order pizza.The dispatcher answered the call and told the woman she had dialed the incorrect number.

The perpetrator who came home intoxicated and began to behave violently, was caught and arrested.In that moment, the daughter had to think quickly to protect herself and her mother — a hero!Mr Teneyck encouraged victims from that day onwards, to use the words “pepperoni pizza” as a magic word if the abusive person is in close proximity, when calling 911.I can only imagine how difficult his job is. The amount of patience and emotional control a person needs for this career is admirable. He could have easily brushed it off as a prank call, but his dedication to this woman is inspiring.Sitting on the other side of the phone line, not being able to physically be there in person, but to save someone through your words requires strength.",UNKNOWN,Cory A.

20,"Do you mean what will happen when they stop producing diesel for those cars, or what will happen to a 10 year old diesel car?If they stop producing diesel for the general public to use, food will start costing double or triple what it does now. 90 percent of all farm equipment, including our trucks are running on diesel. So if I have to replace the half a million dollars worth of used equipment with 2 million dollars of electrified equipment you will be seeing a serious price increase in everything you eat that comes from a farm.

We’ve had 135 years of fossil oil based cars so far, and the momentum this has gathered will be hard to power down.My guess for the day the last petrol- or diesel powered car will drive on this earth is the year 2100.
