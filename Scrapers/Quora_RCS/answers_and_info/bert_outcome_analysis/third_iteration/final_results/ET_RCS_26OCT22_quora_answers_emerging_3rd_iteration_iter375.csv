And still, in most companies, the PR function has not evolved in almost a century.Only a few years ago, information sources were centralized. People got their news from a handful of newspapers, magazines, and TV stations. Reporters writing for these news outlets were the main source of information. They were, in a sense, a bottleneck or a monopoly in buyer opinion and education. Inside a company, the public relations function was the practice of informing and influencing these reporters with the intention of getting favorable news coverage.Today, this is an obsolete paradigm as newspapers are moving from print to digital or going out of business. An article printed in this morning’s newspaper is not news anymore, it is history. We learn about the news in real-time via Twitter, Facebook or online news feeds. Millions of amateur and professional writers have become publishers thanks to blogging platforms and other social media channels. Anyone can write news. The problem in the world today is that we have too many news sources, too much to read and too many point of views.PR needs to evolve to a world where everyone is a publisher and traditional media is just one of the voices that influence public opinion.Read more in the post",256 followers,Priyal Gupta,9.7K,0,0,2014,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-top-5-technology-trends-PR-professionals-should-know-about

It’s the key to the smooth functionality of everything from the government to local companies. Without it, progress would halt.These titans, Alphabet (Google’s parent company), Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Microsof look unstoppable. They are the five most valuable listed firms in the world. Their profits are surging. they collectively racked up over $25bn in net profit in the first quarter of 2017. Amazon captures half of all dollars spent online in America. Google and Facebook accounted for almost all the revenue growth in digital advertising last year.Unlike oil, quantity of data is getting bigger everyday, Smartphones and the internet have made data abundant, ubiquitous and far more valuable. Whether you are going for a run, watching TV or even just sitting in traffic, virtually every activity creates a digital trace, more raw material for the data distilleries. As devices from watches to cars connect to the internet, the volume is increasing. some estimate that a self-driving car will generate 100 gigabytes per second(The more data Tesla gathers from its self-driving cars, the better it can make them at driving themselves - part of the reason the firm, which sold only 25,000 cars in the first quarter, is now worth more than GM, which sold 2.3m).Meanwhile, artificial-intelligence (AI) techniques such as machine learning extract more value from data. Algorithms can predict when a customer is ready to buy, a jet-engine needs servicing or a person is at risk of a disease.

Do not be afraid of the complex differential equations.Trying to visualise any situation involving these equations will make life easier for you.Do not solely depend on mathematical knowledge,visualise it's application to the real world.Do you know how many differential equations come into play when a footballer kicks the ball?Solid mechanics,fluid mechanics,theory of elasticity ….all of these will be jumbled up.If you look up any research paper,this simple thing like kicking a football will blow your mind.Thus,Try not to complicate simpler things.4.Be it mechanical or any other engineering,Team management is very important.Be a leader.Be it in your lab groups or project groups,be the one to take everyone forward.If you want to venture into corporate life,this sense of leadership can take you to places.5.Be updated.About almost everything we learn in our course text books are technologies which are way to old for the modern world.So when you step out of college into real life,you are clueless..Watch Discovery Science,National Geographic…stay updated with the technologies incorporated in building the modern marvels,be it the Airbus A380,or the Underground Metro..6.Welcome change.Mechanical engineering does not mean simply sticking to machines and cars.In this current scenario ,biomimetics,geophysics ,material research and many more areas require knowledge of mechanical engineering.so don't be afraid if machines are your nightmare.Genetic engineering may come to your rescue.So always welcome the interdisciplinary approach to engineering,because every major project requires all types of minds and need a leader to work them through.I hope this was satisfactory.Do Upvote and share if you liked it.All the best.","129,177 followers",Jessica Su,3.9K,1.5K,49.7M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-top-25-best-technology-companies-to-work-for-in-the-world

If you throw that constraint out the window, many things are possible.Before you complain that this is not a fair answer, I give you:The Concorde was NOT an economical design and any airline trying to make money would run from that plane. However, both British Airways and Air France operated for quite a long time. Making money is usually the goal, but not always.So, let’s say that money is no object. The government of Qatar has decided to operate the FASTEST ocean liner in the world. How fast would it be?Well, pretty fast.Incat for example is making catamaran ferries that go up to 58 knots:So, we know that 58 knots is possible. However, this is on relatively flat water. The OP specified the ocean. It really depends on where you are trying to go. For example, Richard Branson set a record across the Atlantic averaging 36 knots:The current record crossing of the Atlantic is about 47 knots.However, we have recently seen a revival of foiling. In the sailing world, foiling boats have completely transformed the sport. Foiling sailbots can be as much as twice as fast as displacement hulls.If we think about a no holds barred “maximum effort” ship focused just on speed, it seems like the design would focus on a foiling design or perhaps even an ekranoplan:Since those are technically planes, I’ll exclude them, but you have to love the possibilities there.So, what we have is an ocean going, extremely large hydrofoil. Since engineers live in the real world, most modern designs have focused on catamarans since they’re more economical. However, there is still hydrofoil work going on:So, how fast could an ocean liner go?Well, nobody really knows.Based on current engineering, it seems like is around 40 knots or so but it seems like a completely clean sheet design might be able to crack 50 knots assuming cost was no object.",449 followers,Avinash Sorab,536,77,1.5M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-top-5-technology-trends-PR-professionals-should-know-about
