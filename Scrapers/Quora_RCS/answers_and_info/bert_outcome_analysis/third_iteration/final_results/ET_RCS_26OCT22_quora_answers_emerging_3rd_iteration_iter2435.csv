The chief purpose of his suit is increased durability, and stealth. He needs to be able to take more damage and sneak around unseen.There’s really no point in breaking up the vibranium of Black Panther’s current suit. It already has some of the functionality of Iron Man’s nanotech suit, in that it forms quickly from his little necklace.

Whether we are talking the MCU or the comics. It really is hard to decide.Marvel Cinematic UniverseTony StarkT’ChallaThese two heroes are very cool and well-fleshed-out characters. Based on this, I give the win to Iron Man.Here is my reasoning. The T’Challa we see in the movies, as cool as he is and as (relatively) good a leader he is, we have NEVER seen him show the level of intelligence that Tony Stark possesses. He is smart, yes, but he doesn’t possess the sort of cunning and tactical thinking that his comic counterpart does. Think about it, would the comic version of him ever allow this sort of battle:Happen in his home country? No, he wouldn’t of. In the comics, he is under a LOT more pressure from the outside world than in the MCU. They have the best military tech on earth in the comics, and his tactical thinking allows him to go toe to toe with ATLANTIS at one point. Based on just this, Tony Stark far, FAR outstrips him in intelligence. The Black Panther suit in the movies is a creation of his sister, who is supposedly the rival to Tony Stark (I have my own opinions on that, but that’s another topic).Speaking of the suit, let’s take a look at its capabilities. It is a vibranium nanoweave that can contract into his necklace, and can absorb kinetic energy, then release it in a single wave.And…it has vibranium claws…uuuuuuuuhhhh… That’s it. The suit has no long distance weaponry, it doesn’t grant him anything more than armor, which, by the way, can be overwhelmed with enough firepower, as we saw in his battle against the Wakandan army. It also doesn’t hinder his fighting capabilities, but it really is nothing more than an advanced suit of medieval armor.He is also a good martial artist, and has the extra strength and speed boost that comes with being the Black Panther.Let’s look at Iron Man on the other hand. Tony Stark, genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist. A prodigy from birth, Tony was building circuit boards at age 4, and his first engine at age 6. He is considered one of the smartest people in the MCU, and has proven that his ingenuity knows no bounds. He has built armors to go up against literal gods:(Okay, it wasn’t MEANT to go up against gods but you know what I mean. He held his own for a while there)as well as some of the strongest beings in his universe:And won I might add. All of this compounds the fact that Iron Man is now at a god level in the MCU:He fought Thanos one on one while Thanos had FOUR INFINITY STONES. He destroyed creatures formed by the reality stone. He took the full brunt of a hit from the moon the Mad Titan destroyed using the space and power stones.Heck, he BLOCKED a shot from the Power Stone, you know the stone used to destroy entire PLANETS?The one used to hurt Thor at the beginning of the movie just by TOUCHING him?Yeah, Tony took a blast from that thing. In other words, with that new nanotech Mark L Model Prime armor, there is no way Black Panther can get through his armor now. His vibranium claws MIGHT be able to scratch it, but the suit can just repair itself. He can’t do enough damage in enough time to get to the human underneath it.And none of this takes into account that Iron Man can fly and has military grade weapons mounted on every armor, enough to destroy tanks in a single blow.(One of my favorite photos of him. BTW, that is his Mark III doing that. He is now on Mark L (50). Imagine the difference in firepower now.)So I don’t doubt that with the Mark L he could overwhelm T’Challa’s armor and beat him that way. Or its possible that in his study of Cap’s shield (they imply this at the beginning of AoU) that he has figured out the resonant frequency of T’Challa’s armor and overwhelm it with sonic attacks. (Another thing, FRIDAY showed in AoU in the Battle of Sokovia that she could analyze events happening in real time and study materials unknown to her to find such things. Like when Tony hit the vibranium in the center of Ultron’s asteroid with a specific vibrational frequency to try and destabilize it.)So Iron Man of the MCU wins.COMICSComic wise is a little more difficult.In the comics, T’Challa is not only a born leader, he is essentially Batman of his world. He can outwit practically anyone, and has outdone Iron Man three separate times. Thing is, Tony’s ego is actually a lot bigger than the MCU one’s is (imagine that). He doesn’t believe anyone is better than him, and believes he is infallible…until the day he is fighting Black Panther for the third time, about to win, only for Panther to shut down his arc reactor, or his artificial heart in the comics, with an Ultron virus. What a way to have your ego broken, am I right?He mentions he develops countermeasures for nearly every hero in defense of his country. This T’Challa is FAR superior to Iron Man in tactical thinking. He even rivals Captain America in his prowess. He is also far smarter than his MCU version, with the Black Panther suit’s improvements  being developed by himself and his sister. He has access to a lot more technology, especially in the computer department.BUT!Something I noticed after looking through the three times Black Panther has beaten Iron Man…these all take place BEFORE Iron Man had developed Jarvis. In other words, his suits had no computer defense at these times except the firewalls he put in beforehand.SO! Based on that, this battle could go either way honestly. If Stark is smart and doesn’t let his ego get the better of him, he has some very impressive armors, like the Hulkbuster, Thorbuster, Bleeding Edge, and Endosym armors, that have gone against some of the strongest beings in the world and universe. They could overwhelm Black Panther from a distance, as even when he is wearing the vibranium plated version of the suit, there is a limit of how much damage he can take.But if he decides to try and outdo Black Panther at his own game of hand to hand combat, unless he has the Bleeding Edge armor, which has been shown to move faster than an Extremis soldier was able to track, he is screwed big time. Keep in mind, a NORMAL human can track a human-sized object moving at up to 9000 mph. And an Extremis soldier is even faster.http://i.imgur.com/2CACqyR.pngNow, if he is in the Bleeding Edge, he might stand a chance, as his strength is superior to Black Panther’s and that suit’s speed may even be better. But because T’Challa probably prepared for this, he would have to be very careful about how he engaged. If he moves in for close quarters combat, it will probably be T’Challa’s win. If he goes in with one of his god-level armors, like the Thorbuster (which had to move faster than the speed of light to be able to fight him) It is Iron Man’s win. If he flies out of range of T’Challa, it either goes to him for simply having longer-ranged weapons, or it is T’Challa’s win if they are in Wakandan territory with their AA guns and weaponry.Suffice it to say, this battle is heavily reliant on multiple factors. There is no clear cut winner here. But, because I do need to give someone whom I believe would win, here it is. Essentially, as much as I like him, his ego is too much. Tony Stark would probably be able to win just a little under half the time. The majority of the wins would go to T’Challa for the fact he is much cooler under pressure in the comics and better tactical-wise for battle.The winner of the comics is T’Challa, the Black Panther.(Yes, that is T’Challa smacking Tony Stark lol :P You’re welcome.

6,"I mean, there’s two ways you can go about this concept.Considering Stark developed nanotechnology that was FAR more powerful and technologically advanced than Shuri’s Wakandan “nanotech”, he really probably didn’t need Wakandan technology to improve it much.

The difference is approach to combat; Black Panther uses his suit to supplement his already gifted physique similar to Captain America. Iron Man uses his suit to compensate for his lack of powers with an arsenal of gadgets.Black Panther couldn’t fight in a suit like Iron Man’s simply because it doesn’t fit his fighting style.

Normally knights were pierced at their joints, not through the plating itslelf.So in terms of how close we are to any of these armors (or similarities to them):And keep in mind, I only make this list as a similarity to these armors. We will never quite achieve what they do. We won’t be shattering the Earth or deflecting bullets with our faces ever, and a nanotech, orbital-capable armor or nanotech paint-on armor with the ability to absorb kinetic energy into itself are impossibilities, simply due to physical limits to the world.After all, they are built by people who consider the laws of physics as guidelines, not reality.Granted, we aren’t fighting literal gods and monsters on the daily, so maybe that’s okay.Cheers!",28 followers,Daniel Bradshaw,759,0,0,2021,https://www.quora.com/Does-Black-Panther-have-more-advanced-technology-than-Iron-Man

It’s difficult to imagine them working with metal under water, but they could easily have developed technologies based on other materials: tanned hides and fish skins, chemicals derived from living creatures, tools carved from bone, coral and rocks, things like timepieces to track the tides, needles to sew clothing, ropes and twine twisted from thin strips of tanned dolphin hide, knives and axes made from sturdy shells or from narwhal nhorns and the like. Sharkskin and shark’s teeth would come in handy for making rasps and cutting implements and weapons.Obviously, they could also trade for materials that can’t be manufactured underwater. I would gladly trade my 8″ stainless steel chef’s knife for a string of pearls. Or a toolkit for a handful of doubloons salvaged from a sunken treasure ship. There’s a lot of wealth on the sea floor, and plenty of people who would be willing to act as brokers. And there are resources we haven’t tapped, which mermen and maids could assist with, for a suitable fee.Could they manage an industrial revolution or enter the computer age? Maybe not. Not without assistance from land dwellers, at any rate. But their technology could very well take off in directions we haven’t studied. A biological / technological interface is the obvious direction, breeding plants and animals to fulfill specific functions. Training cuttlefish to repeat patterns of color with their chromatophores and using them to send messages comes to mind. Releasing specific combinations of pheromones into the water as transmitters of ideas or artworks might be a thing. Such a technology could be very advanced in terms of what it can accomplish without being noticed for a very long time by people who weren’t part of the society.If mermaids existed could they develop an advanced technological society? Almost certainly. Would we recognize it if we saw it?

If you were to pile up a bunch stuff (dirt, rocks, whatever), you’d get something with a triangular cross section. Do it carefully to ensure there’s a square floor plan, and you get a pyramid. Tall buildings with walls going straight up and down, like the Gothic cathedrals, are significantly more difficult and technologically sophisticated than pyramids.

All they did was cut some rocks into shape, move them to the pyramid site, and stack them up. The technology was simple and well known, even at the time. Ancient people carved and moved and lifted rocks all the time, even stone age people could do it. All it takes is work.The only astonishing thing about the pyramids is just how much work it took. Lots and lots of work, by thousands and thousands of people, over years and years. So the pyramids are not a demonstration of advanced engineering technology. They are a demonstration of advanced social organization, made possible by the superior agricultural output of the Nile Valley. The Pyramids represent a vast feat of social unity, organizing and supplying and feeding the thousands of workers over the years to construct these monuments. And the end result was an artificial mountain.This is why the pyramids aren’t an especially interesting feat to duplicate today.
