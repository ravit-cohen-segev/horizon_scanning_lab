Focus on growth industries and stocks.The world economy is changing at a rapid pace, with some industries expanding and others contracting. Some of the fastest-growing sectors include cloud computing, e-commerce, financial technology, and healthcare.The technology sector in particular is attractive as a growth industry. Technology innovations drive progress in essentially every other industry, and tech's dominance has only been accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic.Investing inAs for specific stock picks,Stocks such as these may not be the”cheapest” stocks available, but they trade at premiums for good reason. Each of these companies is steadily increasing both revenue and profitability and plays a core role in the modern economy.Since investing in high-growth businesses can greatly increase your portfolio's2. Buy dividend stocks.Investing inThe best dividend-paying companies are those that steadily increase the dividends paid over time. A company that consistently raises its dividend is usually a growing company. To evaluate which companies are best positioned to raise their dividends, consider the free cash out of the company in question.A company with an increasing stock price and dividend can generate significant investment returns over long time horizons. The key is toWhen selecting dividend stocks, don't simply invest in the stocks with the highest dividend yields . An above-average dividend is often a indicator that there's something wrong with the company.3. Invest in ETFs.Buying shares in exchange-traded funds (ETFs) is a great option for investors who don't want to choose individual stocks. These passively managed funds track the performance of certain indexes, have low expense ratio, and can provide exposure to entire asset classes. ETFs, which confer instant portfolio diversification, are also well-suited for taxable investment accounts since their holdings change infrequently.An ETF may be indexed to the S P 500 (SNPINDEX), such as theMany ETFs are focused on specific industries, such as the4. Buy bonds and bond ETFs.You can also addA bond is a loan to a business or organization. Bondholders are entitled to collect interest payments during the bond's term and receive the bond's face value in a lump-sum payment at the end of the period. Although bonds are generally less risky than stocks, they also generate lower returns over the long term. The bonds with the highest yields are known as junk bonds and are issued by companies that are less financially stable than their peers.Another consideration when investing in bonds is that the interest payments from bonds can be taxed as income if you are using a taxable brokerage account. Exceptions include most municipal bonds which are bonds issued by local governments.Most bonds can only be purchased in $1,000 or $5,000 increments, which can make it difficult to diversify your bond holdings. For this reason, many investors instead opt to put their money in bond ETFs since they are more affordable and already diversified.5. Invest in REITs.While buying real estate is another great way to diversify your investment portfolio, owning property is not cheap. Even owning a few properties would not result in a diversified portfolio. For that reason, many investors may prefer to buy shares in real estate investment trusts (REITs).REITs are professionally managed portfolios of properties. Most REITs are organized around a real estate theme such as shopping malls or data centers. Because REITs are required to disburse to shareholders at least 90% of their taxable income, which is generated by rent and interest payments, REITs often pay higher dividends than most stocks. Their share prices can also appreciate in value as the price of real estate rises.Shares of REITs trade on stock exchanges just like shares of any public company. REITs can be especially appealing to income-focused investors, but it's important to realize that REIT payouts are typically taxed as ordinary income in taxable brokerage accounts.Remember to diversify your portfolioRegardless of how you choose to invest your $100,000, establishing a diversified portofolio is key to achieving your financial goals. No single company or investment should have an outsized place in your portfolio. Diversifying eliminates the risk of your portfolio's value changing dramatically if one company encounters misfortune. A diversified portfolio is also more likely to generate relatively consistent returns from year to year.A good range for how many stocks to own is 15 to 20. You can keep adding to your holdings and also invest in other types of assets such as bonds, REITs, and ETFs. The key is to conduct the necessary research on each investment to make sure you know what you are buying and why.Invest to minimize taxes and feesWhen putting your $100,000 to work, take care to minimize taxes and fees. Over long periods of time, expenses on your investments can significantly reduce your returns since every dollar subtracted from your portfolio is a dollar that is no longer earning compound interest.Consider using a tax-advantaged retirement account. Individual retirement accounts (IRAs), including traditional IRAs and Roth Iras, confer valuable tax savings. Contributions to traditional IRAs are often deductible from your tax bill, and withdrawals in retirement — when you may be in a lower tax bracket are taxed as ordinary income. Contributions to Roth IRAs are made with after-tax dollars, and withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.Other tax-advantaged options include 401 (k)Regardless of the type of retirement account, the earnings accumulated in the account are tax-deferred. And, in a taxable investment account, you are not obligated to pay taxes on gains until you sell the security (All investments bear some sort of expense. Be on the lookout for hidden fees, especially if you invest in annuities offered by insurance companies orA recap on how to invest $100,0001. Pay off high-interest debt.2. Establish an emergency fund.3. Begin your investing journey.Your specific investment goals and risk appetite predominantly determine how you should invest your money. Risk-averse investors or those nearing retirement may choose to invest more conservatively, while risk-seekers or younger investors may opt to buy mostly stocks.Once you establish your portfolio, remember to stay focused on your investment goals and the reasons why you invested in each security. Market volatility is inevitable, but that matters little if your original investment thesis remains unchanged.
