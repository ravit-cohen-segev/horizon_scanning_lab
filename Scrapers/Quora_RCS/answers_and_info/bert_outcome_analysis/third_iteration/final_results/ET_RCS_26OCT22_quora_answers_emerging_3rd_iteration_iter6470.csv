1,"Space ports?? Are you confusing wakanda for reality??The truth of the rift Valley in Africa speaks for itself. It goes further back than even the rotated hips and the expanded foreheads with weakened jaws. If you must use a fictional series to explain early humanity, I suggest “the croods” it's at least accurate as far as things like the volcanic activity, destruction of habitat, and the reduction of population, to near extinction.

Congress controls what little money there is in the US. They decided they had spent enough. There are always more worthwhile projects, other than space exploration, to use all of the available money.

If you mean building huge domed communities with names like Luna City and Selenegrad? I just don’t know.

We make things ‘replicable’, to a set standard.I work on a modern aircraft type. There are VERY few panels on this aircraft that are made specifically to fit.

Almost all are mass produced, and can be swapped between aircraft if needed. The Apollo machinery was almost ‘bespoke’. I’m sure things could be taken from one ‘airframe’ to another, but I would bet that there were differences in 99% of each one. That was how things were built in the 1950s/60s. For another analogy, how many modern cars have hand-beaten body panels? This was a specialist trade! How many ‘Panel Beaters’ survive today?The second is that the electronics (probably the one area that was had more commonality than anywhere else) was driven by valves and old school transistors. These are more able to deal with the effects of radiation than modern micro-circuitry. So therefore, we need to shield these better. Shielding adds weight.

8,"Technology has nothing to do with it. The moon is a dead, dried up ball of rubble. No water, no air, no plants, no animals. There is nothing of economic worth doing there. It would cost at least ten million dollars a year per person to support them, just keeping them alive. Not to mention a few billion up front to get them there.

9,"In 2010, my 14-year-old son asked me a similar question. I had a smartphone, an iPad, every member (5) in my home had a laptop and we had five flat TVs. Of course we had a good Wifi, cable TV, etc. I had told him before many things about ‘60s and ‘70s. At the beginning of the ‘70s we had only one TV in my family (of course black and white), in Spain we only had two TV channels, of course, we didn’t have computers, mobiles, etc.But after listening to his question, I told him one thing that made him frown.

When I was a kid, we could travel between Paris and New York in three hours and a half (if you had enough money to buy a ticket). You could take a Concorde at 9am in Paris and you could land in New York at 6:30 am local time, with a flight time duration of 3.30 hours. Today, if you want to fly to New York from Paris, the average duration of your flight would be 7.30 hours. Then I told him that the Concorde was designed in the 50s and 60s and her first flight was in March 1969. Here you can see a photo of this first flight:So in the XX century, there was a plane which needed less time to fly from Europe to America than another one in the XXI (at least until now).Then I showed him another airplanes that were designed in the ‘50s and ‘60s and began to fly in ‘60s-’70s:1.- A Boeing 747 the biggest airplane in history (passengers of course) until the arrival of Airbus A380:2.- An outstanding Blackbird; one of the fastest airplanes in history:3.- The Grumman F14:And Finally the superb Saturn V rocket -- the most powerful in history until the SLS begins to fly in the following years.So in the 1960s aeronautics and space engineering lived their golden era. Why? Because NASA had something more important than technology: political will and a lot of money to spend. If the same effort would have been maintained for 50 years, we would have had a Lunar Base, and another one in Mars already.",5 followers,Jake Williams,9.9K,3.2K,76.6M,2020,https://www.quora.com/If-humanity-evolved-in-Africa-first-then-where-are-the-space-ports-and-other-signs-of-technology-and-civilization

Conversely, if NASA were given 5% of the federal budget today, it could do far more than merely kick around a few sites on the moon.But we face different challenges today, and key among them is to develop the technology not merely to get to the moon and come right back, but to get to the moon and other places economically and sustainably. That is a much subtler and more complex challenge, one that NASA is currently handling intelligently, by sponsoring the commercial development of space launch services.","29,965 followers",Tomaž Vargazon,963,7.7K,249.9M,2019,https://www.quora.com/In-1969-was-the-technology-mature-enough-to-take-human-to-moon-and-bring-back-If-yes-why-had-the-technology-not-evolved-enough-in-50-years-to-colonize-moon
