4,"You might be heard about the Google glass which featured a bulky camera on one side and a rather odd chunk of display at the side.

It is designed to show very simple basic information in one of your eye. It can show you simple messages like directions or notifications. It works over Bluetooth with either an Android phone or an iPhone much in the same way your smartwatch does, taking commands from an app that runs in the background to control it. If there is any notification it can be read or dismissed using certain head gestures.It has little red monochrome projector. that shines an image on the holographic mirror which bounces it directly into the eyeball.Notification can only be seen if you are look down at the display. It does interfere with the standard line of vision.This was the technology which every college kids dreamt and now Intel has finally built it.﻿Thankyou","135,544 followers",Hector Quintanilla,582,1.2K,88.6M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-emerging-software-technology-trends-in-the-next-2-years
5,"Electric cars have existed for a very long time - in fact, the very earliest cars were more often electric than gasoline.Tesla have pushed that technology back into the public eye - and gotten it to the point where electric cars are actually a LOT better than gasoline cars.So I don’t think I’d call that “disruptive” so much as “evolutionary”.What I think *WILL* be disruptive is their Self-Driving technology.The nay-sayers continue to say that it’s never going to work…but as the AI gets better and better - the number of areas left to cover is shrinking RAPIDLY.The latest Tesla beta software - wElectric cars have existed for a very long time - in fact, the very earliest cars were more often electric than gasoline.Tesla have pushed that technology back into the public eye - and gotten it to the point where electric cars are actually a LOT better than gasoline cars.So I don’t think I’d call that “disruptive” so much as “evolutionary”.What I think *WILL* be disruptive is their Self-Driving technology.The nay-sayers continue to say that it’s never going to work…but as the AI gets better and better - the number of areas left to cover is shrinking RAPIDLY.The latest Tesla beta software - which is to be released to the general public around Xmas (2020) - is a gigantic leap forward. From the YouTube videos posted by the few people who are beta-testing it - it is EXTREMELY impressive.Based on what we’re seeing there - Tesla cars will be able to drive themselves everywhere by the middle of 2021 at the very latest.If/when the law then changes to allow cars to drive without human input - THAT will be the “tipping point”.ROBO-TAXI’S:For about the last year, Tesla have been warning people who lease a Tesla that they will not be given the opportunity to buy the car at the end of the lease.The reason for that is that Tesla are stockpiling used Tesla’s.Why would they do that?Tesla are also rapidly increasing the cost of the “Full Self Driving” option - it’s gone from $6,000 to $7,000 then $8,000 and now $10,000.Why would they do that?Every Tesla has a camera built into the rear-view mirror housing that is able to record everything that goes on inside the car. It’s currently disabled.Why would they do that?The answer is not a secret…Tesla are very open about why this is.They intend to launch an “Uber-like” taxi service - only without human drivers.So there would be Tesla cars scattered through cities that could be summoned to your location via cell phone - and which will drive you to your destination - just like an Uber or a taxi - but without a human driver.These cars will be able to self-recharge at special charging stations - and can basically drive 24/7 for a million miles without needing much in the way of servicing.Initially, private Tesla owners will be able to instruct their cars to go off and be a part of the RoboTaxi fleet when not needed for anything else.Elon suggests that $1/mile would be a reasonable fee - and that a Tesla could easily drive 35,000 miles/year as a RoboTaxi without limiting your ability to have your car ready for you when you need it.Since a low-end Model 3 costs not a whole lot more than $35,000 - the car could pay for itself in a year and then earn it’s owner $35,000 per year!That’s a GREAT deal for the owner - which is why Elon Musk has said that sooner or later, Tesla will stop selling cars altogether - and just use it’s manufacturing capacity to expand their RoboTaxi fleet.So…this explains why:They have also talked about a kit to allow you to remove the steering wheel and “gas” pedal when your car is self-driving.This also explains subtle new changes in recent software releases - for example, the ability to have a software lock on the glovebox that requires a specific combination to unlock it.(Rather handy for keeping tax and insurance paperwork locked inside the car while it’s a Taxi - but allowing access to it by police if the car has to be stopped for any reason.)CONCLUSION:Tesla believe that private car ownership will rapidly become a thing of the past once their RoboTaxi fleet is up and running.I’m not convinced that this will actually happen - but if it does, it’s hard to imagine a MORE disruptive technology!","24,639 followers",Terry Lambert,777,23.1K,77.3M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-emerging-software-technology-trends-in-the-next-2-years

The scientist makes the point that no nation will ever put you in a situation in which nuclear weapons have to be used. They would use “Salami Tactics” on you (Attacking you slice by slice).

Nuclear weapons are a LITERAL last step maneuver. Once launched, there is no going back. No nation on earth wants that attached to them. As a result, most of the military is now used to prevent this happening and to counter act each slice of the sausage.Let's take an example. The Ukraine. It joined NATO (It hasn’t. This is an example) and as a result has the full backing of all NATO countries. A fire goes off in one part of the Ukraine (We will say a smallish city closest to the Crimea). The Russian troops go over to help and help put out the fire. They stay there for a while and help to settle in the people after the massive fire. The troops stay there a little longer than needed. As a result the troops are now a regular scene on that city. As the soldier help everyone peoples feeling for them grow… And so on and so forth until the city become friendly to the Russian and as a result backs Russia. No violence needed. If the NATO Forces had boots on the ground and resources there, the slice would have been stopped. The troops were needed to stop the forces staying there in the first place. As a result the regular military is more needed , from NATO.The fact remains, in today's age, diplomacy is needed more than military might. Diplomacy at the right time is much better than a thousand soldiers at the wrong. Moving this on a little bit, the modern military now need to do MORE than they have ever needed. They have to be peacekeepers, publicity aware (I once heard a talk from a General who stated that today's general need to be able to work out a battle plan AND work out a marketing strategy). As a result of this need for versatility, the Army need to have more weapons and support. The nuclear age has added more need for army personnel and “unconventional tactics” as a result.Let's quickly see what would happen if full scale warfare was to break out. The first thing is that the world would hold its breath. Again no nations wants to launch first. If anything the special forces would be on high alert to take out any known (OR unknown) Nuclear silos. As a result, conventional warfare would still be centrepoint in order to counteract the need to wipe out the nuclear capability.","105,671 followers",Dave Consiglio,4.5K,6.8K,91.6M,2016,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-emerging-software-technology-trends-in-the-next-2-years

It led to people asking the same questions which we call myths. A myth is an attempt to explain certain questions about man's condition .which by the way are many the same questions we ask ourselves today . Some try and answer these questions through religion and others through science . You see at one time religion and science were one and the same but some where they split . The questions they ask are less then a dozen in number but are for example is there a creator? Do humans have a purpose? Why do the lights in the sky move? What happeneds when we die? I might point out that if you look at early man and early civilization and try and determine who the leaders and important characters were we find that they were the shamans the holy men they were the witch doctor and medicine man , the alchemists and the priest . These were the observers of the world. The ones who asked questions and frequently the ones that found discoveries.now then today it appears another split is under way. For example all to often scientist don't incorporate the facts and truth into their findings and reports, it no longer is science that they do. That would be called politic’s and politicians when they don't include the facts and truth into their reports and speeches they simply claim it is a science. Hmmmm logic seems to be a dying human characteristic as does science and I don't think we can be so lucky when it comes to the politicians and their branch of science. Their here to stay it would appear. Maybe it is our turn to be the observers of the world.","1,594 followers",Michael Van In,631,1.5K,2.9M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-emerging-software-technology-trends-in-the-next-2-years
