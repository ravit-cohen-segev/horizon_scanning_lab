He oversaw a company of scientists and engineers, and had them all working on various projects. He was quick to usher them all out when it was time for photo ops, so pictures of himself, hard at work in the lab, were what got distributed. And he was also very quick to put his name on things. But the notion of him as a lone genius was very much one that he created.Now, Edison was technically proficient, and certainly involved in his company’s research and development, but he certainly wasn’t dong it alone, and his primary skill was as a leader, rather than as an inventor. And, in that way, you could argue that Musk is a lot like Edison. You talk dismissively about “paying others for random projects”, but it’s not at all random. A big part of the skill that made Edison (and Musk) rich was the ability to figure out which projects have the potential to create transformative and marketable projects, to assemble and run the teams that develop those technologies, and then find ways to manufacture and market the products effectively. Those are vital and very difficult skills, and being able to do so consistently is something that few people could do (if everyone could do it, they wouldn’t be getting rich from it). No single person could invent all of those things from scratch, single-handed, but understanding the science involved is crucial to being able to make intelligent decisions.And, like Edison, Musk is a flawed individual, pursues questionable business practices, and can be kind of a dick. Being a brilliant business leader doesn’t imply that someone is a saint, or that they’re never wrong. (The absolute mess of Musk’s Twitter deal is embarrassing, but at least he didn’t murder any elephants). But what both of these men produced was transformative, and they deserve credit for making those things happen.","27,322 followers",Geoffrey Widdison,751,12.7K,106.8M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Why-was-Musk-elected-an-FRS-in-2018-when-he-s-an-entrepreneur-leveraging-known-technology-e-g-Edison-Ford-rather-than-a-scholar-doing-years-of-divergent-thinking-to-arrive-at-a-revolutionary-insight-about-the

One that is radicalizing space travel with the ultimate goal to land a human on Mars by 2025, and another that is going to forever change the automotive sector, one of the hardest industries to successfully enter and execute in.

One that is radicalizing space travel with the ultimate goal to land a human on Mars by 2025, and another that is going to forever change the automotive sector, one of the hardest industries to successfully enter and execute in. He is, through his ventures, slowly progressing humanity as a species towards a multi planetary and greener future. He is the very definition and epitome of what it means to “change the world.” SpaceX has claimed numerous historic feats of engineering with its drone ship landings and reusable rocket technology. And Tesla has consistently received worldwide recognition for their range and overall design appeal. Just to be CEO of either Tesla or SpaceX would be any entrepreneur’s dream. On the side he also is the Chair of SolarCity and the lead investor in Hyperloop. The former of which will slowly transition us from fossil fuels into a new age and the latter of which will connect the people of Earth through high speed transportation. Elon has consistently taken on the status quo in the world and changed it for the better. I have enormous respect for him.All of that being said, Albert Einstein was a God amongst men and women.In what is known as his “miracle year” in 1905, Einstein published FOUR papers that would change Physics and all of natural science and engineering forever. Producing just one of those papers through one’s life would make the career of any other Physicist. All of this while he was spending his time daydreaming in a patent office! While revered professors like Max Planck were busy trying to postulate theories like he did. Oh, I didn’t mention this was all done when Einstein was 26 years old. Just being able to imagine the concepts of special relativity and brownian motion were astounding feats of the human mind. A decade later, Einstein published the General Theory of Relativity. If I were to be asked by an alien civilization to hand over our most impressive work from all history in order to impress them, it would be this paper. The General Theory defines what the human mind is capable of if utilized to the fullest. It was a game changer no one had considered and very likely wouldn't have if not for Einstein. Albert Einstein replaced Newton on the pedestal for genius with that paper. The Newton verse was replaced by the idea of space-time as a fabric that can be bent. All of Einstein’s theories would later appear in revolutionary technologies (GPS to name one) all the way through to the most recent discovery of gravitational waves.Elon Musk is changing the world for humanity. Albert Einstein redefined the universe for humanity.Elon Musk could prove me wrong with the rest of his ventures in life. Depending on where his companies go, he could get very near Einstein’s level of reverence.

There are plenty of inventions that are incorrectly attributed to Edison because he took the patents out on them. This is because Edison had the world’s first integrated research laboratory where the best and brightest specialists in their fields were brought together to work on a problem as a team, not isolated individuals as was previously the norm.Nikola Tesla was an isolated genius who could intuitively design new inventions despite not being greatly talented in mathematics. He was altruistic and a poor businessman, which rather explains why he died in reduced circumstances, and he also declined much in later life, falling prey to unsubstantiated fantasy and wild ideas (the incident where he literally fell in love with a pigeon rather sums it up).The world owes Tesla a great debt of thanks to his breakthroughs in induction motors, transformers, power transmission and other crucial elements of modern technology, but the man was fundamentally unstable.Edison was undoubtedly an arsehole, and treated Tesla terribly, but he ushered in the modern age of big science, and the pragmatic part of Musk recognises this and admires it despite the individuals character flaws.",3 followers,Steve Baker,725,27.4K,163.3M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Why-was-Musk-elected-an-FRS-in-2018-when-he-s-an-entrepreneur-leveraging-known-technology-e-g-Edison-Ford-rather-than-a-scholar-doing-years-of-divergent-thinking-to-arrive-at-a-revolutionary-insight-about-the

Revolution in Germany, Spain and China was betrayed, paid for in blood by revolutionaries, and paradoxically further strengthened the grip of the conservative Stalinists.
