I was only 5 years old. All I cared about was video games.But one day we went to a garage sale and there was this amazing CB radio with a police station mic on it.Oh man… This CB radio was made out of black leather with a 4ft antenna, it had a really nice microphone, with shiny silver knobs, and a battery backup unit installed. When I laid my eyes on it, I knew I had to have it.The problem was…. I was a kid, so I had no money.The radio was on sale for only $20. So, I thought that it wouldn’t be hard to convince my father to buy it.Unfortunately, my father was not willing to make it an easy task for me.After I asked for the $20, he walked back to the car with me and told me to seat down with him. He smiled, looked me in the eyes and said:“Here’s 5 dollars. Go get that radio”.I, of course, made an interrogation face and complained about it:“Dad… that radio costs 20 dollars, not 5.”He smiled again and answered back:“Well, if you really want it…. you will find a way to persuade the lady to sell it for $5.”I was still not convinced, so I tried my last shot:“Dad… $20 is already a good price. She will never accept that.”Which he promptly replied:“Ok, if you’re so sure that it can’t be done, then let’s forget about it.”I was confused, but I still didn’t want to give up. So, I asked him:“How can I do that?”“Just smile at the lady, tell her that's all you have and show how much you want it. If she says “no”, at least you tried.”I remember it like it was yesterday… I walked up drive way slowly thinking about my approach, very scared and worried.I stared at the radio for a few minutes until the lady walked up, and I realized that this was my chance.There was a long moment of silence.Then I looked at her and noticed that she was wearing the same dress that my mom bought a few weeks ago. I smiled and pointed to her dress:“My mom has one of this. It’s her current favorite. You both have a very good taste.”“Ow, that’s a very sweet.” She smiled back and said: “How can I help this little gentleman?”Here was my opportunity. And I took it:“Look, I am in love with this radio. The good news is that I convinced my dad to give me $5 dollars. The bad news is that I need other $15. Is there anything I can do to get it at a better price?”She couldn’t resist my approach. Right away she picked the radio, went behind the cash machine and winked at me:“This is going to be our secret, ok little boy?” “I am going to make it for $5 for you. But you can’t tell this to anybody”.Here I was… 5 years old and having my first negotiation experience. My body was flooded of adrenaline.That lesson was critical for the rest of my life.Later on, when I got my first job as a dishwasher for a local restaurant, I looked for opportunities to help me get a better job. While I was working as a dishwasher, I helped the owners to create a better system for the whole restaurant, improving their daily routines and schedules.This, of course, allowed me to negotiate a better position and salary in that restaurant.In the end, the key lesson I’ve learned from that early experience is that the hardest part of salesAnd that you have to always believe in yourself.Here’s a pic of the man who raised me and taught me this important lesson:",0 followers,Tommy Mello,699,136,3.5M,2016,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-skills-sets-one-should-acquire-to-become-an-emerging-market-technology-investment-specialist

I know a transmission5G will first be used in the same LTE band - no change in frequencies there, it will just blink and blip in a different digital “language.” That’s 600 MHz to 6 GHz - all stuff we already have.
