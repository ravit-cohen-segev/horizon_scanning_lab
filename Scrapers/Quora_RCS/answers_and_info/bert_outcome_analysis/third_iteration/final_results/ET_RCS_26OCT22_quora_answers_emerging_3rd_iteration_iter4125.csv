It is also highly secure: when a transaction occurs, instead of being recorded on a single, centralised ledger, it instantly appears on a vast network of computers. Although public, it can only be used with a specific “key”. When accessed, an immutable trail is left behind. In other words, blockchain technology eliminates the need for a trusted third party to verify that a transaction has taken place.The financial sector—from major banks such as UBS and Deutsche Bank to the Nasdaq stock exchange—A blockchain essentially acts as a public database on which transactions are permanently recorded. It is also highly secure: when a transaction occurs, instead of being recorded on a single, centralised ledger, it instantly appears on a vast network of computers. Although public, it can only be used with a specific “key”. When accessed, an immutable trail is left behind. In other words, blockchain technology eliminates the need for a trusted third party to verify that a transaction has taken place.The financial sector—from major banks such as UBS and Deutsche Bank to the Nasdaq stock exchange—has been quick to adopt the nascent technology, largely for its capacity to radically drop transaction costs. But other sectors are seeing the potential too. “Every aspect of our economy is adopting certain parts of blockchain and is looking at how to use it,” says Judith Pearson, the president of the Breckenridge Private Asset Management Group and the co-founder of Aris, a leading art title insurer.In the art world, blockchain technology may hold the key to overcoming one of its greatest challenges: the lack of transparency. Frequently described as the last unregulated market, the art world often operates on trust alone. But this trust keeps being tested, as recent forgery scandals such as the Knoedler Gallery fiasco and the case of German forger Wolfgang Beltracchi show.“The art market has flourished because of the lack of transactional standards and transparency,” Pearson says. A networked digital ledger such as a blockchain could help keep track of a work of art’s movements without relying on a paper-based—and at times insecure—system of recording provenance. But this would require the trade to adopt the new technology, which it may be slow to do.Leading the wayUnsurprisingly, the first forays into the art trade’s use of blockchain have been made by start-ups. Ascribe, for example, offers artists a platform for uploading their digital works, securing their attribution and selling them. Masha McConaghy, the co-founder of Ascribe and a former curator, says that the company’s aim is to overcome the hurdles of collecting digital art. “The value of a work is based on its provenance, but how do you track the provenance of a digital work that can be copied for free, millions of times, and spread throughout the world?” Ascribe, which she describes as “potentially game-changing”, is currently being used by more than 5,000 artists and “dozens of organisations” (in 2015, the Museum of Applied Arts in Vienna acquired several editions by the artist Harm van den Dorpel that had been authenticated by Ascribe).Access to allMeanwhile, the Silicon Valley-based start-up Blockai is trying to democratise access to copyright protection. The platform allows artists to claim copyright on their work instantaneously and shows them where it is being used. Blockai also acts as a fraud deterrent. “If someone tries to claim somebody else’s work, there will be a permanent record that you can’t put through a paper shredder or hit delete on,” says Nathan Lands, Blockai’s chief executive officer.Other art-related blockchain companies include Verisart, founded by Robert Norton, the former chief executive officer of Sedition and Saatchi Online, which assigns certificates of authenticity to works of art. Norton and McConaghy are participating in a panel discussion at the Frankfurt Book Fair on 19 October titled Blockchain, Bitcoin & Co: the New Currencies of the Arts. The art pricing database Artprice also launched a blockchain project in May.",289 followers,Deepak Mehta,4K,3.9K,105.3M,2021,https://www.quora.com/How-could-the-revolutionary-technology-behind-Bitcoin-change-the-art-market

(Photo: REUTERS/Edgar Su)SINGAPORE: We see increasing interest in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as the price of Bitcoin rallied and crashed, showing an almost ten-fold increase in price over a one-year period.Bitcoin is to date the highest valued or most expensive cryptocurrency in the world having grown by 276 per cent in the last year alone, well ahead of others such as Ether used on the Ethereum network.It peaked in April this year before crashing to almost half its value in June. Singapore investors, too, are keeping a sharp eye on Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, with traditional institutions such as banks starting blockchain funds to give their high-net-worth investors the opportunity to invest in cryptocurrencies.We even see traditional businesses like Kopitiam in Funan announcing that they will be accepting cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. As of January, there were eight Bitcoin ATMs in Singapore, and about 51 businesses listed as accepting cryptocurrencies for payment, according to Statista.Now is the time to invest your cryptocurrency in reliable platforms that does not have any issue with crypto price fluctuations where you get ROIs on your invested crypto regardless of what the price is. Investing in cryptocurrency in general is a good business if you are on the right path and with the right platform. After so many failed attempt on getting the right platform, I came across Libraforex Cryptocurrency Investment Platform (www.libraforex,io) where i get different percentages on every investment i made with cryptocurrency every 10 days. It looks too good to be true until i gave it a try and trust me it has been a smooth ride all the way. Don’t give up on cryptocurrency and join the platform. Trust me, you won’t care about the price fluctuation anymore. Thank me Later.PS: This is not in any case of me trying to lure you into anything for my own personal financial gain, i am just innocently sharing so that you could gain one or two things as this has been working for me. You can also make a research on what works for you tooBITCOIN AS A TRANSACTIONAL CURRENCYBitcoin, however, has several characteristics that make it unsuitable for use as a transactional currency.AdvertisementThe volatility of Bitcoin suggests that both consumers and merchants bear exchange-rate risk, which arises from the need to change fiat currency to Bitcoin.For instance, in 2010 we saw the first ever commercial transaction using Bitcoin to purchase a pair of pizzas for 10,000 Bitcoins – what is said to equate to about US$40 then would cost almost US$400 million today.People use a smartphone app to pay bills, buy groceries or have their hair cut with bitcoin, making a direct online transfer to the vendor AFP/Stanley ESTRADAThe inefficiency of blockchain with transactions taking hours, even days, to be confirmed, and the use of proof of work in Bitcoin mining also results in excessive electricity use, leading to sustainability issues.So, it is unlikely that Bitcoin will see widespread adoption locally as a currency for transactions, although other forms of virtual currencies or stable coins with values pegged to certain fiat currencies may see wider adoption as a currency for transactions.Further, there are limited regulatory protections for the customers of cryptocurrencies, which mean that unlike e-money stored in an EZ-Link card or in a bank account, should the company become insolvent, the customers of cryptocurrencies may well lose the entire amount.In this regard, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has required cryptocurrency firms to make clear and appropriate disclosures to their customers, including merchants, so that all customers are aware of the risks.This service is not intended for persons residing in the EU.

Instead, they are considered goods, just like collectors’ cards which people can buy from vending machines or shops. And as a good, they can be used as a medium of exchange.BITCOIN AS AN INVESTMENT INSTRUMENTBut with high-net-worth investors increasingly interested in incorporating cryptocurrencies into their investment portfolio and mainstream banks such as DBS offering investment opportunities to clients featuring cryptocurrencies as part of the portfolio, we are likely to see increasing interest amongst local investors in cryptocurrencies given its increased availability from banks.It should be noted however that the size of the cryptocurrency market in Singapore remains extremely small, according to the MAS. Over the years, the MAS has repeatedly issued consumer advisories to warn the public of the risks of trading or investing in cryptocurrencies.A Bitcoin automated machine (ATM) is seen at Hong Lim Complex in Singapore February 7, 2018. Picture taken February 7, 2018. REUTERS/Dewey SimThe prices of cryptocurrencies can be highly volatile and are often speculative in nature. This is not surprising given that factually and scientifically, cryptocurrencies are nothing more than bytes of data sitting on computers in networks.They are not pegged to any nation’s economy or economic fundamentals and their value cannot be objectively measured or ascertained. Their values are simply what people think they are worth, very much like collectible cards, and even fluctuating according to the tweets of billionaires like Elon Musk.The massive quick increases in value are attractive to those hoping to make fast profits – investors are always hopeful that they can buy at the trough and sell at the peak, especially since the rise and fall cycles occur frequently and rapidly.RULES AGAINST MISUSEIn addition to warning consumers of the speculative nature of many of these virtual assets, the MAS has imposed rules to combat the misuse of cryptocurrencies to finance terrorism and weapons proliferation, and money laundering such as laundering proceeds from drug trafficking and the use of cryptocurrencies to receive ransom or other illicit payments.The ability of cryptocurrencies to be moved or used quickly, relatively anonymously and the cross-border nature of such transactions means that they are ideal mechanisms for money laundering.Further, cryptocurrency assets stolen from cryptocurrency firms with poor governance or cybersecurity measures can be laundered unnoticed either through other firms with equally poor governance or cybersecurity measures or through DeFi - decentralised finance systems - which has no intermediaries for transactions.REGULATION FOR PROVIDERSIn Singapore, entities offering the trading of cryptocurrencies are regulated as digital payment token service providers under the Payment Services Act and need to be licensed.Similarly, entities that deal in cryptocurrencies or facilitate the transmission of cryptocurrencies or provide custodian wallet services also need to be licensed and comply with all the requirements.A cryptocurrency ATM at The Arcade in Raffles Place Singapore (Photo: Jeremy Long)Although the regulatory intent is to address money laundering and terrorism financing risks, the requirements on the entities are fairly substantial, which may in turn disincentivise firms from offering the services widely.For example, prior to any transaction, rigorous customer due diligence is required, coupled with constant and continuous monitoring.",2 followers,Kelly Pearson,1.7K,0,0,2021,https://www.quora.com/How-could-the-revolutionary-technology-behind-Bitcoin-change-the-art-market
