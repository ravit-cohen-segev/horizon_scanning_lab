You may find the following stuff extremely disturbing!It all boils to the fact that human beings are biological creatures and the biological evolution statesThe observation is thatTL;DR: Religious people breed. Atheists do not breed. The future does not belong to the brightest, but to the frummest.Moreover, on Donella Meadows’ control theorem ofThis is the reason why KGB and Soviet Union considered spreading Atheism and anti-religioius work so important. As long as the Western world had sound religious and spiritual basis, it was immune to Communist subversion. Conversely, the people most eager to adopt Communism and Communist agenda were Atheists. Destruction of religion was an essential step on getting the Western societies to prone to collapse and conquest. This is something the Westerners never understood - and never will.Religion is the very basis where societies are foundedTL;DR; Society does not create a religion. Religion creates a society.And this all is due toMemes are the information carrier units in the cultural evolution like genes are in the biological. Together they form meme systems, memeplexes (analogous to organisms). And the very same concepts of ecology, struggle of existence, survival of the fittest, ecosystems and ecological niches apply. And religion is a memeplexReligions are not “viruses of mind”, like Richard Dawkins suggested, but they are fundamental memeplexes, as Susan Blackmore has suggested.Religions are there because there is an ecological niche. Like in biological evolution, you can exterminate the occupants of an ecological niche, but it sure will get re-occupied. An empty ecological niche is an unnatural state.Atheism represents an empty ecological niche.And an ecological niche which is vacated is sure to get occupied. In a case of a religion, if not by a sensible religion, then by one which is completely nuts.Remember when I said the question is not about who is right but who is left? This applies verbatim to cultural evolution. The question is not of which meme or memeplex is materially correct, but which can propagate itself most vigorously. This is the reason why I studied astrology as a teen: to make me more popular among other girls. IAnd this also meansAnd religions do not propagate by conversion, but by breeding.And no, it is not about prohibiting abortion or contraception. It is thatThis is the same in all religions - not Christianity only. Religiosity and fecundity go hand in hand. Which means the Viljanen genes are very likely to survive in the biological evolution and struggle of existence, unless a genocide occurs.This is also the reason why Europe is facing a societal disaster. Atheism is nothing new in history, and it is tightly linked with anacyclosis. Atheism is a phenomenon which emerges at the last stage of anacyclosis, before the societal collapse or upheaval; it means the society has turned from democracy into ochlocracy. It means people, having lost faith in the supernatural, have lost the faith in the future - and on themselves.And each time, the result has been re-emergence of religion. Not necessarily the same as before the collapse.Europe is heading to demographic catastrophe and collapse. It will be seen which religion will emerge as the victor and which will occupy the empty memetic ecological niche. I wish it will happen only when I’m dead and I won’t be seeing it, and I wish it will not be Islam.Can science occupy the same ecological niche? No.Why there has never been a religionless society? Why there never will be? The reason is that the religion memeplex is not about being right. It is about being left. Religion is not for individuals; it is for societies. Religion is the mortar which binds the individual human bricks of the society into a stout brick wall. Remove it, and all you have is a heap of bricks which will collapse at slightest push. This is the reason why all non-religious ideal societies have collapsed at third generation latest - and why religious ideal societies can last for millennia. Monte Cassino monastery had been founded 529 AD, and Heian 711.And this is the reason why religion is there and always will remain there.TL;DR; Religions are memeplexes and there are ecological niches for them.
