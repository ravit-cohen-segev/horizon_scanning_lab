2,"1. Translator earbudsGoogle’s Pixel Buds pair with the Pixel smartphone and use Google Translate to translate languages in real time. This invention could remove language barriers and make travelling - and doing business with other cultures – much easier. With these earbuds, someone could be standing in front of you speaking French, and the earbuds will feed you the English translation. You can then hold down your right earbud and speak in English, and your phone will project the French translation from the Pixel's speaker, so the other person can hear.

3,"Well, let’s think about it for a bit.What kind of technologies have been invented in the last century?We have things like radar, and microwave, and the internet, and satellites and computer chips, and nuclear power, and canned food, and drones, and aviation technology, and GPS, and infant formula, and indexing of websites for search engines, and bar codes, and touch screens, and vaccines, and windpower, and the accelerometer, and fire resistant clothing, and aerodynamic trucks, airbags, miniature cameras that fit in a webcam or cellphone, weather forecasting, and submarines, cellular technologWell, let’s think about it for a bit.What kind of technologies have been invented in the last century?We have things like radar, and microwave, and the internet, and satellites and computer chips, and nuclear power, and canned food, and drones, and aviation technology, and GPS, and infant formula, and indexing of websites for search engines, and bar codes, and touch screens, and vaccines, and windpower, and the accelerometer, and fire resistant clothing, and aerodynamic trucks, airbags, miniature cameras that fit in a webcam or cellphone, weather forecasting, and submarines, cellular technology and networks, RAM memory, hard disk drives, liquid-crystal displays, lithium batteries, so on.But all that kind of stuff was developed by having governments getting involved, funding research and science and so on.Which, as we all know, is a really inefficient method, it pretty much doesn’t work.Instead of this inefficient method that clearly doesn’t work, of having governments take part in research and development, we now have a much better strategy for innovation:Random guys in their garage!As we all know, that’s where all the true innovation comes from, random middle class dudes, who have ideas, and then do a startup in their garage.Either that, or huge corporations who invest in ways to extend their patents.So now, we have much more groundbreaking innovation.We have things like Amazon, who patented and made a fortune off one-click buying, the truly revolutionary idea of not making people click more than needed.Do you really think that government could have ever come up with a brilliant idea like that, huh?","68,766 followers",Kanthaswamy Balasubramaniam,898,17.3K,413.3M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-places-where-advanced-technology-is-actually-used
