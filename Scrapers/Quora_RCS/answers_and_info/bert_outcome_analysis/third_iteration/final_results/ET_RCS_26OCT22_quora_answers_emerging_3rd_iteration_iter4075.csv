Unfortunately, the glyphs depict a giant lightbulb which explains why the tombs weren't covered in soot but it's impossible to know which was invented first. The lightbulb or the telephone/telegraph. But it could be as old as 4,000 years.","9,587 followers",Max Searle,2.1K,82,6.7M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-first-technology-ever-invented-in-the-history-of-world-technology-recorded

They created the Star Forge, a device that can create fleets and droid armies out of matter from a nearby star, and relied on Dark Side energy. Only way to get there was using Star Maps, dark side devices that only people powerful in the darkside could read. Also, the Infinite Engine, able to even create galaxies given enough time.

They could also be used to create Infinity Waves, used to destroy entire planets and surrounding areas, which were in Star Temples and Star Gates. The Gree also created Hypergates, which were around the same thing, only a bit more primitive and couldn’t be used as a superweapon.

They can also use Centerpoint to destroy worlds, solar systems, and even the galaxy.Date of establishment: around 100,000 BBYWell, why is that, you may ask? It’s simple. Technology over time is lost, the creators die, the empires fall, and eventually, the way to make the technology is forgotten, and the technology itself is destroyed over a period of war. This applies throughout time. The reason why technology never progresses through this time period, is that technology during this period, while it does become more progressive, doesn’t scratch the surface of the technology they had thousands of years before.",0 followers,Solomon Lee,663,314,5.9M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-first-technology-ever-invented-in-the-history-of-world-technology-recorded

During the course of the saga we have seen some remarkably advanced droids over the years. Some memorable ones that stand out, thanks to their unique programming, include….Kalani was a one of a kind, like most of these unique droids. Manufactured to be a Super Tactical droid, to serve and command Separatist forces during the Clone Wars, his knowledge of tactics and war strategies were second to only a few. He was also one of the most intelligent droids ever produced by the CIS.We also have C-21 Highsinger, who served as a bounty hunter allegiant to a young Boba Fett during the Clone Wars. Deadly efficient with firearms of all types, Highsingers combat programming allowed it to spin from the waist up, allowing him to target multiple individuals in a devastating, pre-calculated strike.Another example of droid evolution is that of IG-88. Killing his original masters, so as to be free amongst the galaxy to do as he pleased, this assassin droid went on to have a very lucrative career as a bounty hunter during the reign of the Empire. He even at one point, albeit very briefly, took over the second Death Star before his plans were shattered by the Rebels.The list goes on and on with brilliantly programmed, and fascinating droids that were more than a step above your run of the mill ones. To name but a few, and without getting into detail, we have…K-2SO,4-LOM, and…The BX-Series Commando droid.All of the aforementioned droids are quite advanced for their times, and each display brilliant use of droid technological evolution, but there is one droid that far surpasses these clunking, outdated, antiquated relics.I introduce to you…,Guri.Created in the year 7 BBY in the Minos Cluster, by Imperial Research scientists Simonelle and Massad Thrumble, Guri was a Fourth degree human replica droid.And the only one of her kind to be programmed as an assassin.The Empire had begun researching into human replica droids, being led by the aforenamed Imperial scientists. Eventually they came up with a prototype for the Emperors requests, and named it 'Project Decoy'. Needless to say, the Empire aborted the project, and the Thrumble's had to turn elsewhere.Meeting ‘Black Sun' leader, and Imperial hardware supplier, Prince Xixor, would seal the deal for them and Xixor quickly commissioned a human replica droid be built to serve as his top liutenant. Being a crime lord he was very paranoid by nature, and believed this new droid would be more loyal to him than any sentient being ever could.They sold her to him for nine million credits, and Xixor believed that every credit was very well spent.She may have resembled a young woman in her 20’s, but don't let that fool you. Besides her superior programming, that allowed her to understand as many alien languages as C-3PO, Guri was tremendously strong. She could pick two huge men up by their throats, and send them hurtling across the air simultaneously. She was proficient not only with all manner and make of firearms, but deadly at multiple forms of martial arts and other combat disciplines that were a part of her programming. The only real way to tell her apart from a real human was her body temperature. It was 10 degrees cooler than a standard human, making her dead if she was real.Xixor used her to conduct the daily operations of his crime syndicate, and even take out his opposition and threats. She was even responsible for killing Ubese Bounty Hunter and former Black Sun member, Boussh at her dark masters command.Guri was the perfect example in droid evolution and was immensely superior to other droids in the same degree or class. The reason why most never saw her amazingly sophisticated droid technology was because she was commissioned by the rich and infamous, and remained unique and a one of a kind. The advanced droid technology was there in the SWU, but was never mass produced or prominently featured in society. It was only accessible by the rich, greedy and corrupt beings of the galaxy.","2,094 followers",John Bambrook,1.4K,1.2K,23.9M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-first-technology-ever-invented-in-the-history-of-world-technology-recorded

She described the drowning sensation as being in a spinning dryer — observing many tunnels underwater, with lights at the receiving end, shining in the distance but with no escape.In an interview, she says,About 15 meters away she could see her eldest son Lucas. She swam across the current, grabbed Lucas and held onto a tree trunk until they found themselves in a swamp.She screamed for her husband and two younger sons but heard no response.Not for one second did she believe that her husband and two other boys were alive.She was wrong…Her husband pummeled in the wave and lost sight of his sons. After holding onto a tree for thirty minutes, he heard “Papa! Mama! Lucas! Simon”.Quique was reunited with his son, who was perched on a branch.They then heard little Simon!Convinced that his wife and Lucas were dead, Quique remained hopeful and made the decision of leaving his two sons with a stranger. Whilst teaming up with another grieving husband, the pair searched through hospitals full of wounded and dying people.He found his injured wife, who miraculously survived, alongside Lucas.The two sons also made their way to the hospital and the family were reunited!The movieWhat’s the take-away message?

KillinWe stand by Palestine from all over the worldThe actual sequence of events:1) Israeli occupation/ apartheid violence against Palestinians2)Israel continues to escalate through forced expulsions, illegal settlements, beatings, prisoning and ethnic cleansing of Palestinians3)Injured helpless Palestinians defend themselves desperately by “throwing rocks” (250 were injured on Saturday while praying in the mosque)*The world remains silent!*4) So some respond and fight back with “violence” using primitive tools5) Israel with fully loaded forces (supported by US tax $) responds with massacres! Killing children and families within seconds (500injured; 160 killed of which 10 as of now)If you start reporting at #4 you are misleading people.Nothing about this is self defense",1 follower,Mr Unknown,3.1K,0,0,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-pictures-without-text-with-deep-meaning-s
