William Lavigne and Timothy Dumas were found dead at a training site on Fort Bragg, North Carolina. The case is being investigated as a homicide. Lavigne was a member of the Army's elite counter-terrorism unit, Delta Force, and deployed to Afghanistan and Iraq.Master Sargent William LavigneDumas was an Army veteran who previously served as the property book officer at 7th Special Forces Group before serving in the same role at Fort Bragg for nine years.Timothy DumasFort Bragg has said foul play is suspected in their deaths and it is being investigated as a homicide, although no weapon was found on the scene. The 2 men were found dead around 3:30 p.m. Dec. 2 in a wooded training area of Fort Bragg, near Manchester Road.A hunter out for a deer was on federal reservation property adjacent to the sprawling Army base of Ft. Bragg, North Carolina. He had only driven his truck about half a mile up the soft dirt track road in the area between the Holland Drop Zone and Lake MacArthur when he found his path blocked by a gray late-model, crew-cab pickup truck. The vehicle appeared to have been stuck in the soft sand up to its rear axle. Exiting his vehicle he immediately noticed the shape of a body lying in the pine straw about 30ft away from the truck. It was a black male in his late 30s, wearing civilian clothes. He had a small puncture wound on the right side of his head near the temple. The hunter contacted 911 and told them someone had been injured while trying to free his vehicle from the sand and may have had a heart attack.The hunter had stumbled onto the remains of some type of firefight between a group of people. The deceased man lying face down in the pine straw was Timothy J. Dumas, 44, an Army Warrant Officer of 19 years service. He had died of an apparent gunshot wound to the head by what is currently believed to have been a small-caliber handgun. An inspection of the gray pickup truck revealed the body of a second man curled into a fetal position, clothed only in a pair of boxer shorts and covered by an army-issue, insulated poncho liner. His body bore multiple gunshot wounds to the torso. Blood was leaking under the closed tailgate and onto the ground below it. According to a source who spoke toThe death certificates indicated that Lavigne died of multiple gunshot wounds; Dumas died of bullets to the chest and head. A high ranking defense official told the Washington Post however, that the preliminary evidence in the homicide case indicates the men may have been involved in criminal activity before they died. Court records show that both Lavigne and Dumas, a former chief warrant officer who worked as a property accounting technician at Fort Bragg from November 1996 to March 2016, had pending court dates in unrelated cases at the time of their slayings. Lavigne was due in Cumberland County District Court in connection with a hit-and-run charge from February 2020. In Dumas’ case, he had a Dec. 17 court date in Forsyth County on charges of breaking and entering, communicating threats and impersonating a law enforcement officer. Lavigne and Dumas were the subjects of a larger investigation involving the distribution of narcotics. The residence of MSG Lavigne appears to be unknown at this time even to Army investigators. The record of MSG Lavigne when the media investigated seemed to be wiped clean almost to the point that he had never existed at all.Lavigne was previously investigated in the 2018 death of his friend and fellow special forces operator Sgt. First Class Mark Leshikar. Lavigne fatally shot Leshikar in front of his five-year-old daughter. He claimed that Leshikar was acting 'paranoid' and had threatened him in his own home with a screwdriver. No screwdriver was found at the scene in the home and Lavigne's accounts of the shooting showed inconsistencies. A screwdriver was located outside by the vehicle Leshikar had been working on before the shooting. A special force investigation wrote that Lavigne was not credible yet Leshikar was still found to have died in the line of duty. Local Police and the Army Criminal Investigation Command deemed that Leshikar's death was a 'justifiable homicide'Lavigne and Sgt. First Class Mark Leshikar were best friends. Leshikar was a member of 19th Special Forces Group and had previously deployed to Afghanistan and Tajikistan. He was also suffering from a traumatic brain injury due to an improvised explosive device detonating near him, which was why he was assigned to a desk job at Fort Bragg. Because of his traumatic brain injury, Leshikar was prescribed Tramadol which he became addicted to, his family said. He would also self medicate with Valium. Leshikar and Lavigne were also known to use cocaine. From March 15 to 19, Leshikar and Lavigne were on vacation together with their families at Disney World in Florida. According to Lavigne's statement to police, Leshikar began acting irrationally on the car ride back to Fayetteville, North Carolina. In his statement to police later that day he said that Leshikar was acting “paranoid” and believed that they were being followed, and that their conversation was being listened to by a third party. However, documents say that Leshikar's wife Laura spoke with him that day and he sounded lucid to her.Sgt. First Class Mark LeshikarOn the afternoon of March 21, 2018 they arrived at Lavigne's home in the 1300 block of Anhinga Court in Fayetteville. It is the last house in a quiet cul-de-sac on the backside of a neighborhood about 20 minutes away from Fort Bragg. Leshikar began working on his car out in the driveway.Home on Anhinga Court in Fayetteville where Leshikar died in 2018Lavigne later said in a statement to police he was removing the car's battery. During this time, the two allegedly had an argument which then turned into a physical confrontation. It turned into some sort of wrestling match, but what the argument was about remains unclear. Lavigne then went into the home, and locked himself inside with both of their daughters, who were around five years old at the time. Leshikar's daughter said that William or “Uncle Billy” was scaring her, and she unlocked the door for her father to enter.Sgt. First Class Mark Leshikar with 5 year old daughterWhat happened next remains disputed by the family members of both men, but the medical examiner's report reveals some details. Leshikar was found by police officers and the medical examiner in a prone position with multiple gunshot wounds to his chest and neck. Four .45-caliber shell casings were found at the scene. Three of four gunshots struck Leshikar, according to the ME report. One penetrated his neck and lodged in his back. Another struck hit him in his right side. The third was a superficial grazing wound across the left side of his neck, the bullet arching at a 45-degree downward angle, the bullet passing from back to front. Bullet fragments were present underneath the carpet showed Lavinge shot Leshiker in the back while he was laying down on the floor after being shot from previous bullets fired by Lavinge. The bullet fragment found under the carpet showed that Leshikar was executed because it showed Leshikar was shot laying down when he already had been previously shot. Lavigne made sure by that shot Leshikar would die. Three hits from a .45-caliber bullet at close range by a man trained to use guns makes me believe these were kill shots.Lavinge's statement to law enforcement at the scene was that Leshikar had attacked him with a screw driver. An Army memorandum states that Lavigne first alleged that Leshikar had killed himself, but then changed his account of what happened. “At the time the body was rolled no screw driver was found,” the Medical Examiner's report states.A Defense Department memorandum based on the Cumberland County Sheriff's report revealed additional inconsistencies. Law enforcement later told Leshikar's family that they had found a screw driver, not at the scene of his death, but outside near his car where he had been removing the battery. Lavigne was never administered a toxicology screen to test him for alcohol or narcotics in his system following the shooting. A sergeant with the Cumberland County Homicide Unit investigated the death, said Lt. Sean Swainn, a spokesman for the county sheriff’s office. An incident report on the sheriff’s website lists it as a justifiable homicide, but in response to an email seeking further details, Swainn offered little more information and directed the media to a statement the sheriff issued the day after the shooting, which said no charges had been filed. It is fairly obvious that the investigation ignored the fact that Lavigne lied initially in claiming Leshikar committed suicide. It also ignored the screwdriver issue which was the weapon Lavigne claimed Leshikar allegedly used to justify the homicide. Simply stated the screwdriver was not found by the body of Lavigne which means to me that everything Lavigne claimed was untruthful.Mark LeshikarPersonally I do not believe that Leshikar would have entered the home with a screwdriver to use as a weapon because his 5 year old daughter was inside. Leshikar was in tip top physical condition and could have easily entered the home had his daughter not opened the door for him. Leshikar made no attempt to break in the home despite Lavigne locking the door with Leshikar’s 5 year old daughter inside. The fact that the screwdriver was located outside the home by the car and not by Leshikar’s body inside the home obliterates Lavigne’s account of how Leshikar was killed.""The shooter's own words bury his ass because there is no screw driver. Did it disappear or melt? Someone tampered with the crime scene or he's lying,"" said Paul Ciolino, president of the International Association of Forensic Criminologists, after reviewing documents from the case. As a criminal profiler, Ciolino has investigated and exonerated death row inmates. The memorandum from 1st Special Forces Command written by an investigating officer appointed by the command, concluded that Lavigne was not credible. 1st Special Forces Command ruled that Leshikar's death was in the line of duty, and of no fault of his own. Yet, the Cumberland County Sheriff's Office which ran the investigation of Leshikar's death since it happened off post, ruled it to be a ""justifiable homicide."" Meanwhile, Lavigne's career continued unabated at USASOC.In February 2019, Lavigne had another brush with the law. He was charged with a felony for allegedly harboring an escapee. He was scheduled to appear in court March 12, 2019, but the charges and court date disappeared from court records. Two felony charges literally disappeared from Lavigne’s record with no notation by a Court of what took place. In September 2018, Lavigne was indicted on felony charges for harboring an escapee and for maintaining a vehicle or dwelling to manufacture a controlled substance. According to prosecutors, authorities found a property crime suspect hiding at Lavigne’s home. Drugs were also found in the home. The suspect and a woman who was at Lavigne’s home at the time of the arrests later took responsibility for the drugs. Charges against Lavigne were dropped.Leshikar's death remains in conflict. Special Forces Command decided he died in the line of duty, while the local sheriff's office ruled his death a justifiable homicide, all while Lavigne, continued his work with Delta Force.The mystery and case of the homicides on Dec. 2, 2020 of Master Sgt. William Lavigne and Timothy Dumas at Fort Bragg, North Carolina remains unsolved. Considering how much criminal activity of Lavinge has been covered up previously by authorities it is hard to imagine what the investigation will find. Lavigne sold the home on Anhinga Court in 2019 and his place of residence in the Fort Bragg area was unknown even to investigators. I wonder if these murders will ever be solved considering the criminal activity of both victims. Will the results of the investigation ever be disclosed to the public or buried and made classified ? There is no doubt that something very strange was going on in the life of William Lavigne for him to end up curled up in a fetal position in a truck in boxer shorts and a poncho with gunshot wounds to his torso. The best guess made so far from the evidence available is that these murders were the result of a drug deal gone bad. This begs the question as to why MSG Lavigne had been allowed to carry on as he did since 2018 when drug trafficking rumors had been persistently made against him.It has now been over seventeen(17) months since the bodies were found. There has not been much news about the deaths in several months now except for a Rolling Stone article about unsolved killings at Fort Bragg. There also is the very questionable findings made regarding the death of Sgt. Leshikar. There has been way too much covering up in my opinion. The justifiable homicide finding by the Sheriff’s office was bullshit. The screwdriver was no where near the body of Leshikar. Lavigne was not even given a chemical test to see what was in his system when he killed another person. The Sheriff’s Office allowed a Military friend to take the cell phone of the murder victim and give it to his Sister days later. The Sheriff’s Office never even examined the cell phone of the murder victim. The cell phone belonging to Leshikar should have been examined by law enforcement since Lavigne claimed Leshikar was acting paranoid and unbalanced. The fact that the Sheriff skipped this makes it appear there was never going to be any criminal charges filed against Lavigne.Essentially Lavigne Killed a fellow soldier who was a close personal friend under very suspicious circumstances. Lavigne was transported to the Sheriff’s Office and released in maybe 2 hours time. Lavigne had to know he never face any consequences for killing Leshikar when they never tested him for drugs and accepted a story that he gave that was not matching the physical evidence. That is not a proper investigation of a homicide by any means. The evidence showed Lavigne shot Leshikar at least once while Leshikar was laying down on the floor. Now that Lavigne is dead there will never be an answer as to what really took place regarding the death of Mark Leshikar. I have serious doubts the investigation of these 2 deaths in December 2020 will be handled properly. If the investigation finds that Lavigne was a major drug dealer on Fort Bragg does anyone really think that finding will be disclosed? I can tell you I certainly do not think there will be any honest disclosures made to the public.It would seem to me the cell phone records of the deceased would be your best resource to determine what these 2 men were doing just prior to their deaths. The contacts there would be a treasure trove for information about who and why and how these men might have been killed. Getting those records usually only takes 3 months but can be faster at times. If they were using disposable cell phones just prior to this there could be problems in ascertaining who they were talking with. So if the FBI gets involved and is asking for information 60 days after the deaths that might be bad. As in the cell phone records are not useful or do not exist.On February 2, 2021 it was announced that the FBI was joining with the U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Command in seeking information from the public in connection with the deaths of Lavigne and Dumas. Anyone with information may contact the FBI at their Charlotte Office.FBI photo release of William LavigneFBI photo release of Timothy DumasLavigne's 2016 Chevy Colorado pickup truckDumas, Sr.'s 2015 Dodge Ram pickup truckI am beginning to wonder if this case will ever be solved. The fact that cell phone records have not seemed to lead to any obvious suspects makes me think these murders were planned in advance by professionals. In my opinion if this were just a drug deal gone bad that was random then there would have been plenty of clues to allow the arrests of the killers quickly. The fact that this case has gone 17 months with no arrests makes me think the case has gone cold. Very cold. As each month passes it seems less likely the case will ever be solved.A senior noncommissioned officer assigned to Fort Bragg, was arrested May 12, 2021 for allegedly trafficking more than two kilograms of cocaine after authorities executed a search warrant at a home he owned. Law enforcement found the cocaine, two handguns, one assault rifle and nearly $100,000 in the home at 2647 Green Heron Street in Fayetteville. Authorities arrested 40-year-old Master Sgt. Martin Acevedo III and his son, Javed Josue Acevedo-Ramos, 20, for trafficking a schedule II controlled substance. The raid was coordinated with the Department of Homeland Security.“This case still belongs to the State of North Carolina. It is very probable that it will go federal and Homeland Security will adopt the case,” Cumberland County Sheriff’s Office Sgt. Patrice Bogertey told Army Times. There has been no word on if this recent arrest may be involved in any way with the double homicide.The case has brought renewed attention to the unsolved summer killing of Fort Bragg-based Army Spc. Enrique Roman-Martinez, 21, who vanished May 22, 2020 during a Memorial Day camping trip with fellow soldiers at Cape Lookout National Seashore.Army Spc. Enrique Roman-Martinez, 21The partial remains of the 82nd Airborne Division paratrooper washed up May 29, 2020 on Shackleford Banks Island, according to officials with the U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Command, or Army CID. An autopsy report shows that only Roman-Martinez’s head was found. His jaw was broken in two places and there was “evidence of multiple chop injuries of the head.” There have been some unusual killings of Fort Bragg military and the military should fully investigate and make public disclosures of the results.",UNKNOWN,Aya Kornitschuk,582,0,0,2008,https://www.quora.com/Why-are-there-so-many-unsolved-criminal-case-despite-the-advance-technology

He vanished into thin air.At the time, William and his 5-year-old sister were playing hide and seek around the Benaroon Drive property with his foster mother and grandmother closely watching the children. His mother decided to go inside and make a cup of tea but grew worried as she had not heard the child for a few minutes. At her realization she quickly searched the house and the property to find him.Soon his father returned from work and they went searching up and down the streets for William asking neighbors if they had heard or seen the boy. At 10:56 that day his mother called the police to report a missing person and they arrived 10 minutes later.His mother later recalled that the last time she heard her son he was making a dinosaur noise while chasing his sister ‘Hundreds of hard-working police, members of Emergency Services and members of the community as well as volunteers searched for days and nights to find the missing toddler but to no avail.Specialists were also called to the scene of the crime to see if they could piece together any information that others had not. Helicopters loomed ahead while motorcyclists roamed the grounds along with the others on foot searching in water ways and through the neighboring bush land. All the houses in the nearby area were searched and squad dogs were brought in but could only pick up William’s scent on his grandmother’s property.Later, the police began investigating two cars that were seen parked near the property the day of the disappearance.^An artist's sketch of the cars seen by witnessesThe cars were seen with the windows facing the house wound down and were unrecognized by neighbors. The cars were noticed by William’s mother but have not been seen since that day. On top of this, another car was sighted driving out of Benaroon Drive at about 10:30 AM, which was about the time he vanished. The same vehicle was later seen speeding down another Kendall street. Police did not release this to the public for another 12 months claiming it was an ‘investigation strategy’.People were again left in shock as police suspected William could have been abducted by someone who had a strong connection to an active pedophile ring. To some this came as no surprise as at the place of his disappearance around 20 registered sex offenders lived around the area he went missing.Two of the registered sex offenders living near William’s grandmother met up the day he went missing -- one of the men with over 90 charges against him including aggravated indecent assault of a minor. They denied meeting up but their alibi was proven fake. On top of this, it was reported that both men had been driving vehicles that matched the description of the grey sedan and white station wagon that had been seen near the Tyrrell house around the time William disappeared. Unfortunately this has not been able to have been proven as there is not enough evidence.The family was cleared of any suspicion about the missing boy and have since received about 1,071 suspected sightings. As of now there is a $1,000,000 reward for important information that leads the police to William.His family has made a campaign page hoping to get their boy back:Australians have been left saddened by the case of the missing 3-year-old and we hope we can bring him back soon.If you know anything please call crime stoppers on 1800 333 000^William the day he disappearedraaaaaaarrrrr-AyaInformation sources + if you want to learn moreDisappearance of William Tyrrell - WikipediaWilliam Tyrrell - 9News - Latest news and headlines from Australia and the world^ 60 minutes documentaryEditThank youEdit 2Thanks for all the love xx",385 followers,Bilal Ahmed,3.2K,96,2.3M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Why-are-there-so-many-unsolved-criminal-case-despite-the-advance-technology

Extrinsic:Everything that influences your decision and opinion is stored here (ex: why do you like certain music, food or fashion)The interesting part is this motivation usually does not last more than 3–6 months.3. Obsessions:This stores your passions but also your addictions such as being a workaholic, drugs, shopaholic and chasing stuff.When it’s on, you are not free to choose what you want anymore and will go after the obsession.# Imagination:This is the marvel of evolution, it’s what makes us human.Your imagination driver gives you creativity and adaptation.It should take control when dealing with new and complex situations that require you to think out of the box.People usually don’t let imagination driver take control and stick to their motivation driver instead, which leads them to lose out on big innovations.Examples:These mistakes happened because the people in charge relied on their motivation driver which only thinks from what it already knows - if they had used their imagination driver, they can see a future that Steve Jobs saw.When your imagination driver is taking control, you feel calm and in full control.How to activate it on command? think for yourself these questions:Making yourself answer these questions in your head activates the imagination driver.In conclusion we can say that even though our brain is too complex to summarise in a Quora post, this framework gives us a better idea on how we go about our daily lives and how we can use this knowledge to live a better life.Hope this helps you as much as it helped me.I might be updating this post with more findings, follow it if you want to keep updated.All the best!","1,896 followers",Jalon Fonseca,21.7K,485,5.1M,2017,https://www.quora.com/Why-are-there-so-many-unsolved-criminal-case-despite-the-advance-technology

7,"Not naturally, at least. Ventilation of the lungs depends on oscillating circuits of neurons in the brainstem, which issue signals to the respiratory muscles of the chest. If those circuits gone, pulmonary ventilation ceases.Artificially, though, if the lungs were mechanically ventilated by machine, the lungs themselves could perform their usual function of gas exchange. There’d be no point to it, though, as a person without brainstem function has no chance of recovering any conscious life.","68,794 followers",Kanthaswamy Balasubramaniam,898,17.3K,413.6M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Why-are-there-so-many-unsolved-criminal-case-despite-the-advance-technology
