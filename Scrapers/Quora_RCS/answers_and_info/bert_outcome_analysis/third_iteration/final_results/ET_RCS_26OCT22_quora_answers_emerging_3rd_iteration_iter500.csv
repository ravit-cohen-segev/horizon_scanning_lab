2,"Product management is a discipline best learned by apprenticeship because it is first and foremost about pattern recognition - recognizing patterns of customer problems, markets, sales challenges, and priority conflicts inherent in a product lifecycle.It is hard to get someone to “trust you” as a first time product manager because the decisions you make are largely abstract, there is no clear “yes” or “no”. You can’t really know how well you did until after engineering is spent, and the product shipped, doing well or dying in the market. Even at a junior level, PM to engineering ratios are noProduct management is a discipline best learned by apprenticeship because it is first and foremost about pattern recognition - recognizing patterns of customer problems, markets, sales challenges, and priority conflicts inherent in a product lifecycle.It is hard to get someone to “trust you” as a first time product manager because the decisions you make are largely abstract, there is no clear “yes” or “no”. You can’t really know how well you did until after engineering is spent, and the product shipped, doing well or dying in the market. Even at a junior level, PM to engineering ratios are no less than 1:5 to 1:10, which means a bad decision wastes the time of up to 10 engineers. Their time represents a lot of expected revenue.In short, PM is all about judgement - demonstrating consistently excellent judgement as you apply and demonstrate mastery of a broad set of interdisciplinary leadership, technical, marketing, business strategy and common sense skills.So how do you break into product management?The best way to break in is to find a mid to senior PM leader, maybe 10 years older than you, where you either have interacted, or can interact on a somewhat regular basis. The key is that you want to demonstrate through those interactions that you are someone with excellent judgement as evidenced by applying those skills where you are already really strong. If you are really good at strategy and assessing new markets, find a way to show case that perspective; if you are great at distilling customer feedback, translate that into your view of what are the meaningful problems the product should solve, and how well the current version does that.In those interactions, you want to show that you are smart and hungry — these are the key traits of successful PMs. You have deep intellectual curiosity and you don’t stop at the first answer someone senior or more technical tells you. You are hungry - you don’t just send an email, but you show up at someone’s desk to influence, connect the dots and advocate for your customer or your cause.Tactically, that means you should find 5 or 6 PM leaders you hope will hire you. Download the product and use it — take notes on what you like and what you hate. Where does it wow customers so they open their wallets? Where does it stink? You would be surprised how few PMs actually use the products they manage, so this simple step gives you a leg up. Add competitive research — use the other products in the space, and compare to the product of the leader you hope to win over. This assessment alone, done well, is valuable, and a great reason for a meeting to showcase your judgement and product skills.Good PM leaders are always looking to refresh their team with “junior” PMs who are smart, hungry and show promise of excellent judgement. Why? Because PM is a leadership by influence job — only the senior 1 or 2 leaders get to manage a team (e.g. a VP may only have 15–20 PMs). So many experienced PMs become disgruntled — they ask “when will I get to manage a team”, and you often see orgs with goofy structures where 1 PM reports to 1 PM.For this reason, PM teams of 6–8 have predictable turnover of 1–2 places every 12–18 months. Good PM leaders have a pipeline of possible “stretch” candidates they might take a chance on in a pinch. Your first goal is to get on that list.Adding high powered fresh blood does a lot to improve the team dynamics, enabling mentoring and team development opportunities. It’s also humbling and motivating when the new “junior” PM starts running circles around the more comfortable PMs with supposedly irreplaceable technical skills and domain expertise. Here is aIn addition to showcasing excellent judgement, it isn’t a bad idea to highlight your entrepreneurial chops, even if you failed. The reason is that PM is all about “doing” — connecting the dots that need to be connected and ignoring the ones that are a waste of time. Entrepreneurs, likewise, get something off the ground when no one else believed, and motivate others through risks and uncertainty. Here is a second article on theThere are a couple caveats. First, your 1st move into PM is likely a lateral one, or even a step backward. You will get paid less — for me it was a $25,000 per year reduction. You are leading with a skill set where you are already excellent (strategy consulting, i-banking, engineering management), and you are leaving that behind in order to get a chance to prioritize the work of 10 engineers where bad judgement can have serious consequences. You are no longer getting paid for the skill you are great at, but rather you are trading compensation, and your mastery of a skill so that you can move into a place where you can develop many more skills. It’s an investment.Second, PM is not a job where you get to tell people what to do. Many have this misconception, especially disgruntled engineers, who think that if they can become a PM, they will be in management, and get to tell other engineers what do to. This myth is perpetuated by the mantra that the “PM is the CEO of the product.” The saying is true, but what it means is that the PM is the one person accountable for the success of the product - it doesn’t mean you get to tell people what to do. Rather, you must love to lead by influence — making the voice of the customer so clear, and stating the compelling problem so simply, that agreement is obvious. You influence when engineers say, “I would be fired up to work all night and all weekend to solve that problem.” Never forget that in technical companies, the engineers, not the PM are the star of the show, closely followed by amazing sales people who help customers fully understand their needs (and therefore buy your product). If you lose the confidence of either engineering or sales, it is likely due to poor judgement and your PM career will have an untimely end.Happy hunting and build great products that inspire.","13,182 followers",Ian McAllister,5.7K,141,3.7M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Are-these-the-top-10-emerging-technologies-for-2013

Also, Steven Johnson, who has done numerous Ted talks, has a TV show called How We Got to Now, is excellent and has a great website.Blogs have been mentioned and the usual suspects are Tech Crunch, Mashable, ReCode, etc.  I also find a lot of interesting material on PSFK and IMG Media Labs, and places that publish ideas on innovation and culture more generally.  Not to mention Mary Meeker (formerly Morgan Stanley, now at Kleiner) who publishes publicly an enormous deck (usually about 380 odd pages) specifically on technology trends.Google searches on innovators is always a great idea.  I have a ""mastermind"" list, and I just spend a half hour every week or so, googling these people to see what they're up to.  Elon Musk, Richard Branson, others more specific to my industry, etc.There are a plethora of Ted Talks available on tech and on Youtube.  You can also go to major consulting websites, like Deloitte, McKinsey and others, and see what white papers they've published.  Tech is a very broad spectrum, so you could slice it any way you want, from big data, to Internet of Things, to Healthcare, to Military, to FinTech.  So depending on your interest, find the major players in your industry, look at their websites and usually they'll have a lot of information about where their own industry is headed and how they are ahead of the technology curve (websites are PR pieces, after all) and that will often provide a lot of insight into the trends for a given industry.Hope that's helpful!Your response is private","3,789 followers",Peter Deng,1.2K,102,1M,2016,https://www.quora.com/Are-these-the-top-10-emerging-technologies-for-2013

Perhaps the best answer is the question “What do you expect of the two?” and following close on its heels is “Why limit yourself to one?”Most people who start Medicine have wildly unreasonable expectations—and after 40 years I guess the reason why I still enjoy it is the fact that I’ve managed to cling to these wildly unreasonable expectations.

I suspect that the same is true for CS—although nowadays I suspect that many or perhaps most programmers see it more as a job than as a passion to indulge. (In any occupation, this dynamic tension between idealism and the pragmatism of money in the bank and putting food on the table is there—ask a passionate chef). Come to think of it, many doctors are the same—and miserable in consequence. This largely wasn’t the case say 30 years ago. I think the things that endear me to Medicine are both the intellectual challenge and the need to help others—but also the enjoyment of human interaction, and perhaps being fairly good at my job. There’s also the control aspect—many doctors are ‘Type A’ personalities. Can you see that, depending on how you work things out, CS may offer similar privileges?Both have their down-side, but I suspect that having to work insanely hard is shared by every worthwhile discipline, even if you are extraordinarily lucky. I’m in the fortunate situation that I can easily earn twice as much doing Medicine as I could by doing CS exclusively, without nowMany of these changes will likely not be the ones people are currently predicting—for example, AI replacing doctors (even surgeons) and AI replacing programmers (even less likely). The important bits of both Medicine and CS lie beneath the surface, and until you’ve done at least 10,000 hours (yeah, that magic number is not far off, despite being disparaged of late), you really don’t grok either.The deep down-sides of both are more philosophical than you might imagine, and remarkably, are quite similar in both Medicine and CS. (I suspect this is an underlying thread that imperils many technical people and perhaps even entire societies, and is hugely underappreciated). In my opinion—and heck, I could be wrong—these relate to what I might call an “ontological fixation”, the view that most things fall into rigid categories, and can be managed accordingly. Again to me, this disease seems most marked in the USA, but is widespread. In Medicine, this results in the practising of unscientific medicine—unreasonably hanging on to frankly wrong diagnoses, and indeed wrong treatments, way past their sell-by date; and many more faults besides. In CS, I see a somewhat different pathology, where attempts to coerce problems into pre-conceived solutions (or even cookie-cutter solutions) results in bulky and dysfunctional code and entire projects that aren’t fit for purpose. This is a creeping disease in a variety of businesses and institutions too, which are now increasingly managed by short term goals and rigidly defined objectives, and touches on disciplines as widely diverse as psychiatry, social sciences and physics. But it comes down to bad models—and bad science.There’s worse to come. Both Medicine and CS have largely succumbed to managerial bureaucracy, where the managers haven’t understood (or even read) Deming andIf you’re smart then why not try to bridge the chasm between CS and Medicine? Do both! But beware. Although the two are bound to come together, and there will be great rewards for those skilled at both, this won’t be easy. A lot of the foundational work thatDoing either Medicine or CS right is insanely difficult, so many confine themselves to a tiny, mechanistic, often trivial part of one or the other—but your question suggests that this may not be you.Go into either with your eyes wide open, try to actually experience both—at the coal face, early on—and even have a third string to your bow.My 2c, Dr Jo.",215 followers,Sameer Gulati,898,0,0,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-top-new-skills-technologies-trends-that-a-product-manager-should-be-on-top-of

The history of USA begins with revolutions - the rail road connecting the west to east - the inter state highways etc…It is easier to show than to tell. Let me show you a few maps and try to figure out why China is developing faster than India.Exhibit 1 - USAExhibit 2 - CANADAExhibit 3 - EuropeExhibit 4 - ChinaExhibit 5- IndiaTHE YELLOW LINESDo you see the yellow lines? The yellow lines are six lane express ways - Interstate high speed lines. Do you see how many highways exist in USA? USA is filled with yellow lines - These yellow lines are like high speed - 1GBPS optical fibers laid across the country i.e. I can take my huge truck full of cars from one corner of my country to the other without applying any brakes in full throttle and conduct my business. i.e. SELL;Now COMPARE USA with CANADA.In Canada - Unfortunately only three cities are well connected with Highways - Toronto - Ottawa - Montreal - Qubec city and Nova Scotia - The rest of he nation is a barren waste land - Yes people live there but - they are virtually disconnected - unless they are willing to fly!So is USA better than CANADA - Not Really - USA has a better climate than Canada - If Canada was not the SIBERIA of AMERICAS it would have been filled with mesh of express ways like USA.EUROPE VS RUSSIAThe tale repeats - The most concentration of expressways is in a few countriesNetherlands - Belgium Germany -Denmark - France - Have this tightly knit spider web of express ways - Check them outCHINA vs INDIANow let us take a look at china - They laid so many roads that it is filled with express ways - six lane roadsCompare that with IndiaIndia has only two express ways - For a country of Billion People(1) New Delhi - Agra - Lucknow - The Yamuna Express way - (Vishal Khanna - Thanks for the edit )-(2) Ahmedabad to Vadodara - Barely visible on this mapPAKISTAN - It has one huge expressway connecting - Islamabad - Lahore - Peshawar - Thank to CHINA.What is TRADE?(1) MANUFACTURING AND SERVICES - Development Products (R&D) or People (training)(2) LOGISTICS - The movement of Goods or People(3) SALES AND MARKETING - The art of Selling Goods or PeopleLet us take this simple definition - for practical purposes - There are tons of other factors involved in trade and development - like Imports - Exports - Comparative Advantage - Exchange Rates - Fiscal Policy - Monetary PolicyLet us ignore all of them for a moment - Let us consider internal trade of various countries.The hallmark of a developed country is the ease of trade - The ease of starting a business.If I do not have a place to sit - i.e. to set up shop - Where would I start Manufacturing or Training PeopleIn India - If I wish to set up a factory - I would not have any buildings - I would not find any free space - If I do find a free space - There would be tons of red tape before I can get approvals - If there is no infrastructure to begin with I would not be able to do anything. I visit the local government school and I find that the roof leaks when it rains - does not have a fan in hot summer - is not connected by roads - the roads that are laid - were laid ten years ago and are now filled with pot holes. LOGISTICS i.e. the art of moving goods - there are no roads - There are no air ports - there are no shipping ports. SALES and MARKETING - selling Indian Goods - is pain not just in the ass but all over! You will understand this because - every Indian Good falls short in quality - according to international standards - most of the Indian goods are discarded i.e. thrown away because they don’t fit the requirements set by the buyer. Corruption is not a problem - it never was - Businessmen would earn more profits to pay for the corrupt - but the problem is that the corrupt money is not being used for infrastructure - China is as corrupt as India!What is China Doing?China has many structural advantages compared to IndiaThey are communists - They will kill anyone who stands in the way of the state! They will not hesitate - They will not forgive - They will exterminate ruthlessly.The state is atheist not secular - The state only tolerates religion and culture - mind the word TOLERATES i.e. if the state at any point of time believes that the religion is against the state or any culture is against the state - It will exterminate the religion or the culture. The great cultural destruction during Mao’s era is a proof of the extremes to which Chinese would go!It is a very good thing - China had a clean slate - a fresh slate - a slate cleansed with blood of many people who died during the struggle. China got rid of all the superstitions along with their old culture. India on the other hand lives in these superstitions -China is a COPY PASTE MACHINE - of profit makingChina copies - it copies profit making machines - If a business model is working - they will copy it - They copied Iphone - not just the phone but the Istore - that is an incredible achievement - They copied KFC - They copied McDonalds i.e. in china there is a chain of McDonald stores - not owned by McDonald. They have a copy of facebook - they have a copy of uber - they have a copy of twitter - they have a copy of a copy of a copy i.e. there are other companies trying to make copies of the chinese copies.The entire chinese state understood - the necessity of development - and they are pushing for it at any cost. Most of the chinese cities are covered with smog - but chinese can’t afford to stop their development - They need to make goods - services and sell them to make profits - as long as they make profits they develop.The Chinese are done with roads within their countryThe Chinese are done with RailsThe Chinese are done with PORTS - All these are ports developed by ChinaThe Growth Engine of China owes a lot of its Exports and Export trade is done by ships - not by road or by rail. Globalization happened over Container Terminals, Ports and Oceans - Unfortunately most of Indian - Ports are unfit for Docking International Ships - Hilarious but True - Indians never invested in making their ports world class - Chinese are done with ports not only in their country but also internationally -The Chinese are NOT Done with AIRPORTS YETThe only comparable infrastructure of India with China is in terms of AIRPORTS - India can compete with China on air traffic.But this too will pass - With China building hundreds of airports - by 2020 they will induct more than 100 new airports - to tackle the extreme congestion and delays in air port travel across the nation.I WILL SUM IT UPIndia pales in comparison to China in International PatentsNOTHING CAN BE DONE WITHOUT INVESTMENT IN INFRASTRUCTURE - i.e. utilization of WEALTH to create more WEALTH - which starts a virtuous cycleEquivalent to investing the first twenty years of your life to education - China spent twenty years of its life from 1980 to 2000 in learning about developing profit making machines and investing in them - building cities - tows - roads - railways - and everything and anything in a mad rush to build - sell - repeat;make - sell - repeat; after millions of these selling cycles to international customers - The Country is now reaping the fruits of its investments made decades ago and pursued relentlessly.",24 followers,Amartya Banerjee,504,188,3M,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-top-new-skills-technologies-trends-that-a-product-manager-should-be-on-top-of

She turned to me and said, “Do you have washing machines in Scotland?” Obviously, I was forced to admit, that no we didn’t. Instead we just went down to the river and bashed our clothes off rocks to clean them.2) Transport - I spent two weeks in the lovely town of Columbia. Missouri. There I amazed the locals with my insistence on using a strange outmoded form of transport known as “walking”. Locals would slow down as they passed in their modern cars, pointing and laughing. To them, it must have been like watching a live action version of the Flintstones.3) Voting – would you believe it, but in the UK we still vote by drawing a little X next to the candidate we want to vote for. No sign of the advanced electronic voting they have over in the states. Indeed, we are so old fashioned that we haven’t even outsourced our voting to the Russians yet!4) Guns – It may be hard for an American to believe but almost nobody in the UK owns their own guns. This means that if we have to rise up and overthrow our own government (currently seems like a good plan) then we will be armed with nothing more than some particularly well sharpened sarcasm.Still, perhaps one day we can hope to be as advanced as the US.

Too much attrition of good startups is not healthy.I'm talking more about hardware-software solutions than just software alone here.In the US DARPA and DoD helped setup much of the ecosystem that built the Silicon Valley, startup culture. In India can we claim the same with or without the “Make in India”?!!Bitter Fact is that US/Russia/France are selling arms and technology and smothering any feeble attempts at developing a startup ecosystem. Where 100s and 1000s of billions are at stake, can the poor Indian startup even hope to survive in the shark tank of big arms dealers and their direct/indirect agents??!!There are a few instances of startups being used as show pieces but nothing like a flood of startups making it big!!Unless Indians get in queue to start startups hearing of their neighbours who made it big in tech startups, India will not be able to break out of the ‘technology consumer' trap to become a ‘technology producer'!!","113,616 followers",Anuradha Tiwari,4.2K,0,0,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-top-new-skills-technologies-trends-that-a-product-manager-should-be-on-top-of
