0,"Computers speed is still limited by the physical restrictions of an electron moving through matter. What technologies are emerging to break through this speed barrier?There are no “emerging” technologies.Allegedly, an electron moves through copper wire at about one-third light speed. So, obviously, you could get a speed boost by using light itself to move those signals at light speed - except guess what, they’ve been trying for 30 years that I know of, and still have been unable to build a practical computer.All the speed boosts since the beginning have been made by shortening the path lengthsComputers speed is still limited by the physical restrictions of an electron moving through matter.

1,"I will give you a more subjective, but also very context rich answer:Yes and no - depending on how you look at it. Also there is some historic perspective involved.Lets start…Single core CPU performance has two limits: maximum attainable IPC and maximum attainable clock rate. We WILL hit a limit there, in the not so far future. Instruction level parallelism will only take you so far, but the other limiting factor is the minimum amount of clock cycles necessary theoretically for certain operations.a)I will give you a more subjective, but also very context rich answer:Yes and no - depending on how you look at it. Also there is some historic perspective involved.Lets start…Single core CPU performance has two limits: maximum attainable IPC and maximum attainable clock rate. We WILL hit a limit there, in the not so far future. Instruction level parallelism will only take you so far, but the other limiting factor is the minimum amount of clock cycles necessary theoretically for certain operations.a) From what I gathered, it will never be possible, for example, to have integer multiplication faster than 2 clock cycles, because two subsequent operations which can’t be parallelized (shifts + add) are involved. So there is a hard limit, but we haven’t reached it yet.b) Instruction level parallelism (“superscalar execution”) is limited by maximum parallelism that can be “mined” from an instruction stream (think about “tight loops”) using out of order execution - while this helps with utilizing execution resources A LOT, interdependencies and flow control will put a limit here. I think we may have already reached this limit with only VERY little wiggle room left.c) Multiple pipelines working on a single set of execution resources (hyperthreading / SMT) helps breaking the superscalar limitations but comes with other problems - cache trashing being only one of them, on a higher level even thread synchronization can limit here. We may have reached about 80% of the potential of this technique.d) Clock rates - thats the hardest part. Intel tried to pull off 10 GHz with their NetBurst-architecture (Pentium 4) back in the 2000s, but failed epically. Thermal limitations, to start with.In experiments with overclocking we have seen clock rates around 8.5 Ghz, but this is only under liquid nitrogen cooling and similar stunts, which are not practical.My best guess is that we will basically max out at around 6.2–6.5 GHz, and it’s over.e) The limitations of DRAM, because, while being cheap, DRAM is an inherently slow technology. And we can’t have SRAM for main memory, this would break every budget from the sheer amount of transistor estate necessary (about 4x as much as DRAM afair, but maybe someone else knows more)2. Now to the GOOD NEWS - have you heard about our lord and saviour, the multi core? :-)This is where we WILL see serious gains. Generic software engineers are actually only learning NOW how to use high core count CPUs properly, many tools are not yet there, but will at some point.Sadly, ultrawide vector processing will not save the day. AVX512 is, for all practical purposes, AT BEST giving minor improvements over AVX256, but this could also be because of transistor estate / other technological limitations.Eventually we will probably end up with CPUs with about 6.5 GHz, hundreds of cores and software that can actually use them.And don’t forget: GPGPUs and other specialized hardware is here to stay as well. Maybe a change in the public mindset is key to the next big leap in performance?Also the general public WILL have to get used to liquid cooling. Air cooling will only get you so far, even if there are advancements lately. But, honestly, I don’t see the problem with having 280mm / 360mm rads even in an office PC with an AIO cooling system for the CPU. As I always say when it comes to water cooling: “don’t listen to the boomers”.","9,991 followers",Brett Bergan,1.3K,7K,83.6M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Computers-speed-is-still-limited-by-the-physical-restrictions-of-an-electron-moving-through-matter-What-technologies-are-emerging-to-break-through-this-speed-barrier

4,I think America’s problem with Huawei is the one thing that is not been said. Huawei will not give the CIA a backdoor into the software. They claim that they did not give the Chinese government one either.So who to believe. my Life experience tells me not to believe the Americans. And I don’t see the Chinese bombing other countries.OTOH the software and hardware is superior to anything else out there and I think we shall see more and more countries using it.The world has a new rhinoceros. Get used to it America.Edit: well that stirred the pot a bit!,1 follower,Mary Lynch,1.5K,7.2K,11.4M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Computers-speed-is-still-limited-by-the-physical-restrictions-of-an-electron-moving-through-matter-What-technologies-are-emerging-to-break-through-this-speed-barrier
