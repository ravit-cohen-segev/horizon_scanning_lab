Starting with paper making which was taken from china and transformed into industrial production by the arabs, the arabs introduced sugarcane plantation and sugar from india into egypt and modified the irrigation system which gave birth to sugar industry, a single most important industry of the colonial times, the arabs started mass productions of soaps, while europe was suffering from black death due to bad hygiene, the eastern countries were enjoying high luxury bathing in their hammams and running streams of waters in their gardens. When Abbasids sent elephant clock to Charlemagne’s court in the 9th century, they were shocked by this technology. Muslims laid the base for universities, colleges and learning centres in europe in muslim spain, this went on to become oxford and cambridge in UK. Muslims were the first to award degrees not the europeans. maths, First hospitals in europe were founded by the muslims as well. Europeans couldn’t even count properly, it were arabs who after learning numeral system form indians introduced it to the europeans, indian numerals were invented in the 5th century and didn’t reach europe until 14th century nearly 1000 years later. Printing was introduced to europe by arabs as well. If you go through medieval manuscripts of the arab world, you will find how they practically nurtured the technological advancements of the western europeans in all fields from chemistry, physics, maths, medicine, the muslim books were taught in european ‘’universities’’ for a long time.regards",108 followers,Tigran Minasyan,1.3K,0,0,2018,https://www.quora.com/Is-the-notion-of-progress-especially-technological-progress-uniquely-European-idea-Did-other-civilizations-Mayans-Incas-Ancient-Egypt-have-their-own-version-of-it-Did-they-believe-that-other-societies-must-would

The same point can be seen over much of the world, from the Sahel, Mesoamerica, the Andes regions or the middle east. States that were relatively similar seemed to rise and fall one each other, rarely seeing radical progress in important technologies. So this seems to have made a cyclical view of history much more common before the modern age.It also seems that todays common view that society progress also need to have had a noticeable amount of technical progress over a relatively short time. It is worth noting that the idea that society were progressing did not shape european culture either until relatively lately. Maybe not before the end of the 18th century or thereby. The genre of science fiction for example did not really develop until the 19th century.It is also worth noting that before this time, even the left did not view society as something that would progress. Rather, protorevolutionary movements rather seemed to look back at a golden age of freedom in the past. Something that truly did not change until around the french revolution. It can even be seen in marxism, even though Marx seems to both use the concept of an original communist state of human society, and the possibily of forming a kind of utopia through progress like Saint Simon.",UNKNOWN,Prophet Kendrick O.,3.6K,862,16.1M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Is-the-notion-of-progress-especially-technological-progress-uniquely-European-idea-Did-other-civilizations-Mayans-Incas-Ancient-Egypt-have-their-own-version-of-it-Did-they-believe-that-other-societies-must-would
2,"If mounted as an international effort, bonding many countries together in a united effort, it’s certainly possible that it could be a moment great than the first moon landing.

The journey will likely be presented as representing humankind, but the effort will be staged and facilitated by singular visionaries (whether or not Elon Musk).I also think the esteemed Quorans that answered this question are underestimating the dream quotient here. As an eight year old when Apollo 11 landed on the moon, I can’t begin to describe what that moment meant as a symbol of am exciting, hopeful and optimistic future. With all the unrest in the world today, such a journey has the potential to capture the imagination of billions worldwide. Certainly, the Mars Landing and First Footprint will be watched by billions (Perhaps even the inevitable conspiracy theorists who will conclude that the entire effort was a hoax).",3 followers,Steve Baker,795,27.4K,163.3M,2017,https://www.quora.com/Is-the-notion-of-progress-especially-technological-progress-uniquely-European-idea-Did-other-civilizations-Mayans-Incas-Ancient-Egypt-have-their-own-version-of-it-Did-they-believe-that-other-societies-must-would
3,"No. Unless the first man on Mars is Buzz Aldrin. And even then…Going to Mars cannot have the same psychological impact as the first Apollo lunar landing. Nothing short of visitation of Earth by Jesus flying the Mellinium Falcon or a race of brain-men in hypersauser could overshadow the moon landing, at least to anyone familiar with the event.Consider that until about 1963, people commonly said things like “You can no more do that than you can fly to the moon.” By 1970, nobody said that anymore, they said “They can send a man to the moon, but they can’t make a decent toaster.”The Apollo moon laNo. Unless the first man on Mars is Buzz Aldrin.

It was such an incandescent triumph, it nearly extinguished the flame of space exploration, because after rushing headlong to the moon, we simply could not continue spending money or taking risks at the same pace, everything else seemed puny, and the wind largely fell from our sails.Mars will be different. First, it will likely be private and/or international. Second, the technology will evolve over a longer time span (a process that started fifty years ago) so it will not have the same bold “Manhattan Project” aura.Which means that sadly, most people just won’t care, at least not the way they did that night in July, 1969 when everyone around the world gathered by the TV or the radio or the ticker in Times Square, or the transistor radio in Swazilandand held a collective breath.If space takes away your breath, you might enjoy my",UNKNOWN,Ernest W.

4,"I'd say yes. Considering there are more people alive that didn't witness the moon landing on TV when it occurred it would be a bigger event to those people having it occur during their time on earth. It wouldn't minimize the significance of the moon landing but it would be, to me certainly, a larger accomplishment and greater feat of mankind- to have traveled to another planet and set foot there. It would be the difference between your first bike ride and your first plane ride out of town. Sure the bike was exciting and new and you where young and it felt so much more important but as an adultI'd say yes.

9,Its hard to say what we might look like. One trend that has been noticed just in the last 200 years is that we are getting taller. Its possible that sexual selection is responsible for this trend.Humans are one of the very few creatures on the planet that have the ability to direct their own evolution. What we will look like is very hard to say. Genetic modification could play a big role. If we are able to offer “designer genes” in the future to would be parents we might end up with a race of humans that eventually all look quite similar.
