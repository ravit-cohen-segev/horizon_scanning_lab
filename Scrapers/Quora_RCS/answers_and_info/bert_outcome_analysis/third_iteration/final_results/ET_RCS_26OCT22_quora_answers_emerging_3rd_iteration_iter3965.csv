0,Your assumptions are outrageous. Lumping a large body of people daring to challenge some of the ridiculous claims and outlandish solutions of the Green Movement into the simple derogatory term ‘Denier’ is not a sensible way forward.,"4,849 followers",Jon Michael Sakamoto,1.3K,3.4K,16.7M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Why-do-climate-change-deniers-and-peak-oil-deniers-try-to-make-their-points-by-attacking-successful-new-alternative-technologies-with-outdated-facts-Do-they-deny-the-proven-curve-of-technology-adoption-or-are-they
1,"Imagine you were sent back in time to the stone age.Unfortunately you are stuck there until you can make a cell phone to call for help. Fortunately you are immortal, so you can take as long as you need.How long will it take you to make a cellphone?You already have the massive advantage of 1) knowing that cellphones are possible, 2) having a vague idea of the technologies involved.But consider that there are 118 known elements. (eg. Hydrogen, Helium, Lithium etc…) and the typical cell phone uses 75 of those elements.You have to figure out:Imagine you were sent back in time to the stone age.Unfortunately you are stuck there until you can make a cell phone to call for help.

(eg. Hydrogen, Helium, Lithium etc…) and the typical cell phone uses 75 of those elements.You have to figure out:Of all those, you probably only really know the last one. (#8)What else you know depends on your profession.If you are a Geologist, you might know what some elements look like in nature.If you are a Miner, you might know how to extract some of them from the earth.If you are a Refining Plant Manager you might know how to refine some of them.If you are a Materials Scientist or Metallurgist you might know how to combine some of them into polymers or alloys.If you are an Engineer you might know how to design parts of a cellphone, but probably only some of the parts.If you are a Mechanist or Factory Worker you might know how to build some of the parts.If you are a Software Engineer you might know how to program some of the electronics.What we are getting at is that there is no such thing as a “Cellphone Maker”.But it gets worse.While the professions listed above know aspects of how to make a cellphone, they also rely on other technology in order to do their jobs.For the Geologist, lets say he really knows his rocks and doesn’t need any fancy electronic testing equipment, which is a good thing, because such equipment is just as complex as a cellphone.But he needs the Miner to dig and get at rocks and oil underground before he can identify them. For this, theSo before we can start making a cell phone, we’re going to need to make an steel pickaxe.How to make an Steel Pickaxe:Oops. We don’t have a pickaxe yet, that’s what we’re trying to make. Now what? How else can we make a pickaxe?How to make a Stone Pickaxe:Oops. We don’t have any rope. Or leather cord. Or anything else to tie with.How to make a Leather Cord:Oops. We need leather first. Where are we going to get leather?How to make Leather:Oops. We don’t have any cows because they haven’t been domesticated yet. We’ll have to make our leather out of something else, such as a deer.How to kill a Deer:Really? A bow and arrow? How do we make that? Better just look for a dead deer lying around somewhere. Oh look there’s one over there. Perfect.How to make Leather From a Deer (Round 2):Just kidding. Don’t have a knife.How to make Leather From a Deer (Round 3):Where do we get salt? Ok the ocean has salt. Easy.How to get Salt from the Ocean:Oh no. How do we make a bucket?How to make a Leather Bucket:Nope. Don’t even start.How to make a Reed Bucket:Ok, we can do that. Finally, progress.How to get Salt from the Ocean (Round 2):That took awhile, but now we got the salt. Now back to the leather.How to make Leather From a Deer (Round 4):Lime? As in the fruit? Oh… you mean limestone. We can find some of that.How to make Lime:How to make Leather From a Deer (Round 4, continued):6. Boil the brain of the deer in water to create a tanning solution.Oh darn. Now we need a pot. And a fire.How to make a Fire:Ok great, we have a fire. Now we need a pot.How to make a Clay Pot:Great. We’re on a roll now. Back to that leather.How to make Leather From a Deer (Round 4, continued):6. Boil the brain of the deer in water to create a tanning solution.7. Soak the deer hide in the tanning solution.8. Hang the leather up to dry.Whew. Finally. Leather.How to make a Leather Cord (Round 2):How to make a Stone Pickaxe (Round 2):Alright. Got it.How to make an Steel Pickaxe (Round 2):A Forge? You mean we can’t use a regular fire? Ahh. Its not hot enough.How to build a Forge:Charcoal?How to make Charcoal:????…As you can see. Even the simplest tasks are not so simple. It seems like technology is progressing really fast today, but that is because of all the technology that literally took ages to figure out.How long would it take to figure out how to do any of the simple technologies above, simply by trial and error? It could take a really long time, for example, to figure out what Iron Ore looks like, and how to build a forge hot enough to melt it. Especially if you didn’t even have any idea that Iron even exists.I mean, come on. Everyone knows rocks don’t melt. If they did, how could we use them to build ovens. Right????So there are a lot of hurdles. But once a technology has been figured out, we can build on it to create the next step.These days, we’ve figured out enough things to do a lot. We’ve also figured out something called science, which is the art of figuring out new things.Tasks that were once really hard, become much easier. Look at how you would get that pickaxe in the 21st Century.How to get a Steel Pickaxe (Modern Edition)Ahh.

2,"I see no evidence that the mobile phone industry has fallen down. It's still a massive industry.In any industry, the relative success of any specific company can shift as markets shift. For example, Apple was the second largest seller of smartphones. Today, they're probably fourth, depending on how much the US ban has hurt Huawei, and counting BBK Electronics (OPPO, Vivo, and OnePlus) as a single company. But Apple is still the most profitable company in smartphones.Welcome to the maturing of a market. This is to be expected, and it's happened elsewhere.

But Apple is still the most profitable company in smartphones.Welcome to the maturing of a market. This is to be expected, and it's happened elsewhere. If you had a PC in the 1990s, you might have felt like you needed an update every year or two. The technology was rapidly evolving. But when was the last time you felt held back by your PC? I built a high-end PC back in 2013, and as a power user I was still pretty happy with it when it died last month… I'm even happier with the upgrade, but it wasn't justified by the performance of my old system.Or consider digital cameras. There was a time when the camera you bought last year was replaced by one twice as good for half the price in a year or two. And so the market exploded, because people bough digital cameras, replaced those, replaced them again. But today, any ILC produces better images than film. Smartphones employ AI and computational photography to give novices a taste of the superpowers of serious photographers using serious system cameras. And so the camera industry has contracted to where it was in the 1970s, when you probably bought a new camera because the old one broke… I did just that in January.So phones are mature. They're not peaking... that implies a downhill slide is imminent in technology. It may be your use of the phone has peaked. Phone still go faster every year, but does that matter to most users?My phone is from 2015, and I purposely have not upgraded because phones today have moved in the wrong direction for me. My phone, the LG V10, is made well enough to be used without a case. Today's phones are all-glass, many top models (Apple, Samsung) have set new records for breakability. They have fixed batteries not user swappable. Today I'm headed out to a music festival with 4 spare camera batteries and two spare phone batteries, enough to last the day without the clumsy and annoying need to cable in a power brick.Both of these moves work toward that mature market replacement point: my thing broke, I need a new one. Not because the current one no longer serves me, just because it failed. In a big way, it was designed to fail sooner than previous phones, though of course, every manufacturer will have other motives to claim for these “innovations,” but when they all go the same way, it's pretty clear they benefit the phone makers. Not the consumers.",2 followers,Suba Rajagopal,4.7K,0,0,2019,https://www.quora.com/Why-do-climate-change-deniers-and-peak-oil-deniers-try-to-make-their-points-by-attacking-successful-new-alternative-technologies-with-outdated-facts-Do-they-deny-the-proven-curve-of-technology-adoption-or-are-they
3,"Mobile phones have not “demised” mearly plateaued. Each country contains a certain amount of people and when a brand new invention is created and released into the general public for the first time then it's only natural everybody wants one. When this did happen pretty much anybody who could afford one went out and acquired one and sales went sky high. In the ensuing years as every new model became available everyone wanted one. I can remember not that long ago people camping outside the Apple shop inside shopping centres the night before to be first in because come 9am the que went for miles.Mobile phones have not “demised” mearly plateaued.

As years passed ques diminished to the point they are now non existent. Sales have slowed simply because nearly every man and his dog have one and are not so eager to rush out and purchase the newest model as their current is satisfies them. Major phone sellers Apple and Samsung have been so successful they have created this stagnation that people don't feel the need to upgrade so eagerly and going by pure numbers it was inevitable that sales would have a lull period, which is slightly different then a demise.",230 followers,Niraj Kasat,1.3K,0,0,2021,https://www.quora.com/Does-the-lack-of-advanced-communication-technology-in-the-ancient-world-mean-that-human-verbal-interaction-peaked-thousands-of-years-ago
4,"It's obviously a huge industry making extraordinary sums of money, but technology wise I can see a point that tech in phones today is not so remarkably different from tech 3 years ago.The primary difference, is that phones are starting to come out from China which are a third of the price of the mainstream flagship phones but almost as capable.The problem is the same one that befell laptops for a while, and that is two things - ‘battery’ and things being ‘good enough’.At one time PCs were constantly evolving and getting better.

Each year devices would start to feel slow as operating system upgrades added more and more features and purchasing a faster new computer felt truly like an improvement.Then mobile and laptops came out and suddenly all of that capability and power, all of those features were now a liability. A battery would last only a couple of hours and the computer was big, heavy and cumbersome. So a dumbed down less feature rich operating system like Android or Ipad suddenly looked more capable.The rush to the smart phones for the OS vendors is really a rush to the smart phone stores. In that world, there is absolutely no interest in a phone with standout capabilities, when what you really want is as many customers as possible to buy your app.On the PC the Windows operating system spent several years having to focus NOT on expecting people to continually upgrade their computer but to want ever lighter ones with better battery life. That means Windows for years has focussed on working with good performance and has not added any power demanding features for over a decade.The form factor reached a technological peak, the battery has reached a peak, the screen resolution.Phones can hardly be lighter, battery can hardly be better, a Microsoft Surface is now really a perfect size for a computer, and phones are all converging on phones the size of your hand.So the devices are now ‘Good enough’ for most people.The stores are too big for any phone maker to want to make any radical changes, but the path is now open for the PC to come back and do something.The PC was always much better at interfacing to things, or doing lots of things at once as it came from a desktop world.
