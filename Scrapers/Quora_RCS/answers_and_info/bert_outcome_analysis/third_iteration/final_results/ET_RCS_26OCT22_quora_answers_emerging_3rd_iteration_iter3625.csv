4,"No. CERN and other public science organisations have no incentive to keep major developments secret for longer than the minimum time needed to get a publication ready for submission.Plus, we leak like a sieve. Even the recent major developments and hints of new physics from CERN have all had their official announcements preceded by suspiciously accurate predictions on external science blog sites. There’s no way we could keep genuinely world-changing developments secret… the anti-grav mat would immediately be all over YouTube with PhD students using it to do a silly dance / bad physics rap arouNo. CERN and other public science organisations have no incentive to keep major developments secret for longer than the minimum time needed to get a publication ready for submission.Plus, we leak like a sieve.

5,"The organisations you named are public and don’t conduct any “secret” research. Everything they do is published (unless it turns out a flop not worth publishing :) ). CERN especially is ill-suited for any secret work, because it hosts scientists and engineers from the entire world, and any of them can enter everywhere he/she wants. I worked at CERN, there is no security like many companies have: no systems of permissions to enter specific building, no access cards and readers on every door… If you can’t enter somewhere it is solely for safety reasons (like you can’t enter the LHC tunnel when iThe organisations you named are public and don’t conduct any “secret” research.

I worked at CERN, there is no security like many companies have: no systems of permissions to enter specific building, no access cards and readers on every door… If you can’t enter somewhere it is solely for safety reasons (like you can’t enter the LHC tunnel when it has circulating beams). But even such places are in principle accessible to anyone when there is no danger.But come to think about it: lots of “everyday” technology is a miracle for modern people, they just got used to it, so they don’t think about is as a miracle. A modern smartphone with all the infrastructure that supports it is a miracle. The fact, that NASA can get those high quality photos of distant planets is a miracle. The fact that at CERN they can detect and track to micron precision the path of something as small as a single electron is a miracle. At least 95% of those modern people would not be able to explain how it is done, for them it could be magic…","68,768 followers",Kanthaswamy Balasubramaniam,898,17.3K,413.3M,2016,https://www.quora.com/Is-it-possible-that-demons-are-just-irresponsible-humans-who-have-lived-on-the-earth-and-died-and-have-access-to-advanced-technology
6,"Force Fields.These are a great invention for humanity. Not only do they allow for almost every sci-fi scenario imaginable, they also add a great deal of value onto the human life.Right now, human lives mean very little in the face of high-end destructive technology like nuclear weapons. A single bomb can kill millions.With force fields, that would change everywhere. Nuclear weapons would be far less effective, and our constant protection would ensure the survival of our species and help us expand everywhere, including into space.As a human, your life isForce Fields.These are a great invention for humanity.

7,"It is their charter to invent and explore technology and bring those technologies back to the US people.But due to harsh environments and remote locations, they tend to build systems very conservatively. Many successful systems have had lifetimes many times in excess of the original design. Some systems with life time of 5 years have lasted as long as 19 years!Some aeronautical engineers call the rockets from Huntsville, “The Bridge and Iron Works” because the way many rockets were over-built. But “over built” prevented other problems and the Saturn series got USA to the moon.I worked at NASAIt is their charter to invent and explore technology and bring those technologies back to the US people.But due to harsh environments and remote locations, they tend to build systems very conservatively.

But “over built” prevented other problems and the Saturn series got USA to the moon.I worked at NASA I found that their software is NOT on the cutting edge.They are very suspicious of new software concepts. After all, they systems are deep in space and a computer glitch could lead to loss of a spacecraft which is a one-of-a-kind.NASA Systems Engineering is unique. For the reliability of one-of-kind systems is difficult.Their testing of software is much more rigors, through, thought out, and expansive of any software development teams. And they are willing to spend to the money on hardware and software to test out “Flight Software.”I had the privilege to work with one of the programmers of the Apollo Guidance Computer.

8,"We are nowhere near it.Nowhere. Not even slightly.An exoskeleton that allows the user to have greater strength for lifting in specific circumstances? Yes. But not a suit.

You need the actuators to give it the stretch but the suit would fall apart from stress so you need the exotic materials but then you need to power it so you need a power source that generates enough power in a tiny space that doesn’t kill the wearer with radiation and heat, but you can’t fly unless you have repulsors and then you can’t control it because you don’t have the mind interface, but then you are limited in what you can do unless you have the most advanced and complete and benign AI installed but you can’t do that unless you have the computing power that is insanely powerful in a tiny space and none of that matters because a couple hits from physical attacks would turn your body and brain to jelly from the outside shocks so you need electronic inertial dampeners that would put the Enterprise to shame.And that’s why we can’t have nice things.PS - I’m sure I missed something. :)","7,171 followers",Barak Shoshany,1.6K,1K,7.5M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Is-it-possible-that-there-exists-so-advanced-technology-that-even-modern-people-would-find-miracle-kept-so-hidden-from-public-by-CERN-NASA-etc
