2,"The country that is closest in its mix might be Singapore. The problem there is the society is pretty regimented. I'm not sure they can attract the kind of global talent they need to pull off another Silicon Valley. What they have done is make NUS into something that really is moving ahead. Thailand is an interesting possibility. Peter Thiel seems to think the ""next"" Silicon Valley may involve creation of floating cities like Milton's grandson, Patri Friedman wants to do. Indonesia and The Philippines both have LOTS of islands that might be suited to a ""special economic zone"". I think you canThe country that is closest in its mix might be Singapore.

Peter Thiel seems to think the ""next"" Silicon Valley may involve creation of floating cities like Milton's grandson, Patri Friedman wants to do. Indonesia and The Philippines both have LOTS of islands that might be suited to a ""special economic zone"". I think you can make the case the internet and distance education rapidly are making having institutions  Stanford and Berkeley right there less of a factor. What I have thought is that in general, the Asean countries really need to pull off something dramatic economically or risk becoming essentially a province of China. There may be motivation in that region to do something dramatic.The region in the US that may be poised to have another Silicon Valley like expansion is the Northwest. Amazon,Microsoft and a bunch of other tech companies are already there. If good high speed rail or a hyperloop line connected the major regional cities that would create an interesting environment. The Microsoft millionaires are plentiful and provide a block of angel capital. UW is not Stanford, but it is a major research institution.","112,404 followers",Yishan Wong,751,1.6K,28.7M,2016,https://www.quora.com/What-country-is-most-likely-to-see-a-Silicon-Valley-like-emergence-in-its-technology-industry

6,"Thermal infrared has much the same operating environment issues as cameras (and other short wavelength light sensors; lidar, for example)So my question is what could thermal ir give me that I don’t already have? Combine that with the cost of keeping the detectors themselves maintained (cooled), I don’t see these sensors as giving any more bang for the buck.","527,819 followers",Adam D'Angelo,1.1K,990,33.5M,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-country-is-most-likely-to-see-a-Silicon-Valley-like-emergence-in-its-technology-industry

9,"No, Learn what pays off, not everything which is thrown every now and then on your face like shit, we need to be more careful in picking what we need to learn rather than picking up every little new tech on the block as not every technology is for commercial advancement,","1,594 followers",Michael Van In,631,1.5K,2.9M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-country-is-most-likely-to-see-a-Silicon-Valley-like-emergence-in-its-technology-industry
