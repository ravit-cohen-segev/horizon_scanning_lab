5,"300 years from now? Well, be glad You and I won’t be alive by then. I say this because of the answer I’ll give.These are my thoughts.Let me introduce you to Sophia:Hey! Before I continue, I want you to meet theWhat does that say to you? Couldn’t she be the height of technology as we know it?Making her a citizen makes me think about the motive behind AI and the direction technology is going.The world is advancing to where technology will become autonomous. Which means humans are not required anymore. Almost like we are being replaced, right? What if that’s t300 years from now? Well, be glad You and I won’t be alive by then.

Which means humans are not required anymore. Almost like we are being replaced, right? What if that’s the case?Autonomous vehicles, machines, etc..You will agree with me that 300 years from now is more than enough to perfect Artificial Intelligence.Oh…are you hoping I will tell you about IoTThe World’s First Artificial Intelligence robot citizen “Sophia” may be a kind of ‘Adam’ for the robot generation.Also, with the advancement in technology, comes with a lot of negative effects as well. If I should guess what 300 years from now will be, I’m sorry, but all I can picture isArtificial Intelligence will be perfected by 300 years from now, with robots being able to detect that humans are killing their planet (Maybe). I should also mention that AI perfection will be the greatest technological achievement. That is where AI can not only think for itself, but also able to execute those thoughts. And they will also become autonomous to even write codes to create other robots.Humanity might become extinctI’ve watched movies about how robots turned on humans. But now I feel these movies are trying to pass a message.Watch the moviesIn conclusion, If you ask about technology in 5 to 30 years from now, I might mention some gadgets and stuff… but 300 years from now, this is what you get.",UNKNOWN,Sakshi Mohapatra,6.1K,0,0,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-will-be-the-greatest-technology-in-the-next-20-years

The early versions of touchscreens were at least six inches thick, had a wide frame around the screen, and would start malfunctioning if anyone touched it with a damp finger.

The early versions of touchscreens were at least six inches thick, had a wide frame around the screen, and would start malfunctioning if anyone touched it with a damp finger. Yet one of the first uses for these were in restaurants.Fifty years ago we did not have cellphones. Bag phones came onto the scene in the late eighties (larger than your laptop bag). It took almost 10 years to get them down to a easily-portable size and reliable enough to actually have an intelligible conversation without screaming.The idea that we could merge touch screen technology with cellphones... I don't know of anyone who was actually specualting about that until it happened.Sure,Currently, our rate of innovation is accelerating exponentially. If it continues, or even if shifts to a more geometric rate, what happens fifty years from now is completely outside our ability to imagine.My point is that predicting what will happen, technology-wise, in fifty years is useless.
