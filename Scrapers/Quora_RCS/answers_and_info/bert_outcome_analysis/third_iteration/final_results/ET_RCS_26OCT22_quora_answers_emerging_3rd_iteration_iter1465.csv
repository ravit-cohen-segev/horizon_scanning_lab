0,"Neither Hadoop nor Python is a career. Expertise in either might be a stepping stone to a great career, though.There is a huge and increasingly-important area of study with various names, meaning “extracting information from data”. Expertise with Hadoop is a great entry into that career area. Other areas that Hadoop experience can lead to include data management, large enterprise information systems, and database management.There is a similarly huge and very important area of study with various names, meaning “telling computers how to do something useful”—alternately, “software development”.

This framework is written using Scala language but can be invoked from Scala, Python as well as Java.Probably you want to learn data science but are confused with all the jargons thrown here and there.FirstIf volume of your data is small, you can easily solve it with Python or any other language like Go or Java.People recommend Python because learning curve of Python is easy. Also Python has a rich set of libraries dealing with data like numpy, scipy and scikit-learn. This doesn't mean you can do everything with it.Same goes with Java libraries. These libraries cannot deal with huge volumes of data. They will crash or hang or slow down to the point of insanity.In such situations, we need Hadoop. It runs on distributed environment and can easily scale to handle huge volumes of data.But, there is always aSo people came up with another framework named Spark, that can run on top of Hadoop.Spark internally uses Hadoop and yet provides relatively easy ways to program. By easy ways, I mean functions or methods or APIs. These methods handle all the minute details so that programmers can concentrate on core business logic. Spark can be invoked as a library from Python, Java and Scala.I hope I was able to clear few doubts of the readers.","3,227 followers",Vik Paruchuri,2.7K,0,0,2018,https://www.quora.com/Which-technology-is-better-to-learn-Hadoop-or-Python

I've tried to learn coding without context and application, and I've almost never come out of it with any meaningful skills.When I learned python 3 years ago, I wanted to create websites.  It shouldn't come as a shock to anyone that the best way to learn how to do this was to create websites.1.  Find what motivates youFinding and keeping your motivation is key -- I slept through a lot of the one high school programming class I took because it made us memorize a bunch of syntax.  On the other hand, when I needed to learn python to make an automated essay scoring algorithm, I stayed up many late nights learning and iterating.Motivation is rarely addressed in learning -- you're often just given a list of generic tutorials to try, and told to go do them.  But the great thing about python is that you can develop almost anything, from mobile apps to games to advanced machine learning algorithms.  No matter what you're interested in, you can probably build it in python, and there's probably a good getting started tutorial.Pick an area or two that you're interested in, and stick with them-- you'll be developing quite a few projects in the areas.Here are some sample areas, but feel free to add your own:2.  Learn some basic python syntaxUnless you know the basic syntax, it's hard to implement anything.  That said, don't spend too long on this.  The goal is to learn the very basics, so you know enough to start working on your own projects in your areas(s) of interest.For reference, I spent less than a week on codecademy, and went through about 30% of the material.  This was enough to get started on a project.Some resources that can help you:CodecademyI can't emphasize enough that you should only spend the minimum amount of upfront time possible on basic syntax.  The quicker you can get to working on projects, the faster you will learn.  You can always refer back to the syntax when you get stuck later.3.  Make structured projects in your chosen areaUnless you actually apply your knowledge, you won't be able to retain it well.  Projects are a great way to learn because they push your capabilities, show you how to apply skills, and give you a portfolio to show employers in the future.When you start out, it can be helpful to have more structured projects with some guidance.  Here are a few ideas:GamesWebsitesMobile appsData science4.  Work on projects on your ownOnce you have learned the concepts in a guided manner, it's time to work on some projects on your own.  You'll still need to consult references and look up concepts, but you'll be fitting what you learn into the needs of your project, not the other way around.Finding other people to work with here can both help you learn and help keep you motivated.Some ideas:My first project was adapting my automated essay scoring algorithm from R into python.  It didn't end up looking pretty, but it started me on the journey to learning python.The key is to pick something and do it.  If you get too hung up on picking the perfect project, there's a risk that you'll never make one.5.  Keep working on harder projectsKeep increasing the difficulty and scope of your projects.  If you're completely comfortable with what you're building, it means it's time to try something harder.Here are some ideas for when that time comes:Going forwardAt the end of the day, python is evolving and changing all the time.  There are probably only a few people who can legitimately claim to completely understand it.You'll need to be constantly learning and working on projects.  If you do this right, you'll find yourself looking back on your code from 6 months ago and thinking about how terrible it is.  If you get to this point, you're on the right track.Python is a really fun and rewarding language to learn, and I think anyone can get to a high level of proficiency in it if they find the right motivation.",179 followers,George Flanagin,599,167,900.3K,2015,https://www.quora.com/Which-technology-is-better-to-learn-Hadoop-or-Python

6,"Depends on what you mean by large. The really big ones like Facebook, Microsoft, Google, Apple, Samsung, etc, are too big to fail in that time period.

They have amassed huge economies of scale and infrastructure that serve as moats to keep smaller companies from effectively competing. They attract huge swaths of top talent from all walks of life from elite tech schools and business schools to senior executives and distinguished principal engineers from the other top companies out there. They can afford to pay the best and they know that A-players want to work with other A-players. These are the New York Yankees of tech. How can you beat that?Innovation. Sears used to be Amazon. You could buy freaking anything- clothes, tools, tractors, even houses off of the Sears catalog. Just wait 6–8 weeks for it to ship and it will come to your door, or you can come pick it up in your semi-retired conveniently located local store.K-Mart came in and ate a large slice of their pie by selling a smaller selection of fast moving goods at a discount (purchasing economy) and locating closer to customers.Then Wal-Mart came in with a superior supply chain strategy and was able to undercut k-Mart prices and offer more selection to boot.Then Amazon revolutionized the shopping world with free two day shipping and a selection of just about everything in the world.So what's next in retail? If Amazon keeps its eyes open, they have the talent and horsepower to stay King of the Hill. But if they get complacent, some other company will change the rules right out from under them and win the advantage. That's why at Amazon we talk a lot about how ""It's always day 1"" and we stay relentlessly focused on doing better for our customers.What about the others?Well Facebook bought some time by acquiring Instagram and copying the best parts of Snapchat (stories), but their core product isn't all that cool anymore.Apple hasn't done anything new in a while, and eventually people will stop getting so e...","45,630 followers",David Seidman,2K,3.6K,85.1M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Which-technology-is-better-to-learn-Hadoop-or-Python
9,"AI, particularly as exposed in public cloud APIs and on vehicles, will eliminate millions of mostly low to moderate wage jobs, from taxi drivers and auto body shops to hospital workers and administrators of all kinds.

It won't matter what language a movie or TV show was filmed in, because it will be automatically and seamlessly translated into every major language, including adjusting the video to match the audio.Fake video and audio will be so easy to create that only cutting edge technology will be able to tell the difference. As a result, big tech companies will have a dominant role in determining which information is considered true, much more even than today. People will not like that, so many will turn to literal fake news instead.Amazon will completely dominate every aspect of retail in the developed world, despite numerous attempts to regulate it, using an almost totally autonomous distribution network. Many factories will be effectively autonomous too. So in some cases, a product will go from raw materials to your doorstep without ever being touched by a human.

If it continues, or even if shifts to a more geometric rate, what happens fifty years from now is completely outside our ability to imagine.My point is that predicting what will happen, technology-wise, in fifty years is useless.
