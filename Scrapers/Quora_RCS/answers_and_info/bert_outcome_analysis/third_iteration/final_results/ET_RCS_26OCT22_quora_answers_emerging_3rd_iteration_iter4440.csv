0,Simple. It's a fair exchange if you want to access their market in return. You don't have to manufacture in China if you don't think they are worth it thus you don't have to transfer any technology to them. You could also manufacture in India or back home and export it back to China.

1,China never point gun on the CEO head. The companies are welcome to expand other place. It is just that the companies want to treat China like their backyard.

3,"What is forced technology transfer? The Chinese said that if you want to do business in China, you need to form a ‘joint venture’ where a Chinese company owns 51% of the JV. At the beginning all kinds of problems cropped up including out right theft. With time, things worked out, but for a JV to work using Chinese employees, it well night impossible to keep secrets, hence US complaints about forced technology transfer.

Tesla is the first American company to build a factory in China that doesn’t require a JV. It remains to be seen how Tesla does. What you find is that most under-developed countries use these techniques to develop their own viable domestic sectors. Foreign companies know this going in. In China’s case, the foreign companies saw a rising domestic market, dwarfing anything in their own country, hence they went in with their eyes open and complained all the way. They would prefer a monopoly but the Chinese didn’t want their domestic market overwhelmed with foreign companies, they wanted their own companies to be able to compete. Now that China is more mature and becoming self-sufficient, it is opening its markets even wider to encourage domestic competition.What you are about to see is the shoe on the other foot. For a long while, pundits said China only copies and had no innovative abilities. That has been changing over the last 5 years or so. As China grows and innovates, it will be interesting to see what the US will demand of Chinese companies if they want to enter the US market. Already, there are restrictions on Chinese companies entering the US market. There are technology restrictions and geographical restrictions. How much more, remains to be seen.",0 followers,Mitchell Geller,978,411,389.1K,2019,https://www.quora.com/Why-does-China-have-to-engage-in-a-forced-technology-transfer
4,"No. Notice that the US government has not presented one shred of evidence. Why???The US government has publicly announced its allegation, and we, the public, are expected to take it at its word. Why should we???The US government has a long record of lying about China over the past several years. China is blamed forEverything China does is evil and wrong. China is as bad as North Korea is, as bad as the Soviet Union was.We in the West",UNKNOWN,Bill Yu Liao (廖彧),650,138,1.9M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Why-does-China-have-to-engage-in-a-forced-technology-transfer
5,"When my son and I visited China in the year 2000 part of our tour was to the then-under construction Three Gorges Dam. The project was of particular interest to we Canadians because China had bought two massive electrical generators to install in the dam.

This does not meet the definition of “stealing” but seems to be a very shrewd business practice that benefits China for the long term future.","68,796 followers",Kanthaswamy Balasubramaniam,898,17.3K,413.6M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Why-does-China-have-to-engage-in-a-forced-technology-transfer
