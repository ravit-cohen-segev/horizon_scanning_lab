How can you hold parents responsible for issues that are only able to be diagnosed well after the child is born?The answer is that there is really no such thing as a disability, and there is no such thing as a “normal” child. We are all born with different strengths, weaknesses, and abilities. To expect us all to fit into someone’s bland definition of how we should all be designed, behave, and think, is foolish at best.","87,313 followers",Shefali Naidu,3.2K,822,50M,2019,https://www.quora.com/I-m-only-14-but-why-am-I-being-blamed-for-my-parents-failing-to-communicate-their-issues-with-one-another

I’m going to answer the question of why isn’t all software development outsourced.I have a friend who is in the process of starting a business.

She hired developers in Nigeria to code up the web site, which she had designed.They came out with the beta version, which had some bugs, but it was largely working and showed promise. Then her developers quit. Something better came along, and why should they have any loyalty to her? People generally don’t when you’re paying bottom dollar.She hired new developers to finish the project. Of course they had to come up to speed with the code, which took time, and then they had to fix the bugs which took more time. It turns out they were actually lying to her about how much they were getting done. Ultimately they got nothing done, and she had to fire them. They just cost her time and money.She hired the third set of developers. As far as I know, they are working out. But her website has been in beta with unfixed bugs for a year and a half, and her customers are not happy with that.Sometimes cost isn’t the most import thing. Sometimes schedule is more important. If you’re in business, sometimes all that matters is to be first. If she had competition in her market, having a year and a half delay would have killed her business.If you’re working with remote developers, particularly ones who are in a significantly different time zone, it slows down the work. You can’t be in a room with them brain storming. You can never get anything faster than tomorrow. If you have to exchange 10 emails to get something done, it’s going to take a week. You also can’t sit on top of people and make sure they get the work done.Sometimes all of that is fine. If you have a self contained project and it doesn’t really matter when it is finished, ship it off to someone who can do it for cheap. If your business or business unit is going to fail if the software isn’t done on time, you’re going to want to be able to interact with your programmers personally.","68,811 followers",Kanthaswamy Balasubramaniam,851,17.3K,413.9M,2016,https://www.quora.com/I-m-only-14-but-why-am-I-being-blamed-for-my-parents-failing-to-communicate-their-issues-with-one-another

11,"First of all, you’re really asking about the location of the software developer, not their nationality.

There are laws in western countries to prohibit paying people differently based on their nationality. So your question is: why do companies in rich Western countries pay $100 per hour to software developers in their own country instead of hiring software developers in India for much lower wages?For the purposes of this discussion, let’s differentiate betweenYou certainly can outsource work if all you need is, say, a WordPress site with particular visual elements and you want it built at low cost. If software is your core business, or you need a software product of high complexity, then outsourcing is unlikely to yield good results; it does not matter whether you outsource to India or to a local firm. To get a high quality product of high complexity, you need the ability to carefully vet the person who is going to be working on it, and you need them to be tightly integrated with the team that needs the product.So, you can hire full-time employees in India, and you can, indeed, pay them much less than you would pay someone who is located in, say, the US. Google and Microsoft, for example, employ many software engineers in Hyderabad. There are reasons, however, why they don’t try to have the majority of their workforce in India (and since there are more than 1 billion people in India, lack of talent is not the reason). Two main problems. One is the communication barrier, which is due to the language barrier, time differences, and, to some extent that is hard to quantify, cultural differences in communication. The other problem is that since people in India who speak English well enough to be part of an American team know that they would get paid much more in the US, you are going to be competing against other employers who also want to hire the same people as you for their talent and their English skills—and who need their services so badly that they are willing to sponsor a visa for them to come to the US. So now, you can no longer keep paying that person wages based on the Indian market.Why do people pay $100 per hour to a Western software developer when they can pay $20 for an Indian with the same skill/experience?","83,132 followers",Anna Sharudenko,13.3K,199,26.9M,2010,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-issues-on-Local-and-Global-Communication-In-Multicultural-Settings-Nation-and-Culture

As a result, while a difference in hourly rate persists, it is nowhere close to 5:1. When the differential is more like 1.3:1, factors such as time zone difference, on-site presence and team fit become much more critical to project success, and often trump the small cost advantage.Companies select engineers for the value they can generate within a team. A high-performing team requires a mix of experienced (and expensive, wherever they are) engineers and more junior people who are still learning their craft. The team needs to understand business context and requirements.There are outstanding engineers everywhere. Most of them aren’t on the freelance platforms in my experience. Those platforms are great for small, self-contained projects needing one or two people where complexity is low, but they are not the place where you will find, say, an experienced embedded engineer with a good understanding of security who can fit quickly into an existing team.Finally, you should never underestimate the effort involved in running an outsourced project. I have worked with very good outsourced teams in the past, and it has always taken significantly more of my time than was ever planned. I stress again, this was an experienced high quality outsourcing partner. There was business value to the project, and I would do it again, but only in the right circumstances.I don’t want to think about how much of my time would be taken trying to manage a team of unproven young developers on an outsourcing platform just because they are cheap.In short, as in so much in life, you get what you pay for.",0 followers,Mika Timonen,876,5.3K,1.6M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-issues-on-Local-and-Global-Communication-In-Multicultural-Settings-Nation-and-Culture

That man would rather die from not getting what he needs from his beloved than to cheat. It is what love does, Love would rather suffer than bring suffering to its beloved.If my wife is no longer pleasing to me it is because I have lost focus. I no longer looked and focused on her but I started looking sideways, This way I got sidetracked by what is on the side. Then I myself created competition for her. Because no one is truly perfect I started seeing the things which she does not have and the other woman. Then because she is new and I focus on her all her good points become enlarged, This is not because she is better in any way. It is just that I am focusing on her. The focus that should have been on my wife is on her. But because my wife is my wife and she has been with me for long I want to keep her around. Then use the mistress as a fun thing and also use my wife as my back up. True love cannot be that selfish.Do you see that? Every woman is truly beautiful and every man is truly wonderful only if their spouses would focus on them and stop looking sideways at the distractions. Then the relationship would last forever. This is why all men who have truly loved their wives believed their wives are the best women in the world, This is because all they see is their wives because of their focus. When they think of a woman they think of their wives. Their wives become the very symbol of what a woman is. Because their eyes and efforts in life are completely on their wives. They have no side shows or side dishes. Their wives are the very center of all their focus and they dedicate their lives to bringing joy to their wives. How would they know about other women if they never even look at them? Do you see?Let us stop promoting what is destructive and teach what is constructive. A man cannot love two women at once. He will always be using both to fulfill his desires. Man must focus on the wives they have married and look only to them without starring sideways like a donkey with those things that they put on the side of its eyes. This donkey will keep on the road without any distraction.A man who has a mistress has either never loved his wife or is losing focus on his wife thus creating competition for her by the distractions. It is either one of the two. It is never that he needs both or love both, That is just irrational reasoning to fulfill one’s selfish desires.
