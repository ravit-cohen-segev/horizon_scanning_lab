0,"No, and in fact, quite the contrary. Humans have now quite considerably “devolved” as a direct result of technology. By “devolved” I mean become less sustainable and less biologically secure.Humanity has now become substantially genetically impaired by technology and is now streaming into a mass extinction event as a direct outcome.Our planet has now been compelled into a magnetic collapse situation that will destroy the capacity to continue this technological mutation unless major understandings about technology are implemented within the next few years.","220,613 followers",Franklin Veaux,1.8K,47.3K,782.9M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Does-the-considerable-advancement-of-technology-mean-that-humans-have-actually-evolved

2,"I don't really think so. We have certainly changed our behavior.

There is nothing else we can achieve through our egos, all our social, political, economic systems are defaulting, falling apart while in sciences we also reached a limit we cannot go beyond with our inherent consciousness, perception of reality.We are at a unique threshold beyond which a completely different evolution awaits. We are obligated by Nature’s evolutionary plan to use our unique human intellect that is capable of critical self-assessment and initiating self-change. With its help, also drawing help on ourselves from Nature’s evolution we can finally start a conscious evolution - above, outside of the sphere of the selfish, subjective, individualistic ego.We are on our way to becoming Nature’s only conscious, fully integrated at the same time independent observers, witnesses, partners by building an unprecedented, totally selfless, altruistic, mutually responsible, and mutually complementing human superorganism with a collective consciousness, collective intellect.The breakthrough technology for this developmental path is the technology of mutual connection between human beings, learning and implementing between us how Nature’s elements, the cells of our own biological bodies interconnect in order to give life to that higher, collective consciousness that equals Nature.","105,669 followers",Dave Consiglio,742,6.8K,91.6M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Does-the-considerable-advancement-of-technology-mean-that-humans-have-actually-evolved

8,"If someone can describe a method to “evolve our gene pool” I will be fascinated, if also skeptical.Of course we have been in a race to grow/improve/expand our technology since the beginning of human civilization.

When the total is six billion nucleotides, fifty is about on the scale of belly button lint with regard to normal health.But from the initial fertilized egg out to the germ cell (egg or sperm) that initiates a new generation, a lot of cell divisions take place. On the good side, this is evolution in the flesh, unstoppable. Species adapt to whatever environment they live in, and over time if the environment doesn’t change, the ability of a “good” mutation to spread throughout the gene pool becomes less and less.When the environment changes, and over hundred-thousand to many-million year spans, count on that happening, that fuzz effect of cell division allows for necessary changes to sweep through the breeding population.But keeping bad genes in the pool poses inevitable long term challenges.","220,613 followers",Franklin Veaux,1.8K,47.3K,782.9M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Does-the-considerable-advancement-of-technology-mean-that-humans-have-actually-evolved
9,"Yes.Evolution operates on populations of memes, which is to say units of information.

Our genes are just one type of meme, encoded in DNA.All of our technologies, which range from smartphones and nuclear reactors and clothes to more abstract things like language and the concept of privacy, are also memes.Each technological idea is its own species of meme, and just as we rely on symbiotic relationships with mitochondria and gut bacteria and the like to live, we rely on symbiotic relationships with our technologies.One particularly useful property of our technology is that we can selectively breed and thereby evolve memes much, much faster by not encoding them in DNA, but instead in arrangements of neurons and ink on paper and electrical charges in silicon.One of the main reasons for this, one of the reasons symbiosis is so critical, is, simply, that evolution applies to populations across generations, and the shorter the generations the faster evolution can work. Humans, alas, have some of the longest generations on the planet to as to better reap the benefits of out symbioses.It took billions of years for DNA to evolve intelligent life.

14,"It wouldn't have. In fact modern human hands evolved among our ancestors millions of years before our brains did. You could say our brains evolved to make fuller use of the possibilities afforded by our hands.Gibbons, our most distant Great Ape cousins, lack opposable thumbs because they're get in the way of swinging through the forest canopy. Conversely, we need thumbs to hold/throw/manipulate objects--all prerequisites to making and employing weapons that can act at a distance (rocks, throwing spears, atlatls, bows/arrows)",3 followers,Samuel Bateman,1.1K,102,56.2K,2015,https://www.quora.com/Does-the-considerable-advancement-of-technology-mean-that-humans-have-actually-evolved
15,"Even before tool use, our ancestors were probably the best in the animal kingdom at throwing things, which also benefits from an opposable thumb.  So overall, I think it is unlikely humans would have split off from our ape brethren in the way they did, without the thumb.  They may have never successfully moved into the savannah, and instead remained in the forests and never split from the chimps.
