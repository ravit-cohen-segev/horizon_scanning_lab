It all started in World War Two.US Intelligence was a dump but rather than ask help from the British (it was offered), the US tried on its own … and failed spectacularly.The problem was that once an agency was created and got certain responsibilities, it was politically impossible to change its scope, even if they were incompetent.The result was always the creation of yet another agency to compensate for the failure of the previous ones.And of course, there was fighting between various government departments as to who got certain responsibilities (and a kick-arse budget).Needless to say, the system doesn’t work, it never did. US Intelligence is not just notoriously bad, it is also highly politicized.Saying what politicians want to hear increases your budget, so the actual reports at the highest level bear little relationship to the truth.In 1958, the CIA was asked how many ICBMs the Soviets had. after detailed investigations, the initial report said 4.But the CIA could use assets from Strategic Air Command for free and SAC wanted to push through the Minuteman ICBM programme.So when Congress asked the CIA how many ICBMs the Soviets had, they bluntly said 1,000.This increased the SAC budget which in turn increased the assets SAC could give to the CIA.the US Intelligence Community is seen the world over as the best example of how NOT to gather intelligence.",17 followers,Daniel Johnson,5.8K,128,514.2K,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-top-Italian-technology-startup-blogs

They then, instead, were brought to a US transport plane which flew them to the US. The crates were opened, the plane was meticulously assembled, and then disguised with USAF decaling so it could be plausibly passed off as an experimental prototype if it were seen.A USAF pilot then spent two or three weeks taking the plane through its paces, with other aircraft pacing and otherwise helping evaluate what the Yak could and could not do. Once they had all the data they wanted, the plane was stripped of the fake markings, disassembled, cleaned, and put back into its shipping crates just as meticulously as it had been removed.The crates were flown back to Eastern Europe and inserted right back into the freight yard where they’d been stored, with no one (outside of the Yugoslavians who were aiding the operation) the wiser that they had been gone for a full month.Air Force Magazine",0 followers,Harry Cooper,773,2.4K,1M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Which-is-the-top-agency-the-CIA-or-NSA-in-terms-of-technology-funding-job-satisfaction-number-of-secret-operations-etc-Is-it-really-as-shown-in-the-movies

6,"The answers are:It is well-known that Elon Musk went to Stanford Univ. to pursue his PhD in Supercapacitors in 1995, and dropped out after 2-days to start the Zip2 web software company.The answers are:It is well-known that Elon Musk went to Stanford Univ. to pursue his PhD in Supercapacitors in 1995, and dropped out after 2-days to start the Zip2 web software company. Better materials for supercaps like carbon nanotubes and graphene were not available in 1995, so he made the right choice.At a Cleantech forum in San Francisco on 16 March 2011, Musk said: ""If I were to make a prediction, I’d think there's a good chance that it is not batteries, but capacitors.” Elon Musk already knew to store electrons directly as opposed to chemically is a better solution for EVs than chemical batteries.Supercapacitors (NEC trade name) do not involve ions running back-n-forth between the two electrodes, so there’s no internal wear-n-tear (and growing dendrites). The electrical charges stay on one side of the electrode and go out to the load when it’s playtime. Conventional supercapacitors (6–8 Wh/kg) have 500K-1M cycle-life. The weak link in supercapacitor cycle-life is the organic electrolyte; it breaks down, in time and in heat. At 3V, it can short out, so they usually recommend to charge the cells up to 2.75V.Ultracapacitors (Maxwell’s trade name) have been in the 6–8 Wh/kg class, so let’s hope Maxwell has something much better on the horizon. Supercapacitors typically have a thin coating of activated carbon on the current collector; around 1,500 m2/g, and then a liquid electrolyte is vacuum injected into the rolled-up cells after they are in their cans. In some cases, the electrolyte is applied before being rolled.Recent R&D lab tests around the world have shown 50–70 Wh/kg specific-energy for supercaps using graphene. When I met with Maxwell R&D many years ago, we were talking about using carbon nanotubes, since graphene wasn’t available yet. New forms of graphene will perform even better than carbon nanotubes, today.Since Tesla’s NCA Li-ion chemistry is around 250 Wh/kg, even Ultracaps may not be that good at this time using conventional graphene. Supercaps have a much higher charge-leak or self-discharge rate than Li-ion chemistries. So, you may not want a full supercap power pack for your EV if you park it for more than 1–2 weeks at a time (e.g. airport). That issue may be improved with a solid electrolyte.If an EV power pack has around 10–15% supercaps, and the rest as NCA, then the NCA will likely have a much longer service life. The reason is the high current drain for acceleration and high current input from brake-regen can be buffered by the supercaps. The NCA pack can sit back and enjoy the slower current drain from cruising.Let’s do an example assuming 500V as the pack voltage. When supercharging, the supercaps can receive 100C or more, but the charger conductors get too large and heavy. So, let’s use 20C, for now. A 15 kWh supercap pack can be fully charged in 3-minutes at 20C (500V, 600A). During that 3-minutes, the NCA pack can also be charged at the 1C rate that NCA is more comfortable with (500V, 170A); that’s about 4.25 kWh.If you have more time, and no one is on line behind you, then you can charge up the NCA pack more. If you’re in a hurry, then the 15 kWh in the supercap pack and the 4 kWh in the NCA pack should get you another 50-miles, not including any regen coming back to the packs. You can program the supercap pack to slowly recharge the NCA pack as you drive if it has room. This way, when you get to the next charging station, you can top-off the supercap pack again; but, most likely you’re already home by then.For vehicles that do long drives (trucks) or a known routes each day (urban delivery vehicles), then a 90% supercap pack will make more sense. These vehicles can be charged before they need to leave. Truck stops can install high current chargers to fully charge a truck in less than 10-min. The urban delivery vehicles can drain their supercap packs into a supercap bank at the depot for use the next day.If EVs were designed to have modular power packs like eScooters, then the owner can slide in extra packs of Li-ion cells or supercaps for longer trips that day. You can do that up to the point of diminishing returns in weight, volume, and mileage. These packs can sit in their charger cradles in the garage or in your apartment (flat).ADDENDUM (8 March 2019)I forgot to mention the graphene supercaps in the labs may not include the weight of the cell packaging materials and metal current collectors. So, the labs that reported 50–70 Wh/kg said the current collector metal sheets were included in their numbers, then fully packaged supercaps might be around 25–35 Wh/kg. However, one lab has even reported 350 Wh/kg (active materials only) or 88 Wh/kg with commercial packaging. Will advise once I have confirmation from the labs.","1,983 followers",Ira J Perlow,730,2.8K,4.5M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Which-is-the-top-agency-the-CIA-or-NSA-in-terms-of-technology-funding-job-satisfaction-number-of-secret-operations-etc-Is-it-really-as-shown-in-the-movies
7,"Panasonic and LG Chem…but, while true, that’s a VERY misleading answer.In the USA, Tesla’s batteries are made within their own GigaFactory - they lease space to Panasonic who actually manufactures the battery cells there and sells the battery cells exclusively to Tesla. The battery cells literally come off of the Panasonic production line - and on to the Tesla battery pack assembly line. They share technology with Tesla.In China it is a similar deal: LG Chem produces batteries for Tesla right there, inside the GigaFactory in Shanghai.I would expect the same thing to happen in the future BerlinPanasonic and LG Chem…but, while true, that’s a VERY misleading answer.In the USA, Tesla’s batteries are made within their own GigaFactory - they lease space to Panasonic who actually manufactures the battery cells there and sells the battery cells exclusively to Tesla.

So Tesla will soon own the technology, the factory space and the ability to monopolize the equipment to make batteries. This could be extremely bad news for battery manufacturers.Note that at the recent Earnings call meeting they said that the semi-truck is stalled from manufacturing because they can’t turn out batteries fast enough - and that the bulk energy storage business is huge and growing.When Elon Musk sees a bottleneck - he attacks it with Piranha-like viciousness.Batteries are a bottleneck. I’d bet that Panasonic will be in trouble as soon as their present agreement expires. LG Chem might survive longer because of deals signed with the Chinese government.Tesla will become a battery manufacturer who incidentally makes cars…and probably very soon.",UNKNOWN,John A.

8,"There are two trains of thought I have in answer to this question. The first is to say that no other electric car maker is getting more range out of their cars than Tesla does as far I can see from the data. That suggests that Tesla batteries are at least the equal of any other maker, but also they make use of their batteries very efficiently.The other is that Tesla’s battery technology has, up to now, made use of commodity form factor cells produced in cooperation with established makers of those types of cells but Tesla has them made with their own proprietary formulations.

The construction of their packs and the integration into their cars is better than most other auto making companies. They do this without violating patents that those other companies may own.Tesla only now is beginning to push away from what most other traction battery companies have been selling specifically to auto manufacturers, while having their own R&D work to surpass the efforts of most of them. Needless to say, almost all makers of both the batteries intended for automobiles, and the makers thereof, have struggled to equal what Tesla has managed to do so far.I do think that the apparent reticence of Toyota to compete with Tesla in BEVs comes about through Toyota’s reliance upon patent superiority where electric traction is concerned. They still have the simplest hybrid system and its manufacturing experience which causes them to stay with that type of vehicle, while probably having a patentable battery improvement in the works that could potentially leap frog Tesla. ‘Sour grapes’ is heard from their publicity department about BEVs, until they can once again dominate the market, if they can. Tesla probably is also working on similar improvements as are some others. It currently is a battle to bring costs down, and several companies including VW are getting good at that. Tesla is just far ahead in the process of mass producing the best of current technology, where the other makers well into the EV paradigm shift have been slow to realize just how much ahead on cost Tesla is today.",2 followers,Richard Muller,829,2.3K,202.3M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Which-is-the-top-agency-the-CIA-or-NSA-in-terms-of-technology-funding-job-satisfaction-number-of-secret-operations-etc-Is-it-really-as-shown-in-the-movies
