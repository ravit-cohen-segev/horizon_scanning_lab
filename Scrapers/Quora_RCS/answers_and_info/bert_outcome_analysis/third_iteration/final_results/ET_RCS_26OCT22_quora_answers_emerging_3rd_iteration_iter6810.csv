Make it sound like we need to prepare for it because the technology will be shifting and therefore core skills will be shifting or something.So I did a presentation in 1998 where I discussed massively cored processors requiring new language and parallel skills the like of which the industry, even High Performance Computing has not seen. I discussed the shift of the GPU to compete against large scale computing clusters. And finally I talked about ray-tracing on the GPU arriving somewhere on the scale of 15–20 years. In order to get there, we had to go through the other technologies. We had to have programs loaded onto the GPU to speed up the processes: new languages, new techniques.This means a complete revolution in computer graphics over 20 years that nothing would be recognizable compared to the graphics of “today.” (back then)In 1999 the core splits on the GPU began. They were simple shared function splits. In 2001 the GeForce 3 introduced shading languages and programmability to the GPU.

People built bridges before the Enlightenment, but if they tried to build one differently than the ones that were already up, there was a good chance it would fall down.  But with the physics to understand materials and the math to manipulate the physics, you could design a different kind of bridge that you knew in advance would not fall down.There were ingenious technologies and great technical achievements before the Enlightenment, but until this current tick of human history, there was never a large and growing and accessible body of theory to enable new technology.",269 followers,Karthik Reddy L,16K,0,0,2016,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-mind-blowing-facts-depicting-how-computer-technology-has-evolved-tremendously-in-relatively-short-span-of-time

The invention of technology has always been a group effort, requiring the work of many. All the technology we see today is the result of incremental improvement of past technologies by humans working together. So where does this notion of the lone hero genius inventor come from?It comes from a historical tradition; in the West, starting with the Greeks and Prometheus, who is said to have been a Titan, one of the twelve children of the primordial parents Uranus (Sky) and his mother, Gaia (Earth).The story goes that Prometheus stole fire from the rest of the Titanic gods, brought it to humanity, and was punished for his generosity by being chained to a rock and having an eagle come daily to peck out his liver and eat it. His liver would magically regenerate in the evening, and the whole cycle would be repeated the next day, one assumes, for eternity.In the Western classical tradition, Prometheus became a figure who represented human striving, particularly the quest for scientific knowledge, and the risk of overreaching or unintended consequences. In particular, he was regarded in the Romantic era as embodying the lone genius whose efforts to improve human existence could also result in tragedy: Mary Shelley, for instance, gave The Modern Prometheus as the subtitle to her novel Frankenstein.Let’s look at that first, original technology: fire, without which no other subsequent technologies would have been possible.Fire was not invented by some lone genius; had that been the case, humanity would have died out long before even reaching the stage of Homo erectus, much less Homo sapiens.The discovery of fire (note the word “discovery”, rather than “invention”) was probably a fortuitous stroke of luck. Lightning had probably struck some trees and set them on fire, and a group of curious humans noted its warmth, and its capacity to turn darkness into light, and how much better the burnt, cooked animals who were unfortunate enough to cross its path tasted (and were more nutritious and easier to digest).The discovery of fire was a group effort; so was the capacity to create it, rather than just stumble upon it fortuitously.The ability to make fire was discovered separately, many times, by many different species of humans over eons of time over the entire globe. Many different methods were invented, such as rubbing a stick against a platform of wood, creating friction and heat, which would set fire to dry moss or grasses. Other technologies employed nothing more complex than flint banged against other rocks, causing sparks which could then set alight kindling. Over the millennia, the technology has not changed much; a butane lighter produces flame by scratching metal against ferrocerium, the modern-day version of flint, igniting pressurized butane gas.Bringing us up to the present, one of the greatest inventors in history, Thomas Edison, at one point had hundreds of scientists and engineers working for him on various projects in teams; do you really think he invented the gramophone, the light bulb, and the telegraph all by himself?Edison, in fact, invented none of these technologies; most of them already existed and had been invented some time before by others. Edison merely improved them and made them commercially viable, and he needed a veritable army of engineers and scientists to do so.If you really want to talk about a “lone genius,” Nikola Tesla would be most appropriate, since he worked mostly alone, with perhaps an assistant or two, and came up with some truly original technologies, the A\C induction motor among them (which had already been invented by someone else, so even THAT is not a technology sui generis).The invention of technology is and has always been a group effort from the beginning. The idea of the lone genius is politely called a “myth.”A better, perhaps more vulgar, but more accurate term, would be “bullshit.”",UNKNOWN,Colleen Farrelly,658,18.7K,50.9M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-mind-blowing-facts-depicting-how-computer-technology-has-evolved-tremendously-in-relatively-short-span-of-time
