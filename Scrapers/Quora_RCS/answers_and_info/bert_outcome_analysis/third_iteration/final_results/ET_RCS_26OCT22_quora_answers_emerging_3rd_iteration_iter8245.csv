Additionally, a petaflop can be measured asIf we filled Burj Khalifa’s 200-plus-storey floor space (equivalent to roughly 334,000 m²) with Summit supercomputers, that would be… a lot! Going by Math alone without any other considerations, roughly 397 Summits will fit in that space, equipped with around 149 million cores and a whopping 59 thousand petaflops (or 59 exaflops [Honestly, I have no idea why anyone would need a supercomputer that big, since the trend with computing has always been to miniaturize.Anyway, the smallest planet in our solar system is Mercury, with a radius of 2,439.7 km. So, before we can build a computer as big as a planet, the first hurdle we have to surmount is how to build a super-collosal-big-fat-boss-skyscraper 2,500 km high. Considering that the tallest building in the world right now is not even a kilometer high, this is a tall order. Probably, the best option would be to construct in space.Next is where to get the materials. We might need to mine a terrestrial planet or several moons and asteroids, and for that, we will require advanced space transport technology to quickly ferry materials between planets (without waiting for months or years for each trip), advanced robotics and artificial intelligence technologies to perform autonomous space mining, advanced life support systems for people if required, and so on, and so forth. Humans have not even gone beyond the Moon yet, so we are still decades behind these required technologies.Then, we have to consider a perpetual energy source that could power the entire planetary computer consistently and indefinitely. Nuclear fusion energy? Perhaps, but I believe we are still decades away from building a commercial fusion reactor.At our current technological level, such a concept can only be imagined in science fiction or computer games.I cannot even imagine how much such an enterprise would cost, and if the world has enough spare money to fund it.And for what purpose? What could we possibly need that many FLOPS for?On the other hand, if we diverted the ginormous funds required for such a colossal undertaking to educate the 7.7 billion humans on Earth - to grant scholarships to all so each one can get one or two PhDs…Or, provide enough food for everyone so that nobody sleeps hungry ever…Or, find cures to cancer, Alzheimers, AIDS, COVID-19, or any other deadly disease that might emerge in the future…Or, since we’re dabbling in science fiction anyway, develop technologies to interconnect the human brain to the Internet and to each other, so we can achieve a planet-wide computer network at a fraction of the cost…Then the world would be a far greater place.Sources:",0 followers,Jared Cooke,2.9K,97,1.2M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Can-a-computer-be-built-as-big-as-a-planet

But i’ll reiterate.This statement is downplaying the Flash horribly. ONLY a hundred? take this page from DCeasedHow about the entire world dead within minutes. Considering the only ones that can “catch” or even “react” to The Flash is probably only Superman and Wonder Woman. what if he actively just avoid them while killing the rest. Yes maybe they can defeat him in a fight. the question is can they “Stop” him?-Don’t know much about Cyborg, sorry.-This happenedSuffice to say he’s a threat.Wonder Woman is always shown to be not as powerful as Superman, but what people usually forgot is that she tends to punch over her weight limitShe dont need to withstand the omega sanction since her bracelet deflects EVERYTHINGShe is the God of War, She is a warrior with far more experience compared to any and all of the Justice League.And returning to the contingency planThis might be hard to swallow. But Batman has admitted that Wonder Woman has no kryptonite. and there is no one in the whole League that can stop her other than Superman, not Flash, not MM, not Shazam. Superman. and it’s only because he outrank her in almost every capabilities. Even that’s not a 100% win because of reasons mentioned above. Wonder Woman resists magic, Wonder Woman can react to the Flash. so the only way to defeat her is to match her in combat. that’s it.After mentioning all these.I’m sure some of you, if not most of you are familiar to Batman’s or The Flash. But how many of you knows about the rest of the league?Every single ones of the league are/ should be seen as a threat. they are all world-ending threats. but they are all not as obvious/ more subtle then Superman.That’s why Superman is seen as “the” threat. his abilities aren’t subtle. his prowess, strength, invulnerability, speed and everything is obvious. The only thing that isn’t obvious is his intelligence. And that’s also why everyone in the league fears and respect him.

By then, the produce section had been prepped for the following day and the sprinklers were turned out. The bakery and meat counters were closed (8:30 — both were union jobs). In short, the store was clearly “closed” when the manager would make his “please bring all purchases to the checkout” at 9:00.Since I always did Friday closing, I and a junior cashier along with the manager and the courtesy booth employee were stuck there. I got something like $2.10/hour back then, so the whopping $1.05 extra pay wasn’t worth it. (Also either my mom or my girlfriend would be sitting in the parking lot waiting.) But she’d take her time and it was the norm to be out around 9:30.Until one night. A senior cashier had agreed to sit in for a junior. The difference was this. The baggers (me), stockers, courtesy booth staff all worked between 4 and 7.5 hours. That was a clever scheduling technique to ensure no OT if a customer lingered at closing time. But this night, a senior was on and they always got 40 hours.That combined with the woman not leaving until 9:52 (I remember it to this day). I of course got my $2.10 (5 hours instead of 4). But the courtesy booth woman got a half hour OT as I recall. The senior cashier — on OT at 9:01 and she’d been with the store for many years.“Downtown” exploded when they saw that week’s payroll.

He came in to my office flustered; I walked with him to her cube talk to her. I asked what did you mean “you’re black”? She said “I am busy, he needs to be patient, I have my day planned, and I do not have time to talk to a black man that thinks he is my supervisor.” Now I was compelled to take her to HR. I said, “Get up and come with me- we need to go to HR right now”. She said “No did you not understand I am busy; I have lots of work and you’re messing up my plans.”I headed up to HR, went straight to the VP Dan, and let him know we have a problem.

We went back down to claims; he walked up to her and stood by ‘til she hung up the phone, “Connie what's this I hear about you refusing to meet with Al to talk about his new position?” She looked up and said, “Now look here buster, I have made it quite clear, I am busy, all of you have now messed up my day, and I don't work for no black guy. You need to clear this up right now before you piss me off.” Dan nodded me off and pointed to my office.We closed the door and he said “She is gone; I have never fired someone on the spot but she is nuts and I want her out of here.” Although he did not need it he was looking for me to agree and back him up as firing anyone required a written warning first unless there was imminent aggression or open hostility. That was written company policy. I agreed.We walked back to her desk. Dan said, “Connie get your personal items and follow me to the door; you’re fired.” She said “Look here buster; I have work to do, calls to return, checks to issue, and I do not have time for this nonsense, it is not funny, you can not fire me without a warning, now leave me alone.” Dan said “Connie stand up now; you are fired; I am walking you out now.” She gave him a dirty look and started to make a call. He leaned into take the phone from her hand and she slapped his hand away. He nodded to my office again. We walked over, he grabbed my phone and called the local Sheriff’s office. He asked if they could send over a unit to remove an employee.The deputies rolled up about 10 minutes later; we met them at the front door. They were amused at our request: a couple of wimps in suits that can’t fire a chick. They walked up to her cube, “Ma’am you need to come with us; we understand you have been asked to leave.” She responded with “Look boys- they can not fire me without a warning; you are not needed here; both of you need to trot on back to the doughnut shop.” They got real stiff, took up their commanding presence stature, and switched to their command voice, “Please stand up and place your arms behind your back, NOW!” She just smiled and started to make another call. The two of them lifted her out of her chair, phone still in hand, the cord dragging shit off of her desk. They spun her around and had cuffs on her in a split second. Her feet never hit the floor all the way to the patrol car. One officer came back, “We will hold her for a few hours and cut her loose unless you want to press charges for trespassing.” “No, no charges”.So the story should end - nope. The next morning 8:00AM she walks in with some others as she left her door card when we had her removed. Al sees her and runs to my office. She sits at her desk and tries to log in. I am already calling the Sheriff’s office. I clear the floor and lock the doors. I meet the same two deputies at the door; they were there fast. One pulls his stun gun while the other takes point. She is still trying to log in when the point man walks up, grabs her, and spins her to the floor, knee in the back, cuffs on, and reads her Miranda. They march her out; she is screaming “I have work to do.” I follow. At the car they let me know she was rather nasty when they took her in yesterday. Now she was on her way to the psych ward.

On the other hand it has so many good tools for simulation. Simulink is widely used for simulations of circuits,machine or even for hyperloop. So, if your purpose is to simulate your project or you want to do such thing then go for matlab.Personally, I would recommend python to anyone. First , learn python and may be your will be satisfied with its use for your tasks.

You can get a lot of similar functionality from Python that you’ll find in basic MATLAB, but not all the same, or as well implemented, or as thoroughly documented. Be weary of the evangelists who preach conversion without the full story.Python only begins to resemble MATLAB’s capabilities once you’re using the four third party libraries needed for serious scientific computing: Numpy, Scipy, Matplotlib, and Pandas. These primarily give you the functionality of ‘vanilla’ MATLAB plus a few other things, but they’re less elegant, and syntactically less powerful. This gets you halfway there. For scientific computing you need a good development environment that’s more than a simple text editor. You’ll need to find a suitable IDE. This means using Spyder. Luckily, Spyder comes with the above mentioned libraries. Now you’re almost replicating the scientific computing capabilities of basic MATLAB.Once you start using the additional toolboxes in MATLAB or its more advanced computing features, Python’s ability to match MATLAB in scientific computing begins to recede. Those who say it’s a sufficient replacement are generally not familiar with the extent of MATLAB’s features or abilities or continuous developments. Generally they’re not doing particularly advanced scientific work that requires these kinds of features. Many engineers, for example, prefer to use Python because they’re not doing deep-dives into the technical guts behind numerical modeling and computation, they’re scripting up portable solutions to get things working fast.That said, the most attractive thing about Python is that it’s free. If you’re not using advanced or added-on MATLAB features and prefer a less mathematically inclined language, or are funding your own work without the benefit of an employer, then using a free alternative is wise. If I had to buy all my own tools for my work, I’d use only Python and C++ (and maybe a little FORTRAN) 100% of the time. Python is general purpose, so if you’re also going to do a lot of non-technical computing, it is a great choice. MATLAB is a set of tools and a programing language specifically designed for scientific computing, and is developed through extensive research by many professional developers. This is going to show. It’s not a general purpose language for hobbyists or those working in fields that don’t require mathematical modeling or simulation or analysis. It costs a lot, but you get what you pay for.If Python were a sufficient alternative for all of MATLAB’s functionality, the thousands of companies looking to cut costs and save every penny they could would have replaced MATLAB with Python years ago. Likewise, all academic research institutions, which are even more conservative with their spending, would have cut out MATLAB a long time ago. This has only happened in companies that aren’t doing scientific development and therefore have no need for MATLAB, it hasn’t happened in companies whose bread and butter is scientific expertise, or in academic research institutions that require the best tools. There are a lot of reasons thousands of institutions around the world are still paying a hefty sum for MATLAB. Python is free, and for that price you’re really getting a lot. But the more you use it in comparison to MATLAB for scientific computing, the more you will realize the truth of “You get what you pay for.”",32 followers,Kumar Gaurav,832,302,856.2K,2020,https://www.quora.com/Can-a-computer-be-built-as-big-as-a-planet

Aliens are specialized creatures who are used to their special environment. They depend upon their high-tech tools to survive. Humans, by comparison, have more imagination, ingenuity and can get by with fewer tools (although this is changing.)Also there is the notion that fatal flaws are present from the beginning. In the movie Forbidden Planet the advanced aliens were wiped out by their own machines which fed upon an ignored part of their brains.In Independence Day the aliens are psychic. They can read each other’s minds. Theirs is probably a society devoid of crime or secrets. Thus they built their computer systems with no regard to security or hacking, why would they need to?
