We have portable computers with most field-companies, drones overhead, the latest jets in the air and our satellites in the sky.Our tanks are technological wonders. The technology for tanks to fire, at a pin-point target while on the move-at 50 Km/h is made and used in Israel.We have robot boats, tunnel -destroying technology and face-recognition cameras in most ‘hot-spots’.The technology to shoot down enemy rockets-while in the air-over the enemy side of the fence is made in Israel and well applied.Our computerized and radarized anti-‘car-crash’ system is now sold all around the world.In medicine, We have the latest technologies and we have developed many of them.The simple facts that Google, and many other high-tech companies have R&D centers in Israel —and that the second ‘Silicon Valley’ concept is found in Israel-is a reflection of ‘advanced-technologically’ Israel.…and the local joke: “ Why don’t they move theIsraelThe acute distance between the scientific/technological Israel and all her Arab neighbors…is astounding.

1,"Thanks for the A2A.In some areas, like military drones, irrigation, biotechnology and computer software / hardware, Israel rubs shoulders with the top dogs, worldwide.In terms of technological startups, Israel is the word leader (per capita) and 2nd place (sheer numbers), after the US (which has a population ~50 times larger). This same trend is mirrored in NASDAQ.For more information, read the book: Start-Up Nation: The Story of Israel's Economic Miracle","5,990 followers",Jens Böttiger,566,2.6K,17.6M,2018,https://www.quora.com/How-advanced-is-Israeli-technology
2,"We are a small country without a lot of natural resources or room for agriculture. Our best natural resource is brain power. Not because we are smarter than anyone else, but just because a young person who wants to get ahead in life and have a career will find that the best way to do that is to go to university and study, and in todays’ world technology is the most profitable thing to study.The army too is a force for progress, since technology is necessary for our survival. Iron Dome is a clear example of that.","68,810 followers",Kanthaswamy Balasubramaniam,898,17.3K,413.8M,1995,https://www.quora.com/How-advanced-is-Israeli-technology
3,"Science and technology in Israel is one of the country's most developed sectors. Israel spent 4.2% of its gross domestic product (GDP) on civil research and development in 2013, one of the highest ratios in the world. Israel ranks fifth among the most innovative countries in the Bloomberg Innovation Index. It ranks thirteenth in the world for scientific output as measured by the number of scientific publications per million citizens. In 2014, Israel's share of scientific articles published worldwide (0.9%) was much higher than its share of the global population (0.1%).

In comparison, there are 85 per 10,000 in the United States and 83 per 10,000 in Japan. In 2012, Israel counted 8,337 full-time equivalent researchers per million inhabitants. This compares with 3,984 in the USA, 6,533 in the Republic of Korea and 5,195 in Japan. Israel's high technology industry has benefited from both the country's skilled workforce and the strong presence of foreign high-tech firms and research centres.",10 followers,Paul Rodgers,1K,14.6K,11.5M,2017,https://www.quora.com/How-advanced-is-Israeli-technology

I say this because that’s when I personally asked Sergey about selling the hardware we built for the Google data centers and he replied that he’d rather sell access to our data centers than the machines themselves.Therefore, Sergey had the idea for something like GCloud or AWS that early but they never executed on it.AWS was first to do cloud computing iKubernetes solves a major business problem for Google… they fucked up their cloud strategy and now they have to fix it.DISCLAIMER: I have not worked for Google since April 2013.Google could have jumped into the Cloud business as early at 2008. I say this because that’s when I personally asked Sergey about selling the hardware we built for the Google data centers and he replied that he’d rather sell access to our data centers than the machines themselves.Therefore, Sergey had the idea for something like GCloud or AWS that early but they never executed on it.AWS was first to do cloud computing in a very big way, and that gave them an advantage. Everyone was writing code that locked them into the AWS way of doing things. This “lock-in” effect is very powerful.So how does one break the “lock-in” effect that is helping AWS retain their market share? Find a way to make it easy for applications to be portable.Containers make applications portable between clouds. Therefore, anything Google can do to help people migrate to containers hurts AWS and helps Google, Azure, and all other companies that are late to the game.Kubernetes lowers the barrier to entry, and results in applications/services that are portable between on-prem installations, GCloud, Azure, and anyone else offering k8s-as-a-service. While this may hurt Google a little (because it makes it easy to leave Google Cloud) it helps them by much more (because it makes it easier to move to Google Cloud).This also helps Azure, who was also late to the game. You’ll notice that Microsoft has been putting a huge amount of effort into Kubernetes for the same reasons.",UNKNOWN,Thomas A.

10,"There are probably many, more than I can think of, but what immediately three come to mind.The first is design of robot arms that are compliant or safe around people. Up to until recently, industrial robot arms had safety cages around them and for good reason, because they were not designed to sense or offer safety around human workers and there are cases where injury (and even death) resulted from improper observance of safety procedures. Remember these types of bots typically wield incredible force based about the tasks they are designed for (like moving heavy loads).

Up to until recently, industrial robot arms had safety cages around them and for good reason, because they were not designed to sense or offer safety around human workers and there are cases where injury (and even death) resulted from improper observance of safety procedures. Remember these types of bots typically wield incredible force based about the tasks they are designed for (like moving heavy loads). However, a new generation has now come to market, such as Rethink Robotics' ""Baxter"" whose arms are designed to stop if they contact a person.The second innovation that is relevantly recent is the ability for robots to ""walk"". Just watching Boston Dynamics Big Dog or its quadruped cousins be able to move over irregular terrain or even ice, or Honda's Asimo run or go up and down stairs is impressive. And if you watch the videos of the recent DARPA robotics challenge, you can see others doing this as well. But it still requires some refinement as they sometimes fall over.The final example is the ability to autonomously drive. Google's work on their self-driving car navigation is quite impressive and things are accelerating there faster than I would have guessed.But as I said, there are many, many other areas. Robotics is an industry where things are accelerating. That's good because it takes a lot of technology to get things to a useful level.",63 followers,Lindsay Elizabeth,35.3K,174,32M,2015,https://www.quora.com/How-advanced-is-Israeli-technology
11,"More recently software that enables a robot to be accurately modelled in virtual reality has enabled new manufacturing solutions using robot technology to be developed in parallel with the product under development, reducing the time taken to get new production capacity operational, and hence new products to market. This has gone some way to addressing the concern that robots can be unwieldy in addition to being expensive, and enables Design for Manufacture techniques to be employed where automated processing is to be adopted.",269 followers,Karthik Reddy L,16K,0,0,2017,https://www.quora.com/How-advanced-is-Israeli-technology
