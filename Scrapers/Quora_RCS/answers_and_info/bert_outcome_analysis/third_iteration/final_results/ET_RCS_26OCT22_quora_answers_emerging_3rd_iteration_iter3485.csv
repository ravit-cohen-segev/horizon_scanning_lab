0,"Ah, but Canada did have a space program, with sub orbital rockets, from 1957–1989. That included the Churchill Research Range in northern Manitoba. The range was facilitated and operated jointly by Canada and the USA. They were studying solar activity, the Aurora Borealis and the upper atmosphere. One of the rockets, the Black Brant, was Canadian made and first launched in 1959. About 3,500 of those rockets were launched.In 1962, Canada launched the Alouette 1 satellite, followed by Alouette 2 in 1965.In 1964 Canada was a founding member of Intelsat and launched a communication satellite, callAh, but Canada did have a space program, with sub orbital rockets, from 1957–1989.

2,"First of all, it would have been smaller, probably less than half the original size. That is because the cargo bay of the Space Shuttles were designed to hold the KH-12 spy satellites. This was mandated by the US Air Force who wanted the ability to launch and recover the KH’s using the Space Shuttle. In the end, they opted to launch them using Titan IV launch vehicles and so there would be no need for a massive cargo bay. They could get by with a bay 1/4 the size.Second, the main engines would have been placed on the fuel tank, similar to what the Russians did with their Buran space shuttle.

Not only is this a lighter system than a fly by wire system, it is also more reliable and thus safer.The flight deck would have been a single level, instead of two, and the crew size would have been 2 or 3 astronauts.What would it look like?

Either way, we should hope that others haven’t- even if they were even 1000 years more advanced than us, with 1% higher genetic encoding for IQ, they could have already devised fairly sinister means of counteracting potential threats.More over, we seem quite capable of destroying out own environment and ourselves - as such, we define the greater threat to humanity.But I digress; to answer you original question:No. I doubt it.","6,091 followers",David Tussey,3.1K,1.8K,37.5M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Why-did-Canada-not-develop-their-own-rocket-and-space-programme-in-the-1960s-despite-their-advanced-technology-in-aerospace

The point where literally everything is offensive or has a “deeper meaning than you think”?Generation Z have done so many things. They’ve educated others about important situations that need to be spoken about, they’ve showed solidarity with those in pain, but sometimes the generation, especially the ones from America, revolve everything around anything that is problematic, which isn’t fixing initial problems, but rather being insensitive to actual issues and spreading misinformation.So, yeah, sometimes we need to chill and think before we do/say things.EditLike… erm… this.© Copyrights Reserved.

(why we have tow trucks instead of tow…idk tow witches or whatever). so long as youre in a body on earth magic will never supplant your cell phone, computer, internal combustion engine, modern medicine etc etc.science will inevitably IMO meet up with & merge with magic - which is to say develop a means by which to quantify & observe the energies that underlie sentient life/consciousness and all of existence.idk if it will develop means of manipulating said energy at the push of a button.but the reason for magic in addition to science is bc existence is fundamentally spiritual in nature. i.e. you are not a human capable of spiritual experiences - you are a spirit that is currently having a human experience. when you die you will return to a spiritual existence. you were there before you were here, and youll go back there again. when you do, youll remember that youve done this earth trip several times before, perhaps *many* times.science is wonderful down here but its sorely lacking beyond the material realm.you dont have to believe me, if i hadmt been shown the things i had then i wouldnt believe most of em. youll find out for yourself when you die anyway, and youll learn (remember) that everything is more or less how it should be or is at least working itself toward that point lol.also the quote ab sufficiently advanced tech being indistinguishable from magic is out of context. its authur c. clarke quote from his 3 laws (which had nothing to do with magic). its regarding super advanced civilizations (like aliens with FTL for example) encountering low tech primitives. it is true in the sense that an interstellar civ would have little trouble convincing say neolithic man that they were gods. but its remarking ab the perception of tech when there is a massive disparity in development.",326 followers,Anubhav Jain,2.4K,4.4K,123.7M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Why-did-Canada-not-develop-their-own-rocket-and-space-programme-in-the-1960s-despite-their-advanced-technology-in-aerospace
