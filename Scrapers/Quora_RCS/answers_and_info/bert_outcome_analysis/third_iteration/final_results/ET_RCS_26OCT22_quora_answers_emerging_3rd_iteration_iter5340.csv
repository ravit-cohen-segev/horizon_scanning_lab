11,"I will give two answers: the first on more solid historical ground, and the second more speculative.First answer: Civilization had to wait for the end of the ice age, which terminated about 15,000 years ago. At that time the glaciers had piled up a lot of good topsoil at its edge, and the melting ice provided plenty of water. Agriculture was developed for the first time in human existence, at first in Turkey. Agriculture is key; it means that not everyone has to hunt and gather, but food can be farmed by specialists.

Agriculture was developed for the first time in human existence, at first in Turkey. Agriculture is key; it means that not everyone has to hunt and gather, but food can be farmed by specialists. That allows others to becomes tradesmen, businessmen, and physics professors.Do not underestimate the rapidity of technical innovation during this period. It may seem slow, but that’s because today we take bronze and iron for granted. There were likely enormous advances in farming technology, but the wooden tools and plows used did not last for archeologists to study.The question says that “advanced technology” took place 500 years ago. With the rapid growth of technology, it mightSecond answer (much more speculative, perhaps even whimsical): The true advance of humans came from a human genetic mutation that took place about 3000 years ago. One of my names for it is “the dissatisfaction gene.” This was a gene that made people unsatisfied with their present situation. Animals never developed this; they search for environments that are good enough, and then they are satisfied. House cats are prototypical. But even elephants seem to be happy when they find a place with lots of grass and water.Not humans. Those who had this gene were never happy enough with what they had, and they pushed and developed and worked hard and created an ever expanding civilization.If you too are cursed with this gene (I think I am) then it is difficult to be happy, because no matter what you achieve, you want to do more. For that reason I sometimes refer to it as the “Original Sin Gene.” Like the original sin of Judaism and Christianity, it dooms humans to suffering. No matter how much life improves, we want it to be better.There is a solution that I personally try. I recognize that I must continue to strive to achieve more, and this is my burden. But I also can rise above it, and look at the world, and realize how blessed I am to live in such a wonderful place.

The musky odour of future promise is so very tempting, isn’t it? The electrochemist or battery specialist in the corner going “erm…….excuse me, but……” well, we can ignore him or her, because they’re just going to tell us boring facts and we want to hear about a battery that can take us to the Moon and back and charge up again whilst we’re having a piss, don’t we?Right. Hands up if you know when the first real proto-battery was. Thought so. It was 1794. Keep your hands up if you know when Cruickshank sold the first commercial battery. Mm-hmm. It was 1802. Still keep your hands up if you know when a Planté battery reared its head. Ooh, not many left, is there? 1859. Leclanché battery first appeared? That thinned ’em out, didn’t it? 1866.Were you to stop listening to elongated sermons from certain purveyors of panem et circenses and actually look at what electrochemists (aka heretics) and battery specialists (spawn of Beelzebub) actually do you’d notice a commonality in the above in that they all need an anode and a cathode to shift charges about. This is because there is actually only one way to make a battery and it’s by using some metals and some electrolytes to cause a chemical reaction which allows charges to shift round a closed path (if you’re quantumly inclined) or electrons to zoom about (old school). Yes, we’ve got better materials than had Cruickshank, but we still build ’em much the same way because that’s the only way it can be done and no dollop of fairy dust is going to change that.Right some more. Let’s talk about specific energy and specific power. The former is the reserve in the battery. The latter how much juice it will chuck at your devices in one go without knackering itself. You can have high specific energy. You can have high specific power. But you can’t have both at one go. You compromise with the metalwork to go more one way or the other.Do you know how long a Formula 1 race lasts? It’s however long it takes to complete 305 km and they run round in laps. Except Monaco. That’s only 260 and a bit. Why? because that’s how far a very fast car could go in two hours and two hours is about the time before a driver of said fast car becomes a bit tired and rams it into the crowd like an absent-minded kamikaze pilot. How long does a Formula e race last? Forty-five minutes. Why? Because they use batteries of high specific power but not so much for energy. They won’t keep going much longer.We’ve got the teeny Hyundai thing outside. To get the same performance out of a battery as the tankful of bangy hydrocarbons a battery on it would have to weigh six times as much as the buggy. I don’t think the axles will take it, to be honest.We’ve been here before. Before 1910, electric cars were the preferred choice. Henry Ford’s wife had one. After 1920, they were nearly all gone.Every time you see the words battery, breakthrough and technology in the same sentence always approach the subsequent text with the question “oh what fresh bollocks is this?” because almost inevitably it will be bollocks if you know what it is you are looking at. The only breakthrough in batteries between 1859 and 1990 was using lithium. And that was cramming in more density rather than an actual change in the technology.But most won’t listen because despite worshiping at the altar of “the science” they’ll only listen to the Billy Grahams and not the real theologians who are actually telling it like it is.I blame the EU.
