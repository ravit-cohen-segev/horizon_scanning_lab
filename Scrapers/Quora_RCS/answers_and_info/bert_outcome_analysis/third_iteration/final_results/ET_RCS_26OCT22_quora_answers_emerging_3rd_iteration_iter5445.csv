Using GraphQL, I’m able to back markup with the precise data that’s needed in a single fetch. And if it’s a particularly squirrelly GET with several levels of data required, I don’t have to fret about the RESTful-ness of the URL, or do a lot of custom pre-composition of the response data coming from the API.REST is one of those things that’s beautiful in theory, but often proves frustrating in practice.

I don’t see this changing. C/C++ will remain important and the OS, device drivers and video games I use will use C/C++, but boring business application development will greatly out number such work. JavaC++ is important, but most developers don’t use it, I don’t think its usage pattern will change much over the next ten years (OSes, games and the like will still be written in C++, few boring business apps will be).I did not think “the following important, but not common languages will also remain at the same level as they are now” was interesting, so had it as an aside in a bullet point, not even mentioning C++ by name.Why will Go die?I don’t trust Google to manage a language and it has not yet hit critical mass.In the two years since I wrote this Go has definitely moved from funky new language to niche language, carving out a healthy slice of the DevOps pie. I no longer consider Go at risk of dying in the next eight years.What is wrong with agile?Honestly, I’m not sure. But slamming Scrum in a QCon talk is going to get you a really good reaction from the crowd.

What’s scary is how fast this technology is advancing and the ethical dilemma attached to it. There have been several instances, where the gens of human embryos were edited for research.Earlier in 2013, a molecular technique was introduced that enables any part of the human genome to be altered with extreme precision using CRISPR.CRISPR stands for clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats. CRISPR-Cas9 could be used to modify targeted DNA sequences. The name stems from DNA sequences that consist of palindromic (able to be read the same both forward and backward) repetitions with regular stretches of spacer DNA (a type of DNA that doesn't hold instructions for how to build proteins) between them. Cas9 is a specific type of CRISPR-associated system (Cas) protein.Genome editing has been used for detecting heart disease, blocking HIV cells to replicate, cancer diagnosis, predicting height, IQ, and many more applications.I believe this is one of the emerging technologies to make major strides, considering the huge impact it can have on the human species.",UNKNOWN,Ben Y.
