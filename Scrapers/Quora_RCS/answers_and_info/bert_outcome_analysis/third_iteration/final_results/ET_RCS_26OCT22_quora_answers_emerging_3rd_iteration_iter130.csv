0,"Its going to take far more than just technology to change the world - since its up to people how they choose to use it! A great sociologist Alvin Toffler wrote a fantastic book in the 70's on that idea - that people need to be in control of the technology - not have it control us! And therein is a huge problem - twisted powertripping psychopathic people want to weaponize information to control them, create division and chaos and benefit themselves financially! Its the biggest element of how screwed up our world has become - forget political opinions - I'm talking crime crime and more crime - fIts going to take far more than just technology to change the world - since its up to people how they choose to use it!

3,"It may look like Sony stopped making phones because their availability decreased in some countries like USA, some Asian countries like China or India etc. In USA, for example, Sony sell less phones not because they are bad but because Sony did not agree with American carriers to make adjustments they asked for. Sony did not compromise its priorities. For instance Sony was not welcome on US market anymore after it got itself into a conflict regarding finger scanners - Sony refused to embedd a technology that allows carriers store biometrics in their data base.

Sony did not compromise its priorities. For instance Sony was not welcome on US market anymore after it got itself into a conflict regarding finger scanners - Sony refused to embedd a technology that allows carriers store biometrics in their data base. As we know all fingerprints are collected and kept by USA organizations. Sony refused to share that data and got basically banned from US market, and those that are still available not allowed to have finger scanner in a phones. Sony still does not agree to make such changes!At the same time Sony cell phone branch is not dead and actually far from it. Sony phones are still quite popular in Europe, Australia and Russia and sold thru all major mobile network carriers in there. But where Sony phones really rock is Japan - shops are full of Sony products including phones and it looks like they still have decent sales in native country.Sony phones may not be top notch anymore as they used to be in Ericsson era but they are not bad or lagging (as some comments below stated). Latest products like Sony 1 or upcoming Sony 1 Mark II are on par with all leading brands and using latest processors and expensive premium components and materials. Sony 1 was the first phone to introduce 21:9 cinematic 4K OLED screen in the world. It is covered by Gorilla glass 6 from both sides and has metal frame.Where Sony failing in sales is refusal to bring affordable models to wide masses of people. Instead they are focusing on premium extra pricy models. Sony is a big brand and compensate smaller phone sales by other successful products. However even phone domain is still profitable (even not heaving) for Sony: they sold 9 million phones in 2019. This may look ridiculous comparing to Samsung but if you calculate it is still okay: premium model costs around 1000 dollars, Sony makes profit of 200 - 300 dollars from each. This means over 2 billion dollars yearly. Some less known brands never been in that revenue range ever and still exists.Sony phone situation and stubbornness may be strange and misunderstood but not dead. Yet.I held in hands the previous model of this phone in hands in one of the mobile carrier salons of my country (Europe) ant felt super expensive and premium, very competing. The speakers were loud and camera amazing! But…I didnt get it because it was 1250 euro (1400 dollars).Being big fan of all Sony products and used to enjoy their phones before 2016, now I am happy with my Samsung Note 10+. Because of the stylus and HUGE screen. But this is topic for different time.",256 followers,Priyal Gupta,9.7K,0,0,2020,https://www.quora.com/How-would-you-explain-in-your-own-words-your-idea-about-the-top-technology-in-2021
4,"Greed. Their business practices, I think, are hurting them and the only thing saving them right now is exclusive games. They tried to stone wall cross play, even saying if people want to play with people on PlayStation they should buy a PlayStation. They have been hacked twice.

Microsoft has had it shared of blunder moments but nothing that bad. They have pushed Sony to do cross play, they gave us game pass, and Windows 10 allows you to talk to people on XBox live. So Microsoft is trying to integrate their systems and to me that’s a positive.",719 followers,Sandip Bhatnagar,629,321,1.4M,2020,https://www.quora.com/How-would-you-explain-in-your-own-words-your-idea-about-the-top-technology-in-2021

7,"Technically… technology is in everything we do, it can be in various topics. Health, Science, Reproduction, Robotics, or Engineering. The list goes on. There is no clear way to define topics in technology.
