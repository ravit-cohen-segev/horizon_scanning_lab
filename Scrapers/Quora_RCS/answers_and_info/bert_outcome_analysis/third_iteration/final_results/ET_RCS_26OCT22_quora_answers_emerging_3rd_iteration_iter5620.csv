0,"The quickest way to warm up Mars using current technology would be to releast massive amount of powerful greenhouse gases such as Carbon Dioxide, Methane and Chlorofluorocarbon into Martian atmosphere also melting its polar ice cap. This process may take decades.",33 followers,Matthew Lee,1.2K,548,11.5M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-quickest-way-to-warm-up-Mars-using-current-technology-or-newly-emerging-technologies-and-how-long-would-it-take-to-do
1,"What is the quickest way to warm up Mars using current technology or newly emerging technologies, and how long would it take to do?Well, Mars is a big place. The problem, other than size, is that it has negligible atmosphere. Even for Earth, if we did not have our atmosphere, our average temperature would be well below zero.Why, exactly, does the OP think Mars needs warming up globally? Why does it have to be done ‘quickest’? Quick is not always the best solution long term, nor the most effective.An atmosphere would be useful to keep the place warm, to conserve the sun energy it receives AND tWhat is the quickest way to warm up Mars using current technology or newly emerging technologies, and how long would it take to do?Well, Mars is a big place.

Why does it have to be done ‘quickest’? Quick is not always the best solution long term, nor the most effective.An atmosphere would be useful to keep the place warm, to conserve the sun energy it receives AND to stop a lot of the solar particle radiation and cosmic rays. But, Mars has only half the gravity of Earth, so gas escapes more easily. Also, it has no magnetosphere, so the solar wind strips the atmosphere off over time. For 10,000 years, it is probably not much of a problem. Long term, yes.Several have suggested nuclear explosions. I’m not convinced. It would increase the amount of radiation exposure everybody gets. It would add a permanent long-term layer of radioactivity over the whole surface. It would create no-go areas for a few hundred years.Probably a better solution is to have big tents in useful places with atmosphere which can be warmed without polluting the whole place.An put on an extra woolly jumper.","5,361 followers",Valerio Cietto,677,2.4K,9.1M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-quickest-way-to-warm-up-Mars-using-current-technology-or-newly-emerging-technologies-and-how-long-would-it-take-to-do
2,"Farming is a technology in itself, it’s just that instead of operating mechanical machinery, it’s about operating biological machinery.It’s like engineering, knowledge has to be applied to the real world, it has a practical goal, and claims can be checked through repeated experiments.The use of control groups is not prevalent enough, it would probably be good for farmers to try and implement these.Shared seed banks, open libraries, education, cooperation and sharing of knowledge is a big part of what is missing, to actually pool together the technology, and put it to use.Farming is a more downFarming is a technology in itself, it’s just that instead of operating mechanical machinery, it’s about operating biological machinery.It’s like engineering, knowledge has to be applied to the real world, it has a practical goal, and claims can be checked through repeated experiments.The use of control groups is not prevalent enough, it would probably be good for farmers to try and implement these.Shared seed banks, open libraries, education, cooperation and sharing of knowledge is a big part of what is missing, to actually pool together the technology, and put it to use.Farming is a more down to earth activity: Instead of wondering about whether or not the earth is flat and controlled by lizard people, it makes you wonder about how to keep a certain plant alive, and get more of it.You can do tests yourself, and you can do peer review as a fellow gardener, trying out a certain method or implement or variety of plant.If you look up information on grafting, far from it being something completely theoretical that you can’t really ever know, you will come across techniques that you can actually try, where you can do your own bit of research, and actually check if they work well or notFarming should be more of a collective activity and science, with people trying out different variations, and with different varieties shared and traded instead of just the final product being sold.It’s possible to propagate a lot of plants quite easily, quite quickly, through cuttings.Then little by little, there can be a very big change.Cooking, the art of processing food, is also a form of technology that can be shared, recipes tried and tested, and where you can learn things that you can actually try.",30 followers,Vijaya Lakshmi,691,1.2K,43.4M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-quickest-way-to-warm-up-Mars-using-current-technology-or-newly-emerging-technologies-and-how-long-would-it-take-to-do
