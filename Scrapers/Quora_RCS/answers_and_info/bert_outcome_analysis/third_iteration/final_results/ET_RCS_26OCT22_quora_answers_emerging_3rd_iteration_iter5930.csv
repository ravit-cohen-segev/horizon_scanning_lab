Also, on the other side, new technologies in solar bring a promise of better generation, more flexibility and innovation coupled with seamless adaptability across various topographies and landscapes.Let us discuss some major solar technologies which have been introduced or are already in the pipeline.FloatinWith the BJP government under the helm of its dynamic leadership of Shri Narendra Modi announcing 100GW of Solar deployment in India by 2022 at the Paris Climate Agreement, the solar industry has received a major shot in the arm.Solar prices have witnessed a major reduction over the years. Also, on the other side, new technologies in solar bring a promise of better generation, more flexibility and innovation coupled with seamless adaptability across various topographies and landscapes.Let us discuss some major solar technologies which have been introduced or are already in the pipeline.Floating solar:Floating solar power plants, or floatovoltaics are solar power plants which are installed on water bodies like reservoirs, dams or lakes. Such installations are more economical by way of capital cost saving as the need for costly land and real estate is substituted when the plant is installed on water.Ground and roof-top installations require more fabrication for mounting the panels compared to installation of a floating plant. This results in savings in cost, manpower and resources.Solar panels lose generation efficiency in high temperatures. Floatovoltaics, due to their proximity to water, have cooler surroundings, hence giving better generation and faster payback time.As a floatovoltaics plant covers the water surface, blocking sunlight, it stops the photosynthesis process, stopping the growth of algae resulting in the water staying clean. This coverage also helps in reducing the evaporation of water which helps in saving this valuable resource.BIPV & BAPV:Building Integrated Photovoltaics serve in a dual-purpose manner, as an outer layer of the façade of buildings and as a source of electricity generation. As they can be integrated during the initial construction of a building, they save on construction costs by replacing certain standard materials. Besides helping in generating electricity, BIPVs do not disturb the aesthetics of a building but merge seamlessly into the design elements.Building-Added Photovoltaics are added during a retrofit. Both BIPV and BAPV do not require the racks and mounting equipment of traditional solar PV systems, ultimately saving on costs.Solar Skin:A very dynamic innovative design by MIT engineers, Solar Skin uses selective light filtering to simultaneously display a vibrant image and transmit sunlight to the underlying solar panel with minimal loss of efficiency. Due to this revolutionary feature, it can blend across variety of surfaces and preserve the aesthetics of the surroundings along with efficient functioning.Solar Fabric:Imagine every fabric of the clothing you wear being able to harness the power of the sun. Such fabric has the potential to keep your winter jacket warm, power your phone while in the pocket, even light up lamps from the awnings and generate electricity from window curtains eliminating the cost of setting up solar structures and mountings. Once this technology is developed and feasible the possibilities of its applications are endless.Solar Powered Roads:Solar powered roads are a reality now. They are being designed and built not only for their ability to generate clean energy but they would also power LED street lights during the night and in cold countries they can be designed to have thermal heating capacity to melt snow.Beginning from ground mounted and roof mounted systems, today solar has come a long way. Solar is now more efficient, more flexible and more customization with better applicability across various surfaces. Solar is here to stay and the future is nothing but bright.",0 followers,Lucas Martin,6.4K,65,4.2M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-some-emerging-technologies-with-promising-microcaps

3,"""best"" for what? It really depends on the target product or service, and on the employee's job. The generic answer for a hi-tech startup might be ""top notch development environment"" and ""collaboration tools"". But the details are group decisions.Depending again on the business, if the person doesn't already have a bunch of gadgets they bought just to play with, why are you hiring them?Finally, bear in mind that if someone says ""I need an X"" and the reason makes sense, always buy it.

It would be interesting to find out what the reality is with most of these startups like if the trend is ""more is less"" and everyone starts out with a netbook and google docs or if it is like ""pimp my office"" and employees get an amount to work with.

I think your reading is very appropriate because it speaks precisely of what you are interested in knowing. This brief summary talks about the rest of your days.1- The auto repair shops will disappear.2- The gasoline / diesel engine contains 20,000 car components. An electric motor has only twenty. Electric cars are sold with a lifetime warranty and are only repaired by dealers. It only takes 10 minutes to remove and replace a new electric motor.3- Defective electric motors will not be repaired at the dealer's workshop, but will be sent to a municipal or regional repair shop where robots and intelligent systems will repair them.4- When a light comes on that indicates a malfunction of the electric motor, you can drive it to a place where besides a car wash station there will be a place where, while you have a good coffee, your car will be equipped with a new electric motor.5- The service stations will disappear or become electric charging stations, slow or fast, for all types of vehicles.6- All the edges of the sidewalks of the streets and the public and private parking lots will have electric recharging points. The companies will install electric charging stations that, in fact, are already installed in cities where they have already begun their transition to electric mobility, such as Oslo, Amsterdam, Paris, San Francisco, San Jose, San Diego, Shanghai, Beijing, Shenzhen, Montreal, Portland, etc., among others.7- The main manufacturers of road vehicles have already allocated funds to start building new plants where only electric cars are manufactured.8- The coal industries will disappear. The oil companies will leave. The oil drilling will stop. So say goodbye to OPEC. The Middle East will get into trouble.9- There are already ZEB technologies,10- A baby born within a decade will not see gasoline cars more than in museums.The FUTURE is moving faster than most of us can handle.11- In 1998, Kodak employed 170,000 people and sold 85% of all the photographic papers in the world. In just a few years, their business model disappeared and they went bankrupt. Who would have thought that this would happen one day?12- What happened with Kodak and Polaroid will happen with many companies in the next 5 to 10 years ... and most people do not see it coming. Volkswagen will no longer have any other opportunity to cheat.13- Did you think in 1998, that three years later, you would never take photos in a movie camera? Did you buy a digital camera? Nowadays, with smartphones, who has a digital camera to take pictures, if we have smart phones?14- Even when digital cameras were invented in 1975. The first digital camera only had 10,000 pixels, but they followed Moore's law. Then, as with all exponential technologies, it was a disappointment for a while, before taking off and becoming the only camera reference in the market, and it did so in just a few years.15- Now this pace of innovations or more will happen again - but this time everything will happen much faster - thanks to Artificial Intelligence applied to commercial sales, to artificial intelligence applications in professional activities such as intelligent health systems systems, to autonomous and electric automobiles, to education assisted by Artificial Intelligence, to 3D printing, to intelligent agriculture and to jobs based on Shared Intelligence, SI, which will modify the generic competences of workers.16- Do not forget to read the books17- The intelligent software has penetrated and will continue to penetrate most of the traditional sectors, during the next 3 to 10 years.18- The UBER platform is just a software tool, they do not have cars and now it is the largest taxi company in the world.19- Airbnb is now the largest digital hotel platform in the world, although they do not own an apartment.20-21- In the United States, young lawyers can no longer find work. With22- The23- Facebook now has a form recognition software that is able to recognize faces better than humans. By 2030, computers will be smarter in the vast majority of jobs than humans. Only human-machine collaborative work based on SI (Shared Intelligence) will have a future.24- Autonomous cars: in 2018, the first autonomous electric vehicles began to circulate in some parts of the United States. In the coming years, we will see how the entire automotive industry will begin to be affected. In about five years or sooner, you will not have to own a car, in addition to shared electric vehicles, you can also call a car with your phone, it will appear at your location and take you to your destination.25- You do not need to park the autonomous electric car, you will pay only the distance traveled and you can work or rest while driving. Many of today's youngest children will never have a driver's license and will not own a car either. The public transport, the shared electric car and the autonomous taxi will make it possible.26- This deployment will change our cities because we will need from 90% to 95% fewer cars on the streets before the end of the century. Thus, cities will be able to convert old parking spaces into pedestrian zones and green parks.27- Around 1.2 million people die each year, worldwide as a result of traffic accidents, even distracted or intoxicated. Now we have an accident every 62,137 miles; Thanks to autonomous driving, the accident rate will be reduced, becoming: an accident every ten million km. This ratio will save an extra million lives every year in the world.28- Most traditional vehicle manufacturers will surely go bankrupt. They will try to give you an evolutionary approach or they will simply build a better car, while the technology companies (Tesla, Apple, Google) will give you the revolutionary approach and build autonomous cars as if they were computers with wheels.29- Observing what the vast majority of the world's car manufacturers are doing now. As of this years, Volvo will not manufacture more cars with internal combustion engines. All 2019 models, all will be exclusively electric or hybrid, with the aim of eliminating hybrid models.30- Many Volkswagen and Audi engineers are completely terrified by Tesla and should be. There is more to observe all the companies that already offer electric vehicles. Something that was unheard of just a few years ago.31- The insurance companies will have big problems because, since without accidents, the costs will become much cheaper. The model of your car insurance will disappear.32- Real estate will change. Because if you can work while traveling, people will leave their towers to settle in more beautiful and affordable neighborhoods in the periphery.33- Cities will be less noisy and will not pollute the environment because all new cars will run on electricity.34- The cities will also look much healthier.35- The electricity will be incredibly cheap and clean.36- Solar energy and wind energy have known an exponential growth curve during the last 30 years, but now we can see the impact will be increasing. Fossil energies will be banned.37- Fossil energy companies are desperately trying to limit access to the network to avoid competition from domestic solar installations, but this abuse that undermines freedom of trade, simply can not continue because non-fossil technologies are much more competitive38- Health: The price of Tricorder X will go down a lot. Currently, there are companies that manufacture a medical device (called Star Trek Tricorder) that will work with your phone, which will take your retinal scanner, your blood sample and the rhythm of your breathing. Currently there are more than 70 biomarkers capable of identifying almost all diseases. There are also dozens of telephone applications available now for health reasons.39-Today, in the case of a gasoline vehicle, the sum of the weight of a 15-gallon gasoline tank (110.2 lbs, 45 kWh efficient) and the weight of the induction motor is 837.8 lbs. The total weight represents a total weight of 948 lbs. On the other hand, in the case of the electric vehicle, the weight of the batteries of a 60 kWh electric car is 882 lbs and if we add the weight of an electric motor of 67 lbs. The total also represents approximately 948 lbs. Which means that vehicles have the same energy density. The same would start to happen with commercial airliners.40. At present, substantial improvements have already been made with respect to the increase in the energy density of batteries for airplanes, which will grow between 5 and 8% per year. This means that we can achieve that this ambitious objective, consisting of the fact that the kerosene planes capable of transporting 150 passengers up to a distance of about 683.5 miles were all electric, would be fulfilled at the beginning of the 2040s decade. The biokerosene could be used in larger aircraft, until the technology allowed to use only electric batteries aided by the electrical generation from solar energy.WELCOME TO TOMORROW: although, in fact, it arrived a few years ago.Let's wake up with the desire to prepare for the future, so that the challenges of the 21st century do not surprise us as usual. Instead of strangling us with narrow thoughts, which prevent us from adapting to changes in a non-traumatic way, it is necessary to eliminate unnecessary obstacles in the spirit. We need to be owners of our future and thus enjoy our world as a better place that will allow all human beings to find the lost paradise.","5,085 followers",Bobby Tatro,3.9K,2.2K,45.6M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-some-emerging-technologies-with-promising-microcaps

Climate change will fundamentally alter this Planet’s thermal regulation systems, shutting down the North Atlantic current and plunging the Planet into another deep freeze!I know, Global “Warming” makes everyone think we’re going to fry the Planet to death, but that’s only the beginning! It can also lead to a new Ice AgeIf our climate changes by as little as 2 degrees, we can pretty much kiss everything we know now, goodbye! Coastlines forever changed by dozens to hundreds of miles, erratic and extremely damaging weather patterns and storms, drought like we’ve never seen in places that you’d never expect and torrential rains in others.Every hurricane could easily become a Mega-Hurricane and last much longer, travelling further. Vast majority of tornadoes will be F5’s, or even worse!Let’s just put it this way…there is NOTHING more important for our long term survival, than trying to limit the effects of our reckless use of hydrocarbons and other pollutants over the last 200 years. We’ve already gone past a point where we could possibly prevent much of the beginning effects on the Planet, we ARE going to warm by 1 degree and possibly a bit more! This alone is going to create long lasting changes to our Planet that will make survival for many species near impossible, but we can start limiting the extent of the damage right now, by acting in a responsible way and supporting changes that will lessen our carbon footprint dramatically!Yes, it will hurt all of us for awhile, changing a Global power needs structure won’t happen overnight and won’t be easy, but the consequences of NOT “biting the bullet” now, may just mean that our Children and Grandchildren may have to struggle to survive in a World they can no longer save!No more burying your heads in the sand deniers…it’s happening NOW, the effects are obvious for all to see and the onus is on ALL of us to work towards a sustainable Planet, no matter the economic consequences.",0 followers,Emeleigh Cormack,6.5K,0,0,2021,https://www.quora.com/If-an-emerging-start-up-gives-new-six-figure-salaried-employees-a-25-000-technology-budget-what-is-the-best-way-to-spend-this-amount-on-a-desktop-computer-laptop-mobile-devices-tablets-HDTV-Monitors-etc

18,"1. Wind PowerHuge strides have been made over the past 20 years to harvest the power of wind. Progress is bred from necessity, of course, as growing global concerns about global warming and ecological damage caused by pollution call for cleaner, sustainable energy.2. Solar EnergyMuch like wind energy, solar energy has seen an increase in efficiency and a decrease in price in recent years, making solar power a $3-billion industry. New legislation and regulations which make it affordable for businesses and homeowners to convert to solar are responsible for solar energy’s growth over the past 5 y1. Wind PowerHuge strides have been made over the past 20 years to harvest the power of wind. Progress is bred from necessity, of course, as growing global concerns about global warming and ecological damage caused by pollution call for cleaner, sustainable energy.2. Solar EnergyMuch like wind energy, solar energy has seen an increase in efficiency and a decrease in price in recent years, making solar power a $3-billion industry. New legislation and regulations which make it affordable for businesses and homeowners to convert to solar are responsible for solar energy’s growth over the past 5 years, and 2016 will be no different.While only a third of the solar energy available in the US is currently harnessed in the west, this area is geographically superior for solar power generation, and improved government incentives in California indicate this will be the fastest-growing market.3. 3D PrintingThe new millennium has brought us some mind-blowing technology, but none has more potential for impacting the entire world quite like 3D printing.If you’re not familiar with the concept, 3D printers are loaded with additives which can be used like ink to create 3-dimensional objects. That’s4. Legal MarijuanaLegal marijuana sales have grown exponentially since 2012, when Colorado legalized the drug and created the world’s first fully regulated market for recreational marijuana use. In addition to selling the raw plant, it is also being sold as concentrates, edibles, and even beauty products in order to expand the market.Marijuana sales are expected to surpass $20 billion between now and 2020, and that’s if the market stays its course. If other states legalize recreational marijuana use in that time, the industry could experience even greater success.5. Video GamesOver the years, video game developers have been expanding their appeal to reach new markets, including adults and females. This effort has been paid back many times, as the video game industry commands healthy growth year after year. Consumer confidence continues to improve, and there is speculative excitement regarding new virtual reality (VR) technology.While VR will certainly have an effect on the gaming industry, it also has potential in other markets. Whether or not other industries will adopt VR for practical purposes, such as training medical professionals, remains to be seen.6. Artificial IntelligenceFor having come so far, artificial intelligence still has a long way to go. With hopes that AI will one day be able to help solve humanity’s most pressing concerns, billions of dollars fund the research of artificial intelligence every year. Major players include IT companies like Google and Apple, who are already leaders in the field, providing us with such AI amenities as voice-recognition software and self-driving cars.Experts expect the global demand for “smart” machines will increase 20% every year until at least 2020.7. Sustainable Construction MaterialsIn the wake of an international recession, many countries, including the United States, are creating an initiative to boost construction jobs. There are plenty of post-industrial sites around the developed world which need to be rebuilt, and much like the call for sustainable energy sources, governments and consumers alike are calling for greener building materials.Green construction is currently a $36-billion industry, and it is expected to grow an additional 10% by 2020.This industry depends heavily on consumer demand, and may have an even greater outlook with increased government regulations and successful marketing.8. Cyber Fraud DetectionWhere there’s an opportunity to make a quick buck, be sure that there are criminals out there concocting a plan. The trend of doing business and keeping sensitive information on computers will increase, and so will the demand for protection against cyber criminals.Businesses and individuals alike will require protection from cyber fraud for the foreseeable future, but in the next 5 years, this industry is expected to grow over 12% annually.9. DronesDrone technology is new, but the potential for application in a variety of other industries including agriculture, the military, and parcel delivery have already caught the attention of investors. This creates an excellent opportunity in the market to expand research and development of drones, making them more viable with each in iteration. With a projected annual growth of almost 17% annually until 2022, very little is likely to stifle the growth of this industry.10. SiliconRelated to the demand for solar panels, silicon has also been a slowly but steadily growing market in the past decades. In addition to solar panels, silicon is also required to make electronics and building materials, which you may notice are also on this list. For this reason, experts expect to see silicon’s demand increase in the coming years as other industries take hold.These 10 industries show tremendous potential in 2016 and beyond, indicating a future of environmental consciousness and an even greater focus on electronics and AI.","5,361 followers",Valerio Cietto,677,2.4K,9.1M,2017,https://www.quora.com/If-an-emerging-start-up-gives-new-six-figure-salaried-employees-a-25-000-technology-budget-what-is-the-best-way-to-spend-this-amount-on-a-desktop-computer-laptop-mobile-devices-tablets-HDTV-Monitors-etc
