They are founded upon the attempt to create a completely new type of universal value.It seems as if there is nothing backing such currencies other than cryptographic algorithms. However, the cryptography is intended to provide reliability and trust, which holds value in and of itself. It is as if the creators of cryptocurrencies are declaring that human nature and all of its “baggage” has no access to this territory.The modern financial system cannot boast such a feature. Instead, its money is produced by banks and is a factor of the political and economic influences of specific countries and organizations. In other words, the “old” money serves very specific interests.However, before our very eyes is emerging a new, extra-governmental, extra-historical currency, claiming to become a universal, absolute equivalent, even to a point of driving gold out of its immovable position.Why did cryptocurrencies ultimately come about?The birth of cryptocurrency comes as a result of a new need for it ripening in today’s increasingly globalized society.Although many people criticize globalization, it is nonetheless a natural phenomenon that reflects humanity’s current state. We have become one technological and economic whole, but we still reject our state of oneness psychologically. That is why we still do not know how to use and integrate cryptocurrencies systematically into the mainstream.Yet it still does not change its essence: that the global world is demanding a global monetary equivalent independent of local, subjective interests.The overblown human ego on a global scale is gradually building respective global systems for itself in a way that makes no artificial ideological attachments. There is no “good” or “evil” here, but only business in its purest form.Also, what difference does it make if the reciprocal trust of the parties is provided by virtual computer computations? On the contrary, it causes improvement due to fewer errors in the calculations.In short, cryptocurrencies are a global trend and, for the most part, it makes no sense to resist them. In the future, we will develop more universal parameters, but of a social nature.The day will come when, by virtue of a new quality of interconnection between us, a new “currency” will emerge—social rating—expressed by a clear equivalent that anyone could understand.People will be able to accumulate it, but it won’t be for buying or selling. It is more likely to have a comparative nature while having completely real value. It is because society, especially a global one, cannot be based on bare egoism alone. Of course, it is rational in its own way, but when left to its own devices, it leads to a dead end.Our social aspect must take the upper hand over self-focus so that the whole will not fall apart into pieces. These are the paradigms of a new time, whose essence is not a single currency, but new relationships between people in a united, modern world.","55,750 followers",Loy Machedo,582,5.7K,66.3M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-are-your-thoughts-on-emerging-technologies-like-cryptocurrency-as-they-relate-to-finance

Furthermore, both private and public sectors are warming up to the idea of adopting cryptocurrencies in their financial dealings such as making payments, value storage, and as an investment.The history of cryptocurrency goes back decades ago when cryptography started making digital advances. This is the technology that has helped develop and evolve the variety of encryption techniques that make cryptocurrency networks secure and reliable to take on different transactions. Now with over 5,000 cryptocurrencies and growing, let’s look at these reasons as to why cryptocurrency is the future of finance.Varied Values Of CryptocurrencyWhile cryptocurrency doesn’t have an intrinsic value, it holds value in the following ways:More And More Actors Are Becoming ReceptiveCryptocurrency is believed to be increasingly becoming a more acceptable financial system. Both private and public sectors have shown great interest in it, and it’s now openly recognized across many sectors. So far, there are public and private actors that have openly recognized cryptocurrency as part of their financial systems. Institutional investors, technology-focused corporations, and even national central banks all over the world have started to incorporate cryptocurrency in their operations.Also, with its acceptability, new policies and regulations are being put in place to create regularized practices for the future. The policies are also being used to put all players in check as more players continue to break into space.Transactional And Banking BenefitsAs cryptocurrency use grows day by day, acceptability and accessibility continue to be put in the spotlight. The cryptographic technique and technology also keep evolving and advancing which leads to the creation of a better and stronger cryptocurrency financial system. Presently, these are the apparent benefits the system offers as a financial system.It allows for anonymity while transacting as the system is powered by the use of different cryptographic techniques. These methods ensure data protection to avoid information falling into the wrong hands. All data transmitted is literally hidden from unauthorized persons.Transactions carried out using cryptocurrency can’t be changed or forged, and it’s transmitted in extremely high-security networks. However, financial records can still be traced for proof.In a world where there’s still a large population without access to formal financial services, cryptocurrency offers a viable and concrete solution.Conventional banking is restrictive due to a lack of personal identification documents, account opening and operating funds, or proximity to an institution. People with no bank accounts worldwide can now tap into this financial model that offers instant access from anywhere, lower transaction costs, and fast processing of transactions.The Dawning Of Decentralized Finance (DeFi)The need for transparent, secure, and accessible financial systems is said to be mounting and becoming more obvious. This is believed to be caused by the current centralized financial system’s continued failure to provide financial freedom and credibility to users. Many see decentralized finance or DeFi as a system that can offer more transparency and better transactional security and replace some conventional financial processes soon.DeFi is said to be quickly gaining traction in investing, trading, borrowing, and lending that catalyze a revolution in today’s financial services. The increase in demand and accessibility of cryptocurrency exchanges are increasingly raising the popularity of different DeFi systems worldwide. Along with it, cryptocurrency exchanges have become well-known with investors too.Therefore, cryptocurrency is believed to continue to push changes to financial systems as they’re known today. As a result, the DeFi created on a public blockchain is becoming a more viable alternative financial system that offers more access to financial services. Anyone anywhere can connect to it while it also offers transparency.",27 followers,Benjamin Price,1.2K,0,0,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-are-your-thoughts-on-emerging-technologies-like-cryptocurrency-as-they-relate-to-finance

3,"I have a working proof of concept prototype of a Centrifugal propeller. A video of it is posted on YouTube. I am within a couple of weeks from having a practical purpose prototype that will actually lift into the air. The Centrifugal Propeller will replace all jet engines, rockets, and most air and marine propellers. It will also be used for lifting purposes both commercially and domestically. It has no speed limit in outer space because it will continually accelerate.",0 followers,Lucas Martin,6.4K,65,4.2M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-are-your-thoughts-on-emerging-technologies-like-cryptocurrency-as-they-relate-to-finance
4,"I think programming is going to become significantlyRight now, most programmers have a pretty ""batch-oriented"" programming process: you write some code, then you run it and see what happens. Or maybe you run some tests. Either way, you have a very distinct edit-run-edit cycle. This is even more pronounced with statically typed languages where typechecking as an action is split from editing code. Again, you write some code and then typecheck it; if you have a type error you fix it and repeat, otherwise you're set.Of course, there are some pretty standard tools that are a bit mI think programming is going to become significantlyRight now, most programmers have a pretty ""batch-oriented"" programming process: you write some code, then you run it and see what happens.

This is even more pronounced with statically typed languages where typechecking as an action is split from editing code. Again, you write some code and then typecheck it; if you have a type error you fix it and repeat, otherwise you're set.Of course, there are some pretty standard tools that are a bit more interactive. A REPL lets you load up some code, run snippets and inspect variables. A debugger lets you go through a computation step by step. An IDE can make error checking inline by highlighting broken code. However, all these are still pretty limited.At first, this is going to be primarily a UI/UX advancement. Bret Victor has a some talks like this, andI've even seen some cool interactive development support in Emacs:However, these tools are still very new. The actual user experience is still being developed, and the backends are still very primitive.Languages will also adapt to be more interactive. Haskell is already going in this direction, especially with ""type holes"". The idea is simple--instead of writing a part of your program, you can leave a ""hole"" there; the compiler can then tell you what type itIn the longer run, we'll see more advanced backend logic taking advantage of interactivity. For example, we could incorporate efficient search to interactively fill in parts of algorithms according to assertions. The programmer would guide the search by specifying some constraints, but the actual code would be produced by an algorithm. Consider various applications ofSo, my prediction: we will see a much more interactive programming environment coupled with sophisticated tools on the backend assisting the programmer","51,716 followers",Chris Ebbert,906,11.4K,278.6M,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-top-5-emerging-technologies-that-could-change-the-internet-over-the-next-decade
