Instead of buying the normal, cheap cover (except that it’s Apple, so cheap is a distinctly relative term) I bought a snooty, super-rich-guy case with built-in Bluetooth keyboard (just ’cause I’m baller like that), and was shocked to find that shift+enter on my Bluetooth keyboard makes a single space. Hooray!So, if you write Quora on your phone or tablet, all you need to do to be able to single-space is to buy a new keyboard.But here’s the (marginally) good news: If you already own a Bluetooth keyboard, you can probably use that. I have never tried to hook a Bluetooth keyboard up to a phone, but I see no reason why it couldn’t be done, and as soon as you have those keys, you can single-space yourself silly.IP.S.

Apparently he was some kind of early Spartan. If I’m getting this wrong, please correct (and teach) meSpartan 1:Spartan 1’s are like one step above normal soldiers. Nowhere near the powerhouses the 2’s are. Their Warhammer 40k equivalent would be an Imperial Guardsmen. Elite soldiers with special training that face the horrors of the galaxy and come out on top.Vs the might of the Space Marines.Let’s quickly go over the stats of the Space Marines:Ok now for the match ups:In 40k lore, a small squad of Guardsmen can kill a chaos space marine with little to no trouble. However this is due to their Lasgun rifles being stupidly powerful (when used properly) & the Guard having entire combat doctrines dedicated to fighting Space Marines.Spartan 1’s are no doubt skilled combatants. However their standard 7.62 rifles are not able to penetrate even the weakest Astartes armor, nor would they have any training or readiness for the combat situation.I believe it would take anywhere from 20–30 Spartan 1’s to take a Space Marine down. Whether it be one of them grabs a heavy weapon like a Rocket Launcher and the marine can’t dodge in time and gets hit. However even then the marine can take about 3 rockets before he drops. Of the 20–30 Spartans, I believe at least 15 of them will be killed in the process. However the marine may very well kill them all.Now for Spartan 2’s.I like to call these guys Mini Space Marines. VERY impressive soldiers.When comparing a Spartan 2 to a Space Marine, think of the Space Marine’s stats but worse. Space Marines are bigger, stronger, smarter, (sometimes) faster, their armor and weapons are FAR superior.I believe it would take 4–5 Spartan 2’s to take down a Space Marine, my reason for this (for that one idiot that’s gonna leave a comment going “NO A SINGLE SPARTAN 2 CAN LITERALLY KILL EVERY SPACE MARINE EVER REEEEEEEEE” )Yeah sure and Master Chief can kill the Emperor.Anyway, Let’s take the fight with Atriox in Halo Wars 2.3 Spartan 2’s got their asses annihilated by this guy. Atriox only letting them go for… plot? I think he was looking for their base or something idkThe point is Atriox toyed with them, taunted them, let them go. A Space Marine wouldn’t do any of those things. First and foremost, Space Marines would shit on Atriox. I made a post about that a while ago if anyone wants to find the question.Secondly, as said, the Marine wouldn’t waste his time with talk, or staring down his foes. The Spartans would not have gotten the chance to gain their bearings or even comprehend what is going on. Placing a Marine in place of Atriox, the fight would’ve lasted seconds at most.So with that in mind, also realize Spartan 2’s have the same issue the 1’s have. Their standard issue rifles would have no effect on the marine’s armor. They’d have to punch, kick, and use anti tank weaponry like the Spartan Laser & Rocket Launcher to kill the marine.Assuming 6 Spartans meet the marine in a fight, I believe they would take him down. However I also believe at least 1/2 of those Spartans would die.As powerful as the 2’s are, they’re no match for the Space Marines.As for the 3’s:They’re downgraded 2’s. Same issues with the weapons, to keep it quick:10 Spartan 3’s meet the marine, I think at least 5 of them would die. Maybe closer to 6–7.Conclusion:Spartans are VERY powerful soldiers. They’re very cool soldiers! But you gotta remember 2 things:1: Halo is a universe about humanity’s last stand. Spartans were made to give humanity a chance against a relentless onslaught(shut up about the real purpose of Spartans I don’t care about the rebellions)2: In Warhammer 40k, humanity IS the relentless onslaught. Space Marines are made to kill Aliens twenty stories high, demons, and god like beings.Of course the Spartan’s aren’t gonna stand a chance. They’re not supposed to! That doesn’t make Spartans weak, it’s just that Space Marines are so over the top and wacky that it’s not even fair comparing the two.",4 followers,Phil Lang,852,4K,7M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Is-there-any-way-to-make-a-new-line-single-spaced-on-the-Quora-mobile-app

Spartans do not get credit for their survivability.Space marines are often trained from birth to fight and have blessed weaponry, and while I am inclined to note the spartan’s weaponry, it would never stack up one on one, but they possess the weapons to break space marine armor. Spartans are also usually best when in teams, even with regular soldiers instead of other Spartans. They fight best that way and they are essentially fearless.The problem with space marines is that they are cocky, thinking of themselves as higher up than regular humans, whereas Spartans don't in the big picture, even if some hold space marine style views.All you need is some good teamwork, good firepower, and the Spartans could do it casualty free.",539 followers,Papa Shadow,866,174,4.8M,2017,https://www.quora.com/Is-there-any-way-to-make-a-new-line-single-spaced-on-the-Quora-mobile-app

The huge, huge advantage that the Space Marine has is that the Spartans are armed with MA5 assault rifles firing modern-day 7.62 ammunition. In other words, it makes the basic lasgun look like an unstoppable rape machine and may as well fire jelly beans by WH40k standards. However, it IS powerful enough to (eventually) bring the Space Marine down with concentrated fire to the joints, which the Spartans are more than capable of pulling off with professionalism and ease in most any given situation. Nonetheless if the Space Marine can draw a solid bead on one of the Spartans with his boltgun, then that Spartan is incapacitated at absolute best and is in fact most likely very, very dead.

The S2s were augmented supersoldiers that could change the tide of battles.Strategy/experience:Armor + Augmented abilities:Weapons:Overall Capabilities:ADEPTUS ASTARTES [Dark Angels chapter] (A tactical marine, NOT A PRIMARIS):The Emperor’s angels of death, the Adeptus Astartes (AKA space marines) are feared and revered across the Imperium, with single Astartes changing the outcome of entire campaigns. The Astartes are transhuman warriors who are genetically crafted to be the perfect weapons of the Imperium’s wrath.Strategies/Experience:Armor & Augmentations:Weapons & Equipment:Overall capabilities:Verdict:The Spartan IIs, while certainly being formidable supersoldiers of their universe, are simply not as powerful as the transhuman warriors that are the Adeptus Astartes.

Where a Spartan 2 would die from loss of limbs, an Astartes wouldFight:Round 1:[Location: hanger of a Venator, with a few ruined starfighters & tanks lying around][There is a missile launcher beneath one of the ruins]Begin:Separated from his squad, the Spartan 2 continues onwards to the rendezvous point, making note of the destruction he sees as he approaches the hanger of this ship. As he enters the hanger, a bolter round slams into his chest, knocking him over and almost disabling his energy shield. Quickly, the Spartan roles behind nearby wreckage before popping back up, scanning his surroundings, and opening fire on the Astartes across the hanger. The extra second he took to find the Astartes was his undoing, however, as another bolter round strikes him in the head barely a second after he popped up.Knocked over again, and with his shields destroyed, the Spartan quickly recovers and hurls a grenade over the wreckage. As the explosion goes off, he dives out from behind his cover and opens fire again, only to be struck by another bolter round, which knocks him backward and destroys a large portion of the MJOLNIR armor on his torso. Quickly, the Spartan activates his bubble shield and looks around, seeing a missile launcher partially obscured under another nearby wreck. As three bolter rounds slam into the bubble shield (which still holds), the Spartan makes a dive for the missile launcher, only for a fourth round to slam into his chest, ending him instantly.The Astartes makes his way over to the fallen soldier and carefully picks up the bubble shield generator, before receiving new orders over the vox and dashing off to regroup with his squadron.Round 2:[Location: Jedi Temple hallway][Spartan Laser behind one pillar, Sniper rifle behind another]Begin:The Spartan jogs into the hallway and almost immediately dives behind one of the columns as a hail of bolder rounds flies past him. Returning fire from behind his cover, the Spartan’s AI notifies him of a Spartan Laser behind another one of the pillars as another round of bolter fire rips large chunks out of his cover. With practiced skill, the Spartan hurls a frag down the hall before making a dash for the pillar with the Spartan Laser. With equal skill, his own grenade is hurled right back at the pillar he was just standing behind, and a bolter round catches his left arm as he takes cover behind the new column, damaging his energy shield. As the Spartan picks up the Spartan Laser and begins to charge it, he hears what sounds like a brief series of clicking noises and the sound of something else being charged.As the Spartan prepares to aim and fire the Laser, a round from the Tactical Marine’s overcharged Plasma pistol obliterates both the column and the Spartan 2 himself, with only the legs of the Spartan remaining standing for a second before falling to the ground, lifeless.Round 3 (melee attempt):[Random sci-fi hallway][No other weapons]Begin:Both opponents appear at opposite ends of the hallway and both open fire immediately as the Space Marine charges forwards and the Spartan ducks back out of the opening. Bullets bounce harmlessly off of the Space Marine as he reaches the end of the hallway in mere seconds, catching the Spartan off guard. Quickly, the Marine punches with his fist, sending the Spartan flying backward and stunning him. In less than a second, the Marine draws his knife and lunges forward as the Spartan tries to regain his bearings. The Spartan manages to barely dodge the first knife blow, but not the Marine’s armored foot, which connects with the Spartan’s head, dealing massive trauma to the Spartan, who is almost killed outright. Quickly and lethally, so as not to waste ammo or dirty his knife, the Astartes stomps down on the Spartan’s now broken helmet and head, ending the fight instantly.Verdict part 2:As demonstrated, the Astartes overwhelmed the Spartan, who couldn’t move fast enough to use his smaller stature to his advantage and couldn’t take enough hits to deal out any lasting damage himself. The win clearly goes to the Adeptus Astartes.Sources:Warhammer 40k wikiHalo WikiGoogle [for the images]",4 followers,Alex Boast,892,559,1.3M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Is-there-any-way-to-make-a-new-line-single-spaced-on-the-Quora-mobile-app

The Covenant slowly but resolutely goomba-stomps the rest of humanity because there's no heroic supersoldiers to save the day. Subsequent generations of Covenant citizens look back on the conquest with patriotic pride and shudder when they think about that one battle with the thirty-ought giant batshit screaming humans who wrecked everyone's day and died unceremoniously.The thing about the Adeptus Astartes is that they're hyper-specialized for frontline combat. Everything about them - their gene seed, their armor, their weapons, their combat doctrine - is designed to dish out and tank as much damage as physically possible. They will stand in the meat grinder and unleash hell until the enemy is dead or they are. More often than not, it's the former.But the Human-Covenant war was more than a series of head-on charges. Sabotage, reconnaissance, assassination, guerilla warfare, infiltration, VIP extraction. These and more were just as common and often more important than frontline engagements. Missions like these required cunning, adaptability, versatility, subtlety. Spartans were all these things. Commandoes who could fill any role and do it better than anyone else. Space Marines, however, are 8-foot tall behemoths with guns the size of ponies who shake the earth with each step and scream dogma at their enemies. They aren't exactly built for subtlety. They would win every frontal assault. But the second you stuck one in one of the delicate black ops missions Spartans thrive at, he would fail miserably and probably get a plasma torpedo dropped on his head for the trouble.And that's just the ground stuff. Cycling out thirty Spartan-II's with thirty Astartes changes f*ck-all about the space engagements, which humanity was still cripplingly weak at. Even replacing all the II's, III's and Orions with Astartes wouldn't have mattered in the long run. Space Marines are devastatingly effective at a handful of things. But Spartans are extremely effective at a wide variety of things. And it's that versatility that made them so potent. It's that versatility that won the day in the long run.UPDATE 11/01/21""In ancient times, men built wonders, laid claim to the stars and sought to better themselves for the good of all. But we are much wiser now.""Oh, the young and foolish. After nearly four more years down the 40k rabbit hole, this answer makes me want to relax in a Jacuzzi filled with burning promethium. Alright, time to fix this.Space marines outstrip Spartans in ability and equipment. They are eight foot tall gene warriors who spit acid and breathe vacuum and don’t care about arbitrary concepts like “gaping hole” and “missing limbs.” They’re clad in what could be described as a man-portable pillbox made of unobtanium that is designed to eat tank rounds and shrug off plasma. Their favorite weapons include an automatic RPG that turns armored opponents to mist and a chainsaw made of knives hard enough and sharp enough to chew through solid diamond. Despite being refrigerator-sized transhumans that weigh as much as two cows stacked on top of one another, space marines can move faster than the eye can process and can outrun an incoming missile. An Astartes would crack open a Spartan like a can of pringles, eat his head, digest his memories and use those memories to obtain the Spartan’s WiFi password.Basically, if a space marine acted the same way as a Spartan, he’d do it a hundred times better.But that’s the caveat: IF a space marine acted the same way as a Spartan. And this brings us to the Codex.The Codex Astartes, the military treatise that mandates how space marines organize and conduct themselves, can generally be regarded as the 40k equivalent to Spartan combat doctrine. It’s basically a mix of Art of War and the Holy Bible. Every space marine chapter has a different approach to adopting the Codex. Some, like the Ultramarines or Hammers of Dorn, hold the Codex as holy writ and adhere to it religiously. Others, like the Crimson Fists or Carcharodons, have a more liberal interpretation of the Codex and bend the rules as necessary. And there are some like the Black Templars and Space Wolves who have a passing respect for the Codex at best but otherwise ignore it entirely and do their own thing.The reason why the Codex is important is because it covers a lot of things but DOESN’T cover everything. And a lot of what it covers and mandates can be exceptionally well-planned and pragmatic or pants-on-head stupid and careless. So how a space marine behaves while filling in as a Spartan largely depends on the Codex compliance of his native chapter.An all-in chapter like the Ultramarines would be highly disciplined with a strategy for almost everything but would suffer from a crippling lack of improvisation when faced with something the Codex doesn’t account for, which is likely in Halo where a space marine is a fish out of water. Likely to do well until their first big trip-up, in which case they fail and fail hard.A dissonant chapter could theoretically be anything, but in the case of my two earlier examples (Black Templars and Space Wolves), they would actually be pretty similar to my 2018 description of space marines: melee-obsessed murdermachines who charge into the thick of it en masse and hack everything to pieces. Excellent shock troops, but with the exception of Space Wolf scouts, not at all accustomed to the roles Spartans are meant to take and likely to die in their first engagement without support from other military forces. Especially if they’re only thirty strong like Spartans are.Your best bet would be a chapter that obeys the Codex but doesn't follow it blindly. These would be adaptable and skilled, with a wide knowledge base and the ability to improvise as the situation demands. They can be scouts, saboteurs, assassins, commandos, shock troops: everything a Spartan needs to be. In this case, they could be the heroes humanity needs.Side note: don’t try to randomize marines from different chapters. Unless they have a unique system akin to the Deathwatch, it’ll be pure chaos. Space marine chapters are often so wildly different in culture and doctrine that there’d be little hope for cohesion. They could work together, but never with the same coordination as chapter brothers, let alone Spartans.",43 followers,Aiken Sharratt,575,149,163.2K,2021,https://www.quora.com/Is-there-any-way-to-make-a-new-line-single-spaced-on-the-Quora-mobile-app

It is so big that most normal humans cannot wield it, let alone fire it.Let’s take an example:This Space Marine is carrying a heavy bolter, it’s like a bolter, butThe same gun requires a crew of 2 normal humans to effectively operate.Halo Spartans wield the same weaponry as the marines, normal calibers and normal sized weapons.Armor:While I don’t know the unique details involved in Mjolnir armor, we all know the suit enhances the Spartan’s physical feats. Making them stronger, faster, and all around more abled in combat. Same thing with Space Marines.However it is the durability I want to talk about. Of both the armor & the soldiers themselves.In Halo lore, Spartans are killed commonly by weapons considered weak by 40k standards. Plasma rifles, brute shots, plasma pistols, 7.62 rounds, .50 cals. Their armor is impressive. But weak by comparison.Space Marine armor is nearly impenetrable by small arms fire. Take the lasgun for instance.This rifle here can blow off limbs, explode body parts, and set you on fire. Powered up, it can punch through the most dense materials in the galaxy.This is considered weak by 40k standardsLasgun fire cannot penetrate space marine armor, see the image belowThis is a Space Marine literally standing still tanking dozens of shots while calmly firing his bolter back at the turret.Sum it up so far: In durability & ballistics, the Spartan is impressive for Halo. But stands no chance against Space Marines.I could stop here but I’m not going to.Now we must talk about reflexes, tactics, andWhen it comes to reflexes, Spartans are VERY fast. Space Marines are SLIGHTLY faster, literally SLAPPING BULLETS OUT OF THE AIR.When it comes to tactics, Spartans are used by the UNSC military as chess pieces. They take orders from common officers as attachments to regular platoons of marines.Space Marine chapters operate to their own accord. Oftentimes chapters will sendChaplin Grimaldus is placed in charge of an entire hive city. Monitoring everything from the readiness and positioning of city defenses, to the rations and guardsmen numbers within the city. He oversees it all for 9 days.And when it comes to melee, there is nothing the Spartan can do to compete with the marine. It’ll always end the same way.Your super soldiers are very impressive, Halo fans. However ours are simply better.But there’s a reason for that. Halo as a whole is a story about humanity trying to survive against the relentless onslaught of a superior foe. Spartans are made to give humanity a chance! Warhammer 40k isn’t about that at all. In Warhammer, humanity is the relentless onslaught. Space Marines are not realistic, they’re no dramatic, they’re made to be cool. And they are the coolest soldiers in any science fiction universe.",0 followers,Nick Schanz,719,0,0,2021,https://www.quora.com/Is-there-any-way-to-make-a-new-line-single-spaced-on-the-Quora-mobile-app
