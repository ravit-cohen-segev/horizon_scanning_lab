The technology element is to quickly transfer the usual plans into compatible plans for the 3D printers to be able to switch manufacturing within minutes if necessary.The current CoronaVirus pandemic has shown us that the current supply chain is far more fragile than originally thought. The idea that a manufacturing industry could be removed from the supply chain in a few days isn’t one anyone thought was possible, and so was never planned for. Now that it has happened, it will always appear on the risk analysis for global manufacture, and so the cost of the risk is established. The fix is to help manufacturers by converting all their products into 3D Printer ready files, which can be set to work at a moments notice.So, I wouldn’t invest in 3D Printers - I’d invest in the service of converting current drawings and molds into 3D printer files - that is the difficult part, and the one you can automate if you can find the best process.

5,"It’s kind of amazing how many ways After Earth went wrong. It was an embarrassment to everybody who worked on it, from the utterly listless performance by Will Smith to Jaden’s utter ineptitude in the lead role to the laughable script. Some movies have weak plots but keep themselves going on stellar dialogue. Not here.Some of the dialogue is meme-worthy in how stupid it is. We’re told as we approach an Earth that’s been abandoned by humanity that everything there evolved to kill us… while we’ve been absent?Of course the story is really special to me, fitting my interests.

Some movies have weak plots but keep themselves going on stellar dialogue. Not here.Some of the dialogue is meme-worthy in how stupid it is. We’re told as we approach an Earth that’s been abandoned by humanity that everything there evolved to kill us… while we’ve been absent?Of course the story is really special to me, fitting my interests. I love monster movies, and at its core, After Earth has a special focus on a monster, the Ursa. The Ursa is the main threat of the movie besides the overall time limit Jaden faces getting a signal out. It pursues him throughout the film, a looming, terrifying presence… that isn’t scary at all.The design isn’t terrible. I suppose it might spook some folks, but to me it’s rather dull. It’s grey and smooth and nearly devoid of features. Where’s the personality? Where’s the LOVE? This thing could be in ANY movie and it wouldn’t be out of place. It has no identity and an unmemorable silhouette. It’s also called the Ursa, which just straight up means bear. It’s like calling another planet Terra, which just means earth in another language. It’s lazy.A dull design can redeem itself with impressive writing, but the Ursa fails much, much harder on that front. I can understand people like the Ursa’s design, but its lore and behavior? Not so much. The Ursa was invented by an alien race (that we otherwise don’t see) that made them to kill all of humanity. This is a pretty steep task, and they certainly didn’t give it many tools to do the task.You see, the Ursa is blind. It hunts by scent, and only scent. Not hearing, even, judging by how casually people can pass by and be ignored so long as it doesn’t smell them. On top of that, it can only recognize people by specifically the hormones produced by fear. So not only are these creatures easily countered by simply shooting them from far away (they have no ability to attack from a distance) or from inside a sealed vehicle, but by a technique called “ghosting” where a person ceases to feel all fear.Obviously, this isn’t actually possible. You can suppress fear, but simply not feeling it cause you don’t want to is absurd. But people can do it in this movie, and Ursas are helpless against it. When Jaden, who has been running around in a jumpsuit without changing it for a week, stops feeling fear, the Ursa is instantly totally incapable of locating him. It can’t even smell his sweat, or the pheromones that he was still emitting seconds ago and should still be clinging to him. It’s embarrassing to watch it ineffectually flail about while Jaden kills it with a stick. Oh yeah, people don’t use guns to fight them, they use weird nanomachine swords. I guess they wanted to give the poor pathetic things a fighting chance.So how did it end up so bad? Well, two factors. One, Will Smith wanted to make Jaden a bigger star, so he shopped a script that would do that around. The film is very much allegorically about their relationship. Will’s character wants Jaden’s to be like him, and Jaden eventually rises to the occasion. In the movie, anyway. Jaden doesn’t become a good actor.Second, the script was accepted by M. Night Shymalan, who at the time was coming off of the massive failure that was the Last Airbender movie. It can be presumed that he was having trouble getting work at the time, because he apparently took this garbage script made as a blatant star vehicle for a nonexistent star without too much change. His awkward directing choices seem to have been the perfect storm with the laughable script, making a complete mess that nobody really appreciated. Least of all me. Ursa, you could have been better. It would have been hard to be worse.",UNKNOWN,Mercedes R. Lackey,537,20.3K,85.6M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-do-you-think-will-be-the-modern-worlds-next-technological-breakthrough
