If the Supreme Court and CAG were hyperactive and defiant during Manmohan Singh's tenure, an important reason was the structural weakness of the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government that robbed it of both cohesion and decisiveness. In fact, India Inc lost faith in the Congress party because theySrc:See how he justifies demise of Congress.

3,"This startup hasn't failed yet, but it may if we Indians don't change our mind set.Bounce, a startup which runs in Bangalore provides dockless scooters on rent. Dockless means that the scooters would be parked on a public parking or a road which doesn't have much traffic, and a person who needs one can find it on the Bounce app and start it with an OTP.He can then park it wherever he wants and the next person would pick it up from there.So, as there's no checking being done on who has rented the scooter and is it parked safely or not this is what we have done to the scooters.A bounce scooter tThis startup hasn't failed yet, but it may if we Indians don't change our mind set.Bounce, a startup which runs in Bangalore provides dockless scooters on rent.

Leave this, I've once seen a Bounce parked on the Hosur Road flyover!This is a bounce parked in a private property. People have started parking in their apartments and the others cannot take them because the apartment security doesn't allow to. I literally had to fight with the security of an apartment to let me take the scooter even though it was the fault of someone in their building.Moreover, people ruthlessly steal helmets provided by Bounce for free which you can use and keep it back in the boot after you've finished the ride.Sorry to the owners of Bounce, but this business model is surely not gonna work in India. We Indians don't deserve something like this.The idea is amazing though. It should be tried in other countries like Japan where this could be managed much better!Image source - Google.Edit -In these scooters supposedly the battery and GPS system is removed so the company probably can't track it (Not sure, if anyone knows they can tell me in comments)How much does a helmet cost? Free in Bangalore :) (This guy stole the Bounce helmet and using for his own bike)Why just the tires and battery?

A few innovations for your living room are eagerly anticipated in 2013 as well (Apple TV?).5) HD voice (wideband audio):HD voice delivers higher quality voice transmissions, providing users with more natural sounding speech. It has already been deployed in most developed countries but i am taking a gamble and saying HD Voice will become an industry standard with most handsets (iPhone 5 is already HD voice ready) and carriers adopting it.
