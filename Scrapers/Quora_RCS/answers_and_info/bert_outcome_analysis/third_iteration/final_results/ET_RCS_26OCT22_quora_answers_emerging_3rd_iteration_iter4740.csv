It is a waste of money.--China can, with ease, defeat the US in a war! America, somehow, lost its ability to continue to be the ‘Greatest Military Power’ a while ago it seems and to also lose its place as the No 1 economy.America of today is NOT the America of even 20 years ago.If America cannot give up on attacking others to maintain its place in the world then it will become weaker and weaker, become less relevant and less respected.

It’s the first time a country could very well precipitate the disaster of the USD not being the world’s reserve currency, thus forcing the US to actually care about its debt.But why? Chinese people simply do not have anything comparable to the wealth and consumption of Americans. Adjusting per capita, Chinese GDP is merely on par with Mexico,And yet we hear about the rise of China. Why?It’s because the US lacks levers to control China. The US is decades deep into a strategic decision that has made it wildly vulnerable to more financially responsible nations. This is why US foreign policy refuses to acknowledge statistics that are adjusted per capita; the absolute power of China is the problem, not that Chinese people are richer or lead better lives.The rise of China isn’t really relative to its ability to affect other countries using hard or soft power, nor is it based off of willingness. It is merely China’s capacity to threaten the US that makes for this particular story. And mere misunderstandings can stoke paranoia to which China has no meaningful way to address.Exactly what emergent Chinese soft power am I supposed to marvel at here? Who thinks that China can address this with their own soft power tools?A prudent mind would observe that some of this paranoia needs to be checked by China’s actions during the Great Financial Crisis in 2008.What China has right now isn’t soft power. It’s momentum.And anyone arguing that China has hard power needs to deeply consider why the conversation is about sinking all of China’s fleet in 72 hours for a conflict right off its shores.","3,719 followers",Thomas Pauken II,2K,1K,17.3M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-do-people-really-mean-when-they-talk-about-the-rise-of-China-Although-China-is-slightly-larger-than-the-US-it-has-1-4-billion-compared-to-330-million-Could-China-ever-really-replace-the-US-hard-power-soft

Not understanding that it’s actually a name and the name of the Chinese leader Xi.so mark off the cultural power or influence of the Chinese because it doesn’t exist.the economy is not stable and it is dependent on exporting goods like a new born depends on their mother for milk.their domestic power grids heavily rely just as much on the outside world as their economy, ever since they stopped heavily importing coal for their power from Australia they are having constant Black outs.their soldiers are not equipped very well compared to the US soldiers.3/5 of Chinese soldiers suffer from some form of metal health specifically anxiety, depression and also some form of psychotic tendencies.most of the Chinese soldiers are in the military because the alternative is starvation on the streets.their military technology in the subs are from the 60s and are very noisy.so you tell me if this sounds like a superpower to you:40 million children on the streets starving and alone.Chinese culture no one cares about nor even knows it exists.their military technology is that of the 60s for the most part.3/5 of their soldiers suffer from some form of mental health mentioned above and they are there so they don’t go hungry.most of their skyscrapers and infrastructure is terrible due to embezzlement.they are for the most part not self sufficient for their power grids.their economy is extremely reliant on the western world and without the US, Europe and CANZUK countries they would go bankrupt and go back to a pile of dirt mud huts.does this sound like China will be a superpower in the next 100 years?CANZUK is closer to being a superpower before China and CANZUK isn’t even fully formed yet.does this answer the question?",101 followers,Anthony Galli,813,300,5.7M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-do-people-really-mean-when-they-talk-about-the-rise-of-China-Although-China-is-slightly-larger-than-the-US-it-has-1-4-billion-compared-to-330-million-Could-China-ever-really-replace-the-US-hard-power-soft

Our team at Grammarly has compiled a handy list of common grammatical errors to help make your writing accurate, clear, and professional.Ambiguous (“Squinting”) modifiersA squinting modifier is a misplaced modifier that, because of its location in a sentence, could modify either the phrase that precedes it or the one that follows it. In the example sentence, is the subject listening to music slowly or slowly getting a headache? To correct a squinting modifier, move its position in the sentence to clarify to the reader which word you intend to modify.Misuse of lie/layIf you plan to place or put an object somewhere, such as a plate on a table, you should use “lay.” If you intend to stretch out on a bed for a nap, you should use “lie.” The verb “lie” is an intransitive verb, which means it does not need an object. The transitive verb “lay” requires an object.It may take some getting used to this “lay” or “lie” business; after all, misuse of these verbs is common. But if you remember to lay down your fork before you’re full, then you won’t have to lie down later from overeating.Comma splicesHe was very hungry, so he ate a whole pizza.To splice means to connect or join. When a writer joins two independent sentences with a comma instead of separating them with a period or coordinating conjunction, that’s a comma splice.The comma has its jobs to do, but connecting two independent sentences isn’t one of them. Besides, the period gets testy when his sister, the comma, steals his thunder. Periods have their jobs, and so do commas, but never the twain shall meet—unless it’s in the form of a semicolon. Semicolons can also take the place of a coordinating conjunction, such as “and,” “but,” or “so,” among others.Run-on sentencesRun-on sentences, also known as fused sentences, occur when two complete sentences are squashed together without using a coordinating conjunction or proper punctuation, such as a period or a semicolon. Run-on sentences can be short or long. A long sentence isn’t necessarily a run-on sentence.To avoid run-on sentences, see if there is more than one idea communicated by two or more independent clauses. In our examples, there are two complete sentences:Example:Example:Both sentences are complete ideas by themselves; therefore, use a semicolon or a period to indicate that they are separate independent clauses.Using “could of” instead of “could have”“Could have” is always correct; “could of” never is. Writers probably make this grammar gaffe because, when we speak, the contraction “could’ve” sounds an awful lot like “could of.”TautologiesTautologies express the same thing twice with different words.

The new immigrants were not farmers who passed right through the Eastern states looking to homestead on the frontier; they were urbanized, but they were also from cultures long accustomed to family business. They did not practice the Anglo-Saxon Victorian conceit that women and children were never to be used for economic purposes. Making Mann’s schools compulsory became the way to break the hold of immigrant parents over their children.As the Progressive Era loomed another two generations later, first John Dewey reviewed Mann’s schools, adding some Tayloristic assembly-line methods, then Edward Thorndike added some behaviorist techniques andYou know all the features as you almost certainly lived it yourself:But the key features wereThis is a big load of statist crap. In fact, it is a master course in thwarting any possibility of self-actualization.

Even being inclined to believe him and having had the opportunity to speak with a wide variety of educators who attended his (packed) speeches, I could find no corroborating literature whatsoever.So, I scheduled a meeting with Nell Noddings, Stanford’s professor of the history of education (nowNeedless to say, we have yet to rid ourselves of this phony “education” that substitutes pure and pernicious statism in place of our most liberal-in-the-world founding values.So… what then?We sent our sons to a school founded by a bunch of Quakers in California in 1925. They wrote to John Dewey seeking one of his ablest grad students as their director. A few weeks after she arrived, they paid her way back to Chicago and decided that if they simply did pretty much the opposite of the Dewey approach on each point, they could not go far wrong.It was a stupendous educational experience.But consider the overarching fallacy behind education today: If the goal of education is to help our youth succeed in the real world, they should learn in the real world.

Therefore the smoothbore musket was still king, with an effective range of 100 yards maximum.By 1860, fast loading rifles were the new standard weapon for infantry, greatly increasing their effective range. One of the first examples of the new weapon’s effectiveness at range was in 1853 at Sevastopol. 2,500 Russian cavalry charged 500 soldiers of the 93rd (Sutherland Highlanders). The 93rd engaged them effectively at a range of 800 yards, and then again at 500 yards with a second volley (showing how quickly they were able to reload), causing the charge to be stopped in its tracks. The engagement was known as The Thin Red Line and celebrated with wildly inaccurate paintings (the Russians were never that close).But the key learning from this engagement was that infantry could now engage enemies at range, and the days of Napoleonic columns and cavalry charges were done.Therefore, your battle between 1810 British and 1860 American soldiers would almost certainly result in the British being engaged at ranges that they couldn’t possibly match, and a fairly simple victory for the Yanks.EDIT: Loads of great points in the comments about the specific armies in 1810 and 1860 - the likelihood is that the battle hardened British Army of the Peninsula War would thrash the tiny, inexperienced and poorly trained Army of pre-Civil War America, regardless of equipment.

He was on patrol, out of the confines of the base that he was to live in. He stepped on some recently disturbed dirt.A small patch of dirt. What danger could it hold?He jumped 30 foot in the air. His gun flew from his shattered hand. One leg was blown off to the thigh, his knee just not there anymore. The other resembled mince meat, held together by the ragged scraps of his combat trousers. He hit the floor. Alive, breathing, awake. The closest man was too far away, the whole squad had hit the ground waiting for bullets or more bombs.He reached down, and with his right arm, the only limb he had intact, pulled tourniquets on both his legs tight to slow the bleeding. And then he rammed his own morphine injection into himself.What would you have done? It's a common saying “you don't rise to the occasion, you fall back on your training”.
