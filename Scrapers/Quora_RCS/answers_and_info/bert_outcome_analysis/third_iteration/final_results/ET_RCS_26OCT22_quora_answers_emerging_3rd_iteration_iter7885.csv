The resource of the earth are absolutely enough for several times as many humans as there are alive today to enjoy a standard of living far higher than anyone knows today. Getting there would take technological breakthroughs in the way we extract resources and get cheap energy because we aren't very good at using those resources right now.The mass of the Earth is 5.972 x 10^21 tons. The amount of iron mined in a year is around around 3 X 10^9 tons. Obviously the entire earth is not made of iron and there are many other resources we need. But we can see that the amount we are using is very small. And even then we're not always extracting it efficiently or getting all of it. I won't consider the possibility of synthesizing or recycling resource as the existing amount is already much more than we use.Any advancement that makes critical resources cheaper or more efficient to extract would vastly increase the amount we have to work with. Aluminum used to cost thousands of times as much as it does now before better extraction processes were invented.Of course all of this needs energy. According to some claims, we are using about 0.01% of the energy that the sun sends to the Earth currently. That's also not counting geothermal energy coming from the core of the Earth and other forms of stored energy such as atomic energy (which is a potentially vast amount since a small amount of the right elements produces a lot of energy).I'm not sure if there is some other way to capture additional energy, for example through tides (generated by the lunar orbit) or by using the motion of the Earth through magnetic fields to capture energy (using the planet as a large generator).And I'm not going into space-based resource gathering since we don't really do it at all now. That could potentially multiply the amount of certain resources that are available to us.We are surrounded by a vast amount of resources or energy. We are literally only scratching the surface of the Earth to get what we need and it's not like we're shooting a lot of stuff into space so we can figure out how to re-use resources when it makes sense. If we knew how to get even a fraction of what we are aware of now we wouldn't know what to do with it (but give it 100 years and I'm sure we can get creative). And over time we may discover other ways of accessing and using resources that we can't even imagine now.To not get too utopian here, all of this comes at a cost. The cost of extracting, producing, and transporting resources can be brought back to energy. So cheaper energy means that every resource is easier to get to including more energy. Currently fossil fuels are one of the cheapest, most widely-available, and most reliable ways to get energy.Thomas Malthus was one of the most famous predictors of our doom due to limited resource. He happened to live around the start of the industrial revolution that kicked off the greatest growth in humanity and wealth ever seen in history. Looking back now we can only agree on one thing -- the way we used resources at that time was incredibly primitive and wouldn't support a large population. Fortunately that changed very quickly. Who knows what will happen in another 200 years?We will need technological and societal advancement to see this happen. The good news is that having a higher population density tends to make advancements happen faster. Bringing up the standard of living in all countries as the global population grows means that we have more minds to raise the standard of living. That is the ultimate resource. Without our intelligence and the productivity we got through trade we would be huddling around a fire using sticks to fend off predators.",1 follower,Xitong Zou,6.1K,3K,11.9M,2016,https://www.quora.com/Are-the-resources-in-the-Earth-enough-for-all-humans-to-enjoy-the-living-standards-of-developed-countries
2,"At a basic level, there are 2 resource types: material and energy. For almost all elements, we can reuse atoms indefinitely without wearing them out.

We don’t currently have a cost effective technology to harvest and store this large quantity of solar energy. But sunlight isn’t the only energy source. (footnote: hydro and wind are secondary sunlight energy forms, waves are tertiary derived from wind.) There are four other sources: orbital energy of the moon (tides), radioactive decay heat (geothermal), heavy metal fission, and light element fusion. The first two are insignificant compared to the latter. We have the technology in hand to do heavy metal fission and even fusion could be practical usingIn the near term, we are limited by technological understanding and investment capital. There’s a difference between things we know how to do and things that still need to be invented. For example, we know how to extract Uranium from sea water and we know how much it will cost. We know how to build nuclear power plants like the IFR or the Terrapower reactor that will burn a large fraction of all Uranium. We even know how to build nuclear power plants like the MSR which will burn Thorium. We don’t yet know how to collect solar energy at high efficiency (limiting natural land requirements) and low enough cost (high enough ERoEI) to improve lifestyle while transitioning from fossil fuels. We know even less about how to do non-bomb nuclear fusion energy production. However, in the longer term timescale, technology advances. 50 or 100 years is a really long time in technology development these days. I fully expect that some of the solar energy, energy storage, and plasma fusion control technologies will become cost effective within 100 years changing everything.The interesting question isn’t what is possible, but what will the rates of development be compared to the dynamics of resource depletion and climate change. We will have resource squeezes such as fresh water shortages and we will change the climate with fossil carbon emissions. How bad these problems get depends on how quickly we develop and deploy the technologies of fission, fusion, solar collection and storage, and desalination.",0 followers,Jimmy Thomas,8.2K,282,2.3M,2016,https://www.quora.com/Are-the-resources-in-the-Earth-enough-for-all-humans-to-enjoy-the-living-standards-of-developed-countries

The real problem of world hunger is a political one. The United States alone produces enough food to feed several large countries so certainly we have more than enough if all other countries could be made to produce that much, perhaps through technology. The reason that a billion people starve every day is because they live in countries that have governments who care nothing for those ""useless eaters"" and would horde what little resource their country have for extravagant lifestyle even as their people starve. It is unfortunately not unlike Feudalistic Europe. If they had a government with the same level of democracy as the US with a culture that supports it (as in, not being totally dependent on governments for their welfare and holding those governments accountable to their people), they could prosper with what they have and we wouldn't have a billion people starving every day. Unfortunately most countries sees the government in a very top down way rather than a power that cooperates with the people for the benefit of the country.As others have said, there are more than enough out there, all it takes is technological breakthrough to extract them, increased energy to foster extraction, and a recycling program to reuse what we do have. Fusion energy sounds good, but nuclear fission is what we can use right NOW. I still think that fusion energy will have their own set of danger and drawback, and we as a society needs to learn to reduce those risks, and not cast them aside like they are evil. Nuclear fission can produce large quantity of energy for very little input material, is carbon neutral and is a viable alternative to fossil fuel. It should be built on a geologically stable location, but other than that it doesn't really matter where you build them as long as they're away from people. In places where the sun doesn't shine as much as we like to solar is next to useless. Wind power isn't all it's cracked up to be. It kills birds, and it really can't produce anywhere near the energy required to replace fossil fuel. Germany has a LOT of wind turbines, and when they decided to go nuclear free they had to turn to fossil fuel. Japan reactivated their nuclear power because there just isn't any viable alternative and green energy produces far too little for the amount of space they require.We may not always be able to live in giant houses and drive big SUV but increased population density is actually better for developments that would reduce an individual's ecological footprint.

The thing is we have to take a look at the innards of a country to really know whether or not you are truly developed. That Chinese are so obsessed with portraying the facade that they are technologically advanced and ahead is actually an indication that they have not fully developed yet. Because fully developed countries have no need to show off things like that. Everyone knows they are developed.For example, here is San Francisco:Look, not many skyscrapers right? And look at those old cable cars going around! That must mean they are undeveloped right? Nope. Everyone knows San Francisco is a developed city. That’s why it has no need to show off with luxury skyscrapers and such things.Or how about Florence, Italy?Again, no skyscrapers here. But everyone knows it’s a developed city and Italy is a developed country.My point is, you have got to look at the people and the innards of a country to truly know if they are developed.This is the true face of China:You have got to look at the average person. Does the average Chinese have good access to healthcare (which is ranked near the bottom in WHO rankings btw)? Can they drink tap water safely? Do they have access to quality food? Do all have access to electricity or paved roads or a quality education? The answer is: probably, yes, if you are living in the rich east coast provinces of Jiangsu or Zhejiang or Guangdong- but not if you are living in say - Xinjiang or Gansu or Tibet. China’s wealth is not spread equally, neither is it developed equally. Even though the CCP has developed China quite fast - there is still a lot of work to be done making sure *every Chinese* have equal access to everything.And then you got to look at the attitude of the people. When I was in China I found that you really got to look out for who you trust, because there is a lot of scams going on all the time. You never know what is real, what is fake, what is real price of anything. Why do these scams exist? Because people have to be desperate to make money that’s why.Why are people desperate to make money? Probably because they are not making enough to survive, which is an indication that the country is still developing. You’ll notice that in general, the more developed a country is, the less likely there will be scams. In Korea/Japan/Taiwan, you will not find very many scams. In China and Eastern Europe it’s likely.Another aside I want to note is that Chinese bathrooms don’t contain any toilet paper. Do you know the reason why? It’s because people steal it. Now, in what developed country does this happen? I can’t think of any. Only in a developing country would you need to bring your own toilet paper to the bathroom because there isn’t any there due to fear of people stealing it.I find GDP/capita to be generally a pretty good indicator of how developed a country is. The average GDP/capita (PPP) of China is still around $8k/person. While that is higher than most Asian countries - it’s still below the 4 East Asian tigers + Japan and far from the $62k/person that the USA has.The true measure of a developed society is to observe the people that live in the country and not the appearance of the country itself. Chinese “face” culture is the same. You can just obviously see that China has developed really really fast, and mentality wise people are still harping about luxury products and consumerism - this is where Americans were back in the 50s, 60s and 70s, not now.The biggest consumers of luxury products are Chinese people, not Americans or Europeans. The more developed you are, the less need you have to validate your self worth with materialism. The less desire you have to spend thousands of dollars on your children's schooling just to send them to be educated abroad. The less need to travel to countries like Canada or USA for giving birth so that your child becomes a US or Canadian citizen, or to launder your money by buying up real estate in other countries. Developed countries do not need to do things like that.Thats why you should always pay attention to the old adage -Edit:Of course, Chinese commenters love to bring up the USA. Yes, USA has lots of impoverished areas too; every country has developed areas and undeveloped areas, however my point is that for China there is significantly more undeveloped areas at a higher % compared to the USA. The poverty rate for China is 16% as of 2019 and for USA it is 1.5% as of 2019.

My former father-in-law also worked at Lawrence Berkeley Labs, and was an engineer designing superconducting coil magnets and had decades of experience working with fusion researchers, even though his primary application was particle accelerators. From having many long conversations with these very intelligent and qualified people I realized that there are some really hard problems that block practical fusion, with no immediate solutions in sight.The only place we know of working, large-scale, energy-generating fusion reactions is at the center of a star, where the gravity of the massive star creates the necessary density, temperature, and time being held in that state at the core for fusion reactions to run continuously. This is called the Lawson criteria, and is hard to achieve. All of the layers of the star above that act as an energy exchanger, converting all the gamma rays and fast neutrons at the core into progressively less energetic wavelengths of light and motion of nuclei (heat) so by the time they reach the surface of the star, that energy is emitted as IR and visible light that heats and powers our planet's biosphere, and can provide photovoltaic energy to us as well. All of our efforts in fusion have been to try and reproduce this process on earth, in a small reactor that can provide practical energy.First I will talk aboutThe first problem with magnetic confinement is fundamental - no matter how strong or well formed the magnetic field containing the plasma is, it will always leak, as positive nuclei or ions spiralling around the magnetic field lines collide and scatter, eventually drifting out of the containment field. The only known solution is to make the reactor larger so the scattering ions take longer to travel to the plasma boundary, and thus more fusion can happen during that time. Pretty brute force.The world's most advanced magnetic confinement fusion power plant is ITER, which, to reduce the ion scattering problem mentioned above, is 6-stories tall and about the same dimension in diameter, containing the mass of 3 Eiffel towers, and it is still not expected to be large enough to contain a plasma long enough to sustain burning and produce continuous energy generation.A more practical problem is how do we extract the energy? Most of the energy in deuterium-tritium fusion reactions is released in fast, high-energy neutrons, which (because they are neutral, and have no electric charge) are not confined by the magnetic field, don't heat up the plasma, and have to be stopped by a thick shield, which then heats up, and can vaporize water to steam in order to power turbines and electrical generators. The problem is the constant bombardment by neutrons makes the shield material degrade with time, and become very radioactive, posing a problem for removal and disposal.Also, deuterium-tritium fusion reactions are currently used because they take place at the lowest energies and at the lowest plasma temperatures of all the possible fusion fuels, and thus are easier to ignite and keep lit. However, tritium is not found naturally in any significant quantities and needs to be manufactured in nuclear reactors. With today's production capacity, we just cannot make enough tritium to power even ITER continuously. We could use better fuels, like Helium-3 or Boron-11, which do not emit neutrons and thus 'burn clean', but the plasma temperature must be much higher and the confinement much better to ignite fusion and sustain it with these fuels. And while Boron-11 is plentiful, Helium-3 is so rare that scientists think that the best source of it is lunar regolith that has been irradiated for billions of years on the moon's surface. Any energy generation infrastructure that requires a regular supply of a moon-based fuel, even as energy dense as He3, will probably never work out.A proposed solution to the Tritium deficit is to construct the shield surrounding the reactor with lithium, which is abundant, and fissions into tritium when struck by neutrons, thereby 'breeding' tritium within the reactor itself. Of course, this comes with its own set of problems of how to capture, purify, and contain the tritium after it is released into the tokamak reaction chamber from the walls.Another issue is that when all of the superconducting magnets in ITER are running at full current (160,000 amps) to create the 13 Tesla toroidal magnetic field (13x that in an MRI machine) and to create the other plasma-shaping and heating fields, they are storing 60 GigaJoules, or around 12 Tons of TNT worth of energy. This is because the 180 kilometers of superconducting Niobium-Tin wires in all these massive magnet coils can carry enormous electrical current when supercooled with liquid helium.More info on the ITER magnets:But, if that cooling fails, the superconductor heats up, quenches, and becomes a normal conductor, and can no longer carry that enormous current. With 160,000 amps suddenly meeting resistance, the coil rapidly vaporizes, and causes a meltdown of the other coils, with a total energy release of 12 tons of TNT. This is very undesirable, especially when those coils are wrapped around a highly radioactive shield that also vaporizes and is expelled into the atmosphere. There are fault-detection systems, but it takes a while to dissipate that amount of energy safely, and there may not be enough time to react quickly enough in the event of a catastrophic magnet coil failure.So, some gotchas left to solve for practical fusion energy generation with magnetic confinement, with some perhaps not so easily solved.Inertial confinement fusionIt also has many of the same problems with energy conversion to electricity, and much worse wear and tear on the shielding from these small nuclear fusion explosions being set off, which also trashes all the precision equipment needed to hold the fuel pellet in the focus of the converging laser beams with extreme accuracy. So, a lot of practical damage control problems before inertial confinement fusion is a practical source of energy generation.While these problems may be solved, practical application is still a very long way off, and currently the main application of inertial confinement fusion is as an experimental testbed for calibrating computer codes used to simulate and design thermonuclear fusion weapons. As horrific as these weapons may be, the simulation codes developed for designing them (sorry maintaining them), are the one of the greatest tools for innovation in fusion energy. There is a hydrodynamics code which simulates the behavior of the fissile (and fusion) materials under extreme conditions of pressure and temperature, as well as transport codes that model neutron transport and scattering in the materials under these conditions, and many other bits and bobs. They are all standard numerical techniques, and the really classified part is the integration and calibration of all these codes with previous nuclear weapon tests from the past, and with these small scale simulations in the present.Electrostatic Confinement FusionBasically you need a vacuum container the size of a basketball and a pump to empty it. You put a small spherical wire cage the size of a golf ball in the center, and a larger wire cage the size of a bowling ball around it. You then pump out all the air, and apply a very large (10,000V) electrical potential between the two cages, with the small negative cathode at the center, and the positive anode at the periphery.Then you open a valve and let in a very small amount of Deuterium gas (commercially available) into the vacuum chamber, and it ionizes in the large voltage potential, the D+ ions in the periphery experience a very strong electric field (100K V/m), and are rapidly accelerated towards the center of the reactor, with enough energy to collide and fuse the deuterium nuclei (no tritium required). This fusion can be measured with an external neutron counter.Theoretically, power generation would be simple, as the fusion products consisting of highly energetic He3 and (few) H3 ions could be decelerated in an electric field and the current from that used to generate electricity directly.Here is ECG Herman’s excellent thesis paper on designing and constructing a Farnsworth Fusor:Although they seem like a obvious winners due to their simplicity and effectiveness, ECF reactors have several things limiting scaling:a) There is a limit to the deuterium gas density before performance degrades, so generation capacity is limited.b) Deuterium ions tend to collide with the wire cage cathode in the center, which absorbs them, heating the cage, and causing energy loss and contamination from metal atoms being dislodged.c) As the deuterium ions oscillate back and forth through the center, each time they change direction, they emit bremsstrahlung radiation, or photons of light, losing energy (this is how your dentist’s x-ray machine works).d) Scattering tends to reduce the nice, radial trajectories of the ions into a Maxwellian distribution over time, reducing the fusion that occurs.There has been work in using electromagnets at the periphery to try and hold a ball of electrons in the center, eliminating the need for a central cage… akaThermonuclear WeaponsIn the Teller-Ulam, two-stage, thermonuclear weapon, a spherical plutonium fission primary (with deuterium-tritium fusion fuel at the core to boost it) is imploded by conventional explosives, the plutonium is crushed far beyond critical density, fissions and detonates. The initial radiation released is contained and focused onto the fusion secondary to implode it, ignite fusion, and detonate it. I just mention this to illustrate the enormous energy needed to really reach the Lawson criteria in a large scale, but nuclear weapons kind of freak me out, so I'm going to refer you to the link to the Wikipedia article about them if you want to read more:Thermonuclear weapon - WikipediaSo, in summary, we should not shut down or stop building today's fission nuclear reactors, as commercial fusion reactors are not only far in the future, but also produce radioactive waste (their shielding, which needs to be periodically replaced), and Tokamaks can melt down catastrophically and explode if there is a cooling failure in the magnet coils during full power operation. They also do not run on seawater, like some say. We need expensive and difficult to produce tritium (which is also radioactive) to ignite fusion at the temperatures and densities that today's tokamak magnetic fields can produce.To advance fusion energy in your career, I think the best fields to study would be physics (classical, electrodynamics, plasma, quantum, nuclear…) and computer science, with a focus on numerical simulation. The actual physical fusion reactors are so expensive and time-consuming to build, test, and operate, that you may only get to iterate designs once or twice in a career, but computer simulations can take us in so many different directions more cheaply and easily by comparison.Perhaps there is some exotic stellarator magnetic confinement design, or advanced Farnsworth electrostatic confinement design that has not been explored in depth, that will turn out to hold the key to fusion energy. Simulation is probably the best first step to find it, unless you have a few billion dollars and several hundred kilometers of Niobium-Tin wire and helium cooling tubing to play with.Brent","220,635 followers",Franklin Veaux,3.2K,47.3K,783.1M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Are-the-resources-in-the-Earth-enough-for-all-humans-to-enjoy-the-living-standards-of-developed-countries

Nuclear fusion is based on the following chemical reaction mechanism;3 tritium 1 + 2 deuterium 1 react to 4 helium 2 + emitted neutronThe below explanation of the hydrogen particle the deuterium particle and the tritium particle are on my Quora site along with explanations of the nuclear structure and isotope explanations including containment of particles in nuclear orbitals. 3 tritium 1 is a hydrogen particle with a hydrogen particle and a negatron in orbit of the hydrogen particle nucleus and 2 deuterium 1 is a hydrogen particle with a hydrogen particle in the orbitals of the hydrogen particle with 4 helium 2 being a hydrogen particle with two hydrogen particles and a negatron in the orbitals with the neutron being emitted as a hydrogen particle. The hydrogen particle is observed as a neutron as the hydrogen particle is neutral as the nuclear charge is balanced by the minute weighted electromagnetic energy particulates surrounding the nucleus of hydrogen particle. This creates a huge chain reaction under intense heat and pressure.Deuterium Is A Hydrogen Particle With A Hydrogen Particle In The Orbitals And Tritium Is A Hydrogen Particle With A Hydrogen Particle And A Negatron In The OrbitalsDeuterium is a hydrogen particle as described below with a positively charged particulate in the orbitals. The hydrogen bond formed in D2O is stronger than H2O as deuterium is a larger particle and attracts the minute weighted electromagnetic energy particulates more strongly than the hydrogen particle due to the positive charge of the additional hydrogen particle in the orbitals. Tritium is a hydrogen particle with two particles in the orbitals a hydrogen particle and a negatron as the negatively charged equivalent of a hydrogen particle in the same orbital for balance.Hydrogen Is A ParticleA proton cannot exist singularly as there must be stability in combining with at least one neutron and with neutrons and protons. Helium is therefore the lightest element as a proton and neutron combined with an electromagnetic energy field for charge balance. Hydrogen Is a particle with an electromagnetic field surrounding the particle for charge balance and is in quadrants positively charged less negatively charged positively charged and less negatively charged and an antimatter high density metallic core to spin the particle around the vertical axis and bind the quadrants. This is why hydrogen gives up the electromagnetic energy field more easily than expected and therefore forms hydrogen bonding such as in water, which enables life to exist. The charged quadrants of the hydrogen particle provide stability and allow the hydrogen particle to be a free ion with the honeycomb structured particle filling the space inside the field of weighted electromagnetic energy particulates. The structure of subatomic particles such as neutrinos and subneutrinos is made up in the same way with a field of electromagnetic energy particulates with weight surrounding the honeycomb structured particulates with varied charge depending on the charge arrangement of the particles quadrants.

The latest research findings from Princeton Physics Laboratory in collusion with a Max Planck researcher has even lower the stakes to kick start a fusion reaction in a tokamak. In a conventional doughnut shaped tokamaks the traditional approach was to use solenoids to launch, heat and bottle the hot plasma at the Centre line of the tokamak (to ionize the injection of a gas stream, stripping them of electrons converting the gas into a plasma) so that it could be manipulated by the powerful magnetic fields and kept away from the walls of the reactor vessel. The new research has also found that in a spheroidal tokamak, electrodes could kickstart converting gas at room temperature using specially positioned electrodes to ignite the fusion reaction by converting the gas into plasma by the transient Coaxial Helical injection process dispensing with space consuming solenoids. Scaling up of the rector may be done by the Tokamak Scaling Code that was developed by one of the lead researchers.In conclusion, with the update, the entrance fee into Fusion technology has just been lowered and more progress is expected in the years ahead.Ref:DOE/Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory.

My former father-in-law also worked at Lawrence Berkeley Labs, and was an engineer designing superconducting coil magnets and had decades of experience working with fusion researchers, even though his primary application was particle accelerators. From having many long conversations with these very intelligent and qualified people I realized that there are some really hard problems that block practical fusion, with no immediate solutions in sight.The only place we know of working, large-scale, energy-generating fusion reactions is at the center of a star, where the gravity of the massive star creates the necessary density, temperature, and time being held in that state at the core for fusion reactions to run continuously. This is called the Lawson criteria, and is hard to achieve. All of the layers of the star above that act as an energy exchanger, converting all the gamma rays and fast neutrons at the core into progressively less energetic wavelengths of light and motion of nuclei (heat) so by the time they reach the surface of the star, that energy is emitted as IR and visible light that heats and powers our planet's biosphere, and can provide photovoltaic energy to us as well. All of our efforts in fusion have been to try and reproduce this process on earth, in a small reactor that can provide practical energy.First I will talk aboutThe first problem with magnetic confinement is fundamental - no matter how strong or well formed the magnetic field containing the plasma is, it will always leak, as positive nuclei or ions spiralling around the magnetic field lines collide and scatter, eventually drifting out of the containment field. The only known solution is to make the reactor larger so the scattering ions take longer to travel to the plasma boundary, and thus more fusion can happen during that time. Pretty brute force.The world's most advanced magnetic confinement fusion power plant is ITER, which, to reduce the ion scattering problem mentioned above, is 6-stories tall and about the same dimension in diameter, containing the mass of 3 Eiffel towers, and it is still not expected to be large enough to contain a plasma long enough to sustain burning and produce continuous energy generation.A more practical problem is how do we extract the energy? Most of the energy in deuterium-tritium fusion reactions is released in fast, high-energy neutrons, which (because they are neutral, and have no electric charge) are not confined by the magnetic field, don't heat up the plasma, and have to be stopped by a thick shield, which then heats up, and can vaporize water to steam in order to power turbines and electrical generators. The problem is the constant bombardment by neutrons makes the shield material degrade with time, and become very radioactive, posing a problem for removal and disposal.Also, deuterium-tritium fusion reactions are currently used because they take place at the lowest energies and at the lowest plasma temperatures of all the possible fusion fuels, and thus are easier to ignite and keep lit. However, tritium is not found naturally in any significant quantities and needs to be manufactured in nuclear reactors. With today's production capacity, we just cannot make enough tritium to power even ITER continuously. We could use better fuels, like Helium-3 or Boron-11, which do not emit neutrons and thus 'burn clean', but the plasma temperature must be much higher and the confinement much better to ignite fusion and sustain it with these fuels. And while Boron-11 is plentiful, Helium-3 is so rare that scientists think that the best source of it is lunar regolith that has been irradiated for billions of years on the moon's surface. Any energy generation infrastructure that requires a regular supply of a moon-based fuel, even as energy dense as He3, will probably never work out.A proposed solution to the Tritium deficit is to construct the shield surrounding the reactor with lithium, which is abundant, and fissions into tritium when struck by neutrons, thereby 'breeding' tritium within the reactor itself. Of course, this comes with its own set of problems of how to capture, purify, and contain the tritium after it is released into the tokamak reaction chamber from the walls.Another issue is that when all of the superconducting magnets in ITER are running at full current (160,000 amps) to create the 13 Tesla toroidal magnetic field (13x that in an MRI machine) and to create the other plasma-shaping and heating fields, they are storing 60 GigaJoules, or around 12 Tons of TNT worth of energy. This is because the 180 kilometers of superconducting Niobium-Tin wires in all these massive magnet coils can carry enormous electrical current when supercooled with liquid helium.More info on the ITER magnets:But, if that cooling fails, the superconductor heats up, quenches, and becomes a normal conductor, and can no longer carry that enormous current. With 160,000 amps suddenly meeting resistance, the coil rapidly vaporizes, and causes a meltdown of the other coils, with a total energy release of 12 tons of TNT. This is very undesirable, especially when those coils are wrapped around a highly radioactive shield that also vaporizes and is expelled into the atmosphere. There are fault-detection systems, but it takes a while to dissipate that amount of energy safely, and there may not be enough time to react quickly enough in the event of a catastrophic magnet coil failure.So, some gotchas left to solve for practical fusion energy generation with magnetic confinement, with some perhaps not so easily solved.Inertial confinement fusionIt also has many of the same problems with energy conversion to electricity, and much worse wear and tear on the shielding from these small nuclear fusion explosions being set off, which also trashes all the precision equipment needed to hold the fuel pellet in the focus of the converging laser beams with extreme accuracy. So, a lot of practical damage control problems before inertial confinement fusion is a practical source of energy generation.While these problems may be solved, practical application is still a very long way off, and currently the main application of inertial confinement fusion is as an experimental testbed for calibrating computer codes used to simulate and design thermonuclear fusion weapons. As horrific as these weapons may be, the simulation codes developed for designing them (sorry maintaining them), are the one of the greatest tools for innovation in fusion energy. There is a hydrodynamics code which simulates the behavior of the fissile (and fusion) materials under extreme conditions of pressure and temperature, as well as transport codes that model neutron transport and scattering in the materials under these conditions, and many other bits and bobs. They are all standard numerical techniques, and the really classified part is the integration and calibration of all these codes with previous nuclear weapon tests from the past, and with these small scale simulations in the present.Electrostatic Confinement FusionBasically you need a vacuum container the size of a basketball and a pump to empty it. You put a small spherical wire cage the size of a golf ball in the center, and a larger wire cage the size of a bowling ball around it. You then pump out all the air, and apply a very large (10,000V) electrical potential between the two cages, with the small negative cathode at the center, and the positive anode at the periphery.Then you open a valve and let in a very small amount of Deuterium gas (commercially available) into the vacuum chamber, and it ionizes in the large voltage potential, the D+ ions in the periphery experience a very strong electric field (100K V/m), and are rapidly accelerated towards the center of the reactor, with enough energy to collide and fuse the deuterium nuclei (no tritium required). This fusion can be measured with an external neutron counter.Theoretically, power generation would be simple, as the fusion products consisting of highly energetic He3 and (few) H3 ions could be decelerated in an electric field and the current from that used to generate electricity directly.Here is ECG Herman’s excellent thesis paper on designing and constructing a Farnsworth Fusor:Although they seem like a obvious winners due to their simplicity and effectiveness, ECF reactors have several things limiting scaling:a) There is a limit to the deuterium gas density before performance degrades, so generation capacity is limited.b) Deuterium ions tend to collide with the wire cage cathode in the center, which absorbs them, heating the cage, and causing energy loss and contamination from metal atoms being dislodged.c) As the deuterium ions oscillate back and forth through the center, each time they change direction, they emit bremsstrahlung radiation, or photons of light, losing energy (this is how your dentist’s x-ray machine works).d) Scattering tends to reduce the nice, radial trajectories of the ions into a Maxwellian distribution over time, reducing the fusion that occurs.There has been work in using electromagnets at the periphery to try and hold a ball of electrons in the center, eliminating the need for a central cage… akaThermonuclear WeaponsIn the Teller-Ulam, two-stage, thermonuclear weapon, a spherical plutonium fission primary (with deuterium-tritium fusion fuel at the core to boost it) is imploded by conventional explosives, the plutonium is crushed far beyond critical density, fissions and detonates. The initial radiation released is contained and focused onto the fusion secondary to implode it, ignite fusion, and detonate it. I just mention this to illustrate the enormous energy needed to really reach the Lawson criteria in a large scale, but nuclear weapons kind of freak me out, so I'm going to refer you to the link to the Wikipedia article about them if you want to read more:Thermonuclear weapon - WikipediaSo, in summary, we should not shut down or stop building today's fission nuclear reactors, as commercial fusion reactors are not only far in the future, but also produce radioactive waste (their shielding, which needs to be periodically replaced), and Tokamaks can melt down catastrophically and explode if there is a cooling failure in the magnet coils during full power operation. They also do not run on seawater, like some say. We need expensive and difficult to produce tritium (which is also radioactive) to ignite fusion at the temperatures and densities that today's tokamak magnetic fields can produce.To advance fusion energy in your career, I think the best fields to study would be physics (classical, electrodynamics, plasma, quantum, nuclear…) and computer science, with a focus on numerical simulation. The actual physical fusion reactors are so expensive and time-consuming to build, test, and operate, that you may only get to iterate designs once or twice in a career, but computer simulations can take us in so many different directions more cheaply and easily by comparison.Perhaps there is some exotic stellarator magnetic confinement design, or advanced Farnsworth electrostatic confinement design that has not been explored in depth, that will turn out to hold the key to fusion energy. Simulation is probably the best first step to find it, unless you have a few billion dollars and several hundred kilometers of Niobium-Tin wire and helium cooling tubing to play with.Brent","1,094 followers",Liu Lisong,2K,639,2.9M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Are-the-resources-in-the-Earth-enough-for-all-humans-to-enjoy-the-living-standards-of-developed-countries
28,"Very close and very far at the same time I’m afraid.ITER in France is one of the frontrunnersRight now there are several promising experimental reactors that seem destined to achieve what might be the Holy Grail of energy, a self-sustained fusion reactor where the energy of plasma exceeds the energy used to power all the magnets and other equipment to sustain the reaction.

In theory once you have that, you have your essentially limitless energy source. It’s not actually limitless, but there is enough water in the Solar system to maintain our level of civilization on nothing but fusion power for billions (yes, with a B) of years, well beyond when the Sun runs out of hydrogen.On the other hand all of these projects are very far from being useful. See, producing more energy in plasma than what you put in via magnets is an important milestone, but the one you should be looking at is not the energy of plasma, it’s the energy you can harvest from that plasma. It’s mostly thermal energy and the conversion factor of that to electric power is usually around 1/2. So even these reactors won’t actually be producing more electric power than what they need to power them. They’d have to produce approximately twice that much just to break even.But wait, breaking even still only means you’re running the reactor without external input. You aren’t putting any energy in the grid yet at this point, all you’re doing is producing small quantities of helium. For the reactor to become commercially viable, it needs to produce energy far in excess of that and you need to account for energy needed to generate adequate deuterium and possibly tritium to run the core.That’s why even the furthest advanced fusion reactors are still very far removed from being useful as a power source. It is hoped that once we manage to produce a reactor that will put more energy out than it needed to run it, smaller incremental improvements will follow quickly and the next two steps will not need an exorbiant amount of time. Math seems to suggest we’ll be able to extract several times the energy we put in, that’s why these projects are being financed in the first place.But don’t count on fusion power plant construction starting in mid-2030s either.

Let me tell you how it works with personal experience.A few months ago, I traveled to southern Sichuan for a short trip. I drove into the mountains of the Yungui Plateau.There is a village built on a cliff. Known as the cliff village. Twenty years ago, the villagers had to walk on a mountain path that was nearly 90 degrees in order to gain contact with the outside world.Just like this:But when I arrived, everything has changed. The life that in the eyes of people outside, especially some whites are very traditional and primitive and that ""China's dictatorship should not destroy them"" no longer exists. What I saw is this:Did you see the small village on the right side of the photo? The government moved most of the villagers down and built new houses for them, providing them with the convenience of opening hotels to receive tourists from outside. A museum was built in the local area to commemorate the workers and army that built the railway around the Mao era, which attracted a large number of tourists. Local people no longer have to live in poverty, but make money through the service industry. In this isolated place, there are water pipes, broadband networks and communication base stations, as well as this beautiful road on the water.Also,UHV power lines were set up in the sky to power them.These infrastructures are destined to lose millions of yuan per year.Some villagers remained on the cliff. It became a famous tourist attraction. When you climb the new road to the top of the mountain, you will see the open karst landscape and taste the organic food of the farmhouse. The villagers who stayed in the mountains earned more.The local even provides courier services. Products purchased by locals on Taobao will be delivered within one week.The local canyon is a very valuable tourist resource. If you are here, remember to experience it!Now I formally answer your question: 40 years ago, my government told my parents, please let the people of the east China become rich first, and ask the people of the west China to serve this situation for the time being. Later, the east will give back to the west.Now, the wealthy eastern part of China is bringing a steady stream of capital, technology, industry and thoughts to the west. My government has declared to all Chinese and the world that we must completely defeat poverty. Yes, this is a revolution, becauseI know that some people think that I am a wumao and do propaganda for the Chinese government. it does not matter.––––––Thanks everyone. I have noticed that some questions have been raised about how the local sustained loss infrastructure guarantees sustainability. The answer will start with both national policy and local industry.The Chinese government controls many companies that undertake infrastructure. These companies earn a lot of profits through their monopoly in the country. These profits will be forced to subsidize poor areas in the west to maintain the operation of good local infrastructure.Taking communication base stations as an example, the number of radio base stations deployed in China exceeds the sum of the world (China: about 6 million; other regions and countries: about 5.5 million.).Through the co-ordination of a strong central government, profits earned in wealthy areas are averaged in poor areas. The Chinese do not think this is unreasonable.But more importantly, the local industry needs to develop. Chinese people often say:授人以鱼不如授人以渔,which means to teach a man to fish instead of giving him a fish.Take my hometown as an example. Yunnan, Guizhou and Sichuan have very rich and high-quality tourism resources. As long as they are packaged and promoted, wealthy urban residents are happy to come on holiday.In the cliff village I mentioned, I rented a rubber boat to visit the local river. About 150 yuan. Watch the building on the left side of the photo, it is a resort. At the time, the facility was still under construction. I have had conversations with staff, and their employees are locals who can get a monthly salary of about 400 USD. Plus other local government measures (such as they don't have to pay for their children's education at all), this is enough to make them live a prosperous life.On the other hand, large-scale visitors will also significantly dilute the cost of local infrastructure and other necessities. Take a look at the vehicles in the photo below: These visitors have to park their cars on the side of the road because of the terrain and the restrictions on the parking lot under construction. I hope that this situation has now been improved.Finally, the most important thing is to give hope to the poor.This is another poor area I have traveled to. Guess what this building is used for?The answer is the school.This is the most beautiful campus I have ever seen. It is surrounded by green hills and rivers. The surrounding mountains are reinforced to prevent the destruction of geological disasters. Young people who graduate from college will be paid a high salary and return all tuition fees in cash if they come here for five years as teachers. Local children are admitted to the school for free, and the government provides additional accommodation and nutritious meals(Because it is located in the mountains, the settlements of local people are usually extremely scattered. Concentrating children would help to reduce costs and improve the quality of education).The local resource for attracting tourists is this.I assure you that in the villages and small towns of western China, the most beautiful buildings in the area must be schools and hospitals. For the inconvenient places like Cliff Village, the slow trains that have long been left unattended continue to operate for them to help them connect with the outside world. Cliff Village produces a kind of wild tea, known as Eagle Tea (it is said that the mountain eagle will eat the twig of this tea, hence the name), sold through Taobao.This is what I have seen and heard. I have visited many poor families, and their homes are hanged with portraits of the historical leaders of the PRC. Many Westerners may think that this is the return of authoritarianism, but I don't think so. I think this is human nature.I feel so glorious that I can live in such a country and make a negligible contribution to my country and people.China has more than Beijing, Shanghai or Hangzhou, Chengdu, and the beautiful countryside and forests of the west.We warmly welcome you to visit our country.
