At that time, the peak technology was almost entirely German: they had V2 missiles, they had Wehrner Von Braun and they had tonnes of technical papers seized by the US Army at German missile factories.The trouble was that the German V2 rockets ran on a carbon based fuel, practically kerosene, which was ignited by oxygen transported in the rocket itself. The “energy density” of kerosene was considered to be too low to send a rocket in space, because the rocket had to carry too much of it to obtain the required thrust for the time necessary to reach a sufficient speed to escape the gravity of Earth, and each pound of fuel carried required three more pounds of fuel to take it into orbit. A vicious circle.At that time, also the USSR was working on its own space program, and they had scores of German rockets and technical papers as well. The CIA regularly provided information to JPL about the progress of the Soviet program and at one point, the CIA let the JPL know that the Soviets were experimenting successfully with boron based fuels. So also the JPL started experimenting with these fuels, which promised to be the key to escape the vicious circle of more fuel = more weight = even more fuel, and escape Earth’s gravity as well.Trouble was that boron based fuels were extremely unstable and the rocket motors liked to explode, rather than produce thrust. JPL wasted a lot of time and resources experimenting with boon fuels, but the CIA was positive in telling them that this was the road taken by the Soviets, and so the USA had to beat the same path.Then, on 4 October 1957, the USSR successfully lauched an R-7 rocket which put the Sputnik-1 staellite in orbit. The R-7 motors burned kerosene. Apparently, the whole story of boron based fuels was an elaborate lie that the USSR had deliberately spread to make the CIA believe that they were really experimenting with this kind of fuels, and force the USA to waste time and resources on them.As I said, this story was told to me a long time ago by a professor at the Faculty of Aeronautical engineering of Pisa, and I have no proof that it is true.",0 followers,Israel Walker,1.6K,955,1.1M,2017,https://www.quora.com/Is-it-possible-to-use-boron-as-a-fuel-instead-of-gasoline-or-diesel-technically
1,"tl;dr answer:Jet fuel is 98% kerosene and 2% some additives. The reason for kerosene is that it is the “goldilocks” composition for the things that we expect jets to do: Gasoline starts easier when cold, but boils easily when sitting on a 55 ºC runway or at high altitude. It’s also more likely to burn in an accident. Diesel has more energy per pound, but starts harder and leaves waxy residue, and tends to gel up at very cool temps at high altitude.Long answer:When crude oil is taken out of the ground, it is a chemical soup full of all sorts of carbon hydrogen compounds.

It’s also more likely to burn in an accident. Diesel has more energy per pound, but starts harder and leaves waxy residue, and tends to gel up at very cool temps at high altitude.Long answer:When crude oil is taken out of the ground, it is a chemical soup full of all sorts of carbon hydrogen compounds. The shortest is CH4 (methane) but the longests are solids which are chains where the “links” (carbon-hydrogen bonds) number in the many thousands.Each basic product made from distilled oilMethane carbon count per molecule is 1.Gasoline carbon count is 4 - 12.Kerosene carbon count is 10 - 16.Diesel carbon count is 20 - 28.Waxes, motor oil, road tar, etc. count is 13 - 56.The lighter, smaller carbon chain stuff vaporizes and combines with oxygen very easily. The heavy, longer carbon chain stuff vaporizes only at very high temperatures. (It also tends to hold a lot of solid gunk: Ash and mineral soil, for instance.)There is no theoretical reason you couldn’t make aviation jet engines run on methane, but the tankage would be heavy since it has to be under pressure. There is no theoretical reason you couldn’t make an aviation jet turbine run on asphalt, you’d just to have carry around a lot of extra weight and bulk of preheaters, and change your fuel filtersGenerally the fancier a fuel is, the less variance there is between the high and the low carbon count. Rocket fuel is just kerosene that has been reacted to be much closer to the kerosene ideal of C13. The precision of the specification makes it more predictable and leaves less residue (because of a lower amount of heavy stuff.) Jet fuel is much cleaner and has less variation than standard lamp kerosene, though it it is not nearly so clean and consistent as rocket kerosene.Kerosene has the perfect blend of characteristics: Easy enough to vaporize that it doesn’t need preheat to get started, hard enough to vaporize that it doesn’t boil off under normal operating conditions. It’s heavy enough not to work as a solvent on seals, but light enough not to coke up and leave deposits in the turbine. “Goldilocks” fuel.",23 followers,Andy Hastings,1.2K,842,748.3K,2019,https://www.quora.com/Is-it-possible-to-use-boron-as-a-fuel-instead-of-gasoline-or-diesel-technically

3,"I'll give you a little refinery insight as to why diesel is more expensive than gasoline. But first a little history lesson.Years back, diesel basically was only used as fuel to heat buildings and to run diesel trucks, tractors and stationary engines.

Then came the gas shortages ( I won't get into the cause of this) and the automakers started developing diesel powered autos and light trucks. This put a very small amount of pressure on the availability of diesel but a big incentive to boost prices.Now we get to the refinery element in this. In a crude oil refinery diesel, jet, heating oil and kerosene are all what is called a virgin cut as it is separated out of the crude by heating the crude and distilling it out as a fraction in an atmospheric tower. Then it's cleaned of most of the sulfur and solids/water. The refiners do add a bit of cracked intermediate to help with the. C-tane rating.To produce gasoline, the largest portion is virgin naphtha that is also separated out of the crude in the same tower as the diesel was. To this base they blend in light cracked naphtha that is produced by catalytic conversion of heavy residual oils. They have a few other mysterious ways to produce more gasoline.Diesel is the cheaper fuel to process as it needs very little energy per gallon compared to gasoline. However, they can blend a lot more gasoline than diesel out of a barrel of crude oil.So we're back to supply side pricing. The refineries have to sell a lot of gasoline every day to keep the refinery from running out of storage. Diesel, on the other hand, if price causes a drop in demand they can use it a feed stock to crack more gasoline components.Also federal taxes add a nickel per gallon which is an interesting story in itself.See, it's Easy, Peasy","1,000 followers",Mike Percival,1K,6.6K,8.9M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Is-it-possible-to-use-boron-as-a-fuel-instead-of-gasoline-or-diesel-technically

Not because he needs any recognition but we need inspiration like him to restore our faith in humanity, to believe that humanity is still left, to have a hope of a better India.Ajeet Singh was just 18 when he attended a wedding in his home town near Varanasi in 1988. It was here that he saw a“The way people were looking at her and treating her was something that shocked and deeply saddened me. It was then and there that I decided to do something to free girls like her from such a profession,” recalls Ajeet.This was not just a passing thought that Ajeet had that day. When the girl finished her performance, Ajeet went up to her and asked if he could take care of her children and give them an opportunity to study and lead a better life.Ajeet Singh was still in his teens when he realized what he wanted to do.It wasn’t easy for an 18-year-old boy who was still in his first year of college to take on such a big responsibility. But Ajeet didn’t think twice and actually adopted the three children of the girl.“Of course my decision was not welcomed by my family or society. I faced huge opposition from everyone. But this is what I wanted to do,” he says.He then went ahead and started teaching the children in his spare time and helped them come up with life goals that would take them far away from the dark streets on which their mother lived.In addition, he started going to the red light areas of Varanasi to teach the children of the women who worked there. But he soon realised that the problem was much more complex than he had thought.Ajeet provides educational opportunities to the children of women who work in the red light area of Varanasi.“The whole profession and system are so complex that providing mere education to the kids or spreading awareness about health, HIV, etc cannot solve it. The issue is slavery and the need to abolish the system of sex trafficking. It is only then that girls can be saved to lead better lives,” he says.It was time to take a more aggressive approach, Ajeet thought. And this is when he started an organization called Guria in 1993 to fight against the sexual exploitation of girls, especially minors. What these girls needed was freedom and he was here to help them.Ajeet prepared himself to take on the racket. He got a few hidden cameras—in his pen, shirt button, watch, etc — and started to pose as a customer, only to track the locations of red light areas and the number of minor girls there.Once he had done the mapping, he collected a large number of volunteers and raided the Shivdaspur red light area of Varanasi. They managed to rescue 15 girls in one day.Since then he has conducted raids on all the red light areas of Varanasi and rescued over 1,000 girls so far.Ajeet organizes many campaigns and rallies to spread awareness about the issue of human trafficking.Once the girls are rescued, they are sent to government shelters and homes and, after counselling, sent back to their parents. A close track is kept of their activities to make sure they do not end up back in the same situation again.“Today, I can say Varanasi is almost free from child prostitution,” claims Ajeet.After he started rescuing the girls, Ajeet decided the next step was to take on the pimps and brothel keepers who played a key role in the prostitution racket. “Even the police did not do anything and we thought it was time to bring this issue out in the open,” he says.So, apart from rescuing girls, Ajeet started taking legal action against the sex traffickers. Through his organization, Guria, he has filed about 1,400 cases against traffickers and has even landed many of them in jail.Guria’s work does not end with just filing cases against the traffickers. The organization also tries to ensure that those who have been convicted do not get bail. The team works intensively towards the bail rejection of such convicts—over 400 such bail requests have been rejected due to Guria’s intervention.“Often, these traffickers who get bail come out quickly and start doing what they did earlier. We make sure they stay in jail for a long time. Some of them have been in jail for about four to five years now,” says Ajeet.Another area of focus is to get the rescued girls to the court for trials. They are provided witness protection, helped with mock trials, provided counselling, and encouraged to speak up about the wrong that has been done to them. Over 108 girls are currently being protected and hidden at various locations to get them ready for trial.Guria also helps in rehabilitating the rescued girls and teaching them various skills so they can switch to other professions.Guria is working to prevent trafficking, especially of minor girls.Educational workshops and awareness campaigns are among the other initiatives of Guria.“Our idea is not just to provide one-time support. These girls are like our children. You cannot just provide clothing or just food to your children. You have to give them overall support. This is what we do for these girls,” says Ajeet.Thanks to Ajeet, thousands of girls lead a better life today. Ishita (name changed), a 17-year-old minor girl was kidnapped from near her house in Varanasi in 2009. She was taken to New Delhi by the traffickers and was raped repeatedly by numerous men inside a locked room. She was then taken to Surat and was gang raped for several days. Ishita’s horror did not end here. She was then taken to Mumbai where traffickers planned to sell her to a third party. This is when the Guria team intervened and rescued the girl from the claws of the traffickers. They did not just bring Ishita back to her family but also got the lead trafficker arrested and made sure his bail was rejected. The case is under trial in district court.What may appear to be a simple success story wasn’t easy to implement at all. Ajeet had to face challenges from all sides—from family members who went against him for choosing to work in this field to brothel keepers who would go to extreme lengths to make sure Ajeet did not succeed in his mission.“I have been attacked so many times and given death threats. Even my family did not support me. A lot of people raised question about my work but I was determined to save the lives of these girls”, says Ajeet.Ajeet wants to make sure that no girl is forced to enter the dark profession of sex trade.Also, the network of brothels is so complex that many girls always speak in favour of the brothel keepers.“They are brought up in that environment, they are scared and never speak against them. When it comes to minors, we do not listen to them and sometimes have to pull these girls out of the brothels,” he says.With a team of 25 members and hundreds of volunteers, Ajeet continues his mission to eliminate this profession entirely from the streets of Varanasi. He gets support from CRY and individual donations, which help him conduct rescue operation and organise various workshops.In the future, Ajeet wants to continue with his mission to make sure no girl is forced into this dark profession.At 18, He Adopted a Prostitute's Kids.

She would often read her brother’s books and took training from her teachers to solve the problems quickly.Her brilliance does not just shine in India.

Next on the list isThis man carries seeds and saplings in his pocket and travels long disrances to spot a piece of barren land where he can plant them. He even sold his three acre plot of land to gather necessary funds for purchasing seeds and saplings. He carries a scarf which says “Vriksho Rakshati Rakshitaha” whenever he sets out to plant saplings. He has been awarded a lot of state and national awards on account of his contribution towards conservation of the environment. The Padma Shri awardee has no plans to stop as he aspires to inspire at least a crore people so that each of them plants a tree.3.This National Security Guard (NSG) commando was just 31 years old when he laid down his life fighting the Pakistani terrorists in Mumbai in November 2008. On the eventful night of November 27, he was assigned the duty to clear the Hotel Taj of terrorists. He and his team engaged the militants in a fierce gunfight. Not only did he save the common men, but he also arranged for the evacuation of one of his fellow commandos who got hit in the exchange of fire. When the terrorists escaped to another floor of the hotel, he took matters into his own hands and asked his team not to follow him. What followed was another fierce round of gunfight and the Major was hit by their bullets. In a last ditch effort he tried to save his soldier Gajendra Singh, but eventually succumbed to his injuries.4.Born to British parents in Kolkata, he was the first Indian and Asian to win an Olympic medal. He won two silver medals in the Paris Olympics,1900 in two different categories- 200 meter hurdles and 200 meter sprint. Although it is reported by Olympic historians that Pritchard was chosen to represent Great Britain, the IOC still regard him as having competed for India and his two medals are credited to India. After his success in the Olympics, he decided to pursue a career in acting and went to the United States. Consequently, he became the first Olympian to act in a silent Hollywood film under the screen name, Norman Trevor.5.A former national level volleyball and football player with dreams of joining the paramilitary forces met with a terrible accident when she was thrown off a moving train for resisting robbers somewhere between Lucknow and Delhi in April, 2011.

Sen left India in the year 1910 leaving his elder brother and his widowed mother. He then registered himself in the famous University of Leeds and pursued BSc in Electrical Engineering and graduated in 1913. After his graduation he started working as an assistant engineer at Leeds Corporation Electric Lighting station.As the war broke out the recruitment of the volunteer soldier began. He was among the first to enroll himself in the 1st Battalion of Leeds which was also called the “Leeds Pals” unofficially. Private Sen ended up in Number 16 Platoon (D Company) of the 15th (Service) Battalion (1st Leeds) Prince of Wales’s Own (West Yorkshire Regiment) – often abbreviated to the 15th West Yorkshire Regiment or 1st Leeds Pals. He was highly qualified to become an officer, but back in those days racism was at its peak. Since he was a dark skinned Indian, he was not offered an officer’s position instead he joined as a Private.(Picture: Sen with a cigarette in extreme right of the picture)The battalion had been formed in September 1914 by mayor Edward Brotherton. Some 20,000 people gathered to wave off the first recruits from Leeds on September 25.After training in Colsterdale, North Yorkshire, and on Salisbury Plain, the battalion was sent to Egypt in December 1915, before moving to France in the following March. By May, Private Sen and his comrades were at the front at Bus-Les-Artois in the Somme department. He was killed in action as part of a wiring party that was heavily bombarded late on the night of 22 May, after being hit by shrapnel in the leg and neck. Private Sen was buried in Sucrerie Military CemetryAccording to his obituary in The Times in September 1916, his commanding officer wrote of him:His personal belongings were sent back to his hometown Chandannagar to his brother Dr. Jotindra Nath Sen and those belongings are still kept in a secured glass box in museum at Chandannagar.(Photo: His belongings at Chandannagar museum)A comrade, Arthur Dalby, told historian Laurie Milner in 1988:That’s the story of a unique Bengali man who fought the World War 1 not representing British Indian Army but from being a integral part of the British Army.Incidentally, Jogendranath Sen isThank you!I share more answers, questions and posts like these on my space:",278 followers,Sadhana Reddy,6.9K,0,0,2020,https://www.quora.com/Who-are-some-great-Indians-that-most-people-have-not-heard-of

Since the ambulance could not reach them, Karimul tied the patient to his back, made him ride pillion and took him to Jalpaiguri Sadar Hospital. The co-worker received medical attention and regained his health.

Requests for an ambulance are rarely heard in this area and the nearest hospital today is 45 kilometres away.Not only his bike ambulance service but Karimul also provides basic and first aid treatment to the villagers after learning from the local doctors.

He started National Voters Awareness Campaign to make them aware of their rights and duties as a citizen. Seshan also called for the Government to issue photo identity card to all voters. Again, Government didn’t co-operate, so he declared that no election would be held in the country if ID cards were not issued to the voters. Few elections were postponed because ID cards were not ready, but Supreme Court ruled that voting is the inherent right of voters, and voting cannot be postponed for the lack of ID cards.Seshan also created a group of Election Inspection Observers, which were recruited from Tax department. They were assigned the duty of checking the expenses by the candidates in every constituency on a day-to-day basis. One of Seshan’s controversial policies was the ban on the graffiti as well as loudspeakers, posters on public and private property.

He looks after the needy. He visits old age homes once in a while.

This brought him opposition from the British India Steam Navigation Company (BISNC) which held a monopoly in shipping services in the Indian ocean.The indigenous ship building of India had been dead since 19th century due to British regulation to protect interests of British companies and workers. Alongside the ship building monopoly enjoyed by the British, the shipping services were also firmly in their hands.In 1906, VOC launched his shipping company and christened it Swadeshi Steam Navigation Company, after the swadeshi movement. Throughout its short existence, VOC would face opposition from the vested business interests afraid of competition and from the imperial government due to his nationalist credentials.Since the nascent company did not own ships of its own, it leased a ship, but the lessor was pressurized by the BISNC to cancel the lease. Undeterred, VOC proclaimed: “Share certificate of Swadeshi Steam Navigation CompanyEventually, VOC purchased his first ship, but the much larger British monopoly resorted to predatory pricing to run his shipping company into the ground (pun intended).

In retaliation, he was sentenced to 40 years in prison, though the length of the sentence was reduced after appeal in a higher court.While he was in prison, his company came under increased strain because of the dissipating national sentiment as the swadeshi movement lost steam. Moreover, the predatory pricing of the British India Steam Navigation Company could not be fought against for too long. In 1911, his shipping company was liquidated when he was still in jail.Following his release in 1912, VOC continued to face hardships till his death. Though his law license had been restored (it had been revoked following his arrest), his practise was more or less over. He started aAfter independence, to honour VOC, the first ship of a new shipping company was named after him (flagged off by Rajaji himself). The port of Tuticorin itself, where his company started from, was named V.O. Chidambaranar Port Trust. Stamps in his name were issued in 1972.Still, to this day, V.O.

He was so dedicated towards his work that when, during one of the recording sessions, his father passed away, but he still did not leave the recording room until the recordings were finalized. Apart from composing various ‘super-hit’ songs for Hindi movies, he had also launched several private albums which were praised by many.3.

He has just one leg which is so strong that he not only plays the game effortlessly but also easily covers the entire court. Ever since he was a kid, he would indulge in outdoor activities with other kids without letting his disability come in the way. Aren’t we super proud of this talented man?4.

By that time India had a foreign information-gathering wing in Intelligence Bureau (IB) but it wasn't successful at all in gathering Intel.So by 1968, Indira Gandhi decided to bifurcate IB into two: one specifically designed to gather Intel on foreign lands and relation. Kao, then a deputy director in the Intelligence Bureau, was appointed by the prime minister Indira Gandhi the first head of the RAW. In fact, Kao was appointed the role after handling out a blueprint to then Government stating the principle of the agency with a mere 250But this never weighed him down, as he himself would pick all the operatives to run the organization efficiently. Such was his aura, that agents working under him were known asRAW's biggest victory came in 1971 with independence of Bangladesh. Kao and his team effectively sized up the emerging scenario in what is now Bangladesh with precision. They didn't wanted to take head-on war with Pakistan, they simply wanted Pakistan to bleed to death. So that they were reluctant to bifurcate Pakistan.In fact, India had so much intelligence that they were able to pin-point the exact location of the room where crucial conversation was taking place. Indian army could simply blow the place off. The Indian Naval Commandos were able to blow up every single Pakistani ship including Gazi, the nuclear submarine, Pakistan had acquired from US.They even managed to find out about how Pakistan was developing Nuclear weapons with a exact blueprint of the design and the exact precise location.That was the power ofAfter 3 years, he was successful at annexing Sikkim into India. As it was time of Cold War, India being a firm supporter of Soviet and Pakistan taking sides with US, US encouraged Pakistan to contact China to help them take over the state of Sikkim. Like they did with the Tibet. Because if Americans or Chinese got any hold over the region, the security of India could be compromised.Alexandre de Marenches, erstwhile head of the French external intelligence agency, or SDECE, counted Kao among the top five intelligence chiefs in the world of the 70s.In fact, Chairman of Joint Intelligence Committee, K N Daruwala said:“His contacts the world over, particularly in Asia—Afghanistan, Iran, China, you name it—were something else. He could move things with just one phone call. He was a team leader who rode out notorious inter-departmental and inter-service rivalries, which is commonplace in India.”Such was his clout in the sub-continent and Asia in particular.He then went on to create NSG (National Security Guards), which now comes under one of the finest breed of soldiers in the world. In fact, it was NSG who helped Taj Hotel get rid of the terrorists during the 26/11 attacks.Even after his retirement, he was rarely seen. In fact, after the retirement, he was photographed only",49 followers,Tushar Sharma,2.1K,75,1M,2017,https://www.quora.com/Who-are-some-great-Indians-that-most-people-have-not-heard-of

After doing back-breaking work from dawn to dusk through her childhood, she was married off to Bekal Chikkayya, a cattle herder. The couple were unable to conceive even after 25 years of their marriage, and decided to plant trees and raise them instead.Banyan trees were aplenty near Thimmakka’s village. Thimakka and her husband started grafting saplings from these trees. Ten saplings were grafted in the first year and they were planted along a distance of 4 kilometers near the neighbouring village of Kudoor. Fifteen saplings were planted in the second year and 20 in the third year. She used her own meager resources for planting these trees. The couple used to carry four pails of water for a distance of four kilometers to water the saplings. They were also protected from grazing cattle by fencing them with thorny shrubs.Her husband Chikkayya passed away in 1991. His memories, however, continue to grow and flourish. The saplings they planted together over 50 years ago, majestically line the five-km stretch from Kudur to Hulikal, under the shade of which Thimmakka relaxes and muses.

She and her team spotted three scared young girls in school uniforms getting down from the Chennai Express on Platform 15. When she went up to the girls to ask them if they were in trouble, they only stared at her. That’s when she realised they couldn’t understand her. Putting two and two together, the team called a Tamil-speaking person to help. It turned out that the girls had been kidnapped outside their school in Chennai; they had been tricked into approaching a van, the forced into it. At a traffic signal, one of the girls bit her captor, and in the resulting confusion, they managed to escape. In panic, they boarded a train at a nearby station, not knowing it was a long-distance express. “We then called up their parents, and the local police station, Ms. Mishra says. “The girls were my responsibility, I felt, so slept along with them at the police station.”Ms. Mishra, who is 32 and joined the RPF in 2014, is known a hard-working officer with a track record of helping children at the CST station. She has rescued 434 children, 45 of them girls. Most of them were kids who had run away from home, often because of being beaten by parents. There are also frequent cases of children who, obsessed with a film star or attracted by rumours of glamour in Mumbai, had run away to see it for themselves. There are some where they came to meet Facebook friends, and there have been victims of kidnapping too.“As per my records,” Ms. Mishra says, “Most of them are from U.P. and Bihar.” Almost all the children found are from 13 to 16 years old. Sometimes, though, the children are too young and unfamiliar with the world outside their homes, so it is difficult to even get their addresses and names of their family members from them. There was one case of a boy who couldn’t speak or hear, and the RPF had to call in experts in sign language to understand him. Sadly, out of the 434 rescued children she has handled, the RPF was only able to trace the parents of 28; the rest had to be handed over to the Child Welfare Committee for further action.Ms. Mishra works in a team with ASI Shivram Singh and other staff. They are trained to follow proper procedure, with a lengthy process — designed to protect the best interests of the child — to be followed every time a child is rescued. Santoshi Dhekle, team member of Community Committed Development Trust, says, “After medical tests, and following procedures like making entries with and filling up documents at station manager’s office, we take the child for further investigation. We try to find out their parents so we can send the kids home. Or we have to send them to the remand home in Mankhurd or Dongri.”In 2017, as of the end of March, Ms. Mishra and her colleagues had already rescued 162 children. They expect the number of such cases to rise in June. Ms. Mishra says that this is because children have school holidays, and therefore more team to roam around, and sometimes they take advantage of the freedom, or are tempted by the stories they have heard of Mumbai, so they get into trains without knowing anything about the city or knowing anyone there.Ms. Mishra’s work has impressed senior officers. Ajay Yadav, the senior inspector in charge of CST, says, “She is a very hard-working and dedicated staff member, ther staff should also learn a lesson from her hard work.”Sachin Bhalode, Senior Divisional Security Commissioner, CR, RPF, said, “This is different type of work, and one has to be very dedicated and needs a special skill which, Ms. Mishra has. This is a very responsible job, handling sensitive cases.

""Globally, 40 percent food produced is wasted in some form or the other.""""If, in India, we can try and manage excess food, we can reduce hunger to a considerable level.""Feeding India has facilitated one million meals in the last two years and aims to continue his quest towards his bigger and ambitious goal.I want to make India hunger free by 2030,"" he says.Ankit lives in Delhi with his parents -- his father is a businessman and mother, a homemaker. His younger sister works at Ernst and Young.Story of Sh. AnkitIn 2014, I was attending a wedding. There were about 1,000 guests and 35 different items on the menu.When I had a chat with the caterer, he told me the food could easily feed about 5,000 people, but after the guests leave, all this food would be dumped.I was shocked to find that so much food would be wasted that day. And similarly, at several other weddings, family events, festivals and social gatherings.Through various incidents in my life, I had experienced how several kids and people in the slums sleep hungry because they cannot afford to buy food.I wanted to bridge these two situations, but I did not know how and where to start.It struck me that if I were to find a way to use the excess food to feed the hungry, it would be so much useful. That's how the idea was born.the first timeMy friend Akash and I were attending a wedding in Noida. I spoke to the caterer and at 2 am, when the wedding got over, he told me that the excess food could be consumed by about 500 people.I had no plan, but I wanted to test my idea that day. I asked my friend to join me and convinced the caterer to provide me with spare containers to carry the unused food. So, at 2 am, we put everything in the car and set out to locate people whom we could feed.Given the odd hour, it felt stupid and at the time, I felt excited to do it. We found a shelter home that had only 100 people.There was so much food that my friend was sitting in the front seat of the car with a container on his lap.On our way, we were stopped by cops who weren't quite convinced why we were carrying so much food at the late hour.They suspected something foul, so we had to convince them really hard. After a lot of driving around and making a dozen phone calls, we found a place where we could donate all the food.Quiting jobIt wasn't a planned move at all. I was just too overpowered by the thought of finding a solution to manage food wastage.One night I switched off the lights in my room and started talking to myself about this problem.I did not want to be complaining any more, I wanted to find a solution.The next day, I wrote a letter to my manager in the US office mentioning that I'd like to resign. He thought I had found something better, so he didn't question much.I did not inform my parents too. I was on notice for two months. I used this time to research food quality and food waste.I spoke to several NGOs and caterers who could help me.When I started sharing my ideas on social media, my friends thought I was going to become a politician or social worker. They did not take me seriously.Challenges facedMy first challenge was to convince the caterers to give me the excess food. They wanted to know what I would do with it.It was absurd how some of them wanted me to charge me per plate for food that would have otherwise gone into the garbage can.I told them I wasn't benefitting from the activity. I was just feeding the hungry.With restaurants, it was a different story.Most of them did not want to be associated with trading excess food. They'd rather dump it away than get into trouble.What if the food contaminates when taken outside? The brand wouldn't want to take responsibility for it.We understood their concerns and worked out a deal where the restaurant authorities would not be responsible for the food once it leaves their premises.make any moneyLaughsWe started off as a not-for-profit organisation which explains I am working with volunteers who are committed to the cause and are sharing their feedback.Right now, I cannot afford to pay people, so I am hiring them for a period of six months like an internship set-up where they explore different aspects of Feeding India.Simultaneously, I am working on a sustainable funding model.raised any money yet?When I started off, I was against donations. But now, I have opened up to the idea. I am looking at partnerships and crowdfunding so I can expand the idea to more cities.In December, we raised Rs 10 lakhs (This truck costing Rs 11.5 lakhs (Instead, with the money, we rented a van which is operating in Gurgaon. This Magic Van has a refrigerator which stocks up food collected from corporate organisations and feeds people from the slums.Some pics of UN summitEventually, I am planning to partnering with organisations and young leaders to facilitate education as part of the activity.It's a three-fold goal -- Zero Poverty.

At a young age, povertyHarekala HajabbaMan who built school by selling orangesHajabba born in Harekala, around 25 km from Mangaluru City.Due to his very poor family background, growing up Hajabba wanted to roll beedis in the city for livelihood but fate ended up him in selling oranges.Every morning, Harekala Hajabba sets out with his basket laden with oranges and makes the 25-km trip to Mangaluru. For thirty years, this has been his livelihood and in the last 15, every anna that he earns goes toward building schools and giving the poorest of the poor an education.“I have never been to school. At a young age, poverty pushed me into taking up a job selling oranges. One day, I encountered two foreigners who wanted to buy a few oranges from me. They started speaking to me in English and asked about the price of the oranges. But I was unable to converse with them and they left. I felt humiliated after this incident and was ashamed that the language barrier made them walk away,” he says.Not wanting anyone else to go through what he had experienced, his life’s mission suddenly became clear to him. From that day onwards, Hajabba worked towards setting up a school so that the poor children in his village had access to education.His wife Maimoona would often complain, saying he was giving away money meant for their own three children. Later, she too realised the importance of his cause.Hajabba’s dream slowly took shape in 1999, in the form of a school attached to a madrasa in his village. When it started, there were only 28 students. However, as the number of students grew, Hajabba knew he would have to shift the school to a bigger facility. So he continued to accumulate every rupee he earned towards building a proper school and ensuring the education of future generations.In 2004, Hajabba bought 50 cents of land. However, he realised that his savings would not be enough to build a school. So Hajabba started approaching people for money. From politicians to organisations to rich individuals, he went knocking on every door.“I once went to a very rich person’s house to seek funds for the school. But what happened was that instead of giving me money he set his dogs on me,” Hajabba says.The unwillingness of some people to support him didn’t come in the way of his dream.Slowly, Hajabba gathered enough money and constructed a small primary school on the land.Around this time, the media began to take notice of him too. Hosa Digantha, a Kannada newspaper, was the first to run a story on Hajabba. Soon after that, CNN IBN nominated him for its ‘Real Heroes’ award. Hajabba used his cash prize of Rs. 5 lakh towards building the school.This was just the beginning.Soon, recognition began pouring in from every corner. And with the recognition came the donations. Today, the school stands proudly on 1.5 acres of land in the village and has as many as 150 children studying there. From being a primary school, it has now become a secondary school.“My duty was to only construct the school. I gave it to the government and now the government runs it. It is not only a school for Muslims. Poor children from every religion study in the school,” he says.Hajabba has truly earned the respect of the people in his village and around the country. Many say they look up to him because the recognition and awards haven’t gone to his head. Nor have they deterred him from his real purpose — he remains humble to date. When the school was constructed, there was a proposal to name it after him. But Hajabba declined, saying he didn’t want to be in the limelight.Hajabba is often invited to speak at various events. Universities in the region encourage him to share his story in an attempt to inspire students. In 2014, the United Christian Association decided to invite Hajabba to speak at a Christmas programme. To invite Hajabba for the event, Alban Menezes, the founder of the organisation, tried calling him multiple times.“Finally, his son picked the phone and told me that he was admitted to Yenepoya Hospital in the city and was in critical condition. I rushed to the hospital and this is when the doctors told me there was something troubling Hajabba that was making his health worse,” says Alban.After a lot of coaxing, Hajabba broke down in front of Alban. He told him that he was worried about not having a proper roof over his head. Hajabba, who had spent all his money for the cause of education, didn’t have any left to repair his dilapidated house.Alban was deeply saddened by this and decided to construct a house for the man who had done so much for society.In September 2015, Alban started constructing a house for Hajabba and it was completed in a record four months at a cost of Rs. 15 lakh.Photo Credit: H.S. ManjunathWhile his organisation was able to raise Rs. 1.5 lakh, Alban chipped in the rest of the money from his own resources.“I am truly overwhelmed. I am an ordinary man you see. I’m not even worth 15 rupees and these people have actually built a house for me. I have no words to express my gratitude,” says Hajabba.This 760 sq. ft. house has two bedrooms, a kitchen, and a special enclosure for all of Hajabba’s awards and trophies.Photo source:The housewarming ceremony was a special one. This communally-sensitive region witnessed a Hindu priest, a Muslim mullah and a Catholic priest conducting prayers at the ceremony. MP Nalin Kumar Kateel and Karnataka’s Minister for Health and Family Welfare, U.T. Khader, also attended the event.“The district authorities have been very helpful. I’ve never had a gas stove in my house. The District Commissioner ensured I got a gas connection and a stove. This was sanctioned from some special fund. I feel I’ve been truly blessed,” says Hajabba.This, however, is not the end of Hajabba’s story. He now plans to construct a Government Pre-University College in his village and has already started working towards the goal. And if his past is any indication, Hajabba will not rest till this dream is fulfilled too.He has built a high school in Newpadupu, his native village and soon he plans to upgrade the school to pre University College for the poor children around his village.His relentless toward the betterment of children, which he does by giving them an education, has him many laurels. His life story is now a lesson in the syllabus of Mangalore University MA course.He is an inspiration to all of us; he has done selfless service to the society and never ran behind any fame, name and money.I wish him all the success in his future endeavor, Hope his dream to build PU College come true soonArticle Source:",29 followers,Aditya Jain,763,0,0,2015,https://www.quora.com/Who-are-some-great-Indians-that-most-people-have-not-heard-of

He was declared dead at Holy Spirit Hospital in Andheri.After losing his son, 46-year old Dadarao, a vegetable vendor, decided he would repair as potholes to ensure they don’t claim another life. “My son died because the government authorities could not be bothered to repair the pothole. The BMC only fills potholes after people die. I have decided to chip in and prevent people from dying,” he said.Dadarao repairs potholes in areas such as Andheri East, Goregaon East, Mankhurd and Ghatkopar. “I travel from Marol to the Vashi APMC market every day to buy vegetables. I keep track of the potholes along the way,” he said.For his work, Dadarao uses extra material, including paver blocks and sand, left behind by contractors and civic authorities. “I take the measurement of the pothole and pack it with paver blocks and sand. But the repair often doesn’t hold and the material washes away,” he said.On the day Prakash died, his 24-year-old cousin, Ram Bilhore, was riding the motorbike. He believes he was saved only because he was wearing a helmet. “My brother was not as lucky. That day, even though I was riding very slowly, there was no way I could have seen that submerged pothole. The one lesson I learnt from the experience was to always wear a helmet. I now encourage all my friends to wear one even if they are riding pillion,” he said.Dadarao says he will keep up his mission against potholes till the day government authorities discharge their responsibilities. “For people who ride motorbikes, it is scary to be out on the roads in the monsoon. Any submerged pothole can lead to terrible injuries, or worse, death,” he said.Dadarao and his family members have also launched a mobile application called Spothole, which they use to track and repair potholes the BMC fails to fill.Apart from conducting a rally, the Watchdog Foundation has written to Chief Minister“We have written to the CM and the civic chief, asking for potholes on Andheri-Kurla road to be repaired and the illegal parking be stopped. The potholes have become a grave concern, they are putting lives at risk. The government should stop wasting tax payers’ money and make roads in the city safe again,” said Godfrey Pimenta of Watchdog Foundation.Dadarao Bilhore’s no physicist, or mathematician or any scientist but just a common man who is trying to make a difference so that no other person undergoes the tragedy of losing a child.India needs more people like him!.A pothole killed his son last year, man repairs 360 death traps in Mumbai since then",14 followers,Shamanth Gowda,816,0,0,2017,https://www.quora.com/Who-are-some-great-Indians-that-most-people-have-not-heard-of

Because, again, he was not only the foremost linguist, but also the foremost mathematical linguist. So what? Well, Pāṇini’s rules for framing mathematical problems in simple phrases have been pivotal in the framing of a language called ALGOL 60, the 1960s precursor to modern day programming languages like Pascal and and the C family!!When Pāṇini’s work became known in Europe in the 19th century, many American and British linguists drew heavily from his ideas on structuralism, by which a language can be reproduced in a definitive form every single time an iteration of an operation is required. All the greats like Franz Bopp, Leonard Broomfeld and others extensively discussed and debated his rules for structural frameworks on languages. Along the way came a young man, Noam Chomsky, today regarded as one of the foremost intellectuals in the world, who also came under Pāṇini’s spell. So did another named Alan Turing.One thing led to another, and soon enough a new comprehensive computing language was born: the ALGOL 60, characterized as procedural, imperative and structured, which has been the predecessor of all “ALGOL like languages” which include Pascal, Ada, the C language family and so on. Yes, C, C+, C++ and et al!! There is even talk of renaming the Backus – Naur form, the original definition of a programmable language as defined by Pāṇini, using reiterative constraints on strings, as the Pāṇini – Backus form as it rightfully should be known!!Note: I didn't have the right words to describe his genius.Source:",98 followers,Sagar Bhandary,662,59,266.1K,2017,https://www.quora.com/Who-are-some-great-Indians-that-most-people-have-not-heard-of

And, his self-belief rubbed on to his men.‘Sam’ Maneskhaw backed his men through and through. And, his self-belief rubbed on to his men.He would back officers even if some of them developed a fondness for the bottle that made them anathema in the eyes of some of his more punctilious colleagues. ‘Sam’ felt that the indiscretions of youth could be overlooked if the officer was courageous and a brilliant tactician, one whom soldiers would follow unquestioningly.Thus, when the 1971 war came about, the General had around him officers who were not afraid to speak out their mind but when ordered to do so, would fulfil their missions with the dedication of evangelists. Like Major General Ian Cordozo who cut off his leg without anaesthesia after gangrene had set in during the battle at Sylhet in Bangladesh. Manekshaw conveyed to his Eastern Command chief Lt. Gen. J.F.R. Jacob, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi’s wish to move quickly into East Pakistan in 1971. On being asked by General Jacob to wait till the end of monsoons, ‘Sam’ accepted his commander’s advice and did not budge when requested by the political leadership to launch operations immediately.Asked by Indira Gandhi whether “Manekshaw was proved right. By the time war was declared, the army had over eight lakh men, about 300 fighter planes, 1,500 tanks and 3,000 artillery pieces. The Pakistan Army had less than half that number of men, fighter jets, tanks and artillery pieces.Apart from being a wonderful soldier, he was a superb orator and inspiring person.Manekshaw was at his evocative best when he recalled his acquaintance with President Yahya Khan when the latter had worked under him in the military operations directorate of the British Indian Army just before partition.Yahya Khan, then a colonel, was impressed by Manekshaw's James motorcycle which he had bought for Rs 1400. ''''A quintessential soldier, he once told the cadets at the Indian Military Academy, ""You will not have wealth, you will not be rich but you will have respect, you will be the soldier of this great Army.""Field Marshal Manekshaw travelled the world, led the Indian Army, witnessed and participated in five different wars but in the end he settled down in serene town of Coonoor, in the Nilgiri Hills, and built a house with his wife Seelu. It is here that he spent the last three decades of his life.His personal staff, notably Manbahadur and his family, adored Sam. Manbhadur, who served in the Army for 15 years before coming to live with the Field Marshal, became family.But Sam's larger-than-life image also earned him some enemies. For long, he was denied the benefits and status due to a Field Marshal. It was not until 2006-07 that President Abdul Kalam took the initiative and made sure the general got his full dues. But perhaps, it was too late by then. Sam was already in hospital. His wife's loss had left him weaker.Shockingly, Sam Manekshaw was treated shabbily in his death too. Defence Minister AK Antony did not go for his funeral and neither did any of the military chiefs.Family members, however, have kept a dignified silence.

He did win the Arjuna award for breaking Sen's record. But Olympic gold? That remained just a dream for the young man. It was not because he lost form and failed to win medals, but for lack of sponsors!In a country that appreciates only cricketers, even if they are mediocre, the talented Kutral was sidelined and forgotten.When he went to swim in Italy in 1994 he was offered all training facilities provided he represented Italy at the Atlanta Olympics. Kutral declined the offer because he was an Indian and wanted to represent his own country. Alas, that never happened.Though he started off by swimming in pools, it was the sea that attracted him, offered him challenges. He then met Jayalalitha, who was Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, and told her about his dream of swimming the English Channel. She promised to sponsor him, and also urged him to attempt the Palk Straits. The English Channel thus became his first cross-country swim, sponsored by the Tamil Nadu government.“But how long could I go and request the Chief Minister to sponsor Kutral? Almost all the long distance swimming took place in Europe, and it was very expensive; I couldn't manage that much money,"" said Kutral's father Ramesh.Even as a 16-year-old, Kutral was sad about the way his father had to run around each time a competition came up. He had said then, 'I was to participate in a competition in Germany. Everything from tickets to visa were ready. We were to start at 5.30 in the evening. At 3 pm we got a call from the sponsors. They said they could not sponsor me. My brother had gone to Bombay to arrange for the visa. At the last moment we had to cancel everything. I cannot say how disappointed I was.'“Since I am in India I have to concentrate more on my studies now. I am in the tenth standard and I have to cut down on my tours. In other countries, if you excel in some sports you are eligible for good jobs. But here, unless you have a good academic background, you will not get any job. So, I am forced to give more importance to studies than swimming. Given a chance I would like to channelise all my energy into swimming.” he said.He couldn't, and decided to concentrate on studies. Reason: ""Lack of sponsorship.” When he realised that every competition abroad was a burden on his parents, he decided to call it quits.“At one point I would like to open a swimming academy in India.""Source : RediffKannan Kalidas",327 followers,Nikhil Reddy,543,59,389.4K,2017,https://www.quora.com/Who-are-some-great-Indians-that-most-people-have-not-heard-of

In India, this idea was debated for 20 years and became a victim of departmentalism in Indian Railways. But the more it is delayed, the more India will be left behind. I was determined to implement it and I realized that ICF was the right place to manufacture it as the staff and officers have the talent and enthusiasm and so went ahead with it”said Mr.Mani in an interview.What makes this Train 18 a glorious project is that it has been manufactured almost without importing much technology and only about 20 Percent of the components were imported and rest all are made in India and it is also noted that in last two years ICF increased its productions by 1000 coaches a year which is 33 percent growth.The man didn't limit himself and went to develop the entire Infrastructure of the ICF and the colonies nearby. The untidy industrial area is been transformed from thisto this.And apart from beautifying the the industrial zone with such art works there were several steps taken towards enhancing the environment nearby.

Nada??I bet you might have seen his creation atleast.Yes! He is Amar Bose.Amar G. Bose, the visionary engineer, inventor and billionaire entrepreneur whose namesake company, the Bose Corporation, became synonymous with high-quality audio systems and speakers for home users, auditoriums and automobiles.As founder and chairman of the privately held company, Dr. Bose focused relentlessly on acoustic engineering innovation. His speakers, though expensive, earned a reputation for bringing concert-hall-quality audio into the home.And by refusing to offer stock to the public, Dr. Bose was able to pursue risky long-term research, such as noise-canceling headphones and an innovative suspension system for cars, without the pressures of quarterly earnings announcements.In a 2004 interview in Popular Science magazine, he said: “I would have been fired a hundred times at a company run by M.B.A.’s. But I never went into business to make money. I went into business so that I could do interesting things that hadn’t been done before.”A perfectionist and a devotee of classical music, Dr. Bose was disappointed by the inferior sound of a high-priced stereo system he purchased when he was an M.I.T. engineering student in the 1950s. His interest in acoustic engineering piqued, he realized that 80 percent of the sound experienced in a concert hall was indirect, meaning that it bounced off walls and ceilings before reaching the audience.This realization, using basic concepts of physics, formed the basis of his research. In the early 1960s, Dr. Bose invented a new type of stereo speaker based on psychoacoustics, the study of sound perception. His design incorporated multiple small speakers aimed at the surrounding walls, rather than directly at the listener, to reflect the sound and, in essence, recreate the larger sound heard in concert halls. In 1964, at the urging of his mentor and adviser at M.I.T., Dr. Y. W. Lee, he founded his company to pursue long-term research in acoustics. The Bose Corporation initially pursued military contracts, but Dr. Bose’s vision was to produce a new generation of stereo speakers.Though his first speakers fell short of expectations, Dr. Bose kept at it. In 1968, he introduced the Bose 901 Direct/Reflecting speaker system, which became a best seller for more than 25 years and firmly entrenched Bose, based in Framingham, Mass., as a leader in a highly competitive audio components marketplace. Unlike conventional loudspeakers, which radiated sound only forward, the 901s used a blend of direct and reflected sound.Later inventions included the popular Bose Wave radio and the Bose noise-canceling headphones, which were so effective they were adopted by the military and commercial pilots.A Bose software program enabled acoustic engineers to simulate the sound from any seat in a large hall, even before the site was built. The system was used to create sound systems for such diverse spaces as Staples Center in Los Angeles, the Sistine Chapel,etc.In 1982, some of the world’s top automakers, including Mercedes and Porsche, began to install Bose audio systems in their vehicles, and the brand remains a favorite in that market segment.Dr. Bose’s devotion to research was matched by his passion for teaching. Having earned his bachelor’s, master’s and doctorate degrees in electrical engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the 1950s, Dr. Bose returned from a Fulbright scholarship at the National Physical Laboratory in New Delhi and joined the M.I.T. faculty in 1956.He taught there for more than 45 years, and in 2011, donated a majority of his company’s shares to the school.

Technology has played a vital role in bringing India to Global attention. The youth is filled with ambition, vigor and the unfailing drive to chase their dreams. India under thirty is beautiful and very driven. Technology is one of the primary reasons why we are doing well as a country. Education ensures people are forward looking, progressive and become rational, responsible citizens of any country for that matter. India has always been an education driven nation and it gives me immense pride to see so many sections of our society benefiting from education. So education can only give you the push to accelerate and excel in life. It doesn't hold you back. It lets you marvel at anything you do. Technology I don't think is posing as an obstacle to preserving our colorful past. NO absolutely not. Whether we want to preserve our history in any form or the other depends on us as people. It should be a collective effort and we can do that wherever we reside, whatever we do. Technology is a wonderful tool in fact I believe to wonderfully ensure that all that is historical and cultural importance for us can be preserved. Technology can be used in a myriad other ways to promote our culture as well. Therefore, I believe it would be very wrong and at the same time primitive to say that education and technology and the growing wealth of the people in our nation is diluting the tradition and culture of our country.",517 followers,Maṇimēkhalā,701,109,315.4K,2016,https://www.quora.com/Is-it-possible-to-use-boron-as-a-fuel-instead-of-gasoline-or-diesel-technically

So let’s say, I have read or travel a lot; l know that in certain places there are very beautiful people, (not everywhere), so when you visit such places, I know we’ll come across very goodlooking people, it´s not necessary to become jealous due to that; instead I accept that there are different races in our world and those differences makes me UNIQUE. Besides that, what is beautiful for someone, might not be in the eyes of someone else.I got to know myself better, so I know what I like, what I enjoy and I dont, as well.I learnt new things so as to develop some skills, so I know I can move around, and flow with what there is; example, I learnt to drive, I ´ve dared to travel to a new city on my own, I learnt a new language, I took singing lessons, and have sung at special events. That has made me happier, and I feel much better about myself.Then, when it comes to a romantic relationship, I just get to know the person, and aknowledge that if a pretty attractive woman/man comes across, she/he has the right to see her as you would do the same if that was the case, we can all enjoy seeing beautiful faces, but it has nothing to do with our relationship, if you love each other, and are commited in the relationship, this wouln´d have to affect it.One day I went to a T.V set, there were this model-like girls with a tiny waist and in great shape, I felt jealous, well yes, but I also realized I wasn´t working on my body, and that was just a reminder.Jealousy comes from not being confident.And being insecure is a result of not knowing yourself.Then when you know yourself enough and you show yourself as you are, peopple who are close to you is beacuse they like what they see.I think it has to do with accepting what we are.","135,542 followers",Hector Quintanilla,2K,1.2K,88.6M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Is-it-possible-to-use-boron-as-a-fuel-instead-of-gasoline-or-diesel-technically

In my humble opinion a love triangle is a very dangerous place to be.Sadly, my 6th sense has never been wrong. So as far as jealousy goes I embrace it and acknowledge it as a valid human emotion which is painful to feel, but helps you get on the “get out of town bus”.I hope my response helps you sort out your own feelings.
