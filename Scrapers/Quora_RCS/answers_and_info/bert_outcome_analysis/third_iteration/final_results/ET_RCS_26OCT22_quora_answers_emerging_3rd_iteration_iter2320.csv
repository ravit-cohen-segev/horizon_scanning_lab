1,"I am jumping in because most of the answers so far miss the point entirely. The first question is why did civilization emerge after almost two hundred thousand years?The reason is that civilization requires large numbers of people in contained areas. This was almost impossible among foragers (there were some larger societies along great fishing areas, but they were rare). Civilization, cities, large populations, bureaucracies, writing and money all emerged with or some time after the advent of agriculture.

The first question is why did civilization emerge after almost two hundred thousand years?The reason is that civilization requires large numbers of people in contained areas. This was almost impossible among foragers (there were some larger societies along great fishing areas, but they were rare). Civilization, cities, large populations, bureaucracies, writing and money all emerged with or some time after the advent of agriculture. To sustain large populations in a limited area you need to produce food, not just capture nature’s natural bounty. So the answer is agriculture.This leads to the question of why did why did it take so long to develop agriculture. There are multiple possible answers to this, and they may not be mutually exclusive. One is climate (specifically global warming) and the fact that we were in an ice age until ten thousand years ago. Another is that foragers prefer being foragers. It is an easier lifestyle than farming with more freedom, independence, security, and better nutrition. In addition, agriculture and domestication of livestock requires institutional and cultural transitions and changes which are pretty extreme (you need personal property rights for just one example).To put these together we began to see the transition to agricultural and domestication with favorable changes to the weather (warmer, wetter, more consistent climate with more CO2), in cultures which were probably channeled or maybe even forced to adopt the tougher life. Over time some societies developed the proper culture and institutions to make it work. Long term though it led to a hundred fold increase in population and density but a net degradation in average living standards and equality.The second part of the question is the tougher of the two. Why did we see rapidly advancing technology , institutions and human standards of living only in the past 500 years (indeed primarily the last 200). The explanation here is that with the advent of decentralized printing (about 500 years ago), the decentralized but interconnected competing states of Europe formed a larger network of cooperative problem solving. First up was the scientific method which emerged in the 17th C, then the global expansion of Mercantilism as Europe dominated most of the globe. This then slowly transformed into free enterprise (starting with Wealth of Nations in 1776 but known by its haters as ""capitalism""), which enabled decentralized networks of millions of people to cooperate across the globe with corporations, finance, insurance and so on. Finally, a few of these European states stumbled upon the ideas of modern liberalism — democracy, rule of law, divided government, individual rights and so on.Together, the three institutions of liberal government, free markets and science self amplified human problem solving and enlarged it to a national then global level. We learned how to form larger, smarter networks of problem solving while (and this is important) minimizing the problems created especially by exploting each other and obstructing progress.This is is a grossly oversimplified explanation, but it gets to the highlights. Competing but interdependent European states entered an extended arms race where survival and thriving depended upon adopting the three institutions of modernism — free markets, science and representative open access governments. After 1800, life spans, health, freedom, technology, education, tolerance, equality of opportunity and prosperity began to steadily improve for the first time since the human race emerged. These institutions and technologies and benefits have now spread globally.",0 followers,Peter Elvidge,1.4K,2.5K,1.1M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Modern-humans-appeared-200-000-civilization-10-000-and-advanced-technology-500-years-ago-Why-no-advancement-for-something-like-190-000-years
2,"EXPONENTIAL CHANGEThis is a pattern we see everywhere, not just in human development. Many ""time lines"" have this slowly accelerating pattern.

It's called exponential growth and is plotted on one of those hyperbolic curves which start low and slow but become increasingly steep as they approach the right side of the chart, which is always labeled NOW.The evolution of life itself seems to us to have stagnated in its early stages. On the convenient 12 hour clock model of earth’s 4.6 billion year history, life got started surprisingly early at 1:00 or 2:00, but bacteria rule the earth for the next 6 hours! Multi celled organisms didn't develop until 8:00. But things didn't really speed up until an hour ago at 11:00 when we first see fish, land plants, dinosaurs and the cute mammals we care most about, like kittens. And of course, all of human prehistory and history are squeezed into the last frantic minute - with asking and answering questions on Quora being in the last second.A mathematician could probably explain this better, but even intuitively it makes sense that changes through time accumulate exponentially, not in a linear fashion by simple addition. Taking human development as our example, imagine one thing is invented, then another thing. One caveman invents fire, then another invents the spear. These do not simply add together 1 + 1 = 2 to make two steps in human development. Each invention multiplies the uses of the other, not just immediately like being able to cook animals which are hunted with the spear, or throw flaming spears into your enemies cave. These two initial ideas keep multiplying far into the future building on other ideas leading to NASA rocket spears blazing to the moon and beyond. (queue ""Also sprach Zarathustra""(my first answer!

There is a huge gap between “seems” and “actually is”. And even for the things that actually are impossible, it’s quite common for technology to give you something that suits much of the purpose.So a piece of technology may well be indistinguishable from magic, at least at first glance, and probably at second or third. That doesn’t mean it will resist you forever: if somebody else figured it out, you can too.

I had diagnosed chronic depression, anxiety, insomnia, and I was perpetually miserable.But, for some reason, for some unbelievable reason, I was drawn to him that morning.I had to ask him what was wrong. If everything was okay. If he was well.I walked up to him, and said, “Bhaiya, what's wrong?”His eyes.There was something about them. They were eyes I'd seen before — eyes that'd look back at me every time I'd look in the mirror.Eyes that had no trace of hope in them. Eyes that only the broken and beaten carry.He just cried without a single word.I walked inside his auto and I sat down.I gave him some time. He needed me there but he just didn't want to trouble me.I waited for what felt like an eternity, and then he finally told me, “I don't want to live anymore. I'm going to kill myself today. You're the last person I'm talking to.”I said nothing but motioned for him to pass me the bottle of alcohol.Then I took a long drink, and told him to turn the auto to the liquor shop.Four hours — I was with him for four hours that day.I'd drink and he'd drink and he'd tell me about his life.He'd lived a miserable existence. His story makes me tear up even today, this moment, as I write this.The one person — the only person who could see past this lonely alcoholic auto driver that the world could see — to come to love him — recently died.His heart — was shredded to bits. There was nothing he had that he could live for. He'd made his decision.He was going to kill himself.Those four hours passed by in a second.I barely said a word.One bottle of rum after another was opened and we drank — then we got more — and drank more.Words came out of him — one after another — until his chest started to feel less and less heavy with each passing second.My friends walked by and saw me sit in a auto with a lowly auto-driver and drink and they gave me the same look the world gave him.I just didn't leave. I couldn't bring myself to.I was fixated on him — and I didn't know how — but I had to help him somehow.Four hours later, he wiped his tears and said, “Now I'm going to live for you. You saved my life.”That night as I went home drunk out of my mind after saying goodbye, I puked.Then I cried, drank the last of the alcohol I had, and then I puked again to pass out on the floor in a sea of tears and puke.I missed my exam the next morning.One year later, one lonely, miserable night I'd try to kill myself.My best friend would call him because she just didn't know what else to do. She was helpless and she couldn't trust my friends to see me like this.She called him, and he begged to talk to me and I said, “No, bhaiya. This is it. Goodbye.”Seconds passed....then minutes....and the bell rang and my best friend ran to the door because she was afraid to leave me alone.There he stood.Not many people know this, but that night he was there.Fighting with me. Crying with me. Begging me. Asking me to choose to live. He begged, literally begged.He told me, as I couldn't keep my eyes open, that I was the reason he was alive — he just couldn't let me do it.He'd not be able to live with himself.He had a huge part to play as to why I'm alive today.There's something I didn't know that night.When my best friend called him, he was having dinner.Just as soon as he heard that I was going to kill myself, he left his dinner, and he stole his father's auto keys since his had no fuel.His father saw him, and thinking he was going to drink again, he tried to snatch the keys away from him, for them to fight.Yes, they fought.Then, along the way, he'd drive so fast that he'd crash into the divider some distance away from my house.There was a huge dent in his auto that night.He risked his life — and he lived miles away from me.To give you an accurate example, he reached my home within nine minutes — a distance that is almost impossible to cover on any given night.That's how fast he drove.Then, he was here.At my door.To fight for me, with me.A lonely auto driver who I'd spent four hours with on the day he wanted to kill himself.What's the closest thing to magic that actually exists?Kindness — how it magically makes its way back to you.","5,990 followers",Jens Böttiger,566,2.6K,17.6M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Modern-humans-appeared-200-000-civilization-10-000-and-advanced-technology-500-years-ago-Why-no-advancement-for-something-like-190-000-years
