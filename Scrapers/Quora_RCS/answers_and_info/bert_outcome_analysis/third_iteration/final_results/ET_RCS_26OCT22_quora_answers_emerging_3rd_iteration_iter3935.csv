Absolutely zero.Few people understand how many decades of fighting there was in the United States before shots were ever fired.We can trace back government policy whose sole purpose was to prevent a civil war from happening at least 50 years before the civil war broke out. You could even argue it happened much earlier than that. The north/south split was a major and long lasting issue dating back to our founding.The split was so severe that dating back to 1830s, members of Congress would arm themselves on the Senate floor out of genuine fear of getting attacked. This was 30 years before the war. Senators genuinely felt another senator may try to kill him. We have members of Congress bringing arms to Washington today, but it's not the same. They are doing it for optics. They don't genuinely believe Nancy Pelosi or Mitch McConnell are going to shoot them from the dais.This came to a head in 1856 where one member of the house tried to kill a senator. He beat him within inches of his life.We play it off today as quippy anecdote. LOL those silly senators. This is because we're so far removed from that setting that it's impossible for us to genuinely believe this was an attempted murder.During the attack, Charles Sumner was unable to see because he was blinded by the amount of blood flowing over his face. He was eventually knocked unconscious. The other guy continued to beat him anyway.This wasn’t a the result of a temper tantrum. It wasn't some random act. He came there that day to walk up and kill him. He chose a cane because it would be far more humiliating. He was correct, fact it was a cane is exactly why we don't take this event seriously today.The attacker’s allies on the Senate floor even formed a blockade around the two. They were brandishing pistols and threatened to shoot anyone who tried to intervene as pleaded to spare his life. We nearly had a full blown gunfight between congressmen.Eventually, some of Sumner’s allies were able to break through the wall. Cooler heads prevailed, no shots were fired, and the situation didn’t escalate. By this point Sumner's unconscious body was beaten so much the cane had broken into several pieces. This wasn't a simple stick. It was a genuine club with a metal top. One of the many errors in the political cartoon above is it depicts him holding the metal top and striking with the wood. All accounts of the event agree he was striking Sumner over the head with the metal portion of the cane.Sumner survived but needed three years to recover. It is suspected that he suffered brain inquiries. His attacker had to pay a fine and even got reelected.Sumners opponents made commemorative rings out of the broken cane. They proudly wore these on the Senate floor. The man who almost killed him was given many more canes afterward as tokens of appreciation and encouragement. He not only escaped punishment but people thanked him for nearly killing a fellow member of Congress on the Senate floor.The conditions that allowed this outrageous event to take place were quite extreme. Yet, we were still five years away from civil war.A review of the history of the American government and you’ll see that the US was fending off civil war for many decades before it actually happened. Many of the actions of our government in the hundred years leading up the war was about finding solutions to prevent the country from splitting. Most people in government who were either attempting to start or prevent a civil war were deceased by the time the war began. None of the people who fought the war were alive when the possiblity of one first came to light.Looking at things now, yes it looks quite bad. The situation is certainly much worse than 20–30 years ago. This makes a lot of people scream for the hills with “zomg civil war is on the horizon.” It’s not. We’re not even close. What happened was we’d gotten along so unusually and atypically well for such a long time that we’ve lost perspective.This is the norm. Our founding fathers drank heavily and regularly got in fights with each other. They slandered each other in the press. Not just on policy but personal attacks as well. When Burr killed Hamilton in a duel, Burr was the standing Vice President and Hamilton was our top military officer. That's the equivalent of Kamala Harris killing the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.It's just insane how the US was the truly the wild wild west even before the wild wild west. Andrew Jackson also killed many people in duels. Hamilton's son was killed in a duel as well. Nor were they even polite to each other. When John Adams was president, his rivals openly addressed him as a fatass at formal occasions. Can you imagine if Obama introduced Trump at his inauguration as President Fatass? That's just an impossibility today but used to be the norm.We’re also nowhere close to the kind of strife and disunity found in the decades leading up to the civil war. Civil War doesn’t...","5,360 followers",Valerio Cietto,677,2.4K,9.1M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-technologies-will-be-hot-a-decade-from-now

These are powerful armours that can give people additional strength to jump, run or lift heavy weights. And it is not just Iron man who can now do these things. Scientists have been able to invent such exoskeletons already, which can now be made available to general public, very soon. This is surely one of the most popular among additions to the 10 future technologies that already exist.3).Hover CarsHover cars have always been considered too futuristic. People believe that it’s impossible to have cars that can fly and we are happy with thinking of them as part of movies or documentaries. However, this is one of the 10 future technologies that already exist. Israeli scientists have been able to create unmanned battle vehicles for army evacuations.4)CloakingThe idea of invisibility is fascinating. As kids, we all wanted to imagine how it would feel to be invisible. However, we still thought it’s just restricted to realm of imagination. This is another one of the 10 future technologies that already exist. Cloaking devices are already a reality. Scientists in UK have been able to make a paper clip invisible by use of meta materials. This is another addition to the 10 future technologies that already exist.5).Hologram TVsThis would be one of the finest inventions till date.We are all amazed by hologram TVs that we see in Hollywood movies. We look at them in wonder and believe that they are something our grandchildren will enjoy. However, we need not despair. This is one of the 10 future technologies that already exist. Prototypes have already been made and the Japanese broadcaster will have a fully functional version out in 2017.6).Wireless PowerWe are all fed up with devices that need to be constantly charged with a real charger that we need to carry around. The inconvenience of this necessity has given rise to desire amongst people to see a wireless charger. People don’t think that this is available today. However, this is one of the ten future technologies that already exist.

6,"“Ballistic”, which refers to the behavior of a projectile in flight, encompasses everything from a thrown-rock to a precision-guided ICBM, to a linear magnetic accelerator (aka a mass-driver or a rail-gun). Are these the “peak”? Well, it depends how you define “peak”. If you mean are the “peak” of weapons that deliver their effective through kinetic energy, then…yes, I guess, keeping in mind the fact that things like rail-guns are still in their infancy, and as yet probably have a lot of evolution to undergo.But delivering effects through kinetic energy is just one form of weapons effect.

Weapons that deliver their effects through production of acoustic energy (e.g. blast effects) thermal energy (e.g. effects of heat from fire, etc.), other types of electromagnetic energy (e.g. visible light, x-ray, gamma-ray lasers), or particulate radiation (e.g. “neutron bombs”, particle beams) are all, at least potentially—and, in the case of things like nuclear bombs, very much truly—as capable of inflicting harm, if not much more so. Weapons that use effects that are toxic to the human body (chemical weapons) or are based on pathogens (biological weapons) should also be thrown into the mix. And, depending on how generous you want to be in defining a “weapon”, you could also add things like cyber-weapons, for attacking enemy information technology infrastructure, and even psychological weapons, delivered through things like social media, that can influence and shape the behavior of a population. So, if you’re referring to those types of weapons, then “ballistic” weapons aren’t even on the same scale, peak-wise.As usual, the definition of the problem is fundamental to offering an answer.","3,969 followers",Rafael Cavacchini,9.5K,427,8.3M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-technologies-will-be-hot-a-decade-from-now
7,"Ballistic weapons is too vague a term.

The Soviet Union only managed to develop it after spies passed the key information.Otherwise the most complex technology is not any one weapon category or single device, it is the integration of multiple systems/devices to work together in order to facilitate all the functions of say a modern computer, fighter jet or say a reusable rocket like the falcon 9 etc.",UNKNOWN,Common Sense,7.5K,483,3M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-technologies-will-be-hot-a-decade-from-now

13,"Not any time soon, especially for the fast moving ICBM’s, probably not even in the next 20 years. If anti-missile systems improve in say, 15 years, then the military will likely be making the missiles better able to evade the anti-missile technology, too.The 2 land based ICBM interceptors currently in the US have only had a success rate of around 50 % kill rate in tests so far.

You have to bear in mind too, that in tests it is known the missiles to be intercepted will be due very shortly, but in real situations that probably would not apply. Possibly an attack “out of the blue” during a mounting crisis.I always think back to how the multi-billion dollar defence systems failed to protect one of the most heavily protected buildings on Earth, the Pentagon, from a relatively slow moving (circa 500 MPH) plane, even given the luxury of over 30 minutes warning that the US was 100% under attack, once the 2nd tower had been hit. In theory, such a thing could not possibly have happened, or at least the chances of a plane being successful at smashing into the Pentagon should have been miniscule, especially with so much warning time.In the UK we could not even locate what amounted to a toy helicopter over Gatwick Airport given a huge 36 hours, let alone shoot it down. They faffed around, 150,000 people disrupted, military called in, then after all that palava they finally decided there might not have actually been any drone there in the first place. Brilliant!Slow plane, toy helicopter…. nope, can’t get ’em! 100 incoming ICBM’s coming down steeply at 6000 MPH with little warning…………….piece of cake, systems will all work perfectly on the day, though we might miss 5! You decide on how likely that would be in the near future.One problem will always be the human element and chance of error. The serviceman operating part of the system might suddenly become unwell, or make an error. Human control might need to be taken out of the loop on systems that must not fail, or have only a very tiny risk of failure. If a system had to intercept just 1 or 2 ICBM’s, and had many layers of defence, then the chances of intercepting just those ICBM’s would improve and might be nearer to 95%. Not 95% accurate, just multiple less accurate methods to improve the overall chances of success. Slower moving and shorter range missiles would be more likely to be more easily intercepted, again, especially if several interceptors were targeting the same incoming missile. “Iron Dome” and those sort of systems, have already been shown to have been reasonably good, and have stopped some non-ICBM type shorter range missiles from hitting their targets in real life situations, not just tests.",3 followers,Julien Boyer,660,1.3K,6.2M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Are-ballistic-weapons-the-peak-in-human-weapon-technology
