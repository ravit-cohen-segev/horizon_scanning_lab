9,"I'm not sure how legal this is, so don't tell anyone.So in freshman or sophomore year of high school (year 9 or 10), I got banned from using the computer lab for doing this. But, I learned some valuable lessons.Lesson 1: Most people know that on Windows, if you press the Shift key 5 times, the computer emits an ear-bleeding screech, then displays the following window:This window is Sticky Keys, an accessibility feature that lets you press and release keys like Ctrl, Alt, Shift instead of holding them down to make inputting key combos easier.What happens when you press Shift 5 times is WindowsI'm not sure how legal this is, so don't tell anyone.So in freshman or sophomore year of high school (year 9 or 10), I got banned from using the computer lab for doing this. But, I learned some valuable lessons.Lesson 1: Most people know that on Windows, if you press the Shift key 5 times, the computer emits an ear-bleeding screech, then displays the following window:This window is Sticky Keys, an accessibility feature that lets you press and release keys like Ctrl, Alt, Shift instead of holding them down to make inputting key combos easier.What happens when you press Shift 5 times is Windows will try to find an executable file named sethc.exe in the System32 folder and run it.Remember that.Lesson 2: Another really useful feature on Windows machines is they have a recovery mode you can enter before the computer boots up all the way. Usually you have to either hold down F2, press enter 10 times, do a backflip, to the right now y'all, one hop this time, and it will enter recovery mode. This is mainly for trying to restore Windows to a previous version, or recovering information if the computer breaks.Remember that, too.Lesson 3: When you use Windows, even if you don't have to enter a password, you are signed in as a user. Each user has specific access rights and privileges. For example, Administrators usually have more access to system files and settings than regular users do.Ok, so here's where I got in trouble.I'd come into the computer lab during lunch to dink around, play flash games, etc. because I didn't have a computer at home. Eventually, I got my hands on a flash drive that I downloaded games like Goat Simulator and Gmod and the like during lunch breaks. The problem was: I was a student, and the student accounts on the computers were not able to run programs directly off of removable media. So, in order to play my games, I'd have to copy the files over to the computer and run them from there. The other problem was: the school computers had Deep Freeze installed on them, so I'd have to copy them back if I wanted to save my progress.That copying/pasting took way too long.So I thought,But Deep Freeze will revert any changes made to specified drives on the computer whenever they're rebooted, which happened automatically every night. So I could either disable the automatic rebooting and risk some dumb kid turning my computer off accidentally, or I could disable Deep Freeze.*cracks knuckles*I tried deleting the program files for it, but it wouldn't let me. I did some research, and this is where I learned Lesson 3. So I made myself the owner of the Deep Freeze folders, then deleted them.Nice.Except, when I went back to school the next day, it was back.This is where I learned Lesson 2. It was a bit more difficult on the school computers, but I was able to get the computer I was on into recovery mode. Since the “user” that accesses system files in recovery mode is technically the computer itself, it had permission to make any changes it wants. I tried deleting Deep Freeze from here, hoping it wouldn't be reinstalled the next day. Sadly, it was.…Now I did not come to this next conclusion on my own (I think I followed some long-lost YouTube tutorial). But I did figure out how to implement it in this specific situation.When the computer is in recovery mode, since it's mostly there in case of emergency, most Windows features are stripped away (like the basic file explorer), and you're basically left with nothing but a command line. But a command line is a very powerful tool, if you know the commands.Since I didn't have a file explorer, and trying to open one just opened another command line, I opened notepad. Then, I pressed “File”, then hit “Open”.Boom. File explorer. But what good is a file explorer, you ask?To which I reply:With the computer under the assumption that I was trying to open a text file, I navigated to the System32 folder and located sethc.exe, and renamed it to something else (I think it was sethcq.exe or something). Then I found the command line exe (cmd.exe).Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V.I now had cmd.exe and cmd (2).exe. I renamed cmd (2).exe to sethc.exe.Now we're cooking with grease.I rebooted the computer, and since Deep Freeze didn't see anything wrong, nothing was reverted. On the login screen for the computer, before I was even logged in, I press Shift 5 times, and a command line comes up.Success!Using that command line, I made myself a full admin and gave myself full rights to everything. Then I deleted Deep Freeze.Next day, it's back on.I came to find out that there was a program running on a network drive that would reinstall Deep Freeze if it was uninstalled. I didn't even have permission to give myself permission to edit those files, so it seemed like I was stuck. I was an admin on this computer, but I didn't have the login for the network drive.Then it hit me: the computer has to be connected to the network drive in order for the network drive to make any changes. I couldn't disconnect the drive from the computer, butI still didn't have the login for the drive, so what I did is (and keep in mind, I've been doing all this in chunks of 45 minute lunch breaks) I downloaded a full, clean .iso of Windows, burned it to my flash drive (which meant I had to delete all my games, rip. But it's for the greater good), and booted the computer from the flash drive instead of the hard drive. I reinstalled Windows on the hard drive, and voila!The teacher came out, and I was instantly banned from the computer lab.Lesson 4: don't get caught :PEdit:So a lot of the comments suggest I should've just installed my own OS on the flash drive, and they're right. I just didn't think of doing that. The problem I was trying to solve at that point had changed from “how do I play games on the school computer” to “how do I delete Deep Freeze.”","14,230 followers",Saran Udayakumar,2.4K,1K,29.3M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Would-humanity-ever-be-able-to-create-its-own-evolution-or-ascension-someday-though-more-advanced-technology

The sun creates two main types of energy – light and heat – that can be harnessed for many activities ranging from photosynthesis in plants to creating electricity with photovoltaic (PV) cells to heating water and food. PV or photovoltaic power or CSP otherwise known as concentrated solar power which is used for solar heating.For most of human existence, the cooking of food was unknown. Food was eaten in the condition it was found- often raw and spoiled. Through trial and error, humans found that fire could be controlled and used to cook food, as it is essentially solar power stored in the form of wood. Considered in this manner, solar was the first method of cooking on earth.The beginnings of solar cooking, can be traced to several isolated instances in the distant past. The Essenes, an early sect of Jews, gently heated wafers of ground sprouted grains on rocks heated by the desert sun.Solar Cooker TechnologiesIn time, others turned towards solar cookers. The “hot box"" style solar cooker created by Horase de Saussure, a Swiss Naturalist in 1776, was capable of reaching temperatures of about 190 degrees and used in cooking fruits.In India, a British soldier patented a fairly sophisticated solar cooker that looked a lot like the solar chef, which is described below.Today's solar cookers began evolving in the 1950's.History of solar cookingOne of those global problems was the growth of deserts around arid communities. The United Nations and other major funding agencies initiated many studies to design solar cookers that could alleviate some of the reliance on plant life for fuel. Many top engineers of the 1950's were hired to study different aspects of solar cooking designs.The UN then sponsored studies and programs to introduce these cookers into cultures where the need was most apparent.The study did reveal one success. In a northern Mexican community lacking fuelwood, they found that the cookers were still in use five years later. this showed that it was possible to get cookers out to people in need.Cabrito in South TexasPiercing rays of light beamed down on the Chilean village of Villaseca as Luisa Ogalde placed a pot filled withIn another box nearby Ogalde placed rice, which she said would take 40 minutes to cook, and dough, which would need about an hour to become bread.Restobar Solar Entre Cordillera (The owner and executive chef at Restobar Solar Between Cordillera, which opened in 2018, relies upon a set of eight boxes, solar ovens that work by heating meat the same way a parked car heats a human on a hot summer day.Ogalde uses the solar ovens to make other traditional stews, including beef- or chicken-based""We're rescuing all of the old recipes of the area and giving value to the homestyle foods of our grandparents,"" she explained.Yet, while the recipes may be old, the way of cooking them is brand new- a unique melding of past and present.Chile's sun-baked Atacama Desert is known as the driest place on Earth (Ogalde belongs to a generation of cooks who have opened solar restaurants in remote parts of Chile's sun-baked Atacama Desert, which begins just north of Villaseca, ends at the Peruvian border and is known as the driest place on Earth.In a growing trend, increasing numbers of chefs across northern Chile are using solar ovens to cook traditional foods (The movement began decades earlier when Francisca Carrasco (Ogalde's mother), a goat farmer in Villaseca, became a solar cooking pioneer.The goal of the study was twofold. Researchers wanted to help families in this isolated patch of the Elqui Valley to rise out of poverty with a free source of energy, but they also wanted to find a way for them to cook without deforesting the few remaining algarrobo, churqui and carboncillo trees for their traditional wood-burning stoves.Naked Albizia TreeVillaseca transformed into the first village and eventually centralized starting point in Chile to use solar power for cooking, opening countless possibilities.At first it was just people cooking for their families, but foreign tourists began to arrive in greater numbers, asking to see those who cooked with the sun. Over time, participating families made key observations that helped them perfect this new style of cooking. The parabolic solar cookers, they noticed, concentrated heat extremely fast and were a great replacement for things you'd normally do on a stovetop, such as boiling water. Meanwhile, the box-like ovens could both slow-cook stews and replicate a traditional oven for baking bread and deserts.Delicias del SolIn 2000, the association opened its first solar restaurant, Delicias del Sol, with capacity for 24 guests.Qori Inti: El renacer pandémico del restaurant que cocina con la energía del sol - La TerceraIn the tiny desert oasis of Pica, on the far northern end of the Atacama, Ruth Moscoso runs the solar restaurant Qori Inti, which means ""radiant sun"" in her native Aymara language.""In our culture we have a strong environmental awareness,"" Moscoso said. ""So, we said, let's do something that takes into consideration our traditions and our customs of caring for Mother Earth, but also our tradition of being thrifty and optimising what we already have here, which is sun and heat. So, it's really a convergence of tradition and innovation.""The vast majority of Moscoso's ingredients come from her network of local Aymara peopleEating Traditional FoodMoscoso is now innovating again with a special type of solar oven that cooks food inside a glass evacuated tube, which absorbs sunlight and turns it into heat to quickly bake or roast items normally cooked in a traditional oven.-However, one significant difference with this particular style of cooker is that it does not have a real large coking interior compared to that of a box style or panel style solar cooker and regular pots and pans cannot be used at all in this kind of cooker.GoSun Stove Evacuated Tube Design Solar CookerWith the help of a regional grant for small businesses, she purchased six of these solar cookers earlier this yearIn the Chilean capital Santiago, new startup Antu Cocina Solar is launching a similar tube-style solar cooker developed under a circular economy model that benefits both users and the environment by turning plastic waste into a pollution-free appliance for everyday cooking.Clearly, the importance of solar heating and cooking has been overlooked in the archaeological record. In modern times,, solar cooking has remained an under utilized source of energy favored by necessity in the past. Chefs, restaurant owners and those barely eeking out a living highlight the importance solar energy as a renewable source of energy in harsh, fringe and war-torn environments . The recent popularity of solar heating and cooking technologies must seem comical to those who have relied upon them for millennia.",241 followers,Sonali Kerketta,22.4K,0,0,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-most-advanced-technologies-that-people-dont-know-about-yet

It is not remotely responsible to drive a performance car at race speeds on a public road, no matter how skilled a driver you are but you can make a car which is entertaining drive at sensible road speeds by giving it lots of low end torque and grip.Equally even if you look at F1 cars they have relatively modest top speeds given their overall level of performance but what they do have is very very high average speeds.One way this happens is that you add aerodynamic down-force, in road legal cars this tends to be done mostly via ground effect. This saps a bit of power and limits top speed but vastly improves high speed handling. Also you can make a much lighter and stiffer chassis by using composites and clever computer aided design which gain means you get much better acceleration and handling without needing more power.There have also been great advanced in driver aids like semi-automatic transmission, traction control, stability control, active suspension, better brakes and tyres etc etc, all of which improve overall performance and safety without requiring more engine power.Also peak power is not whole story, really for a fun car to drive you want an engine which delivers consistent torque across a wide rev range rather than being mostly sluggish and then suddenly dumping a load of torque once the turbos kick in in which is both frustrating and dangerous.

That is why the McLaren F1 weighs 1,100kg (more than it’s target weight of 1,000kg) and it still had a comparable power to weight ratio than a Bugatti Veyron!!!!Also, as other people have mentioned, the more power you generate, the more you need heat management. That can get heavy and it’s one of the main reasons a Veyron weighs more than 50% more than an F1, despite advances in materials technology over two decades.When driving a normally aspirated car, you can get a thrill from extending the engine to the redline as the peak power and torque on high performance engines, is delivered high up the rev range. This contributes to a fantastic feeling when driving the car.Turbocharged engines however, suffer from lag at low rpm (even though it is well disguised with modern ECU systems) and also do not always provide performance at the very highest rev range. Comparing a Ferrari 458 engine and a 488 engine, Ferrari made great strides to provide more ‘feel’ in the driving characteristics of the 488 to prevent it being unfavourably compared to its predecessor. They even ‘torque limit’ the engine in lower gears, so Ferrari are effectively ‘de-tuning’ the engine in the lower gears to give a more responsive feel.So, in short, ultimate performance was not the objective of the design brief, just a by-product of one of the most talented car designers ever putting into reality more than two decades of sketching his ‘ultimate car’ and a boss of a racing car firm having the balls to back him in a ‘money no object’ project.I feel that like Concorde, we may never see its like again…Hope this helps!","5,990 followers",Jens Böttiger,566,2.6K,17.6M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Would-humanity-ever-be-able-to-create-its-own-evolution-or-ascension-someday-though-more-advanced-technology

There are Christians and Muslims doing the same sort of thing with the Bible and Quran to claim the scientific superiority of their respective religions.But unfortunately, there is no evidence of advanced technology or modern scientific knowledge in ancient times. No scientist or engineer reads religious scripture to come up with new inventions and discoveries. It is always people trying to retrofit modern science and technology into scripture after scientists have done the hard work.

Plenty of the ideas that have been projected could be correct, it’s just hard to prove or disprove who has it right. That alone may qualify it for the “will never figure out” portion of your questions, since even if we’ve already figured it out, we can’t be sure if that’s actually how it was done. A US Naval Academy experiment, using midshipmen trained in complex rigging working alongside historians and archaeologists, couldn’t fully answer the question, so in my mind it feels like it qualifies for your question.

A seal of this precision would not be seen again until some time after the age of enlightenment. Its detail is comparable with early banknote plates (around the C18th CE). The section below is approximately 10mm in view size.No, these optical lenses…Similar dating, Mount Ida, Crete, ca 1400 BCE, however, this may be when the lenses were stored in the Caves of Minos. Made from precision ground rock-crystal (natural glass), see what I mean, with a dividing compass (callipers) one can create an arc to create a lens and critically measure the arc to improve; in this case: optics.Hang on a minute, maybe these white-hulled ships…Santorini (Thera) before the eruption of 1628 BCE. The reconstruction team thought they used flax linen cloth in pine resin (a natural thermoplastic) with limestone powder to make the hull white (a composite matrix) over a wooden frame. The reinforcement is shown inside and out, if the hull is compromised on rocks, it will delaminate, keeping the hull watertight to make landfall and repair, saving the crew, ship and cargo.

If the fabled account of Icarus is correct: the remains of his glider were found at IcariaWe have little idea of what technology the Minoan’s really had, most of it has decayed and is lost to time. The Athenians kept the white hull ship Theseus returned in, it was on display for centuries as a trophy of Athens increasing power. According to myth, Theseus tried to secure magnetite and got thrown off a cliff on Skyros, a source of Magnetite! Athens didn’t know how to make another white-hull, they fell out of use, it is sufficiently advanced that they were unable to reproduce it.A communication network across the Aegean? Well, they had one according to Homer, the fall of Troy was reported to Argos in a few hours using island fire beacons (Peak Sanctuaries which have line-of-sight between them and are present throughout the entire Aegean), e.g. a message relayed at a few hundred miles per hour using long-distance signals, fires at night, gravity cast flat mirrors called Labyrs (double-axe) in the day.Peak sanctuary above.
