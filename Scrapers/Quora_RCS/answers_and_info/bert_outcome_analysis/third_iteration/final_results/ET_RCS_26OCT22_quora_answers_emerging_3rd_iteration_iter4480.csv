I only extracted a few sections out of it conveniently because I only wanted to add on the top of someone else’s knowledge, and put together these concepts like a story so as to inspire the people to think about this subject and begin their own journeys.Big data: The next frontier for innovation, competition, and productivityI will answer a few questions step by step, and wherever possible, I will give a few pictures, or plots to show you how things look like.McKinsey consultants!

4,"Data Scientists are people with some mix of coding and statistical skills who work on making data useful in various ways. In my world, there are two main types:Type A Data Scientist:Data Scientists are people with some mix of coding and statistical skills who work on making data useful in various ways. In my world, there are two main types:Type A Data Scientist:The Type A Data Scientist can code well enough to work with data but is not necessarily an expert. The Type A data scientist may be an expert in experimental design, forecasting, modeling, statistical inference, or other things typically taught in statistics departments. Generally speaking though, the work product of a data scientist is not ""p-values and confidence intervals"" as academic statistics sometimes seems to suggest (and as it sometimes is for traditional statisticians working in the pharmaceutical industry, for example). At Google, Type A Data Scientists are known variously as Statistician, Quantitative Analyst, Decision Support Engineering Analyst, or Data Scientist, and probably a few more.Type B Data Scientist:At Google, a Type B Data Scientist would typically be called a Software Engineer. Type B Data Scientists may use the term Data Scientist to refer just to themselves, and since the definition of the field is very much in flux, they may be right. But I see the term being used most often in the general way I am proposing here.This categorization is crude. Many Data Scientists are some mix of A and B. But this answer is long enough already.","20,170 followers",Sriraman Madhavan,11.7K,186,7.9M,2014,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-importance-of-students-using-technology-to-engage-in-exploring-science-concepts-collection-of-data-and-analysis-of-findings

At the risk of sounding like my dad, I need to say some things about my experience with technology, which is only a fraction of what many of my peers were doing.I was writing papers on an Apple IIe word processor, before my son was even a passing thought. My very first job out of undergrad was coordinating service appointments and inventory for a pc repair company, and the summer before that, I was working on a PC and a Mac (where people my dad’s age were writing, testing and implementing proprietary software). I knew the insides of a PC before most people were even using them at home. I helped hundreds of adults transition from DOS to Windows. I was one of the beta testersfor Windows 95 (the first time the MS Windows GUI resembled the Mac, with a trash can to delete and visible file & folder organization and drag/drop to move and copy those files)… I can keep going up to present day, but I think I have painted enough of the picture.","227,240 followers",Gopalkrishna Vishwanath,20K,11.9K,117.9M,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-importance-of-students-using-technology-to-engage-in-exploring-science-concepts-collection-of-data-and-analysis-of-findings
