We have unparalleled access to information and can connect with other people that share our interests. However, that potent role in our daily rhythms, the ability to do so much at almost anytime, can lead to feelings of tech not always aligning with the complete picture of our needs.Just a couple of the top issues that come to mind when thinking about this tension:Steve Jobs used to call the computerI believe we’re at a turning point; to retain a healthy relationship with our users, tech will need to expand its circle of concern and consider the cumulative effect of not just its own products, but the other ones people are using. I try to do this in my work on digital wellbeing. Going forward, I envision a future where the digital products we use enable us to establish boundaries around our tech use. Right now, for example, I can take my work home with me every day. I’m always available and often don’t think twice about sending an email or text, regardless of the priority. It’s up to me to ignore that email and spend time with my family in the evening. But placing that choice on us for every single email or message isn’t sustainable or even just good design. I’d expect going forward the digital products we use will make it easier to disconnect by having a better understanding of what matters, when it makes sense for me, and when to engage with it.","47,950 followers",Jedidiah Benhur Margoschis Wisely,4K,168,18.3M,UNKNOWN,https://www.quora.com/What-impact-is-technology-having-on-our-daily-lives-and-how-will-it-continue-to-evolve
1,"I think most people have a pretty good idea of how technology is impacting our daily lives. I’d like to discuss the second part of the question, “how will it continue to evolve”. It appears that there are a number of different areas of science and technology that might converge to a “critical mass” in the next few decades or one or two centuries at most (what Ray Kurzweil calls a singularity, to occur by 2045):I think most people have a pretty good idea of how technology is impacting our daily lives. I’d like to discuss the second part of the question, “how will it continue to evolve”. It appears that there are a number of different areas of science and technology that might converge to a “critical mass” in the next few decades or one or two centuries at most (what Ray Kurzweil calls a singularity, to occur by 2045):The synergistic advantages resulting from a fusion of the above technological advances could be the catalyst for a quantum leap in the global human condition, equivalent to a transformation to a new species having capabilities so far above homo sapiens that any comparison would be similar to humans compared to chimps. This new state of existence would result from a completely integrated, seamless fusion of human minds into a global network, merging consciousness so tightly that the collective functioning is equivalent to that of a single entity, thus individuals become nodes in the network, each possessing a level of limitless awareness.Whether this is actually realized remains to be seen, but it is apparent (at least to me) that humanity and technology are on a kind of collision course (more like merging trajectories) and how the two ultimately combine is something that will stay largely unknown and can only be guessed at for the time being. Those who see this as “going to the dark side” might be tempted to make a comparison with the Borg of Star Trek, but it could also be the ultimate in human enlightenment.",366 followers,Brett Alder,1.1K,0,0,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-impact-is-technology-having-on-our-daily-lives-and-how-will-it-continue-to-evolve

Then it was incumbent on the student to decide which source was most reliable.Moving forward in history-like back when I was in high school-if a student was struggling with an essay prompt in his homework, his options were limited. He could keep searching through his text book until his eyes felt as though they’d been dipped in onion juice. Or, he could visit the nearest library and pour through the card catalog looking for books related to the topic at hand. Then it was off to the stacks to find the right books. Some periodical publications may have helped. But the search for tangible information was daunting and relied on manually searching through published sources.As the internet blossomed-like around the time I was teaching-more research of this variety was done online. Students would no longer need to visit the library. They were free to use primitive search engines and read articles only a click away. Along the way, there was the possibility of uncovering unreliable sources (early Wikipedia, I’m looking at you) but by collaboration of sources and thorough research, the student was able to arrive at a decent essay answer.Today, web-based research has e...",34 followers,Rahul Chauhan,7.4K,2.5K,101.2M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-impact-is-technology-having-on-our-daily-lives-and-how-will-it-continue-to-evolve

Locals had a faith that visiting him would be the cure for most ailments. They trusted him. He was god-like.He was also famous in my family circles for his strong atheistic views. Reasoning, logic, and objective approaches formed the very core of his life.My family is deep-rooted in Christianity and thus his stance looked oddly outlandish.He was very rich, at least compared to most people in my family. My mom and dad do not have a car even now. But this man had three cars ten years ago. He was a dog lover. He had five dogs.Frequent international tours. Finest food. Stunning cars. Grand lifestyle. Put all these with this: kind, altruistic, balanced, and charismatic personality.That was him. The perfect package.Naturally, as a young man, I considered him my role model. I could not sense a false note anywhere.The final year of my engineering.He was diagnosed with Pancreatic cancer. The news struck us like lightning. The whole family scrabbled its way to his home.His life came crashing like a meteor. The whole town was in disbelief and shock.Many stupid but concerned questions were raised: “How could this happen to HIM?” “Why HIM, of all people?” “How could this happen to a Doctor?”Regardless of the commotion, his time kept ticking. I remember visiting him during his last two months.I literally stopped breathing for a moment when I entered his home.The curtains had been enveloped with dust. The floor had not been mopped. The beautiful plants outside had started dying. The cars stood there begging for attention.Three of the five dogs had been given away. “He wanted to keep Fido and Henry until…” the maid said with a trembling voice, holding on to my mom.Every face in the home was grief-stricken. Death prevailed in the room. There was an absolute silence in the home. Deafening silence.When I walked to his bed-side, every tinge of charm, glamour, and life his face once had had deserted him. He was pale and lifeless.There were pastors in his home. He had apparently requested for people from all faiths to pray for him. There were bibles all over. Verses from the Quran and bible had been pasted all over the wall.His wife told me about the changes he had been showing ever since the diagnosis. That night, I witnessed the horrors of his pain.I was in the hall and I could hear him wailing in his room. “Someone save me. Take this pain away from me. Jesus, please hear me. I beg you. IS THERE A GOD WHO HEARS ME?”I could clearly hear him sobbing like a 10-year old. I could hear thumps. Slaps. Something clawing the ground. Something being dragged on the floor. Something wriggling.A few minutes later.“Darling, forgive me. PLEASE FORGIVE ME. PLEASE TELL ME I WILL LIVE.. JUST TELL ME…JUST….ahhhhhhh”And then some unintelligible mumbling. Muffled screams. Muted and menacing.This continued for almost an hour. And then, silence, marred intermittently by a woman sobbing. His wife.The next morning, the wife said that such nights had become a norm. She said how badly she wished he died instead of enduring the pain.I heard her crying into my mom’s chests: “Akka, I want him to die, but he keeps saying some miracle will happen and he will survive.”I left his home, but my mom told me of how his final hours were.“He kept begging to ALL the gods before stumbling into unconsciousness.” “He sobbed, pleadingly.”He kept believing in a miracle. He waited.We hold on to so many ideologies. Beliefs. Plans. Rules. Policies. Everything is just a facade.When your oxygen runs out. When the last drop of your blood trickles down. When the last month of your life nears. When the last moment arrives.When your life is on the cliffhanger, the human inside you kicks his way out. Trembling. Begging. Pleading. Disproving all the massive facades you had built all your life.Every brick of the wall you have built will be blown to smithereens. Your knowledge will vanish. Remember, the man who waited for a miracle was a doctor.You and I are fragile. Just wet fluttering tissues.Stop building facades. Be whoever you want to be. Atheist. Religious. Fat. Thin. Rich. Poor. Famous. Obscured.It does not matter. Just Start living while you still can. Love more. Live more. Lose the hatred. Lose the arrogance.’Cause no matter how you choose to live, death beckons.","93,889 followers",Andrew Ferebee,6.2K,611,51.6M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-impact-is-technology-having-on-our-daily-lives-and-how-will-it-continue-to-evolve

Sleep 8 Hours a NightNo ‘ifs’, ‘and’s’, or ‘buts’, you must get 8 hours of HIGH quality sleep everynight if you want to have the best life possible.Sure, you might sacrifice a few hours of productivity, however, if you look at any credible study, the research clearly shows that (unless you have a rare DEC2 genetic mutation) you need 5 sleep cycles to perform at your best.Sleep cycles occur every 90 minutes and, since it takes the average person 20 minutes to fall asleep, going to bed 8 hours before you need to be awake is ideal for optimal performance.5 Sleep Cycles x 90 Minutes = 7.5 Hours + 20 Minutes to Fall Asleep = 7 Hours 50 Minutes + 10 Minute buffer = 8 hours2. Make Sure You Sleep WELLJust because you are sleeping 8 hours doesn’t mean that you are getting 8 hours of quality sleep.To ensure that you are maximizing your “Z’s” I suggest that you:3. Exercise DailyThis might seem a little cliche, but it’s the single most important habit to ensure a high quality of life.If I don’t exercise daily (typically by lifting weights, doing yoga, or riding my bike), I can tell.I’m tired, ornery, and generally a bastard to be around.You need to get exercise as frequently as possible.Your body evolved to move so MOVE baby MOVE!4. MeditateAgain, this is cliche but it works.Taking 10 minutes every morning to sit in silence and simply reconnect with my breath and body has done miracles for my quality of life.Meditation has been scientifically shown to reduce stress, promote empathy, spark creativity, and improve overall well being tremendously.5. LaughThis is a big one that people often forget about.Laughter truly is the best medicine and starting out your mornings with a short stand-up comedy or a few clips from a funny talk show can put you into a positive mood that will permeate the rest of your day.I recommend that you find 2–3 comedians that you really love and purchase all of their stand-ups.Then, when you are cooking breakfast, play the show in the background and let the laughter roll.Oh, speaking of breakfast6. Eat BreakfastSeriously, I know a lot of you are probably avid practitioners of Intermittent Fasting, and that’s great, but unless you are counting calories and know for a fact that you are still getting enough fuel despite your fasting, you need to eat breakfast.It will charge you up for the rest of the day and prevent early afternoon “Hangriness”.7. Get Out in Nature (Preferably Near a Large Body of Water)Getting out in nature has been shown time and time again to be a HUGE factor in a person’s overall happiness and well being.We’ve evolved over the past 6,000 years to be surrounded by nature, not concrete.Make it a priority to get out in nature for at least 30 minutes a day.You won’t regret it.8. Connect with Someone You Love Every DayThis is a simple habit that will instantly and dramatically improve your quality of life.Humans are inherently social creatures and, despite the massive technological advancements we’ve recently experienced, we are more disconnected and solitary than ever before.Everyday I challenge you to connect with someone you love.Whether you Skype your mom, sit down for coffee with your girlfriend, or go hang out with amigos at the bar, spend at least 10 hours a week really connecting with people that you care about.9. Express GratitudeEvery single day ask yourself the question, “What do I have to be grateful for?”If you answer that question each morning when you wake up and each night before you go to sleep, I promise your life will change forever.10. RelaxDo something fun everyday.Play guitar, play video games, read a good book, walk by the beach.Just do something that will make you happy and help you relax.Your mind, body, and spirit will thank you for it.Stay Grounded,Learn more about my work and mission by visiting my Quora profile",511 followers,Anurag Tiwari,16.2K,63,526.7K,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-impact-is-technology-having-on-our-daily-lives-and-how-will-it-continue-to-evolve

The question is about life expectancy which will vary based on the probability of individual's in a population [in their particular settings] expectations of survival.As a result, life expectancy will vary based on the risks intrinsic to the individual.  Whether this be due to social conflicts, exposure to diseases, or access to resources [i.e. starvation].What is misleading is that some individuals are long-lived without regard to technology.  In other cases life expectancy increases are due simply to shifting of averages [i.e. reduction in infant mortality].  None of these is particularly helpful in analyzing the risks to an individual.Modern technology has made improvements but it has also increased some liabilities.  Most of the claims regarding improvements in life expectancy are based on shifting averages.  In other words, individuals that might otherwise have died may be saved which causes the average to shift upwards even though no one may actually live longer.However, in many cases, the technology is necessary to help people survive that might never have been at risk without the same technologies.  For example, modern medicine can do a great job at dealing with traumatic injuries and yet many of those traumatic injuries are the direct result of modern technologies too [i.e. car accidents].Presently modern technology is also potentially increasing the risk to individuals with pollution, sedentary life styles, etc.  So basically I don't think there is a single simple answer to the question.","105,672 followers",Dave Consiglio,742,6.8K,91.6M,2014,https://www.quora.com/What-impact-is-technology-having-on-our-daily-lives-and-how-will-it-continue-to-evolve
