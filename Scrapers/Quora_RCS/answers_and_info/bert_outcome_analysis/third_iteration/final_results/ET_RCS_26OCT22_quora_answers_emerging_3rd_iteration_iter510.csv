It is very difficult to describe how one gets admitted because it is a subjective process based on a variety of factors.But let me say that of all the answers below, Anonymous is closest to the truth.  Simply put, you need a 'hook', which means something so special that it is pretty rare.  (A hook is also known in the admissions business as an 'institutional need', something that the schools want but will never tell the public about.  Div 1 athletes, children of major donors or celebrities, best in state, best in nation, academic superstars, someone who is published in a major publication, etc are examples nationally.  MIT has its own institutional needs that their outstanding admissions office works hard to identify and admit.)  Note that this is not just high scores and perfect grades, as most people believe.  It's different.As Anonymous says, for MIT  be world-class at something (accent on 'world class'), crush school (that's right - crush it, no excuses) and build writing and interpersonal skills so you can communicate effectively with others.MIT people are action people so the admissions office is looking for people who regularly make things happen for themselves and others with great self-initiative.  A deeper than normal curiosity is critical because that screams MIT.  And a fearlessness is necessary because not only is MIT the most extraordinary university of its kind on Earth, it's also one of the most demanding.  (There's no place to hide in the curriculum there as one can in Ivy schools.)  Each of these attributes must be represented by actual evidence in the case.  But it's the hook that gets one admitted.If I could tell future applicants anything, it is to understand the culture of the individual school and see if you are a match.  For example, MIT is an action place and so is well suited for action-types and not really that suited for intellectual types.  Also, do not pick a college based on ranking.  That's just ignorance.  All ranking systems have been designed to sell products so they are neither neutral authorities nor really true. You must learn about schools yourself in this era of Big Spin.  That takes work.And most importantly, don't take advice about college admissions from anyone who has never admitted for a living.  Your friends and parents know nothing about such an arcane process and do what we all do - make assumptions about how it appears to work and then act on the assumptions they just made up as if they were true (a process I refer to as M.S.U. - making sh*t up).  That never ends well since it isn't based in truth.I hope this helps.","1,341 followers",Marilee Jones,2.1K,0,0,2015,https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-get-direct-admission-into-Bangalore-Institute-of-Technology

But we do have key things that will shift our thinking into that we are technologically superior.Arms ExportsThe USA has led the world in arms exports since atleast 1950 with more than $47 billion dollars in sales per year. Russia comes in second with around $33 billion. Let’s say Russia is selling a pistol and the USA is selling a pistol, the countries test and deem the USA one “better” thus the world would prefer the pistol made in the USA rather than Russia. It begs the question, Why would the world buy a product that is inferior to the other? Countries aren’t stupid, they try to spend their money wisely when choosing weapons of different varieties. They will throughly test and score which is better. Which ever they deem is “better” they will most likely purchase. Also, sometimes the cost of the product will be a factor but rarely is.Battle TestedThis might stir the pot but let’s not. The USA has been at war for the better part of the 21st century and one of the enemies whom we later defeated, was a rather menacing enemy in the world and the Middle East. America’s equipment has been put to the test. Going up against a well established military (Iraq) and militias (Afghanistan). In both conflicts, equipment performed tremendously well. The USA lost 2 planes in the entire conflict, one was lost due to friendly fire, and the other was shot down by a Surface to air missile while it was performing a “gun run” and was rather close to the ground. The M1A1/A2 Abrams tank has so far when in control of American crews has not been lost due to enemy fire. The Abrams has only been lost due to friendly fire and even then they weren’t “lost” most could be repaired but some were scuttled in order to keep the enemy away from the classified controls and systems. Also, American weaponry performed really well with the M-16A4 working well as always. And the M39 EMR, and MK 14 EBR making a stunning appearance for the first time in combat and it was a phenomenal rifle, according to my cousin who used it and trained with it and I’m sure from people who use it.VouchingIt really shouldn’t be any doubt in anyone’s minds that America’s Nimitz-Class and forth coming Ford-Class Aircraft carriers are the best in the world. Only 1 country outside the USA has nuclear powered carriers and that’s France with only 1 which is the R91 Charles de Gaulle. Also, they are the longest in the world and can carry almost double the amount of planes of the next carrier with around 95 planes. The US’s Seawolf-class submarines are among the most quietest in the world, with experts saying that a seawolf traveling at 25 knots underwater is quieter than an Akula III Class...",2 followers,Sean Emory,1K,195,362K,2018,https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-get-direct-admission-into-Bangalore-Institute-of-Technology

Most modern lifesaving trauma care is pioneered by the military. How could that be, you ask? Well, when it comes to saving troops who are bleeding out from IED strikes, military doctors don't give a shit about approved treatments if the options are down to definitely-dead-grunt or snowball's-chance-in-hell-of-live grunt-if-I-try-this.

Once the forms were all signed, they rolled it up, and we were all disappointed. It was just a regular Jeep with a big box on the back.It turns out the magic was in the box. It was a highly accurate (for the time) Global Positioning System (GPS). This was the first time I had heard of the technology, but GPS service was first made available for civilians in 1983. However, for national security reasons, the Pentagon decided to scramble the signal, making it too inaccurate to be reliable. This practice was known as “selective availability” and was aimed at preventing military use of our GPS technologies by our enemies.Way back in 1960, the Navy launched Transit 1B, the first US navigation satellite. The launch marked the beginning of the US Navy Navigation Satellite System. The system was developed primarily to guide Navy missiles.In May 2000, President Clinton ended the practice of selective availability for GPS and the technology became widely available to the public. When selective availability was lifted in 2000, GPS had about a five-meter (16 ft) accuracy.The United States government, however, retains the right to selectively deny access to the system (as they did to the Indian military in 1999 during the Kargil War) or downgrade the service at any time. Because of this, many other nations have developed, or are in the process of developing their own global or regional satellite navigation systems.This was a roundabout way to answer the question, but in this particular case, the deployment of the initial technology came about 40 years before meaningful use was made available to the public.","20,087 followers",Ben Kolber,11.1K,324,21.6M,2020,https://www.quora.com/If-advanced-military-technology-is-kept-top-secret-why-is-the-U-S-so-certain-that-they-are-the-most-advanced-military-in-the-world

You look at what the F-22 and F-35 have and can guess those are the technologies he was talking about in 1994 that was demonstrated as possible in the 1970s.A couple of guesses would say ram jet technology, high levels of stealth, and almost silent engines that provide exceptional speed, talking Mach 3 or higher, in the aviation world. We saw fantail tech on a Blackhawk during the Osama Bin Ladin raid, which significantly reduces the noise levels of a helicopter.The satilite tech is probably a place where advanced tech is most likely to be deployed. They might not be able to read your newspaper in a building (we know they can if you step outside) but probably can tell you how many people are in it.Could they have the tech to see through walls using thermo for special mission guys? Probably.They were working on a 10K generator concept that would fit in your hand and use a thimble of fuel a day in 1995. If they ever accomplished that it would provide special ops a wonderful power source for supporting comms. On the other hand think what that would do for an electric car.I would say the areas of advancement are capable in many areas but if they are working in electronics it is in the area of taking cutting edge and using it in a new way. The whole concept of miniaturization has been something they have been focused on, so I would say small surveillance capabilities is there. Remember the more stuff a soldier can carry the more contingencies they are prepared to deal with when they are out of range of support. That means the equipment need to be small and light. Could there be phones the size of a Next Generation Star Trek communicator (remember the Federation Symble), sure but it would only be a comms device and not a phone/small computer as you hold in your hand today but an effective non-traceable form of communication.Large armor formations are not reasonable based on current kill capacities of other systems. It is a reason Gen Shenseki wanted to study energy shields in 2000.I don’t know where they are on most of these type items but it is hard to guess what is capable, because it is kept for a real emergency that regular capabilities can’t deal with or if we need a special advantage and keep in mind our ability to deal with problems is pretty significant with normal weapons. Remember we can blow a place up from thousands of miles away without the target even knowing it’s coming. Unless you are in the R&D community you are only guessing and the guys who truly do know are not going to say what new capabilities exists. I would say most people who say they know the specifics the military can do really don’t know much as the people who do that stuff don’t talk.

And, if you are responsible for certain repairs on a certain type of weapon, that is all you will know. You will not NEED TO KNOW how many of these devices exist, or what they do, or where they are.  The same is true with all types of electronic equipment; you may need to know how to operate it, but you do not need to know HOW it operates.  For example, we all know how to operate a cell phone and a computer, but we do not need to know HOW it works, or how many of them there are on this planet, or where they all are.    Someone may need to know how to repair your computer or cell phone,  for example, but they do not need to know what information is on YOUR phone or computer, or who you communicate with.  And, even most important, people have to follow these Need to Know rules.  For example, the president may need to know how many carriers the navy has, but he does not need to know how to operate one, or how to fly a plane off of one.  So, if the enemy really wanted to compromise some really valuable information, they would have to compromise more than one person, working in different workshops.  And since nobody really knows anything about what everyone else does, gathering all that Need to Know information would be VERY difficult.  Bottom line is you will only know what you NEED TO KNOW for your specific job.  It does not matter if you are senior or junior.  If you start getting too curious, you will be reported.   And of course, never forget that the enemy does not have this information, or they would not be asking.  When John McCain was being tortured for a list of names of people in his command, he gave them a roster of the Green Bay Packers.  Others volunteered information on nuclear-powered jet aircraft, and other pure lies to avoid torture.  If the enemy does not know, you can pretty-well give them any BS story to avoid torture.  The bottom line is simply that torture does not work unless they already know the correct answer, and if they already know, why would they torture you?  So it is very difficult to get any really valuable information from only one source, and even more difficult to ensure the information is really valuable.","3,454 followers",Matti Porkka,664,1.8K,16.2M,2021,https://www.quora.com/If-advanced-military-technology-is-kept-top-secret-why-is-the-U-S-so-certain-that-they-are-the-most-advanced-military-in-the-world

There is a lot that happens in real-time and thoughts that get shared outside of a written blog post. I love leveraging Twitter to find and “keep up” with various influencers as well as identify new ones that may not blog or speak at big conferences but have great insights on the industry. I’ve created various lists and group them into different areas of interest or specialty, so I can dive into a specific topic.It takes a dedicated focus to try and keep up because the industry, like many that are digitally influenced, that is moving at such a rapid pace. I’d recommend reading/subscribing to a couple of the more broadly focused blogs (e.g. MarTech), do the same on a certain area of focus (e.g. Advertising), and then monitor/scan twitter to create those groups and find others in your chosen specialty.Hope that helps, it’s definitely a challenge!",85 followers,Andrea Del Pico,2.9K,0,0,2017,https://www.quora.com/If-advanced-military-technology-is-kept-top-secret-why-is-the-U-S-so-certain-that-they-are-the-most-advanced-military-in-the-world

This is true for STEM and non-STEM degrees alike.The value of a college education isn’t really about the degree.It’s about two things related to the experience of getting a degree:Do you know why Wharton and Harvard Business Schools are “better” than, say, Ohio State University? It is not that the academics are that much harder. It is not that the professors are that much smarter. It is not that they do better research. Indeed, none of those things are really true.What makes them better is that they have alumni associations that are exceptionally active, wealthy, connected and helpful by comparison.Why does that matter? Because when you say “gosh, I’m looking for a first job, I’d like work at Company A” the next question in your mind should be “Who do I know who works at Company A or who knows someone who does?”If you went to Harvard, you contact the alumni network and start the search and you’ll find someone.If you went to Ohio State, your ability to make that same connection is lower. And that makes the degree less valuable.The key to making your degree valuable isn’t the degree. It’s working hard, even when you don’t want to do so, and being as socially active and engaged as you possibly can.If you do those two things, then you will end up with a degree that you can use to start a career.If you don’t, then every degree is equally without value.",2 followers,Shubham KP,10.1K,359,11.6M,2019,https://www.quora.com/If-advanced-military-technology-is-kept-top-secret-why-is-the-U-S-so-certain-that-they-are-the-most-advanced-military-in-the-world

Our team at Grammarly has compiled a handy list of common grammatical errors to help make your writing accurate, clear, and professional.Ambiguous (“Squinting”) modifiersA squinting modifier is a misplaced modifier that, because of its location in a sentence, could modify either the phrase that precedes it or the one that follows it. In the example sentence, is the subject listening to music slowly or slowly getting a headache? To correct a squinting modifier, move its position in the sentence to clarify to the reader which word you intend to modify.Misuse of lie/layIf you plan to place or put an object somewhere, such as a plate on a table, you should use “lay.” If you intend to stretch out on a bed for a nap, you should use “lie.” The verb “lie” is an intransitive verb, which means it does not need an object. The transitive verb “lay” requires an object.It may take some getting used to this “lay” or “lie” business; after all, misuse of these verbs is common. But if you remember to lay down your fork before you’re full, then you won’t have to lie down later from overeating.Comma splicesHe was very hungry, so he ate a whole pizza.To splice means to connect or join. When a writer joins two independent sentences with a comma instead of separating them with a period or coordinating conjunction, that’s a comma splice.The comma has its jobs to do, but connecting two independent sentences isn’t one of them. Besides, the period gets testy when his sister, the comma, steals his thunder. Periods have their jobs, and so do commas, but never the twain shall meet—unless it’s in the form of a semicolon. Semicolons can also take the place of a coordinating conjunction, such as “and,” “but,” or “so,” among others.Run-on sentencesRun-on sentences, also known as fused sentences, occur when two complete sentences are squashed together without using a coordinating conjunction or proper punctuation, such as a period or a semicolon. Run-on sentences can be short or long. A long sentence isn’t necessarily a run-on sentence.To avoid run-on sentences, see if there is more than one idea communicated by two or more independent clauses. In our examples, there are two complete sentences:Example:Example:Both sentences are complete ideas by themselves; therefore, use a semicolon or a period to indicate that they are separate independent clauses.Using “could of” instead of “could have”“Could have” is always correct; “could of” never is. Writers probably make this grammar gaffe because, when we speak, the contraction “could’ve” sounds an awful lot like “could of.”TautologiesTautologies express the same thing twice with different words. In our example, the word “made” implies that Jack used his own two hands to create the pail. The prepositional phrase “with his own hands” creates a redundancy. Once you know what they are, it’s fun to discover tautologies: dilapidated ruins, close proximity, added bonus, large crowd...The list goes on and on!After reading through this list of common grammatical mistakes, you might be wondering how to remember all these rules as you write.

I am in my final year engineering, in an okay college affiliated to the University of Mumbai.I will divide each experience as per the following:1. Experience in Abu Dhabi:a . My dad is rich. My friend's Dad is rich. Everyone is rich (At least everyone's parents were earning a good salary). we get everything we want So why study?There was absolutely no competition and the need to study.Who wants to study when you have birthdays, friends' parents' anniversary to attend, dad's new luxury car to drive, visit the amazing malls, spend money​ etc?b. The teachers teach at low salaries. They don't have proper qualifications and come on their husbands visa. I studied in a private ""reputed"" school that was affiliated to the CBSE board. So I wonder what its like in less reputed schools.c. The education system is not good. Its not competitive and you don't really learn a lot. Studying 3 hrs a day is what you'd call a sincere serious student.2. Experience in CanadaI lived in Mississauga in Grade 4 then moved to Burlington, grade 5 to grade 8. I attended one and half a month of high school.a. It was tough at the beginning. My dressing sense was horrible and I took A LOT of time trying to fit in. I didnt wear deodarant, I didnt have a bf,b. The teachers are very nice and friendly and know what they teach perfectly. Well, there wasn't much to teach anyways. Most of what was taught, I had already learned in Abu Dhabi. It was a breeze.c. The education system makes us students think and analyse. Enough time is given for assignments and you are not allowed to plagiarize. There are a wide variety of actives, that allow you to discover yourself. Choir, orchestra, cross country, silver birch, movie making club, sports like lacrosse, basketball, volley ball, EVERYTHING. The list is way longer when you get into high school.A lot ofForLanguageMusicGymMathFrenchHistory and GeographyArtHere are a couple pictures on how we were evaluated:​​We had to make our own newspaper with different articles as our English project.​​Math project. We had to design an amusment park, and then calculate the total area of the park. I used a variety of shapes, and sizes.​​​​Science test that I aced. But later flunked Indian science. I got 1/10, in my first physics test. But in the next semester a 9/10. Getting that paper was THE best moment.​​​In french, in this project, we had to think of our own world, make a picture of it, and then explain it. I made my own ice cream world :D3. Experience in Indiaa. India is very very competitive. We start right from the morning. Competition at the bus stop, competition when buying vegetables. We see a wide variety of people. People who are rich poor middle class, all types. Everyone wants a good career and job. Hence Huge competition in academics. Entrance exams! That is all that's on a students mind. Extra curricular activities are a waste of time. You can do that after you get into a top college, read IIT.b. The teachers are different. They are strict and intimidating. It took me a while to get used to the teachers here. Most of them know their stuff.c. Indian education is tough. I had joined ICSE and it was even more tough. My physics sir asked me what I learnt in science in Grade 9. I told him the water cycle. He laughed and told me I have to work real hard.  I did. I I still work hard just to keep in pace with the average students, let alone the ""topper"".Indian Education focuses onBut in India, everyone knows the basics of science and mathematics. Everyone is intelligent. Every one studies hard for those last 2 days before an exam.I graduated elementary high with an honor in Math in grade 8 (Canada), in grade 9, I failed Indian Math. But then I worked hard and passed. I was used to finding the area of a square in Grade 8, suddenly in garde 9, I had to memorize (a+b)^2, and a whole bunch of difficult formulas. In semester 4 of my 4 year long engineering course, I got a 71. I improved.In Canada, my teacher took 5, 30 minute periods to explain surface tension, and to complete the whole project, perfectly. Indian teachers, ""explain"" a whole chapter in 30 minutes. Eg. Indian teachers explain 10 concepts Students grasp 5, and are unclear with 2 and have no clue with 3. Indian students learn more. Instead of learning 1 concept, they learn so much more.Most Indian studentsIndian students don't work on projects. TheyI remember getting 2 periods of gym in a year. Teachers think it is aAll Indian students do is study(not all, most). In Canada we had lessons on security(A lady constable was called and she gave everyone tips.), on sex (Grade 6), drugs (we were put in different situations and were asked to react to those. I was asked if I'd like to try ""drugs"", and I said no, and gave a stern look. The constable said I said ""No"", correctly. :D )I still think Indian Education is the best. Like I said before, Indian students learn more. Yes, many Indians are not confident, Most of us don't have a great dressing sense, don't know how to play instruments, but most Indian Students are intelligent, have a great memory and always areAlso, when you are from India, you can probably adjust to most countries. Places like UAE, London, Canada, USA are so much more cleaner and aesthetically designed.UPDATE: So I see a lot of comments telling me that they see a bit of sarcasm, and that my answer is biased and flawed.I think math and science is everywhere, in daily life. You buy stuff, you deposit money in a bank. In India, profit loss shares dividend simple interest, compound interest, balance credit, is taught from the early ages. This is not taught in Canada. I learnt simple interest in grade 8 in canada. Principal, rate and time is give, you just calculate the Simple intrest. No tricky sums, nothing.Didn't you see how easily I got 15/15 in that science test. It was a piece of cake. I wrote practically 1 sentence and to the point answers and aced it. I thought I was the smartest person on earth. I came to India, and I got 1/10. I am trying to point out how slow paced the Canadian system is. I am trying to say, in India we learn so much and is much more superior to any other system, I believe.Indian students get over with the hard difficult stuff first. Then we explore different areas like makeup, fashion etc.Indian students, all of them, know how a bank functions. Know how your money gets interest. Indian students know what fixed deposit is. In Canada only commerce students might know that, but whatever they do specialize in, know everything clearly. But people in Canada who haven't taken up commerce will have to go to the people who have taken commerce and ask them for guidance. Indian's dont need this guidance. They can take their own basic decision's. Although, if they still want to organize more efficiently, they can ask finicial advisors etc. But I'm trying to say, that we have the basic, practical knowledge.As a whole, Indian students are knowledgeable. This is why I feel the Indian education system is much more superior to any other system.**This answer was written on 24 Dec 2013.Want to read more about the difference?","1,594 followers",Michael Van In,632,1.5K,2.9M,2016,https://www.quora.com/If-advanced-military-technology-is-kept-top-secret-why-is-the-U-S-so-certain-that-they-are-the-most-advanced-military-in-the-world
