2,"It doesn’t really look like anything.Let me try to explain why.You can write using a ‘high level language’, lets say in CThis (actually very low level) bit ofC code creates a ‘pointer’ to an address in memory of 4000 (hex), and then writes a value of 55 (hex) into it. You sometimes see things like this as part of memory checks. You would then read back that memory address and check that it still contains 55; if it does, that piece of memory is probably working.Anyway.The C compiler will then translate this into some representation of machine lIt doesn’t really look like anything.Let me try to explain why.You can write using a ‘high level language’, lets say in CThis (actually very low level) bit ofC code creates a ‘pointer’ to an address in memory of 4000 (hex), and then writes a value of 55 (hex) into it.

Mysterious, inscrutable binary. The land of experts and nerds.But inside the processor chip and its memory chips, these things exist as voltage levels that vary over time. Inside the Z80 chip, there are no binary numbers. None.There are only voltages.TheseEverything else - yes, even binary - is a human readable representation.The higher up the language chain we go, the more readable it becomes. The closer it is to how we think and reason about technical problems.But it is all just a representationMachine language is just voltages which we cannot see, except as some representation.","3,379 followers",Geraldine Cheung,919,531,8M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-technology-will-replace-0-and-1-machine-language-with-a-single-digit-language
3,Televisions concealed in a glass panel so it just looks like a pane of glass (already exists) or pretty much a hologram. Flat screen displays will simply get thinner with less components needed to run them. Eventually the phyisical display itself will disappear. They could eventually be a device the size of a hockey puck that you put on a shelf and turn it on to create a big projected display.Time will tell!,0 followers,Daryl Larsen,1.8K,2.4K,2.2M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-technology-will-replace-0-and-1-machine-language-with-a-single-digit-language
