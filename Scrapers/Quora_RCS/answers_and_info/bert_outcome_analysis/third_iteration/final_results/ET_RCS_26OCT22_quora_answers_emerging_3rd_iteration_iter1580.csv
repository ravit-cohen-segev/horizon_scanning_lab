Dad was a skilled union journeyman carpenter and a Chicago firefighter. Mom was a stay- at- home housewife who had all the answers about what a college education can and should entail, mainly gleaned from watching television talk shows and listening to the hearsay anecdotes of her social circle.My dad should have gone on to college. He was a voracious reader, and he always was fascinated by engineering. Being a veteran of the Second World War, he certainly had a GI Bill that would have paid for his education. He chose to get married and find work: I understand how after surviving a depression and a world war living a quiet normalcy had its appeal. But he never pursued an education that I believe he would have done well at. He would have been a good designing mechanical or structural engineer. He had a finer mind for technical detail than I ever did.I’ll spare you the details, but essentially because I chose to do things my way and not my parents’ way, I received zero financial help as to college tuition and other higher educational costs. I paid my own way through, at a time in history when that was still possible. That meant community college and a state university. AIt was the card I was dealt. I played it, eventually getting through law school and passing my state’s bar exam on the first shot. Once I was a licensed attorney, I did get appreciation from them for what I had done: my mother even admitting (as I stood before her in my doctoral robes when I got the law degree) that they were wrong, and I was right about choosing my own way of doing things. Better late than never: I’ll take it.I’d be the last one to say that I was particularly astute when it came to studies, or that I worked incessantly. I did, however, always understand that",0 followers,Mira Rose,22.1K,340,3.5M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-do-you-think-the-next-generation-of-learning-through-technology-would-be-like

11,"Well, for the starters, Let’s understand a little bit about the role of CA in the current scenario. We all know that, every field of work, be it business, profession, art, politics or a social welfare organization, cannot simply run without finances. And where finance is involved, A CA is inevitably involved. CA is one profession that can have a far reaching utility in every field of work. So, we want to know how technology can disrupt this field.We all know the pace of technological development in the current world. Let’s take for example, AI, which is the hot topic in the world. Billions ofWell, for the starters, Let’s understand a little bit about the role of CA in the current scenario. We all know that, every field of work, be it business, profession, art, politics or a social welfare organization, cannot simply run without finances. And where finance is involved, A CA is inevitably involved. CA is one profession that can have a far reaching utility in every field of work. So, we want to know how technology can disrupt this field.We all know the pace of technological development in the current world. Let’s take for example, AI, which is the hot topic in the world. Billions of dollars are being invested to harness it’s potential. It started in 1997, when IBM’s deep blue computer was the first AI machine to defeat a russian chess grand master. In 2013, Boston Dynamics introduced a robot named “Big dog” which could make it’s way over rough terrain, including snow, uphills, If it slipped it could right itself, If you push it over it can put itself back up, and it’s all autonomous. And it’s robots have only been advancing. Which means they’ve been learning and getting better and better. The last iteration was released 2 months ago, a quadrapedel robot, which can do perfect dance for music. As fluid as a human can get. Let’s take Tesla for example, which makes autonomous cars. Anything autonomous, is a robot. And one of the features of the car, is that they map the roads. And when they are mapping them, they will share the data. And it’s getting to a point where, the car can predict where the bumps on the road actually are and when we are approaching it adjusts the suspension so we don’t feel anything. And one more company called ‘Soul Machines’ was born 4 years ago. Which has use AGI to create a Digital brain which was used in designing intelligent and emotionally responsive digital avatars. So in time, we will see a lot of digital marketing will be done by these avatars. And since we are discussing CA, we must also talk about the company named ‘MindBridge’, which now the world’s leading tool for detection of risks in financial statements, which acts as a tool for accountants, auditors and financial professionals. There are many leading startups, even in the field of health care. These AI powered machines can diagnose the patient health conditions and report on the same with just an aid of either a physical scan or a real time virtual scan of the patient. We can go on and on with these examples as AI has set it’s mark in every industry so far.So in the light of all of the above, we can only remotely imagine what’s likely to happen in the next 20 years. We need to understand that any autonomous AI machine in it’s fundamental sense have a much higher computational capacity than human brain. Which means it can learn things much faster. So the pace of advancement can only go up in this case. And one more thing we must know about them is that, they all share data. If we have one machine that learns 1 thing a day, A 20 million machines can easily learn 20 million things a day. This is no science fiction, it’s happening real time. Take Tesla cars for example, All the cars are structurally same, but each of them learn different things in different circumstances and all that data is shared.Coming back to your question, Whether technological advancement can make CA degree worthless in the next 20 - 30 years? Well, When the ATM was invented, bankers suddenly had a lot less to do. Since fewer people were going into the banks to withdraw money, this allowed bankers more time to engage in higher-value services, such as insurance, mortgages and stock trading. Similarly, When automation takes place, sure enough there is going to be job loss because almost 45% of the activities we perform today can be easily be taken by AI. This means, jobs will get smaller and smaller and we will have more free time in our hands to do more creative and futuristic things that actually makes the world a better place to live. For this we need new skills and talent. Therefore, it’s really important to continuously change with the changing dynamics of the world. And it’s important to choose a degree that will steer clear of all those industries that will be most affected. According to forbes, 65% of senior financial management expects impact on financial services industry. And it’s a well known fact, that Finance jobs requiring AI and machine learning skills are a growing.In this regard, I can only conclude by saying, Irrespective of the choice of profession, It’s really important to see for yourself, What the world is rewarding. And continuously learn new skills to keep up with the pace of the world.","5,084 followers",Bobby Tatro,3.9K,2.2K,45.6M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-do-you-think-the-next-generation-of-learning-through-technology-would-be-like

And unless you're a niche auditor or a information systems auditor, being a CA will not give you the tools to understand that sector perfectly. You might have to take additional classes or try your hand at another course.But you're going to be learning International Taxation in CA, and International differences will never go away, and with greater linkages to the market, you'll see people more often buy, sell and eventually set up businesses in India from foreign countries, and vice versa. So doing CA will set you up in a unique position where you will be the preferred advisor, especially if you have the knowledge.Same in forensic audits, even if tax audits are probably going to be rare if the current Government stays in power which is extremely business friendly in terms of tax. Utilizing and finding out fraudulent behaviour is going to be the key ahead, as businesses are transacted more online, and data will be more easily hidden behind the scores of transactions.There are other areas, like financial advisory, compliance, corporate advisory, and so on which won't go away. They're much more niche areas that will exist.And yes taxes will exist. Even if Income Tax is withdrawn, it will mean a lot more Indirect tax and a lot more compliance since you can't accept slippages there. More likely there will be amendments rather than withdrawals anywhere. Taxes won't just go away, that's just impossible.And finally CA is a means to an end. You can add other degrees. Become an advocate and go into higher levels of corporate, or work with Governments. You can also run your business, and use your vast knowledge to handle compliance on your own and keep the accounts clean and well managed. You can go into any field from CA.There's as much scope in CA as there is in anything else.",0 followers,Priyan Bopitiya,4.7K,269,7.2M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-do-you-think-the-next-generation-of-learning-through-technology-would-be-like

And that’s no exaggeration, viable quantum computers will literally be millions of times more potent at certain vital tasks.Quantum computing is not ready yet — it’s still in its infancy — but very serious progress is being now made. It’s advancing fast.At the same time, thousands more researchers are already making dramatic progress in artificial intelligence using recent breakthroughs in machine learning technology. Already AI can drive cars, recognize faces and diagnose medical conditions with astonishingly prescience.Artificial intelligence is also only in its childhood, but advancing very rapidly.So here’s the question…What happens when we combine the most potent AI techniques with quantum computers… what can we expect when we combine advanced machine learning with computers that are millions of times more powerful than the best we have today?The fact is, no one knows, but for the first time in technological history there is a very real chance that some sort of intelligence will emerge.It may not be independently creative like a human — or even much like a human at all — but it will certainly be able to out-think and out-plan us, able to play the game of life far better than we can.The Up Side…QI machines could be fantastically beneficial in more ways than we can count. We could ask them to work on humanity’s hardest problems and they may be able to come up with solutions no human ever though of, or even be capable of imagining.Or maybe we give the the toughest problems in mathematics and physics to solve, and maybe they can make breakthroughs all by themselves, things we can quickly put to good use.Perhaps we can even ask them to invent ever more potent generations of themselves.The convergence of AI with QC could dwarf any other technology development in human history. The possibilities are endless and the benefits could be huge.There is a down side, but it’s not what you think…Any reasonable person reading this must also ask, what happens if it goes wrong? Do we even understand what we’re doing here? It’s only natural to ask, how screwed are we if one of these things goes all psycho on us?Could it become Skynet and nuke us all? Will we see terminators ravaging the landscape? Could this lead us to a ‘rise of the machines’, completely out of control and bent on killing us?The answer is a resounding NO.You see, their very brilliance is what also makes quantum computers pathetically easy to kill… a single bullet penetrating the quantum isolation chamber will stop a QI in it’s tracks, stone cold dead. Permanently.Rogue machines aren’t a risk, instead the problem is with rogue people and nations, as usual.Quantum Wars…It’s easy to guess that the military of advanced nations like the USA, Russia, China, South Korea, Japan and members of the EU will be early and enthusiastic adopters of QI, once the money they are already pouring into research bears fruit.So the real threat isn’t a single Skynet-like machine going berserk, the danger is we get into a sort of quantumThat is what AI might be like 30 years from now.",17 followers,Fabius Fairchild,1.8K,0,0,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-is-going-to-be-the-next-big-technological-revolution-that-will-seem-mundane-in-10-years-time

So they licensed their own technology and built their individual trains.Over the decade from 2004 to 2014, the Chinese high-speed railway network runs a variety of trains from different companies.Here is the list:CRH1CRH1 was bought from Bombardier Regina series.The Regina series are commonly found from the trains in Europe. Their shapes are exactly the same.CRH2CRH2 was licensed from Kawasaki Heavy Industries (川崎重工業車両). The Japanese were too afraid of the Chinese copying their Shinkansen technology, so they chose an older version of Shinkansen E2-1000. This version is also called Yamabiko that runs on the JR-East railway network. Its speed is around 300km/h but the CRH2 speed was limited to 250km/h.The original Japanese E2 version:Yes, they are exactly the same because the Chinese bought from the Japanese. It is not stealing.On 23 July 2011, a CRH1 and CRH2 collided on a bridge that caused 40 deathsCRH3CRH3 was designed by Siemens in Germany and manufactured in China. The license is based on the Velaro series:Germany ICE:British Eurostar:Turkey TCDD:They are all the same train!CRH4There is no CRH4 because 4 is the unlucky number in China!CRH5CRH5 was designed by Alstom in France. And it is licensed based on theSee that? The Chinese people are actually enjoying trains from Canada, Japan, Germany, and France. We are not stealing technology. But we are buying them using real dollars!Stage II: Mimic your own through joint ventures ( 2008–2014)After trying out many different trains, the Chinese railway ministry selected the best performing train series and their corresponding companies. It then asked them to customize the train to meet the new demand:Japanese QuitHowever, the Japanese refused to provide a customized design for the 380km/h standard because they think the 380 technology was the key to their latest Shinkansen and it has to be firstly applied in Japan. Their current standard E7 or 700 still runs around 350km/h. Then they decided to withdraw further production and all subsequent cooperations with China.At the same time, the Chinese railway ministry also demanded new trains to be manufactured by joint-venture companies in China. This was also the reason why the Japanese chose to quit. But the Siemens and Bombardier agreed because most of their revenue is in China and they can’t lose a huge market of China.After forming joint venture companies with Siemens and Bombardier, those Chinese domestic companies are responsible for manufacturing a fraction of components as domestic alternatives. Through hybrid manufacturing, they can quietly learn and master most of the design and manufacturing processes.CRH380-A - First domestic DesignThe CRH380A development started in early 2008, originally assigned to the Japanese to design the new 380km/h train for the proposed Beijing-Shanghai high-speed railway. It was supposed to be the top brand of all. However, the Japanese decided to quit the project and they withdrew all the materials and key technologies to complete the project.However, the Chinese decided to continue the project regardless of the Japanese’s pullout. However, they faced a vast barrier because the Japanese only revealed the technology applicable for 250km/h. And the Chinese don’t even have access to the whole control system source code.To overcome the technology barrier, since late 2008, the Chinese railway ministry and ministry of science and technology established a special team called “Project 226”. The team was used to identify key technological problems from the gap. By using “communist administrative power”, the “Project 226” has organized talents from three domestic design firms: Qingdao Sifang, CRRC, and CR Tangshan, also 25 universities, 56 key laboratories and 500 OEMs in China. This includes over 500 researchers and 10000 engineers that contributed to this project.In 2010, the Chinese have successfully designed their own vehicle integration, aerodynamics topology, load-bearing system, dynamic transmission, and braking system, train control operating system, traction power supply, key materials, and components etc.Therefore, CRH380A was the first domestic design of the Chinese high-speed train. When it was released in 2010, the Japanese was so angry that they thought their technology was stolen by the Chinese. And the appearance of 380A was kind of similar to Shinkansen E2 series. What they didn’t understand is that if the technology was indeed stolen, how come the Chinese can improve the speed from 250km/h to 380km/h by themselves?CRH380-BCRH380-CCRH380-DStage III: Fully Domestic Design and Manufacture (2014–2018)After 15 years of cultivation of talents and technology accumulation, the Chinese are finally starting to innovate and build their own high-speed trains, although some parts of the train component still need to be imported.CRH6CRH6 is a new generation of regional/commuter high-speed train designed by CSR Qingdao Sifang Locomotive & Rolling Stock. This train is targeted for low speed intercity commuting around 200km/h.Fuxing“Fuxing” is the first ever train series that are seriously considered as a high-standard Chinese brand. Fuxing means “Great rejuvenation of the Chinese” so that it would carry the desire and wishes of the Chinese.Fuxing is designed and optimized based on the running data collected from 600,000-km of the existing high-speed train operations over the past 10 years, thanks to the large scale of Chinese railway networks, even Japan does not have this scale of data.On 15 July 2016, two Fuxing trains in opposite directions passed each other at 420 km/h (relative speed to one another of 840 km/h) during test runs on Zhengzhou–Xuzhou high-speed railway. Nowadays, Fuxing trains operate onOn 24th Dec 2018, the Christmas Eve, the CRRC just released four new types of Fuxing trains:Beijing Winter Olympic Express - Fuxing type not yet revealedAnd its interiors are the one of the best I’ve ever seenAnother new Fuxing train is the CR200J that runs up to 160km/h. This train will be very cheap to manufacture and it can also run on conventional railways.This train will be replacing all the old green carriage trains in China and it will run along the poor regions that do not yet have high-speed trains.From this:To this:In the future, we believe more and more types of domestic trains would be designed and manufactured. This has already created a lot of employment opportunities for the young Chinese. My younger brother majored in electrical engineering from one of the top universities in Beijing. He was just recruited as a graduate engineer in CRRC in Qingdao, which is the organization that designs and manufactures most of the bullet trains in China.And guess how many interview candidates were attending CRRC interviews in 2018 from his university?Every year, the CRRC has amassed hundreds of best talents from all over China. Those people are not only smart but also hard working. Considering so many talents in CRRC, we should not under-estimate the engineering and innovation from them in the future. The company represents the new high-level Made-in-China brand just like the DJI in drone area.Btw I’ve traveled many times to Japan. And I’ve bought the JR railway pass each time I traveled. And I also took the fastest Nozomi class from Hakata to Tokyo. Although the experience in Nozomi was pleasant especially with delicious bento, the train was shaking constantly when it enters in tunnels. In contrast, I felt that the experience in Fuxing was much smoother. Balancing a coin is not an issue.And also the total trip from Fukuoka to Tokyo is around 1069km and it took me 5 hours and cost me 23,000 yen ($210). In contrast, the distance from Beijing to Shanghai is 1318km and it took me 4 hours 18 minutes in Fuxing and cost me 550RMB ($80). Given the fact I’ve listed, I think the Japanese do need to face up to the fact that the Chinese have done better.Whether the Chinese steals from Japan or not, you can then make your judgment now.And thanks for reading this long post.","26,858 followers",Janus Dongye Qimeng,4.6K,0,0,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-do-you-think-the-next-generation-of-learning-through-technology-would-be-like
22,"The most different is the lead car.On the TGV, passengers never ride in the first car. This is because a large motor is loaded in the front of the train.On the Shinkansen, passengers can also ride in the first car. This is because the motors are distributed among several cars.Another major difference between the early TGV and Shinkansen trains was the presence of tunnels.The TGV was initially designed without the idea of traveling at high speed in tunnels.

Today's TGVs are designed to run at high speeds in tunnels, something that Japan's Shinkansen was predicated on from the start.Conversely, the TGV was designed to run at relatively low speeds on existing rail tracks, while the Japanese Shinkansen was not designed with this in mind at all. This is due to the fact that existing rail tracks in Japan were narrow gauge. Some of Japan's Shinkansen lines are now designed to pass through some conventional lines, but all corresponding tracks were redrawn to make this possible.",26 followers,Balaji Viswanathan,1.4K,5.6K,427M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-do-you-think-the-next-generation-of-learning-through-technology-would-be-like
