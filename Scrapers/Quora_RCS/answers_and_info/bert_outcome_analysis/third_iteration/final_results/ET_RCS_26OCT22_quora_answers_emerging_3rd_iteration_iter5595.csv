0,"The interpretation of the law doesn't change. The question becomes, ‚Äúdoes the law cover this new technology‚Äù and that question may have a simple answer - ‚Äúthe words of the law are wide enough to cover this situation‚Äù. If the courts decide that the words of the law are not wide enough to cover the situation, the remedy is getting the law changed by the legislature.",0 followers,Lucas Martin,6.4K,65,4.2M,2020,https://www.quora.com/How-are-the-statutes-we-follow-interpreted-and-addressed-when-it-comes-to-all-the-new-and-emerging-technologies-as-compared-to-when-the-statues-were-written-and-the-present-time

We don‚Äôt know what will happen, but the pig was genetically modified in a way that makes it unlikely the organ will be rejected by the recepient and pig organs in general are quite similar to our own.I hope the recipient lives a rich full life with his new heart of a pig.

Even if not, this is still a major step forward towards generating organs to order, without fear of rejection. Even if the heart is rejected and the donor dies, what we learn from the process will enable us to succeed the next time. I reckon this will become the mainstream way we get spare parts by the end of the decade in an optimistic scenario, by the end of the next decade in the pessimistic one.Either way, the moment is as groundbreaking as December 3rd, 1967, when the first human heart ever was transplanted, ushering the era of organ transplants of today. That patient died after 18 days, I hope this guy does better.","29,960 followers",Toma≈æ Vargazon,5.9K,7.7K,249.9M,2021,https://www.quora.com/How-are-the-statutes-we-follow-interpreted-and-addressed-when-it-comes-to-all-the-new-and-emerging-technologies-as-compared-to-when-the-statues-were-written-and-the-present-time

Sci-fi apocalyptic stereotypes met updated marketing hype. Case studies showed areas of concern such as biases with different sides taken on the parts of the dominant cultures. The topics of the TED Talks of those days became included in the introductory philosophical courses. There was criticism of the notion of a singularity and groups related to that have had to adapt. Big data led to analytics and doubts about privacy. The predictions that new platforms like Facebook would be leading in this field were right. Game champions felt anxiety. Techs sweated about image rec. Autonomous vehicles advanced. Digital assistants appeared in most places. The impact of automation demanded study.

7,"It is actually the same as the ongoing impacts of the past 300 years in the rise of the Industrial Revolution, a constant and expanding rise in equality and class upward mobility.Aside from the ecological issues that were the drawbacks, the breakdown of the aristocratic/serf identifications and economic constraints was clearly obvious.

Education was a necessary requirement to technology and was so promoted, but it also meant a rise in economic and intellectual awareness of exponentially expanding lower classes.The past 50 years has seen a rapid and clearly exponential rise of upwardly mobile people. The expansion of the ‚Äúmiddle class‚Äù, derisively regarded by Left intellectuals as the ‚Äúpetit-bourgeoisie‚Äù has risen from 3‚Äì5% in the beginning of the 19th Century, to a current level approaching 60%. This is now clearly apparent in East Asian nations like China as well as already established in Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and now Vietnam, Malaysia, and Indonesia.The expansion of technology in the world is fueling a massive increase in education, class rise, individual options and emancipations. The dynastic power of old money families is now being overwhelmed by new money families and individuals. Of the 25 richest individuals in the world, about 21 came out of the middle class or even abject poverty, a rise in wealth and class that has never before been seen in history. All of these new super-wealthy arose with utilization of new technologies.","246,860 followers",Dushka Zapata,1.5K,8.5K,232.5M,2021,https://www.quora.com/How-are-the-statutes-we-follow-interpreted-and-addressed-when-it-comes-to-all-the-new-and-emerging-technologies-as-compared-to-when-the-statues-were-written-and-the-present-time
8,"The obvious impact is the tendency to laziness because of the new technologies.
