6,"LIDAR is a dead-end technology for autonomous driving.BACKGROUND:LIDAR tells you the distance to every point within some region. But it ONLY tells you the distance.So if you look at a speed limit sign using LIDAR, you see a blank circle on a pole…you can’t tell what the numbers say. LIDAR can’t tell the difference between a red traffic light or a green one.Because LIDAR depends on IR light reflections - it doesn’t work well on shiny surfaces (like cars, for example!) It produces artifacts like RADAR suffers from when (for example) you get a double-reflection from an interior corner.To make LIDLIDAR is a dead-end technology for autonomous driving.BACKGROUND:LIDAR tells you the distance to every point within some region.

It produces artifacts like RADAR suffers from when (for example) you get a double-reflection from an interior corner.To make LIDAR work - you have to send out laser pulses into the world. What happens when 100 cars in your field of view are ALL using LIDAR. A hundred lasers - all scanning the world - shining light into each other’s sensors.There are only four options here: LIDAR-only, Cameras-only, Both, Neither.CONCLUSION: Logically then we DEFINITELY need cameras and we MIGHT need LIDAR.SO DO WE NEED LIDAR?We know - for 100% certain - that it’s possible to drive a car using just two cameras - humans do this every day. If we put cameras pointing out in every direction from the car (as Tesla do) - then you don’t have to (slowly) turn your head to look left and right at a junction…and with JUST Cameras - we get better vision than humans have.It turns out that extracting 3D data from cameras is ridiculously easy - I’ve written software to do that in a day! Identify some key pattern of pixels on the image taken from one camera (an edge or a corner perhaps) - look for a similar pattern in nearly the same place on the image from the other camera - measure how far apart they are in the image - and with simple high-school geometry - you can figure the range.Find ALL of the interesting features in the image - look for copies of them in the other image - calculate all of the distances and crunch the numbers - and what you get is a 3D image just like a LIDAR image.AI can learn the skill easily…and you can see from the display of every Tesla car that it can clearly see road markings, traffic signs, other vehicles, pedestrians, trash cans, traffic cones and so forth.TESLA have amply proven that you can drive a car without LIDAR - watch any of the FSD(beta) videos and you can see that the cars are driving just fine without LIDAR. I’ve driven 10’s of thousands of miles using FSD on freeways - and the cameras always get the positions of other things on the road just perfectly.TESLA’S EXPERIENCE WITH RADAR:Older Teslas like mine have a RADAR sensor - looking forward. It works just like LiDAR.Tesla found that by turning off the RADAR - ignoring it - they could get BETTER results than with it?!? The problem being that sometimes RADAR and Cameras disagreed about what they were seeing - and the Cameras were always right. So getting rid of the RADAR actually IMPROVED the cars ability to drive! Essentially, if RADAR and vision agree - you didn’t need RADAR. If RADAR and vision agree - and you know vision is more accurate - you ignore RADAR - and now you don’t need it anymore. Same argument applies to having both LIDAR and cameras.IS THERE ANY TIME WHEN CAMERAS CAN’T REPLACE LIDAR?Yes. Cameras need two images to get range (well, naively) - and if you’re so close to something that it’s only visible with one of your many cameras - then you can’t get a range and that’s a problem.It only really happens on Tesla’s tor objects within a few feet of the edge of the car - in that case, Tesla’s do have SONAR sensors that are used for objects that are within just a few feet. LIDAR wouldn’t have been able to see down their either.CONCLUSION:Because you don’t NEED Lidar (and evidently you don’t) - then it’s bad to include it. It makes the car worse.",3 followers,Steve Baker,575,27.4K,163.3M,2022,https://www.quora.com/Which-emerging-technology-will-become-important

This is because it's reasonable to work on the basis if you were born in 1990 you would not be due to checkout until around 2075 so now factor in technological progress and I think it's reasonable to assume millennials will likely have the option to live a very, very long time by current standards because they won't even be getting particularly old until around mid century. Now factor in that aging is pretty much the same as beating any other disease, albeit aging is a complex issue involving many different processes but that does not mean that it is not a realistic goal to render it a chronic albeit manageable condition within a 15/25 year timeframe and millennials will still be relatively young by then so they should be home and dry.I am frequently asked the question ""how long before we can cure aging?"" To understand this let’s keep in mind that we are already adding two months to life expectancy every year (or 5 hours per day) and this has been consistent for the last 30 years or so. If you then consider that many people including myself see a better than 50% chance of controlling aging within 15/25 years the whole issue starts to become very interesting. As far as the time span for an actual cure, I would hazard a guess that it's at least 100 years away because our understanding of how the body functions is very weak when it comes to metabolism but this is not to say life extension is not within reach over the next two or three decades. The alternative approach is to aim at controlling aging and repairing the accumulated damage and this should be our primary goal because we understand how the damage is laid down even though we understand very little about actually slowing aging or influencing metabolism as I mentioned above. This is the essence of Aubrey de Grey's SENS (1) theory regarding the engineering approach and this clearly holds the best prospect of success in the first half of this century and some of the components of SENS are already at a point where we have proof of concept (4). Having said that two other well funded organizations are waging war on aging so when you factor those two into the equation things look very positive, the first company is Calico (2) which is an independent R&D biotech company established in 2013 by Google Inc. and Arthur D. Levinson and the other is Human Longevity Inc (3) these two show the field is attracting serious funding and these will be followed by numerous others big and small so we are at the beginning of a serious push being made to tackle the problem which aging poses to everyone currently alive.My personal belief is that the birth year which is crucial is 1980 so millennials are in a strong position, my partner who is 20 years younger than me and was born in 1980 making her one of the oldest millennials and putting here in a vastly better position than myself who was born in the early 60's. The reason I see 1980 as crucial is because most of the people born then still have 45 to 50 years to run which takes us well into the second half of the 21st century so it goes without saying the younger you are the better the chance. I think that the technology by then is is going to be adequate to add - at the very minimum - 25/30 years of life but frankly I think we will reach that point before the middle of the century and in the second half will achieve the same again.Understanding how all this works is a little bit complicated but if you bear with me I'll explain though it's a bit of a head spinner, let's assume you are 60 years old at the time of the first effective anti-aging therapy arrives and that this early and fundamentally imperfect treatment repairs 25 years of accumulated damage. Then 10 years later you would reach the chronological age of 70 but would be biologically only 45 years old. We now come to the vital key to the whole theory which is this, let us say 20 years after the first treatment, when you are chronologically 80 but biologically 55 years old, both your doctor and yourself will realize that the damage that was not repaired in the first treatment combined with further damage accumulated over the 20 years since is again posing a health risk at this point it is time for another intervention. It is now that the advanced in medicine over the intervening 20 years come into play because anti-aging medicine will have moved on significantly and, whilst the first treatment bought you an extra 20 or 30 years by repairing a fair amount of the damage accumulated over 60 years of living, it did not repair it all, 20 years later progress will mean that the latest treatment will not only repair all of the damage corrected by the first intervention but also some of the damage that was not able to be repaired 20 years earlier so in essence you are now 80 and having intervention number 2 which will not only repair all of the damage that was repaired by intervention 1 (along with the 20 years of damage since the first intervention) but also some (but probably still not all) of the damage that could not be repaired by the first treatment. This means that, whilst you will have aged 20 years, chronologically you will be biologically younger after the second intervention than you were after the first. This is the essence of the SENS or the repair and maintenance approach theory, essentially, it is a shortcut to significant life extension. It is not a cure but it acknowledges that it does not need to be because it simply buys time and leads to a situation where regular interventions at say 15/20 year intervals with increasingly effective treatments could extend life virtually indefinitely so millennials are around 80/90% certain in my opinion to live to 150+ unlike myself in my 50's where it's a 50/50 chance.Of course the impact which the various technologies we ultimately use will have on radical life extension differs but there are six technologies in various stages of development today which in all probability will play a pivotal role, the crucial point is that only one or at most three (depending on which combination) of these technologies are required to achieve significant life extension but the six together will enable us to evolve and improve in ways we really can't begin to conceive from where we stand now. The key question in most people’s minds is is whether life extension is possible. My opinion is that our chances of success hinges on one key point which is that in order for our efforts to achieve life extension to fail then all of the technologies leading us down this patch which are listed below must also fail;Whole brain emulation and mindscaping - This is in effect mind transfer to a non biological host although it could equally apply to uploading the brain to a new biological brain created via tissue engineering this differs from point three in that the objective from the outset is to replicate the entire brain but has the drawback that if the original brain continues to exist the second brain would have a separate existence in other words whilst you are identical at the time of upload increasing divergence over time will be inevitable.I can't see them failing hence failure to achieve life extension will not happen because all these technologies (or the technologies leading to them) are progressing very rapidly, for this reason my guess is we will reach the stage of achieving a decisive level of medical control over the aging process within 15/25 years.So the answer to the question is if millennial's don't make it something would have to go very seriously wrong!The links below clearly support my own view that we are very much on course to be able to manage and control aging in the next two or three decades and maybe sooner.","24,004 followers",Shanks Wang,5.7K,183,13.3M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Which-emerging-technology-will-become-important

Not only is it a cause of suffering it is degrading to people who feel they are dependent on others for their basic day to day needs. I had an aunt who died at 85 a few years ago who started having falls, then she got trapped in the bath for 7 hours, after this she was OK for a few months then fell again and became hospitalized and was transferred to a nursing home where she could not deal with even her basic hygiene requirements. Mentally she was 100% competent right to the end so the question has to be asked can this be right when millions of old people are in this position and we are close to being able to intervene and do something about it? The answer to this is clearly we need to do what we can because sick elderly people are extremely costly to governments and obviously by extension tax payers and therefore keeping them active and well will be an extremely cost-effective route, not only that but many countries such as Japan which have a falling population and the number of people available for work is rapidly declining if you were fit and healthy for decades there would be no reason to retire. If people do not suffer the declining years of old age, healthcare and the economy will benefit very significantly from a situation where aging becomes a manageable condition.So in essence my answer to Gary is shoot much higher for a much bigger and more substantial outcome and let's aim to resolve the nightmare of aging without worrying about a month or two here and there.",7 followers,Chris Manning,1.7K,1.4K,3M,2013,https://www.quora.com/Why-is-the-Velodyne-Lidar-stock-so-low-right-now-Is-the-chance-so-low-that-LIDAR-technology-will-emerge-with-the-rise-of-the-autonomous-driving-market

You will be able to strap a CP onto your fridge and turn on the CP which will then lift the fridge so that you will be able to push the fridge around like a balloon. In space the CP will continually accelerate. That means that you will have gravity in the spacecraft while accelerating and then at the halfway point of the journey you turn around your spacecraft and re-engage the CP to slow dOne of the answers is, the Centrifugal Propeller (CP).

In space the CP will continually accelerate. That means that you will have gravity in the spacecraft while accelerating and then at the halfway point of the journey you turn around your spacecraft and re-engage the CP to slow down. Slowing down will give you gravity again in the spacecraft. So we eliminate problems associated with zero gravity in space travel. It means that we will have people leaving for day-shifts mining on the moon or asteroid belt, and then return home for supper on the same day. The CP will replace all rockets, jet engines, air and marine propellers, and many commercial lifting devices.","74,721 followers",Tiny Nair,727,689,28M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-new-types-of-businesses-will-emerge-if-blockchain-technology-is-widely-adopted
21,"NEW FORMS OF ENERGY.NEW FORMS OF ENERGY.The European ITER, as well as the joint Chinese-US Fusion projects will be the 5th generation. If achieved as working models, we see nearly unlimited energy possibilities. The reason this is so important is that with electricity going towards 1.5 cents per KwHr, and lower, the cost of electrolysis of water, then flash cooling the hydrogen, can make a gallon of liquid hydrogen feasibly as low as $1. Gasoline cannot compete with that cost-effectiveness. Retrofitted IC engines in cars, or more practically, fuel cell cars, will dominate vehicle transportation.It goes further; with very cheap electricity, 3D fabrication becomes common, the energy costs to set up warehouse tier farming, with 8–10 crop cycles per year (instead of the open field traditional farming), will guarantee no hunger, with low costs for vegetables and fruit. Cheap energy means smelting of steel and aluminum drops the costs of doing it, metal fabrications becomes very cheap.The real use of this emerging technology is when it is teamed with another emerging technology; Ion Propulsion Drive. The use of a Small Modular Reactor as the power source for this form of propulsion, that will likely make chemical rockets obsolete, will substantially speed up space transport. The current impetus for NASA to get into it is speeds of 500KpHr. A trip to the moon, with acceleration and deceleration will be about 3 hours, to Mars in 5 weeks. Investment banks in Luxembourg have already surpassed $10 billion in investments towards Near Earth Asteroid mining. A typical asteroid is estimated to hold at least $5 quadrillion in precious metals as well as iron ore. Other Small Modular Reactors would be used for extraction and smelting in space, avoiding the carbon footprint of doing it on Earth.This is a technology whose impacts and possibilities will expand exponentially.","358,971 followers",Sean Kernan,11.4K,5.6K,727M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Why-is-the-Velodyne-Lidar-stock-so-low-right-now-Is-the-chance-so-low-that-LIDAR-technology-will-emerge-with-the-rise-of-the-autonomous-driving-market
22,"Thinking machines will replace humans workers ...Jeff Ronne's answer to Is technology eliminating jobs at a faster rate than they are being created?Thinking machines will replace humans workers ...Jeff Ronne's answer to Is technology eliminating jobs at a faster rate than they are being created?Perfect is the enemy of goodThe future role for money, taxes and traditional jobs may likely not exist as we know it today.  These concepts are predicated on an economic system that will no longer likely exist.The transition to a jobless economy where only a small number of robot designers are gainfully employed could be extremely problematic.  Rising wealth inequality might be inevitable unless we abandon our 19th century economic concepts and move into the 22nd century economy.IN 1930, when the world was “suffering…from a bad attack of economic pessimism”, John Maynard Keynes wrote a broadly optimistic essay, “Economic Possibilities for our Grandchildren”. It imagined a middle way between revolution and stagnation that would leave the said grandchildren a great deal richer than their grandparents. But the path was not without dangers.For the most part, they did not. Nowadays, the majority of economists confidently wave such worries away. By raising productivity, they argue, any automation which economises on the use of labour will increase incomes. That will generate demand for new products and services, which will in turn create new jobs for displaced workers. To think otherwise has meant being tarred a Luddite—the name taken by 19th-century textile workers who smashed the machines taking their jobs.With the low-skilled workers far more numerous, at least to begin with, the lot of the average worker during the early part of this great industrial and social upheaval was not a happy one. As Mr Mokyr notes, “life did not improve all that much between 1750 and 1850.” For 60 years, from 1770 to 1830, growth in British wages, adjusted for inflation, was imperceptible because productivity growth was restricted to a few industries. Not until the late 19th century, when the gains had spread across the whole economy, did wages at last perform in line with productivity (see chart 1).But the “race” aspect of technological change means that such workers cannot rest on their pay packets. Firms are constantly experimenting with new technologies and production processes. Experimentation with different techniques and business models requires flexibility, which is one critical advantage of a human worker. Yet over time, as best practices are worked out and then codified, it becomes easier to break production down into routine components, then automate those components as technology allows.Such processes have steadily and relentlessly squeezed labour out of the manufacturing sector in most rich economies. The share of American employment in manufacturing has declined sharply since the 1950s, from almost 30% to less than 10%. At the same time, jobs in services soared, from less than 50% of employment to almost 70% (see chart 2). It was inevitable, therefore, that firms would start to apply the same experimentation and reorganisation to service industries.A startling progression of inventions seems to bear their thesis out. Ten years ago technologically minded economists pointed to driving cars in traffic as the sort of human accomplishment that computers were highly unlikely to master. Now Google cars are rolling round California driver-free no one doubts such mastery is possible, though the speed at which fully self-driving cars will come to market remains hard to guess.The machines are not just cleverer, they also have access to far more data. The combination of big data and smart machines will take over some occupations wholesale; in others it will allow firms to do more with fewer workers. Text-mining programs will displace professional jobs in legal services. Biopsies will be analysed more efficiently by image-processing software than lab technicians. Accountants may follow travel agents and tellers into the unemployment line as tax software improves. Machines are already turning basic sports results and financial data into good-enough news stories.There will still be jobs. Even Mr Frey and Mr Osborne, whose research speaks of 47% of job categories being open to automation within two decades, accept that some jobs—especially those currently associated with high levels of education and high wages—will survive (see table). Tyler Cowen, an economist at George Mason University and a much-read blogger, writes in his most recent book, “Average is Over”, that rich economies seem to be bifurcating into a small group of workers with skills highly complementary with machine intelligence, for whom he has high hopes, and the rest, for whom not so much.In a forthcoming book Thomas Piketty, an economist at the Paris School of Economics, argues along similar lines that America may be pioneering a hyper-unequal economic model in which a top 1% of capital-owners and “supermanagers” grab a growing share of national income and accumulate an increasing concentration of national wealth. The rise of the middle-class—a 20th-century innovation—was a hugely important political and social development across the world. The squeezing out of that class could generate a more antagonistic, unstable and potentially dangerous politics.The productivity gains from future automation will be real, even if they mostly accrue to the owners of the machines. Some will be spent on goods and services—golf instructors, household help and so on—and most of the rest invested in firms that are seeking to expand and presumably hire more labour. Though inequality could soar in such a world, unemployment would not necessarily spike. The current doldrum in wages may, like that of the early industrial era, be a temporary matter, with the good times about to roll (see chart 3).The machine stops","5,360 followers",Valerio Cietto,677,2.4K,9.1M,2015,https://www.quora.com/What-emerging-or-existing-medical-technologies-will-dramatically-improve-the-human-lifespan
