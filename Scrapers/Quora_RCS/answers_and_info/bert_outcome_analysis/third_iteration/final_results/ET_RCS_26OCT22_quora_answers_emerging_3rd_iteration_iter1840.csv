My mother was a single mom and had taught my little sister from a young age how to dial 911 in case there is ever an emergency needed. Mind you, my sister was very smart for a young child as was I. We both understood stuff like that. I guess you could say a child’s interpretation of an emergency may differ. My mother had put me to sleep in my crib and my sister to sleep in her bed.

I was just a baby and my sister was just 3 years old. My mother was a single mom and had taught my little sister from a young age how to dial 911 in case there is ever an emergency needed. Mind you, my sister was very smart for a young child as was I. We both understood stuff like that. I guess you could say a child’s interpretation of an emergency may differ. My mother had put me to sleep in my crib and my sister to sleep in her bed. My sister was a pretty decent fake-sleeper. This was the only time my mother could shower without having two worry about two children running around the house harming themselves without supervision. As my mother is in the shower, the police came banging on the door. My mom heard the sirens and yelling. She put on a robe and jumped out of the shower. The police yelled that they would break down the door if she did not open. My mother ran to the door and the police busted in and asked where the children were. My mother, terrified, pointed the police to our room. My mother recalls that she saw my sister pretending to sleep with one eye open. Once the police realized everything was fine, they said they received a 911 call from a young child calling for emergency help and because it was a young child, they had to come check to ensure everything was okay. Turned out my sister had called the police while my mother was showering and was telling the story of a cartoon we used to watch as kids and how one of the characters got injured and went to the hospital. Being 3 or less than 3, she didn’t exactly have the best speech. She dramatized the situation in a way that really got the police worried. Eventually, the police provided my mother with a playback of the call and it was just about the cutest thing ever. My little sister was going on and on about a cartoon animal being injured and then hung up the phone. My mother had the tape until not too long ago. My mother recalls it as one of the most alarming and funniest nights of her life. Both her and the police officers there were so amused by the whole scenario. That night she cuddled my sister so hard, warned her about the dangers of making non-emergency calls, buckled up both my sister and I in our car seats and took my sister out for ice cream (i was probably passed out sleeping in my car seat). My sister also remembers it just like it was yesterday.",817 followers,Janice Hall McKee,24.3K,172,1.4M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-will-be-the-benefits-and-will-response-time-be-enhanced-by-the-upcoming-technology-that-enables-Internet-911-calling

2,"One of the scariest calls I've answered actually came in on a non-emergency line.A Spanish-speaking woman called to report her husband had been causing problems in the home. He wasn't there, only she and the children, and the conversation proceeded calmly with the help of an interpreter.I had obtained her address and was asking a few other preliminary questions when suddenly I could hear a male voice shouting and several people screaming.

I heard the phone drop. I instructed my co-worker who was working on the main police channel to send the officers code 3 (lights and sirens) but the yelling and screaming seemed to go on and on in my ear. Suddenly a man picked up the phone and began speaking in Spanish. Through the interpreter he explained that everything was fine and there was no need to send the police. I began to question him about who he was and what had happened, hoping to keep the phone line open. Just then I heard the sounds of the officers bursting in ordering him down on the ground. Turns out he had broken in and repeatedly stabbed his wife with a knife in front of the children. Thankfully she survived.That call was later used as a training tool for classes dealing with domestic violence.EDIT: Thank you for the upvotes!",5 followers,Tristan Obrien,11.8K,215,19.8M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-will-be-the-benefits-and-will-response-time-be-enhanced-by-the-upcoming-technology-that-enables-Internet-911-calling
3,Id probably say implants and/or tech where you give away personal information all the time.Kids seem to be more in line with supplying and sharing a lot of what they do with each other through social media channels etc and I think we who are a bit older may have more concerns over integrity?
