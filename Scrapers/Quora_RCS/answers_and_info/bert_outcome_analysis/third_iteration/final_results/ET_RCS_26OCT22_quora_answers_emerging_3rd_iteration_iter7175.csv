We also briefly considered C#, Java, and Scala. The biggest issues with Python are speed and the lack of typechecking.C# seemed pretty promising. As a programming language, it's great, but:For a lot of little reasons, Java programs end up being longer and more painful to write than the equivalent Python programs. It's also harder to interoperate with non-Java stuff. Scala had a lot of the downsides of Java and the JVM, although it wasn't quite as bad. The language seemed a little too new and like it would bring some unnecessary risk (for example, who knows how good support will be in 10 years).Two other languages we very briefly thought about were OCaml and Haskell (neither had big enough ecosystems or good enough standard libraries, and both were potentially too hard for some designers/data analysts/non-engineers who might need to write code).We decided that Python was fast enough for most of what we need to do (since we push our performance-critical code to backend servers written in C++ whenever possible). As far as typechecking, we ended up writing very thorough unit tests which are worth writing anyway, and achieve most of the same goals. We also had a lot of confidence that Python would continue to evolve in a direction that would be good for the life of our codebase, having watched it evolve over the last 5 years.So far, we've been pretty happy with the choice. There's a small selection bias, but all of the early employees who'd been working with other languages in the past were happy to transition to Python, especially those coming from PHP. Since starting the following things have happened:Python 2.6 got to the point where enough of the libraries we used were compatible with it, and we made a very easy transition to it.All together, these give us confidence that the language and ecosystem is moving in a good direction.[1]Upvote4.5k","37,427 followers",Xavier Amatriain,629,297,8.4M,2014,https://www.quora.com/What-technology-was-used-to-build-Quora

As of 2015, machine learning approaches are used extensively in many different parts of the Quora product. Most of these applications were in place before I joined. However, we are constantly coming up with new approaches and making big improvements to the existing ones. It is important to note that all these improvements are first optimized and tested offline by using many different kinds of offline metrics but are always finally tested online through A/B testsOne of the reasons I was excited to join Quora as VP of Engineering was how important machine learning was for the company's success. As of 2015, machine learning approaches are used extensively in many different parts of the Quora product. Most of these applications were in place before I joined. However, we are constantly coming up with new approaches and making big improvements to the existing ones. It is important to note that all these improvements are first optimized and tested offline by using many different kinds of offline metrics but are always finally tested online through A/B tests.In the following paragraphs, I will describe some of the most important applications and techniques of ML at Quora as of 2015.RankingRanking is arguably one of the most important applications of machine learning on the Web. Companies ranging from very large to small have created business models around the ability to rank, for example, results to a query string. At Quora we use ranking algorithms in different contexts and with different purposes.One interesting example isThere are many different features that could go into determining the right order of the answers to a question. In order to determine that, we actually first need to determine what we at Quora define as a “good” answer. One good way to come up with that definition is to look atWe have many other applications of ranking at Quora, some of which might even go unnoticed. For example, the names that appear as having upvoted a given answer are also ranked in a way that we present at top the ones that we consider are most informative for that given question/answer. The same is true for those names that are suggested when presenting possible answerers to a particular question.Let's take a closer look at two particular instances of ranking ML algorithms: Search, and Personalized Ranking.Search algorithmsFor an application such as Quora, search algorithms can be seen as just another application of ranking. As a matter of fact, search can be decomposed into two different steps: textual matching + ranking. In the first step, documents (questions) that match the query entered in the search box in some way are returned. Those documents are then treated as candidates of the second step, which ranks those results in order to optimize something such as the probability of click.This second step is indeed another example of learning-to-rank application where many different features can be used. These features can go from simple textual features that were already used in the original textual matching step to others that relate to user actions, or object properties such as its popularity.Personalized RankingIn some situations such as the one outlined above, we might get by with a global optimal ranking for all users. In other words, we can assume that the order for most “helpful” answers to a given question is independent of the user who is reading the answer. That assumption clearly fails in many important cases though. One such very important case is the Quora Feed. The Quora Feed is basically the homepage that any user sees when logging into the product. In that page, we are trying to select and rank the most “interesting” stories for that given user at a given time (see example below). This is a prototypical example of personalized learning-to-rank, similar to what the Netflix homepage does with Movies and TV Shows.The Quora use-case though is a bit more challenging than the one of ranking movies and TV shows at Netflix. As a matter of fact, one could look at our use case as a combination of what Netflix, Facebook, and Google News need to do to optimize their personalized ranking. On the one hand, we want to ensure that stories that are ranked higher are topically relevant for the user. On the other hand, Quora also has explicit connections between users. Actions on your “social network” should also influence the ranking. Finally, stories at Quora might sometimes relate to ongoing trending events. Timeliness is another element that should affect the model's decision to promote or demote a story.Because of this, there are many different kinds of features that go into creating such a personalized rank at Quora. Let's list some of them:As a matter of fact, it is important to keep in mind that at Quora we are interested in both engaging users to read interesting content and at presenting questions the users can write interesting content for. So, we have to include features that refer both to the interestingness of the answers as well as the questions. To derive those features, we use information derived from the actions done by the user, author, and object (i.e. answer/question). Those actions are considered and aggregated at different temporal windows and fed into the ranking algorithm. There are actually many different derived features that go into our personalized feed model, and we are constantly experimenting with adding more.Another important consideration about our feed ranking application is that we need to be able to make it responsive to both user actions, impressions, and even trending events. We have an ever-growing collection of millions of questions and answers that we could not try to rank on real-time for a each user. In order to optimize the experience, we have implemented a multi-stage ranking solution where different candidates are selected and ranked in advanced before the final ranking is actually performed.RecommendationsThe personalized ranking described above is already a form of recommendation. A similar approach is used in different use cases. For example, the popular Quora email digest includes a collection of stories that have been selected and are recommended for you. This is a different learning-to-rank model that is optimized for a different objective function.Besides ranking algorithms, we have other personalized recommendations that appear in different parts of the product. For example, in different places, you will see recommendations of people or topics you should follow (see below).Related QuestionsAnother source of recommendations is giving users questions that are somewhat related to the current one.Related questions are determined by using another machine learned model that takes into account different features that include, for example, textual similarity, co-visit data, or other shared features such as topics. Other features related to the popularity or quality of the question are also taking into account. It is important to note that what makes a good “similar” recommendation is not only how similar that item is to the source but the “interestingness” of the target. As a matter of fact, one of the trickiest issues for any “related items” machine learned model is how to tradeoff similarity vs. other relevance elements.Related questions is a model that is particularly effective in creating engagement of logged out users when they visit the question page from an external search. That is one of the reasons why for now this recommendation model is unpersonalized.DuplicatesDuplicate questions is an extreme case of the related questions case described above. This is an issue for Quora because we want to make sure that all energies from users answering a particular question are shared and focused in the right place. It is also important to point users who have a question and want to add it to the site to pre-existing answers. Because of this, a lot of efforts go into detecting duplicate questions, especially at creation time.Our current solution is based on training a binary classifier trained with duplicate/non-duplicate labels. We use different kinds of signals that go from textual vector space models to usage-based features.User Trust/Expertise InferenceIn an application like Quora, it is important to understand how trustworthy a user is. As a matter of fact, we are not only interested in answering this question in an absolute way, but in relation to a given topic. A user might be very knowledgeable in some topics but not so much in others. At Quora we use ML techniques to infer user expertise. In order to train those models we have several important features. We not only know the answers a user has written in a given topic, but we also know the upvotes, downvotes, or views the user has received on those. We also know how many “endorsements” the user has on the given topic. Endorsements are an explicit acknowledgement on someone's expertise coming from other users.The other important thing to keep in mind is that trust/expertise propagates through the network and that should be taken into account by the algorithms. For example, if I receive an upvote from an expert on Machine Learning to an answer on Machine Learning, this should count more than an upvote from a random user with no expertise on that topic. The same goes for endorsements and other user-to-user features.Spam Detection and ModerationA site like Quora that prides itself on maintaining a high quality threshold on the content has to be very vigilant on attempts to game the system by introducing spam, malicious, or simply very low quality content. A pure manual model to review content does not scale. The way to approach the problem, you guessed it, is to use ML models to detect these issues.At Quora we have several models that detect different issues related to content quality. The output of those classifiers is in most cases not used directly to make a decision on the content but rather is used as a way to feed those questions/answers into moderation queues that are then manually reviewed.Content Creation PredictionA very important thing to keep in mind about Quora is the fact that we are optimizing many parts of the system not only to create an engaging experience for readers but also to maximize good quality and in-demand content being created. For this reason, we have a ML model that predicts the probability of a user writing an answer to a given question. This allows our system to prioritize those questions in different ways. One of them is the system's automatic A2A (Ask to Answer) that sends these questions to potential writers through notifications. Other ranking systems explained above will also use this predicted probability.ModelsQuora has tried many different models to address the different use cases described above. Sometimes we use open source implementations, but many others we end up implementing more efficient or flexible in-house versions.I won't go into the details of what model is used where, but here is a list of models that are used in different places of our system:ConclusionAs described above, Quora uses Machine Learning in many different ways. While we have already been able to get very important gains by using these ML approaches, we feel confident that there are many more gains to be had and we continue investing in new techniques. Besides, there are exciting new applications of ML in the near future that we are already starting to think about. These include areas such as ad ranking, machine translation, and other applications of NLP that will directly feed into new product features we plan on adding soon.",783 followers,Abhinav Garg,7.9K,0,0,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-technology-was-used-to-build-Quora

It is not a perfectly smooth path, there are surges, slows, and if you zoom into some sections it might more resemble a roller coaster, but overall the pattern is clear.This pattern continues with human civilization where we humans used the technology of language to begin building this tremendous body of knowledge outside of our individual selves where a great many individuals could contribute to making this vast body of human civilization knowledge far greater than any one human’s capabilities and then pass that knowledge from generation to generation, so that it grows even though individuals contributing to it die.It is not easy to judge how intelligence and technology are precisely advancing, so we tend to look for easy to measure things, like Moore’s Law, but the increasing of knowledge about how the existence we live in and the application of that knowledge is growing across a great many areas of fields, thus pretty much every possible field of knowledge which can be pushed forward is being pushed forward. Moreover, often as one field advances it contributes to the advances in other fields.Now, there are others who will disagree with me, but I believe science has already shown beyond reasonable doubt that all life is intelligent from at least viruses and upwards in complexity. I define the minimal requirement for a system of matter/energy to be intelligent as being capable of the following:Virus are capable of this as a swarm intelligence over time storing that knowledge within their genetic code, which means as they think and decide, they change their genetics and thus their intelligent decisions are evolving them. I have come to call this “This is why I begin the development of technology with the development of life on Earth.Just because the technology is not of human design should not matter. As life evolved it learned the hard way pieces of knowledge about how existence works around that life. That life then took that learned knowledge about how existence works and applied that knowledge in the ways that life intelligently decided to.Now, since humans began as something very primitive, probably a virus, probably the same virus as most or all of life on Earth, humans have evolved in complexity of intelligence though",1 follower,Sangram Sagar,6K,913,71.7M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-technology-was-used-to-build-Quora

What is more likely to survive a household with three adults and one child or a household with two aTechnology can come with wealth. Wealth (individual) is an issue for Africa. The countries are usually ethnically divided which makes it hard to work together. Corruption and ethnic politics are rampant.Also overpopulation is an issue. Africa has a young population relatively. Which means more young undeveloped bodies and minds who are dependent. This rapid increase in population means resources are spread thinner. Adding population means adding infants nobody is born a skilled competent adult. What is more likely to survive a household with three adults and one child or a household with two adults and eight children? Obviously the first even though the second has more population.The solution to technology is competence which comes from education and wealth which can be achieved by ignoring ethnic tribal divisions at least when is comes to business and the greater good and not having more children than one can feed. Think how wealthy Nigeria or Ethiopia would be with half of their current populations. Same for China and India. If some of these countries don’t figure out how to slow the growth they are doomed to collapse.,26 followers,Balaji Viswanathan,829,5.6K,427.2M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-technology-was-used-to-build-Quora

Today we present to you very advanced technologies.Modern science can not remanufactured feel thermocouple.Greek and Roman historians recorded the world. Archimedes built a thermal weapon to set fire to Roman warships during the siege of Zaragoza in 2012 BC and used it last Thursday to build this brilliant weapon. Highly polished, you treat mirrors in order to concentrate the energy of the sun on incoming enemy ships, causing them to shave. Many people have tried to rebuild this weapon in the modern era, but failed, including a program like Busters that tried to build it more than once without success. The Thermal emblem, also known as the Maria Thursday map, is considered a highly advanced technology of that era. Despite the simplicity of his idea, Theor engineers studied the properties of this concrete for its strength and longevity, but they came to the conclusion that its strength is mostly due to some different materials added by the pomegranate. To cement, including volcanic ash, limestone, yogurt, and even blood. Before the invention of the magnetic compass, ancient sailors had to find their way by means of solar clocks that illustrated time and direction by shining a shadow on the drum. Scientists and historians were always puzzled as to how 2000 was able to travel continuously in a straight line from Norway to Breeland Island and back again, but in the years 1990 and 48,an ancient artifact of Viking heritage was found. Amazingly, it is known as the Prince Tuk chair, but some old recordings have referred to it as the Magic Crystal as it operated even after sunset. Scientists believe that a type of crystal was added to the disk so that it could make patterns when exposed to dim light. Scientists tested this bulb and found that its results are comparable to modern magnetic connectors.The patient's glass is a type of glass that does not break at all, but only stems when it falls, and it can return to its original state again with ease. The invention of this glass was introduced during the reign of the Roman Emperor Tiberius, who caused the invention to be lost forever by executing the inventor of a bottle because he feared that his signal would destroy the Roman economy by devaluing precious metals and man could not remake this quality of glass again.Getting around in the evening. Call them, their ancestor was one of the most popular drugs in ancient Rome because it was one of the earliest methods of birth control in the Romans.This estate extracted certain Gent fruits from the fennel plant growing only along some of the shores of North Africa, and women drank the juice only once every few weeks in order to maintain a regular period of menstruation. Its use as a method of abortion in some cases, but the increased demand for it compared to its duration has led to an increase in its harvest. Scientists can study the exchange of a day due to its extinction with a keen desire to find out how effective it is compared to modern drugs, as well as why its effects persist for a long time.Greek fire was a fire weapon developed in the late seventh century before the Byzantine Empire used it in its naval wars. The Byzantines called Greek fire many names, such as sea fire and letters. Although it was not the first incendiary weapon, it was an overwhelming success, as it possessed some distinctive qualities, such as its ability to penetrate above water, its consistency in the fittest, and it was not extinguished. One knew at the time the components of these fires until the armies captured the liquid and the device that needed it couldn't be re-manufactured. The true recipe of Byzantine Iran was so secret that its ingredients are unknown to this day.Damask parties The damask trio was a very strong type of metal that was widely used in the Middle East six years ago and was mainly used in the manufacture of swords that were legendary for their high hardness and combustibility, in addition to their high sharpness. The reputation of damask steel and its wide fame led to many legends, such as its ability to responsibly cut guns or the blades of other swords. But the production of these swords gradually decreased.I ordered it knowing its components to adjust, but their attempt was unsuccessful as it only continued to approximate estimates about its components and the way it is manufactured.",UNKNOWN,Ernest W.

23,We have computers. Because we already had integrated circuits. Because we already had transistors. Because we already had vacuum tubes. Because we already had electronics. That’s one technological change backed by 4 earlier ones.Most things technology comes up with are developed from earlier science or technology. No one heated sand to the molten state the first time with the idea of launching an orbiting telescope.,22 followers,Spencer McDaniel,1.5K,2.1K,61.6M,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-technology-was-used-to-build-Quora

The progress isn’t always linear, the advances aren’t always unbroken - but over time, it all moves forward from ancient technology to what we currently use.Perhaps, someday in the distant future, someone will another post just like this comparing their highly advanced technologies of the future with our technologies today - that would be truly humbling.",720 followers,Sandip Bhatnagar,629,321,1.4M,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-technology-was-used-to-build-Quora
