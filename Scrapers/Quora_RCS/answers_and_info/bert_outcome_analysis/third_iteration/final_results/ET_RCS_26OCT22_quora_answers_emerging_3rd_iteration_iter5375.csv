0,"I think the answer is pretty clear because it has happened before, at least twice.200 years ago 97% of the American population was farmers. Now just 1% of the population grows enough food for the rest of us plus a lot of the rest of the world. This is because of automation through things like steel plows, tractors, harvesters, irrigation systems, fertilizers, pesticides, and improved seeds. This happened fairly quickly too. What happened?

Huge numbers of people left their farms and became factory workers, making steel, cars, wire, pipe, engines, pumps, etc. and becoming secretaries, telephone operators, miners, journalists, movie stunt men, landscapers, interior decorators, artists, musicians, telegraph operators, newspaper delivery guys, truck drivers, and a million other things that those farmers in 1800 could never have imagined.The same thing has happened in the past 50 years too. Back in the 1960’s there were huge numbers of secretaries, telephone operators, printing press operators, car mechanics, etc. doing jobs that are non-existent or a faint shadow of what they once were. They have been replaced with computers mostly but with other technologies too. What happened? They got new jobs as webmasters, baristas, YouTube performers, yoga trainers, network installers, sushi chefs, search engine optimization experts, topiary artists, and another million things that could not have been predicted in 1960.I can’t tell you what the big new employment opportunities there will be in 50 years any more than my grandfather in 1960 could tell that his grandson would be building computer simulations of cargo terminals, but there’s always plenty to do out there to make the world a better place.But for a moment let’s consider what would happen if literally every useful thing that could make our lives better were to suddenly just happen without any need for our lifting a finger. You want dinner? Boom, the best food any time you want it. You want a better house with a beach view? Boom. You feeling lonely? Boom! Instant girlfriend! Feeling bored? Boom a perfect adventure! Want to see a movie better than anything from Hollywood today (a low bar these days, I know)? Boom! You want a star ship to explore the galaxy in? Boom. That isn’t possible of course, but if it were, you are right that there wouldn’t be an economy anymore, but why would we need one? Everything you could ever want is just instantly provided for you. The problem in that world is not economic collapse but how to not turn into the Eloi from The Time Machine or the fat people on scooters from the space ship in Wall-E. But that’s not an economic problem, it is a social, psychological, and motivational problem.",UNKNOWN,Ben Y.

1,"Centuries. The error here is to believe that labour is somehow “special” and demand is finite.Let me explain as a headhunter why people are hired and fired.Take pizzas as an example. A pizza has about 75% of its cost in labour in various ways, delivery, taking your order, making it, cleaning the kitchen, etc.I’m guessing 1/3 of the labour is delivery, 25% of the cost of your pizza.So let’s imagine a delivery robot reduces that to 5%.It’s not zero and that’s an important point,SCenturies.

Those who believe automation will kill all jobs believe that will go in profit to companies and in the short term they are right. But anyone can buy a delivery robot so soon everyone will have one.So one pizza chain decides to get market share by cutting prices by 15%. it sells aSo pizza prices go down across the board.So we eat more pizza and here we hit a key point in economics calledFor many things a drop in price of X% causes demand to go up by more than X% and that is certainly true of pizzas. This means that there will be more work for the other 2/3 of the labour that isn’t delivery. Not just in the kitchen, but making the ingredients, marketing the chain etc.There is now also new work, in the form of making and maintaining robots.And yes we all get a bit fatter.There is no difference between the labour part of the cost being reduced and the cost of toppings like cheese going down, in fact this is happening as people take up vegetarian and vegan diets where supermarkets and restaurants have discovered they can sell plants for the same cost as meat.You might say the demand for food is finite even if you make it cheaper and I would agree, but the demand for the labour to make it is not so bounded as we see with vegan, vegetarian, gluten free, low salt, high fibre, low calorie nut free, egg free, kosher, halal, fresh, pre-made and all the other ways we get picky about food once we get beyondAs its lockdown, my PC is helping to warm the house and since I’m a geek, it’s a rather meatier machine so warms more. The energy per instruction executed is much lower than 10 or 20 years ago, but the primary purpose of my PC like human labour is to do some task. Yes, it’s helpful to warm my house in January, but liker employing people, using electricity is a means to an end.You employ more labour or less if that suits your business needs, same with power and a more efficient use of electricity means I am more likely to use it. Same iwthn labour, automation is simply an increase in productivity.Not all goods show the price elasticity of pizza. Washing powder for instance, a decrease in price would increase demand a little but ultimately there is a finite demand to wash clothes.Why am I so confident ?Because it has happened again and again, many times for centuries.My sister trained as a copy typist, a job so bizarre that I need to explain it to people under 50.Before word processors, if you wanted to change the wordYepThe wordThese were not obscure niche jobs, this sort of work was a large % of all office labour they were literally calledYet today, more people and as in my examples more women are employed in offices than ever before, OK I’m writing this during the pandemic, but that just means they do it at home.Manufacturing has been decreasing the number of worked hours to make goods cheaper. As (for instance) clothes have got cheaper we consume more of them.Let’s be clear here. A company buys a robot to reduce the cost of doing things. some of course will misjudge this, but in the main more automation means the cost of goods and services go down so we consume more.But can demand be filled as in my example of washing powder ?For some things yes, but let us look at the largest scale problems as terms for demand.Housing, go look at the % of people who don’t have a decent, safe warm and dry place to live and that’s aWhich leads us to think of the effort in decarbonisation the economy on a global scale. Even if you don’t believe in climate change we are rapidly running out of fossils fuels, that’s a vast, huge amount of demand...which we won’t get to in time to stop all the effects of water rising etc so dealing with that is big.Then there’s getting everyone enough food of a decent quality.Then there’s healthcare, which will suck in any amount of labour. Let us imagine that productivity of all medical staff doubles, reckon that will saturate demand ? Or a factor of 10 ?And since we’re making people live longer through better healthcare, diet, living conditions , etc so they will consume more and of course need care when they get old.I’ve not even started on new types of products, which I cannot beieve you have have not noticed.And finally mass customisation, not long from now people will think it barbaric that shoes weren’t made for your individual feet, ditto chairs, clothes etc.So as a small example for my wife's last birthday I had a cake made where I could upload a picture and it would be printed in icing on top. A highly automated process,Earlier I mentioned how as we are more able to afford food we get more picky. It is really not all that hard, (just expensive) for food to be made that suitsThat's what rich people get now, it’s coming to you courtesy of automation. But will require programmers, people who understand nutrition (no not Gwyneth Paltro or other celeb) and the logistics are deliciously complex.But my favourite new job are the people at Microsoft whose job is to train people to watch porn more effectively. They already have professional porn watchers (yes, that’s a job) because Microsoft routinely rummages through your stuff you’ve stored on its Cloud, looking for things that might affect it commercially as well videos that may be illegal.Turns out that despite not able to build a competent search engine, the company that booby trapped Windows to suck you into using Bing (named after the most clueless member of the Friends cast being an aspirational figure for Bing developers), managed to find a whole pile of truly scary stuff.So bad, that the staff sued Microsoft claiming they had PTSD and weren’t trained to cope, so MS now has to care for its porn watchers.Microsoft sued by staff traumatized by child sex abuse vids stashed on OneDrive accountsThat horrible example illustrates that there will be many types of new jobs, some will be bad like watching sick videos or cleaning the nozzles of 3D printers (done that, bad), some will be much the same switching from fixing cars to fixing delivery robots, some like my plumber who drivers a Porsche whose work includes dealing with Google home automation.","90,368 followers",Alisha Talks,21.9K,910,103.9M,2021,https://www.quora.com/In-the-future-when-most-of-the-old-jobs-have-been-automated-by-new-technology-what-new-jobs-for-humanity-will-emerge

3,"I feel compelled to answer this question, because I disagree with most of the answers here.The common answer here seems to be: yes it will kill jobs, but only the jobs low on the food chain, and it will create more jobs to at least offset the jobs it does kill.I disagree. I think AI will kill jobs, and over time, AI might kill most “jobs” as we know them.

I think AI will kill jobs, and over time, AI might kill most “jobs” as we know them. I think that people are somewhat complacent in regard to the economic impact of AI, and will likely be ill-prepared for the changes we have to adapt to in the not-so-distant future.First, let's start with the comparisons to machinery and automation. They did indeed put factory workers out of work. In that respect, I agree AI today is similar in many applications, replacing workers who have less specialized skills, perhaps call center operators, office assistants (in a limited extent), and maybe soon, taxi drivers and truck drivers. But I would argue that AI is fundamentally different from machinery or most of the other analogies commonly made when answering this question, because AI is growing and is unlikely to stop growing. It's growing in breadth (of applications and industries), in geographic and economic scope, and in power (it's capacity to address increasingly complex tasks). A more fitting analogy would be machinery in an automobile plant that not only made the parts one day, but then learned how to assemble them the week after, and then how to design cars a year later.I think that there is little that is out of reach for advanced AI of the future. Let's leave the question of the AI singularity alone for now. Instead, I think that deep learning efforts at Google and elsewhere are making AI systems learn faster and faster, with a growing rate of acceleration. Advanced AI can now address increasingly complex tasks including medical diagnosis, stock market trading, weather prediction and human behavioral modeling. Very soon, it will be able to take the place of certain types of teachers, and find a role in education. It can already deal with complex systems in software and mathematics, and seems to be only limited in applications that require interactions with the physical world (sensors are still imperfect), and with people.So without projecting too far into the future, we can ask the question, what jobs will NOT be killed by AI? Jobs that involve labor are already (or soon to be) replaced. Jobs that require logical reasoning are being replaced, albeit at a slower rate. What are the qualities that humans have that cannot be captured by AI? Perhaps creativity, emotional responses? So perhaps researchers in academia will survive longer than most, and artists (though AI stylistic mimicry is already quite impressive and their results enjoyable), and counselors/psychologists/case workers, and decision makers like CEOs who cannot be predictable or error prone. And hopefully software engineers and algorithm designers who develop AI systems.This leaves a very, very small portion of today's jobs intact. Many say: we just need to train people to fill higher level jobs created by AI, e.g. Programmers, ML researchers. But this is no easy feat. The US educational system is struggling to meet the demands created by advanced technology today. This failure is in part responsible for the economic divide plaguing the country today. The challenge of educating the public for a job market that is both decreasing in scope and increasing in complexity, is nothing we've ever faced before.I am far from original in this opinion. But if I had to guess, I would say that AI will put far more people out of work than we can (re)train in time. That will have significant economic repercussions as corporations seeking to minimize cost will do so at the cost of rising unemployment. There will need to be dramatic changes in social policies in order to avert large scale economic disaster, first dramatic rises in minimum wage, then eventually some type of universal income/welfare. It's the kind of change that requires significant leadership in our government, something that seems woefully absent today.",169 followers,Ian Mathews,500,106,13.4M,2017,https://www.quora.com/In-the-future-when-most-of-the-old-jobs-have-been-automated-by-new-technology-what-new-jobs-for-humanity-will-emerge
