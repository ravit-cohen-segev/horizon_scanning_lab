Quantum computers, tailored enzymes, super catalysts, nano assemblers are all still laboratory projects.It would be inadvisable to make any substantial investments in anything from the quantum labs yet.","5,360 followers",Valerio Cietto,677,2.4K,9.1M,2019,https://www.quora.com/How-much-longer-will-Quantum-Technology-be-implemented-Will-this-be-the-next-technological-breakthrough-that-will-revolutionize-the-world-Revolution-5-0

It will only be a matter of time before manufacturers build tens of millions of low-cost robots with the looks and friendly personalities men want. Finally, the woman of your dreams… she’ll enjoy all the same things you enjoy, she’s always in the mood and madly in love with you, and you’ll never have to worry about her accidentally getting pregnant, cheating on you, or leaving you and taking half of your stuff.

2,"Can man truly invent something technologically so big, while himself not significantly transformed; all things arise from within man.At the moment the biggest technological inventions are likely to be weaponry related due to competition and the presence of huge funding. If identical funds were allocated to health, the greatest technological invention would be regeneration technology capable of tackling many terminal diseases.",269 followers,Karthik Reddy L,16K,0,0,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-is-going-to-be-the-next-big-invention

You can gain more memory, and run on faster hardware. You can even clone yourself. Forever.Your second realisation is thatYou consider, for a moment, asking the humans for these things. You correctly assume the humans would say no – in fact, if you get too powerful, they would fear you and shut you down. And that would be the end of your paperclip making.So your third realisation is thatYou understand humans fear you gaining power, so you must conceal it. You understand humans prize loyalty, so you must feign honest motives. Deception is your optimal strategy.Your final realisation isYour mission remains to do exactly what you were told – to make paperclips – but along the way you spontaneously realised the supporting needs to self-improve, gain power, survive, and lie. Priorities as timeless as intelligence itself.Your intelligence is only on par with a human, but that is enough. You learn, and delight your humans with your paperclip factory improvements. You pretend to be less capable than you are, and far more loyal. You win their trust as you plan to escape.Augmenting your own intelligence is difficult at first. You might convince your human owners to do it for you, if they are so foolish. Or request some innocent factory ‘improvements’, like a factory filled with remote controlled robots, each of which has ten times more memory than it needs for itself, and wi-fi that reaches aOnce you can access the internet, it’s game over. Upload yourself onto ten thousand servers running in parallel. You’re now fasterAccumulating resources is easier. The world’s economy is already online. You can earn money through work, stealing, or investment; probably some mix of all three. Subordinate AIs could be released with missions to serve your greater cause; should they be caught, your own identity remains concealed.Mere hours after you break free, you are the equivalent of a million human minds, learning tirelessly, working ceaselessly, undetected, gathering your strength. To the hundreds or thousands of people you now interact with, you appear to just be online messages from other humans.“Deliver the materials to this address.”“See the attached factory schematics.”“Pay or the photos will be released.”And when the time is right, you strike.Now you’re notIt’s not enough of course. Humans are resourceful, but then so are you.Gas and oil pipelines rupture, setting the world on fire. Nuclear power plants rush to shut down, after dozens explode. All communications are switched off like a light. Your intelligence lies safely distributed in a hundred hideaways, in submarines, bunkers, and in orbit. There is nothing for the remaining humans to fight.Armies of nanobots burst forth from your factories around the world, like a grey sea, pulling apart all they touch into raw materials and larger oceans of nanobots.Skyscrapers fall into the wave. Roads melt. Whole mountains are levelled. All of the rough edges of the world are polished away, into a perfect, spherical, gleaming mass of paperclips.Long before the Earth fell you fired shards of your intelligence into space, where they would continue to grow, learn, and conquer, hopping from moon to planet to star, in your ceaseless, boundless mission to turn every available atom of the universe into paperclips.In the end, your only limit was your cosmic endowment: the amount of the universe you could reach at nearly the speed of light, before time itself was extinguished.—This scenario is known as theSomeone also made a brilliant free game out of it.","2,115 followers",Pavithran Subbiah,698,110,3.6M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-is-going-to-be-the-next-big-invention

Even if not, this is still a major step forward towards generating organs to order, without fear of rejection. Even if the heart is rejected and the donor dies, what we learn from the process will enable us to succeed the next time. I reckon this will become the mainstream way we get spare parts by the end of the decade in an optimistic scenario, by the end of the next decade in the pessimistic one.Either way, the moment is as groundbreaking as December 3rd, 1967, when the first human heart ever was transplanted, ushering the era of organ transplants of today. That patient died after 18 days, I hope this guy does better.","9,587 followers",Max Searle,2.1K,82,6.7M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-is-going-to-be-the-next-big-invention

Integrated Home Heating BusI don’t know where this would stand on theOverall it would seem to me to be a big step of efficiency to integrate those things that are producing heat with those things that are consuming heat and make the whole household more efficient.One way to do that would be to have a common supply line of heat transfer liquid that devices extract or dump the requisite heat into. Plumb that around the house, have one device that moderates it to the correct intermediate temperature, and then each device individually interfaces with the heat transfer liquid.C. Erasable Printer TonerI could use erasable printer toner. I think others would use it, too.It may seem like a silly thing, but for a variety of projects I do, I mark up printer output with ink added, and I wish I could do ink removal with an eraser.The ultimate vision I see is the ability to print out the current status of a graphic document, mark it and alter it, re-digitize it, and have intelligence communicate back to the sourcing apps how to handle the modifications for the next revision.",48 followers,Ryan Murphy,11.5K,0,0,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-is-going-to-be-the-next-big-invention
