4,"Take for example cleaning robot —It works well for fine particles. But what if there are exceptions??I don't think there would be any use.What if you employed a housekeeper??She can adapt to any situation, any requirements. Moreover she can learn overtime . She can do various tasks together.What do you think ? Who is more useful?When money is not the issue, but time is. Human beings always outsmart any technology or animals out there.Even in Industries , Huge changes are required when there need arises. It takes lot of Effort .In an interview with elon musk (with mkbhd) , Elon clearly stated tTake for example cleaning robot —It works well for fine particles.

Human beings always outsmart any technology or animals out there.Even in Industries , Huge changes are required when there need arises. It takes lot of Effort .In an interview with elon musk (with mkbhd) , Elon clearly stated that full Automation is not possible.Elon : “ I always like to automate things. But full automation is not possible. Semi- Automation is the way to go. Machines cannot adapt quickly .”He also stated clearly that when robots try to fix two houses , they take too much time finding and arranging them.Because it's not obvious for them. They are programmed to do step by step.A human being for example can quickly adapt and fix the hoses in seconds.Let's say if everything is automated.Who would fix the technical glitches?? Who would fix if rat chewed out some optical cables?What if there is hacking??There are so many things that can go wrong. Machines are not self conscious to realize that.While machines can do wonders, I am talking about automation which can replace human beings.It is simply just not possible.Unless you can create self aware robots, who can fix each other, like robot movie —For that it needs consciousness and subconsciousness.People say AI can do that.Yes, but AI can only adapt to situation in a fixed particular frame .The neural networks have to be trained !A chess AI cannot solve your household problems.on Scale from 1 to 100Current AI stage = 0.01Can they solve physics problems from scratch?? with derivation?? Nope! They can only follow a fixed pattern.While playing chess, what if their is powerloss? Would they realize that??Combine everything.Robot be like —Also, our brain doesn't work linearly. It jumps millions of times from one area to another.The amount of calculations and consciousness that our brain can handle is just unmatched.Compared to human beings, robots will always be toys.They will always replace repetitive tasks, not strategic or broad tasks .I will employ a robot if he can do standup comedy for me. ( not repetitive).~~~For those who think Quantum computers can do it.look at the size.How would you provide that much cooling, space, power supply to a robot.It may be possible via cloud computing, I am not sure about this.",36 followers,Adam Ambrozy,579,0,0,2021,https://www.quora.com/Are-there-any-alternative-technologies-developing-that-can-replace-Apache-Hadoop
5,"No, not for me. Everything I can think of that's alive prefers interactions with living things. Of it could replace humans, evil men would figure out how to leverage it.

6,"That’s a complicated question, in part because computer “intelligence” has a long way to go before it can be regarded as human in any real sense; in part because humans are pretty adaptive to whatever intelligence they perceive around them. The isolated character in Cast Away replaces human interaction with a volleyball (Wilson) with a face painted on it. Some men in Japan have found satisfying relationships with anatomically correct inflatable dolls. And, as is documented already in other answers here, some people have formed bonds with well made chat bots.The latter point is important becausThat’s a complicated question, in part because computer “intelligence” has a long way to go before it can be regarded as human in any real sense; in part because humans are pretty adaptive to whatever intelligence they perceive around them.

Some men in Japan have found satisfying relationships with anatomically correct inflatable dolls. And, as is documented already in other answers here, some people have formed bonds with well made chat bots.The latter point is important because there is growing evidence that computers do replace interaction for some people; most notably the old and the isolated, in much the same way pets do. That doesn’t make the computers “human” in any sense, but to the extent that a robot, whether in the form of a classic small robot, dog, or cat, can allow people to believe they have a companion, it’s a good thing. And if that interaction is with a program on their computer or tablet, that’s a good thing too.This doesn’t have to be about the Turing test. It can simply be about the Togetherness test.","90,361 followers",Alisha Talks,728,910,103.9M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Which-is-the-most-outdated-technology-that-is-being-used-on-a-mass-scale-and-can-be-easily-replaced
7,"Ultimately, I would say no however, depending on your life and the stages you may ind yourself in, there may be longer stretches of time where technology plays more of a part in your life or at least you get more screen time rather than less.I see technology playing a part in the changes and stages of our lives as a means to handle any number of things we need in our lives.Just think about the role technology plays since the COVID-19 pandemic hit.

For those of us in states with ‘stay at home’ mandates we are using technology more, not less for the everyday things like grocery delivery, paying the power bill, re-arranging everything else in our lives putting off all the daily things we had planned.How we end up using technology may be more utilitarian as the COVID_19 pandemic plays out. I am looking forward to more meaning in my relationships both professional and personal. I am hoping to be more organized with the mundane aspects of life and free up some space to learn new things discover new passions and build new stuff.Stay Safe.
