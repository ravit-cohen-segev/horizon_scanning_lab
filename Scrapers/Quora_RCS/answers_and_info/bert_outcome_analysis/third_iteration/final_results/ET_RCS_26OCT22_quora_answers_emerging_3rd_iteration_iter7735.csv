What we want is small and continuous - a plant that would fit on a city block or so and make power continuously for a year or more.The conditions at the center of the sun won’t do it for us. The energy density in the core of the sun is only about that of a good compost heap:So this is the challenge - reproduce the conditions of an H-bomb but do it continuously. In an H bomb we generate the conditions by setting off a fission bomb.In a reactor, we want to contain the energy generated by fusion such that the hydrogen stays hot enough to fuse. It is not enough to have fusion, the fusion itself must create the heat needed to keep the hydrogen hot enough to fuse - the reaction must be self sustaining. This is different than a H-bomb where happens so incredibly quickly that by the time that the hydrogen escapes, enough of it has already reacted.The leading candidates for confinement are inertial confinement and magnetic confinement.Inertial confinement is basically the H-bomb system but with the heating and compression of the fission bomb being replaced by lasers. We make pellets of deuterium and tritium. We feed them to a reaction chamber. We put very precise optics around the chamber somehow such that intense laser light compresses and ignites the pellet causing a miniature H bomb explosion. Most of the energy comes out in the form of 14.7 MeV neutrons which trash the apparatus over time but also are used to breed more tritium. Ultimately there are two big thresholds which are overall system energy breakeven - you have to generate enough heat to convert to electricity (something like 2/3rd’s of which is lost due to thermodynamic laws) to power the lasers.The second big threshold is that you have to make this into a power plant. Power plant concepts that we use now are very simple - boil water in a pot - and end up still producing a significant bill at the end of the month! Laser based inertial confinement seems extremely complicated and inherently expensive by comparison. Ultimately it is always about money (unless it is about physics). It is one thing to spend money on research and another to have to build and maintain plants each of which is ten times (or a hundred times???) more expensive than what we have now producing power.Magnetic confinement is more about physics, perhaps. Well, the current experimental tokamak facility being built, ITER, looks like it may reach 20 billion before completion, so maybe it is more about money! Note that this is not 20 billion for a power plant, this is just the proof of principle experiment - the proof that the physics can be licked. The argument is that if we make the experiment big enough, that that will be enough to fix the physics (plus it will take a lot of researchers through to their retirement age as we have been working on magnetic confinement for 50 years now).At any rate, the physics issues are perhaps radiation loss and instabilities. Confining the plasma, the very hot, ionized, hydrogen gas has been likened to confining jello with rubber bands - it always wants to squeeze out, it always wants to find a hole, or to make a hole.Radiation losses are that the magnetic confinement works because charged particles circle magnetic field lines. Circling particles are accelerating. Accelerating charges radiate energy. This energy is lost from the plasma cooling it (and the plasma is tenuous enough that making the reactor bigger doesn’t help this problem). The plasma is really hot, perhaps 800 million degrees centigrade such that the particles are moving really fast, such that they accelerate a lot, such that they radiate a lot. For DT fusion, most of the energy is in the neutron that is created which is all lost from the plasma. For other types of fusion, less (or no) energy is in produced neutrons, but these must be much hotter such that the radiation losses are greater. Beyond the first few easiest fusion reactions, the radiation losses are obviously prohibitive.",0 followers,Mohammad Jaafar,19.4K,2.2K,3.1M,2016,https://www.quora.com/If-fusion-is-possible-in-a-H-bomb-why-it-is-not-possible-in-a-fusion-reactor-or-a-fusion-power-plant
1,"We do fusion reactions regularly in laboratories. We can even do them on a desktop setup.

Alternately we can explode miniature (micro-sized) hydrogen bombs as is done in inertial fusion. So making fusion is rather easy. The hard challenge for fusion reactors are two-fold:1. Exceed break even point on Energy: In other words make more energy than the energy you use to start the reaction. Power reactors are meant to make energy not use them. So you need to exceed that point and that has been the difficult task with all magnetic confinement fusion schemes. The Tokamak research, for instance, started very promising but it proved very challenging to get the density and temperature combination that exceeds the breakeven point. The magnetic confinement method is just getting to that point this decade. The inertial fusion which uses lasers to implode a small pellet of DT exceeded breakeven point long ago but has a different challenge (see 2 below).","3,658 followers",Brent Oster,3.6K,357,1.8M,2016,https://www.quora.com/If-fusion-is-possible-in-a-H-bomb-why-it-is-not-possible-in-a-fusion-reactor-or-a-fusion-power-plant

They tried with the NIF, but instead of having a margin of performance of 2 (twice that necessary), it really had one of 0.3 or so. If they spent several more billion dollars on an even bigger system, they could make one that would probably work.National Ignition FacilityThe basic problem is that using magnetic fields for confinement is very, very hard; and the alternative, inertial confinement (as I said, the way H-bombs work) has problems scaling down to sufficiently small sizes. Many things are easy to make, if big, but hard to replicate in working form on a scale that is one million times smaller.But fusion power plants have a special problem, they not only have to work in a technical sense, they must be able to compete with other forms of power generation. Things look quite dismal here. The elaborate high tech equipment, the exotic materials, and the enormous scale a workable power plant seems to require makes it impossible to see how they could compete with renewable technology that exists now, much less the greatly improved technologies that we will have 50 years from now.","66,708 followers",Dima Vorobiev,1.8K,4.2K,139.1M,2016,https://www.quora.com/If-fusion-is-possible-in-a-H-bomb-why-it-is-not-possible-in-a-fusion-reactor-or-a-fusion-power-plant

Suffice it to say, with reasonable engineering choices, a fusion-electric hybrid car should be able to circle the globe several times on 2 grams of heavy water (or 0.4 grams of Deuterium).While there are undeniable problems (mostly shielding related) to fission and fusion powered mobile vehicles including cars and airplanes on earth, the situation could be different for vehicles used to explore the surface of planets in space. As mankind explores the outer solar system (Mars) there is a chance that nuclear powered vehicles could emerge.Fusion has many significant advantages for directly powering cars, planes, trains, and rockets to go to the stars.1) Fusion has no critical mass requirement, all that a fusion reaction requires is the right conditions be met (temperature, plasma density, and confinement time) to support fusion. As a result, very tiny fusion power plants can potentially be built.2) Fusion fuels are widely available in the universe. Hydrogen (and deuterium) is the most abundant element in the universe, fully 10^10 times more abundant than any combination of fission fuels.3) When fusion fails to work, it tends to just flame out, and serious accidents and melt downs do not tend to happen4) Fast Neutrons from fusion are somewhat easier and more cost effective to shield. than penetrating gamma rays from fission A combination of High-Z material like Bismuth loaded as a powder into light weight and economical Borated HDPE poly plastic is effective in stopping neutrons and is lighter than the lead required for gamma shielding of fission reactors. HDPE can be easily cast into whatever form desired forming shielding with no gaps providing excellent operator safety.5) At some time in the future it should be possible to use aneutronic fusion fuels like He3-He3 that produce no neutrons and release fusion energy into a combination of charged particles (protons) and heat. While He3 fusion fuel is rare on earth, it can be produced in large quantities relatively inexpensively in stationary D-D fusion commercial power reactors.While pure fusion experiments have so far not produced any net energy, impure fusion produced from fission-fusion assemblies works routinely (and has since 1952) producing fusion power on demand [3].Helium3-Helium3 fusionHe3 + He3-> He4 + 2 protons + 12.86 MeV (energy)He3-He3 fusion produces only charged protons and energy (no difficult to shield neutrons at all).Charged Protons produced from He3-He3 fusion can be collected on light weight grids and screens and used to directly power electric motors that actually drive the wheels of a nuclear car. Neutron less He3-He3 fusion does not require an expensive precision turbine-generator to convert nuclear heat into electricity (for He3-He3 fusion, lower cost and lighter weight direct collection of charged particles on grids suffices).Modern small pure He3-He3 inertial confinement fusion power plants in mobile applications like vehicles or tools could use periodic bursts of fusion energy to produce electricity through magneto-hydrodynamic power conversion (no moving parts - near 100% Carnot cycle energy conversion efficiency) to recharge batteries which propel the vehicle across the surface of a remote planet [2].Will there ever be a nuclear powered car?Perhaps not in the near term, but multi-axle all wheel drive exploratory vehicles helping transport astronauts on Mars powered by some form of nuclear fusion including pure aneutronic He3-He3 ICF fusion could be another matter.[1] - Y.

The developed engines, rovers, and aircraft will provide significant value on Mars at a development and delivery cost which is a minuscule fraction of the entire Mars exploration program cost. Without such equipment, long-range mobility for exploring Mars and for exploiting Martian resources would be extremely limited. The mobility limitations would either cause a large increase in Mars program costs, perhaps leading to early termination of a Mars program, or could even inhibit the first manned missions from occurring. To not undertake design and development of nuclear powered vehicles for Mars application would thus be “penny-wise but pound-foolish""’.(more information)A question for the quantitatively inclined nuclear advocate -D-D fusion is another very valuable fusion reaction. The primary disadvantage of D-D fusion for small mobile car operation is that it produces a very large number of neutrons which would have to be shielded to make operators piloting a vehicle safe [3].Q: So how much energy could 2 grams of deuterium produce if fully consumed in a D-D fusion reactor?A: 2 grams of Deuterium fully and efficiently consumed in a D-D fusion reactor would produce 2.30 x 10^6 MJ of energy.Fully burning a gallon of gasoline produces 136 MJ of energy.Burning 2 grams of Deuterium, costing $8.50 on eBay, produces the same amount of energy as would be produced by efficiently burning 16,900 gallons of gasoline.There are 34 grams of Deuterium in each cubic meter of sea water.Robert Steinhaus's answer to What's our current progress on nuclear fusion power and what problems remain ?Robert Steinhaus's answer to What is the smallest nuclear reactor ever built?

Instead of refueling it - you’d just take your car to the Ford dealer who would simply replace the entire reactor after some ungodly large number of miles.NASA came up with this nuclear powered Mars vehicle:Again, just a concept - but a reactor small enough to do the job is possible.Doing this on Mars is a better bet though - there is unlikely ever to be a collFord once thought so.

So if the reactor produces 3 kW, the car would be limited to a 9mph top speed!However, if the car still had a decent battery pack, the nuclear reactor could recharge it overnight by about 90 miles in 10 hours - which is enough for most people’s commute.Failing that - fitting 10 bowling balls into the trunk of the car would get you a 90mph car without needing batteries…and the reactors would last longer than the car itself, so it would never need refueling or recharging.[[UPDATE]] :But it would take 7 tonnes of fuel rods (which are insanely radioactive) to get enough Americium for ONE of those reactors. The cost of one would run into the billions of dollars range.CONCLUSION:It’s completely implausible to do this in practice.",3 followers,Steve Baker,6.5K,27.4K,163.4M,2020,https://www.quora.com/If-fusion-is-possible-in-a-H-bomb-why-it-is-not-possible-in-a-fusion-reactor-or-a-fusion-power-plant

18,"Unlike nuclear fission, fusion reactions do not release the majority of their energy as heat.Efficient conversion of fusion energy into electrical energy is more challenging and complex than in the case of converting fission nuclear energy where about 98% of energy released from nuclear fission is released as heat.In DT fusion, the fusion reaction most likely to first be harnessed to produce controlled release of fusion energy, 80% of the energy released goes into 14MeV neutrons and only the remaining 20% of energy released as alpha particles which can be readily absorbed in some medium to becUnlike nuclear fission, fusion reactions do not release the majority of their energy as heat.Efficient conversion of fusion energy into electrical energy is more challenging and complex than in the case of converting fission nuclear energy where about 98% of energy released from nuclear fission is released as heat.In DT fusion, the fusion reaction most likely to first be harnessed to produce controlled release of fusion energy, 80% of the energy released goes into 14MeV neutrons and only the remaining 20% of energy released as alpha particles which can be readily absorbed in some medium to become heat.D-D fusion of deuterium separated from sea water is not a fusion reaction that is considered to be practical in Magnetic Confinement Fusion devices intended to produce fusion with energy gain (more power from the fusion reactor than it takes to operate the fusion reactor). This is because D-D fusion reaction rates in MCF fusion devices we know how to build are too low to result in break-even energy with D-D fusion. The situation is different however with Inertial Confinement Fusion. Commercially significant D-D fusion in Inertial Confinement Fusion reactors using pure deuterium fuel separated from sea water is practical but energy conversion in this case is unfortunately somewhat complex, with about 66% of the energy release from D-D fusion being released as energetic neutrons.D-D Fusion of Deuterium fuel produces energy through four reactions:D + D -> He-3 + n + 3.268 MeVD + D -> T + p + 4.03 MeV(side chains)D + T -> He-4 + n + 17.588 MeVHe-3 + D -> He-4 + p + 18.34 MeVThe net effect of these four fusion reactions taken together is:6 D -> 2 He-4 + 2p + 2n + 43.243 MeVWhile 66% of the energy of D-D fusion is released in fusion neutrons, a significant amount of energy is also released in charged protons and alpha particles.Unlike the charged particles, the uncharged neutrons cannot be confined by a magnetic field, and for this reason cannot be easily used for a direct conversion into electric energy.Some first generation fusion power plant concepts have featured early power conversion designs that primarily use fusion heat to produce electricity and use the larger 80% fraction of fusion energy found in energetic neutrons to breed Tritium in a breeding blanket loaded with Lithium-6.It is possible to propose energy conversion systems for D-D fusion power plants that attempt to capture some of the energy released by D-D fusion fast neutrons and turn that energy into heat. For such a system, the neutrons have to be slowed down in some medium (like molten lithium), heating this medium to a temperature of less than 10^3K. The heat collected in the lithium blanket is then removed from this medium and is used to drive a turbine-generator. This conversion of nuclear into electric energy unfortunately has a Carnot efficiency of about 30%.Using a lithium blanket to capture a portion of the energy in fusion neutrons, which is 80% of the energy released from DT fusion and 66% of the energy released from D-D fusion , the energy conversion efficiency is low - no more than 24% over all. Further, liquid lithium metal is very flammable at temperature likely to exist in operating first generation fusion reactors. Use of hot molten lithium metal as a neutron absorber - coolant could compromise the intrinsic safety of first generation fusion reactors. We should be trying to engineer the safest commercial fusion reactors we know how to design. I believe it would be better to consider using a safer coolant such as molten salts in first generation fusion reactors. Molten salts cannot spontaneously burst into flame when coming into contact with air or water in a large accident while compromising overall fusion reactor safety.While this relatively low 24% conversion efficiency of fusion energy into electrical energy cannot be overcome in magnetic confinement reactors we currently know how to build,ICF fusion power plants (both DT and DD) can be accomplished higher energy conversion efficiency by surrounding the inertial confinement fusion target with a sufficiently thick layer of liquid hydrogen and a thin outer layer of boron, creating a hot plasma fire ball. The hydrogen layer must be chosen just thick and dense enough to be heated by the neutrons to 100,000 degrees K. The so generated, fully ionized, and rapidly expanding hydrogen fire ball can then drive a pulsed magnetohydrodynamic generator at an almost 100% Carnot efficiency [1].Magnetohydrodynamic Conversion of Fusion Energy into Electrical Energy -Electrostatic direct conversion -More advanced fusion reactions like p-B11 and He3-He3 that released a larger proportion of fusion energy as charged particles (protons and alpha particles) can use direct collection of charged particles working against magnetic or electrostatic field or directly collect particles on stationary screens to convert fusion energy charged particles into electrical energy at high efficiency[2].Electrostatic direct conversion uses a charged particles’ motion to make a voltage. This voltage drives electricity in a wire. This becomes the electrical power. It is normally thought of in reverse. Ordinarily, a voltage puts a particle in motion. Direct conversion does the opposite. It uses a particle's motion to produce a voltage. It has been described as a linear accelerator running backwards. An early supporter of this method was Richard F. Post at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. He proposed a way to capture the kinetic energy of charged particles as they were exhausted from a fusion reactor and convert this into voltage, which would drive current in a wire. Dr. Post helped developed the theoretical underpinnings of direct conversion, which was later demonstrated by Dr. William Barr and Dr.Ralph Moir at LLNL. They demonstrated a 48 percent energy capture efficiency on the Tandem Mirror Experiment in 1981. In subsequent decades, the efficiency of converting the energy in charged particles as are produced in advanced fusion reactions into electricity was demonstrated at efficiencies as high as 80%, which is about twice as high an efficiency as the best current thermal power plant turbine generators can demonstrate while converting heat into electricity.[1] -",2 followers,Richard Muller,1.7K,2.3K,202.4M,2021,https://www.quora.com/If-fusion-is-possible-in-a-H-bomb-why-it-is-not-possible-in-a-fusion-reactor-or-a-fusion-power-plant
