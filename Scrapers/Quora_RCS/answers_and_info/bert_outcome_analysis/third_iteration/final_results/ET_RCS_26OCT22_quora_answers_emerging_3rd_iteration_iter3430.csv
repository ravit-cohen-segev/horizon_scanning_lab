They are also involved in the management and development of Energy systems, including nuclear weapons research and nuclear power and management4)Rotary and Mission Systems - provides surface, air, and undersea systems mostly for the US, but also for some international customers. This includes their latest acquisition of Sikorsky Aircraft (maker of advanced helicopters, etc.)This should give you an overall sense of the scope of activities and influence they have. But there is much more in the way of “smaller” projects, such as developing package-sorting systems for the Post Office, Dead-Beat Dad tracking systems, highway/street monitoring and ticketing systems, fingerprint identification systems for the FBI, and large-scale IT systems and management, and much more.","68,792 followers",Kanthaswamy Balasubramaniam,898,17.3K,413.5M,2016,https://www.quora.com/What-kind-of-technology-is-developed-at-the-Lockheed-Martin-Advanced-Technology-Center-in-Palo-Alto

At the time of its loss in the shipwreck, the device was pretty old, believed to have been in use for at least 60 years. The device, made of brass, has a number of moving parts and dials like a clock that when operated would describe the motion of the planets and the moon on certain dates. It was made in Greece and uses a level of multiple technologies thought not possible at the time including precision metallurgy, screws, toothed gears, gradation of dials, precision metal construction and so on. It wouldn’t be until about 1453 that any comparable technology would be re-invented in the use of mechanical clocks and most of these were made out of carved wood because the precision metallurgy and construction needed to make them was rare or non-existent (John Harrison’s church clocks made in the 1700s were made entirely of wood including the self-lubricating lignum-vitae and still tell accurate time today).ElectroplatingWhile modern electroplating goes back to 1805 based on the 1799 invention of the voltaic pile, or “battery” as we call it today, it has been shown that it is possible that ancient Persians (today, Iranians) were using electroplating as early as 224 BC. The device has been shown in modern times on numerous occasions to be capable of electroplating objects if grape juice and a ground-up beetle were used to create a weak electric current. Although experiments have shown this to be possible, there are many missing elements that would have been needed including drawn copper or gold wire, insulators and connectors. So there is still some doubt about it as an electroplating machine. In addition, there are no known electroplated objects extant from that period so there is no product that demonstrates the machine was used or even possible. This information suggests the knowledge and use of electricity which wasn’t commonly known to exist until Ben Franklin proved it in 1752 showing that lightning was actually electricity. From there, a torrent of discoveries were made by Volta, Faraday and others.Stone ToolsStone tools were among the first man-made manufactured objects but it requires a loosely defined definition of “man”. Some of these tools go back to about 1.7 million years and some even further. One of the oldest is the Tanzanian Oldowan tool “industry” (in this use, the word “industry” has a different meaning than we use it on a regular basis). In addition, this was followed by the more complex Acheulean tool industry in France about the same time period. The ancients used stone tools for cutting, pounding and scraping and sought out particular types of stone for the way they broke at certain fracture points, one of the most desirable being obsidian, one of the most common being flint. Today, the sharpest blades in the world are still made of obsidian which can be sharpened to single molecule thickness on the edge.Of course everyone talks of Hero’s Aeliopile or early steam engines. These machines were for demonstration and never did any kind of useful work.There is an opposite and associated question, which technologies are NEWER than they appear and this is equally fascinating.People take for granted certain things such as the “chimney”. While the chimney seems pretty simple to us, the first use of residential chimneys wasn’t until a king in England put one in his castle in 1185 with a smoke hood to evacuate the smoke from his Great Room. Until then, large campfires were made right on the stone (or dirt) floor and the smoke escaped from the windows. It was a horrible price to pay for heat. Even then, residential chimneys in houses were not common until the 1600s. The Pilgrims coming to America had no chimneys in their homes - just a hole in the roof to allow smoke to escape. Certain laws were passed requiring “mud daubing” in homes to prevent sparks from setting the wood on fire. When the first chimney was invented, in the castle in Yorkshire it was the wonder of the age and people and scientists came from all over to investigate the modern invention and its obvious improvement over the current method of allowing the house to fill with smoke just to get heat. Note that building a chimney that drafts properly is not just a matter of stacking stone in a cylinder but requires other elements to make it work efficiently.Another more “modern” invention we take for granted today is the fireplace fire grate. This simple device was invented in 1678 in Germany by Prince Rupert and was a major step forward in heating. All at once, it lifted the fire off the floor and allowed enveloping ventilation that produced more fire, more heat, less smoke and more light. By the 1700s, this was still considered “advanced technology” but homes everywhere implemented all manner of fire grates and cranes and cooking implements to take advantage of the fire grate.Another technology that is much newer than most people think is the “fork”. While it was invented in Turkey in about 450 AD it was rarely used, thought to be an affectation of homosexuals and was banned by the church for awhile as blasphemy, since god gave us “fingers”. It was not until the world’s first tourist, an Englishman by the name Thomas Coryat who traveled Europe and wrote a “blog” of his adventures. He brought the fork to England in 1611 and after awhile it became the plaything of the elite, and each guest brought his own fork in a special box. In those days, forks had only two tines. The four-tine fork we know today did not come into common usage until the mid-1800s.","5,360 followers",Valerio Cietto,677,2.4K,9.1M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-kind-of-technology-is-developed-at-the-Lockheed-Martin-Advanced-Technology-Center-in-Palo-Alto

A much cheaper way to go is to start a website collecting writings on arcane and bizarre subjects, but you may have trouble getting permission from interesting authors. The really good authors want to be fairly presented. They don't want to be on a crappy site, and they might even want money for their work. At that point you would do better to have a product like a book instead of a website or museum, but even if it's sort of okay you may not be able to sell many copies unless you're already famous.In short, if someone's not doing it already, it might not be worth any money. Most of the time if it could have been collected into a book from popular sources, someone has already done something similar, like News of the Weird, and Ripley' s Believe it or Not.

18,"It hasn’t. But to people who can’t think for themselves. It might seem that way because the media has repeated is 1,000 times in the last 10 days. So stupid people believe what they hear several times on the raido, tv or social media.The truth is less than 10 days ago. In under 48 hours on their own Russia totally destroyed 1/3 of Ukraines total power infrastructure. They decimated it to such a degree and Ukraine is such an impotent and pathetic nation. Their most relevant city Kyiv is not forcing “rolling blackouts”. Keep in mind this was 10 days ago. Today more is shut off.It hasn’t. But to people who can’t think for themselves.

My government(USA) has given Ukraine well over $100,000,000,000 USD . They helped Ukraine plan one of the largest European counter offensives since WWII. My government gave Ukraine billions and billions of dollars.The 4 primary territories Russia has sought to keep, they absolutely kept. They recently annexed them.

20,"Easy. Ridiculously easy.Withdraw all Russian troops to internationally recognised Russian territory and cease all hostilities.No one will still want to trade with Russia, of course. They are inherently untrustworthy and the brand is totally toxic.

21,"Babushkas have already adopted to the new economic reality: selling canned cucumbers, tomatoes and cellophane-wrapped lard on the bridge in Central Moscow.The office of a car insurance branch was fully occupied but today there are cleared tables. At least 3/4 of the work force was dismissed.A National Guard with a Kalashnikov on the sling bought a McDonalds meal. There’ve never been armed national guards on the streets of Moscow.

French peculiar daring I remember from Jules Verne novels: let’s fly to the Moon and will figure out how to get back in the process. So I still heard French speech on Christie Prudi. And an English dad whose son James attends the same preschool as my daughter is still in MoscowGraffiti appeared overnight on the windows of food shops.Everything must go. Old sales price.Vandals wait for things to come to the head to get going. Police don’t arrive to a crime scene in good times. In bad times you’d need to pay them up front to do their work.Another business that went belly up. I’m on a popular shopping street in the center of Moscow, capital and richest city in Russia.Pac-Man ate it up.A line to a Raiffeisenbank ATM. A security guard warned there are no dollars or euros, only funny money. I said, I’ll have some rubble…rouble. He didn’t understand the joke.Russian athletes. They don’t need to have any signs in English anymore. Only in Russian and Chinese.My little side business where I have a 10% stake (and used to receive a salary instead of a cut from sales) is dead. A total disaster. No more purchases of colic relief drops. Russian women voted with their wombs.A sad looking man on the park bench. No support from government, community, the world.Migrant workers from Central Asia are still with us clearing a big pile of dense snow with shovels.My Netflix account is put on hold.A futile attempt to squeeze two magnets together. Same with Western values vs Russian values. They are at opposite magnetic poles.
