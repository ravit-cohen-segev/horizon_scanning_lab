Once destroyed you can take control of the airspace and offer close air support to your ground forces.In the 1st Iraq War (and 2nd Iraq War) the US demonstrated exceptionally SEAD capabilities.

Additionally, the US took minimal casualties.Let’s also put this into perspective. The Iraqi military had 3,700 SAMs and 7,000 anti-air guns. Ukraine by comparison has maybe 500 anti-air weapons.So no- if the US was invading Ukraine it would not be taking heavy losses. In fact Ukraine would likely have been defeated a week or 2 ago and the US would have lost like 200 men total.The Russian military costs 70 billion per year.

Enemy interceptor aircraft would be kept at bay using the powerful capabilities of the F-15.The enemy airforce would be largely destroyed on the ground and the operating bases put out of action.Once air supremacy is established US aircraft would use their superior standoff and high altitude precision strike capabilities to accurately strike military targets without having to come into range or descend to the altitude that puts them in harms way.Would there be losses? Yes, like there have been in any conflict the US has participated in.Why has Russia not done this? Lack of coordinated capabilities to do so so. Lack of precision weapons in great enough numbers and capability. Lack of training to employ such systems.","3,526 followers",Andy Durden,2.2K,2.2K,31.7M,2022,https://www.quora.com/Would-American-aircraft-suffer-the-same-losses-of-jets-and-helicopters-if-they-were-engaged-in-a-similar-conflict-such-as-Ukraine-and-Russia
2,"We don’t need to speculate when we’ve the Gulf War and subsequent Iraq War. In 1991 Iraq was one of the most heavily defended airspace with a large network of 200 Long and Short-range SAM batteries comprising of 3,600 SAMs, 478 Early Warning radars and 7,600 AAAs connected to a French IADS manned by 17,000 personnel. Iraqi Airforce had about 511 rotary-aircraft and 700 fixed-wing, including 37 Mig-29, 19 Mig-25, 174 Mig-21s and 88 Mirage F1.By comparison Ukraine had an Airforce of about 110 rotary-aircraft and 140 combat aircraft including roughly 70 Mig-29 and 32 Su-27.

Some rough estimates put Ukrainian Air Defences somewhere near ~430 SAMs without comparable central command network of Iraqi ADS. So Ukrainian Air Defences were roughly less than 1/4 the size of Iraqi ADS.Iraq wasn’t the greatest military but it was a major regional power that had invaded Kuwait and was capable of invading Saudi Arabia. It also had far more powerful offensive capability with a much larger experienced Airforce and a large stockpile of Scuds (Short-range ballistic missiles). In the Gulf War Iraq launched 140 Scuds at Saudi Arabia and Israel, by comparison Ukraine had only two attacks on Russian territory that destroyed a Su-30 and fuel depot.Despite having a much bigger & more experienced Airforce and Air Defence network Air Superiority was achieved over Iraq within theIn 1 month and 10 days the Coalition destroyed Iraqi Army, neutralised Iraq’s war-fighting capability and liberated Kuwait while suffering just 292 casualties. The US lost 27 fixed-wing aircraft in 60,000 combat sorties and 5 helicopters. The Coalition lost another 11 aircraft, 9 of them were RAF Tornados doing nap-of-the-earth penetration strikes (and thus, very vulnerable to AAAs). Desert Storm remains the largest and most successful air campaign in recent history. It is a textbook example of what a modern Air Campaign should be.In subsequent years Iraq slowly rebuilt its Air Defences, though nowhere near the pre-Gulf War level. During 2003 Iraq Invasion it had a little less than 380–485 SAMs, 6,000 AAAs and a limited Command control network along with ~7,000 MANPADs.In contrast, more than aIf you look at the recent attacks in Kyiv, Lviv, Mykolaiv and other major cities in Ukraine beyond Russian control, almost all have been from either cruise missiles or long-range rockets. Despite Russia intensifying its air campaign we continue to see it rely heavily on cruise missiles outside besieged cities. This significantly limits the scope of air strikes because cruise missiles are both expensive and limited.So far Oryx reports documented loss of 19 fixed-wing aircraft including 4 Su-30, 5 Su-34 and a Su-35, in addition to 28 rotary-aircraft including 7 Ka-52 and 2 Mi-28. The actual number of losses is likely much higher as Russian bombing campaign wouldn’t drastically stop for just 19 aircraft losses. With 200 to 300 sorties a day Russian Airforce would have made somewhere around 10,000 sorties so far.The problem isn’t with Russian aircraft losses, that was expected; the real problem is extent of Russian losses despite theirPart of this is because of difference in training and doctrine. An average pilot in USAF fly aroundThe US combat experience resulted in very different design choices. For example, the USAF/USN has dedicated SEAD platforms ranging from F-16CJ to E-18 Growlers. Russia in contrast not only lack a comparable dedicated EW platform but Russian avionics suite are nowhere as advanced as Western counterparts either. This is likely a reason for Russia extensively relying on Su-35 with Kh-31P for SEAD mission as it is the only aircraft close to a modern integrated EW suite. Putting anti-radiation missiles on an aircraft only solves half the problem – you also need a ESM suite capable of reliably tracking & geo-locating enemy radars with desired accuracy.The US also have an extensive array of air-launched weapons for SAM-hunting – from HARMs and decoys like MALD that can mimic anything from a F-16 to TLAM with the latest variants also having stand-in jamming capability to Low-Observable cruise missiles (JSOW, JASSAM). Some of the Russian counterparts are nowhere near as mature. Then there’s USAF fleet of Stealth aircraft which have been a key player in minimising losses. In the Gulf War F-117 made it possible to conduct air strikes in Baghdad during the initial days with minimum risk and was responsible for preventing quite a number of Coalition losses. Of the 3 F-16 losses in Desert Storm, 2 were in Baghdad on third night (Package Q Strike). Russian attempts at Stealth aircraft since 1990s have seen repeated failure.Russian military doctrine on the other hand focused on brute force of tactical ballistic missiles and cruise missiles. The Russian military launched 100 Iskander-M in the opening hours of this conflict and as of last month had launched somewhere around 1,200 cruise and ballistic missiles. This brute force was their counter to US/NATO Airpower and we see it spectacularly fail in Ukraine. Finally, Russia is decades behind the US in precision guided munitions (PGM). The US had 25 year head-start in PGMs as it started using PGMs since the Gulf War while Syria was the first time for Russia. The Russian PGMs are not only in very short-supply (they don’t exist in the export market) but are primitive compared to Western counterpart – KAB-500S-E has a flight ceiling of mereWe continue to see Russian attack-helicopters launch unguided-rockets over a ballistic trajectory to increase their range. They’ve to fly very low before climbing up to release their rockets – this makes them pretty vulnerable to MANPADs and even ATGMs. Just last week a Ka-52 was shot using an ATGM (Stugna-P).As a side note, Ukraine does have S-300PT/PS with about 90 km engagement range. They’re indeed more advanced than Iraqi SAMs. However, these are the very first S-300 versions dating back to 1978 and 1985. In 2022 they’re almost as old as SA-2 and SA-6 were in 1991. It’s also important to account the significant advancements made in SEAD technology over this period.In 1990s a SAM could easily evade HARMs by turning off their radar. This is not the case today with AGM-88E having terminal millimetre-radar seeker. It was much easier for mobile SAMs to hide 30 years ago with Synthetic Aperture Radars (SAR) having poor resolution and being incredibly rare on tactical platforms (only available on F-15E fleet). Today most Fighter-radars can create high-resolution SAR maps in real time and in some cases like F-35 and F-22 the SAR resolution is high enough for Autonomous Ground Target Identification. In other words, it’s a lot harder to hide SAMs in the bushes or in an urban area today than it was 30 years ago.","1,524 followers",Rodra Hascaryo,1K,1.2K,13.4M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Would-American-aircraft-suffer-the-same-losses-of-jets-and-helicopters-if-they-were-engaged-in-a-similar-conflict-such-as-Ukraine-and-Russia

6,"No. And unlike the other answers I’ll explain further. America has far more accurate weapons and stealth aircraft.The first things that would be hit by those would be the air defense network. Prior to hostilities any fixed radar or air defense or command and control would have been pinpointed by a jstar or rivet system. That stuff gets killed the first day by cruise missiles or bomb strikes from stealth aircraft or anti radiation missiles.From then on any strike would be proceeded and also include planes whose job it would be to suppress anti aircraft batteries.

In other words as soon as a Russian radar comes on it would get a missile coming it’s way.Satellites, drones, and signals intelligence would be looking for any surface to air missile sites without their radars on and they would be attacked. Communications systems to coordinate any attack between missiles and radar in different locations would be jammed and attacked.There would still be manpads and some organic air defense systems with frontline troops. However JDAM bombs, unlike the russian equivalents, can be dropped accurately from well outside the range of most of those systems. The ones that can reach altitude don’t appear to have good enough radar to determine stealth aircraft from other objects and again as soon as they turn on their radar to look they get attacked.Those advantages would also translate into very quickly clearing the skies of enemy aircraft.Iraq had a top of the line air defense system in 1991 and it was ground to dust in under a week. Aircraft were still lost but it was rare. Since then American attack capabilities have increased faster than Russian defense capabilities.It is functionally the equivalent of two people having a gun battle in a pitch black room but one having night vision goggles.

7,"I’ll do you one better - I’ll tell you who are going to be both the biggest winners and the biggest losers in my estimation.The biggest winners -The biggest losers -The is because I want you to understand how the increase in stock for the winners directly corresponds to a decrease in stock for the losers. Unlike global trade, geopolitics is by definitionI’ll do you one better - I’ll tell you who are going to be both the biggest winners and the biggest losers in my estimation.The biggest winners -The biggest losers -The is because I want you to understand how the increase in stock for the winners directly corresponds to a decrease in stock for the losers. Unlike global trade, geopolitics is by definitionA couple of caveats, as with any comprehensive analysis. Firstly, I’m not going to mention Ukraine, because it should be obvious that calling a nation a loser when it simply ceases to exist as a sovereign entity is a gross understatement.Secondly, I am talking here of the medium to the long term (5–20 years from now). As counterintuitive as it may seem, much like in meteorology, it is the immediate future which is harder to predict in geopolitics. Because the longer trajectory is determined by much bigger, structural and hard-to-change factors like population, resources, location, terrain, and political culture. I cannot predict what Sri Lanka or Argentina might do next week, next month or next year, but I can more accurately predict whether they will be a minor, major or global player in 10, 20 or 50 years from now.Now that that’s out of the way let’s begin with the three winners.W1. CHINAChina now has the chokehold over Russia’s economy and by extension, her geopolitical decisions.Thanks to her wanton and unprovoked aggression, Russia will be cut off ruthlessly and systematically from the global financial system, and in a double whammy, the EU over the next decade is going to moveThat means that for Russia their biggest customer in terms of exports - of energy, of food, of weapons - is going to be China. They will also be heavily in the hock to China for domestic investment because the EU is systematically shutting up shop in Russia (the Americans never set up shop to begin with).For any nation, it is never a good thing to have your fate be largely at the pleasure of just one other nation.No, not even if that nation is your best friend (just ask the U.K. about the price extracted of their imperial ambitions by the Americans, during and after The Second World War), let alone when that nation is someone youThe Kremlin least of all places cannot be under any illusion that China will not systematically and without pretense, squeeze every drop of that imbalance in power between Moscow and Beijing. How this isChina is also a big winner since with the sudden and almost cataclysmic overthrow of the geopolitical equation in Europe, a material amount of American military heat and muscle is going to be drawn to that theater. Though not quite as much as the Chinese might have hoped for but I’ll get to that shortly.In other words, China now has a powerful sidekick (Russia), and their biggest adversary (America) is forced to hold the line in leading fashion in not just one but two large geopolitical theaters.W2. AMERICAThe biggest benefit to America has been the galvanization of NATO.It is hard to imagine that it was just three years ago when Emmanuel Macron had called NATO “brain dead”, and with good reason. Because it wasn’t clear whether or even IF the Trans-Atlantic alliance had much reason to exist. That has taken an about turn with astonishing speed in a matter of weeks now, and it’s as if we were back to a situation like in 1949 when the alliance was birthed. That’s because we are.The Europeans - and Germany in particular - will have to put more into the pot in terms of defense, their honeymoon of living off the “American security + Russian energy + Chinese market” model is officially over. There was never the need to urge the likes of Poland to up their defense spending, but now the possibility is that even Sweden and Finland might join NATO - Russia just threatened both of them with direThe credibility of American military intelligence and her geopolitical outlook has also been entirely vindicated since they were the one Western power who was warningIf it still isn’t clear by now even as Russian tanks roll into Kiev, that Putin had already carefully planned this invasion months in advance, that all of the trips to Moscow were but a charade to assuage his ego, that how shamelessly Putin and Lavrov were lying through their teeth”They should be standing on the street corner. Selling pencils. From a cup.”But the biggest win for America, which many people haven’t yet realized, is that she won’t have to strain her back trying to corral the EU states together in the conflict against China. For the past few years, the EU attitude with regards to American-Chinese geopolitical competition was very understandably and even very justifiably this -“We’d rather not get into this. We can just continue to increase our trade with China, we don’t need to pick a side since we’re not anywhere near the region of conflict.”All of that goes straight out of the window now. How?With Russia becoming a client state at the mercy of China’s patronage, the equation for the Europeans is grasping this -“The more money you put into Chinese pockets, the more missiles get loaded into Russian guns.”ThisSo fuel and strengthen Chinese economic growth at your own peril.No matter how much mercantile interests or energy needs may protest, as the events of recent days have demonstrated so clearly, you CANNOT just seal these domains - trade, energy and defense - into separate boxes and pretend as if they have no connections or significant influence on each other.W3. FRANCELet me count the ways in how this is anIt is hard to exaggerate just how splendidly well-positioned the French are of all of the EU nations today, partly by blind luck, but mostly through prudence and the French way of doing things.The EU ever since the end of The First Cold War, has been dominated mainly by issues of peace time. With good reason. There was a complacency that Russia was done and dusted with, the main focus was on such matters as trade balances, climate change, immigration, regulations and so on.As always there are two major powers on the continent - France and Germany. France was the dominant power in combined hard terms (military + economic). But because geopolitics was hardly in the equation at all, economic size was everything and hence Germany was the boss.All of that has changed so quickly now.The military factor has come right to the fore and for the EU, security considerations will rightfully trump economic ones. With good reason, because there is no question about prospering when you don’t even survive in the first place! And only a complete fool would trust a security guarantee by Germany, which is not the case with France.France is also blessed with a fantastic geographical position being at other end of the continent from Russia. So she can afford to leverage her power with less fear of invasion. This can be both good and bad in terms of her motivation, but the good thing is that for all of France’s insecurity and ability to take offence, she is the one powerful nation in EuropeAll of those will now be needed and France will take the leading position in Europe with relish. Remember how she was quite understandably very angry at being treated with less respect than she deserved by her allies in the AUKUS alliance - there is no way on God’s green earth that she won’t now grab this opportunity with both hands to take the initiative in Europe. And good for her, the West will be all the better for France deploying her significant muscle locally to defend her continental partners.The French for all of their sclerotic attitude with respect to regulations, were pragmatic and prudent enough to not set themselves up at the mercy of Moscow with respect to energy needs. France has always beenFrance also does not depend very much for trade on China (not even 5% of their exports are to China).It means that the two primary opponents of the Western Alliance - Russia and China -France also has the most well-developed armament industry by far in Western Europe. And it will considerably benefit the her industry as her NATO partners on the continent beef up their forces.It is important to understand that the French model is autarkic. Autarky means that business and geopolitical considerations are tightly knit together and it is national security considerations which then drive business decisions, not the other way around as it is the model in Germany. The autarkic model for strategic resources that are indispensable for national security and self-reliance, is the model which I have always stridently advocated as a security hawk and hard-nosed realist. And like any trade-off, it is not one without serious downsides. It is unarguably at a disadvantage in times of peace because its insistence on national self-reliance, can be a hurdle to no-holds barred globalization in the interests of mercantile growth. But it is at aFrance much like America is largely self-sufficient in all of the key strategic aspects - food, energy, armaments and technology. NOT by chance, but as I hope I have demonstrated point by point above, through deliberate design. A geopolitical model which first factors in the resources and needs of your nation, both natural and human capital, and then cohesively and comprehensively drives policies - financial, military, economic, energy - which systematically both fortify your position and also your ability to project power.Autarky sacrifices some prosperity in times of peace in exchange for far more security in times of war.Whichever way you try and cut it - military, energy, trade - the events of the last two months have moved the equation on the continent heavily in favor of France.Which now brings us to the next part, the three biggest losers.L1. RUSSIARussia is going to bleed economically in the years to come. And it is not merely due to economic retaliation by the West. No, it is going to be a double whammy.The first one is that the economic sanctions being put into place are going to freeze most Western investments in Russia in strategic domains by quite frankly, making them a criminal activity. The assets of Russian oligarchs abroad are toast now. Now it isn’t like the West does not have any assets in Russia which will be screwed, but the thing is thatBut the second one is unarguably even worse - the urgency with which the West are now going to run to make themselves as independent as possible of Russian fossil fuels. This is something which both the clean energy camp and the national security hawks can join hands on, though for very different reasons. Natural gas and oil exports are theAs a drug dealer, if I were forced to choose between two bad options -I know which one I’d take. Now Russia will get BOTH.To be clear, the purposes of sanctions now is not deterrence, that ship has sailed four days ago. Now sanctions have one purpose and one purpose alone - punishment. To starve Russia’s economy and especially her war machine.Good luck with that, Comrade Putin. He may be gone within a couple of decades, but the devastating effect on the Russian economy and her people by these sanctions which will extend for years if not decades, and asphyxiate Russia cruelly and systematically? That suffering will linger well beyond after Putin is put six feet under.Russia has now condemned her future economic survival, because quite frankly, she does not have much to offer the world in terms of goods except energy and weapons. Nobody buys a lot of Russian cars, computers, textiles or medicines. Most of Russian exports are stuff which you dig out of the ground, an extractive economy. And when that model changes, such an economy is simply not innovative enough to adapt.Russia is also now in the hock to a nation (China) which is as brutally realpolitik as they are. A nation which they have a border with in the East, except that the Chinese have 200 million on their side of the border while Russia has 4 million. And where the Russians have considerable fuel resources.Mark my words here - Mongolia may well prove to be for Russia, what Belarus has proven to be for Ukraine. A future Chinese puppet state which then acts as a staging ground for a gigantic invasion. And no, this isn’t the China of the 1950s which Moscow can just dismiss as “Putin and Xi’s marriage may not be nearly as dystopian as that between Hitler and Stalin,Hitler and Stalin’s “partnership” above is the most well known, but the list is endless in just the last century.Pick whichever pair you please, dictators who shared the same neighborhood or a border - Hitler-Mussolini, Stalin-Mao, Saddam-Hafez, Hafez-Nasser, Saddam-Reza Pahlavi, Mubarak-Gaddafi - how many more do you want me to list, how much time do you have?ItPutin’s proffered objective with the whole prelude and then act of invasion was the supposed threat from NATO? (which btw is a complete crock of shit, which I will address in another answer) - well congratulations Tsar! You’ve just managed to achieve the precise opposite. I honestly don’t think he wasHe made a calculated gamble that this crisis would fracture NATO and that he would be able to peel off the EU and especially Germany away from America and evict the latter from the continent. Notwithstanding the fact that Germany has embarrassingly had to be dragged kicking and screaming into supporting the others, the fact is that the Eastern Flank of NATO, now will be armed right to the teeth.Even as I write these words, five thousandSo Russia has alarmed her enemies, made them beef up their defenses, made them move as fast as they can away from the one product she must sell, and simultaneously delivered her fate into the hands of a ruthless regime with whom a reckoning in the East will come. And when (not if) that reckoning arrives at the east end of Siberia, Russia will be in a level of trouble which is hard to now comprehend.Anyway you try and square it, this was NOT about Russian security or interests at all. No, it was about Putin maintaining power in the Kremlin.Russians will come to see it in the decades ahead (I suspect that many already do), but for a nation whose men are quite literally drinking themselves to death, the hour will be too late by then.L2. GERMANYWhere to start?Everything I said about France above? Yeah okay now, just flip it over and you have Germany. Germany’s credibility as a geopolitical partner and her potency at doingLook, it is easy to mock the Germans for their contribution of .. helmets…. to Ukraine. I sarcastically said that they’d next contribute trucks of condoms to Kiev so Ukrainian women can avoid pregnancy and STDs after mass rapes by Russian soldiers. But seriously, you have to understand that the position which Germany finds herself today in, is a culmination of systematic miscalculation, mercantilism and short-sightedness over at least two decades. In that sense, I feel genuine empathy for the current German government because they’ve been dealt aEver since her unification, Germany all but jettisoned any security considerations. In the decision halls of Berlin when it came to foreign policy, EVERYTHING was subject to Germany’s mercantile interests. Everything was through the lens of “Will this help or hinder German exports and economic growth?” Germany in terms of her geopolitical strategy was like an anti-Russia. And that’sToday Germany finds herself with no military credibilityHer army, the Bundeswehr, is acknowledged by German insiders to be a shell of a force with a pitifully low proportion of actually operational equipment. I recently read an answer by Roland Bartetzko about how the quality of soldiers in the Austrian Army (I’d never heard of it ever since WW1) was one of the best in the world and almost as good as Germany’s! Very persuasive, I was impressed and wrote a comment on his answer saying that it’s like boasting“It’s of little relevance what a nation’s training program for officers and enlisted men isAre your naval officers honing their skills in fishing boats? Are your artillery officers practicing with water cannons? Are your future fighter aces training with Lufthansa’s commercial fleet?How good can your warriors be when you don’t provide adequate machinery in peace time for them to sharpen the skills they will need in war time?Even Germany’s vaunted economic size proved at best to be hollow, and at worst to be a hindrance. She had to be dragged kicking and screaming because Russia could just cut off her energy. I had warnedGermany will suffer the hardest economic pain now because this weaning off Russian oil and gas will be the sharpest for her since she is the one most dependent on it. And to be fair, it is ridiculous and unrealistic to ask her to just cut it off overnight. She’s already cancelled Nord Stream II which is significant. Even with a chronic drug addict or alcoholic, if you just cut the drug off overnight you seriously risk killing the patient themselves. No, they need to be weaned off as quickly as possible but also as sensibly as warranted. You want to destroy the disease, not the patient. Even with German (and Italian) opposition to cutting off Russia from the SWIFT financial communications system, it isn’t as stupid as some seem to think - because doing that would make it extremely difficult for Germany to pay for Russian gas supplies and literally condemn millions of people in these aging nations to the cold and dark. German sins of the last two decades are bad but notThat said, Germany needs to be acutely conscious that for so long as she understandably needs and pays for Russian gas and oil, she unfortunately will be funding the Russian military machine. Likewise with trade with China. And hopefully that consciousness lights a fire under her to urgently do everything within her power to pivot away from those dependencies.To please try and get yourself away from men who you know…. wantonly invade their neighbors and also throw hundreds of thousands of their innocent citizens into concentration camps for no reason but their ethnicity. After all, your nation did have a guy once who did precisely both of those things in spades. Then be conscious of it and don’t be complicit in such evils any more than you absolutely have to be only for the time being understandably for your survival. Because believe me Germany, in the long-term youGermany is also likely to see another serious influx of refugees only second to Poland - but this time around at least the migrants won’t go around sexually assaulting German women en masse.There is no upside to this for Germany. None.Her military impotence has been exposed. Her energy dependence on Russia making her vulnerable to economic blackmail, has been the chief hindrance to Western sanctions. And finally her refusal to let even allies send arms to Ukraine prior to the conflict has plummeted her reputation among her partners to new depths.I don’t want to rub it in any further but I hope that she seriously takes stock of the long path in how she came to be in the terrible position where she finds herself right now, then weans herself off Russian energy and finds new suppliers, re-opens her nuclear plants, starts spending more money on her defense.Oh, and all of this talk of a “United States of Europe” which was the policy declared by the the current German coalition government as soon as they came to power late last year? Yeah, forget about it.L3. INDIAThis one’s personal for me since it’s my motherland I’m speaking about here, I love her as passionately as I fear for her safety.But most Indians don’t even seem to realize how bad this is for them, given that the theater of conflict in Ukraine is seemingly so far away. Let me piece it together this way -You do the math.When it comes to prioritizing Indian or Chinese interests, the choice will not even be a close one for Russia.Because though Russia traditionallyTo make matters worse, Russia seems to be warming up to that other old enemy of India, Pakistan. Pakistan as China’s client state in South Asia, comes as a ‘package deal’ with China. Or as one of my favorite Indian analysts, Shekhar Gupta put it quite comically, it’s like how in the 80s if you bought a large box of washing detergent powder (China), you also got a tiny soap bar (Pakistan) for free.Indians who still continue to support Russia don’t realize what terrible risk they are running, as China continues to encircle their nation systematically with bases in Myanmar, Sri Lanka and now Pakistan.And this danger to India and geopolitical competition from China is not like that between America and Russia. Because China is big, she is going to be powerful and most importantly, she is going nowhere. India is stuck with her. These two nations are too big and too close to each other for there to be a lasting peace between them, the threat willTo make matters worse, it is clear to me that with China’s population ageing rapidly, she will seek to make India a client puppet state as a dumping ground for her goods. To knee cap India, and then do to my nation, what the British East India Company once did for a century. Those national memories are too painful to countenance having to experience them again.Now it is understandable and prudent that the Indians have not come out condemning Russia. But the few morons among my countrymen whose hatred for America isSome of these clowns even talk about Russia mediating between India and China. These people don’t seem to grasp a simple principle of geopolitics -It would be like a wolf (Russia) trying to negotiate between a tiger (China) and a boar (India). The tiger will quite simply tell the wolf “Who the hell are you anyway? Go get lost, I’ll kill and eat the boar when I please!”Russia’s ever closer movement into China’s patronage is HORRIBLE news for India.India needs to do three things in my estimate and do themIndia is sorely lacking in self-sufficiency in two critical components - energy and armaments. So long as she is not secure with both of those, she will always risk being held hostage by her suppliers, no matter how rich she may grow.Nations have no permanent friends or enemies, only permanent interests. And India needs to realize that this attitude of non-alignment was all good and fine during the First Cold War. It was prudent even but then she had the luxury of sitting it out since the sphere of potential conflict was far away in Europe.That isYou cannot be hanging off a cliff with waves violently crashing below you, and say that you are neutral in your opinion about drowning!But it is clear to me and to some Indian national security advisors at least, that this episode driving a traditional ally into the arms of the worst and most powerful enemy is an unmitigated catastrophe for India.In conclusion,One final thing as a side note - I think that the British seem to have lucked out by leaving the EU just in the nick of time. And I have to say that with them being one of America’s most loyal friends and as one of the only European nations that demonstrated both honor and nerve against Russian predation when the hour of test arrived, I could not be more glad for them. Add to that the fact that Britain very prudently (like France) does not depend heavily on Russian gas.It would be ridiculous for any Brexiteer to take credit for the UK’s good fortune now, because nobody could have seen this coming in 2016. But given the curb stomping that the EU economy is about to experience, I cannot imagine any Remainer in the UK still saying now or for a long time to come, without them getting smacked in the mouth -“See? See??? I told you we should have stayed in the EU!”",0 followers,Henrey Bradley,7.9K,390,32.9M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Would-American-aircraft-suffer-the-same-losses-of-jets-and-helicopters-if-they-were-engaged-in-a-similar-conflict-such-as-Ukraine-and-Russia

Russia doenst seem to focus on SEAD as much as the West. And when you think about it, it makes sense…. Russia (and the Soviets) led the world in air defense as a strategy. The West prefers airplanes to anti-airplane systems.Russia might be at a weird disadvantage here because they arent fighting who they dreamed of fighting (NATO). Instead, fighting a clone…. A military that relies more on Air Defense than Air Force.The Soviets created a very formidable and cost effective counter to the West’s advantage in airplane tech in the 50s and 60s by way of super advanced anti-aircraft guns and missiles. The US learned a hard lesson in Vietnam, as did Israel in the Yom Kipour war.And both sides learned the lessons, and developed counters.The counters arent perfect (nothing ever is).

11,"Yes and no.Part of why the Russia/Ukraine conflict is so brutal is because they are essentially fighting themselves. Its all Russian equipment and capabilities. Even if the Russian kit is slightly better, it does not appear to be THAT much better. Losses are high because instead of one side dominating the other, they are fighting on an even playing field, and canceling each other out as a result. Its hard to argue this conflict isn’t becoming a meat grinder.Generally speaking, “even” fights cause more destruction and casualties.So on one hand, if the US ever found itself fighting a former allyYes and no.Part of why the Russia/Ukraine conflict is so brutal is because they are essentially fighting themselves.

Its hard to argue this conflict isn’t becoming a meat grinder.Generally speaking, “even” fights cause more destruction and casualties.So on one hand, if the US ever found itself fighting a former ally equipped with many of the same weapons systems, I would suspect that we would have our eyes blacked a little. The more even the playing field, the more opportunity the enemy has to counter us, and the more mistakes will be punished.That said, the US specifically appears to be better equipped to “fight itself” than the Russians. The US not only has its “Wild Weasel” specialist aircraft to deal with the SAM threat, but it has aircraft like the F22 that is a specialist Air-superiority aircraft, and the B2 that is a specialist strategic bombing aircraft. It also has a currently unparalleled navy.Theoretically, a US-armed enemy nation could still find itself on the wrong end of an asymmetric fight against the United States, presuming we didn’t just throw equivalent aircraft and pilots against each other.Russia by comparison doesn’t really have that. They have tried to go the more economical route and have focused many of their weapons systems against NATO and the US. The west appears to more strongly rely on fighter aircraft and AWACS for air defense. It makes sense for them to have focused their limited budget on high-speed interceptors to knock down AWACS and hypersonic missiles to kill airbases and aircraft carriers. They don’t really have a counter to their own doctrine of large numbers of mobile SAM sites. The missiles exist for sure, but the vibe I’ve gotten is that they are limited in stock and stingy with their use.If the US isn’t so stingy, then they are likely to overwhelm a Ukrainian equivalent conflict.",1 follower,Bill Phillips,1K,495,599.3K,2021,https://www.quora.com/Would-American-aircraft-suffer-the-same-losses-of-jets-and-helicopters-if-they-were-engaged-in-a-similar-conflict-such-as-Ukraine-and-Russia

13,"The simple answer is the US use of aircrafts at the start of a conflict is governed by the tactics, coordination, and inter service operations it has mastered and refined since WWII.For example, in the initial start of a conflict against an opponent with similar means, the most important effort will be directed at the opposing forces key military assets such as air fields, air defense systems, supply depots, transportation systems, military bases etc., and the achievement of air superiority over the battlefield and zone of operation.The initial Russian effort failed to achieve air superiorityThe simple answer is the US use of aircrafts at the start of a conflict is governed by the tactics, coordination, and inter service operations it has mastered and refined since WWII.For example, in the initial start of a conflict against an opponent with similar means, the most important effort will be directed at the opposing forces key military assets such as air fields, air defense systems, supply depots, transportation systems, military bases etc., and the achievement of air superiority over the battlefield and zone of operation.The initial Russian effort failed to achieve air superiority let alone suppress and destroy air defense sites and assets resulting in high attritions of Russian aircrafts, both fighter jets and helicopters.While many would use the Gulf War as a good example, the period of approximately six months was used to soften up (air assault) the Iraqi military forces before ground forces moved into attack. The best example of initial air strikes at the start of a conflict would be the 1967 Arab-Israeli war in which the Israelis achieved air superiority and ground defense suppression quickly and in a very short length of time before they used air power in support of the ground forces.","3,167 followers",Albina Griniute,4.5K,291,2.7M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Would-American-aircraft-suffer-the-same-losses-of-jets-and-helicopters-if-they-were-engaged-in-a-similar-conflict-such-as-Ukraine-and-Russia
14,"Depends on the weather and the target type. Average CEP of JDAM during 2003 OIF was 2.65m. We have radars which will support that, through clouds from 10–12nm release points, above 25,00ft. But not against most tactical target sets like those which the VKS are hitting.Under the weather (typically 10–15,000ft), things get a lot more dicey but our targeting pods are good and the fact that both the Ukrainians and the Russians have absolutely lousy field discipline and most of our ‘CAS bombs’ have airburst modes means we would still be able to hit most target sets (and yes, you can see a ‘camp sitDepends on the weather and the target type.

Even well away from their vehicles, they would not be safe, and your BRL breakaway is still about 4-6nm out. Which means that, unless they have an absolutely superb FAAD interlock with shoulder fire SAM teams well out under the ground track of any attack, your GBU-12 goes further than they can see the source of the jet noise, let alone shoot back.The biggest issue here is that, except for the A-10 and 5-Gen, most of the teen jets don’t have MAWS built in but only available through /some/ of their centerline jammer pods. You’re right on the edge of what a man portable can cover and well within the capabilities of the Strela-10 of the SA-9/13 while the SA-8/15/19/22 are a genuine threat.A step past this is the Maverick and Hellfire. Now, you’re talking about 4nm from medium height and often as short as 2nm If you get low and close. Line of sight as much as Wx or kinematics driven. We don’t like to be here. We can do it, with effective drone support or a ground designator. But it’s not a good place to be as every threat has the kinematic potential to catch you, even if you see the launch and act on it with good speed on the jet.Our biggest advantage here is that our weapon is going to hit so we’re not going to have to come back around and, again, we can typically see most targets on the pod about 2–3 times the distance which we can shoot them, so we can kind’ve set things up to our best advantage, especially at night. Bad munitions have _long_ been a complaint in the Western air services, going back to the first days of LANTIRN, in the early 90s. We have big, clunky, low shot count, short ranged, CAS weapons. Except for the British. Who have Brimstone which is neat and it would be really nice if Santa would leave some JAGM’d under our tree but he never does…The Russians could more or less do this level of ‘precision CAS’ too except their Kh-25/29 stockpile is tiny and mostly day-TV/SAL limited. And so they do most of their work from 1–2nm, with rockets and FABs, as everyone looks right at them. And shoots them in the teeth.As others have stated, most of our initial efforts would be aimed at removing medium and tactical SAM and using JASSM, MALD and AARGM based DEAD oriented off ASQ-239, drone or satellite captured site locations; but if our leadership got the great idea to rush in and be heroes as the Ukrainians started to fold, you would also see a lot of swing missioning in an unreduced threat GBAD environment as we struggled to say cleanly separate and disengage ZSU forces facing overrun around Dnipro and Zaporizhya, trying to use CAS to generate operational space to get them across the river at say Cherkasy and Mykolaiv, while still defending against any endrun on Odessa.That kind of air-as-block-force screening action would be very fluid and we would almost certainly have to fight the ground threat while still facing active SA-11/17/19/20/21 systems, dominating the medium level fight.We would need to go in low and slow to deconflict very similar vehicle types and while, again, our LDPs (and hopefully JTACs/Reapers) would help, the fact is that the F-35, without AARGM-ER or GBU-53, would be all but useless at either ‘both bombs today’ stealth CAS /or/ SEAD and so our F-16CM force would have to swing. And we don’t have enough AGM-65 rails to be standoff assured.Dunno exactly what that would look like, but I’m pretty certain it would be ugly. We could end up taking a LOT of losses and time would not be on our side as most of the railnet to the West is now cut. So we would have to hold the line as whatever is left of the Ukrainian military pulled back, got across the Dnieper and flowed into our lines which might very well have to shorten, somewhere much further West (Zhytomyr-Vinnytsya-Odessa) than we would ideally like. If the Russians hold Kherson, Mykolaiv is useless as a port but if you don’t hold the Kyiv-Cherkasy-Mykolaiv line, then Odessa is no longer viable either and Ukraine has no grain export economy until we can rebuild her rail lines to Europe, under constant Iskander threat.It would all just depend on how we chose to fight the war. And how much retaining a ZSU ground force was seen as politically worth having so as to accommodate their minimal night-operational capability. It would have to be a very bad day for the Ukrainians for us to be intervening at this late point. But given who we have as POTUS, I would not be at all surprised if we got there.One last thing: Fuel Counts. Ukraine is a long country. If we had to fly 450–500nm East from Bialystok or worse, come down to the Black Sea and across, to avoid an SA-21 threat out of Belarus and Southern Russia, the mission just got ten times harder because CAS loads tend to be very draggy and the Russians might well choose to face us down with MiG-31 or Su-35 DCA out of Crimea (four airbases) or the Sea of Azov (three). Combined with the Black Sea Flotille (Marshal Ustinov with one Gorshkov, three Grigorivich and two Krivaks), they could easily threaten our AWACS and tanker orbits unless Turkey allowed some USN AAW SAGs in past the Bosporus to support us.With the kinds of fast ASCM the Russians have, we could not allow this be a defensive fight so the Russians would have to lose multiple 250–500 crewed naval assets, and that would likely be the start of an extremely bad week or three, for all of us.","5,995 followers",Hrithik Ramraj,11.4K,3.4K,349M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Would-American-aircraft-suffer-the-same-losses-of-jets-and-helicopters-if-they-were-engaged-in-a-similar-conflict-such-as-Ukraine-and-Russia
