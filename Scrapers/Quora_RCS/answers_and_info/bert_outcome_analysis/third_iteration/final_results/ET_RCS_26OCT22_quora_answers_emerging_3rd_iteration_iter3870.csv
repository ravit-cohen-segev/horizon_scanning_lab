0,"There are basically no ""lost"" technologies which we cannot replicate today. There might be some that we are not quite sure how the effect was achieved, but they are not particularly advanced, and it's just a lack of knowledge. There were no space aliens giving our ancestors advanced knowledge. We know how the pyramids were built, we know how the Romans made concrete, we know how the Vikings and the Polynesians navigated.

1,"Basically, it could not.Technological civilizations such as ours are archaeologically, for lack of a better word, noisy. We support populations orders of magnitude larger than pre-industrial societies, we produce exponentially more goods, and we alter the landscape in lots and lots of ways.Even a fairly late pre-industrial society can leave a big mark on the planet.

Consider the Colombian exchange. Through the 17th and 18th centuries, there was a massive reordering of species around the planet. Old World species like pigs, cattle, wheat, oats, and barley were taken to the Americas, and species like corn, tomatoes, potatoes, chiles, and so on where exported. Just that is visible in the archaeological record as a significant and relatively sudden change.And that’s nothing compared to what our own industrial society has been doing over the course of the past century or so. Things like leaded gasoline, the massive use of fossil fuels, and our toying with atomic energy has left all kinds of easily detectable chemical traces all over the planet. We routinely cut through hills to build roadways. We tear down entire mountains to mine for coal and minerals. We alter the courses of rivers and use dams to make new lakes. And we produce massive garbage dumps full of the broken and discarded products of our technological society with plastics, weird alloys from discarded electronics, and all kinds of other chemicals not found in nature. The changes we make to the environment are profound.So, then, how is all of that going away without a trace? It’s not. It can’t.

The Coopers who failed ended up making “dry barrels” that only held produce or things that wouldn’t spoil. There are very few people who know how to make a barrel today. Even Jack Daniels, the biggest barrel maker in the world, uses an automated process now because making them by hand is too slow. The art of coopering is dying. There are very, very few people who know how to make a barrel left in the world and fewer every year, yet barrel making was an advanced technology that changed the entire world for literally thousands of years.Incidentally. the most prolific barrel in the world today is the ASB or American Standard Barrel that hold 53 gallons because America makes more barrels than anyone else in the world. Many used Jack Daniels barrels are re-used to make other kinds of liquor in other parts of the world.Do you know who the highest paid man in the community was in “ancient times”? It was the Wheelwright.Making a wheel from wood with an axle that attaches to a cart and doesn’t fall apart within a mile or two is one of the most “advanced technologies” of all time. Without it, most civilizations would have failed or failed to spread. Cart wheels are complex and the forces must play against each other continuously to hold the wheel together as it rolls. A Cartwright made as much then as a jet airline pilot back does today. In the 1880s when the average wage was $1.50 a day, the Wheelwright was making 90 dollars a week. On the Mayflower they brought one single cart over to America and it was the most valuable thing on the ship manifest, worth more than 10 times the next most valuable thing on the ship. Can you make a cartwheel?

There are still lots of problems which Wakanda would have at truly isolating themselves and concealing how advanced technologically they are.One of the things I was thinking about is the historical side of things. Historically almost all African countries were colonised by European colonial powers (the few non-colonised ones were made subservient through being made protectorates of European empires. So what I was wondering is, what about Wakanda? Would Europeans not have tried to colonise Wakanda? They most definitely would have tried and so Wakanda would not simply be able to isolate themselves. The Wakandans wouldn’t have let them take over though and seeing as they are more technologically advanced, they could have repelled European conquests. Had they done so though, the Europeans would have been made aware of the fact that Wakanda has advanced technology.","18,451 followers",Nathan Stanish,12.5K,2.3K,62.4M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-examples-of-ancient-civilizations-that-had-advanced-technology-but-disappeared-without-a-trace

If anyone knew, you wSearch for a way to die.One year ago, I would have preferred immortality to death.But after debating with a friend, I beg to to differ.Immortality is not something to be desired.You have to watch all of your loved ones die.You have to make new friends, but you know you will be at their funerals.You can’t open up to anyone, since you don't want anyone to know you are immortal. If anyone knew, you would be thrown into a lab and be experimented on endlessly.You don't become attached to anything.You get easily bored and lack motivation to do anything. Why do it now when you have all of eternity?You will watch the world slowly grow old and descend into chaos.You are essentially trapped forever.So yeah, I would definitely be searching for a way to die and escape thi...","15,676 followers",Sarthak Raj Baral,7.1K,550,66M,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-examples-of-ancient-civilizations-that-had-advanced-technology-but-disappeared-without-a-trace

23,"Will I live long enough to see technology able to extend my life considerably?As of time I am writing this, there are quite a few answers, but none that actually answer the question.The answer is, it is quite likely that you will. I know several people working in the field of radical longevity, and I'm dating a research scientist working in the field. The general consensus among the scientists and researchers I've spoken to is that if you can live until 2045, there's a very good chance you will see breakthroughs in radical longevity that can benefit you.",0 followers,Derek Maurice,862,222,4.3M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Is-it-really-possible-that-an-isolated-country-like-Wakanda-could-develop-such-advanced-technology-assuming-they-were-invisible-to-the-world

25,"Why is technology for extending life taking long?Mostly because a great many people don’t think it’s desirable, possible, or both, so it’s remarkably poorly funded and there aren’t a lot of folks doing it.Wouldnt gathering 100k of scientist around the world put them in a building similar of a pentagon, fund billions on research by convincing the riches people alive. Use prisoners & animals for experiments.Well, yes. And you wouldn’t need to experiment on prisoners.I would be surprised to learn that anti-aging research worldwide gets a billion dollars a year in funding.

Google’s Calico Labs, for example, was started with something like $500 million, which sounds like a lot if you’ve never done R&D but is far less than Intel spends on one new processor design.By way of comparison, the National Football League brings in about $12 billion, or $12,000 million, a year.","28,755 followers",Ray Schilling,608,8K,102.4M,2017,https://www.quora.com/Is-it-really-possible-that-an-isolated-country-like-Wakanda-could-develop-such-advanced-technology-assuming-they-were-invisible-to-the-world
