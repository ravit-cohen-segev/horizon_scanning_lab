3,"Poverty in third world countries is caused by numerous factors to even mention here but I am going to elaborate most important points in reference to African states. Corrupt governments is one of the factors but not primarily the main cause because corrupt governments are in each and every country, no world government is perfect.Poverty in third world countries is mostly caused by the established capitalist world system that works against third world countries but mostly African countries. The evil capitalist system only favors western countries at the expense of African countries. Moreover, APoverty in third world countries is caused by numerous factors to even mention here but I am going to elaborate most important points in reference to African states. Corrupt governments is one of the factors but not primarily the main cause because corrupt governments are in each and every country, no world government is perfect.Poverty in third world countries is mostly caused by the established capitalist world system that works against third world countries but mostly African countries. The evil capitalist system only favors western countries at the expense of African countries. Moreover, African countries are not treated as equal partners on world trade but as slaves, inferiors and aliens. Africans have resources but cannot even put a price on their products, a buyer detects the price. Where have you seen that happening in this world except against the third world countries ? It’s like someone saying I want to buy your house together with your wive and children for $20, if you don’t want my offer then I will either take it by force or just destroy you. That is the circumstance and predicament Africa is in. With that being said, Africa cannot deliver herself but remain abused, crying, shouting and complaining in the wilderness. No action whatsoever, as you know action speaks louder than words.The is no reason why a $1 should be trading to South African R15 on stock exchange. I don’t see any justification for that. As long as those rules are in place, third countries will forever be bullied, abused and suffocated without any immediate remedy. So this is a big factor that causes poverty, such rules will make sure that you loose before you are born.Another cause of poverty in third word countries is lack of manufacturing industries to have finished products and for employment creation. As long as African countries continues buying everything from China, from bottled water to underwear, they will forever remain in bondage, in slavery and worse still in poverty.Colonialism and slavery has caused poverty among Africans. When Europeans came to colonize African countries they only came with weapons, took everything Africans had, including all the beautiful woman. An African man was dispossessed, dehumanized and disillusioned. Slavery took all the best and strong able bodied Africans in their millions, this of course left Africa with weak and less skilled Africans. Therefore slavery and colonialism created generational poverty. France as we speak is still receiving $billions from 14 west African states as colonial tax. In other words that little country called France together with their corrupt and evil governments are responsible for impoverishment of those countries.The sad part is that most African governments have failed to understand the plight & predicament of their people. Instead they are very corrupt to the core, they steal all the left overs and leave their countries with nothing, worsening the already existing poverty problems.",26 followers,Balaji Viswanathan,3.5K,5.6K,427M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-at-the-major-reasons-that-third-world-country-people-are-so-poor-such-as-lack-of-free-market-mechanism-advanced-technology-natural-resources-or-government-corruption

6,"Poverty doesn't link directly to corruption in a country, but it does seem to be the case that there is a correlation.Transparency International report 2015As for why there is a link:Poor countries might not be able to afford to pay their police and civil servants a high salary. Government employees therefore feel the need to supplement their income by taking bribes or charging 'user fees' for their services.

Government employees therefore feel the need to supplement their income by taking bribes or charging 'user fees' for their services. This can lead to a vicious circle where the government does not feel it has to pay its workers a living wage, because they know they'll supplement it through corruption.The fact that some poor countries cannot afford to pay their police and officials a high salary also has a knock-on effect. Law enforcement in such countries will often be weak and inefficient in consequence, which means that corruption in wider society will go uninvestigated and unpunished.Poor countries often lack a social safety net or welfare benefits. Someone who becomes sick or loses their job will therefore need to turn to their family to help them through their difficulty. This leads to a mindset that family members must support each other financially, which can lead to nepotism being an accepted practice — perhaps not even seen as wrong.In some societies, an alternative to family or the State for welfare might be a patron; a local political leader, landowner, gang boss, clan chieftain, mafia capo or trade union organiser. In return for helping those in difficulties (often with a 'loan' rather than charity), the patron will naturally expect favours in return, such as voting for the candidates they support in elections.Turning the idea around, it can also be argued that high corruption in a country is a factor in keeping it poor. Suppose a young entrepreneur has an idea for a new business. In a low-corruption country, they can just set up a company and start trading straight away; no problem.In a high-corruption country, however, they would first need to bribe an array of local officials for 'planning permits' and 'trading licences', and pay off the local police to avoid being shut down for 'safety violations'. This creates a barrier to innovation that only those with the right connections or wealth can get past.","33,149 followers",Susanna Viljanen,847,10.7K,164.8M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-at-the-major-reasons-that-third-world-country-people-are-so-poor-such-as-lack-of-free-market-mechanism-advanced-technology-natural-resources-or-government-corruption

I relied on my husband’s generosity to free up time and money- a position as demeaning as it is codependent. And he wasn’t always generous or even appreciative of my “sacrifices.”I adored my three kids, ages 1, 4 and 6 when I left marketing for good. This does not mean I loved them pouring sand on the dog or hiding so well I panicked that they had wandered up the drive and into the culdesac.I had no grownups to relieve me. I had a passive aggressive mother in law who I found screaming inches from my son’s face as he sat locked in his car seat. At that moment she was done being a caregiver for my brood. I had a drop in daycare mom who was soon accused of sexual indiscretions. My own family lived 1000 miles away and all my neighbors had jobs.Each of my children had challenges I was able to address by remaining home, noticing, and dealing with their looming disasters.I know if I hadn’t relentlessly pursued why my daughter wasn’t reading in kindergarten after a table at school knocked out her teeth, she would not have finally begun reading at age 10 and eventually graduated college Summa Cum laude.If I hadn’t quit everything to feed my son a rotation diet, he wouldn’t have passed the Navy physical and flown jets.And if I hadn’t pulled my eldest daughter out of a school where she had dumbed down her reading to fit in and instead found an inspiring expeditionary school that challenged her at all levels, she would not be mentoring high school teachers today.I can say that a husband with a wife at home in sweats might just resent her appearing to have all the fun. He might develop a wandering eye. It does happen. Such events may be crazy-making to the point where the wife goes back to grad school to earn her MFA and regain her sanity. And save her marriage.Staying home with the kids as a woman is considered “less than” by today’s working women standards. Best to break glass ceilings- or at least try. A dark side to staying home was the perception that I counted little. My clothes were worn. I couldn’t contribute to causes with cash; I could only volunteer my time.Children in our contemporary world are separated from their parents and caged. They are cut off from programs like the Arts and Languages. Littles are shot in our schools. And lawmakers focus on tax cuts for the wealthy. Offspring are too often irrelevant —except perhaps when it comes to getting into prestigious colleges. If we as a society disparage children, why would their caretakers be treated any different? Teachers are not.The dark side to staying home is struggling to find your own self worth, because no one is going to give you a Christmas bonus, paid sick leave and a home computer or the big one: Respect.The light side?

They want to have a healthy and friendly relationship with their children without surrendering parental authority.We are always torn between our technical and parental obligations. We feel as if we are neglecting the other while we are focused on one! This is a common problem for today's parents, who are frequently overworked.2. Not being able to tell ‘NO.'Everyone wants their children to like them. We must, however, learn that we do not have to say ""yes"" to anything. To stop the feeling of entitlement that so many children today have, it's often easier to say ""no"" or ""maybe.""3. A blaming societyThere's a lot of pressure to get the best sleeper, the first toilet trained child, the smartest child, the cutest child, and so on. Breastfeeding, feeding healthy food, staying busy, and so on are under a lot of stress. I believe that this causes parents to rush into poor parenting decisions and feel guilty for not doing it perfectly.4. Data overloadParents struggle to find their own special way of parenting in a generation bombarded with knowledge about raising their children. Parents today are much more educated than previous generations, but this can sometimes lead to knowledge overload, with several points of view on the same subject. There is no one size fits all solution and, leading to parents asking which advice to follow.The only advice I have for parents is to let their children be children because they are only that way for a short time. The most difficult task for parents is to slow down. Productivity and activity are highly valued in modern society.

Initially they seemed like a very nice couple they treated me and my little brother well. But they then started changing the way they treated me specifically when I was about six. I’m not sure why I was their target. Till this day I find myself wondering if I did something wrong for them to treat me like they did?It was Christmas Eve of 2011 and they allowed me and my brothers to open one gift that night. I don’t remember what I got but I remember what my youngest brother Eraca’s son got. It was a little computer that taught you the letters of the alphabet and I grabbed it from him to look at it. When I did that Christian scolded me and asked me why I hit my little brother with it. I was really confused because I know I didn’t hit him with anything. That night I was thrown outside and had to sit on the porch in the cold for hours. That was the night everything changed for me.Eraca was gone Monday through Friday so that just left us kids with Christian to care for us, she was a stay at home mom. Christian is the one who basically did everything to me. She had many different torture methods for me everyday while ‘her sons’ watched Cartoons and got to play outside. She would throw me into cold baths and put ice cubes in it and made me lay in it for hours. When she was feeling really good she liked to hold my head under water and attempt to drown me. I was only fed once a day, and if I didn’t do a chore right she wouldn’t feed me at all. Sometimes I went a whole week without receiving any food. It came to the point were in the middle of the night sometimes I would sneak into the kitchen and eat almost a whole entire box of cereal because I was so hungry.One night I got caught stealing food and Eraca and Christian decided that since I liked to steal food I should be chained up. So the next day they went to home depot and purchased a dog chain for me. When we got home Eraca drilled the chain into the wall and chained me by my ankle. I was chained up everyday unless they had something they needed me to do, or if Christian was in the mood to do something crazy to me.It came to the point were I was scared to ask if I could go to the restroom so I would constantly piss myself and poop on myself. I started doing it almost everyday and it became a habit but it was also disgusting to me because sooner or later I started smelling bad and Christian would just make me walk around like that while I did my chores. When I did sometimes get the courage to ask to use the restroom Christian would punch, kick me and drag me to the restroom.They would have my little brothers pee on me, and Christian would sometime make me drink her pee. I was starting to get very weak from not eating and I started to have little black outs while doing chores. Just for the hell of it they would sometimes have me bathe in bleach and it came to a point were the skin on some of my toes was falling off. Christian would also put lemon juice on the missing flesh of my toes before sending me to sleep. That was one of the worst pains I've ever felt. They put me through more torture everyday that I just don’t want to think about.I was saved on March 14 2014 ,and from there my biological brother and I were adopted into a Family. They changed our names and now my last name is Ochinang. I call them the Ochinangs since that’s their last name. When I got adopted I really thought I was safe and wouldn’t have to go through abuse again but little did I know.. For five years their biological son who was only two days older than me molested me and I never said anything because that’s what I learned to do best at Christian’s house. The parents never believed me and when I told them the mom said I was lying for attention. They never really supported me, and the mom also didn’t accept the fact that I was bisexual so she was always telling me I wasn’t normal and that I was going to hell.I finally reported the sexual abuse to authorities on November 2018 when I was in the eighth grade. I got removed from my adoptive home, and since then I've been in this horrible foster system. I’m only fifteen-years-old and I have gone through the worst of the worst and I’m still here fighting for the love of a family. I’m in a group home at the moment until a family wants me. But I am a troubled teenager and most families see me as a bad kid. That’s how its been since May 2019. So right now I’m still going through a very bad time, but I’m still going to continue to be strong for myself. I just wanted to share my story with everyone..Emily(Insta- retr0.angel)I just wanted to say thank you so much for everyone’s support! It means a lot to meThis is me btwOk Update!!!—So I have found a very great family who is taking me in I’m very happy and i’ve always waited for this moment i’m truly blessed. I also wanted to say that I recently found my bio mom after 13 years of looking for her it turns out when I was younger those two women that abused me kidnapped me and my little brother from my bio family when I was younger!!! My mom was in tears when we found each other.Thank you so much for everyones support and kind words I love you so much. things really can get better :)","5,990 followers",Jens Böttiger,566,2.6K,17.6M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-at-the-major-reasons-that-third-world-country-people-are-so-poor-such-as-lack-of-free-market-mechanism-advanced-technology-natural-resources-or-government-corruption

The woman had a hard time controlling the mischievous fellows and you always hear her yelling at them to eat their food or clear out their toys.Once I ran out of rice flour, which I needed for the dish I was preparing.

The woman had a hard time controlling the mischievous fellows and you always hear her yelling at them to eat their food or clear out their toys.Once I ran out of rice flour, which I needed for the dish I was preparing. I reached over at her place and saw the door open.I tiptoed inside and there was silence. It was weird and scary. There wasn't a time that I had not heard a noise from this house.I called out the lady's name and peeped into the passageway.“In the bedroom.” She called out.I reached the bedroom and peeped inside. She was sitting near the window with her legs folded and head resting on the window grill.“Are you alright? Where are the kids?” I asked concerned.“They have cold. So they slept in the afternoon today being all drowsy from the cold medicine.”“Aah.” I said. “What are you doing?”“Nothing.”“Nothing?” I ask.“Yeah. You won't understand. After becoming a mother, sometimes doing nothing at all is a bliss.”“You are tired huh?” I ask emphatically.She smiled and asked, “You know the hardest part of being a parent?”I nodded my head sideways.“Parents can't complain. We can't tell anyone we are tired or irritated or angry about something. We just can't. Whom do we complain to? Parents? They will be all like, “This is how kids are. You need to be patient. You were like this too. We handled you too, didn't we? Stop whining.” Or our friends who will be like, “That's why you shouldn't have kids. It's a nightmare. Didn't you know what you are getting into?” And God forbid if I talk my heart out to elderly people. “You have three sons! How more lucky can you get. Stop with your complains. We all did it. How hard can it be?”“You could talk to someone of your age who also have kids of your kids age..” I said trying to help her not knowing what to say next other than this.“Haha! No. If I do, I would be shown how they have more problems than me and mine is nothing in front of them. It's not that I don't love my kids, I do. I adore them. But there are days when I am at my wits end. I just want to sit quietly. I want silence. I just want to talk to someone and not be judged for it. But I can't say these things out aloud.” She looked at my expressionless face and smiled. “Sorry, see? Sometimes it just comes out.”“No problem.” I said and excused myself and left her house without asking for the ingredient I had come for. I had no idea what she was going through and I didn't care.Years later, yesterday she got in touch with me through facebook. With a smiling face, she was being hugged by her three boys and she looked so content and happy.She congratulated me on seeing that I was a now a mother when I told her,“I now understand what you were going through that cold wintry January afternoon. But I am sorry I wasn't of much help that day.”She sent a smiley face and said,“You understand now? That's not possible. Have a set of twins and then we will talk.”I laughed.Hardest part of being a parent is that we are expected to be all sorted out. No mistakes, no grudges, no tiredness. We are judged at the smallest mistake. Parenting doesn't come with a user handbook. If a parent someday just wants to talk their heart out about their kids, that doesn't mean they don't love them. It just means they want someone to listen to them and say it would be alright.","135,510 followers",Hector Quintanilla,15.1K,1.2K,88.5M,2018,https://www.quora.com/We-have-advanced-technologically-over-the-past-several-thousand-years-but-have-we-changed-at-all-as-human-beings
