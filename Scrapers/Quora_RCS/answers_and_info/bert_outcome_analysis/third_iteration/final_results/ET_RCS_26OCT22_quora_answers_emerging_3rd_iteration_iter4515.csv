1,"No.To see that, take out the part between commas, which is a modifier for “Arcom and Mulex.” You get:It invested heavily to acquire Arcom and Mulex in 2012 and 2013, steps into the high-tech laser field.The part beginning “steps into” is a predicate without a subject. It looks like a typesetting error—text that belongs somewhere else on the same page.Does this English expression sound natural? “It invested heavily to acquire Arcom and Mulex in 2012 and 2013, two photoelectric chip technology companies engaged in the advanced laser chip R&D, steps into the high-tech laser field.”","6,972 followers",Kaicheng Liang,16.5K,280,4M,2022,https://www.quora.com/Does-this-English-expression-sound-natural-It-invested-heavily-to-acquire-Arcom-and-Mulex-in-2012-and-2013-two-photoelectric-chip-technology-companies-engaged-in-the-advanced-laser-chip-R-D-steps-into-the-high-tech

Allow me to explain.For India to suddenly become the “strong link” if not the strongest for the western media, all it needs to do are followingWhile India is not some great land, but allowing these would essentially turn India into a far worse place. When a real time of crisis comes, none of these nations of course will come for India’s aid, hell even the Trimurti can’t save India if she ever allows these things.Now I presume the logic of the article is based on the handling of the second wave which was indeed screwed up thanks to a combination of ineptness and overconfidence of Centre and State, giving a fine opportunity to the hyenas of these western media to salivate upon us, considering some were thinking how come people weren’t dying en masse just two months before the crisis hit us. However in times of crisis, whatever help we gave to nations in their crisis hours and our sunshine hours, we got it’s due. At the same time, it did teach us that to be highly suspicious of outsiders. Note that how US was holding back raw materials that was required for vaccine production, even if they didn’t need it.I remember a friend in college telling me - If the Western media starts praising you, then the first thing should be to extremely suspicious about it. Because they don’t praise anyone unless they have something to get from it. I didn’t quite understand it then, later it dawned on me. And it’s a bit funny talking about “weak links”, considering that Indian ruling government is far from having any of their kids hands in gloves with the same people QUAD is fightingReminds me of the term “diya taley andhera” (translation: Darkness below the lamp)So, why should I be bothered by what some western media writes?

What kind of idiots would believe this crap?That said, alliances are not built to compete with each other, but to complement each other. That is how cooperation works, and India’s non alignment policy is still never been an impediment in being allies with both sides in many an international disagreement, whether it is the USA and Russia or USA and Iran, or Israel and Palestine. India is a trusted mediator, for example:Even the Taliban look to cooperate with India:And they even snubbed Pakistan by saying Kashmir is an internal matter of India and won’t take any part in creating trouble there.Much more recently:So if this silly report cites the pandemic situation as some sort of yardstick to measure India’s commitment or importance to the QUAD, I can only think it is written by a person of limited understanding, to be applauded by others with even more severely challenged comprehension.",0 followers,Anna Stepanova,25.5K,201,7.5M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Which-U-S-companies-are-likely-engaged-in-the-research-or-development-of-military-weaponry-or-technology

And by using it, one has to take into consideration, the various factors that it could bring.Inside the ClassroomTeachers hate seeing students with a cellphone in their hands.Outside the ClassroomTry to find interactive websites, or even create interactive presentations/spaces for them to be more immerse.

No one in the village spoke English and, since my friend knew I had an ambitious learning goal, she refused to speak to me in English as well.I set up a routine where I did the same things every day.In the mornings, I woke up and wrote out longhand the regular and irregular verb tables for 1.5-2 hours. I managed to get through an entire pad of paper in two weeks. I still believe that writing things out by hand is the best way to memorize things.While I wrote, I would listen to Michel Thomas' language learning mp3s (I would run for 45-60 minutes in the early afternoon in the French countryside listening to catchy French music. Music is a great way to learn the intonation of a language and train your facial muscles as you sing along.I had lunch with my friend and her French friends everyday. As they refused to slow down when speaking to me in French, it was learn or starve!In the afternoon, if I wasn't playing darts or Boules with my French friends, I was reading ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" in French. Reading the children's books you read as a child is a great hack to learning new languages. Firstly, the language used is simple and secondly, knowing the story helps you to guess the meaning of new words and avoid using a dictionary. Surprisingly children's books are more entertaining in a foreign language.I spent at least an hour writing basic essays about myself which I had my French friend check for errors. When you meet new people you inevitably get asked the same things: ""Where are you from?"", ""What do you do?"", ""Do you like France?"". By learning ready-made answers, you get to practice what you learned and build up your confidence.Another good tip is to learn the filler words. These are the words and phrases people say then all the time between sentences (alors, en fait, etc.) but have no real meaning; allowing you to buy time in a conversation and increase your confidence.After 17 days I left the small town and went to Paris. I met a girl in a coffee shop and we started talking. After a few minutes, she asked how long I had lived in France. When I told her I had been learning French for 17 days, she swore that I had lived in France for at least a year.Hopefully there are some useful tips you can use in your learning.

I think of this as the cheap electronic version of the BritishThe nice thing about basing the paper or project in a discussion area is that I’m there every step of the way interacting with the student. They pick a topic and we discuss it to narrow it down, then define a problem statement. They propose how to address it by posting an outline and I critique that, then they begin to populate a draft outline with references they’ll use in writing and I comment on those. Then they begin populating the outline with draft text and I critique that. By the time the final paper is done I am sure they’ve done the work and they have had my feedback every step of the way.",17 followers,Kruti Naik,1K,361,5.9M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Which-U-S-companies-are-likely-engaged-in-the-research-or-development-of-military-weaponry-or-technology

Your handwriting skills probably suck.So keyboards have more or less destroyed handwriting.Calculators, even on cell phones, have destroyed the ability to do even basic math by hand, or in your head.

Personally, I don’t count any basic math done outside your head as being a skill; knowing a process is not the same as knowing a subject.Using Wikipedia, instead of a paper encyclopedia, has you missing out on a lot of what you would have learned otherwise.Physics or chemistry demonstrations beat the holy heck out of computer simulation of the same. Seeing a pendulum on a screen, vs. seeing a bowling ball on the end of a cable, coming towards your face, are entirely different experiences.Those are just obvious fails of technology in classrooms.","2,186 followers",Mona Jalal,520,187,598.8K,2020,https://www.quora.com/How-are-recruiters-using-smartphone-technology-to-connect-and-engage-with-job-candidates-Is-texting-acceptable
