1,"From the time we climbed out of the trees to use a sharpened stick to dig grubs out of the ground until now when he are talking about splashing the multi-trillion dollar space station into the sea in 2032, “technology” has changed society a great deal. It helped us evolve from tree-climbing creatures whose fingernails have scaled back and whose fingerprints, which allowed us to grip wet tree branches like a Michelin grips the road, have changed as well.The progress of technology has changed society at an increasingly rapid pace, each new advance changing us as a species for better or worse. WeFrom the time we climbed out of the trees to use a sharpened stick to dig grubs out of the ground until now when he are talking about splashing the multi-trillion dollar space station into the sea in 2032, “technology” has changed society a great deal. It helped us evolve from tree-climbing creatures whose fingernails have scaled back and whose fingerprints, which allowed us to grip wet tree branches like a Michelin grips the road, have changed as well.The progress of technology has changed society at an increasingly rapid pace, each new advance changing us as a species for better or worse. We discovered how to make houses on the ground instead of nests in trees; we discovered how to fight off beasts with sticks and fire; we discovered how to plant rather than gather randomly, and that was one of the inflection points that changed us from nomads raping the land to people who husbanded it, and that caused us to be able to make cities, which caused other societies to discover that using that pointed stick for hunting animals or rooting grubs could be used to kill the people who planted the land so they could take the land and the food. Warfare for gain was another change of society from technology and an inflection point.And then someone discovered that if you made charcoal you could melt copper and even iron and that made it easier to kill more people and take their stuff. But along the way it made it easier to plow the land, an event that increased the amount of food that could be produced five fold. And once there was food, there was easy breeding. And still, the average man probably only worked a few hours a week to satisfy his needs for the rest of the week. He had time to ponder and visit with his social clan.And then some idiot looked up at the sky and invented religion because even religion is a sort of technology, no different from television, a tool or machine used to mesmerize and enthrall and control. And once that was established, the entire fulcrum of society shifted with wars being fought over gods as well as for food or for women, which were the main reasons wars were fought.The pace of technology waxed and waned over the centuries until the linchpins of literacy and printing and paper making co-incided. Ships traveled all over the world, or caravans through the desert, contaminating people with new ideas passed back and forth, and new technologies that concatenated and built on each other again and again until we achieved a kind of balance, a kind of world where there was work and there was war and there was food but there was also community through social gathering and religious observance and events that brought people together.But technology strove to make us want more, more, more and as it changed, we were compelled to used the technology of money to buy more things to make our lives not just easier but prettier which meant more time was spent generating money to buy more things than was spent socializing with other people and then social isolation began to increase, and with it unhappiness. Now, instead of spending a few hours a week working hard to satisfy our needs and spending the rest of the time with the community around the fire telling stories and singing, we were working more and more and seeing our families and friends less and less.And then with the advent of television, another inflection point that increased our social isolation. And as religious observance dissipated - we had become religious in name only, no longer attending church or temple, and our volunteer hours helping others declined, we spent more and more time doing less and less and more time alone, watching television, playing on the computer, simulating a society by communicating with people we couldn’t really touch over wires and through radiowaves, becoming more and more isolated and somehow, even with more and more free and happy, we become more and more lonely and depressed.Humans evolved to need and depend on each other, to be social animals, to be sexual creatures, to be bonded by family and friendships and loyalty, duty and honor, and yet all of that was being chipped away as more and more people spent more and more time doing less and less with others and more and more alone. And people accepted it because it was as gradual to us as discovering that a pointy stick that could be used to root for grubs could also be used as a spear to kill animals and a spit to cook them over a fire.And then a pandemic came and people holed up even further from others, alone, in small pods, not being social, not doing community work or engaging in social hobbies and that increased the pace and dependencies on tiny blue-lit screens in their homes and in their hands. Where maybe seventy years earlier, romance and even hook-ups occurred by a chance meeting on a subway car by the meeting of eyes and taking a risk, no one even looks at each other anymore, because they are glued to their screens while the wide world flashes by them outside the window and the love of their life sits five feet away, nose buried in “Words with Friends” and never even aware of what is going on five feet away. But even now, post-pandemic, they will stay home and work remotely, never encountering the barista, the crowds on the platform, the convenience store clerk, the bubbly people in the restaurant at lunch, the drama and tedium of the workplace, chance meetings at the bar after work, that moment with a stranger on the train going home, that coffee hour after church, that social group that hikes mountains or delivers food to the homeless… all disappearing.And the technology that drove it, now drives apps to simulate community; apps for finding “love”; apps for finding sex; apps for confession; apps for advice or therapy or the simulation of community where everyone screams to be heard with ever-increasing false tales of their adventures and wonderful lives or the outrage of their politics.It’s gradual, but technology is leading us to a future where we are increasingly isolated, where “freedom” means the freedom to buy, not to explore because increasingly we do less and less, go out less and less, meet strangers and potential friends less and less. And we get sadder and sadder and more and more angry and we don’t know why.Isolation is the killer of society and we increasingly invent our way to more and more isolation, even expecting love to show up on our doorstep from an app and disappointed when it is not as perfect as the computer we bought from a similar app. And it’s harder to make friends, to choose the right friend rather than any friend, just because we need the social contact, the presence of someone, anyone who says “I hear you” once and awhile no matter how much abuse they heap on us at all the other times, and people we wouldn’t have crossed the street to piss on are now, by default and desperation, becoming part of our increasingly smaller social circle, feeding the cycle of isolation and despair and self-defeat.Once, there was probably a balance, a certain “Camelot” where many, maybe even most, but not “all” people had enough technology to relieve the back-breaking labor of survival but provide the community that lead to real character, real friendship, real love, real community. The balance tipped probably with the advent of radio and then television, the things that kept people from meeting for board games and church socials and the Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks who gathered to plant flowers on the town common so that the community could gather to hear concerts on Saturday after a pot luck where Jimmy met Janey and fell in love. To be sure, those things still sometimes happen, but they happen less and less and the flowers int he town square are gone because no one wants to plant them and the bandstand on the town common is empty because no one can be bothered to leave their screens to enjoy it and the subway trains are empty because everyone is afraid to catch a virus.Technology changed us at every stage of discovery, from the ability to carve wood with a sharp rock to the ability to send rockets into space. But at some point it has moved from beneficent to malevolent, making life easier physically but harder emotionally, increasing isolation, or as Zager and Evans predicted in their dystopian song “2525”, “You’ll pick your sons, pick your daughters, too… from the bottom of a long dark tube” because intimacy is gone, lost to isolation, desolation, despair and loneliness. At one time technology served to make life better, but like many things, some is good so we believe more is better, but it’s not always true and yet we are on the treadmill now, moving automatically, to a time when we can live without any social contact, without meeting people, without any random touch or look or glance and so much of life is lost, lost, lost, even as the population grows.We have lost the balance, the balance between technology serving community and technology eliminating community because I do not believe for a minute that the online “community” is real. It’s a chimera and those people we love on screen can just as easily be the Craigslist Killer in real life and yet we willingly, out of desperation for contact and to be heard, rush to press the flesh of a warm human being regardless of mutual values or character or interests but just because we are lonely and isolated.","7,036 followers",Rob Ennals,671,130,3.1M,2022,https://www.quora.com/In-what-way-can-technology-change-society

4,Most of the circulating part of the lot in exchanges are generally kept in cold storage and thus no impact to a larger portion of it.Personal Wallets are safe as you know you can even save your key even on a paper.I would say there wouldn't be a major impact yet the transactions being processed at the instant of outage could be impacted and there could be loss of funds.Please note I am still a novice in crypto world and would definitely like to correct myself if the above statements are not correct.,5 followers,Russell Woodrow,634,0,0,2017,https://www.quora.com/In-what-way-can-technology-change-society
5,"I think your question is ill informed.Mining especially Bitcoin requires internet, electricity, and ASIC hardware to mine. There’s a physical cost in terms of space, physical cost of funds to buy, etc. Bitcoin has a finite max supply. Its a deflationary cryptocurrency that is an interesting financial experiment. It certainly has more trust from many people than the fiat money system like the US Dollar that can print trillions of dollars at will encouraging potential rampant inflation.",0 followers,Patrick Celaya,4.4K,64,4M,2021,https://www.quora.com/In-what-way-can-technology-change-society
