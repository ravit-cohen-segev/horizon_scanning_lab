Carriers are expensive things that take a lot of hard-learned (and for the USN, hard-won) experience to build and runFor Cold War-era Soviet Russia, that cost was generally deemed too expensive. For current-day China, that cost has been deemed acceptable, and they’re going about the process of getting their own blue-water carrier fleet ready. It’s not going to be anywhere near as good as the USN is, at least not for a long time- which is part of why the Chinese (and the Russians) have long been interested in alternatives- like AShBMs or the Russian Bazalt/Granit/Vulkan families of long-range anti-ship weapons, and the US has not.When you’re the premier,","20,087 followers",Ben Kolber,27.6K,324,21.6M,2018,https://www.quora.com/How-far-ahead-is-the-US-compared-to-the-rest-of-the-world-in-Military-Technology

Since the beginning of time, the Russian does not like to venture far from home. This actually applies to all Slav nations.The USA like a true Anglo Saxon loves going far and wide, spreading their power far abroad creating “allies” in the same way the British, Dutch,French and Germans did at the ending of the 19th and start of the 20th centuries.For this the U.S. really does not need a very powerful defence system. After all, who is going to invade them? So research goes more into offensive weaponry.Now research, development and purchase of new systems. The US had reached the pinnacle of development for its role of spreading its world dominance. After all, no one the U.S. forces met on the field have anything near that of the Americans. Again there are no plans for fighting Russians. It's a big no no that can quickly reach nuclear.For this reason, majority of the US’s world largest military expenditure is for maintaining the massive military spread out across the world.Russia on the other hand still works to develop weapons to ensure that the west does not think of once again invading. After all, every time they let their guard down, they were invaded from the west.Russia uses a larger percentage of their military expenditure on research and development than the U.S.So here it is. This is not in any way superiorto this.A carrier is only needed by those armies that stray away from home. So the US had invested in them a lot. Russia has no need for them whatsoever,and would probably build any more only as a luxury. They can reach any country in the northern hemisphere from the thousands of airfields at home.So what do the Russians need? They need weaponry that would annihilate a carrier group if it is used against them. They invest and develop coastal defence and antiship missiles that overtime had become superior to anything the U.S. has. And are still working on better ones.TheThey had become masters in hypersonic antiship missiles.TheThis practice of countering faster advancing U.S. surface ships had allowed Russia to balance the playing field at a fraction of the cost. Even during the Soviet era.VA-111 ShkvalThe Russians had always favoured Submarines to a surface navy. They had produced over time some of the most deadly ballistic and attack submarines.The recent reincarnation are among the deadliest in the world.The most important feature of a good attack sub is to be undetectable as to sneak up on its prey. You can not get quieter than the new Kilo class subs, which has been nicknamed “black hole” by the westIt was reported that it successfully shadowed both British and American carriers on test runs. On an NATO attack on Syria, It prevented the British submarine sent into the area for the attack from firing its missiles. By shadowing it.Similarly when it comes to air supremacy, both produce incredible aircraft. We will not go into comparing them here. However, once again the U.S. has the numbers, while Russian has the ability of shooting them down cheaply if ever used against them.Russian air defence works in an interlinked network involving,Long to short range SAM systems like theMedium to short range like theAnd terminal phase interception likeThis allows Russia to provide airspace deniability with the ability to pick and choose what to shoot down with what. While protecting each other.In case of Nuclear deterrence, Russia keeps working to make sure any missile sheild used to try and disable its ability to retaliate and therefore upset MAD is ineffective. As a result, while the Western deterrence has been stagnant for years, Russian ICBMs are at least two generations ahead. TheThey had also developed other alternative delivery systems like theandRussia is certainly not backward on the ground forces department either. Again mastering missile technology. In addition to almost all its missile systems be it coastal and naval, having the capability to be used against ground targets, Russians have theVery effectively used in Georgia and Syria. This is just a snapshot. Having massive budget and massive numbers, does not mean you can match into any where. This is because some other are specializing in neutralizing you at the cheap.Russian combat vehicles and tanks can stand their own in any battle field. TheIs an interesting concept of various fighting vehicles with interchangeable parts.They also take a well tested concept and update it to be comparable to their more modern weapons. Like the T72 of which Russia has thousands still in bubble wraps, and making the T72M3s out of them.As for the smaller and infantry based weapons, well it depends on individual preferenceEdit:I will clarify those points and will not address them in the comments any more.You do not have to do a combat test to know a weapon works. It will work just as well on a test ground. None the less, Russia used its new weapon systems in Syria. From cruise missiles to the tank drones.Even their Electronic warfare weapons. Another field in the military industry that they outdone others. Like theTheWhat was cancelled was theSide note: Stealth in its present form was invented in the USSR in the 60s byTheRussia has thousands of brand new T72 in storage. They had decided to upgrade them to T72M3 which is much cheaper than building a new Tank. The T72M3 has the same features with the T90.In Russia, a term is used “near abroad” and signifies countries very near the Russian borders. That is where the Russian interest lies.

By technology we can think of things like “missile technology” or “rocket propulsion technology” etc.I will answer with what comes to my mind and I might miss some things and get others wrong but I’ll try.For instance we have air to air missiles. Europeans are currently developing Meteor missile which reached initial operating capability (IOC) less than a month ago.What is publicly known is that the missile has a ramjet propulsion system and can reach speeds of over 4 mach.According to MBDA, Meteor has three to six times the kinematic performance of current air-air missiles of its type. The key to Meteor's performance is a throttleable ducted rocket (Meteor (missile)Here’s an article claiming that Meteor is in fact the best air to air missile.The Best Air-to-Air Missile in the World Is in Sweden — War Is BoringAssuming this public information is correct and I don’t see why it wouldn’t be - Europeans are ahead of US at the moment with their air to air Meteor missile which was developed over concern for Russia’s R-77 Vympel ramjet missile and according to some sources Meteor missile was built to “wipe the table clear of all opposition”.M777 howitzer is actually designed by BAE (UK).It was immediately widely adopted by US Army and US Marine Corps as well as Canadian Army and Australian Army.The lighter weight and smaller size allows the M777 to be transported by theM777 howitzerAMOS mortar system is joint design by Sweden and Finland.AMOSWhen fitted to a vehicle, bothAMOSGotland class attack submarine originates from Sweden.It is said to be the world’s quietest submarine.TheOn the water surface, the submarine is powered by two sets ofThis capability had previously only been available withGotland-class submarineThe secret to the world’s most silent submarineArcher Artillery System is also from Sweden, it’s dubbed as the world’s fastest howitzer.It uses a Swedish howitzer system that has far superior performance against for instance the M109.The system is designed for high strategic, operational and tactical mobility. The vehicle can reach road-speeds of up to 70Archer Artillery SystemHaubits FH77And this one.. Leopard 2A6. I’m sorry, almost everyone I respect has the authority says it is superior to the beloved Abrams. It’s developed in Germany.It is said that it’s tungsten penetrators have superior accuracy and velocity and superior penetration capabilities due to tungsten’s higher melting point in comparison to depleted uranium.Leopard 2Prathamesh KulkarniIt is the world's fastest anti-shipThe missile travels at speeds ofThe land-launched and ship-launched versions are already in service, with the air and submarine-launched versions currently in the testing phase.An air-launched variant of BrahMos is planned which came out in 2012. ABrahMosThere may be more but I can’t come up with any at the moment, I may update this answer if I have the time and come up with or am recommended new systems and technologies.Things like Electronic Warfare systems etc. are hard to compare, they’re being developed around the world and especially Europe has a very competent high technology cluster that offers a serious rivalry to any US based companies while struggling with but a fraction of the funding that the US ones receive.Luckily for Americans and Europeans we’re all friends and we’ll sell each other anything we can make better than the other - provided they’ll want to buy it that is. Sometimes it is chosen to buy domestic just to support the industry.There are a lot of technologies and systems used by militaries andThey might already be immersed into countless engineering sites online and imagining whole new technologies and solutions.

Because outside of stuff developed by DARPA, most of the really modern military stuff is civilian made stuff that has been tweaked, upgraded, and/or ruggedized for military use.The only place you can legitimately say that the military is largely ahead of civilians is traumatic wound care. Most modern lifesaving trauma care is pioneered by the military. How could that be, you ask? Well, when it comes to saving troops who are bleeding out from IED strikes, military doctors don't give a shit about approved treatments if the options are down to definitely-dead-grunt or snowball's-chance-in-hell-of-live grunt-if-I-try-this.

Supposedly, this technology was used to help cripple the Iraqi air defense system when the US invaded.This was important to Cisco because we were working in security and cryptography and the NSA was forever trying to get us to corrupt our products so they could un-encrypt foreign transmissions on the fly. One time we were required to corrupt product that had been shipped to China and it started a major debate about our fiduciary responsibility to the country or to the customer. The issue was that if you sell a security product that you know is corrupted, you are knowingly committing fraud and are liable. As the Product Manager at the time I asked the NSA if they would stand behind us (and me as I might be personally liable) in court if we were discovered. Of course the answer from the NSA was “Hell no.”We were on our own. We then entered into a long debate about how to detect Easter eggs and other corruption introduced into security products unknowingly through another vendor’s corrupted hardware. The issue was never resolved but it should be known that our security source code HAD to be provided to the NSA in order to get FIPS certification and they made certain changes to it.So to answer your question, USA military technology is advanced far beyond anyone’s knowledge to describe the extent.On the other hand, the Chinese probably know more about our technology than we do since they perpetrated the greatest security breach in history by compromising the RSA key technology used by almost everyone in the world.

Even though it can be hard to get a leg up over the Americans (even with 3 or 4 countries (UK, France, Russia, China) trying to out do them they can still compete in a market on all fronts against all of them. However the best way to view it is this, one of those countries above will bring out a new weapon such as a tank or warship that will be the ever in the world, then 5 or 10 years later a new American tank or warship will come out that is better, then the next warship or tank will be released by another country and then the next making a leap frog effect of military technology an example being the Royal navies type 45 destroyer having advantages over an Arleigh Burke but then being outdone by the US navies  Zumwalt destroyer.Another thing that is worthy of mention and note is the F22, when it came out it introduced a lot of new and advanced technologies, a lot of these were highly publicised to show off the capability of the new and advanced plane (stealth features, Thrust vectoring, advanced computer and guidance systems), when these became public knowledge they were copied by the competitors which is why there is a striking similarity between the F22 and",UNKNOWN,Zack,759,62,2.2M,2016,https://www.quora.com/How-far-ahead-is-the-US-compared-to-the-rest-of-the-world-in-Military-Technology

Since then, all I kept wondering was when we Indians will be able to create something as miraculous as Google.However, after working in product-based companies and having done multiple startups it allowed me to understand the software industry and howWith Indians filling the executive ranks at so many western establishments like Google Inc CEO Sundar Pichai, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, and Adobe chief Shantanu Narayen, a majority of Indians raised questions about India’s own technology ambitions wondering why India hasn’t innovated something yet.Related Read:They say, ‘we are a country of 1.2 billion people while the US is just a country of more than 300 million people’. With such a huge population, why can’t India create something as big as a Microsoft, Google, or Apple?Witnessing their confusion, I feel they aren’t aware of the entire issue. It has not been projected to them in the right manner. Here are the reasons that might clear this air of inquisitiveness and confusion:1. We follow the saying ‘Necessity is the mother of all inventions’We belong to a third world country, where our problems and issues are thoroughly different as compared to any developed or first world countries. So when your problems are different, the solutions will also be different.Having a population of 1.2 billion people doesn’t mean one can create the next Google, Microsoft or Apple. Solutions will be based on the problems that a particular country is facing and not the size of its population.RedBus is a perfect example of this statement. It was innovated to solve the problem of booking bus seats and the way we have been commuting in the country.Apart from this, there are other factors like how the innovative entrepreneurial talent is being accepted by the society, what sort of exposure they have and the amount of funds being allotted to them.Globalization in India has brought financial freedom among the people. With the arrival of financial freedom, we witnessed a tremendous financial boom in the middle-class society.They started shifting to upper middle-class and the rich became elite. In India, startups only target the lower middle-class, middle-class or the upper middle-class people because they are the actual consumers affected by any problem. That is the reason Indian startups like Zomato, Ola, Paytm, Flipkart became a hit.2. Right now India is in 2000’s of USAGlobalization entered the US in the 1970s, which makes it evident that India is way behind these superpowers in terms of development. Their necessities are our luxuries, which makes it obvious that their startups will be different than ours.For instance, when Apple started in 1983, we in India didn’t even have a proper electronic industry. When Ford started in the 1950s, India had just got its independence. We couldn’t have expected companies like these out of our country at that period as they were trying to develop some solution for their country.These companies eventually evolved to become really big and started expanding to other geographical boundaries to emerge as multinational companies.It’s not that Indians are lacking in skill sets required to create billion dollars companies. We have had some of the brightest tech minds in the world to create a global revolution, but we have local problems to solve focusing our nation.Related Read:This means we too can create global tech giants, but keeping our market necessities and strengths into consideration we have created Infosys, TCS, Wipro and many other service giants.3. Acceptance ratio is lowIn general selling a product is tough, selling in India is very tough. New initiatives in technology sectors were always lagging in India due to the lack of early adopters.Remember MySpace? The huge social networking site once upon a time that got to the scene ahead of Facebook, lost big when Mark Zuckerberg introduced Facebook.Similar was the story of WhatsApp, which took off big time and over powered Skype and chat messenger in a very short span. Few other examples are Airbnb world’s biggest p2p platform for renting homes, Snapchat where primary chatting format is through pictures.Had these platforms been created in India, people of the country would have been skeptical in registering in them thinking they would have to share their personal details or contacts from the phone or allowing strangers into their home.This suggests that the acceptance ratio for these sort of products is extremely high in the USA than India.4.Why India is not ChinaWe have been hearing numerous times thatThe Chinese government banned Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Google, whatsapp etc giving space to local players like Sina, Baidu , wechat and Tencent to develop into billion dollars companies. Due to their government policies, China is able to do few things.If government policies allow, Indian technologists can also be far ahead of any other developed country and a Google can be created in no time. Google of India is Google, Facebook of India is Facebook, Whatsapp of India is Whatsapp, this need to be changed for a better and stronger Indian economy.Related Read:5. Once upon a time, Indian Government wasn’t keen towards making India a manufacturing hubToday, India is home to some of the world’s most brilliant technical minds, most innovative start-ups and a growing collective of venture firms. However, there was a time when global companies were hesitant in coming to India, citing several regulatory problems inherent to the region.With hardly any government support, global companies were facing permission issues in India. On the other hand, the Chinese government was allowing the foreign companies to set up an industry in no time. With everything in place and production cost extremely less in china, getting a product manufactured in that country is actually a child’s play.Prime Minister Narendra Modi realized that to start the engines of progress, he has to take a major leap and thus intervened with his campaign Make in India wherein an MNC can come to India and set up a business in a very short span.6.We Indians have a ‘Services’ mindsetIndia developed Slideshare, the only well-known global startup from India. So why bringing a technology company out of India is actually difficult? And why a majority of companies are only coming out of Europe or the USA?The reason is technology, which is the core of any startup. India’s tech industry is built largely around outsourcing giants like Wipro, TCS, and Infosys. Much of the work they do involves programming and coding of products designed elsewhere.As India is dominated by service-based industries, a majority of people want to be in the hierarchy and become managers, allocating the work to his/her subordinates rather than staying in core technology field. People wanting to go into the technical stream are very less.Related Read:Moreover, in our country, it takes extreme guts to go against the societal pressures to pursue a business opportunity without a steady income. Such an environment makes it even more difficult to channel the energies towards innovation.Fortunately, times are changing and India is now becoming the largest tech incubator in Asia, the third-biggest in the world, and it’s on track to become the global leader. With such tremendous progress, we have a lot to celebrate.Current generation is giving a new hope for a better India, in recent past we see a lot of early adaptors for different products and services that were being launched. So it’s not that India couldn’t create tech giants If it would have been a necessity, we could have created it long back.",256 followers,Priyal Gupta,9.7K,0,0,2018,https://www.quora.com/How-far-ahead-is-the-US-compared-to-the-rest-of-the-world-in-Military-Technology

This is basically your own R&D, I would say.Lastly, I would say to look for the technology you’ll be working on. Many are lucky to work on the latest tech & have more growth. While some go out & work on the obsolete ones (desktop based apps) which can affect you in long run (IF you want to switch in the career), as there’ll be less options for you in the market.So, to conclude. If you like the policy of a company, you find the work culture as good & you are excited to work on the project… then it’s a good & top tech company for you :)","5,360 followers",Valerio Cietto,677,2.4K,9.1M,2021,https://www.quora.com/How-far-ahead-is-the-US-compared-to-the-rest-of-the-world-in-Military-Technology

Here we will see the top 3 technologies that will advance and emerge in this field with the upcoming industry trend.Hadoop has been widely adopted by enterprises for their data warehouse needs in the past years. The trend is growing and will continue to do so in the coming years. The companies that have not yet figured the advantages of Hadoop will soon explore their uses and applications. If we see the aspects of technological advancements then Hadoop will continue to come up with a variety of features that would make various enterprises ready. After Hadoop gains stability, its implementation will expand across many sectors and also companies that will be able to use the solutions without much security concerns.Almost all the companies are now using big data in order to store and process Big data. The only difference that will be seen is how fast they can deliver the analytical solutions for coming up with better business decisions. The main focus will be speed, how can the processing capabilities increase. We will be witnessing companies use real-world applications from these technologies.With the Internet of Things (IoT) taking the first seat, we are witnessing the increase in the generation of data. There are various applications of IoT that will be great for managing huge volumes of data. Cloud services will help serve better.

Below is one such cartoon, just for fun.Finding an 'effective' data scientist is hard and finding people who understand who a data scientist is equally hard. Note the use of 'effective' here, I use it to highlight that there could be people who might possess some of these skills yet may not be the best fit in a data science role. Irony is that even the people looking for hiring data scientists do not know who a data scientist is. Hiring managers post job descriptions for traditional data analyst and business analyst roles while the title calling it a 'Data Scientist' role.Everything that I say below is my experience working in a data scientist role with a major search engine and advertising platform. Instead of giving a bullet list of skills, I would first highlight the difference between some data related roles.Consider the following scenario. Shop-Mart and Bulk-Mart are two competitors in selling retail. Some higher up in the management chain asks this question: ""How many Shop-Mart customers also go to Bulk-Mart?"".[Please note that the question might be of interest to Bulk-Mart management or even a third party, possibly a market research or consumer behavior company, interested in shopping behavior of the population.]Here is how different data-related roles will approach the problem. ThisTraditional BI/Reporting Professional:Data Analyst:Business Analyst:Data Mining or Big Data Engineer:Statistician (A traditional one):Program/Project Manager:Now putting it altogether.The rise of online services has brought a paradigm shift in software development life cycle and how business iterate over successive features and products. Having a different data puller, analyst, statistician and project manager is just now possible any more. The mantra now is ship, experiment and learn, adapt, ship, experiment and learn .... This situation has resulted in the birth of a new role - ' A Data Scientist'A data scientist should have the skills of all the individuals I have mentioned so far. In addition to the skills mentioned above, a data scientist should have rapid prototyping and programming, machine learning, visualization and hacking skills.Domain Knowledge and Soft Skills Are As Important as Technical Skills:All of what I have said above is based on my own tenure as a data scientist at a major search engine and later the advertising platform within the same company. I learnt that sometimes people asking the question may not know what they want to know - sounds preposterous - yet happens way too often. Very often a bozo will start rat holing into something that is not related to the issue at hand - just to prove that he/she is relevant. A data scientist encounters such HIPPOS (Highly Paid Person's Opinion) that are somewhat unrelated to the problem if not complete nonsense very often. A data scientist should posses the right soft skills to manage situations where people ask irrelevant, distracting or outside of scope questions. This is hard, especially in situations where the person asking the question is several levels up in the corporate ladder and is known to have an ego. It is a data scientist's responsibility to manage up and around while presenting and communicating insights.Below is a summary of necessary skills a data scientist should possess in my opinion.Curiosity About Data and Passion for Domain:Soft Skills:Being a good story teller is also something that helps. Sometimes the insights obtained from data are counter-intuitive, if you are not a good story teller, it will be difficult to convince your audience.Math/Theory:CS/Programming:Big Data and Distributed Systems:Visualization:Below is a visualization of high level description of skills needed to become a data scientist.Where is a data scientist in the big data pipeline?To be continued .....","26,878 followers",Rohit Malshe,1.3K,327,11.4M,2014,https://www.quora.com/How-far-ahead-is-the-US-compared-to-the-rest-of-the-world-in-Military-Technology

Along withFor the longest time, people have been planning their vacations by walking into a well-stocked room surrounded by maps and brochures. Greeted by an agent offering a cup of coffee, they would begin the discussion about budgets and desired experiences. When online travel agencies started slowly but surely replacing traditional shops in 2005, Internet-adept travelers had learned to book their trips on their home PC. And now it seems like no one ever visits brick-and-mortar agencies anymore. But that’s far from true.A recent study shows that offline agents save customers $452 per trip. Along with cost-saving, travellers spend less time researching – a process that often takes days and a dozen visited websites. Travel agents also still dominate cruise and tour sales. Research Travel Agents vs. Online Booking showed that about 65 per cent of American respondents prefer booking international trips with an agent, even if they think online booking is cheaper. Many travellers feel more secure planning with an expert than using self-service websites.Still, the convenience of using OTAs often tends to overpower travel agencies’ appeal. Undeniably, there’s still a market for good, old travel agents. But it doesn’t mean that current agencies should do business the same way they did decades ago. Digital transformation is shifting the focus and allowing companies to combine the benefits of travel agents with the convenience of self-service platforms.
