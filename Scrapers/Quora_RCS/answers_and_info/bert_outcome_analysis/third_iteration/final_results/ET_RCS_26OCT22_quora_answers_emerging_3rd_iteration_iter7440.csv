Kindly note, that I have a bold prediction to make for the year 2022. That prediction is that 2022 is the year that marks the end of the crypto bubble. Bitcoin which today trades at around $45,000 will fall below $15000 this year. One more point on the Bitcoin bubble.Can the bubble be saved and continue to fly?What conditions can save the bubble?Please note, that only and only the federal reserve can save the Bitcoin bubble. That too by printing more money. There is absolutely no other way to save this bubble. The second thing which is needed to save the bubble is the cumulative cluelessness of individuals who think that the bubble can survive without external support from the central bank and can continue to rise.Overall my prediction is that the crypto bubble along with the speculators of the stock market are going to be vanquished and everyone who thinks that the bubble is endless is going to get wiped out. Tesla stock also is going to be brought back to earth. Though the collapse in stock prices will not be like the crypto bubble as it is regulated but still the way how the global economies are placed with regards to inflation and the current situation between Russia and Ukraine things are ominously staked against the stock market indices. The stock indices can only rise till the time people can happily sustain and survive the ever surging inflation. Oil has dropped due to the hard lockdowns in China.The other issue is the clear inversion of the yield curve in the US along with the federal reserve nearly on its knees to run and raise rates to save its face can only mean one thing and that is that a new stagflationary recession is on its way. This will happen because if rates are not raised dramatically and are only raised slowly as in by 25 basis points then such a raise will have nearly no impact on the upward trajectory of inflation. The prices will still continue to rise till the time rates aren’t raised to appropriate levels.The funny part here is that once the federal reserve tries to save its face and tries to fight against inflation then it might cause an even bigger problem by breaking the bond market which is in a bubble. What a disaster we have on our hands. All thanks to the great financial experts of these banks. The only thing which can save them is by printing more.I mean this printing is like a drug. First, you need x quantity of the same. The next time 2x and then it continues endlessly. When you tell people that it can all break as we are going through epic levels of geopolitical mess. One simple example is the war in Ukraine where we are getting the news that Russia might use phosphorous weapons to attack Ukraine. The second example is the hard lockdown in Shanghai, China where people are screaming for their lives. The third example is the chaos in Sri Lanka. Though I accept that all these things don’t affect the stock markets directly but still. The writing is already on the wall and something has to give.What I feel is going to end this crypto bubble is the aggressive stance of the federal reserve to clamp down on free money by raising rates. This they will have to do forcefully when once the inflation mess starts percolating in wages globally. That precisely means we reach a stage where the working class starts demanding higher wages to work for companies which the companies will obviously deny as their profits margins are going to get destroyed. That stage when inflation becomes nearly unbearable and wage inflation also starts picking up like there is no tomorrow will be the stage when suddenly the crypto bubble will come crashing down. The news media like always will be late and will enter the party when it’s all over. So do remember I am repeating one fact about bubbles again :Bubbles never trade sideways. Bitcoin is already trading below crucial support levels of $45000.The end of the bubble is near. I am trying to project what will happen with this speculative bubble when once the free money supply ends and the fed reduces its balance sheet aggressively. There will not be any place to hide than for people holding this speculative token which is based on 100% faith. Easy money, lower rates, stimulus checks, and aggressive betting have all helped in the creation of this bubble. As per my understanding, the end of the bubble is near and it will not happen with any warning signs.I am saying this because I have a lot of faith in the failed financial policy of the federal reserve that even with 50-year high inflation they might yet come out with another $3 trillion USD stimulus package to help the bubble economy live for a few more months. Such is the level of incompetence. Do also note, that during all this time the living standard of the people of US continues to fall drastically. As more printing will continue to increase the tax burden on US citizens pushing them to the brink. If you think that what I write is baseless then just go and check the date of release of the first stimulus package by Mr Trump when the initial Covid19 panic broke i.e., during March-Apr of ‘20. You will be surprised to see that it was near the same time when this betting token in Bitcoin started giving break out signals which can be seen and verified by anyone with the most basic financial market understanding.Disclaimer",0 followers,Randy Pratt,818,633,3.5M,2021,https://www.quora.com/How-would-a-stock-market-crash-affect-the-cryptocurrency-market-1

There is no accurate accountability of just how many US citizens or other nation’s are in crypto currencies. It is all quite obscure at this time and most data is a guesstimate.However, crypto currency markets are still very small in relation to stocks, bonds, real estate, etc. It is still a small segment of the financial investment markets. It is also still highly volatile with price swings that are more severe than any stock market crash so far.What I am trying to say is crypto is just another type of investing instrument. It is popular with a certain type of individual but it is not yet mainstream, despite the massive attention it gets from the news companies.Studying the technical patterns between crypto price surges and speculation and sudden collapses of crypto price, there is no correlation with what is going on with stocks and stock derivatives. At this time, there appears to be no impact on the stock market. That may change and I am sure that crypto lovers will argue this analysis. But remember the stock market trades 220 billion dollars every DAY.

4,"While cryptocurrencies have not been around long enough for us to develop an idea of what their historical correlation to equities might be, I can speculate with some confidence that the answer is probably “no,” and here’s why:When the stock market crashes, it will be destroying two critical things:Both of those things are requiredWhile cryptocurrencies have not been around long enough for us to develop an idea of what their historical correlation to equities might be, I can speculate with some confidence that the answer is probably “no,” and here’s why:When the stock market crashes, it will be destroying two critical things:Both of those things are requiredFrankly, though, I think confidence will be just as big a factor, if not bigger. Cryptocurrencies are the “new kid on the block,” so it’s unlikely that old school investors/traders (such as myself) would seek out crypto as any kind of “safe haven” in a broad market crash. To the contrary: The first thing to go on sale when confidence evaporates are speculative assets — and cryptocurrencies are still considered highly speculative by most of us. (I steer clear of cryptocurrencies even now, and tend to think of them as a “passing fad.”)Further, while things like gold are traditional safe-havens in market crashes, part of the key understanding lies in the word itself:And keep in mind that even gold itself, a “traditional” safe-haven, fell roughly 30% from March 2008 until October 2008. I can only imagine how much worse a highly-speculative, highly-volatile asset class such as cryptocurrencies would perform.The truth is, all we can do is speculate, since cryptos weren’t around for the last market crash.But try this thought experiment:Especially knowing that if your fund gets wiped out, you’re later going to be hauled in front of various committees (and potentially even face legal action) and that you will have to repeatedly justify exactly WHY you chose to gamble on a completely untested asset class during a major time of crisis —I wouldn’t.",6 followers,Ryan Burner,1.6K,0,0,2018,https://www.quora.com/How-would-a-stock-market-crash-affect-the-cryptocurrency-market-1

You need to watch out for those things. I will mention some of them below and I believe you will get other reasonable answers from other comments tooWrong reasons for tradingThe major reason cryptocurrency trading might be unsafe for you is that you are trading for the wrong reasons. The fake lives portrayed by some so-called crypto celebs on Instagram inspire most people to also want to make a fortune in a short time. They open crypto trading accounts and start to use a lot of leverage without even knowing about the market. Many of them lose their money and quit trading within just one year of trying. This is also the reason why we have a lot of retail traders who quit trading.My solutionI suggest you take your time to master the market. Understand that you will not make a lot of money once. Some people indeed have been lucky to trade at some magic moment, but those are usually once-in-a-lifetime opportunities that often do not happen. Real market success takes time, and it is a product of continuous work and patience;Zero trading planYou cannot trade successfully without a trading plan. It is not safe to do that at all. A trading plan is made up of your trading strategy, which has your entry and exit rules, the amount you want to risk per trade, your profit and loss ratio, when to stop trading, how many trades you take per day, and many more. You should create your trading plan to suit your personality. The trading plan will help you to decide if you want to scalp or work with higher timeframes and how much leverage you want to trade with.My solutionI would advise that you take your time to understand yourself and create a proven trading plan. You can try to practice with a reliable broker, like Solidecn. You can choose to make a little deposit or use the demo account. Don’t worry; the demo account also has live trading features, so it is suitable for learning.Bad brokerage serviceNot choosing the right crypto broker could also go against your trades. Brokers with large spreads and fees will take a lot of money away from your profit in the long run. Some brokers also have bad trading conditions that won’t be favorable to your trade. You can choose a broker based on recommendations from people you trust. You can also use my broker, Solidecn. Don’t worry, you can check for reviews to verify what people say about Solidecn.My solutionI would recommend Solidecn because I have been trading there for a while, and I have had one of the best crypto trading experiences on the platform. The execution is very fast, and the broker has different accounts to cover various clients’ needs. The broker only charges a little commission on my trades, and so far, that seems to be the only fee. The commission is around $3 for $100,000 traded – it is far below the industry average. Minting fees are charges on withdrawal, but it is not a big deal – you won't notice it. The customer support always replies, and the trading conditions are high standard conditions.",UNKNOWN,"L.

Other cryptocurrencies quickly followed, with several of the mainstream coins seeing a huge drop in value.Bitcoin has played a significant and leading role in the cryptocurrency community. Being the first to arrive on the scene, the Mother Coin has maintained its top position by market capitalization and is worth a healthy chunk of the whole crypto industry.As a result of this sustained dominance, when Bitcoin appreciates or depreciates, it has a ripple effect on other cryptocurrencies. It is observed that altcoins shed or gain value, sometimes more than Bitcoin itself. Bitcoin’s dominance in the market makes it a frequent catalyst for volatility in the crypto industry.The price of Bitcoin has dropped 21.92% in the past 24 hours, and 38.78% since this time last week.The currency is currently valued at $34,214.30, down almost 50% since highs of $64,000 in April. Other popular cryptocurrencies including Ethereum, Binance, Cardano, Dogecoin and XRP are all also seeing values plummet. The broad-based gains seen on Tuesday have eroded sharply today as bigger and smaller cryptocurrencies faced sell-off pressure.In addition, the sell-off witnessed in the cryptocurrency market has been triggered by uncertainties over inflation, which has prompted investors to reduce exposure to riskier assets.Another factor that has weighed on digital coins was the Chinese ban on financial institutions providing services related to cryptocurrency transactions.This is why you should not hold. Many people have lost there crypto investments now that the market is down due to hodling. Trading is far more profitable and with trading, you will not be making any losses despite the drop in crypto prices recently.Owning and holdling crypto is risky and not enough but investing it and trading it to earn more and increase your portfolio is of paramount important.sWhile the markets are tanking, this provides a perfect opportunity to load up some long-term bags!
