So while the ENTJ may be less grand and revolutionary in their visions than the INTJ, they still are more likely to turn what they do come up with into reality.Ti-Fe is more contemplative than action oriented. They change the world more through insights than action. In that sense I guess one might say that they still change the world just as much as Te-Fi types.

If anything I would just argue that any type may change the world, but Si is less concerned with re-imagining and more concerned with what already works, though they can usually perfect that which works to a much higher degree, and Ne is usually too distracted and bouncy to come up with visions the way Ni does; Ne is more interested in just exploring new ppssibilities than in solidifying a comprehensive vision. Maybe coming up with a plethora of half baked ideas but rarely something wholistic. Se definitely capitalizes on opportunities, is the most entrepreneurial (not Ne) and makes the most of the here and now which can sometimes lead to really impressive outcomes, but massive change is not really the goal so much as making the most out of what exists. and Fi is more concerned on simply focusing on what the Fi type cares about more than the “how do I change the world?” part.That said, I'm pretty sure every type has a member who's changed the world in some way, and type doesn't have a huge influence over this.ENTP: Richard FeynmanINTP: Abraham LincolnENFP: Walt DisneyINFP: George OrwellENFJ: Martin Luther King Jr.INFJ: GandhiESTJ: Henry FordISTJ: George WashingtonESFJ: Andrew CarnegieISFJ: Rosa ParksESTP: Thomas EdisonISTP: Steve JobsESFP: Bill Clinton and Ronald ReaganISFP: Ulysses S.

Dumped an ashtray full of cigarette butts and pizza toppings on top of his smartass, and verbalized my issues, with earbuds in, so he couldn’t interrupt me. Worked? Like a charm.My ENFP soulmates? Female? One has brain damage (and accepts the boundaries I set). The other knows exactly how to communicate with me, almost telepathically, after nearly 30 years of ups and downs, those downs being in my unsure youth.I date a lot of ENTJs (well, I don’t date a lot, but they’re the bulk of it). I love hearing them speak. It’s amazing.But other INTJs? Holy shit. An INTJ, who has a moment of understanding, has this ‘look’ in his/her eyes. I say something direct. They connect a million dots. TRUE telepathy.My INTJ father, when I forced him to make a doctor’s appointment he NEEDED to make, but likes to let shit go until he’s absolutely miserable. He was asleep after a procedure, and I spoke with the doctor. This next procedure WILL be done, it’s necessary. He made the appointment, after a moment of me expounding facts, and him “dot connecting”. I saw that moment in his eyes.An INTJ physician friend of mine, whom I’ve never spoken much around, understanding exactly what I meant when I began tipping my hand about how I had to self diagnose to save my own life, and I said “a lipoma forming at the first point of neural tube fusion…”I saw in his eyes, he never realized I had a deep brain. He knew exactly what I was getting at, he knew all about my lumbar issues, seizures, and cervical spinal cord compression. We smoke pot and get philosophical, but usually, I listen to HIS “out-loud thoughts”. He’s never seen me in quite the same light.My female INTJ friend, who also has neurological issues. The only person who would calmly slide beneath my skin and sooth me while I was having a seizure at work. No words necessary…We assess everyone. I was married to an obvious ESTJ. What was I thinking?We aren’t great at communication. Add a brain injury to that, and we’re fucked.We’re also, generally, obsessed with the fact that we’ve found a forum where we can (from a huge distance) interact with aliens from the same planet, in the same dimension. We don’t have to put up with bullying, or cater our words to others’ sensibilities. We can say whatever the fuck we want, and know that there’s another INTJ (or INxx, whatever!), reading our “spillage”, picking up exactly what we’re putting down.90% of our obsession, though, is FINALLY UNDERSTANDING OURSELVES. That’s all we’ve ever wanted. What a moment of exhalation THAT is.I’m not “high functioning autism”, “awkward”, or “weird”. I’m a fucking unicorn!It’s glorious.

They’d stolen it from Xerox, but Xerox was clueless about how to market it, so Apple took it and ran with it. Xerox could stick to copiers, which they were already synonymous with.The problem is that Apple sat on its laurels with the classic Mac OS, failing to develop a next-generation version or do anything more than just add extensions to the original base that added instability to the system. To be fair, they did rewrite large parts of it with the move from System 6 to System 7, but System 7 was a steaming pile of crap anyway, and only succeeded because DOS and early versions of Windows were piles of crap that had been sitting out in the July sun for three days.Well, to make along story short, by the mid-1990s, Windows didn’t suck as bad as it once did. It had a UI that is still very popular today, and it had protected memory, and it had simultaneous multitasking, and it had a larger base of available software than the Mac did. It was just as unstable as Mac OS, but you could buy a Windows 95 computer for a fraction of the cost of a Mac.Apple needed a competitive response, and they couldn’t come up with one. They had a massive in-house project, Copland, designed to produce a modern Mac OS 8, but problems with feature creep and backwards compatibility with previous versions of Mac OS torpedoed it. An attempt to work with IBM on a new OS, Taligent, failed as well. By mid-1996, Apple was down to its last resort, which was to try to buy a new OS from someone who knew what the hell they were doing.They entered talks with Be, Inc., whose CEO Jean-Louis Gassee was a former Apple employee. Their BeOS was modern, but it was unfinished—at the time, it couldn’t even print. But that was something Apple could solve, especially with Be’s own engineers helping. The problem was that Gassee didn’t think Apple had any other possibilities, and he set a ridiculous price for an unfinished OS that included a high-ranking position for himself at Apple. Apple said no thanks.They went on to talk to Microsoft about possibly making an OS based on the Windows NT kernel, and they considered reviving Taligent, and at one point they considered using Sun’s Solaris, but one day, Apple executive Ellen Hancock was talking to Steve Jobs, who was still running NeXT, whose OS was arguably the most advanced of the era—but which was still a niche product. This explains its history a little better:During their conversation, Jobs pointed out to Hancock that the NeXT operating system was finished, highly advanced, and since it was based on Unix, highly portable to other platforms. In other words, it was precisely what Apple needed to get itself out of its OS quagmire and move to the head of the class.The story is available online if you want more details. Apple bought NeXT, got the OS it needed, and also got a much more mature Jobs back. While they adapted NeXT to Apple’s hardware, they “faked it” by adding the usable features from Copland development to Mac OS 8 and 9, which made those viable enough for the time being, and encouraged Apple’s existing designer Jony Ive to come up with a series of new and imaginative products like the multi-colored iMacs, to boost marketshare. Jobs took over as CEO and struck a deal with Microsoft to get some updated software (Office, Internet Explorer, etc.) that Apple needed to survive.So NeXTSTEP became Mac OS X, and the rest is history.",20 followers,Rukmini Menon,922,0,0,2021,https://www.quora.com/Which-MBTI-types-are-most-likely-to-invent-the-next-technological-innovation
