Google and bookmarks are becoming a dominant way to navigate the web.It's becoming uncommon to write a specific domain name in the browser bar.  If it's a site you go to frequently, you may do it once and then bookmark it.  If it's a site you go to rarely then you're even less likely to write a name in a browser.  You're more likely to search for a term or click on a link to get there.This does not mean that the DNS is going to go away anytime soon.  The Internet still uses the DNS to access those machines, so it's still critical and will continue to grow.  But people will use the domain names as identifiers less and less.The issues you raise about squatting, speculating, ambiguous names, and central management are all elements of a system that relies on unique names.  There must be one authoritative database of these names and no two entities can have the same name.  And policies around their distribution need to be managed by some central entity; govt, NGO, or other.  Those problems will exist in any successor system you may look for.However there is another trend occurring that is becoming a new way to identify people and businesses.  It's the social graph used by social networks.  For example in Facebook there are multiple people with my same name, i.e., our Facebook identifiers.  But people that are looking for me choose me over the others because they know other things about me, such as where I live, where I grew up, who my friends are, where I work.It's quite possible in the future that our social graph will allow us to use our actual name as our identifier on the web.",654 followers,Natalie Brownell,6.2K,0,0,2013,https://www.quora.com/What-technology-will-replace-domain-names
