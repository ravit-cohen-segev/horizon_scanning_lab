0,"The short, sweet answer is NO!!We could simulate some powers with prosthetics and machine assist, but never on the scale shown by Sci-Fi superheroes.The main problem comes with the frailty of human flesh and bones. If you enhance speed and strength beyond certain points, the bones break, and the flesh ruptures. This problem remains no matter how you achieve the powers. Thus, you are left with protecting the body with suits or prosthetics.","2,522 followers",Martin Vratny,1.7K,2.9K,9.8M,2020,https://www.quora.com/In-the-future-can-we-get-superpowers-like-science-fictions-with-our-advanced-technology

They've signed multiple Military and Information sharing pacts with each other as well and I'm sure many more are coming in near future.According to America's own diplomats “USA needs India more than India needs USA ”.But USA has it's own motives. China will surpass USA in almost everything by the end of this decade which will eventually end the Western Hegemony.India is the only country which can counter China in the current scenario.

Smaller cities have buses available that will take you just about everywhere within the city and bigger cities have subways as well as buses. For going between cities and provinces, China has a high speed rail system in place that is more extensive than the American highway system! For example: I lived in a city called Nanjing in China - about 200 miles/300 km from Shanghai. I could take a high speed train from Nanjing to Shanghai in about 1.5 hours!In contrast, I took an Amtrak train from Detroit to Chicago (about 300 miles/480 km) and it took over 8 hours!Another area China wins at is public utilities. They provide electricity, water, and gas for billions of people for very affordable prices! I paid maybe a total of $20 (US) per month for all utility bills, whereas it cost me over $100 in America! Atop of that is wireless technology (which is considered a public utility in China). I paid 100 rmb ($15) monthly for 16 GB of 4G data, with 1000 texts and 500 minutes of talk (which pretty much meant unlimited everything for me). In America I pay $50 a month for my unlimited plan. Yes, the 4G is a little faster, but that may just be because I’m not trying to access the foreign web here…A third area (kinda related to the second) is how the CCP controls markets and prices so everyone can live a comfortable life.

The thing is we have to take a look at the innards of a country to really know whether or not you are truly developed. That Chinese are so obsessed with portraying the facade that they are technologically advanced and ahead is actually an indication that they have not fully developed yet. Because fully developed countries have no need to show off things like that. Everyone knows they are developed.For example, here is San Francisco:Look, not many skyscrapers right? And look at those old cable cars going around! That must mean they are undeveloped right? Nope. Everyone knows San Francisco is a developed city. That’s why it has no need to show off with luxury skyscrapers and such things.Or how about Florence, Italy?Again, no skyscrapers here. But everyone knows it’s a developed city and Italy is a developed country.My point is, you have got to look at the people and the innards of a country to truly know if they are developed.This is the true face of China:You have got to look at the average person. Does the average Chinese have good access to healthcare (which is ranked near the bottom in WHO rankings btw)? Can they drink tap water safely? Do they have access to quality food? Do all have access to electricity or paved roads or a quality education? The answer is: probably, yes, if you are living in the rich east coast provinces of Jiangsu or Zhejiang or Guangdong- but not if you are living in say - Xinjiang or Gansu or Tibet. China’s wealth is not spread equally, neither is it developed equally. Even though the CCP has developed China quite fast - there is still a lot of work to be done making sure *every Chinese* have equal access to everything.And then you got to look at the attitude of the people. When I was in China I found that you really got to look out for who you trust, because there is a lot of scams going on all the time. You never know what is real, what is fake, what is real price of anything. Why do these scams exist? Because people have to be desperate to make money that’s why.Why are people desperate to make money? Probably because they are not making enough to survive, which is an indication that the country is still developing. You’ll notice that in general, the more developed a country is, the less likely there will be scams. In Korea/Japan/Taiwan, you will not find very many scams. In China and Eastern Europe it’s likely.Another aside I want to note is that Chinese bathrooms don’t contain any toilet paper. Do you know the reason why? It’s because people steal it. Now, in what developed country does this happen? I can’t think of any. Only in a developing country would you need to bring your own toilet paper to the bathroom because there isn’t any there due to fear of people stealing it.I find GDP/capita to be generally a pretty good indicator of how developed a country is. The average GDP/capita (PPP) of China is still around $8k/person. While that is higher than most Asian countries - it’s still below the 4 East Asian tigers + Japan and far from the $62k/person that the USA has.The true measure of a developed society is to observe the people that live in the country and not the appearance of the country itself. Chinese “face” culture is the same. You can just obviously see that China has developed really really fast, and mentality wise people are still harping about luxury products and consumerism - this is where Americans were back in the 50s, 60s and 70s, not now.The biggest consumers of luxury products are Chinese people, not Americans or Europeans. The more developed you are, the less need you have to validate your self worth with materialism. The less desire you have to spend thousands of dollars on your children's schooling just to send them to be educated abroad. The less need to travel to countries like Canada or USA for giving birth so that your child becomes a US or Canadian citizen, or to launder your money by buying up real estate in other countries. Developed countries do not need to do things like that.Thats why you should always pay attention to the old adage -Edit:Of course, Chinese commenters love to bring up the USA. Yes, USA has lots of impoverished areas too; every country has developed areas and undeveloped areas, however my point is that for China there is significantly more undeveloped areas at a higher % compared to the USA. The poverty rate for China is 16% as of 2019 and for USA it is 1.5% as of 2019.

Chinese are also leading in the amount of intellectual property patents for design and industrial engineering and again going ahead of US. More than 60% of the papers written in steel industry belong to Chinese research engineers.They have huge technological companies which can go one on one with their equivalent Us ones . For example like Alibaba (Amazon), Baidu (Google), Xiaomi (Apple), Tucent(Facebook), Did Chuxing (Uber),Youku(youtube and Netflix), QQ(Spotify) etc. The list goes on. These companies are financially as strong or sometimes stronger than their American counterparts. Having access to such a large population helps. That the government helps by restricting competition from outside definitely helps a lot.This domination does not end just in technological sector. Siemens and Alsthom had to merge in September this year (2017) to counter CRRC in the high speed rail building industry. This merger will bring a 18billion$ competitor to CRRC which is having an annual revenue of 35billion$. They are very active in infrastructure projects in Africa where the western world is not so involved.The government is stable and enforcing technological advancement with authority (of course it is difficult to enforce such things so hard in democratic countries). Intelligent Steel making , Indistry 4.0 , Driverless Electric buses (running in Taiyuan), Electric Taxis all are examples of Government backed advances. Sometimes experiments fail like the straddling bus in Qinhuangdao. But then such steps help technological advancement.So I would not say that Chinese are the most technologically advanced country yet. But considering the above arguments, in decades for sure it will be.","5,990 followers",Jens Böttiger,566,2.6K,17.6M,2018,https://www.quora.com/In-the-future-can-we-get-superpowers-like-science-fictions-with-our-advanced-technology

With the enemy not having the ability to shoot back, guess who can concentrate SOLELY on firing and not getting shot at in return.What about this guy?Falcon is shooting Steyr SPPs, they’re shooting 9mm pistol rounds and they were pretty darn effective, not to mention that him flying means he wasn’t able to really get hit til he flew too low. You know what would be even better than one of him in the air?How about a few of these bad boys which has a standard load of up to 8 hellfire missiles and 38 70mm rockets with 1,200 rounds of 30mm ammo that would absolutely shred anything a 9mm could touch. Also since they hover, they can safely sit above their own forces and rain down hell WITHOUT flying over the enemy and risking them jumping up and getting them.Remember this guy as well?Rhodes in this image is about to drop a bunch of small cluster bombs on the enemy line, a tactic that is shown to be VERY effective in this type of close contact fight. Since he’s also in the sky the enemy is pretty much unable to attack him, since they don’t have range. Now I’m not going to say that he isn’t better armed than most weapons platforms, because I think he is, but you know what comes close?Designed to kill tanks, this thing has a 30mm gatling gun, designed for low speeds, and can drop bombs in close air support. Throw 5 of those in the air and you have some pretty nice air coverage over a small enemy line.Ok but the spears are close combat weapons, that gives them an advantage in close combat. Yea modern militaries have those they’re these things.Meet the modern day bayonet. Fun fact spears/pikes were discontinued from militaries because as soon as the bayonet was developed every rifleman became a spear man. That also meant that every range troop became a melee troop.Now Wakanda did have some cool things that would have made them more effective than modern military such as this.But you know what makes that no longer worthwhile? When you order your troops to do this.The shield wall shown above looks pretty Roman inspired (makes sense Romans did invade parts of Africa), it’s designed for you to attack the person to your right and the guy to the left to attack the man in front of you. Leading towards enemies being attacked by someone they aren’t facing. You also know why it works so well? Because the formation and everyone acting as one unit can stop a charging force dead in their tracks and essentially it’s just enemies beating against a wall. You know what makes it worthless and how Romans lost battles, when they lose the shield wall and did what you see above.The wall is so effective guess who still uses it today!Modern SWAT teams for riot control!This also doesn’t take into account modern armies using things like theseOr theseOr how about theseNow I’m not saying that battle wasn’t entertaining, because it definitely was. But what I am saying is that rushing into a group of monsters with spears that shoot FREAKING ENERGY instead of standing back behind your shield wall and shooting them til they actually get close enough to engage in melee is so dumb that Black Panther should have his crown taken away, all of his generals should lose their positions, and USAF Colonel Rhodes, and USAF Pararescue Trooper Sam Wilson, and Captain Steve Rodgers who fought in World War 2 with ground combat experience should be ashamed and feel responsible for a LOT of Wakandan deaths.The Wakanda Sonic Spear is a great idea, and is a call back to weapons that Africa is most recognized for, shields and spears. For cinematic purposes it also looks neat, but practically it’s not that great considering that aiming a spear from 100 yards away is going to be a HELL of a lot harder than aiming a rifle with a scope. It was also shown that the power wasn’t necessary against their opponents, so that didn’t really make it worthwhile either.End of the day it’s a movie and it does look cool. Reality is that an energy spear isn’t practical at all and that even if they took them throughout the world a modern army would mop the floor with them with what we’ve seen them use. We’ve seen no artillery, air support, or armored units really and quite frankly a modern military could kill their troops without Wakanda even seeing them before the bombs or artillery started dropping. This doesn’t mention at all that seeing a freaking energy blast travel through the air gives away your position pretty easily!So there’s the answer, they look cool but in reality they’re dumb. You don’t need an energy spear to kill someone when a bullet will do the job just as well.*****EDIT 1: Thank you to to everyone, this is my largest Quora answer to date and hats off to the great and respectful comments all around thank you guys.Special shoutout to Jonathan Lausch for his edit suggestions as well.EDIT 2: 1.8k upvotes wow thank you everyone!

This is the time to make the hard decisions.I see plenty of places here that can be easily defended by a comparatively small force2. As a consequence to mistake #1, they had to open their force field, which now became largely useless. If they had instead chosen to defend a building or underground complex, then the force field could have bought them more time.3. They used 18th century line formations. Even for Napoléon, this only worked in conjunction with his artillery (which Wakanda lacked completely), and it quickly got out of fashion a few decades later when better guns were invented.4. They gave up their formation and higher ground in order to charge the enemy. God (Thanos) knows why.5. Despite their advanced technology and access to vibranium, their shields were mostly useless due to the aforementioned charge, and they lacked grenades, mines, vibranium armor for their soldiers, an air force, drones, artillery, mortars, any kind of smoke or deception tactics, any kind of heavy-projectile weapons, snipers, suppressive fire, flamethrowers, blockades, traps, … I could go on and on. Even a Roman centurion could have built better defences than them.6. The force field was useless against the large spinning wheels, which could just dig through the ground. So, that basically makes the force field useless against anyone who can bring a digger. Why couldn’t it continue into the ground? Even a metal wall would have helped some.7. When Thor appeared, the clear course of action would have been to close the force field again, and focus all forces (and Avengers) on protecting and/or exfiltrating Vision. Thor could’ve just used his lightning on any outriders that would dare come close to the force field. Instead, everyone just forgot about Vision, and they wasted time killing off stragglers.8. The defences put in place to protect Vision were laughable. A handful of bodyguards and that’s it. No force fields, traps, panic room, hidden layers, fast escapes, nothing. Sure, initially that was Scarlet Witch’s role, but she already showed that she couldn’t handle two members of the Black Order.9. They failed to utilize Scarlet Witch from the start. Clearly, she has a power level way, way above everyone else, and would have been more useful at the frontline.10. They failed in using any kind of effective communications whatsoever, so that the bodyguards of Shuri and Shuri herself could warn everyone that Vision was in danger. Seriously, a simple motion detector and an alarm would’ve sufficed here. Instead, most defenders were left in the dark, and it took Captain America shouting (after literally watching Vision fly out of the window) for them to find out that their primary asset was in danger.I loved this movie, but one shouldn’t take the Battle for Wakanda too seriously.",181 followers,Kenny Nguyen,1.3K,2.3K,45.8M,2018,https://www.quora.com/In-the-future-can-we-get-superpowers-like-science-fictions-with-our-advanced-technology

You have a lot of the same neurons now as you did 10 years ago. one of the things that happens when you get smarter is simply the appearance of more connectiion between the existing neurons. There is not the same process of continuous replacement. Over time, because atoms, molecules, the building blocks of the cells eventually degrade, the neurons start fucking up. They don’t work as well. In response you have two options:The problem with the first option is that it’s obviously impossible. You can’t do it.The problem with the second one is more subtle.Replacing your dying neurons with new ones will not result in the continuation of your consciousness. It might seem that way from the outside, if the new neurons are able to assimilate the information from their predecessors accurately, but in fact what is happening is the same as what you see whenever people mention “uploading their minds on a computer”. It’s just copying. You can’t upload a mind from a brain into a computer. When you send an e-mail, you’re sending a copy of an e-mail. You’re not moving a thing. You can’t move a mind. You can’t move information. Likewise, you can’t move your consciousness from one set of neurons to another, even inside the same head, even if it takes a long ass time. It will look like you are continuing to live indefinitely, but in fact you will simply fade away and leave your body to a copy of you. And that copy will do the same the next time the neurons are replaced. And so on and so on.If you can’t make sense of that, it’s entirely understandable; I am no expert.So here’s a more Roddenberry-esque response: people won’t care that much about dying in the future.
