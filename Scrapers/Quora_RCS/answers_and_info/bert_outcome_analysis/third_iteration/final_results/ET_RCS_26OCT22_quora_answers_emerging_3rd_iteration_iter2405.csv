I’d be more than willing to discuss it if anybody is interested.Paper bills are highly outdated, but given that not everyone shall be able to switch immediately, it shall certainly be a gradual change,but it shall happen nevertheless.Reference:7 Surprising Biometric Identification MethodsWhat will be the impact of demonetization in India and how could it have been minimized?","5,990 followers",Jens Böttiger,566,2.6K,17.6M,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-kind-of-advanced-technologies-would-replace-paper-bills-banknotes

Many people just use currency for convenience purchases, but make the bulk of their purchases using credit cards, debit cards, Apple pay, and other forms of electronic payment. So existing technology has already began to replace currency, and the portion of the US money supply kept as currency has been declining for a good 20 years owing to advancing technology. So especially in a city like New York, San Francisco, or Boston, an average person could probably go through the week without using currency at all.

Germany is not the most technologically advanced country. It could be pretty close, but there are major elements of society who dedicate themselves to making sure that Germany uses inferior technology that kills more people, damages the environment more, costs more money, and will cause the total collapse of Earth’s biosphere due to a runaway greenhouse effect. Mostly in the Green Party. Because radiation from nuclear accidents is apparently scarier than way more people dying of regular pollution constantly and the total annihilation of all life on Earth as the oceans boil away.","5,990 followers",Jens Böttiger,566,2.6K,17.6M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-kind-of-advanced-technologies-would-replace-paper-bills-banknotes

They split them into two groups, with the difference being instructions given.The first group was given a vague “Dear Student” request asking them to donate food and telling them where they could drop it off and when.The second group was given much more specific direction. They were addressed by name in the letter, given direction on specific foods to bring (i.e. Creamed Corn), a map directing them to the drop box, a specific time to visit and then a follow-up call reminding them of what they learned in the letter.Even one in four jerks showed up with some creamed cornMake It Easy To Help YouWhen I suggest to a job seeker that they need to approach as many decision makers as possible, I often hear “I’ve tried that, it doesn’t work.”Perhaps, you have tried. How many did you reach out to? Five? Ten? How about 500? How bad to do you want a better job?Your alternative is starting your own business and I assure you that you will reach out to far more strangers than 500 to accomplish that.How easy are you making it on those you reach out to? Are you leaving them with open-ended requests to help you?How many decisions do they have to make when they open your email?They now have one decision to make. They can forward the email to someone in their network, who is most likely junior to their position if you did the homework. Or, they can delete your email.It is still likely they will not help you, just like 75% of the jerks in the study still didn’t donate to the food drive. That said, you give yourself a much better chance of sparking an action on your behalf if you are clear, direct and ask for something that requires a quick decision or action.Do the work for the person you need help from.

14,"All species have a range and when that range is filled, those who live there must compete with one another over limited resources.Humans evolved from lowland apes in Africa. When we filled that range some humans created new technologies of clothing, fire and shelter to extend their range. This expanded range is called the frontier.

New resources are found in the frontier enriching all. In this environment cooperation is favoured over competition, since cooperation brings more resources from the frontier into the center enriching us all.In the present age our frontier is interplanetary space, and beyond that, interstellar space. Interplanetary space is traverse by chemical rockets. The first large chemical rockets were developed in the 1940s and advanced continuously since. Investment in rocket technology reduces the cost of momentum delivered by rockets. This increases the mass flow per dollar between points where the change in speed is fixed to connect the two places. Thus development follows a well defined arc;At this point serious investment in lowering the cost of momentum delivered by rockets was abandoned. Project funding for atomic rockets was ended, and previously declassified materials were reclassified. Had funding and focus continued apace we would have hadThe founding of Space in 2002 resulted in a rocket with a reusable first stage. This dramatically cut the cost of space launch and allowed SpaceX to come to dominate space launch and earn significant profits doing so.It takes 52 days 16 hours to fly to Pluto at 1/10th gee using photonic thrusters.To perform interstellar trips requires vastly more energy. Yet, that energy is available from the Sun. The way we tap the sun’s energy at the scale needed is by creating an optical machine made of plasma. You see, the refractive index of hot plasmas changes with temperature. So, by projecting a pattern of laser light into the chromosphere to create an optical element that is capable of communicating, computing, generating controlled laser beams, and making copies of itself. So, taking an hour to replicate, projecting a single square meter of plasmonic structure into the sun it takes only 62.4 hours to cover the entire sun with an array of such machines, and capture 18% of the sun’s luminosity for human use. The entire sun may be considered a single optical element and thus can project similar patterns to nearby stars. Those stars signal back their status, and repeat the process, expanding outward. In this ways the interplanetary cyclers are upgraded to interstellar cycler operating at 1 gee. The sun boosts the photonic thruster at 1 gee to the half way point and light originating from the destination star slows the ship’s speed beyond that point. In this way humanity will be able to travel freely across the galaxy.All products and services diffuse into use in a well defined way.It is no different for interplanetary settlement or interstellar settlement. The interesting aspect it that population grows at 1.06% and even with unlimited life span, population wil grow at less than 2%. Innovators constitute 2.5% of the population, whilst Early adopters constitute 13.5%. So as soon as cost effective interplanetary travel and interstellar travel is available everyone will make use of it within 20 to 40 years, and the Earth will be depopulated, and later, the Solar System will be depopulated.Time Dilation and the Ultimate FrontierNow, after travelling 2.15 light years at 1 gee acceleration — half way to the nearest star — a ship attains 95.15% light speed slowing time aboard ship (and reproductive rate) by 3.25x. This distance is half way to the nearest star. Longer distances produce even higher speeds and higher dilations. Creating extreme dilations in time. This means that populations that are moving across the galaxy do not reproduce until they get to where they are going. Yet, the loss rate of ships scales with distance. At some point the loss at a given range equals the total births within the volume of the sphere with that range. Beyond that range, the number of humans fall off. Humans becoming increasingly rare beyond this range. Even if starships are safer than sitting in your living room, this will occur because of time dilation.This is the final condition of a technical species. Occupying a sphere of over a billion stars that is 10,000 light years across, commanding vast material and energy resources, living a cooperative life style in a post scarcity civilisation.","112,825 followers",Samantha Kannan,6.9K,3.2K,151.9M,1999,https://www.quora.com/What-if-humans-stop-advancing-technology-right-now-Nothing-new-is-created-not-even-variations-of-what-we-have-right-now

20,"In real life, lots of things were “invented” long before they could be practically built. The long evolution of firearms is the perfect example. People could imagine better guns, but they couldn’t actually build them, because the metallurgy and materials science and manufacturing science wasn’t advanced enough. So everyone could see the advantages of breechloading rifles over muzzleloading muskets. But building one that wouldn’t explode in your hands was another matter entirely.

So everyone could see the advantages of breechloading rifles over muzzleloading muskets. But building one that wouldn’t explode in your hands was another matter entirely. Making effective breechloaders didn’t require someone to have a flash of insight, it required lots of plain plodding evolutionary steps in manufacturing high strength metal parts to extremely fine tolerances.In real life the idea for an invention is the easy part. Making a prototype that actually kind-of, sort-of works is another. Making something that will work reliably is another. Making something that can be mass produced is another. Making something that can be mass produced and sold at a profit is another. Making mass producing and selling your product into a profitable business is yet another.So the idea of “take some dragonpowder, stuff it into a tube with a handle, stuff a lump of plumbum in, and set off the dragonpowder with a length of burning rope” is all well and good. Getting a weapon that will hit the broad side of a barn, with enough force to at least dent the boards, without explodinating in your face, is quite another. And in real life it took hundreds of years of design improvements and battlefield testing before gunpowder weapons changed from a curiosity to proven war-winning technology.In any case, early gunpowder weapons aren’t, in my opinion, a game-breaking technology, since in reality they were present in the late medieval battlefield, but weren’t all that useful. Longbowmen and crossbowmen were still much better than arquebusiers.Early gunpowder weapons would mix in just fine with knights in shining armor and wood elf bowmen and magic missile slinging wizards. So if you’ve got a dwarf who wants a hand cannon, then feel free to let him have one. The only problem is if you make those early gunpowder weapons work as effectively as modern firearms. They were heavy, loud, had one shot, took a very long time to reload, and were inaccurate as hell.",0 followers,David Bushey,1.8K,3K,5.7M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-kind-of-advanced-technologies-would-replace-paper-bills-banknotes
21,"Budget for one. Inventing stuff is expensive, even more expensive than you may think and even without prooftesting and optimisation. If someone makes something in their garage it’s an already invented thing for which they can get the parts that they need to combine into one, because you’re not inventing something completely new like a time machine with anything short of university-level funding and time.Difficulty. Do not underestimate how difficult it is to go from scrap to something. For the consumer it may sound easy because factories are using machines and kids to make phones, but the inveBudget for one.

Do not underestimate how difficult it is to go from scrap to something. For the consumer it may sound easy because factories are using machines and kids to make phones, but the invention process is no laughing matter or just ‘I want more, so I added more’. I myself just finished a 7.5 month internship trying to improve the sound volume of screenprinted piezoelectric loudspeakers, and even with full 40h/week work hours and most equipment readily available you’d be surprised how little you fit in those 7.5 months because everything takes longer than you’d expect. Also, how much extra time you lose on documentation, calculations and showing your progress to people and in reports. I’d once heard from someone in the Hollywood CGI business that professionals make an estimate of how long they need to animate some scene, and that the producers then double or tripple that time as the soft deadline of when to expect it.Availability. What you want to do, has to be available. You never quite find the right materials or properties that you need during initial production. You’d think that getting polyethylene glycol substrates that are a bit thinner than what I had would be easy, but no. Not to mention finding chemicals with the right properties that don’t also come with several production or side-effect problems. During inventing you don’t have the perfectly-fitting-together and optimal size and properties stuff that the factories use, you have to use materials that you wouldn’t use for the final product just to get things optimal enough for them to work at all (like using platina electrodes instead of the lesser electrodes you’d use later, which are too expensive for the final product).Getting the idea at all. A lot of inventions seem obvious or simple now that we have them, doesn’t mean that they were that obvious and easy when they didn’t exist yet.","16,336 followers",Jae Alexis Lee,923,4.6K,42.8M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-kind-of-advanced-technologies-would-replace-paper-bills-banknotes
