1,"The idea of “progress” just for the sake of progress seems to be primarily a EuroChristian concept.

Diamond argues that the gaps in power and technology between human societies originate primarily in environmental differences, which are amplified by various positive feedback loops. When cultural or genetic differences have favored Eurasians (for example, written language or the development among Eurasians of resistance to endemic diseases), he asserts that these advantages occurred because of the influence of geography on societies and cultures (for example, by facilitating commerce and trade between different cultures) and were not inherent in the Eurasian genomes.The crux of the explanation is geography.The geography of Europe strongly encouraged development of boatbuilding & ship building, it had lots of useful deposits of minerals not far from good natural ports. This encouraged trade & shipbuilding and navigation skills. The mountainous terrain of Europe combined with good ports & rivers made small city-states practical which encourages smaller nations that competed in technology more.",8 followers,Dima Ma,3.7K,2.1K,3.5M,2019,https://www.quora.com/How-come-Europeans-developed-advanced-technology-while-native-americans-didnt

As such, they are early adopters of these technologies, before the commercial world gets access to them. Inevitably, all military secrets don’t stay secret for ever, and you can buy items that were invented specifically for military purposes.The speed at which some military product inventions reach the commercial market is astounding. And in some cases, military inventions show up in commercial product before it’s military use is realized. This is because of the different in development cycle times between military/commercial.Sole BeneficiaryThere is also a case when new technology is so valuable and decisive, that the military simply buys everything the manufacturer can produce. This happened for early Toshiba laptops and computer memory modules. Right now Microsoft’s Hololens is being snatched up solely by the military, for some tank visibility system (similar to what the F-35 helmet does). These are just a few I can recall, I’m sure there are many more.And some technologies seem to disappear from public availability. It appears that the military gets involved and suddenly there is shroud of silence. This is speculation, because there are other possibilities and I’m not privy to US military secrets. So, I’m not 100% certain, but there are cases of new, promising discoveries that suddenly go dark. The ultra-capacitor from EEStor was one of these cases. It announced new technology of amazing energy density and weight and then POOF…total silence. Afterward, it appears that Lockheed Martin and EEStor worked together on some energy storage product for the military.Now, this might just be case of false company hype (indeed, the technology itself seemed too good to be true). But, this scenario seems to play out the same for other technologies that have a substantial military benefit.In these cases (if true), I’d suspect the military would come in and say, “I’ll buy everything you can make, for X dollars, for the next 10 years, and all you have to do is keep it secret”.Maybe just a conspiracy theory of mine.

Other forms consist of a helix revolving in a fixed cylinder or a helical tube wound around a shaft.The Archimedes Screw is still used today in some limited applications (usually electrically-powered), and can range in size from a quarter of an inch to nearly 4 meters (12 feet) in diameter. A large screw or banks of screws may be used to pump rainstorm runoff or to lift water or wastewater, for example.2.THE BATTERY-The Baghdad Battery, sometimes referred to as the Parthian Battery, is a clay pot which encapsulates a copper cylinder. Suspended in the centre of this cylinder but not touching it is an iron rod. Both the copper cylinder and the iron rod are held in place with an asphalt plug. These artifacts (more than one was found) were discovered during the 1936 excavations of the old village Khujut Rabu, near Baghdad. The village is considered to be about 2000 years old, and was built during the Parthian period (250BC to 224 AD). Although it is not known exactly what the use of such a device would have been, the name ‘Baghdad Battery’, comes from one of the prevailing theories established in 1938 when Wilhelm Konig, the German archaeologist who performed the excavations, examined the battery and concluded that this device was an ancient electric battery. After the Second World War, Willard Gray, an American working at the General Electric High Voltage Laboratory in Pittsfield, built replicas and, filling them with an electrolyte, found that the devices could produce 2 volts of electricity. The question remains, if it really was a battery, what was it used to power?3. THE CALENDAR-Research carried out last year on an ancient site excavated by the National Trust for Scotland in 2004 revealed that it contained a sophisticated calendar system that is approximately 10,000 years old, making it the oldest calendar ever discovered in the world. The site at Warren Field, Crathes, Aberdeenshire – contains a 50 metre long row of twelve pits which were created by Stone Age Britons and which were in use from around 8000 BC (the early Mesolithic period) to around 4,000 BC (the early Neolithic). The pits represent the months of the year as well as the lunar phases of the moon. They were formed in a complex arc design in which each lunar month was divided into three roughly ten day weeks representing the waxing moon, the full moon and the waning moon. It also allowed the observation of the mid-winter sunrise so that the lunar calendar could be recalibrated each year to bring it back in line with the solar year. The entire arc represents a whole year and may also reflect the movements of the moon across the sky.4.STEAM ENGINE-Heron Alexandrinus, otherwise known as the Hero of Alexandria, was a 1st century Greek mathematician and engineer who is known as the first inventor of the steam engine. His steam powered device was called the aeolipile, named after Aiolos, God of the winds. The aeolipile consisted of a sphere positioned in such a way that it could rotate around its axis. Nozzles opposite each other would expel steam and both of the nozzles would generate a combined thrust resulting in torque, causing the sphere to spin around its axis. The rotation force sped up the sphere up to the point where the resistance from traction and air brought it to a stable rotation speed. The steam was created by boiling water under the sphere – the boiler was connected to the rotating sphere through a pair of pipes that at the same time served as pivots for the sphere.Some old steam engines are still used in certain areas of the world and in antique locomotives. However, steam power is still heavily used around the world in various applications. Many modern electrical plants use steam generated by burning coal to produce electricity.5.Earthquake Detector 132 A D -Earthquake Detector 132 A D According to court records of the later Han Dynasty, a seismograph was created by the brilliant inventor Zhang Heng (78-140 AD) in 132 AD. Its function is to determine the direction of an earthquake. In 138 AD, this instrument indicated an earthquake occurring in Longxi a thousand kilometers away. It was the first time that mankind to detect an earthquake. Modern seismographs only began development in 1848 in Europe.6.Paper Money 9th century A.D.-Paper money were first developed by the ancient Chinese, who started using folding money at the end of the 8th or beginning of the 9th century AD. Paper bills were originally used as privately issued bills of credit or exchange notes. A merchant could deposit his cash in the capital, receiving a paper “exchange certificate” which he could exchange for metal coins in other cities.Thanks for scrolling,Sandip bhatnagar.",102 followers,Vishal Detroja,11.1K,0,0,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-advanced-technologies-are-only-used-by-military-organizations-and-not-by-anyone-else

At the time of its loss in the shipwreck, the device was pretty old, believed to have been in use for at least 60 years.

At the time of its loss in the shipwreck, the device was pretty old, believed to have been in use for at least 60 years. The device, made of brass, has a number of moving parts and dials like a clock that when operated would describe the motion of the planets and the moon on certain dates. It was made in Greece and uses a level of multiple technologies thought not possible at the time including precision metallurgy, screws, toothed gears, gradation of dials, precision metal construction and so on. It wouldn’t be until about 1453 that any comparable technology would be re-invented in the use of mechanical clocks and most of these were made out of carved wood because the precision metallurgy and construction needed to make them was rare or non-existent (John Harrison’s church clocks made in the 1700s were made entirely of wood including the self-lubricating lignum-vitae and still tell accurate time today).ElectroplatingWhile modern electroplating goes back to 1805 based on the 1799 invention of the voltaic pile, or “battery” as we call it today, it has been shown that it is possible that ancient Persians (today, Iranians) were using electroplating as early as 224 BC. The device has been shown in modern times on numerous occasions to be capable of electroplating objects if grape juice and a ground-up beetle were used to create a weak electric current. Although experiments have shown this to be possible, there are many missing elements that would have been needed including drawn copper or gold wire, insulators and connectors. So there is still some doubt about it as an electroplating machine. In addition, there are no known electroplated objects extant from that period so there is no product that demonstrates the machine was used or even possible. This information suggests the knowledge and use of electricity which wasn’t commonly known to exist until Ben Franklin proved it in 1752 showing that lightning was actually electricity. From there, a torrent of discoveries were made by Volta, Faraday and others.Stone ToolsStone tools were among the first man-made manufactured objects but it requires a loosely defined definition of “man”. Some of these tools go back to about 1.7 million years and some even further. One of the oldest is the Tanzanian Oldowan tool “industry” (in this use, the word “industry” has a different meaning than we use it on a regular basis). In addition, this was followed by the more complex Acheulean tool industry in France about the same time period. The ancients used stone tools for cutting, pounding and scraping and sought out particular types of stone for the way they broke at certain fracture points, one of the most desirable being obsidian, one of the most common being flint. Today, the sharpest blades in the world are still made of obsidian which can be sharpened to single molecule thickness on the edge.Of course everyone talks of Hero’s Aeliopile or early steam engines. These machines were for demonstration and never did any kind of useful work.There is an opposite and associated question, which technologies are NEWER than they appear and this is equally fascinating.People take for granted certain things such as the “chimney”. While the chimney seems pretty simple to us, the first use of residential chimneys wasn’t until a king in England put one in his castle in 1185 with a smoke hood to evacuate the smoke from his Great Room. Until then, large campfires were made right on the stone (or dirt) floor and the smoke escaped from the windows. It was a horrible price to pay for heat. Even then, residential chimneys in houses were not common until the 1600s. The Pilgrims coming to America had no chimneys in their homes - just a hole in the roof to allow smoke to escape. Certain laws were passed requiring “mud daubing” in homes to prevent sparks from setting the wood on fire. When the first chimney was invented, in the castle in Yorkshire it was the wonder of the age and people and scientists came from all over to investigate the modern invention and its obvious improvement over the current method of allowing the house to fill with smoke just to get heat. Note that building a chimney that drafts properly is not just a matter of stacking stone in a cylinder but requires other elements to make it work efficiently.Another more “modern” invention we take for granted today is the fireplace fire grate. This simple device was invented in 1678 in Germany by Prince Rupert and was a major step forward in heating. All at once, it lifted the fire off the floor and allowed enveloping ventilation that produced more fire, more heat, less smoke and more light. By the 1700s, this was still considered “advanced technology” but homes everywhere implemented all manner of fire grates and cranes and cooking implements to take advantage of the fire grate.Another technology that is much newer than most people think is the “fork”. While it was invented in Turkey in about 450 AD it was rarely used, thought to be an affectation of homosexuals and was banned by the church for awhile as blasphemy, since god gave us “fingers”. It was not until the world’s first tourist, an Englishman by the name Thomas Coryat who traveled Europe and wrote a “blog” of his adventures. He brought the fork to England in 1611 and after awhile it became the plaything of the elite, and each guest brought his own fork in a special box. In those days, forks had only two tines. The four-tine fork we know today did not come into common usage until the mid-1800s.",0 followers,Kalie Marie,1K,65,1.3M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-advanced-technologies-are-only-used-by-military-organizations-and-not-by-anyone-else
23,"The problem with pointing at obsolescence is that things have a very long tail.

And yet, film photography has had a small bit of a resurgence in the last ten years. So yeah, it’s fairly obsolete, but it still exists.I’d claim that gas powered chainsaws, lawnmowers, weed whackers, etc. are at least on the way out for regular consumers. I actually owned a tree farm for 18 years and did a 10–20 tree harvest every year. And of course, every year I had to get out the chainsaw, clean it, turn it up, maybe get it working, etc. Then I switched to an 80V battery powered chainsaw, and never did much more than ensure the chain oil was filled up. Just as powerful as my old Poulan. Now I have a battery powered weed wacker/edger and lawn mower. Sure, if you’re in the deep woods working professionally with a chainsaw, the energy density of gasoline is a big win, but otherwise, it makes no sense.The gasoline-powered car may also be on the way out. Now, of course, actual obsolescence is a different thing. Unless specifically outlawed — which may be happening in some countries — a gas-powered car isn’t truly obsolete as long as you can buy gasoline for it. But for the average person, that electric car that charges overnight in the garage means never needing to stop for a fillup. As battery technology progresses and gets cheaper, if you do need a charge on the road, the charging time will fall below a threshold and pretty much eliminate the last objection to the EV.And of course, EVs may be problematic for apartment/townhouse/condo dwellers. But even these are being addressed, with available EV charging. And, particularly for urban living, the whole idea of the personal car may be on the way out.The combination of on-demand car service and self-driving cars should make folks question their need to own a car. Every ride-share company and every car manufacturer is working on self-driving cars. Think of it this way: how much of your actual car do you use? Between my wife and I, we own three cars, so 100% of the time, one car (well, probably the pickup truck) isn’t being used. If I could call for a pickup to come for me when I needed it, or even paid the delivery charges for supplies (which I actually did this week for a $1,200 order of insulation and shiplap paneling), it would take me a pretty long time to get over the cost of the truck. Heck, even the insurance charge could pay rental for most of my use of the truck in a regular year. And I’d bet, across all three cars, we don’t even get 5% use on an annual basis. For very long-distance driving, it’s sometimes more economically sound to rent a vehicle than to use your own, anyway. Sure, we’re not crazy people, we buy used, but that’s about $40,000 worth of vehicle in the driveway getting $1,950 a year value, maybe… not counting the upkeep, insurance, fuel costs, etc.I know some millennials who, unlike the boomers and gen-xers back in their/our day, weren’t in any hurry to get a car or a driver’s license. After all, you can just call an Uber, eh? When that Uber arrives without a driver — which will mean, at that point, it’s already about 10x safer than a human driver, because that’s what everyone’s going to demand of self-driving cars — you’re also going to be paying less for the ride.At least for many kinds of work, the traditional office has been going away for quite some time. Though the pandemic rather forced this on society. Some people are going back, others, not so fast. My company put out a major new flagship product in 2020. I was getting more work done, but even more on my terms, and I was overall happier with work. I could work from the shore! It’s amazing what you can do with 500-something extra hours a year NOT commuting at all.For years, the traditional PC has been going away. For awhile, it was the laptop replacing the desktop, but recently, it’s been fully mobile devices replacing both. Now, I’m typing this on a desktop PC, one I put together myself, with a nice 34″ monitor, tons of RAM and storage, etc. But I’m a working professional. The average person has pretty much already moved to mobile devices, probably their phone, as the center of their computing experience. And why not?The PC was the second big revolution in computing. The first one was easy: computers exist, big organizations own them, and you can maybe get to use one if your work or education allows. The PC allowed you to own that computing yourself. But stil, the PC for most people is a place you go… I’m sitting in my office (okay, it’s at the shore house, but it’s still a place I go to use a computer) at the moment.The smartphone was the third big revolution in computing: the thing you always have with you. That’s why it’s your camera, your personal computer, your game machine, your notebook, your TV, and heck, you might even make a call on it once in awhile. Apple sells nearly as many iOS devices in a year as Microsoft sells Windows… and Android’s about 5x as many. The PC’s not exactly obsolete for everyone, but others have already gone over that hill.The other thing that’s starting to sink the big PC is cloud computing. Basically, if I can rent the high performance computing I need, why own it? The problem is more of a business one than a home use case, but it’s in both places. A business can buy a PC, but as things grow, they need more PCs every year, and eventually it’s ultimately cheaper to replace older, slower systems with newer, more power efficient PCs. Which is exactly what cloud computing does, transparent to you. You simply allocate the virtual PC you need based on the job at hand, vanish it if you no longer need it, etc.That said, cloud computing itself, or at least part of that, is likely to be replaced by edge computing… so hey, now we’re back on the PC again? Well, not exactly. Edge computing involves moving some critical elements of a cloud network to the edge of that network, where things needs to happen in real-time. For example, that self-driving car is probably in constant contact with a cloud computing resource, but that cloud can’t process data without the latency of the network. So the intelligence needed for the self-driving car moves to the car — the edge of the network that lives in the car itself, and works in concert with other things. A big deal in the future of self-driving vehicles is that network, make no mistake. When you have a road full of intelligence vehicles, they’re all talking to one another. So your car knows the car in front of your is about to stop before it actually starts to stop! Cars will make minute adjustments in speed to ensure intersections work without the need for lights or stop signs.The Digital SLR is on the way out. They’re still made by Canon, Nikon, and Pentax, but only Pentax isn’t spending more effort on mirrorless cameras. Sony had their A-Mount system, not exactly a DSLR by a similar idea, and that one’s already discontinued. Of course, for the average consumer, DSLRs, mirrorless, and point and shoot cameras have largely been replaced by the smartphone. Professionals and enthusiasts will continue to interchangeable-lens cameras, just as they did back in the 1970s and 1980s, but they’re increasingly a speciality item. Which, yes, is exactly how they began.In this era, it’s actually more difficult for a phone-shooter to move to a serious camera than it was back in the days of Instamatics and P&S film cameras. When you were growing up in the 70s and shooting on film, moving to a better film camera got you an instant jump in image quality. Yes, you might need to learn more about that new camera to keep improving, but you did, you got the better result, and before you knew it, you were riding your 10-speed bike all over town, shooting photos for the local paper. Well, some of us were!But the smartphone does so much of the work with computational photography and artificial intelligence these days, you do get a better photo if you upgrade to a new smartphone, at least today. But pick up a real camera and you’re lost…. the “auto” mode they stick in professional cameras is still meant to be used by a professional who understands photography. There’s no “photographer’s brain” stuck in that camera (yet), it’s behind the camera. So most people who become avid phone photographers and want to go further have a real problem switching to a big camera. Many give up.","38,612 followers",Kiara Bay,2.1K,526,55.5M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-advanced-technologies-are-only-used-by-military-organizations-and-not-by-anyone-else

What are some of the best Roman inventions still used today?A.By:Ancient Roman inventions gave shape to the Roman civilization as we know it today. Here is a list of top 10 ancient Roman inventions that led to major advances in engineering and innovations.10. ArchesEven though it predates Roman civilization, the arch became essential in general architecture paradigm once Romans made necessary changes to fit their designing schemes. Romans found out a way to set an arch on top of two tall pedestals such that it would span over a walkway (even highways). Many bridges, aqueducts, sewers, amphi-theaters and the Colosseum. The only known method forRoman city of BathThe Arch, although other civilizations used the arch in their architecture, its purpose was never really understood. When the arch is projected three dimensionally it can become a barrel vault. Another way of using this piece of architecture is when the arch is rotated around a single point it can become a dome.9. Grid based citiesEarliest of basic grid planning dates as far back as8. Sewers and sanitationThe7. Roads and highwaysRoman roads and highways played a pivotal role in the rise of the Roman state. In 700 years, they built 55,000 miles of paved highways, ensuring fast and efficient movement of goods, soldiers and information across the empire. Straight route across the countryside, making travel efficient and fast. Easy to navigate. Uuse road signs and mile markers.6. AqueductsEntire aqueduct network relied on gravity to maintain continuous flow – engineering remarkable for its time. Bigger cities like Rome, large reservoirs, connected to public baths, fountains, toilets and private villas.5. Roman numeralsRoman numerals4. Surgery tools and techniquesRoman medical scenario was heavily influenced by surgical advances achieved by ancient Greeks. Medical practitioners in ancient Rome also developed many new tools themselves and efficiently devised cesarean section. Biggest of leaps in battlefield related surgery by making medical preparedness and remedy in battle a prime concern. During reign of Augustus, medical corps assisted injured soldiers. Romans also mastered medical innovations to curb immediate blood loss in battles. Invented tools like bronze scalpels, obstetrical hooks, bone drills and forceps, and3. Julian calendarImposed months with odd number of days because of superstition against even numbers. Julius Caesar implemented reform, solar year as basis for calendar. He also instituted the 12 months in a year. Some Eastern Orthodox churches use it to calculate holidays even today. Even though it was a seemingly perfect innovation for its time, the Julian calendar miscalculated the solar year by about2. NewspaperSophisticated system to circulate written news published on Acta diurnal “Daily events”. Handwritten news sheets were published daily and posted in the Roman Forum. Content news on political happenings, trials, military campaign, executions, major scandals and other similar subjects. Acta Senatus recorded proceedings in the senate, though kept out of public reach until Julius Caesar made it accessible to everyone.1. ConcreteAncient Romans were particularly skillful in rapidly building new structures and maintaining. The revolutionary concrete developed by the Romans impeccable built and lasting formation – huge part in architectural accession of ancient Rome. It is superior to modern day concrete and more environment friendly. Romans combined their cement with volcanic rocks resulting in concrete that endured chemical decays. Pantheon, Colosseum and Roman forum standing since more than two millennia.PantheonColosseumConclusionFrom engineering marvels like aqueducts and arches to amazingly stable concrete, the ancient Romans succeeded in inventing and innovating their way to become one of the most prominent empires of the ancient world.
