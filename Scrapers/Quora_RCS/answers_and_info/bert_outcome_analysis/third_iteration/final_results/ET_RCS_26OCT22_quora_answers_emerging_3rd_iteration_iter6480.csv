1,"Predicting the evolution of any species, is pretty much impossible, given how it depends a lot on the environment the species is in, the ecology of the other organisms around them, diet/predation, and the mobility of genes in the population.But, what we can do is imagine what the human ecological niche would be without technology.Without shelters, fire, and clothing we would be unable to live in cold regions like most of Europe, Russia, Most of North America, Argentina.

And similar environments in the Americas. So, tropical to subtropical, near water.Without the ability to farm, cook, or cut up wild animals our diets would become very restrictive. And we would not be able to prey on large animals like cows. We would be eating lots of plants, fruits, nuts, bugs, small animals, maybe fish and rabbits, raw.All I can really guess, is that humans would evolve away from having pale skin, since that's a real handicap without clothing and shelter.And we would need better teeth, and we would probably get hairy. The food sources in the area would probably dictate our evolution.We might lose our long distance running endurance, since running down large prey is not much use if you can't spear it and cut it up.This thought experiment doesn't make much sense though, since tool use and pattern recognition is a key element of human brains, any population of humans without technology would begin to produce technologies straight away.",366 followers,Brett Alder,1.1K,0,0,2017,https://www.quora.com/How-would-we-evolve-if-we-had-no-technology

Evolution depends on new traits spreading toMost evolution occurs in small, geographically isolated populations facing new environments. Here again, technology has slowed the process. This time, it is transportation technology that means that populations are not isolated.
