In this Hypothetical, they would have access to all that they needed through the ir ally the USSR.So Britain could have received hundreds of V1 attacks per day. The aiming could be adjusted because German jets could fly reconnisance any time they wanted too.The “Ski” sites could have been put unto full operation with little hope of them being knocked out by air attack. This would mean that the Manned Luftwaffe could concentrate on the RAF leaving the area bombing to cruise missiles.In fact, in the real world, Britain should be VERY grateful that the V1 suffered some early stability problems. If they had been solved in 1943 then the whole war might have lasted another year or two.But when you put down all your intellectuals you don’t get high tech. I am firmly of the opinion that Hitler was planning for a war in 1944 and if that is what he had got he would have been far better equipped to fight it.","12,758 followers",Khalid Elhassan,3.7K,1.2K,38.2M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-if-the-Axis-had-their-peak-technologies-developed-in-1945-including-industry-and-infrastructure-at-the-start-of-the-war-Would-they-win

Proper landing ships like Marinefahrprahm might allow an invasion. Fritz X radio guided bombs would give a chance to Luftwaffe to beat RN from air. With 45 tech, Sea Lion still isn’t a sure thing, but doable. For Barbarossa, Much better anti tank wepons, Superior tanks compared to T-34 and KVs, better infantry weapons like assault rifles and panzerfausts, better supply vehicles like RSO would allow faster invasion than historical one. Moscow could fall. Still could have turned into a attrition war and stalemate but it depends on psychological factors.Germans had more hydrogeneration plants towards the end of war, if we assume they had also the 45 infrastructure (intact of course) that would alleviate fuel situation of 39–40. Either case, towards the end of war they were thinking putting Jumo diesels on tanks and that would also improve the fuel issue.Still I don’t think German atomic bomb project would have a great chance to produce a workable device before the Americans. It’s not impossible but given the stage of their development at 45 and priority of the project, it’s highly unlikely. So Germans would win in Europe, Americans got the bomb first. But probably Germans could develop the bomb not long after them (especially if they see its effects).","66,677 followers",Dima Vorobiev,1.7K,4.2K,139M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-if-the-Axis-had-their-peak-technologies-developed-in-1945-including-industry-and-infrastructure-at-the-start-of-the-war-Would-they-win

School hadn't let out and my oldest was not home but my youngest was. I asked where she was and he replied that he smacked her ass and sent her to bed. It wasnt even three in the afternoon and she was two years old so I immediately starting getting angry. His reasong for doing this was that she had pushed her Little Tykes car into the bathroom, got into the medicine cabinet and took an unopened box of antidepressants, opened it and ate them.I cannot even begin to describe my rage, it was full on war. In what reality does someone have to live in to think this is a normal response to a child getting into medications that mess with the chemicals in an adults brain?! I grabbed my daughter, called a cab and took her to the ER. Thankfully she had chewed through the box and only managed to eat one. She was up for three days straight but fine, nonetheless, I was a basket case from no sleep and trying to understand how he thought what he did was appropriate.That was the end of our relationship. Things became physical, there were PO's and an arrest, a new apartment and eventually a move back to our old state. I didnt trust him around our kids and I was not taking a chance of something happening that could not be reversed; my kids are my world, there lives are more important than our relationship ever was.Sidenote: he ended up in a relationship with another lady two years later. I found out he was doing coke heavily, she had a 16 year old daughter that had gotten coke from him to party with friends, she overdosed, went into a coma and came out with the brain of a ten year old. She will never have a normal life, that is what my kid could've ended up with, a life that is destroyed because of his recklessness.

Here's what China had to say about their imperial neighbors!From a translation by the University of Washington’s John E. Hill:“This country (the Roman Empire) has more than four hundred smaller cities and towns. It extends several thousand li in all directions. The king has his capital (that is, the city of Rome) close to the mouth of a river (the Tiber). The outer walls of the city are made of stone.“This region has pine trees, cypress, sophora, catalpa, bamboo, reeds, poplars, willows, parasol trees, and all sorts of plants. The people cultivate the five grains [traditionally: rice, glutinous and non-glutinous millet, wheat and beans], and they raise horses, mules, donkeys, camels and silkworms. (They have) a tradition of amazing conjuring. They can produce fire from their mouths, bind and then free themselves, and juggle twelve balls with extraordinary skill.“The ruler of this country is not permanent. When disasters result from unusual phenomena, they unceremoniously replace him, installing a virtuous man as king, and release the old king, who does not dare show resentment.“The common people are tall and virtuous like the Chinese, but wear hu(‘Western’) clothes. They say they originally came from China, but left it.“They have always wanted to communicate with China but, Anxi (Parthia), jealous of their profits, would not allow them to pass (through to China).”As a Latin and Classics nerd, I'm weirdly gratified for the ancient Chinese to give them such a good review. Here's a description of some of Rome's trade goods:“This country produces fine linen. They make gold and silver coins. One gold coin is equal to ten silver coins.“They have fine brocaded cloth that is said to be made from the down of ‘water-sheep’. It is called Haixi (‘Egyptian’) cloth. This country produces the six domestic animals, which are all said to come from the water.“It is said that they not only use sheep’s wool, but also bark from trees, or the silk from wild cocoons, to make brocade, mats, pile rugs, woven cloth and curtains, all of them of good quality, and with brighter colours than those made in the countries of Haidong (“East of the Sea”).“Furthermore, they regularly make a profit by obtaining Chinese silk, unravelling it, and making fine hu (‘Western’) silk damasks. That is why this country trades with Anxi (Parthia) across the middle of the sea. The seawater is bitter and unable to be drunk, which is why it is rare for those who try to make contact to reach China”.And here's even the directions how to get there:“The kingdom of Da Qin (Rome) is also called Lijian. It is west of Anxi (Parthia) and Tiaozhi (Characene and Susiana), and west of the Great Sea.“From the city of Angu (Gerrha), on the frontier of Anxi (Parthia), you take a boat and cut directly across to Haixi (‘West of the Sea’ = Egypt). With favourable winds it takes two months; if the winds are slow, perhaps a year; if there is no wind, perhaps three years.“The country (that you reach) is west of the sea (haixi), which is why it is called Haixi (literally: ‘West of the Sea’ = Egypt). There is a river (the Nile) flowing out of the west of this country, and then there is another great sea (the Mediterranean). The city of (Wu) Chisan (Alexandria) is in Haixi (Egypt).“From below this country you go north to reach the city of Wudan (Tanis?). You (then) head southwest and cross a river (the Sebannitus branch of the Nile?) by boat, which takes a day. You head southwest again, and again cross a river (the Canopis branch of the Nile?) by boat, which takes another day. There are, in all, three major cities [that you come to].“Now, if you leave the city of Angu (Gerrha) by the overland route, you go north to Haibei (‘North of the Sea’ – the lands between Babylonia and Jordan), then west to Haixi (Egypt), then turn south to go through the city of Wuchisan (Alexandria). After crossing a river, which takes a day by boat, you circle around the coast (to the region of Apollonia, the port of Cyrene). (From there, i.e. the region of Apollonia) six days is generally enough to cross the (second) great sea (the Mediterranean) to reach that country (Da Qin = Rome).”The Silk Road was approximately 4,000 miles (6,440 km) from its start in China to its end on the shore of the eastern Mediterranean. This compares with 2,440 miles ( 3930 km) between New York and Los Angeles, and 1,760 miles (2,830 km) between Paris and Moscow. Your city of Merv (3) is the largest city on the Silk Road. It sits at the main crossroads that connect the road’s starting points in China (1) and India (2) with its end point in the Roman Empire on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea (4).The Book of the Later Han, also known as the History of the Later Han and by its Chinese name Hou Hanshu, is one of the Twenty-Four Histories and covers the history of the Han dynasty from 6 to 189 CE, a period known as the Later or Eastern Han. The book was compiled by Fan Ye and others in the 5th century during the Liu Song dynasty, using a number of earlier histories and documents as sources.The section on the Treatise on the Western Regions was based on a report composed by Ban Yong (with a few later additions) and presented to Emperor An of Han in around 125. It presumably includes notes from his father Ban Chao. It forms the 88th chapter (or 118th chapter in some editions)[3] of the Book of the Later Han, and is a key source for the cultural and socio-economic data on the Western Regions, including the earliest accounts of Daqin (the Roman Empire), and some of the most detailed early reports on India and Central Asia. It contains a few references to events occurring after the death of Emperor An, including a brief account of the arrival of the first official envoys from Rome in 166.SOURCES:","29,930 followers",Tomaž Vargazon,1.6K,7.7K,249.7M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-if-the-Axis-had-their-peak-technologies-developed-in-1945-including-industry-and-infrastructure-at-the-start-of-the-war-Would-they-win

These regions are roughly comparible in size, have broadly similar advantages and disadvantages and each enables the formation of a major power that would be comparibly strong to the other three. This is exactly what happened historically, at different times.East of the Rhine you have Germany and beyond that the Eurasian steppe that also allows for formation of major agricultural powers at least, although it’s not as neatly enclosed as those four.You have the Mediterranean, an almost enclosed inland sea, with just a tiny breathing hole at the western edge and clearly separated into several distinct regions: western and eastern Mediterranean, Adriatic sea, another tiny breathing hole into the Black sea and of course a major city closing the Bosphorus and acting as an ancient capital. You have islands of enormous strategic value, Sicily is rich and fertile, Cyprus is essential for naval control of eastern Mediterranean. You have Balears, Greek islands and Malta, each with strategic value. South of that you have northen Africa, a narrow fertile strip of land on top of the Sahara desert that is not as rich, but still valuable to hold and as the same time not at all easy to take. You have Egypt, an agricultural powerhouse right nexto Jerusalem, a city coveted for spiritual reasons.You have Balkans, a tough land with marginal resources, limited by a major river - the Danube - which enables significant seaborne trade between the Black sea and the Eastern mark (Austria) and enables what would otherwise be an agricultural backwater to grow into a potential superpower.To the north you have Scandinavia, agriculturaly poor but endowned with vital mineral resources and well protected by frigid seas and harsh climate both.All this is before we even begin to consider the human geography, with Christianity and its own anticts of disunity of 1000 C.E., a later introduction of Islam who did the disunity thing even better, then the Protestant reformation. Linguistically you have three major groups (Germanic, Latin, Slavic) and at least three minor but nonetheless important groups (Greek, Ugro-Finnish, Baltic), before you even consider Turkish and Arabic (you might not count them under Europe). On top ofMost of this existed and was relevant in some fashion when Western Rome was still around.China is boring by comparisonBy contrast, China has a simple geographical map with one major flat region lining the coast from Bejing almost all the way down to Vietnam. Mountain ranges are all inland and do not separate the region into distinct areas of similar power. Major rivers all run west to east and do not open up areas for trade that would otherwise be locked in by mountain ranges. There are no regions that would be exceptionally different from the others and there is no way to create solid kingdoms closed in by solid mountain barriers, like with Spain and Italy, or else viable island kingdoms, such as the British isles. Korea and Japan could act in this manner, but both were tributary states to China, not parts of their empire and never able to challenge Chinese supierority anyhow.Human geography follows suit, with some 90% of population being Han chinese. Religion plays a far less important role in politics and society at large. There are occasional invasions of nomads from the north, but they usually just take over and get assimilated into the far larger agricultural society.In other words, whenever China fell apart like Rome did, there would eventually form a faction that would ultimately be able to unite the rich lands under one banner. In Europe this is far more difficult to achieve, for a myrad of reasons. This is why China is one empire and why no one was never able to recreate the glory and size Rome had under Titus.",7 followers,Michelle Zhou,3.7K,246,17.7M,2021,https://www.quora.com/When-in-our-past-did-we-know-we-werent-at-peak-technology

Let's throwI think Benedict Evans' answer was spot on. Battles are won and lost before they've even started. But for the sake of a bit of historical fantasy, let's try and see how this will pan out.First, we'll have to establish justIn relative terms, we'd be comparing the armies of Imperial Prussia at the battle of Sedan, with the armies of Oliver Cromwell.But you know what? Let's throw caution to the wind. Let's assume that Trajan's empire and all its contents were somehow transported back through time to 141 bc right next to an astonished Han Wudi, who then launched an invasion. LET'S MAKE THIS EPIC FACE OFF HAPPEN.AssumptionsConstraintsComparisonsBoth empires are roughly similar in size. However, the Romans have a huge logistical advantage; the Mediterranean Sea.Upon outbreak of war, Roman legions from the immediate areas around the Mediterranean can be rapidly mobilized, transported to Judaea and the Black Sea coast and sent onwards to the East. The limiting factor is sea-lift capability.Meanwhile the Han armies, limited to road-bound travel and logistics, would have difficulty redeploying with equal speed.Population estimatesThe Romans clearly had the upper hand in terms of population size.However, whereas the Han's population was homogenous and shared the same faith, value systems and language, Rome's population was disparate, and consisted of many Romanized tribes of varying faiths, languages, and cultures. In times of turmoil, shared identity is crucial as it determines how united the populace will be and the degree of collective sacrifice they will undertake in the face of an alien threat.Also, whereas the Han conscripts were free peasants called to defend the empire, up to 15% of the roman population were slaves, which disqualifies them for military service.Political systemsTrajan's position as emperor might seem all powerful, but closer inspection would reveal that his was a delicate balancing act. His very survival depended on the goodwill of the Praetorian guard, the Legions, and the Senate, while the loyalty of Rome's outlying provinces depended on the cooperation of the local and often romanized tribal nobility. While Trajan might count on their support initially, any defeats or major military disasters would rapidly diminish Rome's—and his—credibility and cause internal unrest.Han Wudi on the other hand, was God Emperor and supreme commander of the armed forces. Outlying kingdoms and marquessates were ruled by personally appointed relatives of the Imperial House, while provinces under the imperial government were administered by appointed governors. The eunuchs would not be able to assert their power until the Eastern Han. In the event of war, the Han's political structure would tolerate larger losses over a longer term than would Rome's.Military systemsArmy strengthGiven that the average legion had on paper 5000 legionaries, that would give the Imperial Roman Army a nominal strength of 150,000 legionaries and 230,000 auxilia. Given that the average Roman legionary served for 20 years up to a maximum of 25 years, we should find a large proportion of aged career soldiers in border duties and other static garrison roles who are largely unfit for sustained offensive operations, and a corresponding proportion of crack troops.Less is known of the strength of Han armies. What we do know however, is that in 141 bc, every male commoner upon reaching the age of 23 was liable for universal conscription with one year's training and one year's service. If we were to assume that the population distribution took a classic pyramid shape, and extrapolate the distribution based on the population pyramid of a developing country, for instance, Kenya:That would give us a standing Han army of roughly 362,500 trainees and 362,500 servicemen with a further 1,160,000 ex-servicemen between the ages of 25 to 29 available for call up.That would give us a standing Han army of roughly 362,500 trainees and 362,500 servicemen with a further 1,160,000 ex-servicemen between the ages of 25 to 29 available for call up.Within the 23-29 age group, the Romans would have 2,772,000 men. If we take away 15% to account for the slave population, and a further 200,000 to account for the existing legionaries and auxilia who would likely have fallen into that age group, that would leave Rome with 2,156,200 men available for call up. They do not however, have any military training, and would require a lengthy amount of time to mobilize, train, equip, organize, and deploy.Army organization and logistical capabilitiesThe Imperial Roman army was organized into 5 - 6000 man legions which were augmented by auxilia regiments. While the legionaries' equipment were standardized, the auxilia were comprised of widely disparate forces ranging from Cretan slingers, Numidian equites, and semi-barbaric Dacian foederati wielding clubs; all of which had varying degrees of organization, training and effectiveness.In the event of a hypothetical total war, the Han would be able to mobilize large armies faster, and make quick gains in Rome's Eastern Provinces. But Rome's superior numbers would eventually wear them out and force a stalemate.It must be said however, that while Qin and Han era armies had proven capable of fielding large armies of up to 700,000 men in a single battle, the largest Roman army ever deployed thus far was 86,000 strong at the battle Cannae. Operationally, the Han had proven able to concentrate manpower to larger degree than the Romans.ON TO THE BATTLE PORN!The Battle of Talas River. 141 BC.The epic clash between empires.Imperial Roman Army. 150,000 legionaries, 230,000 auxilia.Having not fought each other before, both armies did not know what to expect, and defaulted to their traditional tactics.DeploymentThe Han meanwhile, were constrained by geography and forced to deploy in two massive lines. Their left flank is bound by the Talas, while their cavalry is deployed on the right. A light cavalry screen is deployed in front.Due to their superior numbers, the Han felt confident and were obliged to advance. The Roman legionaries tightened their grip on their pila and braced for the melee.OpeningMeanwhile, Numidian equites skirmished with the opposing Han cavalry as they advanced towards the Roman left.Ever so slowly, the Han battle lines grinded forward under the hailstorm of javelins and stones.The volley.To the Romans' astonishment, the front ranks of the Han sat down and lay on their backs[1]. In the middle of a battle! They soon found out why.The first volley of crossbow bolts caught the legionaries by surprise and decimated their ranks. ""Testudo Formationem!"" the optios screamed, and the legionaries hastened to lock their shields.As you can see, the testudo formation provided good, but not complete protection from missiles.As you can see, the testudo formation provided good, but not complete protection from missiles.The legionaries were relatively safe from the barrage, but the auxilia were suffering heavy casualties. Trajan, recognizing the danger, pulled the auxilia back behind the main lines, and ordered his right flank to advance.CollisionThe Han conscripts were getting exasperated. They were expending masses of crossbow bolts to little effect on the testudines. While their bolts were capable of penetrating up to 1 cm of steel armor at a hundred paces, the interlocking shields of the legionaries rendered most of their barrage harmless. They were inflicting casualties on the legionaries, but not enough. It was simply not enough.The Roman advance was relentless.When they got to within 50 paces of the Han line, the legionaries braced, threw their pila, and rushed the Han battle line en masse. The unarmored Han crossbowmen fled. A protective screen of heavy Han infantry stood their ground, but they were outmatched. In close combat, Han lamellar armor proved no match for the steel lorica segmentata[1a].The Han infantry fell by the tens of thousands.The right flankThe orderA robed messenger ran up, bowed deeply on the dust filled ground, and held up a scroll. A message from the God Emperor.""Kill all before you""[2]. The second line sat down.The slaughterThen the volley came. Screams. Curses. More volleys every 30 seconds. Han and Roman alike fell by the thousands.RoutThe legions routed. The Han cavalry rode them down [3][4].Trajan fled to Judea, and the entire Roman Empire was called up to war.[1] Qin and Han era crossbowmen would often lay on their backs and use their feet to anchor their crossbows as they drew the bolt with their hands. They also employed firing drills with one rank firing while another rank was reloading. The Romans had arcuballistas, but were not deployed on the scale of Han armies.[1a] Though later Han armies were equipped with steel armor, early Han armies wore Qin style lamellar armor. As no one knows precisely when steel Han armor became widespread, this article assumes that Han Wudi's army was equipped with Qin era weaponry and armor.[2] Very plausible. Chinese court historians generally do not pay much attention to peasant casualties, and would round up casualty numbers to the nearest hundred thousand. An indication, perhaps, that the lives of peasant conscripts weren't worth very much in ancient China.[3] The greatest slaughter during ancient battles was not during, but after the battle.[4] Hey, someone had to win.

In fact, in the armor and shOf all the answers I’ve seen,A bloody draw is a likely answer.Technology-IntroductionRome was past Iron Age at this point. Certainly, their ability to construct siege weaponry, fortifications, and armor put them quite ahead of the pack. In fact, in the armor and shielding category, I’d put them ahead of the Chinese.However, to counter this, Chinese crossbow and ranged fire technology is significant. I’m not sure about the armor-piercing power, but as the Parthians have proved before, Tetsudos are not invincible. You can whittle them down with enough discipline and firepower.In armor, the Romans used segmented plate armor, which in my personal opinion offers a greater deal of protection compared to the lamellar armor commonly found in China. While both are very, very effective, I’d give the edge to the Romans here.Technology-SiegeIn terms of siege weaponry, while Rome was certainly more specialized with greater amounts of recorded weaponry, the common, near-constant occurrence of war in China, especially against border tribes and each other, did propel Chinese siege technology forward significantly. Rome was stronger on the offense; being a force with catapults/ballistae (Caesar used the terms interchangably in hisHowever, in terms of the Chinese, almost all ancient cities in China were walled and protected, unlike those of the Romans. Moreover, Chinese armies also constructed fortified camps. From records seen in the Three Kingdoms to battles during the Warring States, entire military texts covered how to protect your armies on the march and in entrenchment. In defensive capability, battlements and towers, barbicans and moats, were often city-wide in scale, something only rarely seen during late Rome, when the capacity of moving Roman infantry was no longer enough to stop invasions. Moreover, Chinese walls were thicker, by a considerable degree. Seen today, some of these walls reached over 20 meters thick, considerably greater than than 3 to 4 meters seen in the Severian walls.It would take considerably more effort for Roman soldiers to fight their way through these defensive cities.Technology-MetallurgyRoman and Han metallurgy both reached high states of sophistication at this point. The fact that we can still find Qin halberd heads that are apparently still sharp is a testament to Chinese military technology of the period. Certainly, I doubt that either side would hold too much of an advantage in this category. While the Roman thrusting sword might be able to get through Chinese armor in a direct strike, the same can be said of a heavy halberd tip striking a Roman helmet.Armor-wise, Rome holds the advantage with its superior design. While the Chinese design is certainly effective, combined perhaps with silk underneath, it nonetheless had not reached the highly specialized degree available to Rome. It should be noted, however, that the Han have access to stronger iron shields, though the weight might end up as a disadvantage.Technology-CavalryHere, the Han hold the distinct advantage. Stirrups. These were what gave birth to the powerful shock cavalry seen in Medieval Europe, and they were widely available to China, whose northern plains were essential breeding grounds for warhorses.Rome was never particularly good against cavalry, having neither the long pike formations available to the Greeks or heavy cavalry of their own. In fact, it is likely the reason why they could never truly defeat the Parthians. Open combat across such wide desert, where the enemy’s speed and range is so far above yours, is detrimental to Roman forces.Technology-NavalRoman forces were certainly superior in navigation, having inherited Carthagian technology (by stealing it), and with experience against the Greeks. In the open sea, I doubt the Chinese would stand a chance, since they have no enemies on the outside. The battle at Actium, at least, show that the Romans were certainly capable of using and fighting in the open sea. Ramming would be a common tactic, as would be boarding.In river combat, China could prove superior. River systems in China were longer and more developed, leading to far more conflicts centered around control of flowing water. The result was a highly developed brown water force, seen in full force at battles such as the Red Cliff (though this is a little later than the Han dynasty). Boarding and setting fire to enemy ships were both common tactics.Open Battle-IntroductionWeapons-wise, China holds the range advantage. Used to open plains combat and combined arms of a higher degree than seen by Alexander, China’s forces are highly effective at dealing with all sorts of enemy forces. A focus on heavy cavalry and ranged cavalry is prominent, along with liberal use of chariots; However, it certainly does not mean that the Han’s infantry is lacking. In particular, ranged infantry offers a higher degree of discipline and skill than Roman equivalents, who are forced to rely on auxiliaries.TrainingContrary to expectations, Chinese military training was nationalized by the Han dynasty, with at least a year’s worth of training. However, volunteer forces were available, and likely trained to a far higher degree. This does, however, pale in comparison to Rome’s legionary training, which could take over a decade of service.Roman training was highly specialized, and their ability as engineers, forces on march, and organized formations was superior. However, as the Chinese have codified and extensively expanded their military theory by the Han period, it should be expected that higher-level commanding officers should be superior on the Chinese side. Rome, on the other hand, is less well-known for their theory-craft, something which can prove surprisingly lethal on the campaign. In conclusion, we should expect Roman troops to be better trained with higher morale, but Roman officers to be worse than their Chinese counterparts in combat. Military law seems to be equally well-developed on both sides, with codes and regulations being a regular matter.TacticsThis is the trickiest part, since in a large aspect, these depend on the commander. Romans, contrary to their image, are quite effective at multiple forms of combat, from open field battle to sieges and ambushes. The battle of Alesia, the siege of Carthage, and others remain hallmarks of Roman success. Roman ingenuity allowed their navy to develop and grow, as did their use of auxiliary forces.However, Rome’s performance is best in lightly-wooded, hilly regions, where terrain makes the use of medium-sized, organized formations effective. In heavy forests, Roman troops perform rather poorly, unable to use their logistical advantage or their formations fully. In open plains, the crippling lack of cavalry means any organized enemy cavalry force could make mince-meat of them.China, on the other hand, does best in the open plain. The Han, being a prominent Northern power, specializes in heavy cavalry. Used to fighting nomadic tribes such as the Xiongnu, and each other, Chinese forces were effective combatants both in open plain and in ambush. However, without steep mountainous terrain or in mud and swamps, Chinese forces are likely to flounder, since they rely on a combined arms strategy with high levels of planning and coordination.China was familiar with formations such as shield wall, pike lines, and even turtle formation. It would not be too difficult for them to whittle down Roman formations, perhaps even pitting a halberd line against a Roman maniple. Romans do hold an advantage in close combat, since practice with the gladius and scutum would make Roman soldiers better close combat forces, but the Chinese, again, have the cavalry advantage, able to both shoot from range and charge into unbraced Roman formations with no long spears to hold them at bay.LogisticsRoman logistics are more efficient. Their ability to move troops rapidly around their empire and to construct buildings and cities in standardized fashion was superior to that of the Chinese. However, the Chinese hold advantages in agriculture, as their default crop of rice provides better yields than corresponding wheat. Moreover, Chinese cities are far better protected, with garrisons of thousands defending thick walls and tall towers. This would mean, in a total war, it’s harder for Rome to defend its territories, as Chinese armies could face the Romans in open combat without fearing the loss of their cities, while Roman forces must choose between constructing heavy fortifications (and these fortifications cannot be simply wooden walls or small camps, since the Chinese hold significant siege technologies in siege towers, mangonels, and the like), and facing the Chinese in battle with their cities unwalled. Rome, for example, was an open settlement before the Severian Walls were put in.In terms of willingness to fight, both sides seem to be able to suffer huge casualties without losing their morale. Rome demonstrated this during the Punic Wars, and China’s long history of civil wars and battles against nomadic tribes is good evidence of this on their side.China can put up a huge number of soldiers. But the ability to maintain that army in the field depends, on a large part, on the ability of the commanding staff of the Chinese general. It seems that while officers were trained in military theory, the resulting application was not as uniform as the Roman legions’ doctrine.ConclusionsWhile both Rome and China hold individual advantages in a hypothetical war, it is likely that neither side could gain a true edge over the other in battle. Along the coast, in hilly terrain such as in Greece, and in any sea battle, the Romans hold the edge. Their discipline would mean that their troops could be deployed rapidly and with high efficiency.On large stretches of terrain or in river combat, however, the Chinese hold the advantage. I find it likely that the Chinese could have pushed further north into Germany if they were in the same situation as the Romans. In the deserts of the Middle East, where any combat would be likely to happen, China holds the advantage. I surmise it may be possible for China to push through what used to be Parthia toward the Mediterranean, while Rome holds the coast and is able to successfully block any further ingress that way. A subsequent campaign by the Han northward around the Black Sea would falter due to logistic issues, or an attack on Constantinople could be stopped by the Roman navy. A counter attack southward through Egypt by the Romans will fail for similar reasons. The length of supply lines on each side would be so great that frankly, any war would end up in a begrudging agreement that a few scraps of land past the wealthy cities of the East would hardly be worth it.","21,081 followers",Dimitris Almyrantis,2.1K,2.4K,21.7M,2018,https://www.quora.com/When-in-our-past-did-we-know-we-werent-at-peak-technology

If you are talking about the fall of Western Europe in 476, its economic decline did not meant that a closer empire would conquer it as the closest non-Roman candidate to conquer Rome was Sassanid Persia yet they were blocked by the Eastern Roman Empire.Yet Rome fell not because of the Barbarians fault, many of whom were forced to migrate from the Hunnic conquests an pillage. Rome fell because the government was losing money and state centralization in part by wars and revolutions that come in an empire’s age, also because of lack of centralization latin began to mingle with Germanic and other local languages causing division and the Barbarians, many of whom were Roman allies (especially the goths) were hired to be involved in wars, security and government etc.Imagine for a moment living in Western Europe, you witness the fall and the poverty it created, people stopped creating monuments, great arquitecture, running water and roads and started living locally in farms and wells. Yet after suffering all this the ones who tried to conquer those lands was non other than your Eastern Roman brothers and they see you as a non-Roman threat and almost succeeded!Imagine the Spanish trying to conquer the Americas but instead of the Indigenous people dying from diseases, the Spanish themselves start do die by a Black Death equivalent of a lethal desease, that´s what happened with the Eastern Roman Empire, so Western Europe seemed to be saved almost by luck.Imaging sighting “Ah, that was close” Then suddenly, the Arabs conquered all of Persia, most of the Eastern Roman Empire and Spain!Take in mind many Western Europeans had mingled with Roman, Rome fell but the Romans still holded positions in power, many priests and monks had Roman blood and even some Kings and royal family were Romans, although its very hard to know exactly as many tried to hide it (probably in part by growing beards, cough, Carolignian Dynasty, cough) and they didn´t had DNA tests.Then in the year 800 Charlemagne gets crowned Roman Emperor by possibly a Pope of Roman ancestry (The Pontifix Maximus used by popes was borrowed from such titles used by Roman Emperors).The papal States, of whom were created from Roman land, remaining from the Byzantine reconquests and probably were fully Roman themselves, started to gain power in Western Europe and the Holy Roman Empire might have been the first attempt to revive Rome or might have been more like an attempt for survival and than empire building, as the Franks were not as advance as even the Emirate of Cordoba.However, unity fell probably because they were attacked by the Vikings and the kingdom fragmented into pieces, peaces who were at war with each other, however because of the Vikings they started creating castles around the 1,000th century.The Byzantine Empire was weakened and the Muslims were divided and fighting between themselves and were stopped by the Franks as it was way too far away from their supply lands, so it seems that Semi-Roman Western Europe would not be conquered, at least not until the Mongols arosed in the 13th century and conquered Russia!Semi-Roman Western Europe seemed to be doomed until the Khan died and they had to go back to the heartland to chose a new leader by tradition, so the conquest of Europe was haulted and then saved by infighting between Mongolians and the Empire was divided like Alexander the Great´s.Medieval Europe was saved onced more until the Black Death happened. But at least the Europeans are saved from external threads and the Spanish Reconquista is kicking the Muslims out by help from European crusading alliances.Then Europe could finally rest until the Turks conquered world powers like Arab Egypt, Hungary and what was left of the Roman Empire! The mother of your world!It seemed like Europe could just not just have enough rest although they got lucky over and over again but something different happened. The Conquest of Constantinople and the defeat of the Byzantium Empire kick started the Renaissance (a period in which Western Europe started to copy Greco-Roman culture and technology) and it seemed like the Western Roman Empire, who was never conquered, just collapse and fragmented, had revived as it also had time to recover and refind itself. I dont think anything similar happened in world history when an Empire collapsed but was never conquered and given a time to breath, maybe except for China.",152 followers,Alex Mann,845,2K,102.7M,2021,https://www.quora.com/When-in-our-past-did-we-know-we-werent-at-peak-technology

And you  are asking me which empire would won a war between. Isn't it an easy question to answer.
