2,"No. This mess was started by Eric van Däniken in his book, chariots of the gods. He has been proven I hope so long ago. The Carvings he claims represent extraterrestrials are gods or nature symbols. For example, he points out images of turtles (saucers) and fish (rockets) in Taiwan. Taiwan is an island.

Where and how you start your blog has become very different than what it used to be.Challenges faced in bloggingThe reason why internet marketers say blogging “is dead” is because people are still spending time and energy writing blog posts on their personal website but not getting the organic traffic that they’re used to.  There’s nothing wrong with having a blog on a personal website--I have one. But the problem is that nobody knows how to drive traffic to their site to read their writing in the first place. Nobody is doing the work to master the art of SEO, or Facebook dark posts, or Pinterest, or answering questions on Quora or anything else that can drive to their personal blog or website.Social networking as a blogThink about it: Starting a blog has never been easier with Snapchat, Twitter, Facebook, and Medium.Social media has become a new version of blogging. Take Twitter for example. Twitter was known flatout as a microblogging platform. Now people are using platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and Medium to get them more exposure than a just posting on a personal website does. As a matter of fact, I’m even asking people to write book reviews on Instagram for the #AskGaryvee Book instead of on their personal blog. My advice would be to try putting out native content on the platforms that make most sense for you and your audience. Then, start engaging with those who you think should see it.Driving Traffic to your BlogWhat has happened over the last decade is that the attention graph, the visualization of where people’s attention is right at this very moment and where can you meet them, is shifting. People’s willingness to jump somewhere to consume content is certainly not down, but their willingness to leave the platform they are already engaging on (Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat) is. To get them to click out, you have to be smart. Really smart.Jab,Jab,Jab, Right Hook - Being Smart about itSomething I’m really passionate about (and I’d like to think my book Jab, Jab, Jab, Right Hook helped with this) is that social shouldn’t be used purely for awareness. It’s true that that’s part of what social media is there for, and that’s great, and it’s fun to create “viral content”, but it’s massively naive for companies to ignore social’s DR and sales capabilities. I’m excited to see more and more brands throwing right hooks (which is to say going in for the ask) and treating social media as a way to funnel in viewers, and not just broad awareness platforms. It’s not about putting out as much content out there as you can. It’s about learning what drives your users. Find out what they care about and engage with them.Remember: Just because you jab and jab and jab, doesn’t mean you’re automatically going to drive audience members to your blog. It just allows you to have the audacity to drive them there. Putting out great content and see what resonates with your audience.To Sum it all up, while the term “blogging” has evolved to become more than just having a personal blog or website, don’t feel like you need to abandon traditional blogging. Instead, learn how you can use these social media to drive traffic to your site. Try engaging your audience using social media to really understand what drives your users. Start by putting out great content nuggets on the platforms that make the most sense for you and your audience. Test headlines, test out different syndication platforms. The bottom line is that you can’t just blog and expect people to come to you. The key is that you need to start engaging with those who you think should see it.","59,229 followers",Gary Vaynerchuk,580,154,19.1M,2016,https://www.quora.com/Who-were-the-top-10-most-influential-bloggers-in-the-Philippines-in-2014-especially-in-technology

I'm getting better.Him: So. . . how are you going to monetize?At which point I throw my husband a look and he starts talking about his job because it is something which we - especially my father - can understand.This pathetic interchange is not my Dad's fault. It's mine. I didn't know what I was doing, I didn't have goals, and thus - I couldn't communicate my production, process, success, focus, or anything.In the absence of my own goals, my Dad created them for me, and they were wrong.Lately, there has been a shift in the conversation. Dad asks me how many followers etc. I have, and I say, ""Dad, my goal is to get better at writing. Everything I do is to improve my writing. So if you want to ask me about my writing, ask me about my writing, not views, followers, etc. Ok?"" And then he does.When you create a blog, the first thing you figure out is: are you writing to WRITE or are you writing to BE SEEN?They aren't mutually exclusive, I love being seen and heard, of course. But my decisions about content, my time, my success etc. are all tied to my primary goal of becoming a better writer.Everything I do, I first ask ""Will this make me a better writer?""If I were blogging to BE SEEN, I'd ask ""Will this get me more views, more hits, more likes?"" That would lead me to different decisions, outcomes, and choices. More listicles, more articles about Failure, and Sucking and Success. And personally, it would make me unhappy because it is not all I want to do.When I started writing fiction, someone told me it was a mistake because I lost fans. I thought, ok too bad, but is my fiction any good? I don't know yet. But that is what I want to find out. If it is, fans will come. If not, at least I know.Save yourself indigestion later on by figuring this out now. What is the PRIMARY point of your blog? As a tool to be a good writer? Or as a tool to be seen and heard and possibly influence people? There is no good or bad answer, whether you are a writer or a writer/marketer, that is fine.But you need to defineYou'll be glad you did.","4,624 followers",Matt Wyndowe,593,69,1.4M,2016,https://www.quora.com/Is-it-true-that-space-technology-was-found-in-archaeological-excavations-and-its-being-kept-top-secret
