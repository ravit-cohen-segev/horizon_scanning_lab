This very well could change how we live. Right now if you want an engineering job, publishing job or big law job you have to live in an expensive urban area. If you could cut that down to having to go to your office once a week I see two different things happening at once. People can start living farther away which might reduce the cost of living in the heart of a city but it will increase the cost of living farther away and cause smaller areas to have to provide more services to people staying home.The other change I see is automation of low-level low experience jobs. For example right now self-checkouts and online ordering is cutting into the number of cashiers that are being employed. Other than answering questions, much of what happens in a store for example can be automated. The first thing is this eliminates one path for teens to start into the workforce.

4,"I have a working proof of concept prototype of a Centrifugal propeller. A video of it is posted on YouTube. I am within a couple of weeks from having a practical purpose prototype that will actually lift into the air. The Centrifugal Propeller will replace all jet engines, rockets, and most air and marine propellers. It will also be used for lifting purposes both commercially and domestically. It has no speed limit in outer space because it will continually accelerate.","135,544 followers",Hector Quintanilla,582,1.2K,88.6M,2020,https://www.quora.com/In-the-next-10-years-which-emerging-technology-will-change-our-lives-the-most-Why

13,"Yes, of course.The combustion of coal as originally practised produced lots of pollutants. A 1987 US Senate Bill defined clean coal technology thus:""The term clean coal technology means any technology...deployed at a new or existing facility which will achieve significant reductions in air emissions of sulfur dioxide or oxides of nitrogen associated with the utilization of coal in the generation of electricity.”In the early part of the 21st century, the term was either expanded to include (or more likely be confused with) technologies to reduce some of the CO2 emissions.What many people do notYes, of course.The combustion of coal as originally practised produced lots of pollutants. A 1987 US Senate Bill defined clean coal technology thus:""The term clean coal technology means any technology...deployed at a new or existing facility which will achieve significant reductions in air emissions of sulfur dioxide or oxides of nitrogen associated with the utilization of coal in the generation of electricity.”In the early part of the 21st century, the term was either expanded to include (or more likely be confused with) technologies to reduce some of the CO2 emissions.What many people do not realise (or choose not to) is that the energy from coal comes primarily from the reaction:C + O2 = CO2 + heatThere is essentially no way of getting the heat without the CO2. If you convert the CO2 into anything else that will require energy as it is a low energy compound. Converting it into a fuel for example will use up more energy than you got out.However, if you are going to capture CO2 and store it somewhere, it makes sense in chemical engineering to deal with it at source when it is in maximum concentration. Thus if you were to burn a processed clean coal with oxygen you would get something close to pure CO2, which then only needs to be compressed and/or liquefied to go to the storage facility.The most plausible actual use is to put the CO2 into depleted oil and gas reservoirs to force out more of the hydrocarbon fuel.CO2 can be converted into a liquid fuel or plastic by combining it with hydrogen, but all of these processes cause an energy loss, commonly explained as being made up by “renewable energy”. If this was available in sufficient quantities, one might ask why the coal is being burned at all.Another system often branded clean coal technology is Underground Coal Gasification which uses a combination of combustion and steam to produce a mixture of gases which can then be burned. Essentially some of the coal is burned to give the energy for part of it to be converted with water into a mixture of gases CO, CH4 and H2. This intrinsically leaves most of the ash down in the ground and reduces particles and sulfur and nitrogen compounds in the gases (which can still be further cleaned).However, fundamentally it adds just as much CO2 to the atmosphere as conventional combustion, though may be cheaper and extends coal reserves to those not practical to work by mining.If coal continues to be used (as it will) it makes sense to use it as cleanly and efficiently as possible. However there is no magic way of getting the energy without producing CO2.To my mind any underground storage is an additional process which delays the release of CO2, not really coal technology at all.",652 followers,Al Barleta,11.6K,219,1.8M,2019,https://www.quora.com/In-the-next-10-years-which-emerging-technology-will-change-our-lives-the-most-Why
14,"Coal, for power generation, is already very safe, usable, efficient and clean - provided it is used in an up-to-date power station. Many decades of innovation and hard work have gone into all of these, so the technology is fairly mature. There is some research on-going, but not a lot, because (a) competition from natural gas and a vicious and misguided “green” campaign against coal has made it less attractive, and (b) the growth in coal usage is mainly in less advanced countries where there is no demand for further improvement.","9,989 followers",Brett Bergan,679,7K,83.6M,2020,https://www.quora.com/In-the-next-10-years-which-emerging-technology-will-change-our-lives-the-most-Why
