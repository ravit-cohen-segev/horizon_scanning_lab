Kurzweil noted an acceleration of the exponential with the introduction of solid state devices. This suggests a hyperbolic rather than an exponential growth. So, things are speeding up not slowing down.Doubtless future developments will proceed to new forms as they become available and we reach the limits of planar integrated circuits. These new platforms will include;These are not mutually exclusive and there are synergies connecting them together.Alan Turing developed a conceptual machine that carried out a program or algorithm and this is the basis of all computing in a mathematical sense.Here’s a totally mechanical version that is built in wood that could have been built any time since Turing devised the concept.Here data is stored by sliding a peg back and forth in a link that forms a chain which forms the tape. The peg is read mechanically as well, since the peg closes a linkage that engages a gear train that carries out the ‘truth table’ within the machine. Programs are written by positioning the pegs in the chain link tape and running them through the processor and then read off the answer by looking at the pattern of pegs after running the program.Here is a kinesin molecule that ‘walks’ along a microtuble carrying a vesicle.Here is how DNA replicates and expresses proteins. This shows how Helicase and other molecules process DNA to reproduce it and use it to make proteins.The similarity of these processes to Turing machinery described in 1936 has not been lost on some biologists and computer scientists.

Molecules that move along the nanotube and shift the molecules around in response to their position have the capacity to read and write information and implement a Turing machine at the molecular scale.Armchair single-walled nanotubeZig-Zag single-walled nanotube (note each hexagon rotates 60 degrees around the tube. These are not the only configurations. Slice open the tube and lay it flat forming a monomolecular layer of graphene and the strip may be oriented any number of ways.The narrowest zig zag type is 738 picometers in circumference and 234.9 picometers in diameter. Spacing along the edges is 142 picometers. There are six positions that a molecule attached to the surface may take during each rotation.Three molecules shifted one position left or right stores 3 bits of information per rotation. Coded as three units in a group stores 8 bits of information 000 to 111 stores one byte per molecular length of the nanotube. Changing the chirality changes the length of this to 6 bits which permit hexadecimal storage with a check bit.Using the simplest approach a total of 14.2 gigabytes per meter. 1 km of this tube is 283.56 picograms. That’s 4*10^26 bits/kg.A 12.89 km long tube containing 182.95 trillion bytes of information is wrapped into a spherical shell 23 microns in diameter forming 2985 layers 1 micron thick and massing 3.655 nanograms.Helicase type molecules encase the strand and operate like Turing read write heads which move nitrogen molecules between two locations on the carbon nanotube surface to encode information. The helicase molecules process a billion locations per second and several operate along the length of each molecule. A Motorola 64k IC has been reduced to a 128,000 byte Turing tape which operates UNIX, using byte pairs to encode information along the nanotube.https://www.researchgate.net/publication/231713010_Capillary_Phase_Transitions_of_n-Alkanes_in_a_Carbon_Nanotubehttp://www.sci-news.com/othersciences/chemistry/carbyne-ultra-long-1d-carbon-chains-03770.htmlA one dimensional carbyne molecule passes through the center and responds to the helicase type kinesin molecule providing power to the unit. Every 128,000 intervals the single walled nanotube is stitched together with a multi-walled nanotube. This multi-walled nanotube is equipped with acceleration sensors, light sensors, light emitters, photovoltaic molecules and various receptor molecules for water vapour and carbon dioxide specifically.These multiwalled tubes provide power to the computing strands and the computing strands control the behaviour of the connecting tubes. In this way the tube grows flexes and performs a variety of functions. The coil collects CO2 at the receptor and separates the molecule with solar power, and transports carbon gathered in this way to the end of the tube extending it. When the foglet shell is 2 microns thick the shell splits in two hemispherical shell halves, and the broken ends of the extended spiral anneal to the broken ends of the original spiral and the new spiral flexes outward creating a copy of the original sphere.When not reproducing the shell grows 12 arms equally spaced, each of these arms has the same computing and operational setup as the sphere.Information and energy is sent along the length of the tube. A single 23 micron diameter shell contains 1 billion processors each running UNIX at 1 billion introductions per second and each as capable of a PDP 11/70 of the 1970s!! These are the heart of each self replicating foglet. Trillions of foglets operate together to form smart matter that self assemble into anything desired.One of the world's smallest electronic circuits created15 nanometer structures 3.45 trillion bits per gram. 4.10*10^23 bits per gram of the molecular device above isln(4.10*10^23/(3.45*10^12))/ln(2) = 36.79 doublings 73.58 years ~2094 ADAssuming exponential growth. However, as mentioned previously growth in capacity is hyperbolic tending toward infinity in the 2035 to 2040 time frame.I can see this with modern personal supercomputers. I model all these chemical things at the molecular level and use atomic force microscopes to pattern the graphene into strips and deposit other molecules on to those strips and cause them to fold up in highly controlled ways.
