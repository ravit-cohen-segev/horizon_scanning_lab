1,"Most of the advances have been in improving the directory capabilities, not the underlying file transfer protocols. The underlying protocol is pretty good and robust, and it would take a lot of motivation to want to change it.A similar situation exists with TCP and HTTP, there they are both largely good enough, but strongly motivated groups like Google are dreaming up QUIC/HTTP3 in hopes it will be better and people will move.It’ll take something on the scale of a Google to push something better than torrents, and there aren’t many that would be motivated.

2,"Do you honestly think they are telling this to the public?Also, a lot of spy “tehnology” is old fashioned leg work guided ay smart minds. Cause your enemy to think that what exists is not what really exists but some fabrication you have cooked up and then attack him from nowhere in his noetic horizon and he collapses psychologically and you may win without fighting or just fighting a flailing adversary who is in a panic not rationally fighting you. Of course technology can help, but a chain is only as strong as its weakest link and that is often not the hardware, but the orgware: the humans whDo you honestly think they are telling this to the public?Also, a lot of spy “tehnology” is old fashioned leg work guided ay smart minds.

Donitz’s u-boat radio operators often ended their very securely enigma machine encrypted messages with a very securely encrypted “Heil Hitler”. The code breakers had a hunch, and pounced on that.

3,"National Technical Means - Spy Satellites, has now been superseded by cyber attacks to steal as much secret technical information as a country has. The US has been leaking truckloads of highly sensitive technical and national security information to China and Russia for over a decade as their cyber teams run rings around the US, for little to no cost, and with no accountability.","68,802 followers",Kanthaswamy Balasubramaniam,898,17.3K,413.7M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Is-there-a-possibility-of-emerging-peer-to-peer-p2p-technology-that-is-more-widely-used-than-BitTorrent-at-this-time
4,"I won't describe it as the most advanced but I will certainly place it as a spy equipment that is easy and legal to obtain: software defined radio (SDR).You can do almost anything with it such as:1. You can confirm the presence of data transmission anywhere from almost DC to 6 GHz of frequency.2. With a lot more knowledge you can record it, demodulate it, characterize it, and decode it.3. With a high gain antenna you can infer direction.All that can be done with only a SDR receiver.

This is another way of saying that you can listen to anyone using wireless communications such as cellphones, radios, wifi, satcomm, etc. that is very very illegal to do but no one civilian will ever know you are doing it because you would be sniffing at the physical layer.If you had an SDR full duplex transceiver you can build portable radars, and much more that could be put in the ""spy equipment"" category. All SDR I know are unregulated and legal to obtain. The illagal part can arise from its use as you cannot transmit on licensed frequencies but that is a risk that the user should be aware of.","5,990 followers",Jens Böttiger,566,2.6K,17.6M,2016,https://www.quora.com/What-advancements-have-emerged-in-spy-technology
5,"Technology.I lean towards being a singularian, that is:  I think technology will change EVERYTHING from the fabric of our being to the very way we live our lives, if we're even alive at that point.  I'm not gonna' go all Kurzweil and say when it's gonna happen (or even guess), but the moment you make machines that can make themselves, you unlock exponential growth potential that basically takes you to the physical limits of the materials being used.One of the key things to understand about -- for example -- American intelligence is that it is concerned with makingTechnology.I lean towards being a singularian, that is:  I think technology will change EVERYTHING from the fabric of our being to the very way we live our lives, if we're even alive at that point.

What's the tipping point of having verifiable models (like weather models) of entire nation states that accurately forecast how that nation will behave a few weeks out, crunching every single shred of public and private and secret data that the NSA (or another agency) can hoover-up and crunch into an array of supercomputers?That's an awfully interesting -- and dangerous -- power to have.That's the future of espionage.  To make it happen, spy agencies like the NSA and NGA needWhat happens if that array of computing systems has even a hint of self-awareness and the ability to crunch all of that data with near instantaneousness, using that intelligence to extrapolate the chaotic nature of human engagements?  The potential EVEN without A.I. is massive.  The potential with it scares the fuck out of me.","246,857 followers",Dushka Zapata,1.5K,8.5K,232.5M,2014,https://www.quora.com/What-advancements-have-emerged-in-spy-technology

Memory bandwidth bordering the insanity.On benchmarks it is not compared to other processors, it is compared to GPUs.Oh and all Xeons aren't made to work alone, but are heavily optimized to work in group with other Xeons.GeForce GTX 1080 Ti Graphics Card3584 cores.And this beast is used for games.Of course it can be used also for science, there is indeed a well documented API, though it is marketed for gaming.Ever wondered if you canOr a kind of peripheral that sorts a limited array ofFPGAStratix 10 - OverviewIntel Altera FPGAs, are as close you can get to nanometer programmable matter.Field Programmable Gate Array is a fancy way to say that everything inside that big fat black chip is completely under your control.Want to stuff in 8 big CPUs or 256 adder cores? Within minutes you can try both.They can emulate any circuit at high speeds, manage hundreds of lines and emulate high speed peripherals like HDMI or USB3.One core application is to elaborate video filters in real time with no delay at all.There are even cheap ones starting at about 20 bucks.Direct brain to computer interfacesIn the comments I heard complains like, “hey commercial things can't be the most advanced thing, right?”.And they are right.Because research is ongoing to command computers with just your brain!The headgear in the image, I still haven't got a chance to use, but trying lesser capable versions, they do work and with minimal training anybody can drive a small robot with thoughts.Homepage - EmotivWith anybody I mean I've tested it on more than 150 people, with less than 5 minutes of training. It was possible with just 1 channel, where the headgear above promises 14 so theorically more complex commands could be given.In general, it depends on what you consider important, but as an hardware developer I’m quite filled with wonder every time I dig in data sheets and find that even cheap sensors indeed have inside tiny ad hoc microcontrollers.","1,594 followers",Michael Van In,631,1.5K,2.9M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-advancements-have-emerged-in-spy-technology
