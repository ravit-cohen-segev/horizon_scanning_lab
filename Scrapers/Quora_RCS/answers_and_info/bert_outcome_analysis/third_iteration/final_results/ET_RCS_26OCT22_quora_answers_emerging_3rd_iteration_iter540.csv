2,"That’s a long ways away, so it’s hard to say what the market will look like 10 years from now. But given the way things are going, deep learning is becoming a bigger field. Now you asked about 3 things, big data, machine learning, and deep learning. I wouldn’t think of these as three distinct subfields. Big data simply describes a subset of data science that has at least 2 of the “3 v’s” (Velocity, volume, variety). If a large amount of data is coming in very quickly, it’s considered big data. As is a small amount of data with a high degree of variance that is coming in quickly. It’s sort of aThat’s a long ways away, so it’s hard to say what the market will look like 10 years from now.

If a large amount of data is coming in very quickly, it’s considered big data. As is a small amount of data with a high degree of variance that is coming in quickly. It’s sort of a misnomer, I realize. Machine learning and deep learning, on the other hand, are methods of analysis performed on data (big data or otherwise). So to answer your question properly, I’ll say that data is always getting “bigger”. We’re producing more and more of it and we’re developing ways of getting it to you faster (sometimes out of necessity, not convenience.) So yes, big data will be highly regarded in 10 years, but that’s like saying, “Math will be important 10 years from now.” It’s apparent, but it’s broad. AI may take a huge leap forward and make deep learning a trivial process. But as with any other tech field, you just have to stay on top of new developments. If something replaces deep learning, then learn that new thing. Data science will be around forever, it’s just a question of what form it will take.",3 followers,Sridhar Mahadevan,2.6K,177,6.3M,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-are-upcoming-technologies-in-mobile-phones
3,"I doubt either of them will look much like they do today. I think we're going to see more pipelines, more topology/geometry in algorithm design, and new algorithms that we can't even imagine today. We'll also probably start to see a focus on data quality rather than quantity as other companies begin to use machine learning. It's also possible that we will have quantum computers by then, which will change how we design and implement algorithms.","47,053 followers",Abhinav Sharma,3.5K,865,7.1M,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-are-upcoming-technologies-in-mobile-phones
4,"I would say that no one knows what is going to happen. AI is moving so quickly and where it will be in 2027 is impossible to say. I think within a few years the AI system will be programming themselves and the need for the computer science people will go away. If you look at what AlphaGo did to the game of GO, we are getting into an unknown area. I follow AI reporting daily and the things they are doing and working on, will change everything. At some point we will not understand the answers they give us.","24,166 followers",Dmitriy Genzel,1K,2.6K,26.4M,2017,https://www.quora.com/Thinking-of-Big-Data-or-Machine-Deep-Learning-which-of-these-or-others-could-still-be-regarded-as-high-level-technologies-by-top-companies-in-2027

Germany is not the most technologically advanced country. It could be pretty close, but there are major elements of society who dedicate themselves to making sure that Germany uses inferior technology that kills more people, damages the environment more, costs more money, and will cause the total collapse of Earth’s biosphere due to a runaway greenhouse effect. Mostly in the Green Party. Because radiation from nuclear accidents is apparently scarier than way more people dying of regular pollution constantly and the total annihilation of all life on Earth as the oceans boil away.","5,990 followers",Jens Böttiger,566,2.6K,17.6M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Thinking-of-Big-Data-or-Machine-Deep-Learning-which-of-these-or-others-could-still-be-regarded-as-high-level-technologies-by-top-companies-in-2027
