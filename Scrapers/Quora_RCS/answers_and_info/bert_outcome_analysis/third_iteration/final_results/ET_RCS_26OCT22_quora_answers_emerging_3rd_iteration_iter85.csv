0,"I did a CS degree at Caltech, but became a CS major at the end of my junior year. Senior year, I interviewed at six companies, and got rejected everywhere. It was pretty devastating, especially since I bombed almost every interview, and knew I deserved to get rejected.In retrospect, I think this was because I wasn’t very good at translating algorithms into code. So I would instantly see I needed to use binary search, but it would take me the whole interview to actually write the binary search.Fortunately, I had a lot going for me.I did a CS degree at Caltech, but became a CS major at the end of my junior year.

During the PhD I got decent at interviews, and I’ll be starting at Facebook in April.","129,172 followers",Jessica Su,1.8K,1.5K,49.7M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-top-technology-companies-computer-science-graduates-are-applying-to
1,"Intel has a really neat tool called Pin which allows dynamic binary rewriting.  I started using Pin in my research and eventually got good enough at it that I was answering questions on the message board and then contributing documentation patches.

So become an expert at something your intended company does.",103 followers,Khoa Nguyen,568,105,830.4K,2015,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-top-technology-companies-computer-science-graduates-are-applying-to

Learning other object-oriented languages from C++ foundations is not too difficult.My interests are in cybersecurity, specifically offensive security and ethical hacking. It’s a fairly niche area - most grads want to do machine learning, AI, big data, or whatever big words that are trendy these days. Big tech needs security folks - after all, their brand is more vulnerable to a bad security incident than a small company.Coming from small colleges means there’s no tech career fair, no big names coming to recruit, and job applications from your school get thrown together with similar small colleges for one recruiter to handle, while top schools like MIT, CMU, and Stanford each has their own recruiter from each big tech companies. Those schools might even be able to negotiate job offer deadlines for their students so they don’t get lowballed and have time to get competing offers to hopefully increase their compensation package.It means you have to work extra hard to put yourself and your resume out there to get your first job. Start early - you might not get a big name internship your first or second summer, but your profile is in the company’s database and they’ll remind you to apply next year. I got my first industry internship with Intuit through a conference. After the first internship with a company whose name recruiters recognize, your road to a full-time position will be easier.Best of luck :)",256 followers,Priyal Gupta,9.7K,0,0,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-top-technology-companies-computer-science-graduates-are-applying-to
3,"I’d take one where I could drive a large infra-level transformation of dataflows. Ideally:So, most truly “top” companies are out. Google and Facebook most certainly are. Because they pretty much have already done all this, multiple times.Apple is rumored to be buildingI’d take one where I could drive a large infra-level transformation of dataflows. Ideally:So, most truly “top” companies are out. Google and Facebook most certainly are. Because they pretty much have already done all this, multiple times.Apple is rumored to be building its own search engine, whichNetflix is kind of already too effective, and also it would not offer me the long-term stability I would need to perform: I respect Netflix for being quick to let go of people and teams as necessary, but my contribution would a 5+ years project, and I know I won’t be able to perform at my best knowing that some externalities may result in me not working on it a quarter from now.Facebook is too hacky. Some high-volume sub-project (WhatsApp!) may well be a lot of fun, but most certainly not The Big Facebook.Microsoft: it is no secret that I do admire Microsoft for their work culture, but it’s not likely they would need my skills set. Although I kind of regret not pushing it hard enough a few years back when considering joining the Visual Studio team: the deal-breaker was that I wanted to appeal to open source developers (“I would like to give a talk at Moscone center and present a strong argument for Python or Node developers to actually switch to Visual Studio, because it’s the best IDE for this breed of developers”), while Microsoft largely remains B2B-centric.Amazon: too Java, and I don’t like the culture.Salesforce: well, I was at ServiceNow, which is rumored to be similar inside. Too much Java to my taste, but, if it’s a C++ project with tight scale & performance requirements, why not?SpaceX / Tesla / Neuralink: SpaceX was the only company in the past few years which I actually applied to (spoiler: they haven’t called me back), to Redmond, where the Starlink network stack was presumably designed and implemented. Tesla makes far too many overpromises to my taste, so no. And Neuralink is a bunch of hipsters, at least based on what I heard and based on my anonymous interview with them not too long ago (spoiler: me and the interviewer were totally talking past one another, as she was largely into selling me on the idea how cool it would be to actually get some BPS between the human brain and a computer, while I was, and remain, skeptical about a) how do we measure this BPS, and b) why exactly higher BPS the way they are measuring it would be valuable to my, human, brain).A company of smaller scale would likely have a lower hiring bar, which means harder to do ambitious things. So, I won’t go much smaller.So, in conclusion, if it’s a C++ real-time ML-enabled scalable system, Microsoft may well be a yes, Salesforce may be a yes, ServiceNow may be a yes if only they kept their word when they acquired me , and other candidates for a yes would be second-ish tire companies such as Expedia / Grab / eBay / Twitter / Indeed /Quora / Asana / Parler / Blind, assuming they both have an ambitious enough problem to solve and enough resources + talent for me to seriously take it.Although in my case the above is unlikely to happen. I’m not not much into corporate games and corporate culture. It’s a lot more fun (and a lot more value delivered per hour worked, to my taste) to be a consultant and take mid-to-long-term projects in optimizing various dataflows, from trading and crypto to thousands of nontrivial user actions per second — which is what I mostly am doing for the past several years, and am not really looking back.",256 followers,Priyal Gupta,9.7K,0,0,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-top-technology-companies-computer-science-graduates-are-applying-to

6,"Internship applications for the summer open around early-mid September usually for a lot of companies. You just have to check their websites to see if the application is open or when it will be open. The best time to apply is as soon as you can once the application opens. For Google, they keep extending offers to people until enough people have accepted. On their website it usually says the application closes in January, but they closed it mid December this past year.

8,"I had the fine opportunity to ride up on a ski lift this last winter with a couple of software developers from Google. When I asked them this question, they told me that contributions to open source software is something that makes intern applicants stand out. It shows that you have the abillity to take established code and add something of value to it. Since most of your work at Google would be working with other team members on huge code bases, a portfolio of your contributions (perhaps through Github) would probably be pretty beneficial.",26 followers,Balaji Viswanathan,5.4K,5.6K,426.9M,2016,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-top-technology-companies-computer-science-graduates-are-applying-to
9,"As an Amazon employee that sees a lot of resumes let me tell you why yours will end up in the trash and you will never get a chance to prove yourself to me. The interview process at these large companies is heavily biased toward weeding out potential good candidates on accident, just to make sure we never end up with a bad hire. One red flag alone COULD be looked over by someone reviewing your resume as long as you have a lot of other good points. The second red flag, I stop reading and dump the resume in the trash. My time is too valuable to waste on a bad resume. Let's start from the top:ParAs an Amazon employee that sees a lot of resumes let me tell you why yours will end up in the trash and you will never get a chance to prove yourself to me. The interview process at these large companies is heavily biased toward weeding out potential good candidates on accident, just to make sure we never end up with a bad hire. One red flag alone COULD be looked over by someone reviewing your resume as long as you have a lot of other good points. The second red flag, I stop reading and dump the resume in the trash. My time is too valuable to waste on a bad resume. Let's start from the top:Part-time programmer' - What do you do with the other part of your time? I don't want to work with someone that doesn't even care enough about this industry to do it full time. This is also a red flag that you could be the person that always comes in late and leaves early and always seems to be behind on their work. This is not a good impression to leave.Ok, I am done tearing your resume apart and I apologize if anything I said above hurts your feelings. But, I want you to understand why you won't get a job at Google, Amazon, Facebook, <insert top tier company here> as your resume sits.If you really want to work at one of these companies you should do a couple things. First, change your resume so the major red flags I pointed out above are a little less obvious. If you need help with this, there are lots of online resources for writing quality resumes. Second, you should consider getting a job with a real software company. Doing Freelance work can be rewarding if that is what you want to do for the rest of your life, but you want to work for a big software company so why are you doing it? Go get some relevant job experience to make up for the lack of formal education. This will do wonders for getting your resume out of the trash bin and into the consider pile. As it stands, the only way you will ever get an in-person interview again is to impress another recruiter at a coding competition.I really do wish you the best of luck in getting that dream job you are after. But like most dreams, they don't come for free so work hard and you will get there eventually.","89,623 followers",Aviral Bhatnagar,863,831,35M,2015,https://www.quora.com/If-you-could-get-offers-from-all-top-technology-companies-which-one-would-you-accept-Why
