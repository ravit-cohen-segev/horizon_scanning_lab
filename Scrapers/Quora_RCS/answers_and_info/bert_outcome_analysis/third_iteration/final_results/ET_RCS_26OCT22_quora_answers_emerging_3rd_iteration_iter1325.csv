There are villages where children don't even have pens and pencils; rather they rely on rudimentary writing implements to create stuff. I doubt technology, whether current or new, will be able to get to these people within the next 50 years, just like most other modern tech.","5,084 followers",Bobby Tatro,3.9K,2.2K,45.6M,2013,https://www.quora.com/Will-new-technologies-render-pens-and-pencils-obsolete-in-the-next-fifty-years
1,"Very unlikely. First, only the wealthy Western world routinely has access to digital writing tools, and handwriting is still taught as an important skill in places like India and China. Second, we’re always going to need ways of leaving notes non-electronically. Suppose you’re in a hotel room and you want to leave a note for housekeeping asking for more towels. You don’t know the maid’s electronic ID. The obvious thing is to write it on a slip of paper.","44,299 followers",Kurt Guntheroth,575,13.7K,167.3M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Will-new-technologies-render-pens-and-pencils-obsolete-in-the-next-fifty-years

Actually, those plastic pens used to interact with resistive screens have dull tips. I haven't found a writing tool other than a pencil or a fountain pen that lets me draw with minute precision and greater wrist control. The lowly pencil gives me more surfaces of varied textures to scribble my thoughts. Also, a lead pencil or a pen doesn't rely on electricity to function.","135,504 followers",Hector Quintanilla,582,1.2K,88.5M,2013,https://www.quora.com/Will-new-technologies-render-pens-and-pencils-obsolete-in-the-next-fifty-years

When I heard the doctor tell her “six months”, it felt likeI met my wife, Jess, twenty-one years ago when she was nineteen.Our parents owned side-by-side cabins in the northern part of New York and we both happened to be along for the week-long hunting trip our fathers planned that year.Jess' father was a skilled hunter and could hit a headshot from a mile away — same as my dad.Jess and I didn't hunt with them — we hung out by the lake.The moment I saw Jess I fell in love. We've been together ever since.But now, now that she has an expiration date, I just don't know what to do — I'm scared and lost.Monday morning at work I was telling my best friend and supervisor, Timmy, about my wife's condition. Timmy told me that I.T. or Intelligent Terrestrial just came out with their latest models.These models are different than those of yesteryear because they are 52% mechanical and 48% biological.Timmy said all you have to do is mail a sample of DNA to I.T. and upload a digital copy of your consciousness through an app. You can then purchase a custom made clone at an age of your choice. When the clone arrives it will turn on, study it's surroundings and await a consciousness download.“Oh my God Timmy, what's the catch?”“The price, Leon.”When I got home from work, Jess and I plugged in and uploaded a digital copy of our entire conscious catalog to I.T. and then mailed off DNA samples.Jess asked me what age I wanted her to be. It felt awkward to say “twenty”, but I did it — I was honest. I miss her smooth, youthful skin and I want her to be young and healthy — especially if I have to cash my entire 401K in to afford it.We told her parents that we were going to basically bring her back from the dead and her father threatened to shoot any abomination that we brought into this world.One month later, on a day that Jess was particularly ill, the doorbell rang.Jess and I dragged the box through the door and laid it on the living room floor. I gently cut along the lines and when I opened the flaps, there,she,was.The last time my heart fluttered like this was the day I met her.Jess helped me lift I.T. out of the box and sit I.T. up.I.T. was warm and soft. I.T. was mine. I paid for I.T. I own I.T.Machines like this don't have rights — even though they are part biological, the governments recognize them in the same way they would a lawnmower — so, as I said, I.T. is my possession.The science behind uploading a digital consciousness is so cutting edge, that the laws just haven't caught up yet.Jess turned I.T. on and I.T. looked right into my eyes. I was in love — with two women, but, it was the same woman. We hadn't uploaded Jess' consciousness yet, so, I.T. was running on basic programming, but I.T. was gorgeous.Jess asked me what I wanted to do, and for the first time in a very long time — I lied to her.I told her we should go shopping and buy I.T. some clothes.I.T. doesn't seem to have a personality yet.“Hello…. Smile…”Jess picked outfits for both of them and we went for a walk through the park together. It was amazing — I was so happy.We walked down a cozy little trail and found a tuck away to sit and talk.I.T. watched and studied every move Jess and I made. I.T. was learning and adapting.I.T. was becoming aware.At one point Jess and I got distracted and I.T. wandered off. When we found I.T., I.T. was gazing at the sky.I asked I.T. what it was doing. I.T. said, “Where do I come from?”“You come from Heaven. You are my angel.”That answer seemed to work for I.T. We all walked back to the car and headed home.When we got home, Jess immediately started coughing. She fell to the ground and I tried to help her, but I didn't know what to do.Jess passed away right then. It was finally over.I called her family and the police. It took an hour for them to remove the body. I had Jess 2.0 sitting in my back room waiting for them to leave.After the police left, I plugged I.T. into my laptop and downloaded Jess' consciousness.After the download was complete, we walked outside and I looked into her gigantic brown eyes. I asked her, “Is it you, Jess?”She smiled and said, “It is, silly — now kiss me.”Her head slammed back. I didn't know if she was glitching or what and then I heard a bang and saw a hole above her left eye.My beautiful Jessica died twice today. I was crushed.Over the next two decades, I fell into a deep, dark, alcohol-fueled depression. Although I had developed a serious alcohol problem, I was able to work and save every single penny I earned.After twenty years of saving, I decided I wanted both of them back — the twenty-year-old Jess and the forty-year-old Jess.I sent my entire life savings off to I.T. and in one month, my doorbell rang.I cut the box open and wept when I saw my angel(s).I turned them on.I also clothed them. The younger version of me may have left them in the nude, but at this age, I just want my companion(s) back.The ladies helped me back to my room to lay down. I was so tired from all the excitement.I've waited and worked an entire lifetime to be with the woman I love. And now, at long last — she is beside me.I died, on that very night as a happy man.One day later, the doorbell rang. It seems my beautiful Jessicas used my direct deposit life insurance benefit to make a purchase.They gently cut the box open.And turned me on.You ask where technology will be in 2050?We will be everywhere.LeonSpecial thanks:Cameron — Dear friend. Thank you so much for all your help with bringing this idea to life. You are awesome. I'm proud to call you friend.Kinsalynn — My sister and friend. Your help with makeup and photography was an absolute godsend — thank you so much. I love and appreciate you. P.S. you took over 300 pictures in an eight hour span.

5,"Transfer learning in ML models.Humans are really good at generalizing. We only have to see a few dogs before we can recognize a dog when we see one.Machines are not.

If your training data doesn't include dogs with three legs, the model won't recognize them.

I think this may be sufficient to achieve artificial general intelligence, but even if not, it will dramatically extend the range of tasks that machines can accomplish.","1,808 followers",Alex Rogachevsky,764,595,4.9M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Will-new-technologies-render-pens-and-pencils-obsolete-in-the-next-fifty-years

There are probably less than 1,000 developers that have done the above things and there is currently a lot of demand for blockchain developers.Currently blockchain developers are mostly only needed by people who want to start their own cryptocurrency, which aren’t that many.Once banks, government, large companies will start to adopt blockchain, this need will explode, because blockchain will go into the mainstream.If you want to complete your blockchain knowledge and know everything about blockchain development, you can also do these 2 thingsThen you are probably among the most experienced 200 blockchain developers worldwide and very in demand.ConclusionSo, these are the steps to become a real blockchain developer.

Looking at the other answers, it is also obvious that a lot of non-tech people are mixing blockchain and cryptocurrencies together, thinking they’re one and the same things.Here’s what you need to learn, if you want to do “blockchain” stuff. Start with learning about distributed systems, and get your programming game on. Go through the classic papers like Two Generals Problem, Byzantine Generals Problem, FLP Impossibility Proof, Paxos, and then ask yourself, do you know how to coordinate a network of individual nodes that needs to reach consensus of some sort. Then read the bitcoin whitepaper and learn why is it different from the normal paxos algorithm. That should equip you with enough foundational knowledge to evaluate blockchain technologies, and find ways to implement them in real world scenarios.Make sure you are comfortable with programming, internet protocols, basic cryptographic algorithms, consensus algorithms, and basic distributed computing principles. These can be acquired by getting a computer science degree, and working in tech companies with sufficient data for you to play around with.Good luck!",3 followers,Sridhar Mahadevan,1.1K,177,6.3M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Will-new-technologies-render-pens-and-pencils-obsolete-in-the-next-fifty-years
