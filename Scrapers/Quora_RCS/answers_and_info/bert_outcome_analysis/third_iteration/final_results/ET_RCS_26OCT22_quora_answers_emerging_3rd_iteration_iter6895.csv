Your own self-doubt will sabotage you if you don't control it.Start building, learning and handling the job.

There is a lot of linkages between HK and Silicon Valley, and there are a lot of opportunities to intern or push a startup through an accelerator in SV.  If you start a business in HK, you'll pretty quickly be in a situation where you are interacting with SV venture capital people, and there have been some cases of HK companies being bought out by SV.",30 followers,Robin Thomas,989,731,13.7M,2015,https://www.quora.com/I-am-doing-a-software-development-course-in-an-Irish-institute-of-technology-Will-I-find-it-hard-to-get-work-in-silicon-valley

5,"This is a marshmallow question: immediate returns vs delayed ones. I’ll be honest to you, unless you are a prodigy who dropped out of school to launch a company and succeeded, the absence of a formal degree is very likely to hinder you later in life, because you might be scored lower than all those who persevered and completed their degree. Once you land a job and start getting actual experience, it might matter less, but the first years would be quite hard.Let’s compare!BS degree.This is a marshmallow question: immediate returns vs delayed ones.

6,"DICE has developed an engine were you can destroy a certain amount of things in an open world. It is called frostbite 3. It uses destruction 4.0 to make it look as realistic as possible. But to make everything destructable, you need the highest-end CPU, highest-end GPU and RAM. It is such extremely complex to let all the particles fall in the good direction, with a set amount of speed and impact. And to calculate all that, you need a lot of RAM and processing power, especially if you are destroying multiple objects at a time.Frostbite 3 logoDICE has developed an engine were you can destroy a certain amount of things in an open world.

7,"“Do professional game developers need to memorize a bunch of functions to make a game.”When someone says memorize, to me it means to deliberately commit something to memory.For instance, when I took Chemistry in High School I was required to memorize the periodic table (up to a point.)Doing so required flash cards and tremendous amounts of deliberate practice quizzing myself to make sure I knew it.I have never done anything like that as a programmer and I can't imagine doing so.Sure, I know many Unity API functions by heart, their names, their parameters, and what they return.

10,Until we build spacecraft that are large enough and strong enough to generate “artificial gravity” by rotating at an appropriate rate - we can’t be in space for more than a few months without suffering permanent health degradation.We don’t have a scientific answer to the question “How much gravity do we need?” and “How much coriolis and tidal forces can we comfortably tolerate?” - so embarking on this kind of technology is a bad idea.With technology that we have today - we can’t go much further than the Moon and we probably can’t stay there for very long once we get there.,UNKNOWN,Robert Frost,942,9.4K,195.6M,2021,https://www.quora.com/I-am-doing-a-software-development-course-in-an-Irish-institute-of-technology-Will-I-find-it-hard-to-get-work-in-silicon-valley
