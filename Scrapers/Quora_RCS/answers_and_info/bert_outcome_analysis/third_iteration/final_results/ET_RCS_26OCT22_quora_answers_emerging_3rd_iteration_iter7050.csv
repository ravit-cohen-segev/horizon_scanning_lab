On Android, it took me 567 lines of code and 3 days.Long version: First, let me say that the other answers which talk about how little money there is in Android are at least partially true, but (for me personally) it’s not as dire as they make it out to be. I make a non-trivial amount of money from my Android apps but I make more than double that amount on my iOS apps.But to the main point… Android sucks. I know this sounds like a religious argument, but bear with me.To be clear, as an AndroidApple works diligently to make iOS WORK very well AND look good at the same time. Many of the bits of visual candy that Apple includes in iOS actually help with usability, they aren’tHowever, Google focused primarily on just getting the basics of Android working because they valued the idea of individual expression by the developers as opposed to Apple who wanted apps to have a consistent look and feel. (I used to work at Google, so I understand the inside mentality.) The problem is that the vast majority of developers are not trained in usability or graphical design and so their apps looked crude and worked crudely. Around the time of Android 4.x Google realized they had a real problem because no two Android apps worked in the same fashion because every developer came up with a different approach. They started trying to standardize the UI and they got some of their graphics people to try to make the visual elements look nicer. It still wasn’t great.Here is a specific example of the difference in effort from the developer’s perspective. I have a feature in one of my iOS apps and I wanted to make sure that feature was in the Android version as well.The feature involves tapping+holding on an item in a list/table and then dragging it upward or downward to reorder the items in the table (drag and drop). In iOS, this only took me 23 lines of code because essentially everything is already built-in to the underlying iOS system. The UITableView object (the scrolling lists you see everywhere in iOS) already knows how to respond to tap+hold and already knows how to animate moving the row as you drag around your finger… and already applies a nice drop shadow as you’re dragging the row around… and already knows how to animate the other rows of the table to move out of the way as you drag this one row around, etc. It also already has built-in hooks so that the system can ask my code: Should the user be allowed to drag this row? Can the user drop this row in between x and y? and it’ll tell me The User just dragged and dropped this row at this new location, which allows my code to respond to that event.That’s why my iOS code is only 23 lines long. All I have to do is write code that says which rows are draggable and then to respond to them dropping the row so that I can update the underlying data. I implemented this feature in a few minutes on iOS.But Android does NONE of that which is why my Android code is 567 lines long and it took me 3 days to get it all working. Thankfully, in this ONE particular case, I didn’t have to write all of that code myself because SO many other Android developers had complained about missing this incredibly basic feature. In response, Google had posted some “sample code” that showed how to manually create a rudimentary form of the dragging/dropping. Of course, that code was out of date because it was written for Android 4 and didn’t work for Android 5, 6, or 7 (7.x is the current version as of this writing).And their sample code didn’t involve any features for checking if certain rows in the list/table should be allowed to be dragged. It didn’t include any checking if a row should be allowed to dropped in a certain location. It didn’t include the ability to set a callback so that your code could respond to the reordering. I had to take all of their rudimentary, buggy code and try to improve it so that it did more than the kindergarten version of the feature.That meant I spent multiple days to produce a feature that doesn’t even work as well or look as good as the feature that already exists in iOS and took me only a few minutes. I took a screenshot of the code from both and placed them side-by-side so I could use it to explain the difference. (see below. The screenshot includes the comments in the code, but I didn’t count comments in my line counts.)Whenever I have a client that wants their app on both iOS and Android, I tell them the Android version will take 4 times longer to produce and will only be about 80% as good. When I give them the quote, I determine how much the iOS app will take to produce and then I multiply that number by 2.5 to cover the Android version… which doesn’t -truly- pay for all of my time on the Android version, but charging 4 times the amount sounds ludicrous to them because they don’t know what it’s like.",254 followers,Kenny Wyland,875,0,0,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-most-popular-technologies-used-to-develop-Android-apps

With this in mind, it is essential to highlight the different development platforms that are driving the growth of blockchain technology and its possible mainstream adoption. The leading ones include;EthereumDue to its reliable smart contracting functionality and adaptability, as well as its extensive application in several industry use cases, Ethereum is regarded as one of the most advanced blockchain platforms currently.Irrespective of its extensive adoption in several business use-cases, it is essential to acknowledge that Ethereum is a public network that was created for mass consumption as opposed to being a limited access one. Typically, platforms that support business use-cases have restricted access due to privacy needs.Hyperledger FabricThis platform, which is hosted by the Linux Foundation is an open-source collaborative invention to promote cross-sector blockchain technologies. The core objective of hyperledger fabric is to introduce business-level distributed ledger systems and codebases. Currently, Hyperledger supports more than 85 collaborating business ranging from finance, banking, the Internet of Things, supply chain management, manufacturing, to technology.The primary reason why the hyperledger platform is attractive to blockchain developers is its modular design that permits plug-and-play components around consensus and membership amenities.RippleEstablished in 2012, Ripple aims to link banking institutions, payment service providers, digital asset exchanges, and corporations by facilitating international transactions devoid of chargebacks through RippleNet. Additionally, its cryptocurrency, XRP, is considered one of the most popular virtual token after Bitcoin.This digital currency is regarded as being easily scalable compared to other cryptocurrencies with its 4-second payment settlement duration and the capacity to process 1500 transactions every second. Ripple has over 75 clients focused on developing a cross-border payment, liquidity cost minimization, and cross-network payment solutions.QuorumLaunched in 2015, this platform is designed to deal with applications that need advanced speeds as well as advanced throughput processing of private transactions among a permissioned cohort of participants. Since this platform does not employ the Proof-of-Work consensus algorithm, its combination of a vote-centered system alongside other mechanisms allow it to handle hundreds of transactions every second.Essentially, Quorum is designed to evolve in tandem with Ethereum since it alters Ethereum’s core slightly. Its attractiveness is connected to its open-source nature. Additionally, since it is permissionless, promotes experimentation, and incorporates Ethereum’s improvements seamlessly, most blockchain developers find it an attractive prospect.R3 CordaPioneered in 2013, R3 Corda is an open-source distributed ledger platform that was initially earmarked for use within the banking industry. However, its application is extending to the development of blockchain-based solutions in supply chain management, healthcare, commerce, government sectors.R3 Corda is a permissioned blockchain platform since it limits access to information on its network to an agreement involving those who are clearly entitled to it as opposed to the entire system. Apart from acknowledging the complexity of overseeing financial agreements in its consensus mechanism, this platform is preferred for its emphasis on interoperability and the integration of legacy frameworks.",54 followers,Gordon Clark,2.3K,0,0,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-most-popular-technologies-used-to-develop-Android-apps
