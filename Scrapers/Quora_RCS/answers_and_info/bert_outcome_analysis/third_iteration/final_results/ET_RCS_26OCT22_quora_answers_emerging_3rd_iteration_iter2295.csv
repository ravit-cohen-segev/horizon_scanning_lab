If you see architecture and stuff of older famous civilizations one can just marvel.So,yes our human ancestors were not dumb at all and they were quite smart.Coming specifically to India. Yes, we Indians were good at many things. Including maths,science and medicine. Those things did got transferred.The whole conspiracy theory that burning of nalanda destroyed everything is just an excuse. To realize it one can carefully study era before that happened and after it happened. Even though moghuls were not very fond of Indian culture but they did use better things. They exported the knowledge and then it was used and improved on by varius scientist of world in Islamic Golden age. One can study about how Baghdad became centre of invention and how every knowledge from every place reached there and was documented.One may argue that they usurped out knowledge and then portrayed as theirs but even in that case the knowledge was not lost. You can clearly see how they worked on trignometry etc.It is not dissimilar to like we have a patent and other company works on it to make some other invention.So, if anyone claims that the initial knowledge is only what mattered then that is just wrong plain and simple.What we are today is because of us. Nobody stopped us from using Ayurvedic methods. Nobody forced us to not transfer maths knowledge. Saying that all the maths knowledge was just in Nalanda and rest of India had no clue about it is just utter denial.It gives us perfect excuse. Blame the Mughals they did it. Well if anybody knows about history they would agree that Indian civilizations had trade with civilizations of mesopotamia and others. And all these civilizations has trade. It is but natural that knowledge transfer will also happen. It is not as if we were having nukes and those people were in jungles and we had trade.  Both civilizations were at par. Our may have been little better. That is how human civilizations had been all through history.Saying our civilization had nukes while other humans were inferior is just plain ignorance,self boasting and denial.Yes, we were good. We had been a force in world. We lead in many things. But saying we were kinda aliens and rest were bullshit is what is problematic. If one studies other civilizations it becomes clearer that every famous civilization was good and contributed a lot. Take for example early egyptian one. It was really good.Just before Mughals our history is quite documented. One can read about it and infer that  Mughals were not the ultimate villain in destroying everything we percieve to be destroyed.The longer we remain in this denial mode the longer we will be complacent. Fact is now we are a third world country with extreme poverty where corrupton is rampant. We have our good moments but we have very far to go. If we rank countries now we fare quite behind the world and we have to catch up. Harping about Shastra of Mahabharat will not make us defeat terrorism. Does not matter who brought the knowledge and from where. What matters is what we do with what we have now.Reading more mahabharat will not solve our problems now. Researching on what is available will.So my advice will be to move on.","68,788 followers",Kanthaswamy Balasubramaniam,898,17.3K,413.5M,2016,https://www.quora.com/If-the-Indians-allegedly-had-enormously-advanced-technology-in-olden-times-where-did-it-all-go

At least the Indians ancients did . In this process they have made significant discoveries like gravity ( indirectly mentioned in vedas) , life span of universe and earth which were very close to modern scientific calculations.The concepts of parallel universes and the infiniteness of the universe ; Infact they have also saidWho really knows, and who can swear,This seemed to be the beginning of their quest for seeking the truth . Accepting that you do not know is the starting point of any discovery .After deeply analyzing the Universe not just by the normal human senses but by becoming a higher-self through practice of meditation (dhyana or awakening the hidden consciousness) .  They have come up with these ancient vedic  hymns and chants which can help human race in kali yuga .Therefore Vedanta (the last bit of knowledge/  veda- knowledge , anta-end)AsOur Ancients gift to the humanity is spirituality which should embraced to attain peace .Thus to know everything one shud look inwards rather than outwards .

The seal is 1.3″ (34mm) in size, tiny, with extraordinary fine detail, wax will not faithfully reproduce its fidelity. It has milling holes of 0.06mm and tool placement tolerances of 0.01mm, see hairline. Dividing calliper scoring arcs are shown under high magnification which were not polished out. The calliper is accredited to Talos/Perdix, Daedalus’ nephew, the significance of this is it dramatically improves engineering tolerances. It is often the unseen tools to make these artefacts that are more impressive than the artefact themselves, a calliper is hugely important for standardisation, engineering and geometry. A seal of this precision would not be seen again until some time after the age of enlightenment. Its detail is comparable with early banknote plates (around the C18th CE). The section below is approximately 10mm in view size.No, these optical lenses…Similar dating, Mount Ida, Crete, ca 1400 BCE, however, this may be when the lenses were stored in the Caves of Minos. Made from precision ground rock-crystal (natural glass), see what I mean, with a dividing compass (callipers) one can create an arc to create a lens and critically measure the arc to improve; in this case: optics.Hang on a minute, maybe these white-hulled ships…Santorini (Thera) before the eruption of 1628 BCE. The reconstruction team thought they used flax linen cloth in pine resin (a natural thermoplastic) with limestone powder to make the hull white (a composite matrix) over a wooden frame. The reinforcement is shown inside and out, if the hull is compromised on rocks, it will delaminate, keeping the hull watertight to make landfall and repair, saving the crew, ship and cargo. Glass fibre composites were invented in 1950’s COMMON ERA. Flax is almost as strong in tension.No this…Later bronze casting currently in the Met Museum, NY, ca 700 BCE from originally Samos, Greece. It's the closest thing I’ve seen to what Daedalus’ glider may have been. An airframe! If the fabled account of Icarus is correct: the remains of his glider were found at IcariaWe have little idea of what technology the Minoan’s really had, most of it has decayed and is lost to time. The Athenians kept the white hull ship Theseus returned in, it was on display for centuries as a trophy of Athens increasing power. According to myth, Theseus tried to secure magnetite and got thrown off a cliff on Skyros, a source of Magnetite! Athens didn’t know how to make another white-hull, they fell out of use, it is sufficiently advanced that they were unable to reproduce it.A communication network across the Aegean? Well, they had one according to Homer, the fall of Troy was reported to Argos in a few hours using island fire beacons (Peak Sanctuaries which have line-of-sight between them and are present throughout the entire Aegean), e.g. a message relayed at a few hundred miles per hour using long-distance signals, fires at night, gravity cast flat mirrors called Labyrs (double-axe) in the day.Peak sanctuary above. Note all the measuring devices!Kit checkBlind embossing printing: Check. Money (Palace gold tokens): Check. Sewers, flushing toilets, interlocking clay pipes with injectors to remove debris, aqueducts, tunnels straight through mountains, hot and cold running water to upper stores. Check, check, check, check, check and check. Are you getting dizzy? All of these things are technically demonstrated in the mid second millennium before common era and were (largely) lost in Bronze Age collapse to be rediscovered often centuries and in some rare cases many millennia later.The fingers. The (Idaean) Dactyls:What is shown above is miltech from the Bronze Age and it makes advanced research agencies of today look like they are playing at it! We should have been on the moon at the beginning of the common era on this trajectory. An enlightenment had already happened before the common era, then an island erupted (1628 BCE), then the Mycenaeans invaded (1450 BCE), then Bronze Age Collapse (1225 BCE): the world had gone very badly wrong and took a different course…What can we not understand about Minoans?And if its prehistory, this…Oldest obsidian bracelet reveals amazing craftsmen's skills in the eighth millennium BCA short time after this, this…“Bird-man”. A count of the days of the year is shown in the background and confirm on the count shown on the entwined snakes!Make no mistake this artifact is MORE significant than the Antikythera mechanism. This culture had no writing system but are clearly numerate and can record information using a visual language. Speculative on my part, but the four suns may be recording an Olympiad to add a leap month to keep the lunar and solar calendar aligned and the nine suns (years) anA shared cultural heritage; the fingers (Dactyls), the makers.Measure human, measure! The boss, is the thumb: Herakles (position), and likely the artist is referred to this on the first seal, the only people that would realize this are those with a lens inspecting the seal!This is all hidden in plain sight. The Dactyls are the Quartermasters to those perceived as Gods. They made the tools, machines, weapons and systems. One hand is male, the other female. They built the most extraordinary things: transformative technology and systems.Administration may be the glue of civilization, but it is the technology that increases efficiency and with that increased output. Without technology, we would never be able to support such truly huge populations of today and we would otherwise still be living in the stone age, all 7 million of us; three orders of magnitude difference to the actual population of today: 7 billion and counting.These technologies (particularly the old ones) are critical enablers: calendars, machines and platforms to facilitate increased trade in surpluses giving prosperity.

It belies the idea of stupid, grunting cavemen.I like to woodwork. I study historical methods dating back to Roman times.An average craftsman used to make many of his own tools- even up to 100 years ago. This includes precision tools like squares and straightedges.Take a capable modern carpenter and give him a simple chisel and a handsaw. Ask him to make you a square as accurate as what you can buy in the store, and a 4’ straightedge accurate to say, 0.004” across its length.I doubt many would be up to the challenge.Yet a Roman carpenter would have built a hand plane (using the chisel as an iron) and a pair of dividers, then he would have gotten to work on the square and straightedge using simple geometry.I imagine if you went back in time 1,000 years, you’d be just as incompetent as someone from 1,000 years ago in present day.

It was the Wheelwright.Making a wheel from wood with an axle that attaches to a cart and doesn’t fall apart within a mile or two is one of the most “advanced technologies” of all time. Without it, most civilizations would have failed or failed to spread. Cart wheels are complex and the forces must play against each other continuously to hold the wheel together as it rolls. A Cartwright made as much then as a jet airline pilot back does today. In the 1880s when the average wage was $1.50 a day, the Wheelwright was making 90 dollars a week. On the Mayflower they brought one single cart over to America and it was the most valuable thing on the ship manifest, worth more than 10 times the next most valuable thing on the ship. Can you make a cartwheel? It’s an “advanced technology” that very, very few people can make today, even with machine tools.What is an “advanced technology”?",18 followers,Asim Qureshi,12.7K,996,156M,2020,https://www.quora.com/If-the-Indians-allegedly-had-enormously-advanced-technology-in-olden-times-where-did-it-all-go

So, how come there aren’t loads of mentions of the people who would have been set to work to mine resources, operate fuel refineries, work at the landing site in order to service the interstellar spacecraft that presumably would have landed? Heck, even a regular car needs a network of gas stations and mechanics to keep them going.By comparison, in 2000 years if future archeologists uncover the equivalent of a city buried like pompei, they are going to marvel at all these weird glass and metal oblongs that we seemed to deify, but when they prize them open, they will likely deduce that the metal pathways and corroded acid and metal cuboids were some kind of (to them) primitive electrical device, and when they look at the screen under a microscope they will hypothesise that it could be made to light up when electricty flowed through it - this will be backed up by old historical documents mentioning “Verizon” or “Vodafone” and bills showing how people paid to use the network of radio antennas scattered over the land. The point is, there will be lots of evidence showing our dependence on electronics and wireless technology, not just one out of context, badly translated piece of text that a fringe “researcher” seizes on to back up his “theory”.","43,420 followers",Misha Firer,5.1K,1.3K,133.7M,2020,https://www.quora.com/If-the-Indians-allegedly-had-enormously-advanced-technology-in-olden-times-where-did-it-all-go
19,"Homo sapiens have existed for about 250,000 years. In our civilization, it took about 10,000 years after the last ice age to go from hunter-gatherers to space-farers with nuclear reactors.Let’s assume those first humans followed a similar path, and 240,000 years ago, their technology rivaled ours. There would be no trace of their civilization in terms of buildings - those would have all eroded away. And no artifacts - those would be buried so deep they’ve probably all been destroyed by lava and earthquakes, and the ones that haven’t we’ll never dig deep enough to find.That leaves two things weHomo sapiens have existed for about 250,000 years.

Satellites placed in geosynchronous orbit won’t decay and fall back to Earth for millions of years. We have hundreds in that orbit because of its usefulness in keeping coverage over the same area all the time.But we haven’t found a single satellite we can’t account for, with numerous sky surveys - I remember reading recently about them tracking a meteor less than a meter wide on its way to hit Earth’s atmosphere. It was a new system, so who knows: maybe objects as small as a satellite have escaped our sensors until now.But I highly doubt it, given that we routinely do radar sweeps designed to encompass the entire solar system, as well as infrared, x-ray, ultraviolet, and of course visible light observations of the sky. I think if an ancient civilization was space-faring, we’d have found their satellites, or a derelict ship, by now.So that just leaves refined nuclear material: Uranium-238 has a half-life of 4.46 billion years. Uranium-235 has a half-life of 700 million years. Meaning almost none of it has decayed by now, and we’d probably detect it doing surveys to try to find natural uranium deposits. Thorium-232, the best candidate for next-generation nuclear reactors, has a half-life of 14 billion years - longer than the current age of the universe!It would be fascinating if we ever found these remnants of an early human civilization. But the longer we don’t, the less likely it becomes that we ever will. If we did, there would probably be a lot of debate about whether it was an early human civilization, or an alien visitation; since there wouldn’t be anything else discovered along with it to provide context.",219 followers,Krishnan Raghavan,1.1K,131,630.8K,2020,https://www.quora.com/If-the-Indians-allegedly-had-enormously-advanced-technology-in-olden-times-where-did-it-all-go
20,"No.That is not how technology works.Technology is not just instruments, it is also the wealth of knowledge used to build it, and that wealth inevitably stands on the shoulders of smaller amounts of wealth, times when civilization was less advanced.

21,"Some ancient civilizations did have technology that is more advanced then what we have today in some areas that has been lost over time or passed over due to newer technologies.

These are all things that we guess at but can’t be sure of how it was really done. These and many other technologies are lost, some because the need for the technology was no longer needed or newer ways were found to do them and the knowledge was lost and now we wonder how they did it. I once helped a friend move a 10 by 20 ft shed from one lot to a neighbors lot, a mover had bid a couple thousand to do the job and by friend offered to do it for a large pizza and a six pack. We jacked up the shed and placed it on a frame of 4x4s and set it down on a pivot and he swung it around to the next pivot and swung it again to the next pivot and repeated until the shed was in its new place. I moved the pivots where he wanted them. Took an hour or so of not very hard work using almost forgotten technology. The ancients had a lot of tricks like that manlky of which are now lost in time due to new technologies coming along.","29,945 followers",Tomaž Vargazon,758,7.7K,249.8M,2021,https://www.quora.com/If-the-Indians-allegedly-had-enormously-advanced-technology-in-olden-times-where-did-it-all-go
