With ASIC you can’t do that as they mostly develop ASICs for widely used algorithmsWhat about those coins starting to use new algorithms which can boom 10 or 100x?You can’t really mine them with ASICs because there isn’t one for them.. and by the time there is it would be sort of too late.","3,398 followers",Raymond Scottman,1.1K,0,0,2018,https://www.quora.com/Why-are-cryptocurrency-miners-still-using-graphics-cards-instead-of-ASICs
1,"There’s no benefit here. Writing as a US taxpayer, every transaction is considered an asset sale of the crypto being spent. Far better is to sell a chunk of crypto for USD and spend the USD on expenses per usual.",0 followers,Daniel Suciu,2.7K,162,634K,2021,https://www.quora.com/Why-are-cryptocurrency-miners-still-using-graphics-cards-instead-of-ASICs
2,"That is a good question. More and more people are unable to afford housing. Affordable housing should be a right. Realtors and real-estate investors are driving the prices of housing up because of pure greed. So many people become realtors to get rich off the unfortunate, people who have had their homes foreclosed on, affordable housing that is changing hands, etc. They have no concience. They want no regulations on rent or property values. It is hard to pass rent-control measures, because the real estate industry has so much money to fight local rent control activists.

If you try to implement rent control, you are called a “commie” or socialist. (As if that’s a bad thing). I have been through this myself. In Napa City CA., we fought for rent control, and the real estate industry spent millions of dollars to fight our initiative. We were only seven citizens who grew up in Napa, and were trying to stop the wealthy from forcing out the less fortunate. Now, no one but the rich can live there. Greed tells people to get as much as you possibly can for a rental, rather than rent at a reasonable price that the average person can afford. I don’t know what has to happen to stop this, but something needs to be done or only the rich will have a roof over their heads.","37,598 followers",Scott Welch,20K,18.9K,62.2M,2017,https://www.quora.com/How-can-I-pay-my-rent-with-cryptocurrency
3,"it's two way, but most likely no.Let's look at the first case.Many people are indoors including me and all they have to feed on is their savings. And in most cases people invest in crypto with only their excess money, or money they can afford to loose. So in such periods of uncertainty, people will have to sell part of their portfolios to survive because human beings always want to be with some cash money so crypto will remain stagnant in price or it will go down.Case twoCrypto is one of those few businesses which people can do from home, so if this situation of quarantine continues for more dit's two way, but most likely no.Let's look at the first case.Many people are indoors including me and all they have to feed on is their savings.

This is obvious because airports have to be shut-down and international trade takes a big hit, people start getting sick and stop working, companies get shut down, people stay home from work to not get infected.With international tensions already going strong, a pandemic could also trigger a years long recession.This is a possible scenario of the Coronavirus outbreak and the current numbers.It is similar to the swine flu break out. However, the swine flu simply peaked after 3 months and then disappeared directly throughout the following month.Source:Overall, after infecting 61 million Americans (18%), 256,000 hospitalizations (0.07% overall and 0.4% of infected) and 12,000 fatalities (0.0035% overall and 0.02% of infected). However, worldwide 575,000 people died of the swine flu.Source:If a pandemic really breaks out, Bitcoin could quickly see $20,000. However, Let’s hope not but instead expect we get our $20k without the need for extrinsic factors, but intrinsic factors such as adoption, hype and the Halving.Things like this will keep happening and every time it amplifies Bitcoin’s already very strong factors for a good run for 2020.","3,398 followers",Raymond Scottman,1.1K,0,0,2020,https://www.quora.com/Will-the-coronavirus-make-cryptocurrency-go-up

It’s the opposite if you want to also make money on the way down.If I were you, I would delete the idea of predicting and make a rule that you will only trade what the market has done, Not what you think the market will do.

And we're talking some real cash here, not a couple of thousands of dollars.Then ordinary people, who are interested in crypto, see that the market price is rising and they rush to invest in fear of missing out. And that's where they, unfortunately, fall into a trap!Because this small community of market manipulators is now ready to SELL their crypto and make a decent profit, and the ordinary folks just bought crypto at a high price! All the manipulators were doing is waiting for enough people to jump on this bandwagon to increase the price and then sell.NOT AN INVESTMENT ADVICEWhat the masses should be doing, if they want to make money by trading crypto,And then when the price is high enough in green, that's when you sell.The price of BTC was around $8k before the stock markets went down. And when they did, the price of BTC went down together with the stock markets. As much as I am a crypto proponent, we must admit that there is no decoupling of cryptocurrency from the traditional markets. It follows the general trend.What I'm getting at here, is that if crypto were independent of traditional markets and would set their own rules for the game, then we wouldn't see the prices drop when the conventional markets went down.Now S&P 500, Dow Jones, NASDAQ, and other big stocks are going up, and BTC with the rest of the crypto is following it. Those traditional stocks are going up because of the governments' consistent stimuli with printed money, but BTC's and the crypto price are following the lead, and on top of that, big whales are speculating on the price. Meaning, pouring more money for the price to go up.Unfortunately, a lot of these crypto market manipulators come from very well-known blockchain projects that we believe in. Meaning, people who create their blockchain with a cryptocurrency are in it mostly to speculate on the price and make a profit in the form of fiat money.I hope this helps.","43,454 followers",Misha Firer,22.4K,1.3K,133.8M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Will-the-coronavirus-make-cryptocurrency-go-up
