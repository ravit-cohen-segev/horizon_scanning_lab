However, there are unique challenges associated with it because digital health is something the industry has never seen before.The medical field's main challenges due toInformation storing and service integration are one the main challenges of digital health. Traditionally, hospitals use relational databases to store and access patient information. However, relational databases cannot efficiently manage unstructured data, such as clinical notes and transcripts. Most organizations successfully implementing non-relational information technology are large and financially capable.The other challenge related to the digital mode of payment is creating problems during the insurance reimbursement for some patients. Because many insurers pay for services rendered, patient advocates believe traditional models incentivize care providers to deliver quantity rather than quality. Additionally, since hospitals get disbursements directly, they have little reason to work collaboratively with others. This typically ends in increased expenses and unsatisfactory patient experiences.Digital health is a new experience for both healthcare providers and patients, so we must accept its errors to an extent. Because innovations promise to change healthcare service delivery forever, it will take some time before the advancements attain their full potential.",0 followers,Lucas Martin,6.4K,65,4.2M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-top-five-impossible-things-in-technology

Because the Covid-19 epidemic has had such a significant influence on healthcare digitization, more healthcare providers are anticipated to use these technologies in the future years.Big data in healthcareIn healthcare, big data refers to the vast amounts of data generated by current technology that collect patient medical records and are utilized to manage hospital performance. It has a wide range of applications, from treating individual patients to forecasting and averting outbreaks and lowering costs.This healthcare technology trend is revolutionizing the industry as we know it. Devices that monitor patients' well-being and assist medical specialists in providing high-quality treatment will be used by the largest medical systems in the future.Internet of Medical ThingsThe Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) is a network of healthcare systems and services intended at delivering effective treatment to rural and remote populations, as well as patients who are unable to visit their doctor. Patients may obtain convenient and high-quality therapy in the comfort of their own homes because to innovation and data integration. Patients can monitor their health data and submit it to their attending physicians using personal health monitoring technology provided by their hospital.Digital TherapeuticsDigital Therapeutics is a patient-centered healthcare movement that uses software to give evidence-based therapy. It can be used as a full replacement or as a supplement to current illness therapy (source). Clinical evaluation, patient-reported outcomes, and clinician monitoring dashboards are all included in this healthcare technology that is designed for both physicians and patients.Remote Patient MonitoringRemote patient monitoring is a trend in healthcare IT that keeps patients and their caregivers in constant contact to coordinate treatment and manage complicated conditions. Clinicians provide their patients with home sets, which include a variety of wearable measurement gadgets, to ensure continuous patient monitoring. These home sets collect vital health information, remind patients to take their medications, and provide pertinent information to healthcare providers.Virtual Reality as the Newest Healthcare TechnologyVirtual reality is revolutionizing the healthcare business by reducing patient recovery times and enhancing hospital administration. Virtual reality headsets are utilized in a variety of ways:Medical interns can utilize virtual reality headsets to improve their skills and knowledge. Medical schools no longer need to rely on cadavers to teach their students about human anatomy; instead, virtual reality allows them to practice in an entirely new setting.In the planning of complex surgeries, virtual reality is quite valuable. For example, surgery teams can use VR equipment to practice their intended intervention in the event of any neurosurgery operations.People with ASD can practice their social and coping abilities in virtual worlds with this cutting-edge health technology.All of these new healthcare technologies are quickly gaining popularity and will eventually take over the market. Companies, of course, want software developers and engineers who will bring the future into the present by implementing these critical healthcare solutions.","5,360 followers",Valerio Cietto,677,2.4K,9.1M,2022,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-top-five-impossible-things-in-technology

There are more mobile internet users than laptop/desktops internet users. If it’s coupled with a good internet connectivity and speed (which is still a challenge), the impact can be far reaching.Cloud TechnologyCloud technology has evolved considerably in the last decade, addressing the concerns like security and accessibility. The ecosystem has also evolved to favor its growth, the demand for mobility, the rise of mobile apps and the reduction in the cost of ownership. The low cost factor that cloud brings with itself is more relevant here. It can, in fact it has, bring low cost IT services to business, read SMEs, which were hitherto available due to the high cost of setting that up in-house.Digital PaymentsWhen I’m writing this, a lot is already happening on this front. Government of India has launched a high decibel Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojna (Prime Minister’s Initiative to Financial Inclusion) to bring a huge number of people who still use cash for business transactions to bank. More than 50 million bank accounts have been opened in less than 6 months. Mobile money can play a big role here. For millions of rural Indians, accessibility of their account through a mobile phone in a secured way can be a big enabler.Internet of Things (IoT)Already a buzzword globally. In 2013, nine billion “things” were estimated to be connected around the world. The number is expected to touch 50 billion by 2025. There are more than 1 billion Google Maps users worldwide. IoT is expected to touch all facets of our life. It is expected to control the flow of goods and services too. India could have somewhere between 2 billion to 10 billion IoT devices connected by 2025 as per the report.Automation of Knowledge WorkFor better decision making. It can catapult Indian SMEs into the next orbit. I can vouch for it. I’ve seen how our communication skills enhancement program has helped thousands of new joinees become job ready in no time, How tools based on artificial intelligence and adaptive learning can impact the upliftment of the society. Couple it with mobile as a medium of dissemination and see the impact.These technology trends are expected to have a bigger socio-economic impact on India. Mckinsey predicts an impact of 1 trillion by 2025. Even if less than 50% of this is achieved, that’s a sizable number to put bets on.

This is the price of veg meal)I was shocked!!!! How can a veg meal cost this much? Then I said get me the bill then I'll pay you.Then that guy got me a raw bill, nothing is written on that only train number and amount, even catering name was not mentioned. Unfortunately I have lost the bill. Otherwise I would have posted here.Then I paid the money. Without saying anything.After that I thought to check on IRCTC site about the actual cost of the meal.Then I got thisLet me zoom it.This is the veg meal cost . These are the items you are supposed to get in a veg meal.Let's have a look at the price.That’s 50 rupees. I'm not even considering food quality, quantity, and the food they had given.How can they take more than double price of each meal?Just suppose in one coach 60 passengers ordered a meal. They are earning70(the extra cost) * 60=4200 rupees4200 rupees they are earning illegally from each coach .Then I told to that pantry boy “you shouldn't charge more than double cost”. Immediately that pantry boy started arguing with me that sir please have a look at our food quality.I just asked one question,Pantry boy had no answer.I asked him to get out.Then I thought to complain in the railways about the exorbitant price in this pantry.You might not have observed there is a toll free number for complaining about pantry service.This is the number :I just called on this number and put a complaint about this.I would never have thought that they would take some action because this is India. When they took action about it.I realized India is changing.After putting a complaint, within 2 minutes that pantry boy came with a sad face and said, “Sir, have you complained?” in a low voice.I said, “Yes I have complained. So what?”His face became red with fear. Then he started convincing me to take back that complaint.Pantry boy :Pantry boyMePantry boy :Then he returned 350 rupees of 5 passengers extra money who were sitting arround me.This is India’s biggest day light scam.I appreciated that government is changing but corruption can't leave India’s hand.Whenever you are facing this type of problem while travelling please put a complaint on that.NOTE: This answer I had written on 2018. the above information was valid till that time, now the price of IRCTC has changed. The standard veg meal price has change to Rs.80 by IRCTC. please do consider while ordering and putting complaint.I know with one complaint our nation is not going to change.But every single drop of water helps to make a ocean.Thank you for reading……",269 followers,Karthik Reddy L,16K,0,0,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-top-five-impossible-things-in-technology
