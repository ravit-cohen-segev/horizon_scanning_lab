0,"Elon Musk has a long history of hyperbole. He routinely uses sales-speak and and exaggeration to describe his companies’ products, plans, or even his own thoughts. You might recall that they came up with “Ludicrous” mode as an option for the Model S back in 2015. This $10,000 option allowed acceleration to 60 mph in 2.8 seconds. This might sound impressive but in reality Ludicrous mode only gave the car 10% better acceleration. They did this by increasing the battery pack output from 1300 to 1500 amps. A slight increase in power output and acceleration does not match Musk’s overblown sales pitElon Musk has a long history of hyperbole.

A slight increase in power output and acceleration does not match Musk’s overblown sales pitch. In other words, the only thing ludicrous was Musk’s description. You might recall that Steve Jobs talked the same way and a lot of people bought Apple products. Apparently many people are susceptible to this.Tesla now has a problem because they don’t have plans to refresh either the model S or X. Musk’s solution to try to maintain excitement is another acceleration boost. This will apparently cost a lot more than $10,000. And, having run out of hyperbole words, Musk is just calling this the “Plaid” powertrain. This has already been tested. According to Tesla:We lapped Laguna Seca in 1:36.555 during advanced R&D testing of our Model S Plaid powertrain and chassis prototypeThe Lucana Seca raceway is 2.238 miles, so we can calculate the average speed as 83.4 mph. That’s impressive for a production car. Maybe they can shave another second or two off the 0–60 mark. Anyway, the reference to alien technology just seems to be Musk, groping for some sales-speak that will top the exaggerations he’s said in the past. At this rate, the next upgrade will be referred to as hyper-dimensional.So, leaving Musk’s vocabulary impairment aside, let’s look at this in terms of real life. Car companies typically produce some high performance, pro-sport models for those who want them. If Tesla’s plaid powertrain can match or beat pro-sport offerings from Ford, Chrysler, and GM at a lower price, it could be quite disruptive.",152 followers,Tom Alexander,11.5K,160,3.5M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Speaking-about-Tesla-s-next-level-powertrain-Elon-Musk-mentioned-it-s-going-to-be-like-alien-technology-What-do-you-think-about-this

2,"High power densities longer range combined with solar power charging. Solar paint and solar glassThis paint may pick up where solar panels leave offSo, imagine a ‘perfect’ battery combined with a ‘perfect’ solar glass, that covers the windsheild and clear coats your car converting every unused photon into power and holding on to it.So, that the car looks and drives like a normal car, but it is sucking up every ounce of light energy that falls on it, and stores ALL OF IT PERFECTLY AND INDEFINITELY.So, say the caHigh power densities longer range combined with solar power charging.

Say there is 4.75 hours of sunlight per day. So that’s 19 kWh per day Now a 100 kWh battery has a 310 mile range. The average motorist drives 16,550 miles per year. 5,338.7 kWh/year. 14.6 kWh/day.What is this worth?16,550 miles per year 24.7 miles per gallon and $3.30 per gallon.$3.30*16550/24.7 =$2211.13Life span of a new car is 8 years or 150,000 miles. This is $17,690 value. So, if all these features add up to less than that, this is a real win for Tesla.This also breaks the potential logjam for high priced lithium in short supply. Replacing it with advanced carbon nanotube or advanced glass technology made of more common stuff.Say we had a 375 kg battery pack that had 265 Wh/kg replaced with a 100 kg battery pack that had 2650 Wh/kg!! With a whopping 265 kWh!! The car could go 821.5 miles on a single charge! That’s 18 days of heavy driving! Most importantly you need never charge the car!!Now what would this mean for Tesla?How Battery Costs Impact Tesla’s Margins: An Interactive AnalysisWell,So, if Tesla has new battery tech - charger at home has battery that trickle charges from house and blasts the power into the mobile battery - standard - and has solar charging features, AS $8,000 option, the would produce DRAMATIC PROFITS.Tesla Inc.$40 billion in sales (double 2018 sales) - and add double their gross income and earning positive net margin increasing market cap to $350 billion from $68 billion.High power density and seamless charging - well that would make home power units unworldly haha - making Solar City very profitable. Imagine a transparent shrink wrap that goes over your roof and a power cord is bonded to either edge feeding into a power box containing a 265 kWh battery that contains enough power to run your house for 6 months! Sheez… What would that be worth?With a 20 year life span, $26,800 - selling that to home owners as a retrofit - basically a shrink wrap that has a power cord pulled around the spouting and feeding a battery pack that fits in the fuse box or under it. Installed for $5,000 - this is another application of this core technology.How about airplanes?A Cessna 172 has 16.2 m2 wing area and 157 kW power plant - 118 kW cruise. 118 kg (43 gallons AV fuel) 312.7 kWh. 2.65 hours. (about half the 5.11 hours duration)With a 50% efficient solar panel on a sunny day the wing could pick up 8.1 kW of power. So, 20 hours in sunlight permits 2.65 hours of flight. Sunlight during the flight adds 11 minutes to the flight time. Of course just as you can add an auxiliary tank to the Skyhawk, it would be a cinch to put on ‘tip batteries’",196 followers,Chang Liu,3.1K,7.1K,23.3M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Speaking-about-Tesla-s-next-level-powertrain-Elon-Musk-mentioned-it-s-going-to-be-like-alien-technology-What-do-you-think-about-this

I’m sure he welcomes your mocking, and so does Tesla.In the span of 10 years, Tesla has achieved more than all other car companies combined.

They recognized that with Li-ion batteries, the time for electric cars had come. This was the most important breakthrough.They had a concept, but there were problems, so they hired the PayPal guy as an Angel investor. That guy was Elon Musk. Immediately, Musk realized that while these guys had a great concept, there were major problems.And this is the moment, in 2004, that Musk bought into the founders’ main idea: that it was time for the human race to look at moving beyond oil. Eberhard had spent some time in the late 1990s living in Saudi Arabia, and he saw first hand what an oil based economy did to the environment, the social equity, the economy, the political order, and the military situation in an area that depended on scarce resources.So what did Musk revolutionize?Elon Musk took the seed idea of Tesla, and made it a viable company.What essentially happened was that Elon Musk succeeded where all other attempts at making electric cars failed. He was able to use the seed idea, improve upon it greatly, assemble a team that continued that improvement, marketed it in his own, unique, semi-charming Sheldon Cooper-ish way, leverage massive investment, cobble together a massive corporation from it, and succeed.The fact that the products for the most part deliver on the core promises that he has made (with the notable exception of Full Self Driving).The 2012 Model S was a stunner:It was directly aimed at cars like the 2012 Audi A7And Audi’s 7 series has crashed ever since:What Musk has done that is so great is that he has normalized electric cars.It will take awhile, and there are a lot of people who either have specific needs, like remote weekenders, heavy hauling (or at least theAnd while some people may be skeptical, the market has spoken:Ford says it will go all-electric in Europe by 2030The end of the fossil fuel car is on the EU agendaBan on new petrol and diesel cars in UK from 2030 under PM's green planBiden plans to replace government fleet with electric vehicleshttps://industryeurope.com/sectors/transportation/volkswagen-to-go-all-electric-by-2026/https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2021/01/28/general-motors-electric/Jaguar to transition to all electric vehicles, Land Rover to go majority electricStackPathThis moment, ladies and gentlemen, was the moment.In 2012, Elon Musk stood in front of a ridiculously good-looking brand new Model S, and signed the death warrant for gasoline and diesel engines.He is not the executioner.

I've witnessed Elon do the impossible not just once or twice, but many times--things I'm certain not another living man could do, and that's if they had the balls to even try.Expect human flaws, expect bumpy and uncertain periods, expect stock prices to rise and fall, expect negative press and critics, expect competition, expect the unexpected, because that's where we're at. But don't for a second think that because you disagree with some of Musk's personal choices, or you're uneasy about your Tesla investment, or you’re scared due to the press you read, that there's a single person on this planet as adept as Musk to run Tesla--if for no other reason than Elon is used to hearing people tell him he'll fail and then ultimately proving them wrong.",18 followers,Asim Qureshi,900,996,156M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Speaking-about-Tesla-s-next-level-powertrain-Elon-Musk-mentioned-it-s-going-to-be-like-alien-technology-What-do-you-think-about-this

Call it a cult, a very nice, warm and fuzzy cult.One VC has publicly stated that if Elon ever needed money for anything, all he had to do was name a number and a check would be waiting, no questions asked.Furthermore, 95% (number pulled from ass, but with high confidence) of them believe, beyond any doubt, that Global Warming (GW) is very real and Tesla and Elon are seen as the “tip of the spear” in the fight against GW.Given Tesla is an automobile manufacturer, it has come an amazingly long way in a short period of time, largely due to Elon and his team. The Valley is proud of both, very proud.I seriously doubt they will allow Tesla to fail, just due to cash flow, because Tesla is their baby too.Additionally, Elon also owns 66% of a cash machine called SpaceX. SpaceX has a very real need to park its money in bonds. In the past, SpaceX bought Solar City bonds. I believe when Tesla acquired Solar City, the bonds were paid off. (I am not 100% on that, so you might want to check.) Consequently, given Elon has full control of SpaceX, Tesla can always sell them some bonds.Then, there is a hardy core of cultish stockholders, like me, who keep buying every new issue of stock, because we have the long view and work hard at understanding the company.Granted, the cash burn is more of a bonfire. But, the money is not being pissed away, good money after bad, but quite the opposite. It is being invested in the new manufacturing process ( machine that makes the machine), other infrastructure, strategic acquisitions and the very best people.Making cars is hard. Elon has affirmed that its a tougher nut than rocket science. In addition, Tesla is doing it different than any prior, breaking new ground daily, in some big and innumerably small ways. Innovation rarely proceeds in a straight line and can be plagued by fits and starts. With complex assembly lines, bottlenecks can be vexing and as soon as you clear one, others pop up. But eventually, they will all be properly adjusted and the thing will hum.In addition, of those that own the car, 97% still say they will have no other and remain loyal, those in line for the Model Three still seem unfazed by the additional wait and engineers from around the world still long to work there. Moreover, they still don't advertise much at all, if any.One more thing, realize that it is the most shorted stock and those that are doing so love to spread bad news, no matter how trivial. Then there are people who just want to see Elon and Tesla fail. So there is no shortage of doom and gloom from that quarter. Thus consider the source when you hear something.

If you think about that short clip for more than a few seconds, you’ll start to imagine what a game changer this is. You may notice immediately that every electronic device other than his headset is now totally irrelevant, but that's only the beginning.For the last 40 years, video game designers, fiction writers, and digital animators have gotten incredibly comfortable making fantasy worlds come alive inside computers. We now live in a world full of professionally creative people that push the limits of human imagination with entertainment media. There is a mature industry creating alternate universes all the time. Companies like Pixar, Valve, Blizzard, IL&M, and thousands of others have designed environments that push our conceptions to the limit, free from the constrains of physical laws. They produce movies like the Avengers and shows like Black Mirror, which play at the border of our imaginations and reality. We create space battles, bend spacetime, and conjure up all sorts of odd phantasmagoria for our minds to play with. Even more impressive are the immersive video games that include thousands of simultaneous players interacting in all manner of ways. Many of these games have internal economies and social hierarchies that are far larger than many real nation states.VR and AR is about to smash those sophisticated digital worlds into the real one. All of a sudden, all those years spent developing fantasy worlds weren’t fantasy at all. They were designing augmentations for the real one.Futurists in the past mistakenly imagined a 50s-style robot butler bringing us our eggs in bed. The reality will be closer to Stranger Things - a ghost world existing in and around the real one, but interacting with it. You’ll still get your breakfast, but you’ll only see the butler if your VR glasses are on.Wind those clips out in your imagination. Think of everything you’ve ever seen in a video game or movie, and now imagine it happening in your kitchen. Then, remember that “the internet of things” is already creeping into our lives. Your dishwasher, car, broadcast media, music system…. all that can interact with those events. Many of our appliances are connected to the internet already, and increasingly so.
