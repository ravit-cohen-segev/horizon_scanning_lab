When applied to the real world this principle has many implications which are important in fields ranging fromAny sort of approximately steady state reaction of any kind needs to produce as much energy as it loses by whatever means, else it will be shut off by loss of energy. The loss of energy includes both energy production for use, and heat and other inefficiency losses.Steady state nuclear fusion reactions lose energy by mostly electro-magnetic radiation (light typically in gamma ray frequency ranges). Steady state nuclear fusion also needs very high pressures and temperatures to work at all.Thermonuclear fusion - WikipediaIn a( . . . )Also, high temperatures imply high pressures. The plasma tends to expand immediately and some force is necessary to act against it. This force can take one of three forms: gravitation in stars, magnetic forces in magnetic confinement fusion reactors, orIn a star, the many thousands of kilometers of hydrogen gas/plasma above the zone of fusion in the core of a star has two effects by gravity the immense mass of mostly hydrogen above that fusion zone creates immense pressure that contain the fusion, the other is that this immense mass of gas is opaque to electromagnetic radiation, it absorbs all the heat generated by the fusion in gamma rays and re-radiates it to adjacent gas at a somewhat lower temperature. The net result is that thick layer of very hot plasma acts as a blanket to keep the core hot.NASA IMAGE satellite,Ask the Space Scientist ArchiveHow long does it take light to get out from the inside of the Sun?According to the famous 'drunkard's walk' problem, the distance a drunk, making random left and right turns, gets from the lamp post is his typical step size times the square root of the number of steps he takes. For the sun, we know how far we want to go to get out....696,000 kilometers, we just need to know how far a photon travels between emission and absorption, and how long this step takes. This requires a bit of physics!The interior of the sun is a seathing plasma with a central density of over 100 grams/cc. The atoms, mostly hydrogen, are fully stripped of electrons so that the particle density is 10^26 protons per cubic centimeter. That means that the typical distance between protons or electrons is about (10^26)^1/3 = 2 x 10^-9 centimeters. The actual 'mean free path' for radiation is closer to 1 centimeter after electromagnetic effects are included. Light travels this distance in about 3 x 10^-11 seconds. Very approximately, this means that to travel the radius of the Sun, a photon will have to take (696,000 kilometers/1 centimeter)^2 = 5 x 10^21 steps. This will take, 5x10^21 x 3 x10^-11 = 1.5 x 10^11 seconds or since there are 3.1 x 10^7 seconds in a year, you get about 4,000 years.The issue I am pointing out is that the steady state fusion in stars has immense pressure that in fact magnetic confinement cannot approach in terms of pressure, and insulation that likewise a reactor on earth cannot approach.Further — and this is the critical issue — the very smallest stars that can sustain natural fusion are red dwarves.Red dwarf - WikipediaAThe coolest red dwarfs near the Sun have a surface temperature of ~2,000Smallest radii are 9% of the sun, the sun’s radius is 696,340 km, or ~ 62,670 km for the smallest practical red dwarf star.The energy loss by radiation of a hot object (like a star) is going to be proportional to the surface area which is proportional to the radius squared, while the reaction rate in terms of power produced will be proportional to the radius cubed.For the sake of argument I think most people can agree it is really impractical for humans to build a spherical reactor 2km in diameter (1 km in radius).So this human 1km radius reactor, let us say we get a magical force shield that contains whatever pressure we need it to contain — which we cannot do.So a 1 km radius spherical fusion reactor will have 1/(62670)^3 or 4.062E-15 times the energy production power of a red dwarf, but will radiate 1/(62670)^2 or 2.546 E-10 the energy of the red dwarf. So dividing the latter by the former,if our reactor is running at the same temperature it will flush away ~ 159,000 times as much energy as heat per unit energy produced as the red dwarf will.That is an INTRINSIC INESCAPABLE FACT OF GEOMETRY. So even if you could start the reaction, it will immediately shut off as you would be losing heat much faster than you can produce it.Remember, that red dwarf star is the minimum size for a natural thermonuclear reaction to happen is steady state.With a bomb, you are not attempting a steady reaction but rather a very fast quickly over reaction where the remnants of the fuel spread very fast away from the center, and you are using explosive lenses to push the blast in directions you want it to go, thus igniting fuel that is extremely dense, where you gathered fuel of very low ignition energy isotopes in a small pile.In my opinion, steady state thermodynamic equilibrium fusion is not possible in reasonable sized human built reactors.Pulse reactors that use pulse explosions — sure.The electro-static confinement method as proposed byPolywell - Wikipedia","220,640 followers",Franklin Veaux,5K,47.3K,783.1M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-reason-human-can-produce-explosive-fusion-energy-but-cannot-produce-steady-and-continuous-fusion-energy

Future wars will be fought for clean water; in fact, we’re already starting to see that now.But cheap fusion power? Cheap power makes water an inexhaustible resource. We can make fresh water from seawater; we don’t often do so because it requires absolutely prodigious amounts of energy. Cheap, nonpolluting energy solves water resource problems.Transportation! Modern transportation relies on oil. If you buy a plane ticket, most of the money you spend on it goes, not to the plane, not to maintenance, not to staff, but to jet fuel.Small fusion reactors in aircraft can cut the cost of air travel into one-third to one-fifth what it is now. And that doesn’t even consider that a plane can haul more people if you don’t have to carry all that jet fuel!Lockheed Martin is spending money in fusion research for this exact reason.

3,"I used to work on fusion simulation codes (particle in cell) with the US National Labs when I was at NVIDIA, and I was very interested in seeing if we could solve the problems with fusion and picked the scientist and engineers' brains endlessly.

From having many long conversations with these very intelligent and qualified people I realized that thereI used to work on fusion simulation codes (particle in cell) with the US National Labs when I was at NVIDIA, and I was very interested in seeing if we could solve the problems with fusion and picked the scientist and engineers' brains endlessly. My former father-in-law also worked at Lawrence Berkeley Labs, and was an engineer designing superconducting coil magnets and had decades of experience working with fusion researchers, even though his primary application was particle accelerators. From having many long conversations with these very intelligent and qualified people I realized that there are some really hard problems that block practical fusion, with no immediate solutions in sight.The only place we know of working, large-scale, energy-generating fusion reactions is at the center of a star, where the gravity of the massive star creates the necessary density, temperature, and time being held in that state at the core for fusion reactions to run continuously. This is called the Lawson criteria, and is hard to achieve. All of the layers of the star above that act as an energy exchanger, converting all the gamma rays and fast neutrons at the core into progressively less energetic wavelengths of light and motion of nuclei (heat) so by the time they reach the surface of the star, that energy is emitted as IR and visible light that heats and powers our planet's biosphere, and can provide photovoltaic energy to us as well. All of our efforts in fusion have been to try and reproduce this process on earth, in a small reactor that can provide practical energy.First I will talk aboutThe first problem with magnetic confinement is fundamental - no matter how strong or well formed the magnetic field containing the plasma is, it will always leak, as positive nuclei or ions spiralling around the magnetic field lines collide and scatter, eventually drifting out of the containment field. The only known solution is to make the reactor larger so the scattering ions take longer to travel to the plasma boundary, and thus more fusion can happen during that time. Pretty brute force.The world's most advanced magnetic confinement fusion power plant is ITER, which, to reduce the ion scattering problem mentioned above, is 6-stories tall and about the same dimension in diameter, containing the mass of 3 Eiffel towers, and it is still not expected to be large enough to contain a plasma long enough to sustain burning and produce continuous energy generation.A more practical problem is how do we extract the energy? Most of the energy in deuterium-tritium fusion reactions is released in fast, high-energy neutrons, which (because they are neutral, and have no electric charge) are not confined by the magnetic field, don't heat up the plasma, and have to be stopped by a thick shield, which then heats up, and can vaporize water to steam in order to power turbines and electrical generators. The problem is the constant bombardment by neutrons makes the shield material degrade with time, and become very radioactive, posing a problem for removal and disposal.Also, deuterium-tritium fusion reactions are currently used because they take place at the lowest energies and at the lowest plasma temperatures of all the possible fusion fuels, and thus are easier to ignite and keep lit. However, tritium is not found naturally in any significant quantities and needs to be manufactured in nuclear reactors. With today's production capacity, we just cannot make enough tritium to power even ITER continuously. We could use better fuels, like Helium-3 or Boron-11, which do not emit neutrons and thus 'burn clean', but the plasma temperature must be much higher and the confinement much better to ignite fusion and sustain it with these fuels. And while Boron-11 is plentiful, Helium-3 is so rare that scientists think that the best source of it is lunar regolith that has been irradiated for billions of years on the moon's surface. Any energy generation infrastructure that requires a regular supply of a moon-based fuel, even as energy dense as He3, will probably never work out.A proposed solution to the Tritium deficit is to construct the shield surrounding the reactor with lithium, which is abundant, and fissions into tritium when struck by neutrons, thereby 'breeding' tritium within the reactor itself. Of course, this comes with its own set of problems of how to capture, purify, and contain the tritium after it is released into the tokamak reaction chamber from the walls.Another issue is that when all of the superconducting magnets in ITER are running at full current (160,000 amps) to create the 13 Tesla toroidal magnetic field (13x that in an MRI machine) and to create the other plasma-shaping and heating fields, they are storing 60 GigaJoules, or around 12 Tons of TNT worth of energy. This is because the 180 kilometers of superconducting Niobium-Tin wires in all these massive magnet coils can carry enormous electrical current when supercooled with liquid helium.More info on the ITER magnets:But, if that cooling fails, the superconductor heats up, quenches, and becomes a normal conductor, and can no longer carry that enormous current. With 160,000 amps suddenly meeting resistance, the coil rapidly vaporizes, and causes a meltdown of the other coils, with a total energy release of 12 tons of TNT. This is very undesirable, especially when those coils are wrapped around a highly radioactive shield that also vaporizes and is expelled into the atmosphere. There are fault-detection systems, but it takes a while to dissipate that amount of energy safely, and there may not be enough time to react quickly enough in the event of a catastrophic magnet coil failure.So, some gotchas left to solve for practical fusion energy generation with magnetic confinement, with some perhaps not so easily solved.Inertial confinement fusionIt also has many of the same problems with energy conversion to electricity, and much worse wear and tear on the shielding from these small nuclear fusion explosions being set off, which also trashes all the precision equipment needed to hold the fuel pellet in the focus of the converging laser beams with extreme accuracy. So, a lot of practical damage control problems before inertial confinement fusion is a practical source of energy generation.While these problems may be solved, practical application is still a very long way off, and currently the main application of inertial confinement fusion is as an experimental testbed for calibrating computer codes used to simulate and design thermonuclear fusion weapons. As horrific as these weapons may be, the simulation codes developed for designing them (sorry maintaining them), are the one of the greatest tools for innovation in fusion energy. There is a hydrodynamics code which simulates the behavior of the fissile (and fusion) materials under extreme conditions of pressure and temperature, as well as transport codes that model neutron transport and scattering in the materials under these conditions, and many other bits and bobs. They are all standard numerical techniques, and the really classified part is the integration and calibration of all these codes with previous nuclear weapon tests from the past, and with these small scale simulations in the present.Electrostatic Confinement FusionBasically you need a vacuum container the size of a basketball and a pump to empty it. You put a small spherical wire cage the size of a golf ball in the center, and a larger wire cage the size of a bowling ball around it. You then pump out all the air, and apply a very large (10,000V) electrical potential between the two cages, with the small negative cathode at the center, and the positive anode at the periphery.Then you open a valve and let in a very small amount of Deuterium gas (commercially available) into the vacuum chamber, and it ionizes in the large voltage potential, the D+ ions in the periphery experience a very strong electric field (100K V/m), and are rapidly accelerated towards the center of the reactor, with enough energy to collide and fuse the deuterium nuclei (no tritium required). This fusion can be measured with an external neutron counter.Theoretically, power generation would be simple, as the fusion products consisting of highly energetic He3 and (few) H3 ions could be decelerated in an electric field and the current from that used to generate electricity directly.Here is ECG Herman’s excellent thesis paper on designing and constructing a Farnsworth Fusor:Although they seem like a obvious winners due to their simplicity and effectiveness, ECF reactors have several things limiting scaling:a) There is a limit to the deuterium gas density before performance degrades, so generation capacity is limited.b) Deuterium ions tend to collide with the wire cage cathode in the center, which absorbs them, heating the cage, and causing energy loss and contamination from metal atoms being dislodged.c) As the deuterium ions oscillate back and forth through the center, each time they change direction, they emit bremsstrahlung radiation, or photons of light, losing energy (this is how your dentist’s x-ray machine works).d) Scattering tends to reduce the nice, radial trajectories of the ions into a Maxwellian distribution over time, reducing the fusion that occurs.There has been work in using electromagnets at the periphery to try and hold a ball of electrons in the center, eliminating the need for a central cage… akaThermonuclear WeaponsIn the Teller-Ulam, two-stage, thermonuclear weapon, a spherical plutonium fission primary (with deuterium-tritium fusion fuel at the core to boost it) is imploded by conventional explosives, the plutonium is crushed far beyond critical density, fissions and detonates. The initial radiation released is contained and focused onto the fusion secondary to implode it, ignite fusion, and detonate it. I just mention this to illustrate the enormous energy needed to really reach the Lawson criteria in a large scale, but nuclear weapons kind of freak me out, so I'm going to refer you to the link to the Wikipedia article about them if you want to read more:Thermonuclear weapon - WikipediaSo, in summary, we should not shut down or stop building today's fission nuclear reactors, as commercial fusion reactors are not only far in the future, but also produce radioactive waste (their shielding, which needs to be periodically replaced), and Tokamaks can melt down catastrophically and explode if there is a cooling failure in the magnet coils during full power operation. They also do not run on seawater, like some say. We need expensive and difficult to produce tritium (which is also radioactive) to ignite fusion at the temperatures and densities that today's tokamak magnetic fields can produce.To advance fusion energy in your career, I think the best fields to study would be physics (classical, electrodynamics, plasma, quantum, nuclear…) and computer science, with a focus on numerical simulation. The actual physical fusion reactors are so expensive and time-consuming to build, test, and operate, that you may only get to iterate designs once or twice in a career, but computer simulations can take us in so many different directions more cheaply and easily by comparison.Perhaps there is some exotic stellarator magnetic confinement design, or advanced Farnsworth electrostatic confinement design that has not been explored in depth, that will turn out to hold the key to fusion energy. Simulation is probably the best first step to find it, unless you have a few billion dollars and several hundred kilometers of Niobium-Tin wire and helium cooling tubing to play with.Brent","220,640 followers",Franklin Veaux,3.2K,47.3K,783.1M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-reason-human-can-produce-explosive-fusion-energy-but-cannot-produce-steady-and-continuous-fusion-energy

The fusion core emits a large number of fast neutrons, and these neutrons are capable of causing fission in ordinary U-238. So the fusion core in such a bomb is surrounded by U-238, and the induced fission gives about half of the energy. It also gives almost all of the fallout. So in the neutron bomb, this layer is omitted, resulting in much less fallout. The emitted neutrons, which can kill anyone nearby, give the neutron bomb its name.If you are still concerned about what MeV means, it is a unit of energy that is very useful for nuclear reactions. It means “one million eV” where the eV (or “electron volt”) is an energy unit equal to 1.6 x10^-19 joules.","220,640 followers",Franklin Veaux,1.6K,47.3K,783.1M,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-reason-human-can-produce-explosive-fusion-energy-but-cannot-produce-steady-and-continuous-fusion-energy

The British government under Margaret Thatcher started paying “scientists” to do “research” and write “scientific” articles and papers proving that fossil fuels were too dangerous and the UK needed to switch to nuclear energy like the French did. The greens in the UK loved the idea, but weren’t keen on nuclear energy. The tree huggers in America supported getting rid of fossil fuel too, but hated the idea of nuclear power. So, for political reason, the U.S. government started paying “scientists” for anti-fossil-fuel “research” and “scientific” articles and papers too.All those “scientists” who agree that CO2 causes climate change are being paid to do “research” proving that CO2 causes climate change; then they are paid to write papers “proving” that CO2 causes climate change; but it’s all fake science. Real scientists know that they cannot prove any scientific theory. Science is advanced by disproving theories, not proving theories. If no one can disprove a theory, that theory may be accepted as true by some or many scientists until someone disproves it. Any real scientist can disprove the theory that CO2 causes climate change; that’s easy, but it’s not worth the trouble; it does not pay enough. It’s not worth losing your job; so you wait until you retire to do it. It’s politics versus reality.According to Google, the earth is 4,543,000,000 years old; man has existed for 200,000 years; civilizations have existed for 6,000 years; and industrialization which is said to be the cause of man-made climate-change started around 200 years ago, when the USA was founded in 1789. But, industrialization was only going on in a few nations in a small corner of Europe and a small part of the USA. CO2 on our planet has been increasing and decreasing since the beginning and climate has been changing since climate has existed. So, who was causing 4,542,999,800 years of climate change before we humans started to take over 200 years ago? I’m still waiting!The whole idea that man-made CO2 production is causing global warming or climate change is preposterous. It’s worse than the tail wagging the dog. It’s more like one hair on the tail of the dog wagging the dog. According to Google, the oceans contain 37,400,000,000 tons of CO2; the air contains 720,000,000 tons of CO2; and man-made CO2 is 6,000,000 tons. The oceans contain nearly all the CO2 on the planet, 98.11%! The air contains the rest 1.89%. All man-made CO2 combined is only 0.0156% of the CO2 on the planet! That’s 301 molecules out of every 1,000,000 molecules, 1 man-made molecule for every 3,322 naturally produced molecules; and good old Mother Nature cleans it all up. Nature keeps CO2 in check; humans do not need to do a damn thing about it!Ever hear of photosynthesis? If not, you must have dropped out of school by the eighth grade or slept through your basic science or biology course. All animals, people included, on land, in the air or in the sea, from the largest whale to the tiniest microbe, produce CO2 from plants or animals they eat and oxygen they breathe. (Yes, fish take oxygen out of water and put CO2 and other stuff into the water they all swim around in. Aren’t you glad you aren’t a fish?) All plants on land or in the sea grow by consuming CO2 from the air or water and producing oxygen that goes back into the air or water. Photosynthesis is what we humans call the process by which plants grow. Plants and animals live in equilibrium with one another such that they maintain a balance of CO2 in the atmosphere and the oceans and lakes. If CO2 increases plants grow more and consume more CO2. If CO2 decreases plants grow less and consume less CO2. That’s why CO2 is added to the air in a greenhouse. Something every marijuana magnate knows, or so I have been informed.The well-paid, man-made, climate-change advocates have it totally backwards. Increasing or decreasing CO2 levels do not cause climate to change. They can’t; it’s impossible for several reasons! Photosynthesis is only one of those reasons. Photosynthesis keeps CO2 in balance, in equilibrium. Animals produce CO2 and plants consume CO2, plants eat it. Now that’s what I call sustainability; we cannot get more sustainable than that! Mother Nature does it, no sweat, no problem. You don’t need to go to Mars to survive. That’s a good thing too. You could not survive on Mars; and Mars has climate change too.Natural climate change causes atmospheric CO2 to increase or decrease, from 500 to 1,000 years later, as shown by the best data we have. It’s the sun combined with the solar system that causes climate change. Did you forget about the sun? We didn’t cause climate change. Nobody did; it’s a hoax! It’s politics versus reality! You can prove it for yourself; a few hours before the sun sets, the air starts to cool and the temperature keeps dropping until the sun comes up again the next day. Then the air starts to heat up again until the sun starts going down.One of the laws of physics states that anything hotter on the surface than the interior is getting warmer and anything that is colder on the surface than the interior is cooling. Since the interior or core of the earth is estimated to be around 30,000 degrees F and the surface averages around 60 degrees F, we can be pretty sure that the earth has been cooling for a very long time, from day one, 4,542,999,800 (4.543 billion) years ago. It’s basic physics! So what does that have to do with climate change and CO2 you may ask? There was a lot more CO2 in the atmosphere millions of years ago. Back when dinosaurs roamed the planet 230 to 65 million years ago in the Mesozoic Era there was five times the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere than there is today. Could the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere be declining as the earth has been cooling? What would cause that?The sun is believed to be a very long lasting nuclear fusion reaction or explosion held together by incredible gravitational forces produced by the sun’s incredible mass. Like a camp fire, or a candle, the sun does not burn at a constant rate. For hundreds of years we humans have observed spots on the sun’s surface (sun spots) and sun spot activity has been directly correlated with surface temperature on earth – more sun spots equal higher surface temperatures and fewer sun spots equal lower surface temperatures on earth. As the sun causes surface temperatures to increase on earth the oceans slowly get warmer, but the oceans are so massive that this process takes hundreds of years. Remember, 75% of the earth is covered by water and it is several miles deep in most places. The deepest part of the oceans is 6.85 miles deep. The oceans contain 37,400,000,000 tons of CO2, 98.11% give or take, while the air contains 720,000,000 tons. The oceans contain almost 52 times as much CO2 as the air!CO2 and oxygen as well as other gasses are dissolved in water by rain, agitation from running downhill and wave action on water’s course to the oceans where wind and storms cause the oceans to dissolve more gasses from the atmosphere as well as from plants and animals in the oceans and their tributaries. But water can only hold so much gas and the lower the water temperature the more gas it can hold. (It’s just like soda water, which is CO2 dissolved in water. It will stay fizzy longer in the refrigerator.) Therefore, if the sun raises surface temperatures for a long enough period of time, the oceans start warming and releasing more CO2 into the atmosphere along with other dissolved gasses. It’s just like forgetting to put the soda water away; it gets flat. (Remember, the oceans have 98.11% of the CO2, 52 times as much as the atmosphere.) When solar activity declines with fewer sun spots, the surface temperature of earth gets colder; the oceans get colder and the oceans eventually dissolve more CO2 and other gasses out of the atmosphere and retain more CO2 produced by animals in the oceans.The earth does not rotate in a perfect circle around the sun either; the orbit is elliptical in shape; the distance of the earth from the sun varies annually causing the temperature of the earth’s surface to vary; the surface warms as it comes nearer the sun until the end of December; and the surface cools as it moves farther from the sun until the end of June. But, that is the way it is now; it has not always been that way.Changes in the earth’s orbit occur in cyclic fashion over thousands and millions of years as well. They are caused by non-linear, non-uniform variations in the solar system called Milankovitch Cycles; which cause the ice ages and the warming periods in between ice ages. Milankovitch Cycles are caused by variations in the sun, the moon and other planets in our solar system and their gravitational pull on the earth. When the earth is between the sun and Jupiter or Saturn the earth’s orbit is pulled away from the sun causing the earth to become cooler. When the sun is between the earth and the big planets the earth’s orbit is pulled toward the sun and the earth gets warmer. How do you think the politicians will fix that?Back in the Mesozoic Era when dinosaurs roamed the planet and there was five times the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere than there is today, the earth was much hotter than today. Do you think that the cooling of the planet might have been sucking gasses out of the atmosphere into the oceans and other bodies of water that cover 75% of the earth? If that is true, when do you think there might be too little CO2 in the atmosphere to support plant life? Did the extremely abundant plant life that covered the land in the Mesozoic Era become extinct? Was that loss of plant life caused by too little CO2 in the atmosphere? When there is too little CO2 in the atmosphere, plant life will become extinct; and without plants, all life will become extinct! Many real scientists think we need more CO2 in the atmosphere today. Eliminating all man made CO2 won’t make a bit of difference; 98% will end up in the oceans.

That $10 sMoney is a proxy for information-energy and that is a proxy mostly forYour $10 dollar bill (in this hypothetical case) purchased for you a $10 shirt. That $10 shirt cost the retailer $5 but that retailer had to exchange some of your time, for the time of their employees. So most of the remaining $5 bought the retailers’ employees’ time. After that retailer shipped the $5 to the shirt distribution company (say, Hanes), that company harvested a bit of “energy” from that $5 — they took a buck and used it to pay for the time of their employees.This process repeats over and over again through the supply chain. Every segment of the supply chain always takes some of the money to cover its costs of “time” and then passed on that money until it is recycled into the system at various points. This happens with every transaction because you added information (money) which signaled the system to distribute the money back through itself for all those who are owed for their investment of time into the system.You cannot have an economy without those signals.","10,526 followers",Didier Champion,10.8K,1.6K,16.9M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-reason-human-can-produce-explosive-fusion-energy-but-cannot-produce-steady-and-continuous-fusion-energy

The area of the brain that got damaged in Gage’s case was the left frontal lobe. He did however have major personality changes. He was ill-tempered, proliferous in his use of profanity, no longer stuck with plans, and treated others poorly. Gage’s friends found him “no longer Gage”.Image:Image: Images in clinical medicine. The tale of Phineas Gage, digitally remastered.Removing parts of the brain does not result in the consequences we expect. The brain has an amazing ability to rewire itself to perform completely different tasks when necessary. Bradley Schlaggar, a pediatric neurologist, transplanted the visual cortex from an embryonic rat’s brain into the brain of a newborn rat, in the area of the somatosensory cortex (responsible for such bodily sensations as pressure and temperature). Once the rat was an adult, autopsy revealed that the transplanted visual cortex was operating as the somatosensory cortex.Leah Krubitzer, a professor of psychology, performed a different experiment which demonstrated this amazing ability of the brain. She removed large pieces of brain in newborn marsupials. Autopsy of the marsupial adults revealed their brains had adjusted by creating the identical structures, in the same areas as a normal brain, but they were smaller so as to fit into the tinier space.Left and Right Brain HemispheresSo let’s start with removing a hemisphere (half the brain). It is hard to believe that we can even live with half a brain. However Elena del Peral does and unless she told you she had half a brain you would not know. She is a friendly, bright, fit young woman who attends college and works at a childhood cancer foundation and is on the dean’s list.Image:In utero she suffered a left-sided congenital stroke. She was diagnosed because she began to suffer severe seizures due to the fact that the diseased tissue from her left hemisphere was sending electric storms across her corpus callosum (the part of the brain that allows for left and right hemisphere communication). The doctors decided to perform a hemisphectomy (removing half of her brain).So what does the research tell us about removing half a brain? Studies of intelligence and behaviour were made before, and after hemispherectomy for infantile hemiplegia. Results showed that patients made gains in intelligence after loss of half of the brain, however behavioural changes occurred and remained consistent over many years.Image source: www.cartoonaday.comRight Hemispheric DamageLeft Hemispheric DamageSo let’s look at damage or removal at some of the major parts of the brain:Cerebral CortexThe cerebral cortex is the outer layer of tissue that covers the cerebrum (the part of the brain that includes the frontal, occipital, temporal and parietal lobes). It is composed of grey matter (mostly cell bodies), as opposed to the white matter below it (myelin sheaths of neuronal axons). It is highly folded, resulting in a much greater volume of the brain surface area in the confined volume of the skull. The corpus callosum (a thick band of nerves) connects the right and left cerebral cortex sides.Below are images of the lateral and medial areas of the cerebral cortex.Image: Lateral surface of the cerebral cortexThe cerebral cortex is responsible for most “higher order” or intellectual brain functions: thinking, reasoning, judging, planning, voluntary movement, and overall behavior.Injury to this area of the brain impairs judgment, dramatically changes personality, and results in problems with behavioural inhibition, focus and attention.Image: Medial surface of the cerebral cortexThe cortex has three distinct parts:Thus damage or loss of this particular area of the brain results in specific losses associated with the area of the cortex described above.ASource: London Natural History Museum:Cerebral Cortex FunctionsCerebral Cortex Injury ProblemsFrontal lobe:Image courtesy:The frontal lobe is responsible for helping us understand the thinking and experiences of others, and helping a person understand how to respond and behave appropriately in social situations. In autism and chronic post traumatic stress disorder the highway between the limbic system and the frontal lobe does not function properly. This results in a weak theory of mind for autistics, and an inability to process and let go of the trauma for people with PTSD.Image: James FallonThe frontal lobe has been divided into “cool” cognitive aspects of executive functions, (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex), and the “hot” emotional/motivational aspects, (ventral and medial regions).Damage to the the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex results in disturbances in intellectual abilities (intelligence) such as problems in time-line sequencing of behaviour, problem solving challenges, problems in planning, and working memory defects (known as metacognitive executive dysfunction syndrome).Damage to the ventro-medial region results in impairment in being able to inhibit impulses— both emotions and behaviour.Image:Damage or removal of this area of the brain is known as Dysexecutive syndrome. This results in deficits in recognizing facial and vocal emotional expression (which supports the weak Theory of Mind in people with autism spectrum disorder).Furthermore, executive skills are reduced. For example, research has looked at set-shifting ability in neurosurgical patients with localized excisions of the frontal lobes. The patients had a deficit in the ability to shift their attention from something that had previously commanded their attention, or to move to something which had previously been irrelevant.Frontal Lobe FunctionsFrontal Lobe Injury ComplicationsTemporal LobeImage courtesy:A temporal lobe resection is a surgery performed on the brain to control seizures. The procedure involves removing brain tissue in the lobe to remove the seizure focus. Most often the anterior and mesial (deep middle) portions of the temporal lobe are involved.Kolb & Wishaw (1990) have identified eight principle symptoms of temporal lobe damage:Occipital LobesImage courtesy:Located at the back of the brain—and thus are not particularly vulnerable to injury—the occipital lobes receive and process visual information. The occipital lobes also process colours and shapes. Whereas the right occipital lobe interprets images from the left visual space, the left occipital lobe interprets images from the right visual space. Damage to the occipital lobes can permanently damage visual perception.The Peristriate region of the occipital lobe is involved in visuospatial processing, discrimination of movement, and color discrimination.Occipital Lobe FunctionsOccipital Lobe Injury ComplicationsParietal LobesImage courtesy:The parietal lobes can be divided into two functional regions:Individuals with damage to the parietal lobes often show striking deficits, such as abnormalities in body image and spatial relations. Parietal lobe damage disrupts shape, size and color identification, and distance perception.Left parietal lobeRight parietal lobeBi-lateral damageSpecial deficits (primarily to memory and personality) can occur if there is damage to theLeft parietal-temporalTheParietal Lobe FunctionsParietal Lobe Injury ComplicationsCerebellumImage courtesy:Known as the ‘little brain’, it manages movement (but does not initiate it), maintain posture and balance. It also controls fucntions like attention and language and the regulation of the fear and pleasure responses. It receives information from the sensory systems, spinal cord, and other parts of the brain, and uses it to coordinate movements. It allows a person to perform rapid and repetitive movements like running.You can live without a cerebellum. Some rare conditions exist calledCerebellar hypoplasiaCerebellar agenesis:Cerebellum Brain FunctionsCerebellum Injury ProblemsBrainstemImage courtesy:The brainstem is connected to the spinal cord, and is responsible for controls unconscious functions (respiration, digestion, and pulse). Three structures comprise the brainstem: the midbrain, the pons, and the medulla oblongata. The midbrain controls eye movement and focus. The pons sends signals back and forth between the cerebrum and cerebellum. The medulla oblongata controls respiration, blood pressure, pulse rate, and digestion.The brainstem is responsible for vital survival functions,thus damage is often fatal. People who survive brainstem injury usually require assistance with simple physical functions like breathing and regulating pulse.Brainstem FunctionsBrainstem Injury ProblemsSource:The Limbic system is primarily responsible for our emotional life, and has a lot to do with the formation of memories.Limbic SystemDamage to the Limbic system may cause:Corpus CallosumThe Corpus Callosum is the area of the brain that connects the left and right hemispheres. It was well know due to Split Brain Syndrome, where it was cut to prevent severe epilepsy. Damage to the area interrupts the steady flow of information between the left and right hemispheres of the brain. When cut it prevent the left hand from knowing what the right hand is doing and visa versa.And just for fun, you can test your self.
