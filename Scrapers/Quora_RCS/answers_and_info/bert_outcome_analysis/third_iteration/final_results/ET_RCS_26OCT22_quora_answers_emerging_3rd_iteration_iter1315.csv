In wars, a strong defence is as good as a powerful offence. The army always imagined having force fields to protect its forces. However, they need not keep waiting for it. UK scientists have already invented force field based on electromagnetic signals that can defend any army from attacks. The army definitely covets this one thing from among the 10 future technologies that already exist.1).2).Iron ManIron man haThese are few technological advancements which is the future , according to me :1).Force FieldThe army has always wanted to enhance its effectiveness by building impregnable defences.

The army definitely covets this one thing from among the 10 future technologies that already exist.1).2).Iron ManIron man has given people an insight into the world of exoskeletons. These are powerful armours that can give people additional strength to jump, run or lift heavy weights. And it is not just Iron man who can now do these things. Scientists have been able to invent such exoskeletons already, which can now be made available to general public, very soon. This is surely one of the most popular among additions to the 10 future technologies that already exist.3).Hover CarsHover cars have always been considered too futuristic. People believe that it’s impossible to have cars that can fly and we are happy with thinking of them as part of movies or documentaries. However, this is one of the 10 future technologies that already exist. Israeli scientists have been able to create unmanned battle vehicles for army evacuations.4)CloakingThe idea of invisibility is fascinating. As kids, we all wanted to imagine how it would feel to be invisible. However, we still thought it’s just restricted to realm of imagination. This is another one of the 10 future technologies that already exist. Cloaking devices are already a reality. Scientists in UK have been able to make a paper clip invisible by use of meta materials. This is another addition to the 10 future technologies that already exist.5).Hologram TVsThis would be one of the finest inventions till date.We are all amazed by hologram TVs that we see in Hollywood movies. We look at them in wonder and believe that they are something our grandchildren will enjoy. However, we need not despair. This is one of the 10 future technologies that already exist. Prototypes have already been made and the Japanese broadcaster will have a fully functional version out in 2017.6).Wireless PowerWe are all fed up with devices that need to be constantly charged with a real charger that we need to carry around. The inconvenience of this necessity has given rise to desire amongst people to see a wireless charger. People don’t think that this is available today. However, this is one of the ten future technologies that already exist. The feasibility of this device was demonstrated in 2008.7).Retinal Implants8).Human Organ Printing .are few things that i am aware as of now :) Let’s expect more in the future !",4 followers,Leon Brennan,24.9K,693,21.5M,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-will-be-the-next-future-technologies

This revolution will share workplace as well, in a manner that work will no more be 9 ~ 5, or confined behind the desk.The trend is as much scary as it is encouraging —You may say, you already work from home and join your teams remotely via Web Conferencing. But that concept of work is still Industrial Age old where work used to be measured by hours put in, and widgets being produced. Productivity was measure of ‘number of widgers’ / ‘time spent’. Most of these jobs are going away — robots, automation or machine learning will make it completely go away. Most of the managerial work will also be replaced with the bots.In next 10 years workplace will become ubiquitous — most of the people will be connected to work remotely, they will be working while on road, offices will transform tobecome places where people meet up to develop personal relations. Communication technology of future will be nothing as we know today — AR / VR will make certain kind of work much more collaborative, immersive and satisfying. Location, and time zone will become irrevalant.Areas such as cyber security and Information Technology will have more and more jobs. More and more people in these areas will be working without keyboards, mouse and monitors and more with gamelike immersive technologies. Tech devices of today including laptops, mobile phones are just too primitive. If this surprises you, look back how you worked 10 years back. In next 10 years, human-computer-interfaces will be more voice, gestures, and brain/thoughts enabled. More and more wearable will replace standalone devices.People will work consciously as well as subconceously (like whole sleeping). People will decide to work while they are on vacation. And all of these will be good for individuals and for society as a whole.Most of the companies will have unlimited vacations, and will measure work from outcomes and results. As you can see from my commentary, I believe the age of manufacturing, agriculture and production will get severely limited and more and more jobs will be knowledge and service oriented.It’s not just the workplaces, there will be more new jobs in industry that are accessible by very few. New areas will engage more human involvement into nano-tech, space research, healthcare, neurosciences, climate protection to name just a few.Now 10 years may be a short timeframe. But the trend has already started, and there’s no way you can go back, unless you run away from civilization. But that may also happen — there will be places in all parts of the world which will be called ‘reservations’ and in those area people will still reside to uphold their old way of doing things — working, creating produces, manufacturing etc. Much like Amish & American Indians.",18 followers,Asim Qureshi,17K,996,156M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-will-be-the-next-future-technologies

Absolutely zero.Few people understand how many decades of fighting there was in the United States before shots were ever fired.We can trace back government policy whose sole purpose was to prevent a civil war from happening at least 50 years before the civil war broke out. You could even argue it happened much earlier than that. The north/south split was a major and long lasting issue dating back to our founding.The split was so severe that dating back to 1830s, members of Congress would arm themselves on the Senate floor out of genuine fear of getting attacked. This was 30 years before the war. Senators genuinely felt another senator may try to kill him. We have members of Congress bringing arms to Washington today, but it's not the same. They are doing it for optics. They don't genuinely believe Nancy Pelosi or Mitch McConnell are going to shoot them from the dais.This came to a head in 1856 where one member of the house tried to kill a senator. He beat him within inches of his life.We play it off today as quippy anecdote. LOL those silly senators. This is because we're so far removed from that setting that it's impossible for us to genuinely believe this was an attempted murder.During the attack, Charles Sumner was unable to see because he was blinded by the amount of blood flowing over his face. He was eventually knocked unconscious. The other guy continued to beat him anyway.This wasn’t a the result of a temper tantrum. It wasn't some random act. He came there that day to walk up and kill him. He chose a cane because it would be far more humiliating. He was correct, fact it was a cane is exactly why we don't take this event seriously today.The attacker’s allies on the Senate floor even formed a blockade around the two. They were brandishing pistols and threatened to shoot anyone who tried to intervene as pleaded to spare his life. We nearly had a full blown gunfight between congressmen.Eventually, some of Sumner’s allies were able to break through the wall. Cooler heads prevailed, no shots were fired, and the situation didn’t escalate. By this point Sumner's unconscious body was beaten so much the cane had broken into several pieces. This wasn't a simple stick. It was a genuine club with a metal top. One of the many errors in the political cartoon above is it depicts him holding the metal top and striking with the wood. All accounts of the event agree he was striking Sumner over the head with the metal portion of the cane.Sumner survived but needed three years to recover. It is suspected that he suffered brain inquiries. His attacker had to pay a fine and even got reelected.Sumners opponents made commemorative rings out of the broken cane. They proudly wore these on the Senate floor. The man who almost killed him was given many more canes afterward as tokens of appreciation and encouragement. He not only escaped punishment but people thanked him for nearly killing a fellow member of Congress on the Senate floor.The conditions that allowed this outrageous event to take place were quite extreme. Yet, we were still five years away from civil war.A review of the history of the American government and you’ll see that the US was fending off civil war for many decades before it actually happened. Many of the actions of our government in the hundred years leading up the war was about finding solutions to prevent the country from splitting. Most people in government who were either attempting to start or prevent a civil war were deceased by the time the war began. None of the people who fought the war were alive when the possiblity of one first came to light.Looking at things now, yes it looks quite bad. The situation is certainly much worse than 20–30 years ago. This makes a lot of people scream for the hills with “zomg civil war is on the horizon.” It’s not. We’re not even close. What happened was we’d gotten along so unusually and atypically well for such a long time that we’ve lost perspective.This is the norm. Our founding fathers drank heavily and regularly got in fights with each other. They slandered each other in the press. Not just on policy but personal attacks as well. When Burr killed Hamilton in a duel, Burr was the standing Vice President and Hamilton was our top military officer. That's the equivalent of Kamala Harris killing the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.It's just insane how the US was the truly the wild wild west even before the wild wild west. Andrew Jackson also killed many people in duels. Hamilton's son was killed in a duel as well. Nor were they even polite to each other. When John Adams was president, his rivals openly addressed him as a fatass at formal occasions. Can you imagine if Obama introduced Trump at his inauguration as President Fatass? That's just an impossibility today but used to be the norm.We’re also nowhere close to the kind of strife and disunity found in the decades leading up to the civil war.

If you don’t know what grade someone is in guess one grade higher than you think. It’s not fun to be called a sophomore when you are a junior or senior when the person is younger than you.7. Join a sport. Find something you like and practice. Nothing is more fun that having friends in and out of school. These relationships will lead to a lot more fun later on.8. If you are going to drink or smoke, do NOT put it online. That is a straight shot to screwing up your life.9. Drink water and wash your face. You will look and feel better.10.
