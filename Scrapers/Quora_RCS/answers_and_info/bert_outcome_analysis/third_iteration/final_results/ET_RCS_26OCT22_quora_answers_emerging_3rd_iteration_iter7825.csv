Human error has been part of the problems so new training and procedures have been added. Still, nuclear power remains one of the safest and cleanest forms of energy available.But current Pressurised Water Reactors, PWRs, remain inefficient, expensive, slow to build and complex to operate.Next Generation Reactors, Generation 4, are currently being developed. These reactors are highly resistant or immune to meltdowns. Mainly by using inbuilt features that can work automatically with the need for human intervention. No AI or internet needed but they could be added. The next step in Generation 4 reactors is the need to build prototypes to prove their safety and capabilities.China has just started operation of a new gas-cooled pebble bed reactor the uses heat resistant spheres that contain fuel. Able to operate at much higher temperatures without melting. And air cooling systems that do not need power or pumps to keep the temperatures down. This system does not need to be shut down for refueling. The fuel spheres are regularly removed, tested, returned or replaced. They will have a much longer lifespan than fuel rods so they will be able to burn fuel more efficiently producing much less waste.China is also building an MSR, Molten Salt Reactor, reactor and possible a Sodium Cooled Traveling Wave Reactor. The MSR system is highly efficient and burns up most of the nuclear material leaving very little waste. It has the fuel mixed with the salt and it can be quickly removed at any time from the reactor to a safe cooling tank. This will be done automatically if needed without human intervention and no need for power or pumps. Some of the fuel mix can regularly be removed or placed into the reactor with any shutdown. The liquid mix allows for easy refueling or removal of valuable and useful nuclear products. For materials used in science, industry, space or medical uses.The Sodium colled Travelling Wave Reactor, TWR, uses a slow-burning fuel system that lasts for years. It uses depleted Uranium waste for fuel that is abundant and cheap and held in large stockpiles so no mining would be needed. The depleted Uranium comes from the Uranium enrichment commonly used in PWR reactors. This system is mostly self managing and is very easy to operate.Many of these reactors can be small or modular. So they can be easily transported to where they are needed. They could be built in factories for efficient and cheaper production and rapid construction. They are easier to operate with less staff. They can use nuclear and mining waste as fuel and even burn up nuclear weapons-grade material reducing proliferation risks.Efficient burning of the fuel produces much less waste and leaves less material for weapons use. The MSRs can use Thorium as fuel which is a byproduct of rare earth mining. Making it very cheap. It is also easy to handle and does not need expensive or dirty enrichment. Thorium is 3 times more abundant than Uranium and all of it can be used as fuel.The ideal solution for nuclear energy is Fusion. As used in the sun. But it may take decades A Chinesetest reactor has produced plasma at 2 times the heat of the sun for 100 seconds. A world record. The very large international ITER reactor being build in France may be operational by 2025. But these costs over $10 billion so actual power-producing fusion reactors may be far too expensive. If at all possible. But the safety risks would be minimal with no long term nuclear waste. And the fuel can be produced for free from water.So for vital low carbon energy Generation 4 fission reactors remain a faster option for cheap, low carbon energy. The efficiency of Gen 4 reactors could compete with gas. Having no risk of meltdowns, steam explosions or hydrogen explosions these reactors could use very much cheaper and smaller containment buildings. Or could be placed underground for security.These reactors are in development in many countries but lack support. So China has been able to take the lead in development. Some reactors using US research and technology. US production of prototypes has not yet started but they are gaining vital political support. The US-built successful MSR prototypes in the past but the programs canceled for political reasons. Along with anti-nuclear activists, there are strong oil, gas and coal lobby groups with long, historic connections and rich backers.There are some very good reasons to develop Gen 4 prototype reactors. Despite all the arguments by anti-nuclear groups that oppose all nuclear power. Many new nuclear reactors are already planned for future construction in a number of countries. This can not be stopped by anti-nuclear groups. But better and safer reactors with low carbon power would be a better option. China and India alone are planning to build over 50 nuclear reactors. They are building many different types of reactors so they can decide and use whichever are best.Other arguments are that they cost too much to develop and take to long to be of any use. Both of these arguments fail to recognize the need for low carbon energy options and the resources we have to develop and build these reactors. Solar and wind power will not replace fossil fuels within the next 20 years. And with the costs of global warming, the cost of developing Gen 4 nuclear is cheap. A number of prototype reactors could be built for less than the cost of an aircraft carrier. Production reactors would be much cheaper than current PWR reactorsCheap in terms of military spending as well. And global warming will be a significant global security risk. If global warming theories prove to be accurate. Either way, Gen 4 technology can be timely, at reasonable cost and effective. Most of the technology exists, the industrial capacity exists, the reactors will be cheaper and faster to build. And they will cut down on other pollution problems. Including reduction of high-grade nuclear waste. Production reactors could be ready in 10 years. And the costs of Gen 4 power will be competitive with coal and gas.They are building US, Russian, European and Canadian reactors as well as indigenous ones. Gen 4 reactors will be an option if the prototypes are built, tested and their capabilities proven. Generation 4 reactors will also be needed to replace older reactors that are reaching the end of their economic lives.Currently, there are many Gen 4 designs that could be built as prototypes before production power reactors can be built. In the US it is very hard to build Gen 4 reactor prototypes without significant government support. Many small US companies are developing the technologies. Fusion technology also. It would be nice to see other countries building prototypes.AI can play a role in future but the current need is for production of prototype Gen 4 reactors to provide safer, cleaner and cheaper nuclear power.",1 follower,David McFarland,1.3K,2.1K,6M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Is-it-possible-to-use-an-A-I-or-Internet-of-Things-to-prevent-a-nuclear-disaster-just-like-in-Chernobyl-Fukushima

Better information would have probably prevented Chernobyl, but information was not allowed to flow freely even among those who really needed to know, in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.

Indeed this was so before that Chernobyl incident.The fact is that even at the time no other design of reactor being used anywhere in the world could fail this way even if the operators wanted to make it so do.Having said all that the fact is that Chernobyl showed just how safe nuclear energy is — the worst possible design operated, in the worst possible way, still only had about 50 immediate casualties. Well the debate will go on over how many indirect casualties this accident caused given the amount of time since the event, we can safely say that the projections made at the time were clearly overestimates. As it stands any estimate made is now lost within the statistical noise of that region due to other health issues.But to answer the second part of your question, the collection of small modular reactor designs that are being worked on right now plan to be what is called “walk away safe,” that is they will not fail catastrophically even if left unattended for an extended period of time.And indeed as you guessed this will be accomplished by advances in command and control, materials and design factors.",137 followers,Andrew Karam,599,9.7K,31.8M,2015,https://www.quora.com/Is-it-possible-to-use-an-A-I-or-Internet-of-Things-to-prevent-a-nuclear-disaster-just-like-in-Chernobyl-Fukushima

I guess Jimmy sure showed Pakistan and North Korea!Why would you stop reprocessing before you got to high grade plutonium?Simple: it’s usable a fuel in nuclear reactors. That’s right! Nuclear: natures best renewable energy!What about the other radioactive materials?They are usable for the contrast dyes for contrast CT scans, contrast MRIs, treating thyroid cancer, and non-Hodgkins lymphoma, and other diseases.Wait… if that’s true, where do we get the stuff we use in medicine today?!?We buy it from Mexico and Russia! Those evil Russians, treating our strokes and other diseases!But wait… what if we siphoned off some of it, and made high grade plutonium anyway, wouldn’t that be bad?Well, it’s usable for RTGs — Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generators. What good are those for?Well, we used to use them for pacemakers, so we didn’t have to go back and replace the batteries every few years, like we have to do with pacemakers today.Where else is it used? Well, the Voyager spacecraft. The Viking rovers. The Mariner spacecraft. Deep sea probes. There are places you want to explore, where there is no way to use wind or solar.But we do those things today! Where do we get the plutonium for that!?!We buy it from Russia!They used to have a lot of lighthouses, powered by RTGs. They would last forever, and keep ships from running aground. And they would last…. well, practically forever.Russia is in the process of dismantling these light houses, one by one these days, and replacing them with electric versions.That seems like a bad idea; if they are doing that, they must have a good reason..What is it?To sell the plutonium to the U.S., silly. We prefer to put our nuclear weaste in 50 gallon drums, and store it in man-made cave under Yucca mountain. Instead of reprocessing it.And how much was would there be left, if we did reprocess it?Thimbles full.Which we could get rid of very easily, by building a couple of breeder reactors, creating more nuclear fuel in the process, and destroying what waste we had left by turning into other elements. That could be used for nuclear medicine and more reactor fuel.So why aren’t we using more nuclear energy, and reprocessing today! It sounds great!Wait… why is #2 bad?!?Don’t be silly! If it doesn’t produce greenhouse gasses, then you can’t buy carbon credits from them, so you can claim your business is “carbon neutral”, when it’s not!Unlike those huge natural gas generators California uses for >60% of it’s electricity, which belch CO2 all day long… plenty of carbon credits there!","24,642 followers",Terry Lambert,1.2K,23.1K,77.3M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Is-it-possible-to-use-an-A-I-or-Internet-of-Things-to-prevent-a-nuclear-disaster-just-like-in-Chernobyl-Fukushima

In fact you are more likely to die from a gun shot from the security guard at the plant than you are to die from the radiation.There is the other thing you need to know about nuclear radiation is that you either die from it immediately, or you’ll get cancer later on in life. The latter is what happened to John Wayne when he filmed theYes, this is actually true.John Wayne was a heavy smoker, but he didn’t die from smoking. He died of stomach cancer.Dr. Robert Pendleton, then a professor of biology at theHere are two reasons why nuclear energy is cleaner than coal. For one it doesn’t use coal. The other is energy output vs. fuel expenditure. You actually get more power out of nuclear reactors for less fuel. Whereas coal you need more fuel to get the power you need.That’s why nuclear reactors are cleaner. A small amount of fuel goes a long way when it comes to nuclear reactors. Meaning nuclear power is more efficient than coal. And the waste is easily stored. Also nuclear reactors produce less waste compared to coal fired plants. YUP! LESS WASTE. Coal waste is also toxic. It’s highly toxic. And you get more of that waste when you use fossil fuels.Nuclear power produces less waste. So, more efficient.And just to give you an idea of the power of uranium.You can’t get that from coal. Nuclear reactors literally pay for themselves.Next we’ll get to the generation of reactors we are currently using. It’s Generation 2 by the way. And here’s the problem. Gen 2 reactors should have been phased out long ago. Unfortunately a combination of eco-nuts such as yourself and the government is the reason why we’re still running them.Crazy environmentalists are keeping newer reactors from being built. All because of the scary waste, without realizing that newer generation reactors such as molten salt reactors, actually reuses the waste.You want to solve all of California’s energy problems? Stop being a bunch of whiny eco-freaks and remove the ban on nuclear power from that state. Build Gen 4 nuclear reactors, and no more blackouts. Your problems would be solved.The government is the other issue. You see the byproduct of Gen 2 reactors is plutonium. Which goes into our nuclear weapons arsenal.And there you go.Okay, people are saying I didn’t mention that fly ash is radioactive. Yes, it is. It’s nasty stuff. It also contains an enormous amount of heavy metals. What is uranium? A heavy metal. It is very nasty.How do I know how nasty fly ash is? This happened to my community in 2008.A nuclear reactor is not going to do that. That ash is filled with uranium, cadmium, cyanide, arsenic, lead. That is what is in the fly ash of a coal fired plant.You want to remind me about the nastiness of fly ash? The fallout that turned our sunsets red in December?

The amount of spent fuel produced by such a unit is about a cubic metre per year.A million persons in an advanced nation would have no problem securely disposing of one cubic metre of hazardous material per year. It helps that the material accumulates over time. Disposing of e.g. a hundred cubic metres (a cube a bit under 5 metres on an edge) in a hundred years is even easier.Because the volumes are so small, it is easy to keep each unit’s waste on the site for many decades, while its radioactivity decays, but it is also equally easy to concentrate the entire waste of a whole continent in a central location, for further economy of scale.Only about a third of the above volumes are waste material. Most of the remaining two thirds of the material could be recycled. This would of course also reduce the hazards of mining. However, antienvironmentalists have blocked the construction of industrial-scale recycling.Another important point isThe question is deceptive when it uses the word “toxic”. The hazard of wastes from nuclear power is radioactivity. The important difference is that toxic material remains toxic forever, but radioactivity decays away.The material that is mined for nuclear power, mostly uranium, is naturally radioactive. The total amount of radioactivity that each atom emits, before it becomes non-radioactive, is about the same, whether the atom is left in the environment, or used to produce useful energy.The difference is that, if an atom is used in a nuclear reactor, most of its radiation is emitted inside the reactor, where the energy serves humans, rather than in the environment, where some of that energy kills humans.This figureshows the rate of decay of spent fuel, for different fuel types. Both scales are logarithmic, so a slight drop of the line, when the spent fuel is highly radioactive, corresponds to a large drop in the amount of radioactivity.The lines are approximately straight over the long term. That is because the most intensely radioactive materials are the shortest-lived, and the longest-live radioactive materials are the least radioactive. Since each atom decays once, before it becomes a different atom, intensity and longevity of radiation are inversely proportional to each other.After about 4,000 years, the radioactivity of spent fuel is about the same as the radioactivity of the uranium that was consumed to produce that spent fuel. After that time, the net effect of nuclear power is to cleanse Earth of radioactivity.The part of spent fuel that can be recycled comprises the most long-lived radioactive materials. With recycling, the break-even time, after which nuclear power cleanses Earth of radioactivity, is only about 400 years. However, antienvironmentalists have blocked the construction of industrial-scale recycling.","105,674 followers",Dave Consiglio,4.5K,6.8K,91.6M,2021,https://www.quora.com/How-can-nuclear-power-be-clean-if-its-waste-is-toxic

There’s no actual burning of the fuel rods used to create power.To make fuel rods, Uranium Ore is processed to make a fuel rod that’s below ‘critical mass’, which is the necessary mass to create a continuous nuclear reaction. When the rods are inserted into the reactor, there are neutron-blocking control rods that are used to regulate the reaction. When the reactor starts up, the control rods are retracted and the reaction begins. To stop the reaction, the rods are allowed to drop back into place.When the fuel rods have been spent, they are extracted from the reactor and placed into large pools of water to cool for a long time (they tend to get pretty toasty). These cooling pools are incredibly safe, as water inhibits the residual radiation given off by the rods. In fact, you could splash around the top of that pool and still be incredibly safe from the radioactive rods below.Spent Fuel Rod cooling poolThe problem afterwards becomes long-term storage. In the United States, we used to use Yucca Mountain, but there was a lot of protests stating that Yucca Mountain’s location wasn’t secure enough, meaning the spent fuel rods have been piling up. Places like Yucca Mountain are underground facilities built to accommodate thousands of tons of spent fuel rods for permanent storage. There are other facilities around the world whose purpose is identical: secure the waste in a place that can’t be accessed without a lot of deliberate work even after the facility is sealed and secured.Now, beyond the lack of emissions, you might wondering why we’d use such a material. The reason is because nuclear fuel has the highest energy density of any fuel source.Image source: XKCDYes, you’re looking at that right.

Reactors are easier to build than bombs which have special requirements to be useful as bombs. So, reactors are build first to gain the technical, sicentific and engineering expertise to design a bomb using the desired energy process.1. theoryNuclear fusion bomb was first detonated 1 November 1954 with the Ivy Mike explosion. It used Lithium-6 isotope and deuterium isotope to produce helium-4 reaction products releasing 270.15 trillion joules per kilogram using a process conceived initially by Leo Sizilard again following Chadwicks neutron experiment and further developed by Ulrich Jetter in the late 1940s.The fusion reactors prodocued by Project Sherwood between Jetter’s experiments and Ivy Mike remain largely classified. Princeton worked on magnetic confinement fusion techniques and those not involving neutron flux were declassified and have become the money pit that is known as fusion research today.The practical reactors were briefly declassified by JFK for use by NASA in 1962 following his visit to Lawrence Livermore National Lab in December, and were reclassified by LBJ November 23, 1963, his first official act as President with Robert McNamara in attendance and advisory role.Of the few remaiining documents that I had the great good fortune of seeing after meeting with McNamara to discuss the use of ultra-low cost solar panels that produced hydrogen as stand along power plants at remote locations I read some documents that are still available to the public if you know where to look.Brookings Institute looked forward writing in the 1950s to how the workable fusion reactors would be incorporated into civiliian use to meet the needs of the 1970s — a period of time everyoe knew America would be running out of oil.There were three types of plants, that operated at three temperatures, which meant they had three methods of primary energy production.* Molten Salt Reactor — NEAR TERM — similar to existing nuclear reactors — molten Li6D operating at 1360 C boiled water at high pressure and produced very efficient elecricity at 74% about double standard coal fired plants which ran at 490 C. This was demonstrated with fissile fuel using the HTRE-3 reactor setup which used molten salt heated by a fission reactor to power the hot section of two J-57 turbines. — 1950s — 100 MW to 1000 MW modules.* Nuclear light bulb — molten Li6D amalmagmated with tungsten causing tungsten to glow at 3000 C using a multi-spectral photocell and emmitter tuned to capture 87% of the energy produced and 14% of the energy as waste heat. A 8 mm (0.31 inch) diameter sphere maintaining a constant 3000 C temperature radiates 1300 Watts of radiant energy.

It is very difficult to create these pressures on earth because we don't have the gravitational mass that a star has so we have to compensate by increasing the temperature even higher and doing what we can to confine the nuclei (magnetic confinement) so they collide. Raising the temperature this high requires a tremendous amount of energy and powering the confinement system does too. We can do it, but we haven't sustained it long enough for it to power itself (called breakeven -- where we are getting as much energy out as we are putting into it). Once we can achieve breakeven, the fusion reactor will then be able to power itself. Naturally though, even when this occurs, you basically have a little star on earth that has to be confined by actual materials instead of gravity, especially the supercooled electromagnets so that presents all sorts of engineering issues. The electromagnets keep the plasma from touching the walls of the container but again, once you start generating enough heat from the fusion energy dissipating, you have to get that heat out of there extremely quickly or else the temperature of the supercooled electromagnets increases which decrease the magnetic permeability -- weakening the magnetic field -- and thereby decreases the pressure... so then you stop fusing.","220,634 followers",Franklin Veaux,3.2K,47.3K,783M,2016,https://www.quora.com/Is-it-possible-to-use-an-A-I-or-Internet-of-Things-to-prevent-a-nuclear-disaster-just-like-in-Chernobyl-Fukushima

I cover a few below, take from myReducing Conduction:Conduction is the loss of mass.  The electrons and ions escape when they touch surfaces.  Energy leaves with this mass.  Conduction losses kill Fusors.  Fortunately, we can steer the ions and electrons.  Like cars on a highway, they will follow electric and magnetic field lines.  Hence any solution, cannot have fields that run into surfaces (high re circulation).  The Polywell is a fusor variant which follows this rule.  Tokamaks, the levitating dipole, spheromaks and stellarators all reduce conduction in the same way.  But, sharply curving fields are not perfect.  Plasma will drift outwards in a curved field.  This flings it against the walls [68].  This could be reduced by lowering the overall temperature [49, page 43].  The polywell and biconic cusp may also lose mass by scattering it through the center [52].Reducing Radiation:Radiation is the loss of energy.  Plenty of energy leaves the cloud as light.  Radiation includes visible, x-ray, infrared and ultraviolet.  When electrons are packed densely enough, they will reabsorb this energy [17].  This is why lead can absorb x-rays [53].  In plasmas, this critical density is difficult to reach.  The x-rays may also be reflected off the chamber walls [54].  However, the plasma may not be dense enough to reabsorb the reflected light [17].There (may) also be opportunities to tune the plasma.   Though thermalized bell curves are the most common plasma system, non-thermal plasma do exist and no one really knows how long they could be trapped for.  The plasma trap is inexorably connected to the energy distribution of the plasma inside it - and this really drives the radiation losses.  The hypothetical, ideal distribution for the polywell is shown below.Raising Efficiency:Efficiency may be the most unexplored concept in fusion.  Efficiency means changing the input and output energies.  Few groups explore lowering the input power.  The NIF system is horribly inefficient.  For every unit of laser energy, about 200 times that amount in electrical energy is used [69].  In response, the naval research labs have designed a 7% efficient laser.  However, without ignition this will not matter [70].Increasing output power means finding better ways to capture the energy.  Three methods have been purposed.  The first is using the neutrons from fusion to recharge fission material [71].  This seems unlikely for cost effectiveness.  It may be a good commercial application for fusors.  The second is using heat to capture the energy.  This method is valid for deuterium and deuterium tritium fuel and will have a typical power plant efficiency.  The last method is using direct conversion to capture the energy.Direct Conversion:Direct conversion uses a charged particles’ motion to make a voltage.  This voltage drives electricity in a wire.  This becomes the electrical power.  People usually see this process in reverse.  Ordinarily, a voltage puts a particle in motion.  Direct conversion does the opposite. It has been described is a linear accelerator running backwards [90].  William Barr deserves a share of credit for demonstrating direct conversion.  Over ten years he developed experimental and theoretical systems to prove this concept.  Dr. Barr retired from Livermore and passed away in 2004 [72].Material from a fusion reactor has positive ions, negative electrons and neutrals.  The exhaust comes in as random gas.  The converter has to beat this stuff into submission and extract energy from it.  The basic design is shown here [74, 75, 76].Bottom line: there are LOTS of good fusion ideas out there, and LOTS of unexplored approaches.  But, without the funding or manpower we will never know if they will amount to a commercially viable net power reactor.Citations:69.  Moses, Edward I.

This was a real contest at the time, and both technologies were tried and each had some commercial success. At the time, some early auto customers might have been skeptical that a vehicle powered by thousands of small explosions inside the confined volume of an engine block would be safe and there was doubt that an engine based on producing thousands of carefully timed explosions would be reliable and hang together and be practical in the long run. Over time, the public came to feel that internal combustion engines, even though they depend on thousands of small explosions, can still be practical and safe, and the Stanley Steamer, and other model continuous burning steam powered vehicles, were abandoned as not as efficient.In the next couple of decades we may see a revisiting of the debate over smooth burning Diffuse Plasma Magnetic Confinement Fusion versus Inertial Confinement Fusion featuring a succession small controlled fusion bursts of between 100 - 250 GJ per shot. It is a harder job to keep reliable containment of a plasma at fusion conditions on a magnetic confinement device like a large tokamak that does a continuous plasma burn - the containment tends to fail and the reactor has to periodically be restarted. ICF fusion has already been demonstrated to reliably produce energy on demand (in fission ignited fusion - first-time every-time).Accumulated experience suggests that the public is more comfortable with fusion power proposals that promise to produce fusion energy smoothly, in a continuous burn. Fusion technologies like ICF that reliably produce fusion in a succession of short controlled bursts are not as comfortable a concept (and tend to not get funded, even if they are in fact just as safe and are far more practical).During the cold war, the military was only interested in fusion devices that produced military relevant energy yields and blast effects. Big was good and was what the military requested of Lab weapons developers. Nuclear designers at LLNL and LANL were for the most part not funded to do sustained development of smaller fission-fusion and pure fusion devices intended for ultra-clean ICF power generation. Commercial ICF fusion would greatly benefit from the development of much smaller pure fusion devices. Devices producing a reliable fusion yield of about 250 GJ per shot, which is about 16X smaller in energy yield than the smallest thermonuclear device ever retained in the US nuclear arsenal.The military did not have interest in developing small ultra-clean devices specifically engineered for fusion power generation, so Lab nuclear designers never went very far in that direction. It can now be revealed that there was a well funded and well led effort to produce a tactical pure fusion device for the military that did not require a fission primary and as a result, would produce virtually no radioactive fallout. Such a device could be used in a military emergency as a “last stand” defense on friendly home soil against an overwhelmingly strong conventional tank-infantry assault.DOE published in 2001 the following document -RESTRICTED DATA DECLASSIFICATION DECISIONS 1946 TO THE PRESENThttp://www.fas.org/sgp/othergov/doe/rdd-7.htmlcontained in section C of that document are the following facts:Information on the DOE's pure fusion program:(1) Fact that the DOE made a substantial investment in the past to develop a pure fusion experimental explosive device(2) That the U.S. does not have and is not developing a pure fusion weapon; and(3) That no credible design for a pure fusion weapon resulted from the DOE investment.

If fusion drivers are designed that sufficiently resemble the characteristics and performance of X-ray driver used in Halite-Centurion experiments, there is no question that full fusion ignition with fusion energy gain will be practically achieved. Practical fusion is not a matter of guesswork or conjecture but has alreay been PROVEN in actual field experiments by both LANL and LLNL National Labs in the last years of underground nuclear testing at the Nevada Nuclear Security Site.NY Times article published at the time of Halite-Centurion field tests -","220,634 followers",Franklin Veaux,8.6K,47.3K,783M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Is-it-possible-to-use-an-A-I-or-Internet-of-Things-to-prevent-a-nuclear-disaster-just-like-in-Chernobyl-Fukushima

My former father-in-law also worked at Lawrence Berkeley Labs, and was an engineer designing superconducting coil magnets and had decades of experience working with fusion researchers, even though his primary application was particle accelerators. From having many long conversations with these very intelligent and qualified people I realized that there are some really hard problems that block practical fusion, with no immediate solutions in sight.The only place we know of working, large-scale, energy-generating fusion reactions is at the center of a star, where the gravity of the massive star creates the necessary density, temperature, and time being held in that state at the core for fusion reactions to run continuously. This is called the Lawson criteria, and is hard to achieve. All of the layers of the star above that act as an energy exchanger, converting all the gamma rays and fast neutrons at the core into progressively less energetic wavelengths of light and motion of nuclei (heat) so by the time they reach the surface of the star, that energy is emitted as IR and visible light that heats and powers our planet's biosphere, and can provide photovoltaic energy to us as well. All of our efforts in fusion have been to try and reproduce this process on earth, in a small reactor that can provide practical energy.First I will talk aboutThe first problem with magnetic confinement is fundamental - no matter how strong or well formed the magnetic field containing the plasma is, it will always leak, as positive nuclei or ions spiralling around the magnetic field lines collide and scatter, eventually drifting out of the containment field. The only known solution is to make the reactor larger so the scattering ions take longer to travel to the plasma boundary, and thus more fusion can happen during that time. Pretty brute force.The world's most advanced magnetic confinement fusion power plant is ITER, which, to reduce the ion scattering problem mentioned above, is 6-stories tall and about the same dimension in diameter, containing the mass of 3 Eiffel towers, and it is still not expected to be large enough to contain a plasma long enough to sustain burning and produce continuous energy generation.A more practical problem is how do we extract the energy? Most of the energy in deuterium-tritium fusion reactions is released in fast, high-energy neutrons, which (because they are neutral, and have no electric charge) are not confined by the magnetic field, don't heat up the plasma, and have to be stopped by a thick shield, which then heats up, and can vaporize water to steam in order to power turbines and electrical generators. The problem is the constant bombardment by neutrons makes the shield material degrade with time, and become very radioactive, posing a problem for removal and disposal.Also, deuterium-tritium fusion reactions are currently used because they take place at the lowest energies and at the lowest plasma temperatures of all the possible fusion fuels, and thus are easier to ignite and keep lit. However, tritium is not found naturally in any significant quantities and needs to be manufactured in nuclear reactors. With today's production capacity, we just cannot make enough tritium to power even ITER continuously. We could use better fuels, like Helium-3 or Boron-11, which do not emit neutrons and thus 'burn clean', but the plasma temperature must be much higher and the confinement much better to ignite fusion and sustain it with these fuels. And while Boron-11 is plentiful, Helium-3 is so rare that scientists think that the best source of it is lunar regolith that has been irradiated for billions of years on the moon's surface. Any energy generation infrastructure that requires a regular supply of a moon-based fuel, even as energy dense as He3, will probably never work out.A proposed solution to the Tritium deficit is to construct the shield surrounding the reactor with lithium, which is abundant, and fissions into tritium when struck by neutrons, thereby 'breeding' tritium within the reactor itself. Of course, this comes with its own set of problems of how to capture, purify, and contain the tritium after it is released into the tokamak reaction chamber from the walls.Another issue is that when all of the superconducting magnets in ITER are running at full current (160,000 amps) to create the 13 Tesla toroidal magnetic field (13x that in an MRI machine) and to create the other plasma-shaping and heating fields, they are storing 60 GigaJoules, or around 12 Tons of TNT worth of energy. This is because the 180 kilometers of superconducting Niobium-Tin wires in all these massive magnet coils can carry enormous electrical current when supercooled with liquid helium.More info on the ITER magnets:But, if that cooling fails, the superconductor heats up, quenches, and becomes a normal conductor, and can no longer carry that enormous current. With 160,000 amps suddenly meeting resistance, the coil rapidly vaporizes, and causes a meltdown of the other coils, with a total energy release of 12 tons of TNT. This is very undesirable, especially when those coils are wrapped around a highly radioactive shield that also vaporizes and is expelled into the atmosphere. There are fault-detection systems, but it takes a while to dissipate that amount of energy safely, and there may not be enough time to react quickly enough in the event of a catastrophic magnet coil failure.So, some gotchas left to solve for practical fusion energy generation with magnetic confinement, with some perhaps not so easily solved.Inertial confinement fusionIt also has many of the same problems with energy conversion to electricity, and much worse wear and tear on the shielding from these small nuclear fusion explosions being set off, which also trashes all the precision equipment needed to hold the fuel pellet in the focus of the converging laser beams with extreme accuracy. So, a lot of practical damage control problems before inertial confinement fusion is a practical source of energy generation.While these problems may be solved, practical application is still a very long way off, and currently the main application of inertial confinement fusion is as an experimental testbed for calibrating computer codes used to simulate and design thermonuclear fusion weapons. As horrific as these weapons may be, the simulation codes developed for designing them (sorry maintaining them), are the one of the greatest tools for innovation in fusion energy. There is a hydrodynamics code which simulates the behavior of the fissile (and fusion) materials under extreme conditions of pressure and temperature, as well as transport codes that model neutron transport and scattering in the materials under these conditions, and many other bits and bobs. They are all standard numerical techniques, and the really classified part is the integration and calibration of all these codes with previous nuclear weapon tests from the past, and with these small scale simulations in the present.Electrostatic Confinement FusionBasically you need a vacuum container the size of a basketball and a pump to empty it. You put a small spherical wire cage the size of a golf ball in the center, and a larger wire cage the size of a bowling ball around it. You then pump out all the air, and apply a very large (10,000V) electrical potential between the two cages, with the small negative cathode at the center, and the positive anode at the periphery.Then you open a valve and let in a very small amount of Deuterium gas (commercially available) into the vacuum chamber, and it ionizes in the large voltage potential, the D+ ions in the periphery experience a very strong electric field (100K V/m), and are rapidly accelerated towards the center of the reactor, with enough energy to collide and fuse the deuterium nuclei (no tritium required). This fusion can be measured with an external neutron counter.Theoretically, power generation would be simple, as the fusion products consisting of highly energetic He3 and (few) H3 ions could be decelerated in an electric field and the current from that used to generate electricity directly.Here is ECG Herman’s excellent thesis paper on designing and constructing a Farnsworth Fusor:Although they seem like a obvious winners due to their simplicity and effectiveness, ECF reactors have several things limiting scaling:a) There is a limit to the deuterium gas density before performance degrades, so generation capacity is limited.b) Deuterium ions tend to collide with the wire cage cathode in the center, which absorbs them, heating the cage, and causing energy loss and contamination from metal atoms being dislodged.c) As the deuterium ions oscillate back and forth through the center, each time they change direction, they emit bremsstrahlung radiation, or photons of light, losing energy (this is how your dentist’s x-ray machine works).d) Scattering tends to reduce the nice, radial trajectories of the ions into a Maxwellian distribution over time, reducing the fusion that occurs.There has been work in using electromagnets at the periphery to try and hold a ball of electrons in the center, eliminating the need for a central cage… akaThermonuclear WeaponsIn the Teller-Ulam, two-stage, thermonuclear weapon, a spherical plutonium fission primary (with deuterium-tritium fusion fuel at the core to boost it) is imploded by conventional explosives, the plutonium is crushed far beyond critical density, fissions and detonates. The initial radiation released is contained and focused onto the fusion secondary to implode it, ignite fusion, and detonate it. I just mention this to illustrate the enormous energy needed to really reach the Lawson criteria in a large scale, but nuclear weapons kind of freak me out, so I'm going to refer you to the link to the Wikipedia article about them if you want to read more:Thermonuclear weapon - WikipediaSo, in summary, we should not shut down or stop building today's fission nuclear reactors, as commercial fusion reactors are not only far in the future, but also produce radioactive waste (their shielding, which needs to be periodically replaced), and Tokamaks can melt down catastrophically and explode if there is a cooling failure in the magnet coils during full power operation. They also do not run on seawater, like some say. We need expensive and difficult to produce tritium (which is also radioactive) to ignite fusion at the temperatures and densities that today's tokamak magnetic fields can produce.To advance fusion energy in your career, I think the best fields to study would be physics (classical, electrodynamics, plasma, quantum, nuclear…) and computer science, with a focus on numerical simulation. The actual physical fusion reactors are so expensive and time-consuming to build, test, and operate, that you may only get to iterate designs once or twice in a career, but computer simulations can take us in so many different directions more cheaply and easily by comparison.Perhaps there is some exotic stellarator magnetic confinement design, or advanced Farnsworth electrostatic confinement design that has not been explored in depth, that will turn out to hold the key to fusion energy. Simulation is probably the best first step to find it, unless you have a few billion dollars and several hundred kilometers of Niobium-Tin wire and helium cooling tubing to play with.Brent",UNKNOWN,Viktor T.

25,"As others explained, making nuclear fusion happen is relatively easy.But that kind of misses the point. What we want to do is making sustained nuclear fusion.Worse yet, we want to achieve a power density that exceeds the interior of the Sun by something like a factor of a million or so, but without the benefit of the one mechanism that the Sun relies on, gravitational confinement.To wit: Nuclear fusion happens in the deep interior of the Sun because the Sun is colossally massive (more than 300,000 times more massive than the Earth), so its self gravity compresses its interior to the temperaturAs others explained, making nuclear fusion happen is relatively easy.But that kind of misses the point. What we want to do is making sustained nuclear fusion.Worse yet, we want to achieve a power density that exceeds the interior of the Sun by something like a factor of a million or so, but without the benefit of the one mechanism that the Sun relies on, gravitational confinement.To wit: Nuclear fusion happens in the deep interior of the Sun because the Sun is colossally massive (more than 300,000 times more massive than the Earth), so its self gravity compresses its interior to the temperatures and pressures that are needed for fusion to take place.But very, very slowly and inefficiently. How slowly? It produces less than 300 watts of heat per cubic meter. That’s comparable to… a well-maintained compost pile. Its less than the power density of our human metabolism.That’s all. That’s what you get when you lump enough mass to make more than 300,000 Earths.We obviously do not have 300,000 spare Earths to play with, and it would not be very practical either. So we cannot use gravitational confinement. We are trying to use other means to confine the fusion fuel for sustained fusion.And we aren’t simply trying to mimic the Sun. We want to do better. After all, for a practical fusion power generating station, we want to be able to produce a lot more power, perhaps up to a few hundred megawatts of raw thermal power per cubic meter inside the reactor. So we are trying to best the Sun by a factor of a million, give or take.That is hard. That is, if I may use somewhat unprofessional language, damn hard. Insanely hard.Which is why, nearly 70 years after the first uncontrolled fusion explosion (aka. hydrogen bomb) here on the Earth, we still do not have working fusion power stations.I thank my generous supporters on",2 followers,Richard Muller,1.7K,2.3K,202.4M,2021,https://www.quora.com/How-can-nuclear-power-be-clean-if-its-waste-is-toxic
