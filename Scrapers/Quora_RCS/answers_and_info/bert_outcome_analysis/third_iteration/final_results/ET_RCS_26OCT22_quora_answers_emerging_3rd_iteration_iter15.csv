Nowadays, you can just type a few words and hit send, and it goes to the person almost instantly.","5,601 followers",Jarred Dunn,4.4K,399,21.2M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-top-technology-achievments-of-2016

Seats expected to cost $500,000.Along the way, SpaceX will look to develop larger launch vehicles, more efficient engines, and re-usable second stages. The company will continue to send resupply missions to the ISS and launch commercial satellites to maintain revenue.Hope that helps.
