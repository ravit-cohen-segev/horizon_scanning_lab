An ATGM is still easier to hide than this behemoth.Lastly, ATGM technology is rapidly advancing. Tandem warheads can defeat ERA, and newer systems are starting to experiment with a smaller decoy missile that flies in front of the primary one to force an APS system to engage the small one first, allowing the main one to impact the tank before the APS is ready to re-engage.","3,713 followers",Andy Duffell,1.6K,6.2K,26.2M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Why-are-towed-anti-tank-guns-not-made-anymore-They-are-cheap-easier-to-hide-than-tanks-and-can-fire-sabot-shells-which-are-resistant-to-the-APS-hard-kill-systems-and-ERA-that-defeat-HEAT-warheads-on-anti-tank-missiles
1,They're not practical anymore with the advent of ATGMs. Their mobility sucks and would quickly become an easy target after a couple of rounds whereas one man with a Javelin can fire and split quite rapidly before becoming a target himself.You can upgrade ATGMs to defeat new threats such as APS.EDIT- How big of an anti tank gun are you going to make? It'll need to be at least 105mm to pierce modern armor.

It will also have switch to travel mode (2 min.) Then redeploy (90 seconds) before its ready to shoot again.It's not WW2 anymore, enemy tanks will move quickly from a cover to another and can shoot while moving, they've got all sorts of optics to spot the hidden AT gun.Even if you get to shoot your towed gun first and hit, you will have to face the other MBT's, APC's and infantry that travels with your target and they'll most likely prevent you from moving the AT gun anywhere else, if not outright blow you up to smittereens.That's why it's easier to use vehicles, an MBT will be more able to reposition after shooting, repel infantry and APC's firing back at it. Its crew is protected by some very heavy armor while operating.Any other option like aircrafts or portable Anti Tank Guided Missiles will be more effective, they travel fast and either attack tanks from the top (weaker armor) and/or have the ability to defeat reactive or composite armor in the latest versions.One last negative aspect of towed AT guns, the manpower: a Sprut AT gun has a 7 men crew, most MBT's are only crewed by 3 to 4 men, portable ATGM's are typically a 2 men affair, fighter aircrafts and attack helicopters only need 1 or two people to operate them.FGM-148 Javelin, its missile will be guided to the enemy tank and hit it from the top.

Notice, in addition to moving your wrist vertically, you have to compensate with moving your wrist horizontally as well. In addition to your body. Now try pointing to an object further than you. Even harder?Imagine how much stabilisation your guns need, in addition to the horizontal rotation offered by the Turret. The engineering you need will be remarkable.“Da okay. I have friends who can do that easily comrade”There’s other factors my friend.Firstly, imagine you have an auto loader. Assuming we use the French Leclerc Carousell type of Loading system. The T series autoloader would not work, as you’ll need to widen the tank substantially. Therefore bustle mounted auto loader.Assuming you manage to squeeze 2 guns into a leclerc turret, you have to ensure that firstly that your guns have the distance to recoil back. Secondly you have to ensure that your auto loading system has the ability to feed the guns at an “off angle” with respect to the Turret.“Hah. Maybe like Capitalist Pig Dogs we can carry rounds like men”Well….Driver. Commander. 2 Loaders? 1 Gunner. Additional Gun probably means one more loader, and that means your turret has to accomodate one more person. The M1 Abrams is 3.6+m wide. You add one more person, and your gun, and it might be 5m wide. You also need to protect that additional 1.4+m of space. Your weight is going to increase by 40%.Even if you had an autoloader, you have your TC on one side of the turret, and your gunner either in between 2 guns, or to the other side. If its the latter, communication makes it very hard between the TC and Gunner. If in between, imagine how dangerous it would be for him to dismount in a firefight, or if he needs to evacuate.“Well comrade. What about guns on top of another?”Ah. Like the Koalitsiya prototype.As an artillery piece, it can get away with many of the indiscretions that one needs. It doesn’t need to land Rounds at the same spot, just close enough. Also notice the height of the Turret. It is Tall. You cannot fit such a Tall Turret, and armour it well enough to protect it from the frontal 60 degrees, without making it your tank either too heavy, or your tank too top heavy.Wow 300+ likes.

The two tanks were on the crest of a hill and had a perfect field of view over the valley. They opened fire with their main guns and killed several of our men in the infantry column.Especially in a counterinsurgency, where your enemy often doesn’t possess any tanks, MBTs are primarily used against infantry. Even the most sophisticated portable anti-tank missiles are inferior to an MBT’s weapon system.Tanks are very versatile weapons. Their main gun can be used to combat almost anything, except aircraft.

21,"Yes they do. But it is not the same twisting turning air show like the WWII prop planes did. Advances in missiles make them much more potent but far from a sure thing. Even the vaunted off axis missiles when coupled with a proper Helmut system aren't uber weapons. The whole point of off axis missiles is so you can use them in a “dog fight”.Modern “dogfight” actually begin at short BVR ranges.

Pressed home attack on a determined opponent is going to eventually create the twisty turn fur ball.One aspect of the BVR argument that gets overlooked is this. No missile is a sure thing. The assumption is that I will sneak up and nail you without your knowledge. Hard to do. Red Flag etc. don't fire actual missiles so they don't accurately simulate the whole engagement it isn't possible. The jig is up when I lock you up. Not realistic. It is as close as we can come and certainly if we train to avoid even lockup we will be safer.

Rig up some straps and hang maybe 50–90 pounds on your forearm. Now go fly one of your games.GRAYING/BLACKING OUTWith a video game, you sit there will perfect full vision. Try flying your game while looking through a tube, because with enough G forces your sight is reduced to tunnel vision. You can’t simulate that, but looking through a tube will give you a minuscule idea.THE M1 MANEUVERGoogle that term. Read all about it. Then when you dogfight on a video game, while looking through a tube, with a weight hanging on your arm, use every ounce of energy you have to squeeze all the muscles in your abdomen and legs as hard as you can and then try to breathe like the M1 directions say to do. Gasp. Pant. Try it. It’s exhausting just to sit in a chair with no Gs on you and practice.WEAR HELMET, BREATHE THROUGH HOSEWear a helmet the whole time, with a face mask and breathing through a hose. Your head will get “hot spots” after enough hours with the helmet on.Oh, and if you have an itch in the wrong place, you can’t scratch it.WEIGHT ON YOUR HEADFigure out a way to strap weights to your helmet because when you’re maneuvering for real, your head weighs 100 pounds. Oh, wait! Add the helmet, multiplied by five or ten, so maybe put 150 pounds of weight on your head.And now, if the game says an enemy is behind you, you have to turn around and look, with your 150-pound head! But there’s more!THE SPINNINGGot all that? Okay, now, figure out a way to rig up your game console and your screen to a swivel office chair and have someone spin that around to match what you’re doing in the fight. While you have the weight on your arm, looking through a tube, and doing the M1 maneuver.The first time I realized how challenging the spinning was going to be was in USAF pilot training when I read theIn other words, the T-38 could roll so fast that it would smack your head into the canopy and knock you out.In a video game, you get to yank that stick as hard as you can. So, now, in your spinning chair, looking through a tube, with a 50-pound weight on your arm, a 100-pound weight on your helmet, doing the M1 maneuver, while someone is spinning the chair in response to your stick movement, have another friend standing there with a baseball bat and he hits you in the side of the head if you go full deflection on your joystick—because I know you yank that plastic joystick around with no thought that yanking too hard could kill you—oh, sorry, give you a possible fatal consequence.Of course you get to wear a helmet, but your friend gets to hit you hard with the bat. And if you don’t keep flying perfectly after he does that, he kills you.PIXIES, ELVES, AND ELEPHANTSNow, set your swivel chair in the back of a van and when you’re pulling hard in combat, have a friend drive over a gravel road at high speed.When you get close to max-G’s for your jet, she gets into “the burble.” The whole jet rumbles. My best USAF instructor used this analogy:So, do it all in a van driving fast over a gravel road.Dear God, I’d love to go play with those elves again!UPSIDE DOWNA former A-7 Naval Aviator, David Tussey, added a comment about a factor I omitted, which isI have a picture in my mind of the first time I was flying on the wing in tight formation with nothing but blue sky on the other side of my lead, when the Earth gently floated down into view from above me! I had no idea I was upside down.Of course I saw that happen many other times, but the first time it happened wasFUEL, WEATHER, SYSTEM MALFUNCTIONSAnd while you’re doing all of that, try to imagine that you could run out of fuel and have to eject and be captured and tortured.And, before you start the fun part, you’ve been up for many hours briefing for the flight, flying there, hitting the tanker for fuel (which is a stressful challenge in itself), and then wonder when and if the bad guys will see you.And when was the last time you ate? Or peed?When you’re done with the fun part, then you have to fly back home, probably hitting the tanker again, even though you’ve been doing all that stuff I described. You’re exhausted.And now how long has it been since you’ve eaten? Oh, wait, you’ve got pizza and soda on the table in front of you while you sit at your TV, right? Ha! Put it all away because by the end of the mission, you haven’t eaten in many hours, and the really fun part might still be ahead of you.And now, if you’re lucky, you’re a wuss of a USAF pilot like me and all you have to do is land on a nice long runway, then go to the Officers Club and eat.But if you’re a Naval Aviator, you’re about to face the biggest challenge—while you’re totally exhausted and hungry—by landing on a carrier. If the weather is bad? Too bad. You die if you don’t do it. If it’s at night? Too bad. You die if you don’t. If there’s also something wrong with your plane? Well, you get the point.Or do you? Can you really imagine dying after surviving four to eight hours of punishment during your game? And your life depends on you performing one of the most difficult tasks in all of aviation? I’m friends with the Naval Aviator who holds the record for the most night traps in an F-14. Great stories, cool guy, but he’s insane.That’s why I became a USAF pilot. I prefer a concrete runway, poured directly to the Good Earth, and dinner at the O Club.THE ENEMYAnd all the while you’re playing your game, there is no chance you will suddenly be killed instantly. And if you get shot down but don't die, you get to eject over enemy territory and perhaps spend years being tortured.I flew with many Vietnam POWs after they got back. I know too much about that experience!No video game can simulate having that possibility hanging over your head. One of thoseYOU’RE WELCOMESo, there’s an answer from someone who is not guessing, and I’ve given you some tools you can try to see how you’d hold up:SOME EXAGGERATIONObviously, I’m exaggerating some of this.

But according to the canon, Federation space comprises only about a fourth of the galaxy.In fact, this very question of Federation prowess is taken up by Q in The Next Generation episode “Q Who?” He chides Picard for brashly asserting that the Federation has essentially experienced and achieved enough and, consequently, is fully prepared for any exigency that awaits it in the unexplored regions of the galaxy. Q sets up Picard and the Enterprise crew - and, for that matter, the entire Federation - when he flings this Galaxy-class starship, the Federation's flagship, thousands of light-years into a region of the galaxy controlled by the Borg collective.The Borg are restless, soulless cultural and technological purloiners, having spent eons acquiring and sifting through countless civilizations, securing all of their assets, assimilating their organic lifeforms as drones in their collective. In terms of sci-fi aliens, the Borg represent one of the most brilliantly conceived alternative versions of hell - a frigid, living death, one in which lifeforms from other civilizations are captured, assimilated and consigned to an utterly sterile, meaningless existence, laboring on behalf of a collective in the cold vacuum of space.It turns out that Q rendered the Federation an immense favor flinging one of its frontline military assets into the deep reaches of the unexplored galaxy, ensuring that it would encounter this existential threat years in advance. He also managed to underscore to Picard and the rest of the Federation that their hubris was ill-founded and that in galactic terms they remained pikers.Q was right, of course: The Federation was capable of preparing only to a degree, basing threats on what it had encountered in the parts of the galaxy it had explored. Conceivably, artificial intelligence, which presumably will be highly advanced by Picard's time, will have sifted through huge bodies of data to anticipate the existence and nature of black swans - things that had not been encountered but conceivably could. Of course, the possibility, if not likelihood, of black swans was the very crux of Q's argument.As Q intimated to Picard before the encounter with the Borg, the Federation was approaching an inflection point: entrance into a part of the galaxy that offered inconceivable opportunities as well as risks, even existential ones.The Federation had better be fully prepared.",0 followers,Ethan Wells,534,2.6K,9.5M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Why-are-towed-anti-tank-guns-not-made-anymore-They-are-cheap-easier-to-hide-than-tanks-and-can-fire-sabot-shells-which-are-resistant-to-the-APS-hard-kill-systems-and-ERA-that-defeat-HEAT-warheads-on-anti-tank-missiles

Just like how it only implemented Photonic torpedos during season 2/3. It was at launch the most advanced ship in the fleet, problem is the fleet wasn’t very advanced at that time.Or this one?The Constitution class, NCC-1701 (no bloody A,B,C or D). This ship was a beast at launch, designed to fight the strongest known enemy vessel at the time the Klingon D7 battlecruiser. From all evidence the ships were pretty well matched with maybe a slight lean towards the Constitution class wessel. Now it did encounter more powerful ships but it also received multiple refits that greatly increased its capability, it was only ever really tested by either tactical brilliance from their opponent or by a larger somewhat godlike ship such as V’ger. Even when it went up against a new threat such as the Romulan warbird which came with a never before seen cloaking device and plasma torpedo the Enterprise still dominated it rather easily I might add if it hadn’t been for the cloaking device aswell. By the time of its destruction it was still 40 years old and it could give any ship a run for its money.Or this beast (yes I missed the A, it’s pretty much the same ship)Enterprise B. Ok we don’t know much about the history of the B, but we know a fair amount about the Excelsior class in general. These ships were built to be the next great leap after the constitution and taking in to account that no other nation had developed anything new this thing puts a generational gap between Starfleet and it’s opposition. As testimant to the power of the Excelsior class these things were in use 90 years after their introduction and were well used in conflicts from engagements at wolf 359 and throughout the Dominion war. After refit they could go toe to toe with a Defiant class vessel which was in itself very capable of carving a swath through Cardassian space. So yeah very formidable for and outside of its era.Next up.The Ambasador class Enterprise C.Okay so we don’t know much about this vessel, in fact all we do know is that it was taken down by atleast four Romulan warbirds in a battle that the Klingons decided was an honourable fight that proved to them that not only the Was the Federation honourable but that they were formidable. Says a lot about a ship in my mind. Apart from that we don’t know what or if there were any other battles by the C.The D.Ok so this is the first time when yes it probably did need a few more teeth to it, also less children and class rooms couldn’t hurt. But this ship was only supposed to be intimidating and even then the only real threat was the Cardassians. In engagements it is either vastly overpowered or pathetically outmatched, with the exception of Romulan warbirds which themselves were no small threat. She was again equipped with the best technology that Starfleet could muster, years of research, some of the greatest minds in Starfleet all helped build this fine vessel. The problem is she is not built for a fight, she has no armour plating, she’s slow and bulky, she is for all intents and purposes a bulky spongy target. However the D wasn’t supposed to be going to war, she had children and an aquarium for Christ sake. However later generations of the Galaxy class became beasts, probably when they striped the schools out and replaced them with extra phaser areas and hopefully Ablative hull armour. But a ship that could lead the charge against the Dominion is again a formidable ship, so this one was upgraded.As for this one:A ship that needs no introduction…. oh screw it I will anyway, this is the mighty E. The Federations Ferrari compared to a Klingon soap box derby racer. You see this thing you know that Starfleet wants a problem solved and quickly. These things were as well armed as most starbases, she came with 16 type Xii phaser arrays, 1 quantum torpedo launcher and 2 forward and 2 aft photon torpedo launchers, regenerative shields (you can see them working exceptionally well in Nemesis) and most likely ablative hull armour. This thing was a decisive instrument in destroying a Borg Cube and most likely could have beaten the Reman warbird scimitar if it couldn’t fire through its perfect cloak. The E was a beast, and got multiple refits even though they were not really needed.So for the most part, the Enterprises were well equipped for what they were going against, you couldn’t ask for more they were ships of there time.",0 followers,Harry Kim,612,157,313.7K,2018,https://www.quora.com/Why-are-towed-anti-tank-guns-not-made-anymore-They-are-cheap-easier-to-hide-than-tanks-and-can-fire-sabot-shells-which-are-resistant-to-the-APS-hard-kill-systems-and-ERA-that-defeat-HEAT-warheads-on-anti-tank-missiles

He probably also felt subconsciously a strong urge to prove to the Vulcans that humans were not violent savages going out into space armed to the teeth. Within a few weeks, the ship encountered a dangerous species that enjoyed attacking alien ships and harvesting the crew. The ship was badly outmatched and Archer had to concede that some weapons were necessary.Within two years, Earth was devastated by the Xindi attack, and Archer changed his mind even further, allowing massive weapons and shields upgrades and allowing military forces to integrate into the crew.A century later was the time of Kirk, and the attitude was quite different. The Enterprise was on the frontier, defending the borders of the Federation against a whole host of hostile aliens like the Gorn, Tholians, Klingons and Romulans. As Aaron stated, the Enterprise is shown to be well armed and shielded and is only defeated when heavily outnumbered or when fighting god-like aliens (Organians, Apollo, Trelane, Metrons).By the time of the Enterprise D, the situation was very different. The Khitomer Accords had given 20 years of peace with the Klingons. The Romulans had retreated into isolation for decades. The Cardassian and Tzenkethi wars were only border conflicts, not all out wars. Even so, the galaxy class starships were massive in size and heavily armed (multiple phaser banks and torpedo launchers and advanced shields). It did get ridiculous how often they took children into danger. As the series progressed, the situation changed. The Romulans were incited by the Borg attacks to return to galactic politics, the Klingons engaged in civil war and the Borg invaded the Federation.Even so, the Federation took years to respond. You can see that they did with the Enterprise E, very much a battle cruiser on the lines of the consitution class ships, rather than the scientific community model of the Galaxy class.","37,922 followers",Ron Rule,2.3K,2.7K,51.6M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Why-are-towed-anti-tank-guns-not-made-anymore-They-are-cheap-easier-to-hide-than-tanks-and-can-fire-sabot-shells-which-are-resistant-to-the-APS-hard-kill-systems-and-ERA-that-defeat-HEAT-warheads-on-anti-tank-missiles

And the Enterprise-D had phasers powerful enough to bore straight through a small planetoid and enough torpedoes to set off an ice age.It took extraordinary circumstances to bring these ships down - and in each case it wasn't because the ship’s weapons were insufficient, but rather that her defenses were non-functional. When you've got weaponry that powerful to contend with, taking even one direct hit without some kind of shielding to mitigate the blow can be catastrophic. And they took several such hits before being destroyed or disabled.Yes, most Enterprises seem to end up meeting their end in combat. But that kind of just comes with the territory. The name tends to be given to the most advanced ship in the fleet and is typically crewed by the elite of the elite. It's kind of a foregone conclusion with that combination that you're going to send that ship out on some of the most dangerous missions, and that anyone looking to strike a blow against Federation morale will make a point of trying to strike against it.","28,187 followers",Murphy Barrett,864,12.3K,157M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Why-are-towed-anti-tank-guns-not-made-anymore-They-are-cheap-easier-to-hide-than-tanks-and-can-fire-sabot-shells-which-are-resistant-to-the-APS-hard-kill-systems-and-ERA-that-defeat-HEAT-warheads-on-anti-tank-missiles

The Escort class, more commonly known as the “defiant” class, is the first boat made by starfleet expressly for killing.

The rest of the ENTIRE FLEET has at most 4 conventional phaser banks, three-4 torpedo launchers and THAT’S IT!Simply put, starfleet didn’t WANT to appear militaristic or aggressive, particularly when most of its boats can stomp their competition on the regular. As for the enterprise, it was destroyed a grand total of 30 times over a period of over 150 years, and that includes the 18 times it got blown up in a time Loop.

This interactive influence is becoming clearer as the vast extent of pre-colonial global trade and cultural migration is being properly understood by researchers. However, one finds a mainly Eurocentric perspective in the teaching of the history of science. Typically, it starts with Greece, neglecting the influences of others upon Greece. Then it 'fast forwards' many centuries into 1500 CE to claim modern science as an exclusively European triumph, neglecting the influence of others (especially India) on the European Renaissance and the Enlightenment. The European Dark Ages are presumed to be dark worldwide, when, in fact, other regions saw innovation and prosperity. In fact, Europe was at the peripheries, until the conquest of America in 1492.With the entrenchment of colonialism, the contribution made by others, including India, was ignored. The British colonizers could never accept that Indians were highly civilized as far back as the third millennium BCE when the British were still in a barbarian stage. Such acknowledgment would destroy Europe's intellectual premise for colonization – its civilizing mission. Early British scholars documented Indian thought and its external manifestations as systems competing with their own and thus facilitated the transfer of technology into what became known as Britain's Industrial Revolution. What was found valuable was quickly appropriated and its Indian manufacturers were forced out of business, often through draconian laws enacted by the British. This was, in many instances, justified as civilizing them. Meanwhile, a new history of India was fabricated to ensure that generations of mentally colonized people would believe in the inherent inferiority of their own traditional knowledge. This has been called Macaulayism, named after Thomas Macaulay, the civil servant who became the most prominent champion of such British cultural imperialism strategy starting in the 1830s.When it became difficult for Europeans to ignore the massive archaeological evidence of classical Indian science and technology, they asserted that the Indus-Sarasvati Civilization had to be a transplant from the Egyptian and Mesopotamian civilizations. These constructions in historiography have been cumulative rather than re-constructive: more theoretical layers are constructed to explain new contradictory data rather than prior ones being re-examined or corrected. Unfortunately, despite Indian independence there has not been much effort at correcting these distortions. Many among India's intellectual elite continue to promote the notion that pre-colonial India was feudalistic, pre-rational, and, by implication, in need of being invaded for its own benefit.This has created a climate in which entrenched prejudice against non-Western knowledge persists. Even after independence, an institutional bias against traditional technologies continues.It is important to note that among all the conquered and colonized civilizations of the Old World, India is unique in the following respect: its wealth was industrial and created by its workers' ingenuity and labor. In the case of the Native Americans, the plunder by the colonizers was mainly of land, gold and other natural assets. In the case of the Africans, the plunder was both of natural assets and of slave labor. But in India's case, the colonizers had a windfall – extraordinary profit margins from the control of India's exports, the taxation of its economic production, and eventually the transfer of its technology and production to the colonizer's home.This comprised an immense transfer of wealth out of India to Europe. From being the world's major exporting economy (along with China), India was reduced to an importer of goods; from being the source of much of the economic capital that funded Britain's Industrial Revolution, it became one of the biggest debtor nations; from its envied status as one of the wealthiest nations, it became a land synonymous with poverty; and from a nation with a large number of prestigious centers of higher education that attracted the cream of foreign students from Asia, it became the land with the highest number of illiterate persons. This remains a major untold story. The West has failed to recognize that its position of power was gained not by its inherent superiority but by the fact that it was successful in trampling over others.The justification for this gross exploitation and denigration of colonial victims was known as the civilizing mission. The colonial powers argued that in exchange for the wealth they plundered, both material and intellectual, they were providing the colonized people an opportunity to ‘modernize'. But, first, they had to create the perception that the West held all the keys to progress and that it was benevolently willing to share its gifts with the world. This perception was manufactured by Eurocentric historiographies and the manipulation, distortion, and concealing of historical data. In the Indian context, colonial Indologists were required to create a portrayal of India as a region that was backward and in need of colonial stewardship.After independence, many Indian intellectuals continued to use the pre-colonial, feudalistic framework of Indian society. In contrast, Arab scholars have brought out the important role of Islamic empires in the transmission of ideas into Europe. However, many discoveries and innovations of India, as acknowledged by the Arab translators themselves, are now often depicted as being of Arab origin, when in fact, the Arabs often retransmitted what they had learnt from India over to Europe.In the case of China, Joseph Needham, a leading scholar at Cambridge, made it his life's work to document China's history of science and technology in over 30 volumes. By the time he died at age 90, his works had transformed the study of China forever. The Needham Foundation has continued this monumental work, and has been expanding the series with new volumes. Today, every research library on China, and every major library on science and history, has the Needham collection as important reference. Every serious China scholar respects this work, and its impact on the perception of China has been phenomenal. This impact has also trickled down to depictions in schools and the general media.Unfortunately, India is yet to achieve this kind of intellectual repositioning. It continues to be depicted through “caste, cows and curry” images all too often. Indian culture is frequently portrayed as being mystical in the sense of being irrational, and in lacking a sense of advancement in the material plane of society. Often, many Westernized Indians internalize these colonial stereotypes. Amartya Sen expressed his views on this as follows:“Fear of elitism did not, happily, deter Joseph Needham from writing his authoritative account of the history of science and technology in China, and to dismiss that work as elitist history would be a serious neglect of China's past…“A similar history of India's science and technology has not yet been attempted, though many of the elements have been well discussed in particular studies. The absence of a general study like Needham's is influenced by an attitudinal dichotomy. On the one hand, those who take a rather spiritual – even perhaps a religious – view of India's history do not have a great interest in the analytical and scientific parts of India's past, except to use it as a piece of propaganda about India's greatness (as in the bloated account of what is imaginatively called ‘Vedic mathematics', missing the really creative period in Indian mathematics by many centuries). On the other hand, many who oppose religious and communal politics are particularly suspicious of what may even look like a ‘glorification' of India's past. The need for a work like Needham's has remained unmet (Sen, 1997: 32).”2. Competing globally requires intellectual decolonization:Facts contradict the following prevailing stereotypes:This should lead to the following introspection: Is India a 'developing' society, or is it a 'redeveloping' society? Were Indians always poor, always living in polluted and socially problematic conditions, and are these problems Indian essences? Or is there a history behind its present sociopolitical adversities? This history should not, however, excuse the failures of 50 years of independence to deal with the economic and social problems that persist.Indians need to overhaul their own assessment of their potential. Is India meant to be a nation dependent on importing technology and intellectual property, as we have been told for so long? Or is India meant to be a nation of exporters of technology and intellectual property, as Infinity Foundation believes?The implications are staggering. The choices are dramatic and opposite:China has embarked on a massive upgrade of its universities in order to export higher education to the third world. Its strategy is not driven by short-term economic income but by a long-term ambition to counter the West by spreading its own influence to the next generation of thinkers worldwide. These bold moves cannot come out of inferiority complexes, such as those that plague many educated Indians today.Until the 1800s, traditional knowledge generated large-scale economic productivity for Indians. It was the thriving Indian economy that attracted so many waves of invaders, culminating with the British. Traditionally, India was one of the richest regions in the world, and most Indians were neither 'backward' nor uneducated or poor. Some historians have recently begun to demonstrate that it was economic drainage, oppression, social re-engineering at the hands of colonizers that made millions of 'new poor' over the past few centuries. This explanation yields a radically different reading of the poverty in India today. Upon acknowledging India's traditional knowledge systems, one is forced to discard accounts of its history that essentialize its poverty and related social evils.Contemporary India's outsourcing industries and its ability to attract investments also depend on unstated, and often unconscious, impressions about India as a place to do business and about Indian culture. Since India sees itself as a global power, or at least a regional power, it must also embark on intellectually repositioning its brand – away from being seen as the center of human rights abuses, naked sadhus, exotica and erotica. There is no better place to start than via its long track record in science and technology.It is often said that Indians' recent excellent performance in the global economy – as medical doctors, information technologists, financial experts, corporate managers – must be the positive effect of colonialism. One hears even Indians internalize explanations of their success as being the result of colonizers teaching them “rational thought”, English, democracy, and so forth. An honest account of the history of ideas would make such Western chauvinism untenable. For example, one might raise the following objections:3.The rapidly-expanding, globalizing economy is built largely on Western lifestyles and is homogenizing human 'wants' in unachievable ways. Across the world, people are being forced to accept that progress, success and modernity are synonymous with Westernization. Those 'left behind' are made to feel like failures when measured against this standard. However, this promise of universal Westernization is simply unachievable. There are several reasons why:An example of the works detailing the history of traditional science (including from China and even Native Americans) is the SpringerSummary:It is, therefore, imperative that we study, preserve, and revive traditional knowledge systems. India's scientific heritage needs to be highlighted so as to replace Eurocentric historiography with an honest history of ideas. Especially for the Non resident Indians have an important role here. Every new immigrant group, be it in America or Europe has to define itself in the eyes of the public though a process of education about its history, culture, values and special strengthsIt is in everyone’s best interest that there should be a true globalization of the education system, in which all cultures’ contributions and merits are celebrated. This would build greater harmony, and would be consistent with the multicultural trajectory of USA. Just as Europe used Classical Greek thought to get out of their Dark Ages into Modernity, so also Indians could use their Classics to move forward. This would complement modern knowledge and not replace it.Indian Contributions to Science and Technology:The depth and breadth of Indian science and technology is staggering, and this section gives just a glimpse into the genius of India's scientists and engineers.Traditional Knowledge Systems:Modern Western technology has produced amazing achievements, but we must analyze the wider implications of such technologies and their notions of progress. These technologies often bring huge negative consequences that seem negligible in the short-term. We need to dispassionately investigate whether there are alternative technologies that offer more sustainable progress for all, rather than only the privileged.In search for such technologies, traditional knowledge or ‘local knowledge' provides a pointer. Traditional knowledge is the technical, social, organizational and cultural collective memory of human responses to the complexities of life, and is a part of the great human experiment of survival and development. Western criteria should not be the sole benchmark by which non-Western cultural knowledge is evaluated. While Western intellectual discourse has marginalized the term 'traditional' with the connotation of 'pre-modern' in the sense of 'primitive' or 'outdated', many of the traditional sciences and technologies were quite advanced by ‘modern' standards as well as better adapted to unique local conditions and needs than their later substitutes.These traditional folk and elite sciences are intertwined with their distinct ancient cultures and worldviews. Unfortunately, modernization has homogenized the categories, reducing diversity of worldviews in ways similar to the destruction of biodiversity. Using contrived hegemonic categories – such as science verses magic, technology verses superstitions, modern versus tradition – European colonizers systematically exterminated or undermined local traditional science, technology and crafts. Aside from intellectual arrogance, there was a profit motive to this – as evidenced by Britain's conquest of Indian textile and metallurgical know-how. Many anthropologists who have recently worked with so-called 'primitive' peoples have been surprised to learn of some of their highly evolved and sophisticated technologies. The term 'Traditional Knowledge System' was thus coined as a scientific system which has its own validity, as a supplement to 'modern' science.Hereafter some details on History of Indian Science and Technology are elaborated:Civil Engineering:From complex Harappan towns to Delhi's Qutub Minar, India's indigenous technologies were very sophisticated. They included the design and planning of water supply, traffic flow, natural air conditioning, complex stone work, and construction engineering.Most students learn about the ancient cities of the Middle East and China. How many have even a basic understanding of the world's oldest and most advanced civilization – the Harappan or Indus-Sarasvati Valley Civilization in India? The Indus-Sarasvati Civilization was the world's first to build planned towns with underground drainage, civil sanitation n, hydraulic engineering, and air-cooling architecture. While the other ancient civilizations of the world were small towns with one central complex, this civilization had the distinction of being spread across many towns, covering a region about half the size of Europe. Weights and linguistic symbols were standardized across this vast geography, for a period of over 1,000 years, from around 3,000 BCE to 1500 BCE. Oven-baked bricks were invented in India in approximately 4,000 BCE. Over 900 of the 1,500 known settlement sites discovered so far are in India.Since the Indus-Sarasvati script is yet to be decoded, it remains a mystery as to how these people could have achieved such high levels of sophistication and uniformity in a dispersed complex and with no visible signs of centralized power.For instance, all bricks in this civilization are of the ratio 1:2:4 regardless of their size, location or period of construction. There are many pioneering items of civil engineering, such as drainage systems for water (open and closed), irrigation systems, river dams, water storage tanks carved out of rock, moats, middle-class style homes with private bathrooms and drainage, and even a dockyard; there is evidence of stairs for multiple-storied buildings; many towns have separate citadels, upper and lower towns, and fortified sections; there are separate worker quarters near copper furnaces; granaries have ducts and platforms; and archeologists have found geometric compasses, linear scales made of ivory. Indians also pioneered many engineering tools for construction, surgery, warfare, etc. These included the hollow drill, the true saw, and the needle with the hole on its pointed end.Water Management:Given the importance of fresh water in India, it is no surprise that the technologies to manage water resources were highly advanced from Harappan times onwards. For example, in Gujarat, Chandragupta built the Sudarshan Lake in late 4th century BCE, and was later repaired in 150 BCE by his grandson. Bhopal's Raja Bhoj Lake, built in 1014-1053, is so massive that it shows up in satellite images. The Vijayanagar Empire built such a large lake in 14th– 15th century CE that it has more construction material than the Great Wall of China. What some historians call the “Persian Wheel” is actually pre-Mughal and indigenous to India.Scientists estimate there were 1.3 million man-made water lakes and ponds across India, some as large as 250 square miles. These are now being rediscovered using satellite imagery. These enabled rain water to be harvested and used for irrigation, drinking, etc. till the following year's rainfall.Textiles:Indian textiles have been legendary since ancient times. The Greeks and Romans extensively imported textiles from India. Roman archives record official complaints about massive cash drainage due to these imports from India.One of the earliest industries relocated from India to Britain was textiles and it became the first major success of the Industrial Revolution, with Britain replacing India as the world's leading textile exporter. What is suppressed in the discourse about India and Europe is the fact that the technology, designs and even raw cotton were initially imported from India while, in parallel, India's indigenous textile mills were outlawed by the British. India's textile manufacturers were de-licensed, even tortured in some cases, over-taxed and regulated, to 'civilize' them into virtual extinction. Textiles and steel were the mainstays of the British Industrial Revolution. Both had their origins in India. The Ahmedabad textile museum is a great resource for scholarly material.Iron and Steel:Iron is found in countries neighboring India, leading European scholars to assume that it came from outside India. Given the similarities between the Vedas and Avesta (a Zoroastrian text), some saw this as supporting the theory of diffusion of iron and Vedas into India from the outside. Refuting this, Vibha Tripathi finds that iron in India is much older. (See details in a subsequent chapter.) Cemeteries in present-day Baluchistan have iron objects. The earlier iron found in Middle Eastern archeological sites was essentially meteorite material sculptured as rock/stone carvings, and was not metallurgically processed at all. Since iron can be a by-product of copper technology, this could be its likely origin in India because copper was a well-known technology in many parts of ancient India. A smelting furnace dated 800 BCE is found in Naikund (Maharashtra), India. Recent discoveries reveal that iron was known in the Ganga valley in mid second millennium BCE. In the mid-first millennium BCE, the Indian wootz steel was very popular in Persian courts for making swords.Rust-free steel was an Indian invention, and remained an Indian skill for centuries. Delhi's famous iron pillar, dated 402 CE, is considered a metallurgical marvel and shows minimal signs of rust. The famous Damascus steel swords, now displayed in museums across Europe, were made from Indian steel imported by Europeans. The acclaimed Sheffield steel in UK was Indian crucible steel. The best brains of European science worked for decades to learn to reverse-engineer how Indians made crucible steel, and in this process, modern alloy design and physical metallurgy was developed in Europe. (For details see later chapters with book summaries.)Indian industry was dealt a death blow by the colonial masters who banned the production and manufacture of iron and steel at several places in India, fearing their use in making swords and other arms. In addition, they also ensured India would depend upon iron and steel imported from Europe.Zinc Metallurgy:Another important Indian contribution to metallurgy was in the isolation, distillation and use of zinc. From natural sources, zinc content in alloys such as brass can go no higher than 28 per cent. These primitive alloys with less than 28 per cent zinc were prevalent in many parts of the world before India. However, to increase the zinc content beyond this threshold, one must first separate the zinc into 100 per cent pure form and then mix the pure zinc back into an alloy. A major breakthrough in the history of metallurgy was India's discovery of zinc distillation whereby the metal was vaporized and then condensed back into pure metal.Brass in Taxashila has been dated from third century BCE to fifth century CE. A vase from Taxashila is of particular interest because of its 34.34 per cent zinc content and has been dated to the third century BCE (Marshall 1951: 567-568). Recently two brass bangles belonging to the Kushana period have been discovered from Senuwar (Uttar Pradesh, India). They are also made of metallic zinc as they have 35 per cent zinc content (Singh 2004: 594). Experts are unsure if this zinc was made by distillation process.There is evidence of zinc ore mining at Zawar in Rajasthan from the fifth century BCE, but unfortunately there is lack of evidence of regular production of metallic zinc until the eighth century CE. The earliest confirmed evidence of zinc smelting by distillation is dated back to 840Europeans learnt it for the first time in 1743, when know-how was transferred from India. Until then, India had been exporting pure zinc for centuries on an industrial scale. At archeological sites in Rajasthan, retorts used for the distillation are found in very large numbers even today.Once zinc had become separated into a pure metal, alloys could be made with the required zinc component to provide the required properties. For instance, strength and durability increase with higher zinc component. Also, copper alloys look like gold when the zinc component is higher than 28 per cent. Most early brass objects found in other countries had less than 10 per cent zinc component, and, therefore, these were not based on zinc distillation technology.Alloys that exceed 10 per cent zinc are found earliest in Taxashila in the fourth century BCE. However, while Taxashila was distilling and manufacturing zinc on a small scale, it was in Zawar, Rajasthan, where this first became industrialized on a large scale. Zinc mines have been found in Dariba (11th century BCE), Agucha (sixth century BCE) and Zawar (fifth century BCE). These mines have pots and other manufacturing tools of these dates, but the mining could be even older. (See further details in later chapters.)Three important items are now proven about the history of zinc metallurgy: (i) zinc distillation and metallurgical usage was pioneered in India; (ii) industrial scale production was pioneered in Rajasthan; (iii) England transferred the technology of zinc from India in 1736. British metallurgy documents do not mention zinc at all prior to this transfer.Shipping and Shipbuilding:Shipbuilding was one of India's major export industries until the British dismantled it and formally banned it. Medieval Arab sailors purchased their boats in India. The Portuguese also continued to get their boats from India and not Europe. Some of the world's largest and most sophisticated ships were built in India and China.The compass and other navigation tools were already in use in the Indian Ocean long before Europe. (“Few people know that an Indian naval pilot, named Kanha, was hired by Vasco da Gama to captain his ships and take him to India. Some of Europe's acclaimed “discoveries” in navigation were in fact appropriations of a well-established thriving trade system in the Indian Ocean. Contrary to European portrayals that Indians knew only coastal navigation, deep-sea shipping had existed in India as Indian ships had been sailing to islands such as the Andamans, Lakshdweep and Maldives around 2,000 years ago. Kautilya describes the times that are good and bad for seafaring. There is also extensive archival material on the Indian Ocean trade in Greek, Roman, and Southeast Asian sources.Forest Management:Many interesting findings have recently come out about the way forests and trees were managed by each village and how a careful method was applied to harvest medicines, firewood and building material in accordance with natural renewal rates. There is now a database being built of 'sacred groves' across India. Once again, it's a story of an economic asset falling into disuse and abuse because of the dismantling of local governance and disrespect for traditional systems.Furthermore, when scholars try to explain India's current ecological disasters, they seldom mention the large-scale logging of Indian timber by the British in order to fund the two world wars and various other industrial programs of the empire.Farming Techniques:Indian farmers developed non-chemical, eco-friendly pesticides and fertilizers that have modern applications. These traditional pesticides have been recently revived in India with excellent results, replacing Union Carbide's products in certain markets. Crop rotation and soil technology that has been passed down for thousands of years are traditional practices which India pioneered.Historically, India's agricultural production was large and sustained a huge population compared to other parts of the world. Surpluses were stored for use in a drought year. But the British turned this industry into a cash cow, exporting very large amounts of grain even during food shortages. This caused tens of millions of Indians to die of starvation in the 19th century.Traditional Medicine:Much re-legitimizing of traditional Indian medicine has already started, thanks in part to many Western labs and scientists. Many multinationals no longer denigrate traditional medicine and have in fact been trying to secure patents on Indian medicine without acknowledging the source. Traditional medicine is now a well-known and respected field.Mathematics:Prof. C.K Raju, a renowned scholar, has researched the “clash of epistemologies” that occurred in European ideas about numbers. When Europeans started to import Indian ideas about mathematics, what had been natural to Indian thinkers for a long time was very hard for Europeans to accept. He divides this into three periods:Additionally, Indians developed many important concepts including the base-ten decimal system, now in global use, and crucial trigonometry and algebra formulae. They made several astronomical discoveries. Diverse schools of logic and philosophy proliferated.Mathematical thought was intertwined with linguistics. India's Panini is acknowledged as the founder of linguistics, and his Sanskrit grammar is still the most complete and sophisticated of any language in the world.“Folk” Sciences:Besides the above examples of Indian contributions to the origins of the so-called “Western” science, there is another category of traditional knowledge called non-literate folk science. Western science as a whole has condemned and ignored anything that it did not either appropriate or develop, by branding it as magic and superstition. However, in countries such as India, which boast of cultural continuity, ancient traditions survive with a rich legacy of folk science.In North America and Australia, where original populations have been largely decimated, such continuity of folk tradition was disrupted. In Western nations with large colonies in the Old and New Worlds, such knowledge systems were looked down upon once they had been successfully plundered. The process of contrasting Western science with folk knowledge systems has led to the imposition of contrived hegemonic categories.The distinction between elite and folk science was non-existent in ancient times. India's advanced metallurgy and civil engineering was researched and practiced by artisan guilds. Western science seldom realized that non-literate folk science preserves the wisdom gained through millennia of experience and direct observation, and has been transmitted by word of mouth.For instance, modern scientists have humbly admitted that the ecological management practiced today by the tribes of India's Northeast is far superior to anything they could teach them. A good example is the use of alder (Alnus nepalensis), which has been cultivated in theThe vast majority of modern medicines patented by Western pharmaceutical firms are based on tropical plants. The most common method to select candidates for detailed testing has been for Western firms to scout tropical societies, seek out established “folk” remedies and subject these to testing by “Western science”. In many cases, patents owned by multinationals are largely for isolating the active ingredients in a lab and going through rigorous protocols of testing and patent filing. While this is an important and expensive task that deserves credit, these are seldom truly independent discoveries from scratch. Never has the society that has discovered them through centuries of empirical trial and error received any recognition, much less any share of royalty.Colin Scott writes: ""With the upsurge of multidisciplinary interest in 'traditional ecological knowledge', models explicitly held by indigenous people in areas as diverse as forestry, fisheries, and physical geography are being paid increasing attention by Western scientists, who have in some cases established extremely productive long-term dialogues with local experts. The idea that local experts are often better informed than their Western peers is at last receiving significant acknowledgment beyond the boundaries of anthropology.""Myths and legends sometimes represent the attempts of our ancestors to explain the scientific observations they made about the world around them and transmitted these to the future. They chose different models to interpret the observations, but the observations were empirical. Theorizing the possible role of myths, Scott writes: ""The complementarity of the literal and the figurative helps us to realize that the distinction between myth and science is not structural, but procedural ... Myths in a broader, paradigmatic sense are condensed expressions of root metaphors that reflect the genius of particular knowledge traditions ... Numerous studies have found that the ""anthropomorphic"" paradigms of egalitarian hunters and horticulturalists not only generate practical knowledge consistent with the insights of scientific ecology, but simultaneously cultivate an ethic of environmental responsibility that for western societies has proven elusive.""Despite these acknowledgments, in too many cases Western scholars reduce India's experts to “native informants” who are seen located below the glass ceiling: the pandit as native informant to the Western Sanskritist; the poor woman in Rajasthan as native informant to the Western feminist seeking to cure her of her native tradition; the herbal farmer as native informant to the Western pharmaceutical firm appropriating medicines for patents. Given their poverty in modern times, these 'native informants' dish out whatever the Western scholar expects to hear in order to fit his/her thesis, because in return they receive rewards. Rarely have Western scholars acknowledged India's knowledge bearers as equal partners. The obsession to make 'original' discoveries and to put one's name on publications has exacerbated the tendency to appropriate with one hand, while denigrating the source with other hand. This deserves to be called 'academic arson'.Relationship with Inner Sciences:India's inner sciences of mind and consciousness are simultaneously (a) being appropriated by the West and (b) being depicted as anti-progressive and irrational. In fact, inner and outer realms of inquiry are often viewed as opposites that can, at best, be balanced but not unified. This falsely assumes that the inner sciences make a person and society less productive, creative, and competitive in the outer realm. However, contradicting this, India's inner sciences and outer development coexisted in a mutually symbiotic relationship.A strong inner science will definitely strengthen the outer science since it is the inner world which provides the inspiration, creativity, and knowledge that is necessary in the development of a sound outer science. A strong outer science allows the freedom for the exploration of the inner science. Without the use of technology of some form, man will be forced to dwell in his lower nature to satisfy his basic needs of survival.The divorce of ‘religion' and science is a strictly Western construct due to the dogmatic and rigid nature of the Abrahamic religions. History-centric religions (such as Judaism, Christianity, and Islam) are often not compatible with the human tendency towards freedom of thought, intellectual originality, and non-conformity of thought which are necessary in scientific innovation. The tradition of spiritual experimentation in India, however, is compatible with the material and intellectual experimentation required by science.Many ancient Hindu-Buddhist inner science discoveries are being misappropriated and/or plagiarized:References:",UNKNOWN,Raziman T.V.,517,2.6K,24M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Why-are-towed-anti-tank-guns-not-made-anymore-They-are-cheap-easier-to-hide-than-tanks-and-can-fire-sabot-shells-which-are-resistant-to-the-APS-hard-kill-systems-and-ERA-that-defeat-HEAT-warheads-on-anti-tank-missiles
