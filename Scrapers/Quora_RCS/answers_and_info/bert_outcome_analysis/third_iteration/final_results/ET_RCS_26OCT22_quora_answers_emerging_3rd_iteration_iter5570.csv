This is in addition to the red stop button on the motor control panel.Moreover, because engine lathes are driven through reduction gearing, cutting current to the motor rapidly stops the rotation of the workpiece.My metal lathe is driven by a variable speed DC motor. However, if the lathe (metal or wood) were instead powered by an alternating current motor, there is another method to quickly bring it to a stop, an electronic safety device for AC motors called a Short Stop.This is made by the company Ambi Tech. The Short Stop is an electronic motor brake that stops the inertia of a running machine from allowing the machine to continue spinning after the current to the motor has been shut off.The Short Stop works by momentarily injecting DC current into the windings of an AC motor when the STOP button is pushed. This has the effect of turning the AC motor into a DC brake. This QUICKLY stops the turning of the motor and anything connected to it.I have an AmbiTech Short Stop motor control on my Powermatic 26 shaper.The intensity of the braking induced by the Short Stop is adjustable. This is necessary as too rapid a braking action on a machine that has a heavy cutter head attached to the spindle by a nut can actually cause the fastening nut to unscrew.Note that each of these safety devices only stops the motor AFTER someone has pushed the STOP switch. This differs from the stopping device on a SawStop which drops a sacrificial block of lead into the teeth of the saw blade stopping it (and destroying the lead bloc and usually ruining the saw blade) when the device senses the slight electrical contact of a finger with the saw blade.The SawStop technology could not be used with either a metal or wood lathe as there is in operation of either continual contact between the workpiece and the cutting tool and the operator.","358,973 followers",Sean Kernan,9.1K,5.6K,727M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Is-there-a-safety-emergency-stop-technology-like-SawStop-for-lathes
1,"Manual ones, yes, but not automatic ones.Why not? Because the SawStop uses technology to detect metal or live tissue touching the blade. Lathe work involves touching a metal cutter to the workpiece, and often fingers holding conductive steel wool or fingers holding sandpaper to the workpiece.if you were rubbing salad bowl oil onto that nice bowl you just turned, the stop would activate with each tManual ones, yes, but not automatic ones.Why not?

2,"Companies generally only try new stuff if they have to. Large companies with projects involving hundreds of people suffer from what I call “functional lock-in”, where a chain of activities requires hand-off of a particular kind, and a change to one stage of the chain can’t be made without affecting the rest of the chain, so it becomes impossible to change how things get done without major re-organization.New companies without the baggage of locked-in personnel get to try new things.",18 followers,Asim Qureshi,12.7K,996,156M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Is-there-a-safety-emergency-stop-technology-like-SawStop-for-lathes
3,The companies that last test emerging technologies. Very large companies from all industries are testing and currently using blockchain. Blockchain is a new emerging technology which is proving to have many use casesCompanies that adapt fast often last. An example would be banks that adapt blockchain early will be able to drastically lower fees and banks that do not will be hurt by this.,0 followers,Lucas Martin,6.4K,65,4.2M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Is-there-a-safety-emergency-stop-technology-like-SawStop-for-lathes
