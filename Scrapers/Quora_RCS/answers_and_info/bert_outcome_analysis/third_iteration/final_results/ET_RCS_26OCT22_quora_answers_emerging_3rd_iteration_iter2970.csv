4,"5 Forms of AnimationThere are many different types of animation but most of them fall into five major categories. There are advantages and disadvantages to each of them depending on how the artist prefers to create. Knowing the different kinds of animation can help artists to choose their careers in animation.1. Traditional AnimationTraditional animation can also be referred to as cell animation. This type of animation requires the animator to draw every single frame by hand to create an animated scene. This is usually done5 Forms of AnimationThere are many different types of animation but most of them fall into five major categories. There are advantages and disadvantages to each of them depending on how the artist prefers to create. Knowing the different kinds of animation can help artists to choose their careers in animation.1. Traditional AnimationTraditional animation can also be referred to as cell animation. This type of animation requires the animator to draw every single frame by hand to create an animated scene. This is usually done on a light table that allows the artists to see the previous drawing through the top layer of paper. Well-known companies like Disney are known for using this type of animation. Traditional animation is still done today on computers with special tablets.2. 2D Animation2D animation refers to vector-based animations similar to the ones used in Flash. This style of animation has been growing in popularity because the technology is so accessible. Although artists have the option of editing frame by frame, vector-based animation gives the artist the option to create rigs for the characters and move single body parts at a time rather than constantly redrawing the characters. It gives more flexibility to beginners in animation because they don’t have to rely so heavily on drawing skills.3. 3D Animation3D animation is also known as computer animation and it is currently the most commonly used form of animation. The process of 3D animation is very different from the traditional style but they both require the artist to share the same principles of movement and composition in animation. 3D animation has less to do with drawing and more to do with moving a character in a program. The4. Motion GraphicsUnlike the previously mentioned types of animation, motion graphics are not driven by characters or storylines. This art form focuses on the ability to move graphic elements, shapes, and text. This process is commonly used for things like television promotions, explainer videos, and animated logos. The skillset necessary for the other types of animation doesn’t apply to motion graphics because there’s no need to mimic body movement or facial expressions. Advertisements rely heavily on motion graphics and present plenty of career opportunities.5. Stop MotionStop motion animation is very similar to traditional animation because it combines a series of still images that are slightly different to show movement. The largest difference is that stop motion uses photography and captures real objects. With stop motion, the artists take a photo of an object or scene and slightly moves the objects before taking another photo. The artist repeats this process until the scene is completed and uses each photo as a frame in the animation. It’s similar to a flipbook with photos.Related Resource:Stop motion animation is organic and naturally appealing but it’s labor-intensive and can take a very long time and skill to execute. Traditional animation can be a great option for artists that want to have complete creative freedom but it also requires a very high skill level and it’s quickly being replaced by 3D animation. No matter which type of animation, the artist must consider the advantages and disadvantages of each to choose the one that best suits them.Upvote and share 😊👍",3 followers,Mark Bradford,12.8K,579,2.5M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-kinds-of-animation-can-exist-in-this-world-with-advanced-technology-with-high-possibilities

I told my friend about it the next day and apparently a few people have had similar experiences in that room.When my daughter was a little girl she had a pet guinea pig. Like people, guinea pigs don’t make their own vitamin C; they have to ingest vitamin C. And like people, if they don’t, they get scurvy. I had not known this - apparently a lot of guinea pig owners don’t know this - and was feeding the guinea pig food for guinea pigs that I would buy at Pet Smart. Guinea pig owners, if you didn’t know about this, save everyone a lot of suffering - especially the guinea pig - and feed them some orange a few times a week. Our sweet little guy developed scurvy and had to be put to sleep. My daughter was 9 at the time and was absolutely devastated. For about two weeks thereafter, we would hear him moving around in his cage. Except not only was the guinea pig dead, but I threw the cage away when we got back from the vet after having the guinea pig euthanized so that my daughter didn’t get upset when she saw it. Everyone in the family heard him.

These lions exhibited behaviors unusual for lions. They were man-eaters with a body count somewhere between 35 and 135 humans. This is unusal for lions. Lions are generally leery of humans, especially sizeable groups of humans. These were a pair of male lions that hunted as a team. This is also unusual behavior among lions. You’ve seen the nature specials; the male hunts alone, but mostly sits on his ass as his female entourage, or pride, do the heavy lifting. Depending on the account you want to believe, these animals also hunted for sport, something never seen in lions and rarely if ever in the animal kingdom. A recent study suggests that the human remains of 35 victims ended up as food for the lions, but a hunt total of 135 was reported. Was the 135 an exaggeration, or did the lions kill and drag off an even 100 humans for some reason other than to consume them? An additional “hunting for sport” argument can be made for the space of the confirmed attacks.

This means that if we have to rise up and overthrow our own government (currently seems like a good plan) then we will be armed with nothing more than some particularly well sharpened sarcasm.Still, perhaps one day we can hope to be as advanced as the US.

19,Well seeing as the US waited 2 years before it entered the war the UK had to play a bigger part.Post Pearl Harbour the US had to train and put into place the troops to combat both German and Japanese aggression.Roosevelt went against the general feeling of the USA to support the UK against Nazi Germany.In the Pacific theatres whilst the USA was Island hopping the Allies were fighting on the Asian mainland stopping the Japanese from taking Burma and India.In Europe the USA only came into real combat with the invasion of Sardinia and Italy.The primary combatants in Europe were the USSR and the EWell seeing as the US waited 2 years before it entered the war the UK had to play a bigger part.Post Pearl Harbour the US had to train and put into place the troops to combat both German and Japanese aggression.Roosevelt went against the general feeling of the USA to support the UK against Nazi Germany.In the Pacific theatres whilst the USA was Island hopping the Allies were fighting on the Asian mainland stopping the Japanese from taking Burma and India.In Europe the USA only came into real combat with the invasion of Sardinia and Italy.The primary combatants in Europe were the USSR and the Empire. The USA were really Johnny come lately.Could we have done without them probably. However it would have taken much longer.In the Pacific could the USA have succeeded without the Empire troops? No. If India had fallen the USA would have been screwed.So in answer to the question the UK played a much bigger part,0 followers,James Fennell,10.1K,356,4.2M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-kinds-of-animation-can-exist-in-this-world-with-advanced-technology-with-high-possibilities

Sometimes the Allies had the technological advantage, sometimes the Axis, and most of the times it didn't matter as the advantage was mostly temporary and so minuscule that your “advanced technology” had little practical effect.Nevertheless, I think that many here fail to appreciate what kind scientific giant WWI and WWII Germany really was.

Today English is the unchallenged lingua franca of science, but this was not always the case.Back then the dominant language was not English, but in many areas of natural science it was German. The most extreme example among these is probably chemistry. If you studied chemistry at the beginning of 20th century, then you also had to study German. Period. You could forget English, completely forget it. There was no way around it. Either you started learning German, or no chemistry at all.If we compare, for example, Germany and the USA in the number of awarded science Nobel prizes, then we can see that it took the USA 20 years, mass immigration of specialists, a lost world war for Germany, a complete breakdown of the German scientific sector, the division of the country, a gigantic German brain drain to achieve 1965 parity with Germany.Or based on more general terms, the use of language. The combined Anglosphere (USA, UK, Ireland, India, Canada, Australia) against the Germanosphere (Germany, Austria, Switzerland). We see that the shift occurred 1960 when the scientific output of the English-speaking world finally rivaled and eventually superseded the German share.",0 followers,Brent Cooper,874,7.9K,409.8M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-kinds-of-animation-can-exist-in-this-world-with-advanced-technology-with-high-possibilities
