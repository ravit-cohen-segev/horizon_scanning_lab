Smaller cities have buses available that will take you just about everywhere within the city and bigger cities have subways as well as buses. For going between cities and provinces, China has a high speed rail system in place that is more extensive than the American highway system! For example: I lived in a city called Nanjing in China - about 200 miles/300 km from Shanghai. I could take a high speed train from Nanjing to Shanghai in about 1.5 hours!In contrast, I took an Amtrak train from Detroit to Chicago (about 300 miles/480 km) and it took over 8 hours!Another area China wins at is public utilities. They provide electricity, water, and gas for billions of people for very affordable prices! I paid maybe a total of $20 (US) per month for all utility bills, whereas it cost me over $100 in America!

It is much more costly and difficult to set up a habitable research outpost because the outpost would have to provide fully enclosed, heated and shielded living environments. Those are necessarily going to be big and heavy and our only way to get them into space is probably going to be more elaborate versions of our current chemical rockets.The best analogy is the ISS, assembled in orbit over a decade. Apollo missions and the ISS demonstrated you can get a lot of mass into space if you have enough rockets and enough patience to do it.Sticking the landing is always the hard part. We are used to the idea of Earth re-entry where we let the air slow us down and then pop parachutes and land somewhat gently. That can't work on a planet that doesn't have a nice thick atmosphere like ours. Mars doesn't and most of the other interesting places have none at all. So getting something heavy on the ground in one piece is always going to be a challenge.We might come up with a smarter way, but for the foreseeable future  it would have to be the same as the moon landing, i.e. Using chemical rockets like smaller versions of the ones used to take off in the first place. That means much more fuel has to be carried and less payload can be carried.You define a colony as 100 people on Mars, 1,000 on Moon, 1 Each on other moons and planets. I disagree with your notion of ""colony"" in the sense that none of those places could ever be self sustaining (well, I guess never say never, but let's call it extraordinarily unlikely). So while you might succeed in landing that many people on those places, they would always require re-supply from Earth and hence could not be considered colonies. Just outposts in the same way the ISS is an outpost today.You ask ""I wonder if there are any PE firms that make 300 year plans?"" And again, that's easy. No there are none today and likely there won't be hundreds of years in the future. Private Equity focuses on a fairly short term (i.e. A few years) time horizon because their investors want to get paid. No private interest is going to make a multi-generational commitment with no profit at the end. There is nothing out there that would be worth overcoming the sheer physical difficulty of bringing it back.You ask ""How likely is traveling through wormholes?"". This is more speculative of course, since there is no evidence at all that wormholes exist. They are theoretical constructs, so there is some non-zero chance they might exist somewhere out there.
