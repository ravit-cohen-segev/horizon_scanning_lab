In terms of human faces, a fake person was shown with such glee. Look ma, I made my own person.Any one see the silliness? If this is what those brains do elsewhere, and we can dive into this deeply, then why would the ‘fake’ not be the attributes of DL? Almost by definition.Okay, people have rendered creative faces for eons. How much power and computer hardware was (is being) wasted on this stuff? Not to mention, brain power and the angst related to the silliness?Okay, to be positive. I’m on a trek to show the origins of the thinking behind things like convolution or tensors. You see, we are talking ‘algorithmic’ intelligence.As in, collect the proper elements and we get emergence. You all educated know that; biologists have been beating that into your brains since Darwin, actually before.Algorithmic? Give proper credence to the real player. Mathematics.Now, before knickers get twisted, we can show that Ma Nature knew all of this stuff prior to our cogitating. Oh yes, biologists, explain evolution? The types of thinking related to AI, complex systems (mathematics), about any top-down view (theory in science), religion (perhaps, it’s a choice, as are the others) deal with our ability to be intellectual, as in more mental than physical. So, we use our mentality to overlay upon nature, and ourselves thereby, models that have become increasingly complicated and somewhat useful.We were the sole players, until the computer came along. Like Chaitin noted, that made everything topsy-turvy. Lots to discuss. Later.Now, AI in its current vogue is computational. It does not have to be. AI, meaning what? Whatever we want to make of it. But, being’ness? Does not even come into play with the proper grasp being takenLet’s table sci fi when we deal with this, okay?So, let’s think convolution which has been aura’fied. We can go back to the 1700s. Oh yes, they were knocking off the heads of people in France when some of those thinking along this line were opening that can of worms. You see, it deals with a lot more than DL folks are admitting.So, mathematics? Let’s make it the focus of AI. Algorithms.Now, tensor. I mentioned this along with convolution. Einstein gave us the symbolics and grammar. The insights and the mathematics? Again, we can go back and look at the history of the development.We need to do this in order to break the psyche hold which leads to mania or angst. Thanks, marketers and gamers and sci fi writers and others who have contributed to the mess.There are other A’s in mathematics (and related disciplines) that could apply.—-Note: I just observed, again, an ongoing effort to drive some autonomous thingee. Its decisions were a little faster, but the whole of insights brought by Newton and later minds were not considered. In my mind, I compare this thingee (well known) with what a human driver would do. No comparison with respect to someone who would stoop to the job and learn the intuitive modes. After all, that is what we did to become adults. Wait, I am assuming that there are adults in the room (silly valley). I think that the thingee is a showcase. Yes, we are talking years now. A person would have been fired long ago. How many of these cases are there? I am one person and see this idiocy everywhere, especially those grammar ‘Nazis’ of a digital nature (NLP of the audio world) that are pure hell to this eighth-decade person.—-One astute manager, of late, wrote this: ML and DL ought to be considered an experiment with respect to their learning phase and engineering of such in their delivery. What have we? By gosh and by golly stuff that actually is harming people (silly folks out there in SF).—-BTW, in closure, mathematics now is this ego thingee with some aura of Olympia and its inhabitants (who were mythical). So, mathematicians, you want that as your aura? Strutting about. Especially with respect to what is known to be abstract nonsense. You know, you try to compute that and, in part, get the mess that we see of the little boy computer (even the huge ones, oh yes, they do numerics somewhat nicely - albeit, that is a problem to boot).In reality (and that is a big deal), mathematics is bottom-up where those uppers are supposed to rest in their grounding (where this does not mean any limitation to Mother Earth - note Ma Nature and Mother Earth are two different things albeit related). Weiner was sensing this.And, with this focus, we can improve ‘algorithmic’ intelligence by bringing the person back into the role that was evolution’s intent. What?Yes, underlying my framework for expression is knowledge that panpsychism (or something of that vogue) has the power to lift the fog (muddy cloud) so that we can be more truthful in our operations. It offers a whole new approach to a very proper (and age old) way of knowing (which is how mathematics comes to be in its humanly derived manner) better what Ma Nature is up to.It sure is not DL nor the current computationally framed illusions despite appearances otherwise.",UNKNOWN,Ben Y.

7,"Mithridatum- the lost art of poisoningA depiction of King Mithridates VI of Pontus.(Machiavelli praised his military genius.Mithradates VI of Pontus (120–63 BCE) was a powerfulMithridatum- the lost art of poisoningA depiction of King Mithridates VI of Pontus.(Machiavelli praised his military genius.Mithradates VI of Pontus (120–63 BCE) was a powerful king who challenged the late Republican Rome, creating an empire that stretched from the northern reaches of the Black Sea to Syria and Armenia.While loathed by Rome for his massacre of 80,000 Roman civilians in 88 BCE, Mithradates was hailed by Greeks and Persians as a “savior” from oppressive Roman misrule.Claiming descent from Alexander the Great and Darius of Persia, Mithridates would eventually take the title, “the Great” or Megas and would also be known as Eupator Dionysius.Hellenistic monarchs frequently used poison to alter the political landscape, whether to kill themselves or rivals.Poisoning was also relatively easy to get away with for millennia because possession of the murder weapon was by no means a clear indicator of guilt. Would-be poisoners could easily obtain the requisite materials from the shops of apothecaries or chemists, under the guise of using them in small doses for a cosmetic or medical purpose.Mithridates VI of Pontus: The Poison King of Pontus and Aggravation to RomeKing Mithradates VI had a good reason to become obsessed with poison. The previous ruler, king and his father, Mithridates V, had been assassinated by poison at aMithridates's mother, Laodice VI, held regency over Pontus until a male heir was of age.“He, however, being on his guard against such treachery, frequently took antidotes, and so fortified himself, by exquisite preventives, against their malice, that when he was an old man, and wished to die by poison, he was unable."" Justin,mithridates vi - Google SearchSupposedly during his youth he began to suspect plots against him at his mother's orders and was aware of her likely connection with his father's death.Living in times when slipping poison into food or drink was a reality that had been one of the choice methods of assassination for thousands of years, Mithradates VI began a rigid program to educate himself on every form of poison and that knowledge would later become his greatest enemy.While in the wild it is said that he began consuming non-lethal levels of poisons and mixing many into a remedy to make him immune to many poisons. The Roman natural historian Pliny the Elder called him, “with his brilliant intellect and wide interests … an especially diligent student of medicine, [who] collected detailed knowledge from all his subjects.”Scythians & CannabisMithradates VI fled into exile and returned in triumph to become a ruler of superb intelligence and fierce ambition. Sometime between 116 and 113 B.C., Mithridates VI returned to his home of Sinope and seized throne, having Laodice VI arrested and eventually executed.Once he secured the throne, Mithridates consulted physicians, scientists, and shamans in the hopes of creating a foolproof remedy to toxins.Inspiration forImage: folio 3v of the Vienna Dioscorides MS (produced around 500 CE). Clockwise from left: Apollonius (unclear which one); Krateus; Galen; Dioscorides; Nicander. Included on folio 3v but not pictured here: Andreas and Rufus (One ancient medical text,Rather than relying on court food tasters, Mithradates VI developed lethal poisons and then took small, self-administered, non-lethal doses to ensure that his immune system would be able to survive.The most famous of Mithridates’s potions was later namedThe Mithridatic antidote is composed of fifty-four ingredients, no two of them having the same weight, while of some is prescribed one sixtieth part of one denarius. Which of the gods, in the name of Truth, fixed these absurd proportions? No human brain could have been sharp enough. It is plainly a showy parade of the art, and a colossal boast of science."" (XXV.6-7)The original recipe for hisMithridatismMithridates took his concoction daily for decadesMap of the Kingdom of Pontus, Before the reign of Mithridates VI (dark purple), after his conquests (purple), his conquests in the first Mithridatic wars (pink) and Pontus' ally the Kingdom of Armenia (green). (In 88 BC, in a measure of the hatred felt for the Romans in Asia, Mithradates ""wrote secretly to all his satraps and city governors that on the thirtieth day thereafter they should set upon all Romans and Italians in their towns, and upon their wives and children and their freedmen of Italian birth, kill them and throw their bodies out unburied, and share their goods with King Mithridates"" (III.22). Tens of thousands were massacred: Valerius Maximus (XI.2.4) records 80,000 deaths, Plutarch (Mithradates’ wars against Rome lasted four decades, engulfing three continents. He survived at least two assassination attempts during his 57-year reign.In the end, Rome was victorious and King Mithradates VI lost his kingdom and his life, butAfter his defeat at the hands of Pompey, Mithridates VI fled to the lands north of the Black Sea in the winter of 66 BC in the hope that he could raise a new army and carry on the war through invading Italy by way of the Danube.In 63 B.C.E., when the Romans were about to capture him, he withdrew to the citadel in Panticapaeum, where he was surrounded by his enemies who sought to overthrow him.Pompey - WikipediaIn the end, ironically, it would be a representative of Rome, the champion Pompey Magnus, who would take the body of Mithridates VI, and bury him in the rock-cut tombs of his ancestors in Amasya, which had been the old capital of the kingdom of Pontus, and the heart of Mithridates VI Eupator Dionysius’ kingdom.""Mithridates had tried to make away with himself, and after first removing his wives and remaining children by poison, he had swallowed all that was left; yet neither by that means nor by the sword was he able to perish by his own hands. For the poison, although deadly, did not prevail over him, since he had inured his constitution to it, taking precautionary antidotes in large doses every day; and the force of the sword blow was lessened on account of the weakness of his hand, caused by his age and present misfortunes, and as a result of taking the poison, whatever it was. When, therefore, he failed to take his life through his own efforts and seemed to linger beyond the proper time, those whom he had sent against his son fell upon him and hastened his end with their swords and spears. Thus Mithridates, who had experienced the most varied and remarkable fortune, had not even an ordinary end to his life. For he desired to die, albeit unwillingly, and though eager to kill himself was unable to do so; but partly by poison and partly by the sword he was at once self-slain and murdered by his foes.""Cassius Dio (Florus, too, has Mithridates ending his life by the sword, one ""which he had in vain tried to destroy with poison"" (When Mithridates was defeated by Pompey, a notebook was found in the king's own hand with a prescription for an antidote which consisted of only two dried walnuts, two figs, and twenty leaves of rue pounded together with a pinch of salt (Poisoning was already becoming widespread in Rome by the end of the Republic. This made the Romans “very keen to acquire … [this] universal antidote.” They claimed to possess his original recipe and to improve upon it.For the next 2000 years, an antidote called “mithridatum” or “mithridatium” was included inIn Mithridates’s day, “poison” and “antidote” had somewhat different connotations than they do today. A “poison” commonly referred to an extract of plants containing alkaloids such as henbane (hyoscyamine), wolf’s bane (aconitine), or poison hemlock (coniine). Venoms of poisonous animals were also included. “Antidotes” were sweet-smelling lotions and potions believed to antagonize poisons. A “poison” could also develop inside a person without exposure to poisonous plants or animals. Thus, it was thought that “systemic poisons” were present in illnesses and these could be ameliorated by the same antidotes.CelsusA hundred years after the death of Mithridates, Celsus recorded the formulation, which comprised thirty-six ingredients, all of which are derived from plants, except for honey to mix them and castor to enhance the aroma.""But the most famous antidote is that of Mithridates, which that king is said to have taken daily and by it to have rendered his body safe against danger from poison. It contains costmary 1.66 grams, sweet flag 20 grams, hypericum, gum, -tears and parsley, 17 grams each, casia, saxifrage, darnel, long pepper, 20.66 grams each, storax 21 grams, castoreum, frankincense, hypocistis juice, myrrh and opopanax, 24 grams each, malabathrum leaves 24 grams, flower of round rush, turpentine-resin, galbanum, Cretan carrot seeds, 24.66 grams each, nard and opobalsam, 25 grams each, shepherd's purse 25 grams, rhubarb root 28 grams, saffron, ginger, cinnamon, 29 grams each. These are pounded and taken up in honey. Against poisoning, a piece the size of an almond is given in wine. In other affections an amount corresponding in size to an Egyptian bean is sufficient.""Celsus,Pliny (XXIX.24-25) was skeptical of theriacs such as Mithridatum, with their countless ingredients.""The Mithridatic antidote is composed of fifty-four ingredients, no two of them having the same weight, while of some is prescribed one sixtieth part of one denarius. Which of the gods, in the name of Truth, fixed these absurd proportions? No human brain could have been sharp enough. It is plainly a showy parade of the art, and a colossal boast of science.""And yet an examination of the pharmacology of Mithridates' original formulation shows a conscious effort to select plants thought to be useful, many of which have a strong scent and are from the familyEighteenth-century portrait by Georg Paul BuschGalen, physician to Marcus Aurelius, also created his own antidote, which he calledWhen it came to medicines, Romans held that more expensive and “exotic” ingredients were higher quality and more effective. (Plus, medicine-makers would earn more money selling a more expensive remedy). Physicians were well aware of the attraction that such an expensive drug could have on a wealthy clientele,.Mithridates Vi Eupator Stock ImagesWhile many have sought to unearth Mithridates’ cure-all potion, few have actually taken the time to doubt the veracity of Mithridates and the ancient authors’ assertions. What if Mithridates’ panacea was an elaborate ruse meant to persuade his enemies that all poisoning attempts were futile?It seems that Mithridates’ personal theriac must have either been inadequate or a hoax because he always kept a fatal helping of poison in his sword’s hilt in case he decided to kill himself.There are still other deficiencies in the Mithridatium myth. In order to build immunity against certain poisons, it has been asserted that Mithridates consumed small amounts of arsenic and possibly venoms, which may have been included in his chewable tablets, and while this could work in theory, the results would probably have been disastrous.Over the next few centuries, recipes for universal antidotes proliferated worldwide. In the eighth century, theriacs appeared in Islamic medical texts as poison-repellants and cure-alls. While some theriacs survived in European writingsThroughout the Renaissance and early industrial eras, major centers of trade from London to Cairo had flourishing antidote industries. Often, the jars the remedies came in were as expensive and ornate as what was inside them. Venice’s 60-ingredient theriac (dubbed “Venetian treacle” by the English) became the most famous, but pharmacies across the world popularized different versions.Theriac was perennially popular because it was thought to cure every ailment, no longer just poison.To make sure everyone was making medicines properly, doctors began to circulate pharmacopeias—manuals outlining official drug preparation.
