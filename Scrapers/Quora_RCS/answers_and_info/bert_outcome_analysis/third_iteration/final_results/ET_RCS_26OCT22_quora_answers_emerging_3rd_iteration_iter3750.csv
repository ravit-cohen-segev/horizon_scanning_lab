0,"You also have to remember that technology creates jobs too. Who maintains and programs that technology? Who builds that those machines? Who installs those machines? How about the buildings and factories? They need workers too. Because that technology is new, it takes skilled workers. Skilled workers are usually paid more than unskilled workers.If you don’t adapt to change, you’ll be left behind said the former buggy whip maker.","284,845 followers",James Altucher,17.9K,878,91.7M,2021,https://www.quora.com/How-can-todays-advanced-technology-be-called-a-great-thing-when-it-seems-to-just-take-jobs-away-from-people
1,"Jobs are not a right.Work is something you do when someone understands that you have a valuable skill.“Advanced technology” used to be cars, and stirrups and ATMs. Here we are.

2,"Jobs are modern-day slavery. We are paid just enough to live and not more. You are punished if you ask for more.We are often verbally abused on the job. Sometimes (more than is reported), physically abused, raped, castrated.The government gets up to 50% of your paycheck and then 10-20% of that goes to kill people on other parts of the planet, including our own children.We are deluded into thinking our job-friends are our real-friends. With our job friends we talk about pens and cubicles. We stop having real-friends.There's a glass ceiling. It doesn't matter if you are a woman or minority oJobs are modern-day slavery.

With our job friends we talk about pens and cubicles. We stop having real-friends.There's a glass ceiling. It doesn't matter if you are a woman or minority or a white man. The glass ceiling is that you aren't allowed to make more than your Master, even if he's an idiot.From 7am to 7pm you are either going to work, at work, or coming back from work. The times when you can be most creative are garbage-compacted into your cubicle.You eat shit at work. And, even worse, you have to shit next to your co-workers and Masters. Unless, like I have, you make a map of all the secret bathrooms in your local urban blight.When you are paranoid at a job, you are probably correct. THEY are, in fact, talking about you and backstabbing you right now.You realize that all the dollars you spent on degrees to get you a job that will make you happy were completely wasted. You were scammed but you can't let the next generation know so now you become part of perpetuating the scam.A trillion dollar marketing campaign forced you to buy a house you didn't really want and now you will ""lose a house"" you never really owned if you don't bow down to the Masters every day. The words ""The American Dream"" were coined by Fannie Mae in a marketing campaign 40 years ago to sell mortgages to slaves.Your spouse is tired of hearing about your job after six months. And you couldn't care less about hers. Ten years later you wake up next to a total stranger. 40 years later you die next to one.Your IRA was not intended to provide for your retirement. It was intended to take money from you every month so you remain chained to your cubicle. Inflation then takes 90% of your IRA.By definition: you create more value than you earn. That spread, minus executive salaries, is called ""profit"". This is not an ""-ism"". Just a definition.When you were a kid you liked to draw, and read, and run, and laugh, and play, and imagine a magical world. You're never going to do any of that again.Over time everyone is getting fired and being replaced by younger, cheaper, more temporary versions of you. You see this but are afraid to do anything about it.You see homeless people and think, ""there but for the grace of God go I"".Ok.Now. What are you going to do about it?",726 followers,Prashant Saikia,7.4K,349,1.3M,2013,https://www.quora.com/How-can-todays-advanced-technology-be-called-a-great-thing-when-it-seems-to-just-take-jobs-away-from-people

7,"Who ever said that we weren’t? This question reflects the huge gap between how the public views nanotechnology and scientists and engineers view nanotechnology. Nanotechnology is so effectively mainstream, no scientists even bothers to even mention that they are leveraging it anymore.The coronavirus was identified using the Oxford Nanopore sequencing technology with the MinION sequencer deployed in Wuhan.

Translate Bio is using a PEGylated nanoparticle. Inovio uses an electroporation based delivery system. BioNTech uses a RNA-lipoplex nanoparticle delivery system.Some of the other major vaccine players are using nanoparticle solutions. CanSino, Oxford University, and JnJ are using an adenovirus platform. VBI/National Research Council of Canada are using an enveloped virus-like particle vaccine candidate.

Three of the four worst hit nations in the first stage of the pandemic were US allies. The US President literally had a duty to get people to China and Italy and deal with the pandemic at the source and the press warn people about what could be coming to America and Europe.It wouldn’t even be a pandemic. It would just be a coronavirus epidemic.Everyone will be wearing masks. Social distancing will be adopted. People will protest social distancing. America will experience thousands of cases of this virus. Probably 35–50k cases of virus by now. Cities may still lock down. The US and China will still have a war of words.Trump wants to open up the country. Trump wants to let old people die. Trump wants to save the economy. Trump wants to end social distancing and start another rally.
