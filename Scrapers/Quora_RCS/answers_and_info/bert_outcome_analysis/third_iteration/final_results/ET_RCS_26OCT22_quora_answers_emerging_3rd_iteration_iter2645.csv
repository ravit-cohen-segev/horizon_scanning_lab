I’d feel aliens may be more inclined to respect this having likely felt similar or maybe even the same emotions on their home world to realsie what they’re doing is incredibly wrong and try to come to terms and reasoning between both worlds.The reason I think robots would pose a much larger threat is because we alone have a tendency for war and domination and it is possible for a robot of higher A.I intelligence say Synthetic to actually think for themselves or experience human emotions maybe even emotions we don’t even know of yet or have but never scientifically know of. Despite what movies say the exmaple is true and it is very common for the trainee or one being trained to overthrow and over come their masters. Also unlike axtual living beings like aliens and humans who’d likely not even adapt to the climate and billions of years of evolution without extreme scientifical and technological intervention on both sides of the seperate worlds robots do not need food, or water or to sleep per say or too drink, they wouldn’t even need to feel emotions if they didn’t want to, they’d be physically stronger than aliens or humans biologically speaking depending on their reinforced man-made substance, likely in a hypothetical sense eventually smarter than both due to the ability to high jack mainframes at will, colonies even our wolrd and other worlds etc, space threats wouldn’t show any significant health issues for robots because unlike actual born and bread living entities they’d have no rogans or cells per say like we or alines might. They would technically be living immortal beings of their own terrifying nature and over generations become so dominant who even wants to imagine what they could become able to do. Maybe even one day become so advanced as their own species sort of speak they no longer need to power themselves directly like we do tablets and mobile phones maybe even power thier bodies via solar energy or even cosmic energy.I only say robots because I’d honestly beleive over the milleniums they’d become inferior in wasy even science doesn’t understand yet and maybe it will be Quantum A.I beings that indeed take the fight to aliens.One things an absolute fact- Whether friend or foe or something in between the day we have superior intelligent A.I living amongst us just like in IRobot (and it really isn’t that very far away either in this century) is the day human beings need to consider if robots should in fact be given rights in the long term, how they should be treated and also are we now 2nd in the species spectrum of mental intelligence and if so do we have the right to enforce them and vice versa due to having not one but now two highly intelligent lifeforms on Earth.

3,"Aliens are popularly conceived, at least in science fiction, to be super intelligent but lacking in human sensibilities, ie essentially AI robots (as in 'the day the earth stood still') so what would the difference be? For myself, I'd prefer alien visitors to a man made autonomous quantum computer to which authority or agency had been tragically ceded. At least alien visitors would be sentient.

Effectively, it’s a job program for American military contractors. But it’s also a brilliant investment, since Israel, faced with constant threats, creates amazing technological innovations which improve on the American military systems, improvements which have already saved many American lives.We should also bear in mind that the amounts the United States spends to defend (often fair-weather) friends and allies, including the enormous costs involved in maintaining troops and bases overseas, dwarfs what the United States sends to Israel (and which is immediately sent back to the United States).There’s also a high degree of morality involved, since Israel - more than any other country with the possible exceptions of Canada and Great Britain - shares America’s core values and to leave Israel alone would be a dereliction of America’s basic values.","1,040 followers",Guy Schuchman,1.3K,495,2.3M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Would-you-rather-have-an-alien-invasion-or-advanced-technology-e-g-robots-taking-over-us

It still runs fine, especially when you consider the life expectancy of computers is only about 5 years. The core system is comparable to my laptop (a newer build of the same family) except it doesn't support 4k monitors. This 80″ television from Walmart replaces four 32″ monitors for less than the inflation adjusted price for a 26"" tv when I was a kid. The resolution on this monitor is so high you can see the pores on the actors faces from across the room when you watch a video. It generates almost no heat and no sounds other than those it is supposed to.A more concrete example: gas stations. In the 1970s there was a gas station with a full mechanics shop every 10 miles along any major highway. There was enough business to keep the mechanics employed and the pumps flowing. People who owned cars spent an hour or so every week tinkering under the hood. Today, those gas stations and mechanics shops are long gone because there was not enough business to support them. As automobiles improved over time, they became less repairable but needed fewer repairs. They became largely self tuning. They became more fuel efficient.

Consider the following. The base version of the F-16 costs an estimated 30 million dollars. Fully upgraded it can easily cost twice that. For this amount of money you want to get as much usage out of the machine as possible.Furthermore, there’s really not much you can do to improve on the design. The human body can only handle so many G forces before it dies. The F-16 is every bit as effective a weapon now as it was when it was first created, and barring a major paradigm shift in air combat, it will remain effective for the foreseeable future.Compare this to a Commodore personal computer from roughly the same time period. This machine is hopelessly outdated. It would have a hard time running a modern word processor, let alone anything I’d actually want to use a computer for. But the machine was only a couple hundred dollars, which is what it would cost me today to get one about a million times more powerful.To be more precise, if we look at transistor count, a computer from 1974 has roughly 10 million times fewer transistors than a computer made last year. Let that sink in.And the people who manufactured both devices knew this. Military engineers knew they were making big, expensive products that were going to be in service for decades, and which wouldn’t really need to be improved upon until there was another major war. And at that point there’s no telling what improvements would be required.Consumer products engineers knew they were making small, cheap, disposable products that the customer would probably throw away in under a decade, because by then an improved version would appear. They could make the device sturdier, but that would increase the cost to the consumer for a device they were going to throw away anyway.If a Commodore microcomputer was indestructible, you’d still have thrown it away by now because you don’t need it anymore. So why bother?Although, with careful use and regular maintenance, even old consumer products can last for decades. You just need to be really careful with them.","1,604 followers",Gilang Putranto,3.8K,185,9.3M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Would-you-rather-have-an-alien-invasion-or-advanced-technology-e-g-robots-taking-over-us

I bought a gaming laptop for $800 in the US that costs A$3,200 in Australia.Complaints about poorly-made American products are mostly limited to cars.Americans prioritise price, size, and engine power over everything else. European manufacturers, to keep their cars cheaper, end up putting cheap plastic interiors on their cars that they export to the US.Most Americans would pick a Toyota Camry over an Audi A4 because a Toyota Camry is cheaper.It is true that many new technological innovations in car manufacturing is in Europe and Japan—eco idle engines, rearview cameras, external sensors, the seatbelt, and so on.Most American car companies have not innovated very much since being early implementers of automatic transmission.

Just like any bodily institution on Earth, the US Armed Forces has its own budgeting problem.Usually, it’s a foreign policy problem though.See, the budget for the US military doesn’t just go to tech-development inside the country. It has to go to maintain their global military presence as well. Such case isn’t the case with Russia where they only have small overseas presence in countries such as Central African Republic and Syria.What’s more to add is head-to-head military confrontation between major power is a thing of the past and it will probably be nothing to be concerned of.Let me ask you something. When was the last time you saw Russian Mig-29 having a dogfight with American F-15 in real life? Pretty sure even if you do, it was a mock dogfight in an airshow.Why is that the case? Because a war between Russia and USA is a war that will never come. Thus making an arms race pointless.Like i said, it’s kind of useless to compare Russian and US military because it’s they’re the same on the surface only.The US who seek to be the dominant power on the global stage will always be ahead with its aircraft carrier fleet to which is in line with its gargantuan budget.On the other hand, Russia who has smaller money to spend always prefer to go with nuclear submarine which is while not as impressive, will still makes any foreign forces think twice before having a conflict with Russia.That’s all i can say for now.

As the Product Manager at the time I asked the NSA if they would stand behind us (and me as I might be personally liable) in court if we were discovered. Of course the answer from the NSA was “Hell no.”We were on our own.

The issue was never resolved but it should be known that our security source code HAD to be provided to the NSA in order to get FIPS certification and they made certain changes to it.So to answer your question, USA military technology is advanced far beyond anyone’s knowledge to describe the extent.On the other hand, the Chinese probably know more about our technology than we do since they perpetrated the greatest security breach in history by compromising the RSA key technology used by almost everyone in the world. We only learned of it through the vigilance of Lockheed-Martin who discovered the breach accidentally. But for months the Chinese had the key to almost every computer in the world.",26 followers,Balaji Viswanathan,17K,5.6K,427.1M,2017,https://www.quora.com/Why-does-the-US-give-Israel-so-much-foreign-aid-even-though-Israel-is-a-high-income-country-with-advanced-technology-and-services-sectors

23,"In which areas of advanced military technology is the US behind some other countries?Thank you for the A2A.This is an incredibly difficult question and almost impossible to answer accurately.First of all much of the cutting edge military technology tends to be secret to varying degrees. By technology we can think of things like “missile technology” or “rocket propulsion technology” etc.In which areas of advanced military technology is the US behind some other countries?Thank you for the A2A.This is an incredibly difficult question and almost impossible to answer accurately.First of all much of the cutting edge military technology tends to be secret to varying degrees. By technology we can think of things like “missile technology” or “rocket propulsion technology” etc.I will answer with what comes to my mind and I might miss some things and get others wrong but I’ll try.For instance we have air to air missiles. Europeans are currently developing Meteor missile which reached initial operating capability (IOC) less than a month ago.What is publicly known is that the missile has a ramjet propulsion system and can reach speeds of over 4 mach.According to MBDA, Meteor has three to six times the kinematic performance of current air-air missiles of its type. The key to Meteor's performance is a throttleable ducted rocket (Meteor (missile)Here’s an article claiming that Meteor is in fact the best air to air missile.The Best Air-to-Air Missile in the World Is in Sweden — War Is BoringAssuming this public information is correct and I don’t see why it wouldn’t be - Europeans are ahead of US at the moment with their air to air Meteor missile which was developed over concern for Russia’s R-77 Vympel ramjet missile and according to some sources Meteor missile was built to “wipe the table clear of all opposition”.M777 howitzer is actually designed by BAE (UK).It was immediately widely adopted by US Army and US Marine Corps as well as Canadian Army and Australian Army.The lighter weight and smaller size allows the M777 to be transported by theM777 howitzerAMOS mortar system is joint design by Sweden and Finland.AMOSWhen fitted to a vehicle, bothAMOSGotland class attack submarine originates from Sweden.It is said to be the world’s quietest submarine.TheOn the water surface, the submarine is powered by two sets ofThis capability had previously only been available withGotland-class submarineThe secret to the world’s most silent submarineArcher Artillery System is also from Sweden, it’s dubbed as the world’s fastest howitzer.It uses a Swedish howitzer system that has far superior performance against for instance the M109.The system is designed for high strategic, operational and tactical mobility. The vehicle can reach road-speeds of up to 70Archer Artillery SystemHaubits FH77And this one.. Leopard 2A6. I’m sorry, almost everyone I respect has the authority says it is superior to the beloved Abrams. It’s developed in Germany.It is said that it’s tungsten penetrators have superior accuracy and velocity and superior penetration capabilities due to tungsten’s higher melting point in comparison to depleted uranium.Leopard 2Prathamesh KulkarniIt is the world's fastest anti-shipThe missile travels at speeds ofThe land-launched and ship-launched versions are already in service, with the air and submarine-launched versions currently in the testing phase.An air-launched variant of BrahMos is planned which came out in 2012. ABrahMosThere may be more but I can’t come up with any at the moment, I may update this answer if I have the time and come up with or am recommended new systems and technologies.Things like Electronic Warfare systems etc. are hard to compare, they’re being developed around the world and especially Europe has a very competent high technology cluster that offers a serious rivalry to any US based companies while struggling with but a fraction of the funding that the US ones receive.Luckily for Americans and Europeans we’re all friends and we’ll sell each other anything we can make better than the other - provided they’ll want to buy it that is. Sometimes it is chosen to buy domestic just to support the industry.There are a lot of technologies and systems used by militaries andThey might already be immersed into countless engineering sites online and imagining whole new technologies and solutions.
