These are powerful armours that can give people additional strength to jump, run or lift heavy weights. And it is not just Iron man who can now do these things. Scientists have been able to invent such exoskeletons already, which can now be made available to general public, very soon. This is surely one of the most popular among additions to the 10 future technologies that already exist.3).Hover CarsHover cars have always been considered too futuristic. People believe that it’s impossible to have cars that can fly and we are happy with thinking of them as part of movies or documentaries. However, this is one of the 10 future technologies that already exist. Israeli scientists have been able to create unmanned battle vehicles for army evacuations.4)CloakingThe idea of invisibility is fascinating. As kids, we all wanted to imagine how it would feel to be invisible. However, we still thought it’s just restricted to realm of imagination. This is another one of the 10 future technologies that already exist. Cloaking devices are already a reality. Scientists in UK have been able to make a paper clip invisible by use of meta materials. This is another addition to the 10 future technologies that already exist.5).Hologram TVsThis would be one of the finest inventions till date.We are all amazed by hologram TVs that we see in Hollywood movies. We look at them in wonder and believe that they are something our grandchildren will enjoy. However, we need not despair. This is one of the 10 future technologies that already exist. Prototypes have already been made and the Japanese broadcaster will have a fully functional version out in 2017.6).Wireless PowerWe are all fed up with devices that need to be constantly charged with a real charger that we need to carry around. The inconvenience of this necessity has given rise to desire amongst people to see a wireless charger. People don’t think that this is available today. However, this is one of the ten future technologies that already exist.

6,"I think creative storage to level the load curve can be accomplished with minimal cost and allow PV and wind to be built larger than the daily peak load. I would like to see domestic hot water tanks adapted for thermal electrical storage based on local grid voltage and frequency stabilization. In a small city, 50k individual hot water tanks store about 2 million gallons of hot water. With a tempering valve on each tank, the temperature in the tank can be raised to near boiling and drop as much as 50 degrees with no inconvenience to the occupants (800 million BTUs of flexible invisible storageI think creative storage to level the load curve can be accomplished with minimal cost and allow PV and wind to be built larger than the daily peak load.

In a small city, 50k individual hot water tanks store about 2 million gallons of hot water. With a tempering valve on each tank, the temperature in the tank can be raised to near boiling and drop as much as 50 degrees with no inconvenience to the occupants (800 million BTUs of flexible invisible storage capacity - the equivalent of a quarter million kWh). With a fairly simple controller (and local hardware threshold controls) the heating of water can store the energy transparently. The heating of water could be delayed when the voltage or frequency sags, and could be heated to higher temperature whenever there is excess generation. Those controls could be done from central computers or just left to smart tank controllers. With each tank operating individually the neighborhood resolution of storage and line regulation would be very precise. Raising the tank temperatures would increase losses so the tanks should have high R-value insulation. When retired they should be replaced with larger and better insulated tanks (larger tanks have both more volume, and more volume per surface area to reduce losses). Thermal storage would not replace the need for battery and inverter storage but it could significantly reduce the amount required and allow it to be used only when additional generation capacity is needed. The tank’s low temperature thermostat would always control the “on” condition to prevent any disruption of hot water in the building, and the high temperature thermostat would always turn off the element if the temperature (or in some cases also pressure) exceed the safe limit.Other similar delayed use storage might include “powerwall” batteries, either alone or attached to PV systems. Another possibility is EV vehicle to grid management of storage. Storage is the key to increased load saturation by PV and wind. The storage needs to be cheap, and reliable, and I would add distributed widely in the service area.","51,703 followers",Chris Ebbert,906,11.4K,278.5M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-could-be-the-best-technologies-for-next-two-years

Therefore, the best tech is what the utilities are trying to deploy now: distribution circuit primary reclosers.A primary circuit with no reclosers is totally out for one mainline fault because the substation breaker locks open. One midpoint reclosers will allow the front half of the feeder to be restored in seconds if the fault is on the back half of the feeder.

That's a 50% reliability improvement.More reclosers reduce the portion of the feeder out by isolating the fault area even smaller.The rub is, an installed reclosers costs about $50k or more.The next rub is that most reclosers are ganged three phase operation. So, two unfaulted phases where there is a single phase fault remain out pending repair.An average feeder is about 5–20 miles of main line wire and feeds 1000–4000 customers. A feeder lockout, then, affects thousands of utility customers.In my opinion, and that's all it is, every primary feeder in existence needs 10 reclosers on average, but PUCs don't really push utilities on it because regulators don't really understand the logic behind the reclosers and, even if they do, they let the utilities choose how to spend reliability dollars. This just dilutes the money's effects. I guess PUCs would rather push things like solar.All you need to impel greater reliability is a PUC regulation that a utility needs to bring say 5 feeders per year up to this spec. Within 3 years, a step change improvement will be seen in the utility reliability statistics.To your question, in the near term, this is where the grid is or should be going. When a tipping point quantity of reclosers is reached on the system both interfeeder and intrafeeder, restoration switching steps can be given over to the computer. Great in a storm situation.

Or Openoffice has a switch that sets to (Excel97/2003 interface). Heck why not make Word2020 look like WordPerfect 5.1 should the user choose. It should be just a shell.-Let’s say I want to view CNN, BBC, or CBC base news site, there is a reader that presents different content from different providers in a common way, selected by the user.-Let’s say someone is accomplished in any number of computer languages and wants to script a task at the application level. why can’t they select a language of choice or even pseudeo-code or even mix and match snippets of a bunch of languages.Such a concept would be counter to many efforts to “improve” interfaces but it seems now a lot of effort isn’t to improve the interace but support the “clickbait” or “latest version” push of revenue models.I know this was a pipe dream that seemed to happen for a short time with HTML, W3C, and early windows/mac based application (think some linux people might be a ray of hope). With so many apps, IDE, and interfaces now it’s seems to be off the rails. We also had most of the 20th century where if one opened a book one expected a structure of table of contents, chapters, index etc.Given the current state of technology, if my 99 year old grandmother was comfortable and had reinforced behaviors that allowed her to function with skills in Windows 95, why should she have to learn new skills? Why can’t the salesperson upon deliver say “Siri, give this iPad a win95 look and feel” and the appropriate royalties be paid for at time of purchase.We are talking about the outside interface, not the internal guts. There is already a hardware abstraction layer between the software and firmware/hardware. Why can’t there be a Interface abstraction layer between the software and the WetWare ( namely the idiot-old-fart wondering where all my Excel menus went and why are these buttons taking up so much real estate on the damm screen) That way the teenager can use the voice/image capture gesture tech or whatever is the next interface and I can still expect to seeWhat I am saying is the next generation in detail hiding. Let computers be computers and let people be people. We’re getting there.Note: I was using “idiot-old-fart” term reflexively. :-)",UNKNOWN,Guy D.
