Even if fusion power generation is feasible, commercialization is a problem judging by the scale of the experimental reactors.Fusion power generation would be entering a market at the time when solar and wind power generation have reached full market penetration and have harvested significant economies of scale to be much cheaper than they are now.Fusion power will have the same cost disadvantage that fission power has now, but ten times worse.",UNKNOWN,Viktor T.

From having many long conversations with these very intelligent and qualified people I realized that thereI used to work on fusion simulation codes (particle in cell) with the US National Labs when I was at NVIDIA, and I was very interested in seeing if we could solve the problems with fusion and picked the scientist and engineers' brains endlessly. My former father-in-law also worked at Lawrence Berkeley Labs, and was an engineer designing superconducting coil magnets and had decades of experience working with fusion researchers, even though his primary application was particle accelerators. From having many long conversations with these very intelligent and qualified people I realized that there are some really hard problems that block practical fusion, with no immediate solutions in sight.The only place we know of working, large-scale, energy-generating fusion reactions is at the center of a star, where the gravity of the massive star creates the necessary density, temperature, and time being held in that state at the core for fusion reactions to run continuously. This is called the Lawson criteria, and is hard to achieve. All of the layers of the star above that act as an energy exchanger, converting all the gamma rays and fast neutrons at the core into progressively less energetic wavelengths of light and motion of nuclei (heat) so by the time they reach the surface of the star, that energy is emitted as IR and visible light that heats and powers our planet's biosphere, and can provide photovoltaic energy to us as well. All of our efforts in fusion have been to try and reproduce this process on earth, in a small reactor that can provide practical energy.First I will talk aboutThe first problem with magnetic confinement is fundamental - no matter how strong or well formed the magnetic field containing the plasma is, it will always leak, as positive nuclei or ions spiralling around the magnetic field lines collide and scatter, eventually drifting out of the containment field. The only known solution is to make the reactor larger so the scattering ions take longer to travel to the plasma boundary, and thus more fusion can happen during that time. Pretty brute force.The world's most advanced magnetic confinement fusion power plant is ITER, which, to reduce the ion scattering problem mentioned above, is 6-stories tall and about the same dimension in diameter, containing the mass of 3 Eiffel towers, and it is still not expected to be large enough to contain a plasma long enough to sustain burning and produce continuous energy generation.A more practical problem is how do we extract the energy? Most of the energy in deuterium-tritium fusion reactions is released in fast, high-energy neutrons, which (because they are neutral, and have no electric charge) are not confined by the magnetic field, don't heat up the plasma, and have to be stopped by a thick shield, which then heats up, and can vaporize water to steam in order to power turbines and electrical generators. The problem is the constant bombardment by neutrons makes the shield material degrade with time, and become very radioactive, posing a problem for removal and disposal.Also, deuterium-tritium fusion reactions are currently used because they take place at the lowest energies and at the lowest plasma temperatures of all the possible fusion fuels, and thus are easier to ignite and keep lit. However, tritium is not found naturally in any significant quantities and needs to be manufactured in nuclear reactors. With today's production capacity, we just cannot make enough tritium to power even ITER continuously. We could use better fuels, like Helium-3 or Boron-11, which do not emit neutrons and thus 'burn clean', but the plasma temperature must be much higher and the confinement much better to ignite fusion and sustain it with these fuels. And while Boron-11 is plentiful, Helium-3 is so rare that scientists think that the best source of it is lunar regolith that has been irradiated for billions of years on the moon's surface. Any energy generation infrastructure that requires a regular supply of a moon-based fuel, even as energy dense as He3, will probably never work out.A proposed solution to the Tritium deficit is to construct the shield surrounding the reactor with lithium, which is abundant, and fissions into tritium when struck by neutrons, thereby 'breeding' tritium within the reactor itself. Of course, this comes with its own set of problems of how to capture, purify, and contain the tritium after it is released into the tokamak reaction chamber from the walls.Another issue is that when all of the superconducting magnets in ITER are running at full current (160,000 amps) to create the 13 Tesla toroidal magnetic field (13x that in an MRI machine) and to create the other plasma-shaping and heating fields, they are storing 60 GigaJoules, or around 12 Tons of TNT worth of energy. This is because the 180 kilometers of superconducting Niobium-Tin wires in all these massive magnet coils can carry enormous electrical current when supercooled with liquid helium.More info on the ITER magnets:But, if that cooling fails, the superconductor heats up, quenches, and becomes a normal conductor, and can no longer carry that enormous current. With 160,000 amps suddenly meeting resistance, the coil rapidly vaporizes, and causes a meltdown of the other coils, with a total energy release of 12 tons of TNT. This is very undesirable, especially when those coils are wrapped around a highly radioactive shield that also vaporizes and is expelled into the atmosphere. There are fault-detection systems, but it takes a while to dissipate that amount of energy safely, and there may not be enough time to react quickly enough in the event of a catastrophic magnet coil failure.So, some gotchas left to solve for practical fusion energy generation with magnetic confinement, with some perhaps not so easily solved.Inertial confinement fusionIt also has many of the same problems with energy conversion to electricity, and much worse wear and tear on the shielding from these small nuclear fusion explosions being set off, which also trashes all the precision equipment needed to hold the fuel pellet in the focus of the converging laser beams with extreme accuracy. So, a lot of practical damage control problems before inertial confinement fusion is a practical source of energy generation.While these problems may be solved, practical application is still a very long way off, and currently the main application of inertial confinement fusion is as an experimental testbed for calibrating computer codes used to simulate and design thermonuclear fusion weapons. As horrific as these weapons may be, the simulation codes developed for designing them (sorry maintaining them), are the one of the greatest tools for innovation in fusion energy. There is a hydrodynamics code which simulates the behavior of the fissile (and fusion) materials under extreme conditions of pressure and temperature, as well as transport codes that model neutron transport and scattering in the materials under these conditions, and many other bits and bobs. They are all standard numerical techniques, and the really classified part is the integration and calibration of all these codes with previous nuclear weapon tests from the past, and with these small scale simulations in the present.Electrostatic Confinement FusionBasically you need a vacuum container the size of a basketball and a pump to empty it. You put a small spherical wire cage the size of a golf ball in the center, and a larger wire cage the size of a bowling ball around it. You then pump out all the air, and apply a very large (10,000V) electrical potential between the two cages, with the small negative cathode at the center, and the positive anode at the periphery.Then you open a valve and let in a very small amount of Deuterium gas (commercially available) into the vacuum chamber, and it ionizes in the large voltage potential, the D+ ions in the periphery experience a very strong electric field (100K V/m), and are rapidly accelerated towards the center of the reactor, with enough energy to collide and fuse the deuterium nuclei (no tritium required). This fusion can be measured with an external neutron counter.Theoretically, power generation would be simple, as the fusion products consisting of highly energetic He3 and (few) H3 ions could be decelerated in an electric field and the current from that used to generate electricity directly.Here is ECG Herman’s excellent thesis paper on designing and constructing a Farnsworth Fusor:Although they seem like a obvious winners due to their simplicity and effectiveness, ECF reactors have several things limiting scaling:a) There is a limit to the deuterium gas density before performance degrades, so generation capacity is limited.b) Deuterium ions tend to collide with the wire cage cathode in the center, which absorbs them, heating the cage, and causing energy loss and contamination from metal atoms being dislodged.c) As the deuterium ions oscillate back and forth through the center, each time they change direction, they emit bremsstrahlung radiation, or photons of light, losing energy (this is how your dentist’s x-ray machine works).d) Scattering tends to reduce the nice, radial trajectories of the ions into a Maxwellian distribution over time, reducing the fusion that occurs.There has been work in using electromagnets at the periphery to try and hold a ball of electrons in the center, eliminating the need for a central cage… akaThermonuclear WeaponsIn the Teller-Ulam, two-stage, thermonuclear weapon, a spherical plutonium fission primary (with deuterium-tritium fusion fuel at the core to boost it) is imploded by conventional explosives, the plutonium is crushed far beyond critical density, fissions and detonates. The initial radiation released is contained and focused onto the fusion secondary to implode it, ignite fusion, and detonate it. I just mention this to illustrate the enormous energy needed to really reach the Lawson criteria in a large scale, but nuclear weapons kind of freak me out, so I'm going to refer you to the link to the Wikipedia article about them if you want to read more:Thermonuclear weapon - WikipediaSo, in summary, we should not shut down or stop building today's fission nuclear reactors, as commercial fusion reactors are not only far in the future, but also produce radioactive waste (their shielding, which needs to be periodically replaced), and Tokamaks can melt down catastrophically and explode if there is a cooling failure in the magnet coils during full power operation. They also do not run on seawater, like some say. We need expensive and difficult to produce tritium (which is also radioactive) to ignite fusion at the temperatures and densities that today's tokamak magnetic fields can produce.To advance fusion energy in your career, I think the best fields to study would be physics (classical, electrodynamics, plasma, quantum, nuclear…) and computer science, with a focus on numerical simulation. The actual physical fusion reactors are so expensive and time-consuming to build, test, and operate, that you may only get to iterate designs once or twice in a career, but computer simulations can take us in so many different directions more cheaply and easily by comparison.Perhaps there is some exotic stellarator magnetic confinement design, or advanced Farnsworth electrostatic confinement design that has not been explored in depth, that will turn out to hold the key to fusion energy. Simulation is probably the best first step to find it, unless you have a few billion dollars and several hundred kilometers of Niobium-Tin wire and helium cooling tubing to play with.Brent",341 followers,Payam Adlparvar,820,530,2.5M,2021,https://www.quora.com/How-should-India-work-on-harnessing-fusion-power-and-turning-it-into-the-next-energy-frontier

7,"Cutting off the fuel supply.Inside a tokamak fusion reactorIn a fission reactor, the fuel (enriched uranium, usually) sits in the reactor, spitting out thermal neutrons at just the right energy to split uranium atoms, making more neutrons, and so on, in what is known as a chain reaction.Getting the fuel to spit out just enough neutrons to stay hot so that useful energy can be gotten from the reactor, but not so hot that things start to melt that shouldn’t melt is a tricky engineering problem, and is an exercise in careful management of moderators, working fluid, fuel, and temperature control.Cutting off the fuel supply.Inside a tokamak fusion reactorIn a fission reactor, the fuel (enriched uranium, usually) sits in the reactor, spitting out thermal neutrons at just the right energy to split uranium atoms, making more neutrons, and so on, in what is known as a chain reaction.Getting the fuel to spit out just enough neutrons to stay hot so that useful energy can be gotten from the reactor, but not so hot that things start to melt that shouldn’t melt is a tricky engineering problem, and is an exercise in careful management of moderators, working fluid, fuel, and temperature control. Sometimes something breaks, and the balancing act is knocked off its balance. If you’re lucky, the thing that breaks makes fewer neutrons so it cools down, and you’ve no worries except some downtime, an expensive repair bill, and the cost of restarting the reactor.If you’re unlucky, the thing that breaks leads to more neutrons being made, which makes things hotter, which means that more things break, which leads to things getting hotter, and so on. If you’reFor example, at Fukushima Daiichi, the 2011 tsunami flooded the reactor buildings. Reactors 4, 5, and 6 were shut down for maintenance, so they were okay. The remaining reactors were automatically shut down when the earthquake causing the tsunami hit. But great lumps of uranium take time to cool down from their operating temperatures, and require active cooling measures to do so, being well insulated to prevent energy loss during normal operation.The emergency generators powering the cooling systems were disabled by the flooding, so the cores got hotter, leading to them melting. In two of the reactor buildings, the general disarray lead to hydrogen gas being generated from the water in the reactor over the next few days, which exploded, wrecking the buildings.Note that these explosions were notIn a thermonuclear or fusion reactor, deuterium and tritium are compressed in magnetic fields at high temperature until they fuse, making helium and a neutron. The neutron flies free of the reaction and is captured by lithium cladding to produce heat and more tritium. In a commercial reactor, when we have those, the heat will drive steam turbines, just like a fission reactor. The cladding is processed to extract the tritium to be used as fuel later. The helium is drawn off, and more deuterium and tritium fuel is added to keep the reaction going.Note that, unlike the fission reactor, this isAnother failure state might be if the plasma becomes dynamically unstable and collides with the walls of the vacuum chamber. This will probably cause some damage to the cladding and magnets, collapsing the magnetic field and necessitating some expensive repairs. It is unlikely to cause a breach of the reactor; the plasma only contains a few grams of fuel at any one time.If by some combination of bad design and mismanagement the reactor chamber was breached, again this would be a purely mechanical failure. There might be something you could call an explosion as the high-pressure, high temperature plasma escapes into the atmosphere, but it would be stretching it to call it aEven if you could somehow arrange forSo, a fusion reactor big enough to threaten the world isn’t really a thing*, and if it was, you’d only have to cut off the fuel.*Except for the obvious:But how to stop the Sun destroying the planet is another question.",UNKNOWN,Viktor T.

Carbon Detonation Fusion permanently converts Carbon to energy and alternative elements (like non-radioactive Helium, Neon, and Oxygen gas) that do not produce any green house effect.Because during Carbon Detonation Fusion the temperature increases from the fusion, but volume is controlled by degenerate electrons and thus does not increase, plasma pressure and thus the rate of the fusion reaction can increase greatly - producing fusion's closest equivalent to fission's runaway chain reaction.By carefully controlling the amount of fusion fuel (carbon) used per shot, safe controlled bursts of fusion energy can be produced.The fusion carbon-burning process or carbon detonation fusion includes the following set of nuclear fusion reactions.The principal simple carbon burning fusion reactions are believed to be:6C12 + 6C-12 -> 10Ne-20 + 2He-4 + 4.617 MeV6C12 + 6C-12 -> 11Na-23 + 1H-1+ 2.241 MeV6C12 + 6C-12 -> 12Mg-23 + neutron – 2.599 MeV6C12 + 6C-12 -> 12Mg-24 + γ + 13.933 MeV6C12 + 6C-12 -> 8O-16 + 2He-4 + -0.113 MeVCarbon Detonation Fusion requires high temperatures (> 5×10^8 K or 50 keV) and high densities (> 3×10^9 kg/m3).It remains uncertain whether a Carbon Detonation Fusion will ever be used to produce controlled amounts of energy on earth.As plasma pressure increases, both the power that can be generated from a given fusion plasma and the rate of the fusion reaction in the plasma are greatly accelerated.LLNL researchers have recently demonstrated that they can achieve a pressure on a small solid sample of 5 terapascals (equivalent to 50 million atmospheres).
