0,An extra-thick bone structure on the forehead. This will help future humans better survive the impact with lamp posts as they walk along focused on their smart devices.Loss of vocalisation ability. Replaced by said smart devices and chat apps.Reduced brain size. This will reduce energy consumption and allow us to more easily survive on junk food.Mind over matter ability as we further refine our belief that what we want to be true is actually true.,"220,617 followers",Franklin Veaux,1.8K,47.3K,782.9M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Which-new-traits-are-humans-likely-to-evolve-due-to-the-incorporation-of-technology-in-our-lives

2,I think in the future Homo Sapiens will change based off of our environment. Looking into cell phones will impact our eyes.

4,"Technology seems to replace the need for biological changes. Still, I think if tech has any obvious effect on our evolution, it will be more about the ability to multitask and do several things at once.Sex is sometimes an arms race. In some species of insect, penises that can punch through the chiton of a female and impregnate them exist. In others, males smear (sometimes)-nutritious goo on the face of the female and then have sex with her before she can clean her face and respond. Sometimes females have the upper hand - praying mantises come to mind - and sometimes it is the males.This suggesTechnology seems to replace the need for biological changes.

Unethical men could release sperm packages in a protective gel and propelled by nanotechnology to seek and attempt to impregnate women in pools, perhaps. I offer this suggestion as it directly fits the concept of selection in evolution and has some similarities in other animals.

12,"Looking at Spacex Starship as an example it will cost roughly the same as a 777 to build. Even if the cost is double at say $700 million, by 2035 thousands of people will be able to visit space.Starship may well cost less than $10 million within 2-3 years per launch. Elon Musk predicted that one Starship rocket launch could cost less in a few years.The thing about a Starship flight is that one gets to travel, say halfway across the world in 30 minutes and experience microgravity for longer than a Blue Origin or Virgin Galactic flight.I wrote the answer below on how it might be possible to do tLooking at Spacex Starship as an example it will cost roughly the same as a 777 to build.

Equally a trip to orbital space could cost a similar sum. Within a decade either this will be possible or Musk will have failed and the dream of viable and affordable access to space will be lost for another half century.If Spacex could operate a fleet of 100+ Starships this would be a breakthrough in cost effective access to low Earth orbit, the moon and on to Mars.Hopefully competition will emerge to further increase access and drive down costs. Otherwise with 100 Starships flying 100 times per year with 100 passengers Spacex could generate at least $1- 2 trillion in revenue over a decade. And that would be the least profitable part of its operation. Add in orbital services, military contracts, Starlink and missions to the moon and beyond and Spacex might have higher revenue numbers than the GDP of France.",49 followers,Awdhesh Singh,6.4K,5.3K,219.1M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Which-new-traits-are-humans-likely-to-evolve-due-to-the-incorporation-of-technology-in-our-lives

If you launch a drone that kills people, then you killed people. It is no use saying the computer did it, any more than a shooter can say the gun did it or a stabbed can say the knife did it.
