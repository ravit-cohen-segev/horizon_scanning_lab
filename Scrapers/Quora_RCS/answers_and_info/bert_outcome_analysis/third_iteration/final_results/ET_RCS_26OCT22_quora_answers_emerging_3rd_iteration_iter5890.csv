The world is currently experiencing a global talent crisis which is known to be adverse for many countries. It will cost various countries $8.5 trillion by 2030. The only country that will be safe in such scenario is none other than India. It is because it is the only major world economy with potential for talent surplus. After beholding India’s development, one can safely assume that it will be on the top, sometime in future. It has the caliber to compete with America on platforms like technology, media, and telecommunications.",6 followers,Boris Ivanov,979,10.4K,110.8M,2019,https://www.quora.com/In-which-area-or-technology-can-India-emerge-as-a-global-leader-in-the-coming-decade

However, according to former Indian science and technology minister Kapil Sibal, India is lagging in science and technology compared to developed countries. India has only 140 researchers per 1,000,000 population, compared to 4,651 in the United States. India invested US $ 3.7 billion in science and technology in 2002–2003. For comparison, China invested about four times more than India, while the United States invested approximately 75 times more than India on science and technology. The highest-ranked Indian university for engineering and technology in 2014 was the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay at number 16; natural science ranks lower.While India has increased its output of scientific papers fourfold between 2000 and 2015 overtaking Russia and France in absolute number of papers per year, that rate has been exceeded by China and Brazil; Indian papers generate fewer cites than average, and relative to its population it has few scientists.Thirty Meter TelescopeThe Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT) is a planned, eighteen story, astronomical observatory and extremely large telescope to be built on the summit of Mauna Kea in the state of Hawaii. The TMT is designed for near-ultraviolet to mid-infrared (0.31 to 28 μm wavelengths) observations, featuring adaptive optics to assist in correcting image blur. The TMT will be at the highest altitude of all the proposed ELTs.

In other words, by the late 20th century medicine had come a long way from what it was say 50 years earlier (than 1980) lets say.

13,"I think so. Improved response times is ensuring patients get to the hospital more quickly these days. Better trauma care is the other major improvement. For most gunshot victims, the loss of blood is the biggest immediate threat to life. Shock can set in quickly, followed by unconsciousness and death. One of the areas where there has been major improvement is with techniques to control bleeding in areas that are difficult to apply pressure to, such as armpits, groin or the neck.
