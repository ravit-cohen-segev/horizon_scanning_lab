0,"Because, over an evolutionary time span, eating humans has been seriously bad news.If you eat a gazelle, the other gazelles run away. If you try to eat a baby monkey the monkey group may try to defend it but if you succeed nothing much will happen.If you eat a human, people will come after you with spears and arrows. They will kill not just you but members of your family and even other members of your species. They will not forget. They will continue to kill your species for years.How does evolution solve this problem? You evolve not to eat humans.",728 followers,Martin Hogbin,10.2K,5.8K,3.5M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Are-Predators-more-intelligent-than-humans-or-just-more-advanced-technologically-speaking
1,Why are most land predators faster than any human being?Because there is no selection pressure on the human species to be any faster. Humans usually hunt in groups and use ranged weapons. More often than not a predator would long be incapacitated before being able to reach any human in the hunting party. That was true for spears and bows and is even more true for modern firearms.,18 followers,Asim Qureshi,12.7K,996,155.9M,2017,https://www.quora.com/Are-Predators-more-intelligent-than-humans-or-just-more-advanced-technologically-speaking

3,"Yes, the move to modern agriculture. Most of the past sucked. We can romanticize it, but it sucked. The hunter gatherer was subsistence living. You pretty much got enough hopefully to do you from starving today. Maybe the odd lucky hunt feed you for a week until the meat rotted.So we developed agriculture. Farming. We could grow our own livestock instead of chasing it. We could grow field of food regularly instead of searching for it.",0 followers,Dr Jo,816,2.1K,16.4M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Are-Predators-more-intelligent-than-humans-or-just-more-advanced-technologically-speaking

7,"Well, as a Canadian you have to remember that the U.S. is the “Greatest Country In The World” Minor differences are that Canada has a longer life expectancy than the U.S.; fewer baby deaths at birth, and Universal Health Care, which provides the last two comments.

Apple has been struggling to innovate since Jobs died. It’s an insular, almost arrogant company - which was fine with Jobs at the helm, but without him I don’t think the management has been as effective. Most of Apple’s revenues comes from the iPhone which has been un-inspirational in recent cycles and in many ways outclassed by rival products - and this dependability on the iPhone also means the company is not as diversified as Google or Microsoft. If Apple loses its sex appeal with fickle consumers, like Blackberry did - it just takes a few bad product cycles for that to happen - things could turn around for the worse relatively fast.Saying this, I don’t think any of them are going to fall anytime soon.",18 followers,Asim Qureshi,14.4K,996,155.9M,2017,https://www.quora.com/Are-Predators-more-intelligent-than-humans-or-just-more-advanced-technologically-speaking
14,"Generated more revenue streams and made Microsoft more viable business for much longer term than Google and Apple.90% of the Google’s income is from ads.

But Apple’s most of the revenue is based on the iPhone. If consumers started migrating from iPhones, iPads and Mac to other devices in the future, they will end up in the same fate of Blackberry.Let's look at the Microsoft's revenue distribution chartMicrosoft has more reliable businesses than Apple and Google where it has primarily the enterprise customers whom couldn't easily migrate from its services. Even if one or two services fall in the future, it could manage with the other revenue streams until it bounce back with an alternate businesses.Hence, Microsoft has more viable and long lasting business entity than the Google or Apple which are predominantly based on their monopoly in the ads and hardware business.",0 followers,Lucas Martin,5.2K,65,4.2M,2017,https://www.quora.com/Are-Predators-more-intelligent-than-humans-or-just-more-advanced-technologically-speaking
