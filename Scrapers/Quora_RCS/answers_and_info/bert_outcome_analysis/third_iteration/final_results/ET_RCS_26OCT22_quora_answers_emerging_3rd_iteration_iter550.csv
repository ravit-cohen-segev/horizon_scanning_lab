They treat education the way they would treat a manufacturing process. Use quality control; measure everything; fix problems as soon as they are discovered; please the customer; show zero tolerance for lousy teaching; treat course descriptions as a legally binding contract for what will be learned by those who take the course and apply themselves.When professors create final exams, their exams are scrutinized and approved by independent reviewers before they can be given to students.I spoke to one such reviewer, Ed Lazowska, when he was here recently to review the NUS Computer Science Department. He told me he could notThere is also a culture throughout Singapore that being in a STEM (science/technology/engineering/mathematics) field makes you normal, not a geek.

5,"StanfordStanford is also the most laid-back of the four schools. The Stanford administration can be downright ditsy. The curriculum is easy enouStanfordStanford is also the most laid-back of the four schools. The Stanford administration can be downright ditsy. The curriculum is easy enough that if you are smart you can get A’s and still have time for your budding start-up. Stanford loves multiple choice exams more than any other school I’ve seen. If you did well on the SAT/GRE (which you probably did if Stanford admitted you), then this should be comforting.When I went I went to Stanford in early 2000’s, they were still big on using old-school SUN SPARC workstations. If you don’t know what those are, read about Sun Microsystems, and in particular its history with Stanford. Basically, this a UNIX environment that no one really uses anymore. It’s real UNIX, not Linux. The company Sun Microsystems doesn’t even exist anymore, because they got eaten up by Larry Ellison’s empire, Oracle. I found it quite funny that Stanford was still using these SUN machines, since everything else about the campus gives a modern vibe.Another feature that stands out about Stanford’s CS curriculum is that first-year students had to learn C and pointer arithmetic, which is missing from a lot of CS curriculums that have gone object-oriented. This may have all changed though. I’ve heard that in recent years, Stanford has made a big push to make their first-year CS class accessible to non-majors. So much so that it is now the most popular course on the entire campus. They also apparently now have a whole course in making iOS apps, undoubtedly to serve the cravings of all those start-up kids.BerkeleyBut in other ways, CS at Berkeley and Stanford actually share a lot in common. If you know the history of UNIX, there’s a guy named Bill Joy who was a PhD student at Berkeley once upon a time in the 70’s. He created BSD UNIX at Berkeley, which made Berkeley CS famous. He also became a founder of Sun Microsystems, the company mentioned above that sold Stanford all their computing equipment. So both Berkeley and Stanford are UNIX schools, united by the vision of Bill Joy.At Berkeley CS, most of the computers I saw ran a more modern version of this BSD UNIX operating system — OS X. That’s right, Macs everywhere at Berkeley. At least, in the CS department. Around the rest of campus, it was a mixture of Macs and ancient Windows PCs. Remote login machines used in CS were I think Linux, if memory serves correctly, but I’ve forgotten by now. Basically, there’s nothing remarkable at all about the computing hardware at Berkeley. It was neither state-of-the-art nor uber-retro like the SUN machines I saw at Stanford.The first year course, from what I remember, taught a mixture of object-oriented programming in (I think) Java, low-level stuff in C, and functional programming in LISP. My memory could be a little off, and I never took the first year course there so it’s best to look for yourself, but I seem to recall that Berkeley seemed to have the most balanced first-year curriculum. They try to teach you a bit of everything, in comparison to a lot of schools that may only teach you one programming language and methodology.Besides teaching you practical stuff, Berkeley is also really strong in theoretical computer science. That’s always been true, and even though Stanford has some significant figures like Knuth (who is more-or-less retired), I’d say that Berkeley is overall stronger in theory than Stanford, while still maintaining its hacker credentials. Berkeley’s Math Department is only a short walk from the CS Department, and it’s a real powerhouse — one of the strongest pure math departments in the world. If you want to tackle (or just learn about) the really deep theoretical problems in computer science, like the P vs NP problem, I think Berkeley is the best place to be out of the top four CS schools.Most of the campus, with the exception of the CS building and a couple of the newer engineering buildings, could really use a fresh paint job on the interior. For instance, check out the Math building. The bathrooms have graffiti everywhere. This is Berkeley. It’s a public school. It’s not trying to be pretentious. I’m not saying the campus is extremely ugly, but compared to Stanford where they try to keep everything looking shiny, Berkeley is for people who don’t judge a book by its cover.A lot of people think of Berkeley as being very liberal politically, but that shouldn’t scare you away if you’re a conservative. I found that it was easier being a conservative at Berkeley than Stanford, at least. Stanford has less free-spirited hippie liberals but more SJW liberals. If you know the difference, one group generally supports free speech and the other shuns it. Berkeley, I think, also has more conservatives in numbers. That said, with recent riots I’ve seen on TV, I’m not sure if Berkeley is still safe for free speech, and I would just avoid political expression now to be on the safe-side. Kind of a shame — it definitely wasn’t that way when I was there.The biggest downside to Berkeley is that the administration is really bureaucratic and will treat you like you’re no more significant than a fly on the wall. Thankfully, most of the professors there aren’t like that, and my experience with professors in the computer science department was very positive. When they meet a student who really wants to push boundaries, they are very supportive. At Stanford, the professors seemed more aloof and less approachable. Could just be my experience. Overall, the Berkeley experience is a great experience, and I think I like the culture there the best.MITMIT was a big deal before the personal computer revolution. Generally speaking, that’s where hacking culture originated. At the same time, I have the perception that people at MIT live in their own world, and kind of ignore the rest of us, which has caused their relevance in computing to shrink over time.Historically, a lot of thing developed by MIT never took off outside of MIT. One reason for that, I think, is because MIT could afford much more powerful computing equipment than other places. So, when they developed software, they never really concerned themselves about whether the software would run well on lower power hardware.UNIX for instance — which was not developed at MIT — was designed specifically to run on cheap low-end computing hardware at the time. Berkeley and Stanford made a big adoption of UNIX, and their CS curriculum was very influenced by that. The hacking culture at Berkeley and Stanford was grounded in the philosophy of UNIX, which is all about writing very efficient stream-lined code.The MIT hacking philosophy is most visible today in Emacs. Even though, Stallman was never officially a student at MIT, he was part of that hacking culture at the time. Emacs is supposed to be just a text editor, but if you’ve ever used it, you know it has an everything-but-the-kitchen-sink philosophy to design, which made it painful to run on most computers at the time. Whether or not MIT deserves the stereotype, I definitely associate over-design and lack of pragmatism with MIT schooling.In CS classes, MIT for many many decades, used the Scheme programming language for teaching its first-year CS classes. Scheme is essentially a version of LISP that has never been used in any major software projects outside of academia. Today, very few software projects use LISP and even fewer use Scheme. You can make all kinds of arguments about the value of functional programming, and the pedagogical beauty of Scheme as a language, and none of those arguments counter the fact that no one else uses it.Unlike learning C, Scheme won’t teach you anything about pointer arithmetic or give you a sense of how your code will actually run on the hardware — you know, the kind of stuff that only matters if you care about optimizing your code for efficiency.Put it another way, every other CS program I know of tries to first teach its students a language that will be immediately useful to them when they leave school. MIT indoctrinates its students in Scheme, a toy educational language.Or at least they did…until they switched to Python several years ago, probably after getting blow-back from their graduates who innocently put Scheme on their resume. But Python still won’t teach you pointer arithmetic or the grueling work of doing your own memory management.I should point out that I’ve never been a student at MIT, but everything I know about their educational philosophy pretty much makes them the anti-Stanford. They don’t care at all about what industry wants. You’ll probably still be able to get a job in industry, because the MIT brand name carries a lot of weight. But don’t expect anyone outside of MIT to actually care what you learned at MIT. Also, don’t expect MIT to stoop to the level of teaching something that might be useful for your start-up, like best practices for building iPhone apps. If you want to learn how to do anything practical, you’re on your own.MIT will do a decent job of teaching you the fundamentals of computer science, but so will most decent computer science programs. Honestly, that alone shouldn’t make them one of the top 4 schools. The fundamentals of computer science haven’t really changed much since the 70’s anyway. But MIT’s curriculum seems like it’s too frozen in time for a school that claims to be the best of the best. Even their algorithms course doesn’t seem to teach anything newer than the 70’s. I look at their standard curriculum, and I just see a dry lowest-common denominator CS curriculum that is not innovative in anyway. MIT’s undergrad CS program would not be special at all, if it weren’t for the smart kids who go there.So MIT = very smart students, unimpressive standard vanilla curriculum, culture of not caring about things that are practical in computing.CMUI have a very positive impression of CMU’s CS curriculum though, just by looking at it. I would say that my general impression is that while MIT doesn’t care at all about industry, and Stanford cares too much about industry, CMU tries to care about what it thinks industry will care more about in the future.In other words, CMU does what CS schools should be doing, answering the question:I’ve always had the sense that CMU School of Computer Science is very keen on shifting both its curriculum and research to trends it sees happening in the future, more so than the other schools.For instance, CMU requires their students to learn parallel algorithms, which is going to become more and more important as computing hardware becomes more and more parallel.CMU also has the hardest first-year theory course of probably anywhere.CMU’s Computer Science program also has a greater level autonomy that at the other schools, since they have their own School of Computer Science. They admit directly, and they can choose admissions criteria to reflect what they think is needed to do best in their program. So I think this leads to changes happening faster at CMU than elsewhere.Of course, that may also lead to a fairly insular culture. I don’t know enough people who went there to really say. Most of the people who go there seem to be pure computer science nerds, who want to dig deep into the CS internals, but aren’t really that interested in entrepreneurship activities like the Stanford students. Lack of interest in entrepreneurship and being a little less smart than MIT students are probably the only two downsides to being a CMU CS student.CMU, unlike Berkeley, is still a private school so I’ve been told that the administration is a lot more responsive when you have a problem that needs to be dealt with. They are very much aware of who pays their bills, so if a parents complains to them about a problem their student is dealing with, the administration will take it very seriously. So in that sense, I guess it could be said that CMU coddles their students a little bit more. At Berkeley, and many other large public universities, you have to grow up and deal with bullshit on your own because no one will be there to save you.Summary (TLDR):My general sentiment is that Berkeley today is theOnly problem with Berkeley is that it’s a public school and outside of Computer Science, you will have to deal with inane paper pushers who are paid way too much for the job they do. Not to mention the occasional hippie. Not really a big deal.Also, I guess one other downside worth mentioning is Berkeley doesn’t directly help its alumni like prestigious private schools do. Once you graduate, you truly are on your own. You can’t just call up a number like at many of the Ivy Leagues, and have someone connect you with an alumni who will pull strings for you to get you an interview. At Berkeley, no one will likely even answer, because if such a number does exist it goes to one of those inane paper pushers who don’t answer their phone.",UNKNOWN,Anonymous,1.3K,0,0,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-top-world-technology-development-centers
6,"You’ve got a number of answers here from MIT alumni, who honestly sound rather elitist, and therefore may not be giving you the proper perspective.When you ask if Georgia Tech is in the same ranks as MIT, Caltech, Stanford and UCB, there are three factors to consider:You’ve got a number of answers here from MIT alumni, who honestly sound rather elitist, and therefore may not be giving you the proper perspective.When you ask if Georgia Tech is in the same ranks as MIT, Caltech, Stanford and UCB, there are three factors to consider:To answer the first question, Georgia Tech is significantly less selective than MIT, Caltech and Stanford. And it is slightly less selective than UCB, but not by the same order of magnitude as the other three.So your average admit to Georgia Tech is likely to be less accomplished than your average admit to MIT. But what exactly does that mean?Well, it’s very important to remember that we are talking aboutSo what is the real difference between the admit pool of MIT and the admit pool of Georgia Tech?Both groups will consist of students of above average intelligence. The main difference is that MIT is not just looking for smart kids, but they want you to have documentedA lot of this boils down to the environment you were in growing up.So while it may be tempting to assume that the MIT pool is full of significantly more brilliant kids than the Georgia Tech pool, just because fewer demonstrate what MIT is looking for while in high school, the reality is quite a bit cloudier.Let’s move on to the next question, concerning the quality of education you will receive. Of course, quality in education is subjective, and as an educator there are two different goals you can aspire to:In an ideal world, instructors would be able to teach in such a way as to maximize both of these goals equally without compromise. But in the real imperfect world, you are lucky to have a teacher who is very good at accomplishing one of these two goals.At schools like MIT/Caltech, the culture is such that there’s an extreme bias towards the first goal over the second. The professors assume that there are going to be a lot of kids with extraordinary potential in their classes, since that’s the admission criteria, and so they see it as their duty to push those kids to their full potential.So at MIT/Caltech, you will probably get a much higher workload and harder problem sets in your normal classes.Georgia Tech, on the other hand, is more likely to focus on the second goal. When professors are teaching a very difficult concept, they are more likely to spend time thinking about how they can present the concept in such a way that all the students in the class will be able to appreciate it, not just the most brilliant students.Note that I assume the students who struggle the most at MIT/Caltech would be better off at Georgia Tech. In fact, I would assume that any student who is close to the median at MIT/Caltech would be better off at Georgia Tech.Why? Well, because I have actually talked to “average students” at MIT who confessed to me that they stillSoI am sure the professors at Georgia Tech will be more than happy to find additional challenges for students who want additional challenges. The only real difference between MIT/Caltech and Georgia Tech is that the latter will require you to push yourself more if you want to be challenged as much as you would be at MIT/Caltech.Notice that I haven’t mentioned Stanford or UCB yet. That’s because these two schools have even different educational philosophies.To blunt, the culture at Stanford is not to push their undergrads too hard because they don’t want to hurt their precious self-esteem. So if you’re not self-motivated, I doubt you would learn more at Stanford than Georgia Tech. And if you are self-motivated, you will have more or less the same opportunities as an undergrad at both Stanford and Georgia Tech. So I see no educational advantage to Stanford over Georgia Tech, other than branding.Berkeley is interesting. Like MIT/Caltech, Berkeley pushes its students hard, but it doesn’t assume that its students are extraordinarily gifted, so maybe not quite as hard as MIT/Caltech. You are also more likely to have a class at Berkeley that fails both goals (doesn’t help the students at the top of the class or the students at the bottom). Classes are hit or miss at Berkeley, and there’s a huge amount of bureaucracy to contend with.That said, if you are a very self-motivated student, Berkeley will provide you resources that are just as good if not better than the other schools.So hopefully I have convinced you that in many scenarios, you would learn just as much at Georgia Tech as you would at MIT, Caltech, Stanford or Berkeley.Finally, what will employers think?From the limited knowledge that I have, they like Georgia Tech a lot!MIT/Caltech kids may have a slight advantage initially at getting interviews, simply because those schools have a certain mystique about them (which quite frankly I think is a little overrated).But if you distinguish yourself as a top student at Georgia Tech, there’s no reason that employers won’t be knocking on your door. Keep in mind that Georgia Tech is one of the best schools in the South, so employers that are regional to that area may actually put more effort into recruiting from Georgia Tech than MIT. There is a such thing as a regional advantage. The chances of getting someone from MIT to move to Atlanta are slim, so why put a lot of effort there?On the other hand, I would automatically assume that you would be disadvantaged for jobs in the Boston area with a Georgia Tech degree rather than an MIT degree. People from Massachusetts (who didn’t go to MIT) tend to be just as cynical about the elitism of MIT/Harvard as I am. That’s not to say they won’t interview them, but if they detect an elitist attitude (like some of the answers here), they might be more inclined to hire the Georgia Tech grad who doesn’t have that superiority complex.I would say that the one job market where the MIT/Caltech degree will give you the biggest advantage is California.Now if we’re comparing Georgia Tech to Berkeley or Stanford, in terms of ease of finding employment, I think that the difference is going to be marginal.In other words, if this is a clustering problem, I would tend to group Georgia Tech, Berkeley and Stanford in the same class.And I would group MIT and Caltech is separate class, but note that probably 30%–60% of the students at MIT/Caltech would be better served if they had gone elsewhere.And Stanford, in particular, is incredibly overrated. It’s incredibly difficult to get into, but in terms of outcomes, it doesn’t really do that much better than schools that are much easier to get into. Arguably, it does worse.And between Berkeley and Georgia Tech, they’re close enough in standards, that if Georgia Tech gives you a significantly better offer financially, then I would choose Georgia Tech.","5,074 followers",Jeff Ronne,807,3.8K,7M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-top-world-technology-development-centers
