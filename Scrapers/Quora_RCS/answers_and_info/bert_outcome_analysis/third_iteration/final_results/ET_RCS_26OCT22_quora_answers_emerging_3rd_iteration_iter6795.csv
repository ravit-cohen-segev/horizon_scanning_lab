0,"No, but we have largely removed ourselves from the process of natural selection. Medical technology allows people who would normally be selected for deletion by natural selection to survive and pass on deleterious genes on to subsequent generations seriously depleting the quality of the gene pool. Eventually we will be a species completely dependent on medical technology for our survival from birth. Hopefully our advances in genetic technology will help us overcome this before it’s too late.","220,635 followers",Franklin Veaux,1.8K,47.3K,783M,2022,https://www.quora.com/Do-you-think-human-technological-advances-means-that-humans-are-no-longer-evolving-biologically

4,"Any tool use is technology.Dairying, the routine keeping of mammals for milk production, is a historically important technology. And in cultures where dairying was developed, we generally see the evolution of lactase persistance — the generation of the enzyme to digest milk sugar long after typical weaning.The opposite, wild-type condition is lactose intolerance. It can be quite unpleasant, because if you don’t digest milk sugar there are bacteria in your gut which will be quite happy to do so — with the concomitant production of copious quantities of gas.

Their main concern for spacecraft is WEIGHT: how many watts per gram or ounce of solar panels can you get. Improving energy efficiency improves weight efficiency usually, so those 2 measures are highly correlated.How is this efficiency increased? Mainly by making ever more complex (and expensive) multi-layer cells, where each layer is designed to absorb a particular band of radiation wavelengths efficiently and passing other wavelengths to the other layers below.The measure of efficiency that the vast majority of people care about is the economic efficiency, usually measured in cost per watt of power or cost per watt-hour of energy over a system’s lifetime. These measures have been improving much faster than the power conversion efficiency, mainly due to learning how to maximize the use of manufacturing capital by building ever bigger and more efficient factories. The details are usually considered trade secrets.Here are some cost trend (economic efficiency) links to cost graphs.","3,671 followers",William Mook,1K,9.3K,12.6M,2022,https://www.quora.com/Do-you-think-human-technological-advances-means-that-humans-are-no-longer-evolving-biologically

12,"To begin, it can be said that technology is the application of knowledge about how existence works to achieve things we want as intelligent beings. This is a basic understanding that many people do not seem to understand. Intelligence is determined by the genes we inherit and may be reduced by encounters with the environment (disease, toxins, and head trauma). Nothing in the environment will increase your intelligence.Carl Jung said in his book“To begin, it can be said that technology is the application of knowledge about how existence works to achieve things we want as intelligent beings.

Let it band together into groups and organizations as much as it likes – it is just this banding together and the resultant extinction of the individual personality that makes it succumb so readily to a dictator. A million zeros joined together do not, unfortunately, add up to one. Ultimately everything depends on the quality of the individual, but our fatally short-sighted age thinks only in terms of large numbers and mass organizations, though one would think that the world had seen more than enough of what a well-disciplined mob can do in the hand of a single madman.In the late 1940s,“Today, most positively promising -- Emmanuelle Charpentier andConversely, after years of frustrating attempts to find the genes that actually determine intelligence, a breakthrough happened. It is known as genome wide association studies (GWAS).With all of that said, however, we can now posit the inference from an evolutionary perspective. It can be said that humanity's greatest unsung event of technological developments would beFurther, most people do not understand that the technology of language as it is used through body language to spoken language to written language to teach a human from birth through adulthood actually physically changes the wiring of the human brain. Language as it is used to teach humans civilized knowledge actually rewires how the human brain works. So, not only would we have no civilization at all without the technology of language, that technology has significantly physically altered our brains.We now have more than 10 times the population in the 19th century when Ned Ludd headed a group of English textile workers in protesting the use of new machines that would render their jobs useless. Yet there are plenty of more new jobs. The automobile did the same thing, the telephone switch board, the personal computer, and now overused “buzzwords” like AI and robots will follow the same path with uncertainties. Genetics and nuerobiological variations are dependent on individual variances etc. Hence, individualized traits may influences motivations and drives. Etc.The global population at the beginning of the industrial revolution in 1760 was 770 million. In 1980, an arbitrary year I chose as the beginning of the robot revolution, the population was 4.4 billion. With almost six times more people, all it would take to beat the first record is an 18% penetration rate for automation.Other than grand advances in high pixelated screens filled with some higher resolutions of software being programmed and the expectations of new technologies have fallen. To drive growth in a post-pandemic world, we should remember that real economic progress has in the past been driven by hard science – not flashy consumer gadgetry. For years, hopes for productivity growth have been pinned on “Fourth Industrial Revolution” technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), the Internet of Things (IoT), and 3D-printing. But, in contrast to previous industrial revolutions, recent advances in digital technology have not resulted in the expected boost in productivity. Labour productivity growth has been stagnating since the 1970s. In the UK, it’s actually at its slowest rate in 200 years. Stagnating productivity has not gone unnoticed.Having banged the drum of the Fourth Industrial Revolution since 2016, the World Economic Forum has now changed its narrative to the “Great Reset”. No doubt this change reflects new economic realities wrought by the pandemic, but it’s also a silent admission that the forth industrial revolution has dramatically under-delivered on its promises of productivity and prosperity. Why? First, dominant firms that possess the fourth industrial revolution technologies are hindering their diffusion by leveraging their technological advantage to further entrench their dominance and reduce competition.This is a manifestation of the emergent properties of software technology, which is subject to large fixed costs but low marginal costs, enables larger firms to develop better-quality products and services than their smaller rivals. That leaves smaller firms facing high obstacles and low benefits when considering the adoption of fourth revolution technologies. Many elect simply to continue without them. And, this means that fourth industrial revolution technologies are not diffusing fast enough. The gap between the “technology haves and have nots” in the corporate world is widening. A recent study also found that this gap is widening between rich countries and poor countries. It was general-purpose technologies – such as steam engines and the electric dynamo – that powered change in previous industrial revolutions. At present, it remains unclear whether 4IR technologies can do the same.That said however, for example,Time makes these problems worse, as popular programs become part of an informal social contract that makes them nearly impossible to reform; as the administrative state gets barnacled by interest groups that can buy off and bludgeon would-be reformers; and as the proliferation of regulations handcuffs administrators and deprives them of the room to respond to changing times. In other words, the New Deal could only happen once, and whatever competence prevailed at its experimental dawn no longer exists. Then there is what is referred to as “Since the spectrum variations are complex and highly complicated but considered the general acceptable application of nuances. Whereas in the fifties, the sixties, the seventies, and the eighties all had distinctive by-the-decade styles in design, clothing, music, and art, from the nineties to now feels like one big remix. We are stuck in a boomer culture loop, explains[13]Lastly, Carl Jung Said inThe statistical method shows the facts in the light of the ideal average but does not give us a picture of their empirical reality. While reflecting an indisputable aspect of reality, it can falsify the actual truth in a most misleading way. This is particularly true of theories which are based on statistics. The distinctive thing about real facts, however, is their individuality. Not to put too fine a point on it, once could say that the real picture consists of nothing but exceptions to the rule, and that, in consequence, absolute reality has predominantly the character of irregularity.Footnotes","7,437 followers",Xianhang Zhang,1.6K,812,2.5M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Do-you-think-human-technological-advances-means-that-humans-are-no-longer-evolving-biologically
