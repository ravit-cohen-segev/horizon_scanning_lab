0,"Transfer learning in ML models.Humans are really good at generalizing. We only have to see a few dogs before we can recognize a dog when we see one.Machines are not. ML models require millions of examples before forming a reliable classifier, and that classifier is very specific to the data on which it was trained. If your training data doesn't include dogs with three legs, the model won't recognize them. A machine that plays Go is useless at checkers.Transfer learning is the ability to apply a model from one domain to a different one.

If your training data doesn't include dogs with three legs, the model won't recognize them. A machine that plays Go is useless at checkers.Transfer learning is the ability to apply a model from one domain to a different one. It's hypothesized that the reason humans learn so quickly is that we are fitting new examples into our existing knowledge rather than forming entirely new categories. If we could teach machines to do the same, they would learn exponentially faster and apply that learning more effectively.Transfer learning is a very hot topic in AI research right now, so I expect major breakthroughs in the next few years. I think this may be sufficient to achieve artificial general intelligence, but even if not, it will dramatically extend the range of tasks that machines can accomplish.","246,828 followers",Dushka Zapata,1.5K,8.5K,232.4M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Is-digitization-the-next-technology-in-the-education-industry

5,It has to do with economics of producing processors. The more dense the process the more expensive the silicon per square mm. Also making big chips increases a chance of a defect which cause the entire chip to be unusable. Big chips not only cost more by area but also by lowered yield of functioning product.AMD has innovated in this space however and are building chiplet based CPUs. For instance see the Threadripper line of processors. They are quite large compared to previous CPUs as they are built from multiple chips spaced out on a substrate.This does help with cooling as we are hitting theIt has to do with economics of producing processors.

In science, a lot can be done with programs that simulate environments, like the physics simulations that showed the creation of an Oort cloud, showing how comets are created. You can simulate different types of temperatures to learn how a material will react (they did this a lot with graphene, the super-material, to determine whether it was worthwhile to produce).And finally, they’re just fun. Look through pictures of Minecraft or Powder Toy or Blender to see feats of incredible creativity. The picture I put above of a tsunami destroying a city in Blender is truly a work of art.","9,587 followers",Max Searle,2.1K,82,6.7M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-next-technological-feat-that-Hyperloop-has-to-demonstrate-in-order-to-keep-on-pace-for-a-viable-product
