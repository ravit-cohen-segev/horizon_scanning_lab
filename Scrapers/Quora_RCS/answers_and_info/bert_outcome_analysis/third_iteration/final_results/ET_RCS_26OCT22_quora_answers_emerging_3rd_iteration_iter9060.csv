I can clearly see that we were too different and not quite right for each other.You decide: is that better or worse?I’m at midlife; I don’t have an unlimited amount of time left. I don’t want to build new relationships and discover a crucial incompatibility ten years down the road. So now, I put a lot of additional care in my relationships, and that includes taking any problems seriously. If this makes my relationships fail, I think: better now than later.Here’s something to think about: if your relationship generates a lot of problems that need to be communicated about, isn’t that in itself a sign that the fit is not as good as it should be? Is it truly wise to pretend otherwise?Yes, I currently spend quite a bit of time and effort communicating about expectations, discomforts, worries and concerns with my partners. But most of the time, I feel unburdened, safe and happy, because I know that any obstacles I can see are out there in the open, and we trust that they are not insurmountable.

When you love someone, putting up with their 90’s grunge when you prefer 60’s blues is not the end of the world. Watching a movie you wouldn’t choose yourself is not the end of the world.I rather prefer dating someone who doesn’t share all my interests. I enjoy watching him play the blues, I enjoy watching him geek out over Star Wars and Lord of the Rings. I enjoy it because these things are important to him, and although he isn’t much for the visual arts, he enjoys watching me paint, hangs my work up all over his bedroom, and bought me new art supplies for my birthday. He has exposed me to a lot of things that I never would have been exposed to if not for dating him. I like learning new things, I’ve even picked up a few chords on the guitar.Bottom line is appreciate your partner and look at the differences not as something keeping you apart, but rather as an opportunity to share things that are important to you and learn about things that are important to them. Also, in a relationship, the more your lives become intertwined, the harder it can be to maintain your own identity and space. Having differing interests is a healthy way to get your “me time” in.

I attempted suicide when I got out because I was so lonely. What worked was 2 years of intensive DBT, exercise, and building myself back up step by step.

Industrial output was the highest in the country, the state frequently attracted people from as far as Rajasthan and Gujarat when it came down to business, life was really cheerful. Interestingly enough, those were even the days when Maharashtra wasn’t your typical rich state, and Mumbai was the hub of leftist-dominated trade unions (unlike today, the mills of Mumbai were serious cash - generator for the economy there).But today, it’s a different story altogether.Somewhere in 1952, the Indian government enacted what is called a “Freight equalization Policy”. This led to a situation where resources from one state could be used to set up industries in a completely different state. Unlike the British era where industries were being set up right in places where resources were, this time such wasn’t the case. However, this was just a small part of it.A lot began happening in West Bengal in a seriously wrong way, exactly from the 1960s. The state was battling two things at the same timeThe second one was quashed actively in days of emergency by likes of Siddharth Shankar Ray, the then CM of the state and Indira Gandhi’s Bengal henchman.Later on, after the emergency was lifted and there was a change in government, that began a series of serious downward trends, because guess who came to power?If you ask your average Indian about any politician who really was the hallmark of a bad leader, they are very likely to point at someone like Moraji Desai, Rajiv Gandhi or Mulayam Singh, Lalu Prasad Yadav. Yeah, he destroyed Bihar, turned kidnapping of people into an industry and there is no denial in that. However, few would ever have a vivid discussion when it came toJyoti Basu’s biggest gift to the state of West Bengal? His goddamn ideology!!!!And what exactly his ideology did? Well, it successfully ended up making sure toThe things remained for long enough, and apparently people expected that after 2011, maybe there will be a sea change with Mamata Banerjee coming to power. Well, Mamata Banerjee did indeed destroy the bandh culture of CPI(M), but then as thing is, bandhs are fine if they are done by her side. And what about the industries, development and the rest of the others? Well, let’s say that the government has changed and therefore the ones doing all of the above changed the parties. Nothing much has changed, only that unlike then, today the rest of India actually knows about the wrong things happening in the current Bengal government.Today the situation in Bengal is something that as long as one sticks close to the suburban areas, all looks fine. However the state is decaying, and a huge credit, in the end, goes to Jyoti Basu.",12 followers,Sayak Biswas,1.9K,2.4K,22.5M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Which-communication-issues-six-months-into-in-a-relationship-are-most-unlikely-to-ever-be-fixable

22,"I have lived in Bengal for more than 6 years and I can say it is easiest to instigate Mamta Bannerjee. Once you are successful in instigating her then she will carry forward chain of self instigation from there.We need to understand the present political situation in India. Rahul Gandhi has suddenly become super active to present himself as the biggest Modi's attacker. Although Rahul Gandhi is a dumb but he is being handled by team of political expert. With the support of data analyst, he has been able to get some public sentiments on various occasions, three state elections are among them.BJPI have lived in Bengal for more than 6 years and I can say it is easiest to instigate Mamta Bannerjee.

With the support of data analyst, he has been able to get some public sentiments on various occasions, three state elections are among them.BJP played a clever tactics to divert the attention of public from Congress to BJP vs Mamata battle. It is a well calculated approach of BJP to project a fight between Modi and Mamata. By this move, BJP is not only going to gain political benefit in West Bengal but also in rest of India. Indian citizen, except some Mamta supporters in Bengal and some Modi core haters in rest of India, no one likes Mamata Bannerjee. Everyone knows she is a dictator. Even her MLAs, MPs, TMC members and Bengali people are aware of the fact about Mamata's characteristics. It is the easiest job of BJP to target the paranoid.Mamata Bannerjee is predictable, BJP used this nature of her by some moves.Now, I understood that BJP is an organized party of strategists. BJP is run by RSS but how many of RSS master minds have you seen or known? Do you see the difference - between Mamata Bannerjee (who is deaf to suggestions from strategists) and Modi (who is open to new idea and strategy).So, what is actually happening in Bengal nowadays - Initiation of 2019 General election preparations where Modi is controlling 'what will happen next'.",26 followers,Balaji Viswanathan,5.1K,5.6K,427.2M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Which-communication-issues-six-months-into-in-a-relationship-are-most-unlikely-to-ever-be-fixable
