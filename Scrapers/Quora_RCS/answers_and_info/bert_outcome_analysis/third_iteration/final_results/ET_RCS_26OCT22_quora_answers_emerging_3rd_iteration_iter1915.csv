4,"Professor Murzyn, of the University of Dundee, did an incredible study on the nature and visuals of dreams.They found that people who lived prior to color television tended much more to dream in black and white.Specifically, as of the 1940s, 70.7% reported rarely seeing colors in their dreams. While today, those numbers go in the opposite direction, with 17.7% saying they rarely see colors in their dreams.People who are 55 and older report having had black and white dreams about 25% of the time, while people 25 and younger were only half that.Professor Murzyn, of the University of Dundee, did an incredible study on the nature and visuals of dreams.They found that people who lived prior to color television tended much more to dream in black and white.Specifically, as of the 1940s, 70.7% reported rarely seeing colors in their dreams.

I was working at the Apple Store and I wanted a change. I wanted to start building the tech I was servicing.I started looking into Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI).There’s so much going on in the field.Every week it seems like Google or Facebook are releasing a new kind of AI to make things faster or improve our experience.Don’t get me started on the number of self-driving car companies. This is a good thing though. I’m not a fan of driving and roads are dangerous.Even with all this happening, there’s still yet to be an agreed definition of what exactly artificial intelligence is.Some argue deep learning can be considered AI, others will say it’s not AI unless it passes the Turing Test.This lack of definition really stunted my progress in the beginning. It was hard to learn something which had so many different definitions.Enough with the definitions.How did I get started?My friends and I were building a web startup. It failed. We gave up due to a lack of meaning. But along the way, I was starting to hearing more and more about ML and AI.“The computer learns the things for you?” I couldn’t believe it.I stumbled across Udacity’s Deep Learning Nanodegree. A fun character called Siraj Raval was in one of the promo videos. His energy was contagious. Despite not meeting the basic requirements (I had never written a line of Python before), I signed up.Three weeks before the course start date I emailed Udacity support asking what the refund policy was. I was scared I wouldn’t be able to complete the course.I didn’t get a refund. I completed the course within the designated timeline. It was hard. Really hard at times. My first two projects were handed in four days late. But the excitement of being involved in one of the most important technologies in the world drove me forward.Finishing the Deep Learning Nanodegree, I had guaranteed acceptance into either Udacity’s AI Nanodegree, Self-Driving Car Nanodegree or Robotics Nanodegree. All great options. I was a little lost. “Where do I go next?”I needed a curriculum. I’d built a little foundation with the Deep Learning Nanodegree, now it was time to figure out where I’d head next.My Self-Created AI Masters DegreeI didn’t plan on going back to university anytime soon. I didn’t have $100,000 for a proper Masters Degree anyway.So I did what I did in the beginning. Asked my mentor, Google, for help.I’d jumped into deep learning without any prior knowledge of the field. Instead of climbing to the tip of the AI iceberg, a helicopter had dropped me off on the top.After researching a bunch of courses, I put a list of which ones interested me the most in Trello.Trello is my personal assistant/course coordinator.I knew online courses had a high drop out rate. I wasn’t going to let myself be a part of this number. I had a mission.To make myself accountable, I started sharing my learning journey online. I figured I could practice communicating what I learned plus find other people who were interested in the same things I was. My friends still think I’m an alien when I go on one of my AI escapades.I made the Trello board publicThe curriculum has changed slightly since I first wrote it but it’s still relevant and I visit the Trello board multiple times per week to track my progress.Getting a jobI bought a plane ticket to the US with no return flight. I’d been studying for a year and I figured it was about time I started putting my skills into practice.My plan was to rock up to the US and get hired.Then Ashlee messaged me on LinkedIn, “Hey I’ve seen your posts and they’re really cool, I think you should meet Mike.”I met Mike.I told him my story of learning online, how I loved healthtech and my plans to go to the US.“You may be better off staying here a year or so and seeing what you can find, I’ think you’d love to meet Cameron.”I met Cameron.We had a similar chat what Mike and I talked about. Health, tech, online learning, US.“We’re working on some health problems, why don’t you come in on Thursday?”Thursday came. I was nervous. But someone once told me being nervous is the same as being excited. I flipped to being excited.I spent the day meeting the Max Kelsen team and the problems they were working on.Two Thursday’s later, Nick, the CEO, Athon, lead machine learning engineer, and I went for coffee.“How would you like to join the team?” Asked Nick.“Sure.” I said.My US flight got pushed back a couple months, I’ve also got a return ticket.Sharing your workLearning online, I knew it was unconventional. All the roles I’d gone to apply for had Masters Degree requirements or at least some kind of technical degree.I didn’t have either of these. But I did have the skills I’d gathered from a plethora of online courses.Along the way, I was sharing my work online. My GitHub contained all the projects I’d done, my LinkedIn was stacked out and I’d practiced communicating what I learned through YouTube and articles on Medium.I never handed in a resume for Max Kelsen. “We checked you out on LinkedIn and we were impressed.” My body of work was my resume.Regardless if you’re learning online or through a Masters Degree, having a portfolio of what you’ve worked on is a great way to build skin in the game.ML and AI skills are in demand but that doesn’t mean you don’t have to showcase them. Even the best product won’t sell without any shelf space.Whether it be GitHub, Kaggle, LinkedIn or a blog, have somewhere where people can find you. Plus, having your own corner of the internet is great fun.How do you start?Where do you go to learn these skills? What courses are the best?There’s no best answer. Everyone’s path will be different. Some people learn better with books, others learn better through videos.What’s more important than how you start is why you start.Start with why.Again, no right reason. All are valid in their own way.Start with why because having a why is more important than how. Having a why means when it gets hard and itGot a why? Good. Time for some hard skills.I can only recommend what I’ve tried.I’ve completed courses from (in order):They’re all world class. I’m a visual learner. I learn better seeing things being done/explained to me on. So all of these courses reflect that.If you’re an absolute beginner, start with some introductory Python courses and when you’re a bit more confident, move into data science, machine learning and AI.How much math?The highest level of math education I’ve had was in high school. The rest I’ve learned through Khan Academy as I’ve needed it.There are many different opinions on how much math you need to know to get into machine learning and AI. I’ll share mine.If you want to apply machine learning and AI techniques to a problem, you don’t necessarily need an in-depth understanding of the math to get a good result. Libraries such as TensorFlow and PyTorch allow someone with a bit of Python experience to build state of the art models whilst the math is taken care of behind the scenes.If you’re looking to get deep into machine learning and AI research, through means of a PhD program or something similar, having an in-depth knowledge of the math is paramount.In my case, I’m not looking to dive deep into the math and improve an algorithm’s performance by 10%. I’ll leave that to people smarter than me. Instead, I’m more than happy to use the libraries available to me and manipulate them to help solve problems as I see fit.What does a machine learning engineer actually do?What a machine engineer does in practice might not be what you think.Despite the cover photos of many online articles, it doesn’t always involve working with robots that have red eyes.Here are a few questions an ML engineer has to ask themselves daily.I borrowed these from a great article by Rachel Thomas, one of the co-founders ofFor more, I made a video of what we usually get up to on Monday’s at Max KelsenNo set pathThere’s no right or wrong way to get into ML or AI.The beautiful thing about this field is we have access to some of the best technologies in the world, all we’ve got to do is learn how to use them.You could begin by learning Python code.You could begin by studying calculus and statistics.You could begin by learning about the philosophy of decision making.Machine learning and AI fascinates me because of this intersection of fields.The more I learn about it, the more I realise there’s plenty more to learn. And this hypes me up.Sometimes I get frustrated when my code doesn’t run. Or I don’t understand a concept. So I give up temporarily. I give up by letting myself walk away from the problem and take a nap. Or go for a walk. When I come back it feels like I’m looking at it with different eyes. The excitement comes back. I keep learning.There’s so much happening in the field it can be daunting to get started. Too many options lead to no options. Ignore this.Start wherever interests you most and follow it. If it leads to a dead end, great, you’ve figured out what you’re not interested in. Retrace your steps and take the other fork in the road instead.Computers are smart but they still can’t learn on their own. They need your help.",16 followers,Daniel Bourke,6.9K,178,7.7M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Just-like-the-laptop-was-an-upcoming-trend-two-decades-ago-smartphones-were-an-upcoming-trend-a-decade-ago-Which-product-will-be-a-technological-revolution-in-the-next-decade
7,"To start off, machine learning and AI are subjects we can group together.Already, we’re seeing plenty of evidence that AI/machine learning is something to look forward to. Less than a decade ago, companies Google, Apple, and Microsoft invested less than 1% of their efforts into AI. Now, most of the future product ideas revolve somehow around AI.Also, AI is a technology that currently does not show any limits. There are so many forecasts as to how AI can and will be applied to pretty much any sector out there, from marketing to education, from medicine to policing.Now let’s look at cyber securiTo start off, machine learning and AI are subjects we can group together.Already, we’re seeing plenty of evidence that AI/machine learning is something to look forward to.

There are so many forecasts as to how AI can and will be applied to pretty much any sector out there, from marketing to education, from medicine to policing.Now let’s look at cyber security.As the world becomes more and more digital, this means that there is more information being poured into cyberspace. This also makes that information vulnerable to hackers.When governments and businesses start digitizing everything (making everything vulnerable) it can become a real concern. A company’s important financial documents could get hacked and messed with. Or maybe access to a country’s power grid that only the government is supposed to have. One could descend the world into chaos without having to move from their room.These dangers call for protection. Governments, countries, and individuals will all need to use more effective approaches if they want to survive in this data-centric economy.So, that’s an analysis of the 2 fields. In my opinion, AI probably is a safer choice for 2 reasons. One, we could solve the cyber security issue by implementing AI into security solutions. And two, AI has more variety as to what it can be used for. Cyber security is a lot more narrow. But in the end, it really does depend on your preference.",UNKNOWN,Ben Y.

That hardly translates into an AI that can think like a human and solve problems. There are no AIs currently that can reason about why your girlfriend suddenly got sullen and quiet with you, or why Billy down the street beat up a cat.Then there’s Ray Kurzweil. I’d like to get him on stage and beat him over the head with a mop for the terrible hype he generates regarding the ‘Singularity’. His time frame is wrong, his view is only an opinion, not fact nor provable fact. He angers me for conning the public into thinking humans are going to be threatened by AI overlords any time soon. Not going to happen. Making AIs as smart as people is exceedingly hard and it’s not soon in the cards. I say this as an AI researcher who works on these problems and I see how truly difficult they are. We can, and will solve some of the problems but we are a long way from AIs that can match human minds. An AI that plays Go better than humans is buildable because the game is a closed small universe. What humans have to work with is an enormous complicated world, and much harder to deal with.So, yes, AI is way hyped, and the promoters may be leading us to the next AI winter if they keep up the crap and eventually burn out expectations.",UNKNOWN,Sriraman Madhavan,4.1K,186,7.9M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-recent-and-upcoming-advancements-in-technology-related-to-dreaming
9,"I feel compelled to answer this question, because I disagree with most of the answers here.The common answer here seems to be: yes it will kill jobs, but only the jobs low on the food chain, and it will create more jobs to at least offset the jobs it does kill.I disagree. I think AI will kill jobs, and over time, AI might kill most “jobs” as we know them.

I think AI will kill jobs, and over time, AI might kill most “jobs” as we know them. I think that people are somewhat complacent in regard to the economic impact of AI, and will likely be ill-prepared for the changes we have to adapt to in the not-so-distant future.First, let's start with the comparisons to machinery and automation. They did indeed put factory workers out of work. In that respect, I agree AI today is similar in many applications, replacing workers who have less specialized skills, perhaps call center operators, office assistants (in a limited extent), and maybe soon, taxi drivers and truck drivers. But I would argue that AI is fundamentally different from machinery or most of the other analogies commonly made when answering this question, because AI is growing and is unlikely to stop growing. It's growing in breadth (of applications and industries), in geographic and economic scope, and in power (it's capacity to address increasingly complex tasks). A more fitting analogy would be machinery in an automobile plant that not only made the parts one day, but then learned how to assemble them the week after, and then how to design cars a year later.I think that there is little that is out of reach for advanced AI of the future. Let's leave the question of the AI singularity alone for now. Instead, I think that deep learning efforts at Google and elsewhere are making AI systems learn faster and faster, with a growing rate of acceleration. Advanced AI can now address increasingly complex tasks including medical diagnosis, stock market trading, weather prediction and human behavioral modeling. Very soon, it will be able to take the place of certain types of teachers, and find a role in education. It can already deal with complex systems in software and mathematics, and seems to be only limited in applications that require interactions with the physical world (sensors are still imperfect), and with people.So without projecting too far into the future, we can ask the question, what jobs will NOT be killed by AI? Jobs that involve labor are already (or soon to be) replaced. Jobs that require logical reasoning are being replaced, albeit at a slower rate. What are the qualities that humans have that cannot be captured by AI? Perhaps creativity, emotional responses? So perhaps researchers in academia will survive longer than most, and artists (though AI stylistic mimicry is already quite impressive and their results enjoyable), and counselors/psychologists/case workers, and decision makers like CEOs who cannot be predictable or error prone. And hopefully software engineers and algorithm designers who develop AI systems.This leaves a very, very small portion of today's jobs intact. Many say: we just need to train people to fill higher level jobs created by AI, e.g. Programmers, ML researchers. But this is no easy feat. The US educational system is struggling to meet the demands created by advanced technology today. This failure is in part responsible for the economic divide plaguing the country today. The challenge of educating the public for a job market that is both decreasing in scope and increasing in complexity, is nothing we've ever faced before.I am far from original in this opinion. But if I had to guess, I would say that AI will put far more people out of work than we can (re)train in time. That will have significant economic repercussions as corporations seeking to minimize cost will do so at the cost of rising unemployment. There will need to be dramatic changes in social policies in order to avert large scale economic disaster, first dramatic rises in minimum wage, then eventually some type of universal income/welfare. It's the kind of change that requires significant leadership in our government, something that seems woefully absent today.",0 followers,Cory Hicks,572,0,0,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-recent-and-upcoming-advancements-in-technology-related-to-dreaming
