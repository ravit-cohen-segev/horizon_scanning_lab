The rule of thumb that every tech company knows is that the one who manages to use the lowest possible technology for a given task wins.Besides, hat technology would you suggest for preventing access as an alternative to the physical barrier? Robotic machine guns? That’s not very humane and is fraught with all kind of mistakes with bad consequences.Any kind of barrier can be penetrated if it’s left to be passive.

Also, the goal is not to make the wall impenetrable, it’s to make the penetration economically inefficient.","9,355 followers",Jonathan Trueman,3.3K,7.6K,39.4M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Why-wont-Trump-agree-on-advanced-technology-rather-than-a-physical-barrier-The-government-has-physically-demonstrated-that-any-type-of-wall-can-be-cut-through-or-penetrated-They-physically-did-it
1,"Let's look on a smaller scale. Prisons. They always have walls and advanced technology to monitor. If a prisoner attempts to escape through a fence, the sensors will trigger. The fence will delay then long enough for authorities to intervene.The border wall is the same. It needs technology monitoring it for potential breaches so the border patrol can respond quickly. You cant have one without the other.",406 followers,Greg Nigh,1.3K,358,1.7M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Why-wont-Trump-agree-on-advanced-technology-rather-than-a-physical-barrier-The-government-has-physically-demonstrated-that-any-type-of-wall-can-be-cut-through-or-penetrated-They-physically-did-it
2,"In four billion years, Earth will have already been engulfed and consumed by the Red Giant Sun, so pretty much no effect.Edit: And yes, obviously there will be Solar cycles that will make the Earth uninhabitable long before 4 billion years from now.

3,"Well, let’s think about it for a bit.What kind of technologies have been invented in the last century?We have things like radar, and microwave, and the internet, and satellites and computer chips, and nuclear power, and canned food, and drones, and aviation technology, and GPS, and infant formula, and indexing of websites for search engines, and bar codes, and touch screens, and vaccines, and windpower, and the accelerometer, and fire resistant clothing, and aerodynamic trucks, airbags, miniature cameras that fit in a webcam or cellphone, weather forecasting, and submarines, cellular technologWell, let’s think about it for a bit.What kind of technologies have been invented in the last century?We have things like radar, and microwave, and the internet, and satellites and computer chips, and nuclear power, and canned food, and drones, and aviation technology, and GPS, and infant formula, and indexing of websites for search engines, and bar codes, and touch screens, and vaccines, and windpower, and the accelerometer, and fire resistant clothing, and aerodynamic trucks, airbags, miniature cameras that fit in a webcam or cellphone, weather forecasting, and submarines, cellular technology and networks, RAM memory, hard disk drives, liquid-crystal displays, lithium batteries, so on.But all that kind of stuff was developed by having governments getting involved, funding research and science and so on.Which, as we all know, is a really inefficient method, it pretty much doesn’t work.Instead of this inefficient method that clearly doesn’t work, of having governments take part in research and development, we now have a much better strategy for innovation:Random guys in their garage!As we all know, that’s where all the true innovation comes from, random middle class dudes, who have ideas, and then do a startup in their garage.Either that, or huge corporations who invest in ways to extend their patents.So now, we have much more groundbreaking innovation.We have things like Amazon, who patented and made a fortune off one-click buying, the truly revolutionary idea of not making people click more than needed.Do you really think that government could have ever come up with a brilliant idea like that, huh?",18 followers,Asim Qureshi,12.7K,996,156M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Why-wont-Trump-agree-on-advanced-technology-rather-than-a-physical-barrier-The-government-has-physically-demonstrated-that-any-type-of-wall-can-be-cut-through-or-penetrated-They-physically-did-it

A perp shall be impaled.No technology can work without faith. A church complex is located on the other side of the street from the high tech shovel.The ground floor has a church shop selling icons and crosses, young programmers like to put on the processors and glue to computer displays to make magic.Unfortunately the fence is crooked like everything/everyone else in this country and has to be propped up with…rails.The asphalt and curbs are brand new though (and changed every year) - mayor Sobyanin’s takes his cut, and municipal authorities get their 15% kickback.You are not allowed to bring your own candles to the chapel. God wants you to buy them in the church shop.On the other side from the church complex is a school behind a very tall iron fence with the monument of a Red Army soldier holding a sub machine gun. We are not afraid of Turkish drones - our heroes will shoot them down because out technologies are the best.","68,777 followers",Kanthaswamy Balasubramaniam,898,17.3K,413.3M,2021,https://www.quora.com/In-4-billion-years-if-we-have-a-solar-flare-what-will-happen-to-our-extremely-advanced-technology
