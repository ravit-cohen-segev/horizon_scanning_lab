And yeah, they’re a hell of a lot better than fighting somebody without one.But, here’s the thing about powered exoskeletons: the person within the exoskeleton limits the exoskeleton’s capabilities. Suddenly, the exoskeleton has to account for a person’s heat tolerance, the types of forces a person can withstand, a person’s range of motion… It’s a mess.Wouldn’t it just be smarter to design a robot instead of an exoskeleton, and man it remotely? Not only would you be able to build a far sPowered exoskeletons…“I am ze Rhino!”Sure, powered exoskeletons look pretty damn cool. I won’t argue there.

Is it just about the money for you or you want a job which allows you to grow as a person/professional?If you really want to live in India then, IIMs are a good option.

If you planning to taje an educational loan then going to abroad is not a good option. Because the pay in india is in general less than that in foreign. So you need to atleast spend 6 to 8 years in clearing your loan if your abroad college.",14 followers,Sanyam Gupta,656,101,560.2K,2014,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-good-websites-on-science-and-technology
