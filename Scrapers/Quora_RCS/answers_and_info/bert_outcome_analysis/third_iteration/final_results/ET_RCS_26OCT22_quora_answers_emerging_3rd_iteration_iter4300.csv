5,"Mostly it’s because every time “the world” thinks it needs a policeman, it calls the United States.Yes, that’s a bit glib and simplistic, but it’s also true. Just listen whenever some catastrophe which requires something like a “world policeman” happens. You start hearing stuff like, “When is the US going to stop this?” “Why hasn’t the US done anything yet?” “How can the US just stand by and let this happen?”Personally, as a citizen of the US and a veteran of the US armed forces, I’d be absolutely thrilled if some of the other major powers in the world decided to start pulling their weight.","91,619 followers",Roland Bartetzko,6.7K,3.5K,314.7M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-scenarios-in-which-a-single-revolutionary-military-weapon-technology-tactic-or-asymmetric-strategy-could-result-in-the-United-States-decisively-and-permanently-losing-its-status-as-the-worlds

7,"Stealth technology is not useless, it is just not as useful as the US thinks it is. When US stealth technology made its debut in Desert Storm, Soviet leaders were shocked by its effectiveness. American F-117s were able to sneak deep behind Iraqi lines and bomb targets with impunity. Night after night throughout the course of the war, F-117s bombed command and control centers deep in the heart of BStealth technology is not useless, it is just not as useful as the US thinks it is. When US stealth technology made its debut in Desert Storm, Soviet leaders were shocked by its effectiveness. American F-117s were able to sneak deep behind Iraqi lines and bomb targets with impunity. Night after night throughout the course of the war, F-117s bombed command and control centers deep in the heart of Baghdad, air defense installations spread throughout the country and strategic infrastructure like bridges and power plants covered by some of Iraq’s most potent air defenses. All told. F-117s flew 1,300 sorties and attacked 40% of the strategic targets in the Gulf War.F-117However, stealth aircraft like the F-117 are only optimized against certain frequencies. Historically, missiles have had to rely high-resolution radars that utilize beams with wavelengths measured in centimeters and millimeters to target stealth aircraft. These frequencies are known as the SHF and EHF bands, respectively. These SHF and EHF band radars are better at estimating the speed and location of non-stealth targets than radars that utilize longer wavelengths, therefore they can guide missiles more accurately. Stealth aircraft are optimized against targets in these bands, making it difficult to get a weapons-quality track on them.No sooner than the dust had cleared over Baghdad did the Russians/Soviets begin work on counters to the US’s stealth technology. The Russians immediately recognized that stealth aircraft had relatively poor performance against radars with wavelengths measured in meters or decimeters, operating in the VHF and UHF bands respectively. Modern stealth aircraft rely on honeycomb type structures in the aircraft skin to trap radar waves. However, these longer wavelength radars produce beams that are too long to get trapped in these structures. Additionally, they have a tendency to resonate off of defining features on the aircraft like the engine inlets or vertical or horizontal stabilizers, that are up to 10x the length of the radar that is observing them, producing a sizable return. Consequently, these radars are able to observe stealth aircraft with relative ease.Nebo VHF-band AESA Radar Used in the S-400However, historically these radars have suffered from poor resolution. UHF and VHF band radars have only been able to track targets within a few hundred meters, making them unsuitable for guiding missiles. Nevertheless, as the computer revolution has progressed, signal processing techniques have been developed that allow UHF and VHF radars to far more accurately fix the location of aircraft, making them more suitable for missile guidance. The Russians have been able to develop radars like the Nebo VHF-band radar utilized in the S-400 that are capable of providing a weapons quality track or at the very least guiding a missile with an infra-red seeker to within a range, where it can autonomously locate and target an aircraft. As a result, radars have advanced to a point where aircraft like the F-117 would no longer be able to survive to perform missions like the ones they performed in Desert Storm.E-2D Advanced HawkeyeThat being said, stealth technology is not totally useless. Radars like the Nebo radar used in the S-400 are enormous. They are simply too large to fit into most aircraft, aside from AWACS aircraft like the American Northrop Grumman E-2D and the Russian Beriev A-100. The E-2D utilizes an UHF-band radar, which has proven capable of guiding SM-6 missiles. Nevertheless, these radars are far too large to fit into most fighter, which are still largely dependent on radars in the SHF and VHF bands. Radars require a number of antennas to be able to effectivel...",0 followers,Nor Reza,5.5K,8.6K,50.6M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-scenarios-in-which-a-single-revolutionary-military-weapon-technology-tactic-or-asymmetric-strategy-could-result-in-the-United-States-decisively-and-permanently-losing-its-status-as-the-worlds
8,"In my opinion, it’s more likely that the US military is still underrated, even by people who say that it’s by far the most powerful military force in the world.Many people do not understand that the US has not just a bigger-sized military than anyone else but that with this size, they also gained capabilities that nobody else has:In my opinion, it’s more likely that the US military is still underrated, even by people who say that it’s by far the most powerful military force in the world.Many people do not understand that the US has not just a bigger-sized military than anyone else but that with this size, they also gained capabilities that nobody else has:I think that this is the strongest point of the US military: their logistics. You can have as many troops and weapons as you want; they are useless if you do not have the logistics to transport and supply them.In addition to this, when you have ten times the military force of another country, you are not just ten times stronger than them but many times more. In military thinking, personnel and material do not add up but they are more like multiplying factors: three plus three makes nine.While every other military in the world has rather simple missions, mostly to defend their country, the US National Security Strategy demands that the US military is always prepared to conduct “Two and a half wars” at the same time.A good example is when in the late 1990s, the US was simultaneously engaged in three places that were (or threatened to become) major conflicts:They did all these things at the same time and although it demanded a lot of cooperation, they pulled it off without a problem. There’s no other military in the world that would be capable to complete even half of these tasks.",21 followers,Timothy Singleton,4.1K,3.1K,3.9M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-scenarios-in-which-a-single-revolutionary-military-weapon-technology-tactic-or-asymmetric-strategy-could-result-in-the-United-States-decisively-and-permanently-losing-its-status-as-the-worlds

Human enhancement of this nature raises a massive host of ethical issues.But again, things change.I don't know if this will lead to the Singularity that people like Ray Kurzweil talk about.
