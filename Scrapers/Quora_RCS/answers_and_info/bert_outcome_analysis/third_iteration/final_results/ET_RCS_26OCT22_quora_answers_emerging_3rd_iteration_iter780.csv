At the time of its loss in the shipwreck, the device was pretty old, believed to have been in use for at least 60 years. The device, made of brass, has a number of moving parts and dials like a clock that when operated would describe the motion of the planets and the moon on certain dates. It was made in Greece and uses a level of multiple technologies thought not possible at the time including precision metallurgy, screws, toothed gears, gradation of dials, precision metal construction and so on. It wouldn’t be until about 1453 that any comparable technology would be re-invented in the use of mechanical clocks and most of these were made out of carved wood because the precision metallurgy and construction needed to make them was rare or non-existent (John Harrison’s church clocks made in the 1700s were made entirely of wood including the self-lubricating lignum-vitae and still tell accurate time today).ElectroplatingWhile modern electroplating goes back to 1805 based on the 1799 invention of the voltaic pile, or “battery” as we call it today, it has been shown that it is possible that ancient Persians (today, Iranians) were using electroplating as early as 224 BC. The device has been shown in modern times on numerous occasions to be capable of electroplating objects if grape juice and a ground-up beetle were used to create a weak electric current. Although experiments have shown this to be possible, there are many missing elements that would have been needed including drawn copper or gold wire, insulators and connectors. So there is still some doubt about it as an electroplating machine. In addition, there are no known electroplated objects extant from that period so there is no product that demonstrates the machine was used or even possible. This information suggests the knowledge and use of electricity which wasn’t commonly known to exist until Ben Franklin proved it in 1752 showing that lightning was actually electricity. From there, a torrent of discoveries were made by Volta, Faraday and others.Stone ToolsStone tools were among the first man-made manufactured objects but it requires a loosely defined definition of “man”. Some of these tools go back to about 1.7 million years and some even further. One of the oldest is the Tanzanian Oldowan tool “industry” (in this use, the word “industry” has a different meaning than we use it on a regular basis). In addition, this was followed by the more complex Acheulean tool industry in France about the same time period. The ancients used stone tools for cutting, pounding and scraping and sought out particular types of stone for the way they broke at certain fracture points, one of the most desirable being obsidian, one of the most common being flint. Today, the sharpest blades in the world are still made of obsidian which can be sharpened to single molecule thickness on the edge.Of course everyone talks of Hero’s Aeliopile or early steam engines. These machines were for demonstration and never did any kind of useful work.There is an opposite and associated question, which technologies are NEWER than they appear and this is equally fascinating.People take for granted certain things such as the “chimney”. While the chimney seems pretty simple to us, the first use of residential chimneys wasn’t until a king in England put one in his castle in 1185 with a smoke hood to evacuate the smoke from his Great Room. Until then, large campfires were made right on the stone (or dirt) floor and the smoke escaped from the windows. It was a horrible price to pay for heat. Even then, residential chimneys in houses were not common until the 1600s. The Pilgrims coming to America had no chimneys in their homes - just a hole in the roof to allow smoke to escape. Certain laws were passed requiring “mud daubing” in homes to prevent sparks from setting the wood on fire. When the first chimney was invented, in the castle in Yorkshire it was the wonder of the age and people and scientists came from all over to investigate the modern invention and its obvious improvement over the current method of allowing the house to fill with smoke just to get heat. Note that building a chimney that drafts properly is not just a matter of stacking stone in a cylinder but requires other elements to make it work efficiently.Another more “modern” invention we take for granted today is the fireplace fire grate. This simple device was invented in 1678 in Germany by Prince Rupert and was a major step forward in heating. All at once, it lifted the fire off the floor and allowed enveloping ventilation that produced more fire, more heat, less smoke and more light. By the 1700s, this was still considered “advanced technology” but homes everywhere implemented all manner of fire grates and cranes and cooking implements to take advantage of the fire grate.Another technology that is much newer than most people think is the “fork”. While it was invented in Turkey in about 450 AD it was rarely used, thought to be an affectation of homosexuals and was banned by the church for awhile as blasphemy, since god gave us “fingers”. It was not until the world’s first tourist, an Englishman by the name Thomas Coryat who traveled Europe and wrote a “blog” of his adventures. He brought the fork to England in 1611 and after awhile it became the plaything of the elite, and each guest brought his own fork in a special box. In those days, forks had only two tines. The four-tine fork we know today did not come into common usage until the mid-1800s.",6 followers,Ann Edelman,6.3K,0,0,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-could-be-the-next-technological-age-beyond-the-computer-and-the-jet-age

In the last 5 years or so, it’s been slowly dawning on us that more technology, by itself, cannot be the solution, and in fact, the systems we currently have in place, while they solve some problems, create other problems that may be equally severe.While technology has certainly lifted many humans out of poverty and enriched our lives in many ways, it has also made the world increasingly complex and difficult to navigate. The rapid disruption of many established industries has meant that even the most intelligent and conscientious individuals have had to struggle to stay relevant in the modern globalized economy—while others, inundated with information to make sense of, can’t figure out how to make all the right decisions the first time, and must spend years broke, jobless, underemployed, or burnt out. We are not weaker or stupider than our ancestors, but the world is more challenging than ever before and we need to go through more trial and error than they did in order to secure a comfortable existence. Continued technological development will increase material abundance even more, but technology alone cannot solve the problem of figuring out whom to distribute resources to and getting everyone on board with how resources are distributed.The internet has enabled new modes of social interaction that the evolution of our primate brains didn’t equip us to handle. Despite the fact that we are supposed to be more connected than ever before, many people are lonely and starved of genuine positive human attention. Many people don’t belong to “tribes” or “bands” in which individuals are valued, the way our ancestors have for millennia; instead, we all compete for attention on a globalized market provided by social media, and many people are losing the competition, becoming lonely and depressed, while even those who are winning, receiving a larger share of positive attention than others, can often be anxious and insecure about maintaining their position in the status hierarchy, because they, too, often lack a close-knit social group in which people genuinely care about them. Economic growth and technological development don’t increase the ratio of available human attention to the amount of need for human attention (as both scale linearly with the number of humans alive). We have to admit that we simply don’t know how to solve this problem right now, but at any rate, it’s obvious that we can’t rely on technology to be our savior.I believe that in order to confront the major problems that we will face this century, we are going to have to look inward and confront some uncomfortable truths about human nature, understand the fact that technology can amplify both the best and the worst aspects of it, and possibly come together to make big sacrifices in order to build a world that’s truly better for all of us.

Because radiation from nuclear accidents is apparently scarier than way more people dying of regular pollution constantly and the total annihilation of all life on Earth as the oceans boil away.",0 followers,Priyan Bopitiya,4.7K,269,7.2M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-next-technology-you-want-to-see-in-a-car

And If you think you can make the needle in your home.Now let me explainMechanical engineering is the discipline that includes/ involves/ combines/ overlapsmore than 30 disciplines.Future of Mechanical engineeringElectric VehiclesReplacement of the traditional internal combustion engine with cleaner, battery-powered systems brings new challenges regarding torque and energy loss, and the design of mechatronics to support new electrical system.Furthermore, as vehicle manufacturing becomes more automated, mechanical engineers will be front and centre in the design of robotics andNanoengineeringNanotechnology refers to the manipulation of materials at the smallest level. This rapidly growing field is one that offers abundant opportunities for mechanical engineers.In the years ahead, mechanical engineers are expected to be integral in using nanotechnology to:BiomechatronicsThe role of mechanical engineers in robotics is taken a step even further with the rapid growth of biomechatronics. This field, which seeks to merge body and machine, involves the design and testing of complex and intricate device architectures that mimic the body’s musculoskeletal design.Mechanical engineers will be primarily involved in the design of mechanical sensors, controllers, and actuators for biomedical devicesManufacturingManufacturing is an ever-evolving field. Mounting pressures to increase production efficiency while minimizing operating costs have fueled demand for new and innovative technologies.Automation and roboticsNon-of the engineering is dead end...Edit:1.0For people in the comment section asking the reason for high unemployment for Mechanical Engineers. To answer the questionThe Problem of unemployment is not only with Mechanical Engineers, but with the whole Industrial Sector.A lot of Electrical Engineers and Electronics Engineers are working in IT Services like TCS, Infosys, Wipro, CTS, IBM etc.Many Civil and Mechanical Engineers are either working in Banking Services or pursuing Teaching in Coaching Classes.Some are selling Credit CardsFortunate Ones are going to US, Germany, Netherland to pursue M.S.The reason for this is, after Independence Indian economy has shifted gradually from Agriculture Sector to Service Sector (be it formal or Informal) leavingAccordingly the Share of Workforce in the Industrial Sector also remained Stagnant.However, Total no of Engineering graduates each year has risen drastically leaving many graduates unemployed.As per National Employability report engineers annual report 2019, Approximately 80 percent of Indian engineering graduates are not employable in the current knowledge-driven economy. This signify the pathetic condition of engineering education in India. Some major initiative in the direction of quality of education, is the need of the hour.What are Future Prospects of Industrial SectorIt has already been perceived our Government that Industrial & Manufacturing growth is the best route for overall economic development.Make In India, Skill Development, Start-up India, Stand-up India, Entrepreneurship Skill Development Program are some of the examples.Under Make in India thrust sectors have been identified to provide a push to manufacturing and Start-up India to strengthen the start-up ecosystem.The Ease of Doing Business initiative aims to create a conducive environment by streamlining existing regulations and processes and eliminating unnecessary requirements and procedures.Foreign Direct Investment policy and procedures have been simplified and liberalised progressively.Hope Future Industrial Sector is Bright, Everyone will be Employed !.Thank you Ayana Vini for pointing this out..Edit-2.0For people contending that the rate of innovation in Computer Science and Electronics is much higher and there is very less innovation in Mechanical engineering.I agree that the rate of innovation in computer science and electronics is far than the mechanical engineering.I totally agree.However, There is a world beyond the computer too. We can not eat data, we can not wear motherboard and we can not brush our teeth with a transistor & we can not drive a mouse.What i mean to say that for the innovations in computer science and electronics to use practically we always have to have a base. Where will we use those innovations ?? We will use these innovation in electronics over a car, or robot, or drone or rocket or spaceship or aeroplane , helicopter, fighter plane or any other equipment which must have a chance of using Mechanical engineering and we can witness the innovations in these technologies, can’t we?The rate of innovations in computer science and electronics is higher because these are new for the humanity. Both came into existence in the later 20th century and innovation has just picked up in the last decade. Hence, everything is new for us and we are able to perceive the little changes in it. Like after every 6 months we see a new smart phone with some new technology. There are millions of Applications releasing everyday. It looks quite fascinating to us, isn’t it ?However, we have been unable to see the innovations in materials. We don’t know about carbon fiber. We have ignored these innovations in Biomechanics.AWe have no idea about innovation in the field of Fluid dynamics because we can not feel it.There are innovations in mechanical Engineering too.The world is dreaming about a flying car, an smart robot, smart machines, and smart materials.There are huge innovation in nanotechnology, robotics, biomechanics going on.And i hope that in the NEXT EPIDEMIC like CORONA virus our worriers will be smart robots equipped with artificial intelligence ( off course credit goes to computer science), who will be carrying the infected to the hospitals and operating them.And in the coming time biotechnology is going to take over both Computer Science and Electronics Engineering as world has started witnessing biological warfare.Where as Mechanical Engineering will keep growing with the slow pace like a tortoise!Regards,ReferenceImage Source -phone gallery & GoogleMechanical engineering - Wikipedia4 Things to Expect for the Future of Mechanical Engineeringhttps://www.gedcouncil.org/sites/default/files/Engineering+Education+in+India+Dec1608-1.pdfDATA STORY | 80% of Indian engineering graduates not employable, says surveyIndia struggles but Bangladesh's GDP rides high on manufacturing, export boomKey Initiatives for Industrial Development Post GST and Demonetisation",240 followers,Mayur Sinkar,901,106,160.9K,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-next-technology-you-want-to-see-in-a-car
24,"I'll give you a concrete answer. I don't want to give a vague answer with sugar coating or wired fan boy answer. After you have read my answer , you will end up with a much better perspective.1. Go for MTech only if you wish to get into teaching or Research (PhD)Unless you do your MTech from IIT or IISC, chances are, the only door an MTech will open for you is Teaching or Research. Most folks feel that an MTech in Mech will increase their chances at good profiles in core companies. Lies, when it comes to Mechanical Engineering, experience beats advanced degree 9/10 times.2. MS (Only if it's USI'll give you a concrete answer. I don't want to give a vague answer with sugar coating or wired fan boy answer. After you have read my answer , you will end up with a much better perspective.1.

Most folks feel that an MTech in Mech will increase their chances at good profiles in core companies. Lies, when it comes to Mechanical Engineering, experience beats advanced degree 9/10 times.2. MS (Only if it's USA or Germany )Unlike India, USA and Germany have a strong manufacturing Industry, India has been fashioning itself into more of a Software/IT hub.So, going for your master's in US or Alemagne, will probably help you more to get into a specialised industry role than an MTech will do so here.3. Work at a core companyThe respect you will get from your batch mates and teachers will be immense if you get into a core company in a core profile. Reason being simple, most Mech folks end up in IT. You being in you branch will garner immense respect , not only from the above-mentioned people but also other potential recruiters. Shift from one core company to another is much easier than from IT to Core (not impossible).4. Work in an IT/Analytics/Non-core companyWe all need to work for a living, there is nothing wrong with that. If you do not get a job in a core company, it's stupidity to rejecte all other jobs waiting for that one ideal job.5. Go for an MBAI know many mech engineers who were very ordinary at their Mech subjects or jobs but ended up being rockstars of economics, Investment Banking, marketing and business development.6. Civil Services/UPSCOne of the greatest Engineers of India, was also one of its best administrators, Sir M Visvesvaraya. Other famous administrators are Jairam Ramesh, Manohar Parrikar etc.7.
