This is theAI / MLThese technologies are about making applications or software systems learn by themselves after an initial “training” period. It is akin to holding a child learn walk on a row of single bricks. We tell him where to step on and where not to. Each mistake is corrected or “punished” with a tender slap instantaneously and every correct step is rewarded. Based on this knowledge, the child can repeat the exercise on various terrains independently.Obviously, the above is an oversimplified example for ease of understanding but this involves complex neural network algorithms which need to be trained and let make correct decisions in the future. Although many software aids like TensorFlow are available in the market, the technology does have a steep-learning curve to learn & master it.IoTBlockchainDepending on your ability to pick-up these technologies, you can decide which ones to pursue. If you are sure can pick up any of them, including complex ones, I would suggest that you learn AI/ML, which has maximum potential in the future. Next would be blockchain, both in terms of complexity to learn as well as potential in the future.Big Data would be the easiest to pick up but there would more crowded market, in terms of talent. In my personal opinion, BigData is personal space (B2C) will start dwindling and IoT combined with BigData make more sustainable trend.As a cybersecurity professional, I cannot end this response without saying that there is going to be a burst of multiple unforeseeable attacks which also require highly advanced cybersecurity skills for corporates and governments alike.Wishing you the very best future!",16 followers,Daniel Bourke,6.9K,178,7.7M,2019,https://www.quora.com/How-big-of-a-threat-to-NFL-gate-revenue-is-emerging-technology
2,"All of these technologies are compliment to each other and work in tandem with one another in digital transformation of client businesses. IoT is almost toothless without AI. Cloud/AWS/Hadoop provides that power and a lot of other benefits for AI and IOT to function properly.

But it also depends on a lot of other factors. It depends on your background. It depends on your interests, a path for your smooth transition. You already have 10 years of experience which means that you are moulded in a certain way. Which also means that now if you need to remould, there would be some constraints. So, you look at your career background and interests and accordingly go for whatever is suitable.","31,157 followers",Phillip Remaker,1.7K,11K,78.8M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Whats-the-best-emerging-technology-to-learn-in-India-with-10-years-of-IT-experience-AI-IOT-AWS-Hadoop-Blockchain
3,"Whilst it's unlikely that any area of Computing will be entirely replaced by AI in our lifetimes, blockchain is a specialist niche with limited application. It's not a suitable basis for a career.Learn software engineering and computer science.

4,"A bloody enormous Combustion Light Gas gun.(Picture not of CLG gun)These guns use hydrogen and oxygen gases as a propellant. Hydrogen is much lighter and stronger than regular cannon propellant, which gives CLG guns muzzle velocities in excess of 7km/s. For comparison, railguns give a maximum muzzle velocity of around 4 km/s, and regular guns struggle to do 1.8. This quite frankly insane muzzle velocity gives CLG guns hypothetical ranges well in excess of 200 kilometres. When pared with rocket-assisted ammunition, a CLG gun could likely reach much further than this.

When pared with rocket-assisted ammunition, a CLG gun could likely reach much further than this. Mounted on ships, these guns could replace anti-ship missiles, being much harder to defend against, much cheaper per shot and much quicker to hit the target. Ships could even make propellant on-site, since oxygen and hydrogen can be produced by water electrolysis. The gases could then be cryogenically frozen for storage on the ship. The only real vulnerability of CLG guns is that the stored gases are vulnerable to cookoff if the ship is hit, and that can be solved with blowout panels. Such guns, if utilised properly by the world’s navies, could cause a resurgence in the battleship, and drastically improve modern artillery capabilities.",0 followers,Alex Johnston,707,13K,104.7M,1999,https://www.quora.com/How-big-of-a-threat-to-NFL-gate-revenue-is-emerging-technology
5,"I was about to log this as a SFQ, but the reason aders are clearly all scifi reading fruitloops. As I read scifi, I guess that makes me part fruitloop myself.I would suggest nanotechnology used in a recombinant manner - dispersed until it needs to be together. Whatever you use it for, having something there that you can't see but that could make your day very bad indeed would make for a great story.","2,522 followers",Martin Vratny,1.7K,2.9K,9.8M,2003,https://www.quora.com/Whats-the-best-emerging-technology-to-learn-in-India-with-10-years-of-IT-experience-AI-IOT-AWS-Hadoop-Blockchain
6,"Finding just the right frequency and directed power (in the microwave arena) to detonate explosive powders at a distance.You could render an enemy’s guns and artillery useless. An aerial drone flying overhead could incapacitate an enemy who carries sidearms or grenades (or even IEDs) into a war zone.When a frenzied mob brandishing guns swarms into a town square, a drone could blow apart their weapons (and bodies) in a single pass.Close combat would be split between swords, bows & arrows, and ray guns, and wouldn’t that be fun to see?",113 followers,Abhimanyu Sood,1K,200,25.5M,2003,https://www.quora.com/Whats-the-best-emerging-technology-to-learn-in-India-with-10-years-of-IT-experience-AI-IOT-AWS-Hadoop-Blockchain
