The radar horizon hasn’t changed; the radar and processing power are much better than 40 years ago I would conclude that the latest radar can detect and track the legacy stealth aircraft. The newest stealth aircraft would still be behind the curve of the most advanced radar detection system!.Try to think back to the 1980’s remember your IBM PC; the floppy disk and display now compare that to your grand baby’s brand new tablet!Radar technology has evolved especially in the signal processing power! You might say all of that processing power would weight tons. For AWAC, warships and long range ground based Radar there is plenty of room but in the last few years we’re only talking about the computing power of a high end laptop not a baseball park full of 1980’s electronics equipment!Look up the USAF’s SAGE of the 60’s!

1,"The same way it has in the past. If, 200 years ago, you had said, “Call me” to someone as you were parting, they would have wondered what to call you. Today we know what it means (in the US, anyway).“Can you drive me?” didn’t mean anything in 1850.“What’s on tonight?” is becoming less and less meaningful, as more and more people can watch a whole series at once if they choose to.How language will change depends on how technology changes, and we’re not very good at forecasting that. (In 2004, no one was predicting smartphones. Three years later we had iPhones.)",1 follower,Oscar Tay,1.3K,641,14.4M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Why-hasnt-radar-technology-evolved-in-the-last-few-decades-to-detect-stealth-jets-while-stealth-technology-improved-quite-a-lot
2,"No.In order for this to realistically happen the whole world would have to become a single speech community. This isn't going to happen.For one case study:Dialect leveling in American English dialects has been reversing itself since the mid 20th century. The most commonly attributed reason for AmE dialect leveling was that people were moving for work. Speech communities became very disrupted by newcomers from other dialect areas. After the Great Depression ended this trend slowed down. It still happens, but we don't have millions of people moving to a different state when the economy gets baNo.In order for this to realistically happen the whole world would have to become a single speech community.

There's the Northern Cities Vowel Shift, California Vowel Shift, Canadian Raising, and numerous other changes in progress.Language varieties only die really when their speakers no longer pass them on. Dialect leveling really only happens when speech communities change.Neither of these things is likely to result from increased communication technology.

3,"A simple answer would be that since so much tech and software is produced in English, as well as much entertainment, then English might become the universal common language. However, even though languages still die as do their speakers, there is no indication that languages spoken by significant populations are in any risk of disappearing. Indeed, languages originally of single origin, such as English, Spanish, etc, that are spoken in different countries or even regions, continue to diverge from the original, just as Latin turned into a multiplicity of languages.

However, even though languages still die as do their speakers, there is no indication that languages spoken by significant populations are in any risk of disappearing. Indeed, languages originally of single origin, such as English, Spanish, etc, that are spoken in different countries or even regions, continue to diverge from the original, just as Latin turned into a multiplicity of languages. Further, increasing facility of instant, automatic translation into any alternative language is most likely to perpetuate the existence of that variety of languages. And AI will no doubt further enhance idiomatic translation. Therefore, the most likely effect of technology is to enable instantaneous, automatic, idiomatic translation that leaves regional languages to evolve and continue to be used as they would have had there been no communication technology. Perhaps the only additional effect may be a greater incursion of words from other languages that are often encountered, especially if their meaning is not susceptible to a simple translation, e.g. gestalt, panache, etc.","246,865 followers",Dushka Zapata,1.5K,8.5K,232.5M,2021,https://www.quora.com/How-will-our-use-of-language-change-as-communication-technology-evolves

And I bless the technology that allows me to easily explore the world wherever I step and buy airplane tickets that cost me less than parking my car in the airport while I’m away.3. DignityEven as a member of a tiny privileged minority, in my capacity of a Soviet propaganda executive, back in the 1980s I traveled across Europe with the chip of a poor, fearful Soviet citizen on my shoulder. The 5,700 kroner of my untaxable monthly allowance was worth at least four or five times that amount earned by a Scandinavian native at the time. Adjusted for deductibles—taxes, free apartment and utilities, free car, free petrol, the untaxed groceries in the embassy shop etc—a very, very comfortable lump of money at the time.And yet, the value of Western currency back home was so immense that spending every krone of it felt like paying with my own blood.The moment I laid hands on my own 1,000 kroner for the first time, I realized how poor we all were in the USSR. The last bum in the street in Stockholm could immediately spend a fist of his panhandled coins on things that even the top guys in the Politburo could only buy in the “Section 200″.

These men rose to very senior ranks within British intelligence, and did so much damage that the Americans almost never trusted UK intelligence again.However, those agents were persuaded to betray their country because in those days the USSR had a lot of prestige, first as a workers paradise (it was actually a brutal dictatorship ruled by terror, but Stalin succeeded in deceiving most westerners) and then as the hammer and sickle that broke the Nazis.However, as the Cold War progressed, as various uprisings were crushed with great brutality, the USSR lost this veneer of heroism, and the KGB were never again able to recruit traitors from the idealistic, elitist young. A few individual traitors, Vassall, Prime, Bettany for example but these were all men with personality issues who never reached positions of high responsibility, unlike Philby, Burgess and MacLean.Whereas, MI6 was having increasing success penetrating the USSR. First Oleg Penkovsky, who supplied the info that Kennedy needed to outwit Krushchev during the Cuban Missile Crisis, then later Oleg Gordievsky, who became KGB bureau chief in London and supplied the British with secrets for twelve years. Both were eventually betrayed, by Jack Dunlap and Aldrich Ames respectively. Penkovsky was executed. Gordievsky was rescued by MI6 from under the noses of the KGB in Moscow, and is still alive living in exile in the UK.TL:DR In the early years of the Cold War the KGB pretty much owned MI6, however the British were able to recover and by the late Cold War to some extent turned the tables.","43,448 followers",Misha Firer,696,1.3K,133.8M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-examples-of-periods-in-the-past-when-sets-of-existing-laws-and-regulations-were-tested-made-less-relevant-or-forced-to-evolve-update-because-of-new-technologies-or-service-innovations-as-with-Airbnb-Uber-Spotify-others-today
