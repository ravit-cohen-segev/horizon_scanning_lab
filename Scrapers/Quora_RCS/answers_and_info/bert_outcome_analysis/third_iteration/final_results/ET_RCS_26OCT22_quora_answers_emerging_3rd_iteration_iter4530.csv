1,"The big if is nuclear weapons. My guess is that if Nazi Germany has embarked on a serious nuclear program - it would have been nuked first as a precautionary measure. There are claims that Nazi Germany did detonate a nuclear device, in Thuringia, of all places, but i do not find that credible. Ina discussion on this topic, I got a reply from somebody who claimed that Germany had developed centrifuge technology to enable them to produce fissile material much more quickly and with far less expense. If so, why was centrifuge technology not adopted immediately after the war? In short, I think theThe big if is nuclear weapons.

I don‚Äôt see a game changer or a war winner anywhere. Operation Bernhard was a major inconvenience, but no more than that. The wonder weapons, primarily the V1 and V2, had limited range and minimal accuracy. Jet aircraft? The Allies had them, too. The fact is the the only jet fighters available were the Me 262 and He 162, both of which had problems. The other designs never really got off the drawing board, and were mostly speculative, apart from the Ho 229.The big issue was industrial capacity and access to natural resources. The USA had far more of both, Germany was running short of both..So, no chance of success.",0 followers,Brent Cooper,6.2K,7.9K,409.8M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Had-Nazi-Germany-perfected-their-unfinished-technologies-fighter-jets-nuclear-weapons-etc-and-devised-plans-e-g-Operation-Bernhard-in-complete-secrecy-before-they-engaged-in-WW2-would-they-have-any-chance-of-success
2,"Not necessarily. The allies also build new technology. The British were working on jet engines. The Americans worked on, and eventually made, nuclear weapons. The B-29 was the most advanced bomber of its day.","91,617 followers",Roland Bartetzko,569,3.5K,314.7M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Had-Nazi-Germany-perfected-their-unfinished-technologies-fighter-jets-nuclear-weapons-etc-and-devised-plans-e-g-Operation-Bernhard-in-complete-secrecy-before-they-engaged-in-WW2-would-they-have-any-chance-of-success
3,"Nuclear weapons by no later than 1943 then yes. I mean if you give them everything and early enough but with their current bombers or heavy lift aircraft in 1943 they could still reach Moscow, Leningrad and London. Suicide submarines could take out New York or Boston.","3,969 followers",Rafael Cavacchini,9.5K,427,8.3M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Had-Nazi-Germany-perfected-their-unfinished-technologies-fighter-jets-nuclear-weapons-etc-and-devised-plans-e-g-Operation-Bernhard-in-complete-secrecy-before-they-engaged-in-WW2-would-they-have-any-chance-of-success
4,Absolutely. What would have been a guaranteed war winner would be their development of an Atomic Bomb. Albert Speer never understood it and gave it a low priority.

5,"No. the physical distance of America from Europe and America‚Äôs rich raw materials plus our huge industrial base meant that even if Germany had all the Wonder Weapons in the world they still would not have defeated the US. Germany never had the industrial might nor the foresight needed to win the war really. There were so many splinters on what war goods to produce that prioritizing manufacture of them was not feasible. And don‚Äôt forget, they had a drug addled megalomaniac at the helm. He didn‚Äôt listen to his best generals even when a victory might have been possible in a conventional war.

He didn‚Äôt listen to his best generals even when a victory might have been possible in a conventional war. For instance the Me-262 which could have been a real PITA to the Allied Air Forces was originally put to use as a front line bomber because Hitler thought it would be most effective that way. Both the V-1 and V-2 were basically unguided weapons that did much less damage than they could have if they had better guidance systems. Again, Hitler pushed them into use before they were actually ready. As for Operation Bernhard, that would have been near impossible. The British quickly discovered that the notes were fake and really, dropping money from the sky to collapse an economy. That was the kind of fanciful thinking that went on by those wishing to curry favor with Hitler. There were even experiments in alchemy, trying to turn other metals into gold.So with all the scurrying around hoping to find that true ‚ÄúWonder Weapon‚Äù that would decisively win the war, Germany wasted a lot of time, energy and man hours on technologies that were at best only theoretical at the time.",655 followers,Matt Kamson,965,413,5.3M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Had-Nazi-Germany-perfected-their-unfinished-technologies-fighter-jets-nuclear-weapons-etc-and-devised-plans-e-g-Operation-Bernhard-in-complete-secrecy-before-they-engaged-in-WW2-would-they-have-any-chance-of-success
