There were two main reasons I made that decision:After seven years in academia and at the age of 29, I was still aSecondly, I was starting to lose faith in academia. The academic publishing system is, in my opinion, broken. The link between publishing and quality of work has been eroded, and it’s more beneficial to publish lots of rubbish than a smaller quantity of fantastic and insightful science. At the same time, the need to constantly apply for more grants and find more money means that academics have less time for interesting research. All of this meant that I was unwilling to put myself through the pain of waiting for a permanent job, as described above.Now that I’ve been ‘out’ for a year, I’d find it very difficult to go back in. I very much miss much of academia - particularly being involved with the university and with teaching. However, my salary now is considerably more than I was earning as a postdoc, so I’d probably have to take quite a pay cut to go back to academic life.Thanks for the A2A.","5,705 followers",Wes Winn,553,3.2K,26.8M,2016,https://www.quora.com/Is-it-possible-to-get-into-software-developer-job-in-top-technological-companies-after-10-years-in-academia-as-lecturer-professor

I’m borrowing this line from aI would be somewhat anxious about recommending Mars to be developed with top technology. When we find ourselves in positions where we need the purest materials most painstakingly constructed into intricate precision to meet the newly formulated design concept of the tip-Living on Mars will primarily need to be in subterranean caverns or enclosed regions. With 3/8th gravity, making large enclosed spaces should be quite possible. An enclosure of multiple layers seems the most logical way to proceed:Several layers could be used by humans with various levels of environmental suits. Inventory and manufacturing could occur in those levels. A translucent dome seems possible with panels of s-shaped reflective tubes. Light would navigate through the tube but cosmic rays would collide with the ambient material such as concrete.The density of light tubes could be quite high allowing the inside to have a significant glow during the day.Building the Mars economic infrastructure as well does not fare well focusing on the supreme level of technology. 5nm integrated circuits are very technologically advanced, but the infrastructure to make 5nm is very involved. In the process of building out the Mars economy, we need to optimize the resource that is most important — the payloads required from Earth.In terms of engineering capability on Mars, we need to focus on the bulkiest items that are the least technologically sophisticated first — rocket fuel, water, etc, and work towards less bulky, more sophisticated items.Earth will be a good supply for CPUs and flat-panel displays for a long time, and we don’t need to build those on Mars until after we resolve products like wire, metal, glass, food, and fuel.Technologically sophisticated is a red herring. You want the easiest solutions on Mars produced with the least bulky supplies sent from Earth. Super-precise, high tech, overly engineered capabilities will eventually come to Mars, but it is not the primary consideration for success.",32 followers,Xavier Tsai,11K,281,3.3M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Is-it-possible-to-get-into-software-developer-job-in-top-technological-companies-after-10-years-in-academia-as-lecturer-professor

She wouldn’t be into me.”The following week, someone’s parents went out of town and there was a big party at their house.I was in a hallway on the second floor, and turned into a pool room to see if anyone was playing.I always felt slightly out of place at these big parties with people I barely knew. So playing these games helped alleviate my social anxiety.I walked into the room. The lights were on but nobody was in there.Then, I turned around and—boom—there she was.Rachel.I’ll never forget it. She was standing with her nose about two inches from mine. I could feel her breath on my neck. My heart started racing.She paused, smiled, and said, “So tell me, Sean—how cute is a button?”I felt this wave of adrenaline and praised the gods.There are few greater feelings in this world than finding out your crush, who you thought was out of your league, likes you back.I wish that moment upon each of you.","358,770 followers",Sean Kernan,2.8K,5.6K,726M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Is-it-possible-to-get-into-software-developer-job-in-top-technological-companies-after-10-years-in-academia-as-lecturer-professor

New York is a patchwork of old technologies such as loud metal-wheeled subways that are pathetic compared to far more modern systems in other cities such as Toronto, Montreal and Tokyo. Their drinking water system is unfiltered. Their waste systems rely on shipping millions of tons of garbage anywhere from Pennsylvania to China, after they were told to stop merely dumping it in the ocean as they had long been doing.A technically advanced city takes into account all human needs including transportation, communications, utilities, waste management and so forth and emphasizes energy efficiency and sustainability. To have an entire city meet these standards, the entire city would ideally be entirely new, and the West isn’t in the habit of creating whole new cities.The most advanced cities taking these needs into consideration are currently under construction in China as the antidote for old-world cities like Beijing that are drowning in their own waste and fast running out of drinking water. The US is way behind on this front and should start at least planning some new cities as they will surely be needed, since Miami, New Orleans and a number of other cities can be expected to be completely uninhabitable within the next few decades.Can hundreds of new ""ecocities"" solve China's environmental problems?New Orleans: Living under water isn’t a viable plan for the future",1 follower,Tushar Ahir,27.1K,105,5.9M,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-most-technological-thing-in-the-world

You close your tired eyes,That guy who scolded you on the road, that project you haven’t yet completed, that client who abused you, that girl whom you wanted to date but couldn’t because she’s engaged, that uncle who thinks you’re a rapist, that aunty who hates you for no real reason, that job which could’ve made you happy but you let go because of the low package, and that moment in life where you thought you could be awesome, but you’re still stuck in a mundane average life pondering over possibilities in future, all these, like venom slowly taking your life one bit at a time, starts to creep in.You close your eyes tightly hoping that you would eventually fall asleep, but nope.
