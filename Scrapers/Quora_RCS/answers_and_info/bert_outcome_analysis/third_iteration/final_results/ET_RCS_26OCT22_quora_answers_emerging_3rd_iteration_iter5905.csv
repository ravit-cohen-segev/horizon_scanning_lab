Germanys Stuka Dive Bombers were notorious for the terrifying shriek they made as they fell on their targets, the RAF's midnight carpet bombing of Axis cities caused untold civilian casualties, and it was the decimation of Hiroshima and Nagasaki by U.S. dropped nuclear bombs that helped to finally end the war.As with any new technology, people were eager to see what aerial bombing could do. One of those people was Barnes Wallis.Wallis was British, a very clever engineer, and a ruthless strategist. When he saw the potential aerial bombing could have on German infrastructure, he set his sights on a target lots of people thought of as invulnerable: dams.Not only did dams provide water and hydroelectric for thousands of Germans, if the British could take them out the resulting deluge would cause massive amounts of damage far exceeding that of any bombs at the time.There was one problem though. The Germans knew what a tantalizing target their dams made, and so reinforced all major dams with heavy stockades of anti-torpedo netting.Remember, this was still in the early stages of ariel bombing, guided missiles were a thing of the future, and the current tech was not near accurate enough to hit the side of a dam without using a torpedo dropped way out in front of it.But Wallis had a plan. If he couldn't send the bomb plunging downEverything needed to go perfectly for this thing to work, and so the British Government hired a Civil engineering firm to find out exactly how big a bomb has to be in order to take down a dam. Turns out that 2 tons of Compact RDX and TNT will do the job as long as it explodes right up against the dam.So how do you get something that big to skip? Wallis designed a cylindrical bomb that would get twisted into a backspin before being released low and fast. The bomb would use the Magnus effect, which is the lift created by rapidly spinning objects, to keep momentum even after the first skip. The backspin would also keep it stable enough to skip straight down the line and the velocity of spin and approach could be adjusted to an accurate range.Of course, precision was key if the bombing was going to be successful. And because you can’t really use the trial and error method during a raid, the pilots needed a way to tell exactly when and where to release the payload.The testing began over Chesil beach in England. With a constant speed of spin (500rpm) on the bomb, the problem of determining the altitude of release had to be worked out. This was solved, like so many problems are, using good old geometric triangles ∆ Two searchlights were mounted on the belly of the bomber at such angles that their beams converged on the water below only when at the right altitude of release. This was as simple as it was practical as the raid was planned to take place under the cover of darkness.(Anonymous art showing searchlight method)The second problem of determining the range of release used a similar concept. By this time the target dams had already been chosen. They were Möhne, Edersee, and Sorpe, three vitally important dams in the northern Rhineland of Germany that had been scouted and photographed by Allied reconnaissance aircraft. Using these images, Walis designed custom bombsights that, when at the correct range, would line up with unique features of each dam (likely the flak towers) and in doing so signal the time of release.Finally, after months of testing on reservoirs throughout England, and the training of an elite mission force, it was time to see if the thing actually worked.(Walis and others watch a testing run in Kent)On the night of May 16, 1943, 3 waves of 19 total Avro Lancaster heavy bombers, each fit with a Skipping Dambuster, took off from RAF Scampton in England.(Art by Pat Speirs)It was a long and treacherous flight, especially in the dark. The first casualties were taken down by flak over the Northern coast of the Netherlands, two more planes crashed into powerlines, and one plane had its bomb ripped off by a rogue swell while skimming over the north sea, with that, the entire first wave of bombers was destroyed.The second wave fared better, but, when the first bomb was sent spinning towards Möhne dam, it blew up prematurely and did little or no damage. The second bomb was either dropped to late or, too fast, and went skipping clear over the dam where it absolutely annihilated an unsuspecting powerhouse on the far side.Finally, after the third bomb was sent spinning hopelessly off course, the fourth one skipped, sunk, and blew up right against the dam. The hit weakened the dam and, invigorated by this success, the next bomber, piloted by David Maltby, dropped low, released his payload, and climbed as the bomb skipped, sunk, and blew apart Möhne dam.(Art by Robert Taylor)(Actual destruction of Möhne dam)The aircraft then continued to Edersee dam, which took three bombs before finally breaching.(Edersee Dam before)(Edersee Dam after)The remaining aircraft then took runs over Sorpe dam. But the approach turned out to be difficult and dangerous, and when the surviving bombers finally turned for home, Sorpe stood solid.When the raid was done, only 11 of the original 19 Lancasters made it back to base, and 56 men were lost.Nevertheless, the mission was seen as an undeniable success for the Allied powers. The resulting floods from the collapse of Möhne and Eder, damaged or destroyed literally dozens of German bridges, factories, and mines. Acres and acres of farmland along with an estimated 1500 people were drowned. Production and transportation for the war effort were crippled, and huge amounts of German workers and resources had to be diverted as the dams were frantically rebuilt over the next 5 months.This answer has definitely gone on long enough, but if you want to learn more go watch:Edit: Thanks to the commenters who added info or pointed out mistakes :)∆∆∆",134 followers,Evan Connolly,1.1K,454,1.2M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Which-technologies-emerged-from-World-War-II-Which-country-was-most-innovative

By the end of the war Canada would have the fourth largest airforce.In terms of armaments, several bombers and allied arms were produced in Canada, even the famous M1 Garand was designed by a Canadian. During the Manhattan Project and the development of the atomic bomb, the enriched uranium and plutonium that was vital to its completion was produced by Canada.Not bad for a country of only 11 million, yet on the world stage we’re hardly a footnote in terms of our contributions…perhaps because we don’t advertise it.

World War II, unlike the first world war, was a war of annihilation and clashing political ideologies, some genocidal, and not just on the Axis side. In Europe Hitler was fighting a both a race war and a rematch of the Great War pitting an authoritarian state against”the decadent democracies.” Though the Versailles Peace Treaty and the “Guild and Reparations” clause triggered the Second European War Hitler had much broader goals in mind than mere revenge. “Until the first war I was sentimental about losses in combat. Then, when I saw thousands of my comrades fall to the left and right of me I realized the individual is nothing and preservation of the species everything.” Hitler always held true to the belief that no sacrifice is too great in war if that war is fought for the sake of race. The millions who fell on the Eastern front died to save Europe, dominated by Germany, from “Bolshevism and the Jewish poison from which it springs.” Hitler truly believed history, and the German people, would not forgive him if he DID NOT send so many German soldiers to their graves in this “Crusade in the East.” After Stalingrad he took to the radio and spoke, “What is life? Life is the German people, not the individual soldier.” To this end Hitler mobilized a mass technology of death. “First the tank, then the airplane and finally the battleship.” Part of Hitler’s military genius his realization that whereas the nineteenth century had been dominated by naval power, and thus by Britain, the combination of the tank and airplane had made land warfare once again decisive, and now it was Germany’s turn to master the world. If he could muster enough tanks and planes to mount a giant land invasion of Russia, then Germany would conquer the “world heartland”; its hegemony unchallenged for a thousand years. Yet, this territorial conquest was but a prelude to the holocaust. Mass industrial technology at the service of genocidal ideology to redraw the racial map of Europe and put an end the Jews, Slavs and the Roma, among other “enemies of the Reich.”I do not believe the rape of Nanjing and other atrocities were equal to the holocaust, either morally or practically. Japan had different designs and goals for the war than Nazi Germany. Her actions in China and Korea proved imperial Japan could be just as brutal as the Nazis when it came to civilians. The big difference is that Japan did not aim for a war of annihilation of whole peoples, as Hitler did for the Jews and Roma, among others. Since Japan wanted to build a “Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere” (GEACS) she had to give some degree of autonomy to subject peoples. We know the Japanese had the capacity for biological warfare in China, yet it was not used to kill millions of Chinese. Why not? Japan envisioned China as a future junior partner in the GEACS, not a desolate wasteland as Hitler planned for the Soviet Union. Japan developed her own brand of racial superiority, “Occidentalism” as the scholar Ian Buruma calls it, before World War II, but this was totally different from the eradicationist anti-semitism that was already in vogue in Germany before Hitler took power.",UNKNOWN,Julio Cesar Pino,5K,1.1K,17.3M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Which-technologies-emerged-from-World-War-II-Which-country-was-most-innovative

Most battles lasted weeks or, occasionally, months - the Battle of the Atlantic lasted five years, from Britain's entry into the war in September 1939 until the German surrender in May 1945.The Battle of the Atlantic involved no ground forces. It was a battle of willpower, determination, technological advancement, code-breaking and strategy. It was not fought over hills or cities, but over a million square miles of stormy ocean. There were no pitched battles or squadron actions, but more than a thousand single-ship encounters and over 100 convoy battles that collectively decided the course of the war.Victory in the Battle of the Atlantic, or at least the avoidance of defeat, was a prerequisite for pushing back the Nazis in every theatre. The convoys that sailed from Canada and the USA went to supply food and resources to Britain, helping to keep it in the war. Ships carried material that was necessary for D-Day, equipment that was vital for the defence of Moscow, Stalingrad and Leningrad, and even Prime Ministers and Presidents.Although most of the action came at sea, most of the vital work was done in Britain, in places such as the Admiralty in London and in Bletchley Park. It was here that strategies were decided on, Ultra was developed and the Enigma code was cracked - it was here, in many ways, that the war was won.The Battle of the Atlantic was also one of the greatest displays of co-ordination between the air and naval forces in the war. The Swordfish and Sunderland aircraft with Coastal Command did a great deal to spare the Royal Navy the task of endless searches for submarines. The work of Coastal Command is often overlooked, as Fighter Command’s work in the Battle of Britain and Bomber Command’s work over ‘Fortress Europe’ are considered more vital, but in many ways Coastal Command was the most important of the three RAF branches.Similarly, World War Two is often considered a bad time in the history of the Royal Navy. There were no great clashes of battleships as in the First World War. The Royal Navy did not sweep all before them without losing a ship as in the Napoleonic Wars. There were no great battles to sing about such as the Saintes or Quiberon Bay.But that misses the successes of the Battle of the Atlantic. Every U-boat sunk, every convoy that reached Britain - these were all victories, and the Royal Navy had more of them in World War Two than at any other point in history. It was not battleships or aircraft carriers that won the Battle of the Atlantic - it was the destroyers, and their crews.The sacrifice of the sailors and airmen in the Battle of the Atlantic cannot be overstated. 72,200 sailors were killed on cold mornings and in stormy nights while sailing across the bleak ocean. Almost half of them were civilians. It is a stark reminder that war is not just fought by soldiers. War, particularly a war as total as that of the Second World War, is a terrible burden on civilians, and they would not be spared by their underwater enemies.In the air, some 721 aircraft were lost in anti-submarine sorties. Some were intercepted by enemy fighters. Some flew into storms and never flew out. Some got lost, and simply flew on and on over an endless ocean before running out of fuel and drowning in the sea.It’s a measure of how vital the battle was that, although Allied losses more than twice that of the Axis, there has never been any suggestion of an Axis victory. The continual victory in the Battle of the Atlantic allowed Britain to be supplied with food and fuel. It allowed fresh American forces to reinforce the tired British forces. The logistical and strategic powers that victory gave the Allies allowed them to land in Tripoli and mop up the North African theatre, before crossing the strait into Italy. It allowed the Soviets to survive when they were desperately fighting for their survival in front of Moscow, and it allowed the greatest naval operation in history to go ahead.Just as in World War One, victory in the Battle of the Atlantic was the only hope the Germans had for defeating Britain and winning their war.

He took us to war and my husband never came back. I was left a single mother. Then came Hitler and I believed him. He also took us to war and my son never came back. Then I was just an old mother without a child. The communists came and said that this time, everything would be better. I believed them. They took away the beautiful house my late husband built for me and gave it to someone else. So don’t be as stupid as I was, never trust any politician.”",UNKNOWN,John D'Isselt,515,189,298.4K,2017,https://www.quora.com/Which-technologies-emerged-from-World-War-II-Which-country-was-most-innovative
15,"I have a working proof of concept prototype of a Centrifugal propeller. A video of it is posted on YouTube. I am within a couple of weeks from having a practical purpose prototype that will actually lift into the air. The Centrifugal Propeller will replace all jet engines, rockets, and most air and marine propellers. It will also be used for lifting purposes both commercially and domestically. It has no speed limit in outer space because it will continually accelerate.",241 followers,Sonali Kerketta,22.4K,0,0,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-emerging-power-electronic-techniques-in-solar-energy-technology

If not then have a look at these pictures.If you are thinking that these images have been edited, then let me tell you one thing: that these are real.Crown shynessThe effect usually occurs between trees of the same species and sometimes between different species.One theory assumes a tree's leaves can feel when they are approaching another tree. Once they sense a nearing neighbor, the growing process halts, ensuring that light can penetrate the canopy and photosynthesis continue.Another possible explanation is that this is a defense mechanism against leaf-eating insects. The gaps mean bugs wouldn't be able to reach other trees, impeding their spread.The next time you're out walking through the forest, take a moment to look above you and you might be pleasantly surprised by what you find.Edit 1: Thanks Robert Taylor for the correction.Edit 2: Thank you all for your love, affection, and kind comments.",18 followers,Asim Qureshi,1K,996,156.1M,2017,https://www.quora.com/Which-technologies-emerged-from-World-War-II-Which-country-was-most-innovative
19,"Emerging technologies are found in a variety of ways. Sometimes they are developed in response to a specific need, while others result from serendipity or chance. New technologies are often discovered through research and development (R&D). Scientists and engineers spend years exploring different possibilities and testing different hypotheses in search of new and better ways to do things. Some technologies are also discovered through commercial applications.","87,312 followers",Shefali Naidu,9.4K,822,49.9M,2022,https://www.quora.com/Which-technologies-emerged-from-World-War-II-Which-country-was-most-innovative
