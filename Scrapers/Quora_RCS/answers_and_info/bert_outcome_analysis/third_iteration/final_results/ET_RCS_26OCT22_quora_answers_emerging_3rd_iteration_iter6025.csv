1,"It isn’t yet because it can’t do very much except do maths very, very quickly.Therein lies the problem. There’s a thing called the Rivest-Shamir-Adelman (or as it’s better known, RSA) Algorithm.Right. Here comes the really boring mathsy bit. Every number can be made of primes. Oh you don’t believe me, eh? Right. Twelve. 2 X 2 X 3. Fifty-six. 2 × 2 × 2 × 7. One hundred and fifteen. 5 × 23It’s quite easy to work out factors like that for little primes, but as the primes get bigger it gets much, much harder.Why does this matter? Because encryption. RSA works by using two very big prime numbers.It isn’t yet because it can’t do very much except do maths very, very quickly.Therein lies the problem.

RSA works by using two very big prime numbers. Call them x and y. Then they’re multiplied together to get the product n. Then you find the totient function (don’t even ask) which is t(n)=(x-1)(y-1).With it? Good. This is where I drop to sleep but the next thing you do is select an integer e that is co-prime to t(n) and 1<e<t(n). The pair n and e make up a public key.Then you find d. Look, I didn’t invent it, alright? The d is from ed=1 mod t(n).Sigh. The values of n and d make up the private key.You then let everybody know the public key but not the private. Encryption between Cyphertext and Plaintext is C=P^e mod n. Decryption is P=C^d mod n.Simples. Any road up, the practical upshot is that were you and your mates to try to factor it out with your pencils, WH Smith would be making gigantic profits on Staedtler HBs and A4 paper for the next five billion years and you still wouldn’t be anywhere near cracking it, and even the fastest box o’ transistors couldn’t crack it in reasonable time.The practical upshot is that when PVCQueen1980 and RandyRoger are messaging each other onAnd admit it, you clicked on that link just for a nosey, didn’t you? You bloody well did, don’t lie to me. Shame on you. It’d probably be shame on me too, but my sense of shame and I have not spoken since 1973 and so it isn’t, not at all.But back to the topic (as the actress said to the Bishop). The whole secret squirrel thing depends on boxes of transistors doing maths fast. If you’ve got a box of quantum doo-dads that can do maths zillions of times faster, you’ve got something that can break RSA in a reasonable time.So it’s just as well then that quantum computers are currently bloody useless for nearly everything. Because they need certain conditions, they look as though they’re going to stay nearly useless for nearly everything, but there’s always the remote possibility that some speccy twat in a university computer science lab will have a rush of blood to the head one day and say to somebody who knows how to make things “what if we could…….” and then shall come the end of days. This is why if you see a CS graduate in the wild, you should call the police who will humanely catch it and take it to the university where it will be properly looked after and fed a diet of Pringles, sugary doughnuts, and pop, whilst it harmlessly roams the tiled floors amongst its own kind.

So, quantum computers will be used mostly for research purposes. But, the few areas quantum computers will give us important advances such as simulating chemistry, strong cryptographic protocols and (maybe) machine learning/data processing will eventually spread their benefits across society. Imagine a world where we have better pharmaceuticals and structural materials from simulating chemistry on a quantum computer as well as perfectly private internet and unforgeable money from better cryptographic protocols. It’s hard to imagine how different it will be!Unfortunately, before that, there are some serious theoretical and engineering challenges to overcome. At the time of writing, companies are just starting to reach the 50 qubit threshhold, which may be enough to cross the first major hurdle: demonstrating a quantum device which can do something (anything!) better than our most powerful classical computers. Next, quantum computers need to be scaled way, way up. It has been proposed that quantum computers may require dozens or hundreds of fabricated qubits to equal a single, perfect qubit studied by computer scientists, so we have a long way to go! Once there are many high quality qubits, the error rate for all gate operations must go way down. Errors in quantum computers happen more easily, and classical systems of error correction will not work. This may be a more difficult hurdle than scaling up since a lot of environmental noise must be eliminated and every step of the computation has to be very precise. Finally, we have to figure out which programs work! There is no guarantee that after all of this work that QC’s will be better than normal computers at everything they are theoretically good at. Lots of testing and improvement must be done to find out which areas QC’s really excel at.",256 followers,Priyal Gupta,9.7K,0,0,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-top-5-emerging-technologies-in-2021-22-What-is-the-future-of-quantum-computing-and-what-are-its-applications

To buying and wearing condoms -to women taking birth control for medical reasons and for preventing pregnancy , getting tested for hiv, stds etcif we continue to listen and be a people pleasure then we are actually ripping ourselves into pieces keep others whole.

You have every right to use a gun, spray, knife, kick, punch, bite, using anything you see to fight off an attacker when your life is on the line.there nothing wrong with being stern, not nice when he or she is making you uncomfortable with inappropriate comments, touching etc etc.Society is so fake that the truth hurts people.Fuck society and be yourself. It doesn’t matter what gender, race, religion or sexuality you are. Just do you only for you. Life is too short. Find out what works for you. What you don’t like. Set boundaries. Take care of yourself mentally, emotionally and physically. That’s the most important. Because if you don’t your gonna drive you crazy. To the point your about to harm yourself or kill yourself. Just be you only for you. Pray if you have too. Because there will always be someone you know or don’t know who will put beauty standards, gender roles, tell you what you can or cannot do with your own body, who you love , tell you whatever hobbies you like or interested in trying, someone will always say something ignorant along the lines, that’s black people stuff , that’s white peoples stuff bullshit stereotypes.It’s society what’s wrong all along.
