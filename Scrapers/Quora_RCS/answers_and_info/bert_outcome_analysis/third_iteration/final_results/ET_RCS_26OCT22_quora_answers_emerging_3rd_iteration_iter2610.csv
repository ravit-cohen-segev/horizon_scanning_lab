His crime? He did not hit the day’s target of work set by the ‘civilized’ Europeans (Belgians) under the forced labor policy in Africa.Well, Africans achieved everything until Europeans arrived.Evicted them from their productive land and set famine and starvation rolling.Tampered with their peace and harmony, set communities against each other, to divide them, weaken them militarily as the only way to defeat them.Captured them and took them as slaves. Left only the infants and the aged. An entire productive generation was taken away.Robbed them of their identity; their language, their culture, their philosophy, all deemed evil. Replaced with theirs which they themselves hardly believed in.In the words of Chinua Achebe, the Europeans ‘put a knife on everything that held us together, and we fell apart’.Like the devil, the Europeans came to “steal, kill and destroy”. And they never disappointed. They carved a bloody path; their hands and coats are forever stained.So, yes. Africa was self-contained, self-reliant. Africa had achieved everything important that the west hasn't, and might never achieve. And the Europeans made sure that we lost that. They succeeded. They have tried so much to send guilty pounds to appease their conscience. But our lives and achievements were priceless. Their actions were / are unacceptable and unforgivable.

1,"I recommend reading, “Diamond discounts the theories which claim biological differences account for theI recommend reading, “Diamond discounts the theories which claim biological differences account for the differing patterns of development throughout the world. Instead, Diamond argues that environmental factors played a prominent role in determining why different regions of the world developed at different rates. Diamond explains why he feels this research is necessary by stating, “Until we have some convincing, detailed, agreed-upon explanation for the broad pattern of history, most people will continue to suspect that the racist biological explanation is correct after all. That seems to me the strongest argument for writing this book” (1999, p. 25).Food production is the major theme in Diamond’s book. According to Diamond, one of the most important factors leading to Eurasia’s supremacy was the development of food production. Before the development of food production, societies were primarily nomadic, with people moving frequently to hunt and gather food. Food production was essential in the development of guns, germs, and steel. Food production transformed the societies that acquired it. Food production led to effective societies by permitting people to specialize in things other than farming. Agricultural societies were more complex and were able to develop armies that could conquer less well-equipped hunting and gathering societies. Diamond believes that the Eurasian continent was more hospitable to the development of food production than other regions of the world. The majority of plants and animals suitable for domestication can be found on the Eurasian continent, specifically in the Fertile Crescent. Diamond suggests that the regions of the world that failed to develop food production did so because of environmental constraints, not due to a lack of knowledge.One example I found particularly convincing was Diamond’s analysis of the Maori and Moriori people of Polynesia. His study of these peoples gives insight into the dissimilar patterns of development worldwide. Although the Maori and Moriori were both descendants of the same people, their development took very different paths, due to the climate of the islands where both groups settled. The Maori settled in Northern New Zealand, the Moriori settled the Chatham Islands. The resources on these two islands were vastly different, and the Maori were able to take advantage of their environment to build a society that supported food production, armies, and craft specialists. The Moriori remained hunters and gatherers in an egalitarian society. Diamond demonstrates by this example that food production was critical in determining how each society developed. Also, because the Chatham Islands were isolated, the Moriori had very little contact with the outside world. In contrast, the Maori had contact with people from other regions, which enabled them to acquire technology and trade with outsiders. Diamond emphasizes throughout the book that the spread of knowledge and ideas was critical in the development of food production and other technologies throughout the world. Due to their isolation, the Moriori people were not able to learn from others. This illustration substantiates Diamond’s contention that environmental factors are the best explanation for the differences among human societies.In addition, Diamond claims that not only did Eurasia have an advantage in the development of food production; the continent also had a favorable position on the global axis. The major axis of Eurasia is East-West, while the major axis of the Americas and Africa is North-South. The climate across the East-West axis is similar, and the terrain is easy to traverse. This allowed domesticated crops from the Fertile Crescent to spread quickly across Eurasia and North Africa. These crops were successful due to similar climates and lengths of days. On the other hand, Africa and the Americas’ North-South axis and diverse landscapes prevented the spread of crops across long distances, which blocked the spread of food production. The East-West Axis also made the spread of technology across the Eurasian continent easier than in other parts of the world. Accordingly, Eurasia’s favorable environment allowed it to outpace other continents on the road to development.That’s my long but short synopsis of a wonderful and thoroughly researched book by Jared Diamond. If you want a slightly different take on the same subject, I’d also recommend, “",UNKNOWN,Ke'Aun,1K,1.1K,21.8M,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-advanced-technologies-have-African-scholars-achieved-with-efficiency

This dynamic was the norm until the industrialisation and is called Malthus' trap. So in a sense the question inverts the causality.Furthermore, being rich reduces the incentive to have kids by reducing reducing fear of old age poverty where you need your kids to take care of you. Also education, which has historically been a driver and driven by wealth, insentivises the educated to spend time on their interests, which may or may not be kids. On average, this means fewer kids. Finally, rich countries have access to birth control, and birth control make countries richer by allowing women to be more economically productive members of society.
