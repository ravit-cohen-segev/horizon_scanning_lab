Now understand that this list is purely subjective and is in no particular order. So, feel free to leave your suggestions in the comment bar below. So, without much late, let's get started.5G Technology.First up on our list we have 5G technology. Now, 5G is the next generation of Cellular Networks and Services. Currently the market is led by Switzerland and closely followed by South Korea and the US. Now, I understand this was on our list the previous year and a bigger rollout of this technology was expected this year. But that has been pushed to the next. Now, 5G is expected to give at least 20 GBPS downlink and 10 GBPS uplink, which makes it at least 40 times faster than our current 4G LTE. Now this opens up opportunities for telecom operators to give us new services, customer experience and network operations. Now, certain companies which are investing heavily in this technology for the testing and development of equipment are Samsung, Intel, Huawei, Deloitte, Nokia, Ericsson and Qualcomm.Internet of Behaviours.Next on our list, we have Internet of Behaviours. Now, a lot of industrial sites are employing computer vision to determine whether their employees have been complying with the protocol. Not just that, this data is then collected and processed by various organizations, trying to influence their employee behaviour using this data. Now this collection of data and processing to drive human behaviour is known as the Internet of Behaviours. This data could be collected from anywhere. It may be commercial, consumer databases, government agencies, public domains, social media, GPS locations. As the sophistication of this technology grows so will the adoption of this trend. Major players of the market such as AWS, Microsoft, SAP, Dell, Cisco and Cloudera are all the front runners of this market but other companies are not too far behind.DevOps.Next on our list, we have DevOps. As most of you might have guessed, it is short for Development, Security and Operations. The main objective here is to implement Security on the same scale and speed as Development and Operations. With the wider adoption of microservices Develops has successfully navigated its way into our big players such as NASA, Amazon, Dell and IBM who were already big players in the DevOps market. But not just that, an anywhere operations model is vital for businesses to emerge successfully from the current economy. The whole idea here is to access, deliver and enable all sorts of platforms and applications and operations from anywhere that you are.

By the time you invent lathes, milling machines, planers, open hearth furnaces, rolling mills and so on, your resources are capable of creating vastly more new items.Advance that basic mechanical engineEverything else being equal, technological change will accelerate. By ""everything being equal"", I mean that a serious economic dislocation, such as a Great Depression, can obviously affect how business and governments spend money.The rationale for my position is simple. When your only technology is a stone axe, you have few resources to create new technology and change occurs at a glacial pace. By the time you invent lathes, milling machines, planers, open hearth furnaces, rolling mills and so on, your resources are capable of creating vastly more new items.Advance that basic mechanical engineering background to 3D printers and advancement goes up. Throw in computers capable of analyzing problems and providing rational solutions (rather than using trial and error) and you are capable of doing things that were previously impossible or, if nothing else, prohibitively difficult.Beyond all of the above we're looking at revolutions in materials technology (which let us make old things better and new things that were previously impossible). Biotechnology opens the doors to new foods, medical treatments, materials, industrial processes. Further study into physics, even without major conceptual breakthroughs, points to principles that can enable entirely new fields of technology.I could go on, but that would be simply redundant. Whenever you have any process that builds upon its past achievements, you have the potential for explosive growth. Technology fits that description better than anything else I can think of.(PS...not all advancement will be adopted. My dad was born in 1930 and his breakfasts included Kellogg's Corn Flakes and pancakes with Log Cabin Maple syrup.
