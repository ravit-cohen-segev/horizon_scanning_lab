Because of this technology, you can trade with anyone around the globe, without knowing about him personally and without any intermediate party (like banks or other companies).For egLets level up a bit. Blockchain is basically a network of computers calledSo instead of one company or a database which holds all the information, now the information is spread across whole of the network. Whenever a transaction occurs, that is validated by everyone and is put ahead in that history of transactions in that network. All the transactions are encoded using a technique called cryptography.Please note that blockchain is not only aboutWell this was a very basic surface level, small drop idea from a vast ocean of depth of technicalities in blockchain. But I hope you got to know very basic idea about this revolutionising concept which is surely gonna shape our world in coming 5–10 years.Content reference: Article by","31,158 followers",Phillip Remaker,1.7K,11K,78.8M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Can-you-explain-the-new-upcoming-IT-technology-blockchain

That’s simply not true. We can’t prove a lot, that’s true, but research and experience has shown that we can help the people who show up in our offices.I have been treating patients in my practice here in Texas since 1985. Since that time, I have had the privilege of treating patients in multiple generations of the same family, as my patients get better, stay better, and refer their family and friends to me.I receive no money from anyone except my patients. For about three years, several years ago, a few pharmaceutical companies paid me to talk to other physicians about their medications. They all chose to stop having me speak for them, as I was open and honest about the pros and cons of their meds, as well as the advantages of other medications. I had been in practice for about twenty five years before any of them every asked me to speak, and haven’t done so for several years now.I am a volunteer professor at my local university, and have been active in my local and state psychiatric organizations. I know first hand how many of my colleagues are honest, compassionate people, and volunteer large amounts of time with these organizations to further promote access for the underprivileged, homeless, and low income population. They do this with no personal or professional gain.The majority of my colleagues are decent, honest, upstanding people.The last item is that the brain ...","24,006 followers",Shanks Wang,5.9K,183,13.3M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Can-you-explain-the-new-upcoming-IT-technology-blockchain

3,"As of yesterday it’s no longer “next”.First pig heart being transplanted into a humanYesterday, January 10th, 2022, marks the first time an organ from a genetically modified animal, a pig, was transplanted into a human. We don’t know what will happen, but the pig was genetically modified in a way that makes it unlikely the organ will be rejected by the recepient and pig organs in general are quite similar to our own.I hope the recipient lives a rich full life with his new heart of a pig. Even if not, this is still a major step forward towards generating organs to order, without fear of rejectiAs of yesterday it’s no longer “next”.First pig heart being transplanted into a humanYesterday, January 10th, 2022, marks the first time an organ from a genetically modified animal, a pig, was transplanted into a human.

Even if not, this is still a major step forward towards generating organs to order, without fear of rejection. Even if the heart is rejected and the donor dies, what we learn from the process will enable us to succeed the next time. I reckon this will become the mainstream way we get spare parts by the end of the decade in an optimistic scenario, by the end of the next decade in the pessimistic one.Either way, the moment is as groundbreaking as December 3rd, 1967, when the first human heart ever was transplanted, ushering the era of organ transplants of today. That patient died after 18 days, I hope this guy does better.",0 followers,Lucas Martin,6.4K,65,4.2M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Psychiatrists-what-upcoming-psychiatric-technology-are-you-most-excited-about
