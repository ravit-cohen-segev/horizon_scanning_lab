Since all nuclear bombs function through critical mass (the most of a substance that can exist in a single lump without explosively decaying), there simply isn't enough of the nuclear substance left to achieve it, and thus explode. I imagine this takes much longer than the previous though, since those half-lives are generally quite long.","3,969 followers",Rafael Cavacchini,9.5K,427,8.3M,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-happens-to-a-nuclear-weapon-as-it-ages

Billions of dollars of funding have been made available over the decades since the mid-1950s for a variety of Magnetic Confinement Fusion experiments (tokamaks, stellarators, mirror machines, etc.). Sadly, there has been frustratingly little payoff for all this MCF pure fusion effort as never once in over six decades of effort has any MCF fusion experiment produced any net energy from fusion (even for micro-seconds).MCF fusion researchers and advocates promise (but do not actually deliver) smooth controlled release of MCF fusion power. ICF fusion worked and produced net energy from fusion from the very first experimental ICF fusion test (Ivy-Mike 1952).Practical Inertial Confinement Fusion produces power in a regular series of short controlled fusion bursts. This “pulse mode” of practical ICF power generation, and the military origins of the underlying technology, tends to scare the public and the public’s elected representatives in government who do not vote equivalent funding for practical ICF fusion, even though practical ICF fusion is the only form of fusion that has generated any net energy from fusion in over 60 long years of fusion experimentation.Inertial confinement fusion is the only form of fusion that has to date been proven to work in actual field experiments (not just in computer simulations). Halite-Centurion series underground test shots were fusion related add on shots piggy-backed onto DOE-DOD shots already on the underground test schedule. These shots were designed to utilize a small portion of the X-rays produced from the primary of an experimental device through a line of sight to ignite a remote fusion experiment housed remotely some distance away in the underground experimental test canister.Once classified Halite-Centurion test shots experimentally proved that small DT filled spheres could be ignited and brought to full fusion ignition using an intense beam of X-rays.ICF fusion has beenIf the public was comfortable in producing fusion energy in a succession of short fusion “bursts” instead of in a smooth continuous fusion burn; providing funding and committing National Lab design resources in a way comparable to MCF research, we could have with very low technical risk reliable ICF fusion power plants in a time frame that matters (proof of principal within 5 years - commercial ICF power plants in 10 years).",0 followers,John Holmes,826,1.2K,784K,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-happens-to-a-nuclear-weapon-as-it-ages

Well, we don’t know how, without first heating a furnace up to about 100,000,000°C.

Modern large-yield nuclear weapons in the megaton range, are actually fusion bombs (as opposed to the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima & Nagasaki in WW2, which were fission reaction bombs). Fusion bombs actually have fission “atomic bombs” wrapped around them, and use that nuclear explosion to create the 100 million degree heat required to get the fusion bomb ignited.There are a lot of ongoing experiments, in a lot of different countries, to attempt to make a working fusion reactor which would not require insane amounts of energy to heat up enough to start the fusion reaction, or to develop a process of “cold fusion”, but as of the current day, we do not know of a way to make such a device.",UNKNOWN,Viktor T.

These generate about 82 trillion joules per kilogram.Here’s what Wikipedia says about abundance of Uranium and Thorium.Naturally occurring uranium is composed of three major isotopes, uranium-238 (99.2739–99.2752% natural abundance), uranium-235 (0.7198–0.7202%), and uranium-234 (0.0050–0.0059%).Thorium [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorium ] is found in small amounts in most rocks and soils [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil ]. Soil commonly contains an average of around 6 parts per million (ppm) of thorium. Thorium occurs in several minerals [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineral ] including thorite [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorite ] (ThSiO4), thorianite [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorianite ] (ThO2 + UO2) and monazite [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monazite ]. Thorianite is a rare mineral and may contain up to about 12% thorium oxide. Monazite [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monazite ] contains 2.5% thorium, allanite [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allanite ] has 0.1 to 2% thorium and zircon [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zircon ] can have up to 0.4% thorium. Thorium-containing minerals occur on all continents. Thorium is several times more abundant in Earth's crust than all isotopes of uranium [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotopes_of_uranium ] combined and thorium-232 is several hundred times more abundant than uranium-235.Thorium concentrations near the surface of the earth can be mapped using gamma spectroscopy [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_spectroscopy ]. The same technique has been used to detect concentrations on the surface of the Moon; the near side [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near_side_of_the_Moon ] has high abundances of relatively thorium-rich KREEP [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KREEP ], while the Compton–Belkovich Thorium Anomaly [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compton%E2%80%93Belkovich_Thorium_Anomaly ] was detected on the far side [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_side_of_the_Moon ]. Martian [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars ] thorium has also been mapped by 2001 Mars Odyssey [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001_Mars_Odyssey ].Th232 decays very slowly (its half-life [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life ] is comparable to the age of the universe) but other thorium isotopes [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotope ] occur in the thorium and uranium decay chains.

Now IF we were able to extract most of that energy AND channel all of it into propulsive energy to accelerate the ship, AND if we stored a huge amount of both D and T in propellant tanks, it still would not get us anywhere close to relativistic speeds. This also presumes that a way will be found to extract the neutron’s energy, which is 80% of the total —- being neutral, it can’t be focused like the He can, thus channeling the neutron’s 14.1 MeV will be a difficult technical challenge. So let’s say your objective is to get to 10% of c (speed of light), meaning a 100 light-year journey to a distant star would take “only” one thousand years, then you’d have to convert mass equal to 0.5% of the ship’s total mass (including fuel) to propulsive energy. If HALF of that mass was D-T fuel, and your energy conversion-propulsion systems were 100% efficient, you’d only be converting 0.5*17.6/4693 = 0.19% of your mass to energy, far short of 0.5%. 0.19% would get the ship to 6.2% of c, a respectable speed BUT that assumes perfect efficiency. Dropping to an overall systems-wide realistic efficiency of 50%, the terminal velocity drops to 4.4% of c (but that’s 8200 miles/second!). However, there would probably be additional propulsive methods employed, such as using giant space-based lasers or solar mirrors to focus onto an ablative rear member that would literally push the ship forward with radiation pressure until it’s out of range, and solar sails that accomplish the same thing, but at a much lower level for a longer period of time.

How slowly? It produces less than 300 watts of heat per cubic meter. That’s comparable to… a well-maintained compost pile. Its less than the power density of our human metabolism.That’s all. That’s what you get when you lump enough mass to make more than 300,000 Earths.We obviously do not have 300,000 spare Earths to play with, and it would not be very practical either. So we cannot use gravitational confinement. We are trying to use other means to confine the fusion fuel for sustained fusion.And we aren’t simply trying to mimic the Sun. We want to do better. After all, for a practical fusion power generating station, we want to be able to produce a lot more power, perhaps up to a few hundred megawatts of raw thermal power per cubic meter inside the reactor. So we are trying to best the Sun by a factor of a million, give or take.That is hard. That is, if I may use somewhat unprofessional language, damn hard.

The fusion core emits a large number of fast neutrons, and these neutrons are capable of causing fission in ordinary U-238. So the fusion core in such a bomb is surrounded by U-238, and the induced fission gives about half of the energy. It also gives almost all of the fallout. So in the neutron bomb, this layer is omitted, resulting in much less fallout. The emitted neutrons, which can kill anyone nearby, give the neutron bomb its name.If you are still concerned about what MeV means, it is a unit of energy that is very useful for nuclear reactions.
