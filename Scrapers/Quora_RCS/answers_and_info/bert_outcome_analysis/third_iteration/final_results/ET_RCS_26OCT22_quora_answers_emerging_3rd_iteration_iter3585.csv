One of them is beasts of burden. In the Old World, there were oxen and horses to pull carts, greatly magnifying the already significant loads they could carry. Outside of the Andes and their domesticated camelids, though, the New World lacked good animal traction which makes for the best use of wheeled vehicles, and Peru‚Äôs mountainous terrain was terrible for carts which do best on level surfaces.Still, environmental issues aside, wheels probably wouldn‚Äôt have been that useful for them, any more than they would be for the people of Africa, East Asia, Australia, and others who didn‚Äôt get around to inventing them. A functional wheeled vehicle is a complex and relatively capital-intensive thing, involving the wheels proper, axles, and bearings, and it requires either roads or naturally hard, level ground, typically widely available only on the Great Plains. But in that terrain, boats would be more than competitive transportation near any kind of water (water transport remains vastly more efficient than wheeled vehicles to this day; the price has just dropped enormously in absolute terms), which people prefer to stay close to in any event, and feet and the occasional dog-pulled sled suffice when one must travel overland.TL;DR: There are environmental factors, but wheels aren‚Äôt as useful or important as one might expect.",269 followers,Karthik Reddy L,16K,0,0,2019,https://www.quora.com/Traditional-techniques-are-modified-to-obtain-advanced-technology-Do-you-agree-or-not

The Maya collapsed, and no one knew why. It was likely over-farming plus climate change 800 years ago. They apparently had a few sites with what we‚Äôd consider advanced plumbing, narrowing water pipes/channels to increase water pressure. A king even set up a tub that overlooked his kingdom that could be filled on command. These people lived for centuries before the Spanish surrounded by a world being taken over by the rainforest.We‚Äôre only starting to appreciate that the Amazon basin was home to a similar culture that collapsed, and barring a few mentions in the historical record, we know almost nothing except for the earthworks that dot it and the terra pretta they produced to make the soil much more fertile. And that soil remains fertile, while their descendants tend to rely on slash and burn agriculture.In short, fallen/lost civilizations are a real worldwide phenomena. They tap into a variety of emotions. And they create a great way for writers to reasonably come up with magic artifacts, hidden wonders and secret knowledge.

14,"With some worlds it makes perfect sense why things progress slowly, such as Middle Earth. Tolkien did that on purpose.But most of the time, I think it‚Äôs a flaw, and that‚Äôs what I‚Äôll address.First, I think a lot of it actually has to do with Tolkien. Lord of the Rings kinda set the mold for how a lot of people think of fantasy, but often they don‚Äôt understand why Tolkien made the choices he did. So they ape his work without laying the same foundation. Middle Earth was essentially supposed to be in decline, and if you really get into the weeds with his works you see this underlying framework.ButWith some worlds it makes perfect sense why things progress slowly, such as Middle Earth.

So they ape his work without laying the same foundation. Middle Earth was essentially supposed to be in decline, and if you really get into the weeds with his works you see this underlying framework.But if you don‚Äôt understand why Middle Earth was in decline, you may simply create a world that is essentially static because you‚Äôre following a familiar pattern. Then, decades later, some new author comes along, and since everyone before him wrote stories were borders didn‚Äôt change by even a mile, nor metallurgy improve, in a thousand years, he does the same thing because he just thinks that‚Äôs how it works. It becomes a trope.Another major factor I think is that many fantasy writers aren‚Äôt historians, they‚Äôre only history fans. While I am not a professional historian myself, I have actively studied history a great deal, both for writing inspiration and simply because I find history interesting on its own merits. To me, 100 years feels like along time. Our country is only 240 years old, and things changed radically in that time. I know how fast, and how slowly, technology can change in a century. It took centuries to go from bronze to iron swords, but in the span of a few hundred years we went from primarily mail armor to plate.If you‚Äôre a historian, even an amateur one, these armors all look quite different to you. If your a history fan, all but the last likely just read as ‚Äúmedieval‚Äù. My mother can figure out when a period piece takes place to theSo when people have things like unchanging countries that last millennia, I have to roll my eyes a little. This is what about 1000 years more likely looks like.Now granted, the Holy Roman Empire was a bit unusually dynamic. But I believe my point is made.I think for many people ‚Äúhistory‚Äù exists as this semi-nebulous idea of ‚Äúold stuff‚Äù, without necessarily a solid sense of the actual flow of events. Which isn‚Äôt the worst thing in the world, but it can lead to poor worldbuilding, where a sword a thousand years old is not even stylistically different from one today. In contrast, in the RPG I‚Äôm running my players are going to find an ancient, legendary sword‚Ä¶which will beThen there‚Äôs also the fact that many fantasy stories don‚Äôt really hinge around technological revolution the way science fiction does. Scifi can give you a whole story that revolves around how a piece of kit works and how that changes society. Fantasy often tells different sorts of stories, the primordial battle between good and evil, valiant knights against dastardly dragons, and suchlike.Now those are all Doylist answers. Lets delve into some Watsonian possibilities.The first and easiest is that‚Äôs just how the gods made the world.But that‚Äôs a bit lazy. Think of how technology actually progresses. Quite often, necessity really is the mother of invention. Someone has a problem, and it‚Äôs a big enough problem that he invents something to deal with it. Bronze was fine for making swords for centuries until around 1200BC during the Bronze Age Collapse supply chains were disrupted. Bronze, you see, is an alloy of copper and tin. But copper and tin aren‚Äôt found together, so it took rather large trade networks to bring them together to be smelted into bronze. When that trade network collapsed, something else was needed, and people turned to iron, which was a single-source supply and thus such vast trade networks weren‚Äôt necessary so long as a mine was nearby.However, if magic is availible, depending on just what magic in this world can do and how it works, the easiest answer might be to get a wizard to do it. Population on the rise? Can‚Äôt get enough yield out of the fields? Today we use fertilizers to improve the soil quality, tractors to cultivate vastly more grain than a man alone can manage, and similar solutions.But in a world of magic it might be easier to just ply a goddess with delicous apples to ensure a bountiful wheat harvest.Rather than inventing a crucible to make better steel, a smith might bribe a salamander to take up residence in his forge.And so on, and so forth. Conditions might be such that it is easier, faster, and cheaper to progress magic than what we think of as technology. Though of course you might instead see a fusion of magic and technology, with shoulder-fired wands and golem carriages.It could also be that things just progress slowly because every century or so, everything gets blasted to ash by a bloody dragon.Hard to invent computers when you‚Äôre dodging monsters ever other week.Though unchanging borders for millennia would still be weird without some sort of explanation.So I think most of the time, technology, society, etc, remain largely static due to a mix of cultural inertia and ignorance. Unless you know better, it feels right, because that‚Äôs what everyone else is doing. But you can still write your story that way, if you think aboutFor example, let us suppose that a rise in magic has caused technology to largely stagnate at a level comparable to Europe around 1200, and has done so for a thousand years. Our hero then finds a legendary sword 500 years old. It‚Äôs still made in fundamentally the same way as ‚Äútoday‚Äù, but it will be 500 years out of style. Our hero may think it looks ridiculous, gauche even, and may be loathe to wear it even if it is magic because it clashes with the style of his armor and other weapons.‚ÄúWhat?
