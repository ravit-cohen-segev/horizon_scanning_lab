I know how to do it. I have done similar things personally.Unfortunately I also do not find it implausible that there are people feeding their egos or wallets by spreading ignorance and distrust in science, including the science that led to one of the most monumental accomplishments of our shared humanity, the Apollo landings on the Moon.",UNKNOWN,Viktor T.

Remember, the signals were in plain, no code, no digital anything, it was TV signals and sound radio signals, enthusiasts and radio hams all around the world were listening, because they COULD. You can’t send signals from the Moon to one receiver on the Earth, it comes to all, like FM radio, so if there were no signals, somebody would have mentioned it at the time.I note that you only refer to Apollo 11, presumably the other 5 Apollo voyages are not contentious to you.",17 followers,Alan Higgins,3.9K,6.3K,7.6M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Do-you-find-it-implausible-that-Apollo-11-traveled-over-250-000-miles-through-space-and-landed-precisely-in-the-right-part-of-the-moons-gravity-well-to-achieve-a-stable-orbit

Cults strive to isolate members from all outside influences—-even family members. Those influences include facts. Cults inculcate disbelief in mainstream news publications, in subject matter experts, in science and scientists, even in the idea that there’s such a thing as truth. What cults want is devotion to the cult leader…period.The Soviets did this by putting out myriad alternate explanations and conspiracy theories about newsworthy events—especially ones adverse to Soviet interests. Putin espouses a different ideology but uses the same tactics. Thus when he was responsible for shooting down a Malaysian airliner full of Dutch tourists over Ukraine, the propaganda operations of the Russian military cranked out a blizzard of accusations and conspiracy theories—the equivalent if an airplane being chased by a missile spewing out bucketloads of metallic chaff to confuse the missile’s guidance mechanism.The Republican Party has adopted Soviet/Putin propaganda techniques in support of Trump’s cult of personality. Many people are naturally inclined to trust their leaders, dating back to primitive times when the leaders’ fortunes were coupled to those of their followers. And most people are genetically predisposed to trust their own senses over scientific claims that are counterintuitive. This is especially true for stupid people—those who would have done fine 100,000 years ago but who are overwhelmed by the complexities of modern life.Questions like this also demonstrate the Dunning-Kruger Effect, in which mentally limited people are not aware of their own limitations and have a very high self-image in defiance of reality.Thus some guy with a two-digit IQ can’t believe we could navigate a spaceship to the Moon because he couldn’t. Smart people have great difficulty imagining how people could be like this, because the most intelligent and knowledgeable people are usually acutely aware of how much they don’t know.This is why I coined the aphorism “It’s irrational to treat people as if they’re rational.”To understand the mind of anyone who would post a question like this is a challenge for the average Democrat. There’s such a huge gulf between those who dwell in the modern real world and those who live in a right wing cartoon that denies truth, experts, expertise, and liberalism.We are brought to this point by “freedom of speech” being conflated with “freedom to spread dangerous lies” by right wingers. People who like right wing media get a uniform, internally consistent world-view from Fox, Sinclair, hate radio, Newsmax etc.These media pander to people who’d ask questions like this and reinforce their false sense of self-worth.Yet what do we do about industrial-scale lying? Autocratic countries always have laws criminalizing “lying” which they interpret as meaning criticizing the autocrat and his kleptocratic operation.And of course questioning our space program enables antigovernment types who still haven’t forgiven the federal government for stealing their ancestors’ “property” in the “War of Northern Aggression” to express that racist hatred by denying the government’s greatest achievements.So while nothing appears racist in denying the success of our space program, in the tangled thicket that passes for right wing mentalities…it is.","220,646 followers",Franklin Veaux,4.4K,47.3K,783.2M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Do-you-find-it-implausible-that-Apollo-11-traveled-over-250-000-miles-through-space-and-landed-precisely-in-the-right-part-of-the-moons-gravity-well-to-achieve-a-stable-orbit

In fact, the basic orbit that the Apollo missions flew to the Moon had been worked out by Walter Hohmann in 1925 and it’s easy to explain to someone who’s taken a few weeks of freshman physics. Now, the details are critical, and that takes a lot of sophisticated calculation — which is whyBoth Ms. Johnson and Ms. Hamilton were awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom for their work.If you want to try this yourself, BTW, I recommend Kerbal Space Program. You’ll be able to fly the Apollo missions yourself — and you’ll have better hardware available to you than the Apollo astronauts did. However, the basic calculations are the same as those Ms. Johnson did.Getting to the Moon with sixties technology (particularly, sixties computing technology) was a stunning achievement.

18,"BMWs are very reliable, but as a high performance vehicle, requireIf you are going to buy a 4–5 year old BMW, the first thing I’d ask is if the cooling system has been overhauled. Cooling systems just wear out around the five year mark and typically require replacement of all the hoses, the radiator, the coolant pump and thermostat. For a 3 series, this will cost you around $1,200.00 in parts. If you aren’t doing it yourself, then get a quote from the stealer, er-r-r-r I mean dealer. It’s a tough job on a 3 series. Easier on a 5 series.You will alsBMWs are very reliable, but as a high performance vehicle, requireIf you are going to buy a 4–5 year old BMW, the first thing I’d ask is if the cooling system has been overhauled.

Easier on a 5 series.You will also need a new battery, but be aware; more recent models require a software recalibration of the voltage levels, which requires an expensive scanner. You can get the dealer to do this, but not for free.The next things to go will be the coil packs (expensive, but easily replaced by owner) and spark plugs (cheap). You’ll be amazed how how good the engine sounds and runs.Then you’ll need to replace the various engine sensors. These generally average about 100 dollar each, some less, some more. There aren’t very many, and they are installed very easily. What isn’t easy (specifically for the 3-series) is getting at them. For example, the crank sensor on an e90 is under the starter, which is under the intake assembly. You will need to remove the entire intake assembly to get to the starter, which you must also remove to get to a sensor that is held in with one bolt. When and if you replace the starter (yeah, that happened, but usually when the car gets to the decade mark…), replace the sensor. You don’t want to have to do this procedure twice.Then there are shocks and wheel bearings, depending on how hard the car has been driven. Another grand for the whole car.Finally, and perhaps most importantly, flushing the transmission should be done immediately! Bimmers have complex transmissions and while BMW refers to the transmission fluid as ‘life-time’, it’s bull (that goes for all makes). If you want to drive your bimmer for more than 150,000 miles, change out the fluid and filter every 40K. If you buy a used one and this hasn’t been done, do it right away. It’s relatively cheap.Do all this, and the car will drive like new for another five years, after which you can decide to repeat the process or just move on…In my opinion, used BMWs are a bad investment if you are just looking for a daily driver. You may look cool, but you will pay exorbitantly for the privilege.On the other hand, if you have the skills and can get one for say, 8–12K, another 3K in parts with some sweat equity, and you’ll have a nice hobby car.I still have my 2002 530i (purchased new…), whose transmission I’m currently rebuilding. It will never be a daily driver again, but I’m emotionally attached to it and when it hits its second decade, it will officially be a classic ;-)My wife’s 3-series is slated to be sold (update—is sold). I’ve done much of the work I’ve described above on this vehicle. Fun car to drive, but I’d never buy another one. She now drives a late model Honda and I’ve moved onto a Ford F150.Quite honestly, the only people who should buy a BMW are those folks for which a 100K is lunch money. For people who actually have to manage their financial life, it’s not a wise purchase.ADDENDUM: The issue of reliability has come up a few times with respect to this answer.

People go to a used car seller and get suckered in by that shiny BMW or Mercedes they could never afford when it was new, but miraculously it’s now within their price range! Most of them are first time European car owners and don’t realize they can’t treat them the same way as a Honda, Toyota, Chevy etc..they might have owned in the past. Also many don't realize that even the most basic maintenance will be much more expensive, but can't be skipped. The “$19.99 oil change special” absolutely doesn't apply to their cars, and they'll be lucky to get an oil change with good quality oil and filter for under $80, but for some European cars, the cost will be much higher. Parts for repairs and labor costs will also be higher, in some cases a heart attack inducing difference in price depending on specific make/model/trim level.Having said that, I became a first time VW owner recently (2015 Golf GTI) and haven’t had any serious issues, but I do have second hand evidence from friends and family that BMW and Mercedes should probably not be owned without some type of warranty, and that could also apply to higher end VW models, and that Includes Audi which these days is to VW what Acura, Lexus, Infinity are to their more pedestrian Japanese counterparts.

Screw that the customer says and drives home. The car still runs and looks good so they just accept it since they can’t afford the repair. A few months later, something else more serious happens. They take it back to the shop and find the ball joints are shot in the front lower control arms. It also wore out the tires because it affected the alignment. There’s no way out of this, so they pull the credit car and pay for new ball joints, 4 new tires and an alignment. $1400 later they’re back on the road. Things like this continue to happen and more things don’t get repaired. Eventually they say screw this and sell the car.

That meant that once the Apollo spacecraft did its big fuel expending burn to leave its Earth parking orbit and start arcing outwards towards the Moon it would be continually slowing down as Earth tried to pull it back, until it reached the point that the Moon had greater gravitational influence and it would start accelerating as it fell towards the Moon.","2,115 followers",Pavithran Subbiah,698,110,3.6M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Do-you-find-it-implausible-that-Apollo-11-traveled-over-250-000-miles-through-space-and-landed-precisely-in-the-right-part-of-the-moons-gravity-well-to-achieve-a-stable-orbit
