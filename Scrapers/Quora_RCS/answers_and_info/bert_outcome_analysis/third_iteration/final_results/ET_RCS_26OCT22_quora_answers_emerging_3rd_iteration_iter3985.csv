0,"The ancient age was full of superstition. The ""miracle and sorcery"" were illusions. The technology age is hardly emotionless. Much of what is developed and marketed most successfully is amied exactly at our emotions. for example the high penetration of cell phones and social networks is largely driven by peoples intense desire to be in touch with friends all day long. Humans have and will continue to be the emotional beings they have always been. Association of tech with emotionless is a myth that requires eyes shut to what is all around us everyday.",152 followers,Alex Mann,6K,2K,102.8M,2015,https://www.quora.com/If-you-were-to-choose-between-ancient-primitive-age-full-of-miracle-sorcery-and-distant-future-or-peak-of-technology-and-emotionless-period-where-would-you-rather-live-And-Why

2,"Medical science is currently in its infancy. Proof is trivial.Cure. Cure is not defined medically for ANY non-infectious disease.

Depression, bipolar, schizophrenia, and more cannot be cured, because cured is not defined. If, or when they are cured, the cure cannot be documented medically nor scientifically.Cured is not defined for any chronic disease. When any chronic disease is cured, the cure cannot be tested - there is no medical or scientific test - and the cure cannot be proven nor can it be disproven.There are no medical statistics of cured for any disease. Statistics about cured, for a few infectious diseases where cured is defined, are measured by treatment, not by disease.Medical science is eager to dismiss cure claims as bogus, fake, so-called “miracle cures”, but cannot define or detect a real cure for most diseases.It's not difficult to define cured scientifically.

5,"I think we should try your experiment! Lets stay civilized for a few billion years.Well, let’s start by getting civilized, at least. Oh, and we have to survive all the stuff that has us so worried in just the next hundred years…If we have descendants of our human culture around in a mere five billion years, the Sun will threaten to turn into a red giant, and the Andromeda galaxy will be passing through ours at about the same time.

Or maybe we’ll filter all the heavy elements out and rebuilt the original Sun for a museum exhibit.We’ve got people who believe in a technological singularity happening with a few dozen years. Plenty of us think that’s overoptimistic, but just how pessimistic does a person have to be to think most of those goals the Singularitarians dream of are going to take more than a few million years to achieve if they can be done at all? I can’t name a single goal than is likely to need a single billion years to achieve. Colonize the galaxy? If we can do it at all, it shouldn’t take more than a million years. Our imagination lets us picture the goals of the first 0.001% of your hundred billion years, then the other 99.999% of the list is totally empty.So there’s your answer. Nobody knows how to predict a trend line only 7,000 years or so long for a hundred billion years more.

Ten years before that, the internet was invented, and it too just completely changed our lives. Fifteen years before that, computers were affordable for the ordinary person, and it too just completely changed our lives.One thing to note here is that none of these were concrete technology inventions – computers had been around since the 1940s, computer communicating with one another had been around since the 1960s, mobile telephony since the 1980s (and earlier if you count radio telephony). What happened was that they became available to everyone.So what will be the next thing that has existed for decades that will change our lives completely? My guess is AI – not the super-smart conscious thing, but the smart agent in your watch or your phone that will do everything for you that you do yourself, from booking a meeting to getting airplane tickets and order stuff for you. With Siri, Alexa, Cortana and Google Assistant, we’re not far off. We’re not quite there yet though: it needs to go one more step and become such an integrated part of your life that you trust it with your life – like you would a butler ofAnd I don’t think that we’re that far off.
