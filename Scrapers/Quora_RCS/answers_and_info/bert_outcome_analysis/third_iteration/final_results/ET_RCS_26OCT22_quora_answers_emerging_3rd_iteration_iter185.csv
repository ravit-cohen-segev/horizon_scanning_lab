0,China is very bureaucratic.This move is probably more about speeding up their growth and helping them deal with the bureaucracy. Basically the same as lobbyists in the US but the other way around.Is it a concern?

1,"Having government officials assigned to your company in china usually means they'll help the company cut the red tape, normally it's the other way around, business have to digging through the red tapes to get things done.However it means very little to Alibaba, a company provides tens of thousands jobs is definitely well connected with the government officials already.","1,234 followers",Osamah Al-Maadeed,832,870,2.5M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Chinas-top-technology-hub-Hangzhou-plans-to-assign-government-officials-to-work-with-100-private-companies-including-the-e-commerce-giant-Alibaba-is-this-a-move-likely-to-raise-concerns-over-the-growing-role-of-the

3,"As an Amazon employee that sees a lot of resumes let me tell you why yours will end up in the trash and you will never get a chance to prove yourself to me. The interview process at these large companies is heavily biased toward weeding out potential good candidates on accident, just to make sure we never end up with a bad hire. One red flag alone COULD be looked over by someone reviewing your resume as long as you have a lot of other good points. The second red flag, I stop reading and dump the resume in the trash. My time is too valuable to waste on a bad resume. Let's start from the top:ParAs an Amazon employee that sees a lot of resumes let me tell you why yours will end up in the trash and you will never get a chance to prove yourself to me. The interview process at these large companies is heavily biased toward weeding out potential good candidates on accident, just to make sure we never end up with a bad hire. One red flag alone COULD be looked over by someone reviewing your resume as long as you have a lot of other good points. The second red flag, I stop reading and dump the resume in the trash. My time is too valuable to waste on a bad resume. Let's start from the top:Part-time programmer' - What do you do with the other part of your time? I don't want to work with someone that doesn't even care enough about this industry to do it full time. This is also a red flag that you could be the person that always comes in late and leaves early and always seems to be behind on their work. This is not a good impression to leave.Ok, I am done tearing your resume apart and I apologize if anything I said above hurts your feelings. But, I want you to understand why you won't get a job at Google, Amazon, Facebook, <insert top tier company here> as your resume sits.If you really want to work at one of these companies you should do a couple things. First, change your resume so the major red flags I pointed out above are a little less obvious. If you need help with this, there are lots of online resources for writing quality resumes. Second, you should consider getting a job with a real software company. Doing Freelance work can be rewarding if that is what you want to do for the rest of your life, but you want to work for a big software company so why are you doing it? Go get some relevant job experience to make up for the lack of formal education. This will do wonders for getting your resume out of the trash bin and into the consider pile. As it stands, the only way you will ever get an in-person interview again is to impress another recruiter at a coding competition.I really do wish you the best of luck in getting that dream job you are after. But like most dreams, they don't come for free so work hard and you will get there eventually.",74 followers,Christopher Franklin,4.6K,0,0,2015,https://www.quora.com/Chinas-top-technology-hub-Hangzhou-plans-to-assign-government-officials-to-work-with-100-private-companies-including-the-e-commerce-giant-Alibaba-is-this-a-move-likely-to-raise-concerns-over-the-growing-role-of-the

5,"Ah, the lovely resume. I’ve seen more than a few thousands of these and while a resume rarely ever tells the entire story, you can definitely optimize it to be more effective.As a recruiter for one of those “big tech” companies, here are some things I’d suggest that almost always catch my attention.Ah, the lovely resume.
