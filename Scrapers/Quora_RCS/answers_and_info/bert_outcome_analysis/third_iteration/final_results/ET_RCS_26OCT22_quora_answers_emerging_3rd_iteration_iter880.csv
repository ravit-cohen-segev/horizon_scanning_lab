1,"Aren’t they already? Africa has nuclear reactors, aircraft manufacturers, software developers, extensive data networks, and Africans are global leaders in mobile payment adoption.What Africans aren’t is wealthy, so while the continent sees significant technological sophistication, its penetration and distribution are spotty and uneven. You find a lot of advanced technology in, say, South Africa, Egypt, and Nigeria, but not so much in Mali or Togo.","246,832 followers",Dushka Zapata,1.5K,8.5K,232.4M,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-will-be-the-next-technological-advancement-in-smartphones-after-full-Bezelless-mobiles-are-prevalent-in-market
2,"Isaac Asimov argued that the only really important scientific discovery was made in 1752 when Benjamin Franklin published his paper that showed lightning was an electrical phenomenon.This, as they say, changed everything. Prior to this, scientific discoveries were only of importance to other scientists. They had no real relationship to people as a whole. Sure, the church might object when Galileo published his work about a heliocentric universe, but it didn’t make an impression on the public as a whole.But Franklin’s discovery led to a very practical useThis is one of Franklin’s “lightning rodIsaac Asimov argued that the only really important scientific discovery was made in 1752 when Benjamin Franklin published his paper that showed lightning was an electrical phenomenon.This, as they say, changed everything.

It was a device that, get this, stopped lightning from striking buildings.It spread like…. oh, I don’t know… lightning maybe? Within a decade only churches weren’t using them because, you know, they thought lighting was divine and specific retribution from god. However, after lightning struck a church where gunpowder was being stored (because, you know, god LIKES churches) even they started adopting the darn things.The idea that science could solve practical problems started with the lightning rod and before long, that weird phenomenon called “electricity” turned out to have all kinds of uses:Like motors that didn’t need flamesBright, cheap, safe lightingBlazingly fast calculating machines","46,107 followers",Steven Haddock,12.9K,25.6K,343.3M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-will-be-the-next-technological-advancement-in-smartphones-after-full-Bezelless-mobiles-are-prevalent-in-market
3,"As of yesterday it’s no longer “next”.First pig heart being transplanted into a humanYesterday, January 10th, 2022, marks the first time an organ from a genetically modified animal, a pig, was transplanted into a human. We don’t know what will happen, but the pig was genetically modified in a way that makes it unlikely the organ will be rejected by the recepient and pig organs in general are quite similar to our own.I hope the recipient lives a rich full life with his new heart of a pig. Even if not, this is still a major step forward towards generating organs to order, without fear of rejectiAs of yesterday it’s no longer “next”.First pig heart being transplanted into a humanYesterday, January 10th, 2022, marks the first time an organ from a genetically modified animal, a pig, was transplanted into a human.

Even if not, this is still a major step forward towards generating organs to order, without fear of rejection. Even if the heart is rejected and the donor dies, what we learn from the process will enable us to succeed the next time. I reckon this will become the mainstream way we get spare parts by the end of the decade in an optimistic scenario, by the end of the next decade in the pessimistic one.Either way, the moment is as groundbreaking as December 3rd, 1967, when the first human heart ever was transplanted, ushering the era of organ transplants of today. That patient died after 18 days, I hope this guy does better.","29,930 followers",Tomaž Vargazon,5.9K,7.7K,249.7M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-will-be-the-next-technological-advancement-in-smartphones-after-full-Bezelless-mobiles-are-prevalent-in-market

Just recently a future breakthrough occurred where deepmind (google AI) beat its opponent by using a form of intuition.Google’s DeepMind now showing human-like characteristicsNot much fan fare was made of this, however, it is the beginning of AI’s ability to process information intuitively which makes it appear more human. This is an isolated example of AI’s advancement but just think about it. By 2025–2030 computers will theoretically be able to process information as fast as the human mind. Just think how much processing power will exist by 2050.If you combine the future processing power of AI with the ability to think more human like you have something really good…or…something really bad. No matter what the big breakthrough is, at its core, will be artificial intelligence.AI will drive transformations in transportation, communications, medical, banking, and other markets. In fact these transformations have already begun. As futurist Gerd Leonhard said, “there will be more change in the next 20 years than the past 300 years.Futurist: More changes in next 20 years than last 300At first one would think this comment a bit outrageous. However, I look at all the changes that took place in my grandmothers life. She was born in a house with no running water. She spent her first 40 years of life without electricity. When she died she was able to send emails and browse the Internet. Though there is debate if Moore’s law is still valid we do know that technology is moving at a more rapid pace than ever before. With the advent of AI I can see how change and disruption will be dramatic and mind boggling.I know I didn’t answer the question directly. Maybe another can take a stab at it based on AI’s foundation.",UNKNOWN,Ernest W. Adams,866,44.2K,248.7M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-upcoming-breakthroughs-in-the-world-of-Technology

The difference between an analogue watch and a digital one is irrelevant to most people.Paying with a credit card or paying cash serves the service more than the customer.A totally new form of energy will not change the world for those who just switch it on an off.Breakthroughs are relevant to the user when they have a personal application. Health is probably the main area where we will be aware of them.To that extent the fact that we are all going to become Cyborgs within the next fifty years is something that will come as a shock to many.The implications are many. On death we will be harvested for the machines and implants in our bodies.We will have less fear of death in the knowledge that we live on in a dissected afterlife. And also in the knowledge that we are not forgotten.The morals and philosophies embedded in our social mores will need reassessing.In all, it will be breakthroughs in Social attitudes that will change our lives forever.","20,170 followers",Sriraman Madhavan,4.1K,186,7.9M,2014,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-upcoming-breakthroughs-in-the-world-of-Technology

7,"Raising the efficiency of solar cells to the point that coal and gas-fired electricity production simply can't compete and the Koch Brothers’ portfolio sinks like a stone. We need to drive the greenhouse gas industries clear out of business.
