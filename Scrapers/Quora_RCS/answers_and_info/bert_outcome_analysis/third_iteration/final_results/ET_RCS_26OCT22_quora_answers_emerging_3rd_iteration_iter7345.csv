Reason: During the china ban I lost upwards of $4000 in 2 days. I wasnt watching the market then.5.If I had kept my initial investment of stellarlumens, XRP, Doge and sold them during the highs of bull run, I would have had a chance to retire.Ps: It dint happen, I was too scared.6. I now expect long term returns rather than short term.7.There is life outside crypto, I traded day and night to lose it all in few days. I work and trade now. I’m actually more confident about trading than I was before.I think this should be good. One more thing. Crypto dint have much impact on my life due to my own decisions but I’ve learned too much financial management from it.","51,548 followers",Elena Ledoux,27.7K,6.4K,99.8M,2019,https://www.quora.com/How-did-crypto-change-your-life

Now I’m devoted to becoming better at the craft of investing in Cryptocurrency because it showed me how dedicating time to a skill of research and investment can I’m fact change a life. I’ll be able to pay my through college each year due to my investments and sometimes day trading in currency.

It will facilitate faster financial transactions. It cannot be counterfeited.Google Countries such as Russia and the People's Republic of China, Central Banks, andCryptoCurrency is MASSIVE! A Solution not a Trend. To put it simply, it is your Money in Digital Form. It will empower those people who have No Bank Accounts. It will facilitate faster financial transactions. It cannot be counterfeited.Google Countries such as Russia and the People's Republic of China, Central Banks, and the economic analysts and groups, such as the Gulf Cooperation Council, have expressed a desire to see an independent new currency replace the dollar as the reserve currency.WHY CRYPTOCURRENCY?Let's be clear, the only reason government is open to crypto-currency is because they see it as a way to instill MORE control. They have no other choice. The Federal Reserve Scam is failing. Inflation is about to burst. Monopolizing the money supply is about to come back and haunt the USA like most people can't even fathom.The elites didn't just wake up one day and decide they're against tyranny. They're addicted to it. Crypto-currency outside of government (less control) & those being created by governments (more control) will soon begin competing. The idea of a programmable and completely transparent money to control the masses is like waving a cutting edge nuke in front of a power-hungry dictator. The revolutionary aspect of this technology will be decided by the people.We can conform to the upcoming ""FedCoin"" and further embed our status of money slaves, or we can choose those currencies OUTSIDE the governments and take back our power.But What's Really FUNNY is........""ONLY"" the Top 20 Universities in the U.S. such Harvard, Princeton, Yale, etc... has now made it ""MANDATORY"" for their Students to Learn & Take Courses in ""Crypto-Currencies"".","44,123 followers",Josh Fechter,11.3K,591,17.7M,2019,https://www.quora.com/How-did-crypto-change-your-life
4,"I was 18, last year when i bought parts for my PC and bought GPU along with it just to mine BTC.Later I realised that I made a huge mistake. At first i didn't knew that mining BTC with GPU was outdated (due to the high difficulty rate). One will require ASIC for that. You wont believe but I was mining BTC with 33MHash/sec (this hash rate is that of ETH as i dont remember that of BTC). which would have taken around 16 years to mine one BTC. LOL. But I was lucky, I was free on electricity cost as I was in college hostel.Anyways, later I shifted to Ethereum mining and continued to mine it unlessI was 18, last year when i bought parts for my PC and bought GPU along with it just to mine BTC.Later I realised that I made a huge mistake.

I imported it to my wallet.Also I mined Electronium and Monero. I have around 6k Electronium coins and 12 Monero coins.Coming back to your question, How did CC changed my life?Well, they did nothing in particular in order to change my life, in the other way around they made it more worse because i had to sell the GPUs and I was left with 3 types of coins and with no use as trading is now not allowed.IT IS THE EXPERIENCE and KNOWLEDGE that i gained in this process that helped me a lot to know about the CC. There is no doubt CC will be the future. No, not today but someday when people will realise that really its their money not that of those banks or government that it should be in control of them. But the only thing that needs to be corrected is the trading part of it and the taxation involved with that.BUY or MINE even a bit of any currency this will really connect you to the Blockchain world.And if you want to invest to gain some profit go with some emerging coins likeGood Luck.Feel free to ask more, Grow more.","41,554 followers",Rakshith Akira,23.8K,467,18.3M,2019,https://www.quora.com/How-did-crypto-change-your-life

The world is only now starting to comprehend all of the potential of crypto and blockchain, and not all service providers have yet incorporated these technologies. But, believe me, all of this is unavoidable, since the benefits of contemporary technology are evident. Others are anticipated to follow the banking industry, which was the first to embrace cryptocurrencies. One of the next areas of our lives will change the rules of the game. Now, a new game trend known as Game-Fi, or play to earn, is gaining traction.This is undoubtedly a favorable aspect that can enhance gaming as an area of amusement and revenue. What effect will this have on games? It's simple: gamers will now be able to play for money, allowing them to monetize their time. In the context of human life, this may imply giving up a job and spending more time playing games where players may have pleasure.Of course, I didn't understand all that. I was lucky enough to find out about the RedAttack project, whose beta is about to start. The idea of the game struck me as an ordinary shooter will become a source of not only fun, but also earnings.
