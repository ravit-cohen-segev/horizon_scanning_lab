Gene editing will become more feasible and even more acceptable, leading to fewer genetic disorders and healthier kids. Space travel will become cheaper and easier, enabling us to expand our economies into space.

The CP will continually accelerate in space, so we will be able to reach Mars in less than a day, and people will be leaving for day-shifts mining on the moon and then return home for supper on the same day. A single spacecraft propelled by a CP will be capable of launching into space 5 or 6 times in a single day. We will be able to clean up the orbiting space debris and a spacecraft propelled by a CP will be capable of deflecting asteroids that pose a threat of colliding with Earth.I took my prototype to my nation’s capital, Ottawa, in June 2018, and met with two government officials. One of these fellows is a smart guy with 4 degrees, two of which are in physics and in engineering. During the meeting he kept repeating, “You are going to win the Nobel Prize”.Before the end of October of this year, I should have a prototype that is more than just a proof-of-concept prototype. This newer version will be capable of actually lifting something into the air.The CP will replace all rockets and jet engines. It will replace most air and marine propellers. It will be used for commercial and domestic lifting purposes.It has gone largely ignored because my current proof-of-concept prototype is not very impressive to view, that is, unless you understand the full implications of what it is that I have done. So it has been very difficult to get the interest and attention of industry leaders like Elon Mush and Jeff Bezos. But I am sure that when the media start to show my latest version (I call it 2.0) then I am certain that it will not be ignored.","5,360 followers",Valerio Cietto,677,2.4K,9.1M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-will-be-the-next-big-technological-breakthrough-that-changes-all-our-lives-like-smartphones-did

Even if not, this is still a major step forward towards generating organs to order, without fear of rejection. Even if the heart is rejected and the donor dies, what we learn from the process will enable us to succeed the next time. I reckon this will become the mainstream way we get spare parts by the end of the decade in an optimistic scenario, by the end of the next decade in the pessimistic one.Either way, the moment is as groundbreaking as December 3rd, 1967, when the first human heart ever was transplanted, ushering the era of organ transplants of today.

But the day is not far away when anyone would be able to just walk into a local electronics store and pick up such devices for themselves. (For the lazier ones among us, there’s always Amazon :P)For a couple of years now, electronics giants such as Samsung and LG have been chasing the Holy Grail of producing phones with diaphanous displays. They have achieved success but only upto a point.Here’s a semi-transparent phone that LG launched in 2009.It was called the GD 900 and it had a transparent dial-pad. It didn’t have a fully transparent form-factor but it showed the world that such devices could (and would) exist sometime in the near future.The main issue that manufacturers are facing in making the entire device see-through is making all the internal components i.e. the wires, the capacitors, the processors, the camera sensor, the battery, etc. transparent.Polytron Technologies, a Taiwanese electronics manufacturer, created a prototype in 2013 which featured a fully transparent display.This one is much closer to the generic transparent phone we imagine. But as can be seen in the image above, the SD card, battery and other components are still glaringly visible.Obviously, there is still some way for manufacturers to go before they manage to make completely see-through devices. But it will happen sooner or later.And then Tony Stark will not be the only one who can do this:Cheers :)Images source: Google","68,778 followers",Kanthaswamy Balasubramaniam,898,17.3K,413.3M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-next-technology-after-Salesforce-Technology-goes-out-of-the-trend
9,"Have you ever seen a personal computer from the 1970s? Here’s the Commodore PET from 1977. It came with 8K of RAM, and a tape deck for storage.The IBM Personal Computer in 1981 didn’t replace the PET with a wholly different thing. But it did make improvements, and of course, as an independent development, no compatibility between them. But that’s the default. New things replace old, they don’t cooperate with old.The Macintosh in 1984 also didn’t toss out the idea of the personal computer, but it made improvements.So did the Amiga computer.Laptop computers didn’t change the whole idea, either.Have you ever seen a personal computer from the 1970s?

New things replace old, they don’t cooperate with old.The Macintosh in 1984 also didn’t toss out the idea of the personal computer, but it made improvements.So did the Amiga computer.Laptop computers didn’t change the whole idea, either. They did come up with a name for the class of personal computer: “laptop” or, later on, “notebook.” But they were still personal computers.And 42 years later, we still have laptops, which are still personal computers.Along the way, we added another new subclass, the tablet. They’re still personal computers, but there has been a revolution along the way, even if it happened a bit at a time.Sometimes we took a branch off to make something new, but still kind of the same thing. Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs) were very low performance personal computers. We didn’t want to say “PC” most of the time with these. Except Microsoft, who initially called them “Pocket PC”, because, yes, they were pocket personal computers. Still faster and more capable than that old PET 2001.Today we have these things. They’re still personal computers as well, but they also got another subclass name: smartphone. Why? Well, they are personal computers with several data radio modems, one of which uses the same kind of cellular networks that cellphones used, back when plain old cellphones were a thing.One of the reasons you know a thing is a personal computer is that it can adapt to nearly any purpose, given time. Compared to that PET 2001, your phone — I have an Honor Magic4 Pro phone here in my hand — isn’t the same thing at all. And yet, yes it is. I can chose the programs I want to run on it, I can personalize it, and it’s mine, not something owned by my company, my university, etc. It’s vastly more powerful than the PET, the IBM PC, the Macintosh, the Grid, the Amiga, etc. And yes, it can be used as a telephone (though in fact, being a European model in the USA, not so much), but that’s kind of a side effect of having a data network. In fact, in about a week, the voice networks on my cellular carrier, T-Mobile, go away forever. It’s all computer from here on, all data!I will make the claim that the Personal Computer represented a major change in the way computers are used, marking the smart of the second generation. And that smartphones did as well, being part of the third generation. Those generations were about access and portability, though, not the fact that you’re using a computer:Of course, these are just my distinctions. None of this happened all at once, but over time. The first members of a new generation weren’t terribly useful yet. I could have a typical PDA with me all the time, but it didn’t network. Networking was a completely different technological revolution that overlays all of personal computing today.So whatever comes next, it’ll probably start out kind of crappy, and it’ll be made from the personal computers we use today, but if it’s a true revolution, it’ll drive that evolution to new places. The one I have in mind is this:In short, it’s a revolution not in wide-area communications, not in computing power, not in mobility, but more than anything, a revolution in man-machine communications. That’s happened before, and in fact, continuously. The GUIs in Amiga, Macintosh, and Windows were a huge change. The GUIs in mobile devices, especially tablets and smartphones, were a predictable but important change as well, a compromise in efficiency necessary to enable mobility. Along the way we got other interfaces, like good speech recognition between machine and man.The ultimate end is to eliminate the interface, or at least as much of the interface as possible, and connect machine to our brains. I don’t know if we’re jacking in, entering enhanced AR/VR, sticking anIn fact, if we’re going the VR/AR way next, that’s already a thing.
