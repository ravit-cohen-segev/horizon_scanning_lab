However, it’s not just Bitcoin that’s caught everyone’s attention, as Ethereum makes it move as the next big cryptocurrency.The Ether price (ETH/USD) is currently atThe Growth of AltcoinsSince Q4 of 2020, the Bitcoin (BTC) market capitalization’s dominance grew from a low 57% to levels above 70% on January 2nd. However, the main cryptocurrency started to lose ground in favor of altcoins this year. In other words, the buying interest was shifting from Bitcoin to altcoins.Among the latter, the Ether cryptocurrency is certainly one of the best performers this year. Its performance is only comparable to that of cryptocurrencies involved in the Decentralized Finance (DeFi) economy. Among the best performing DeFi projects/tokens, we have:– The lending platform Aave and its native token: AAVE/USD is up 2-fold YTD– The Decentralized Exchange (DEX) Uniswap and its native token: UNI/USD is up 90% YTD– The price Oracle Chainlink and its native token: LINK/USD is up 70% YTD– The cross-chain interoperability project Polkadot and its governance token: DOT/USD is up 66% YTDThe DeFi CrazeThe price momentum observed is not specific to Ether, but to most tokens of the DeFi economy. The number of ETHs and BTCs locked in DeFi,Since the start of the DeFi craze in June 2020, the number of transactions on the Ethereum blockchain has been flirting with the highest levels reached with theScaling up EthereumTo answer this challenge, Layer 2 (L2) protocols have been developed to accommodate the limited processing capacity of the main blockchain network (aka Mainnet), which are built on top of the Ethereum base protocol which is Layer 1 (L1). L2 protocols allow more throughput (50 to 100-fold), instant confirmation of transactions on L2, andSeveral private L2s emerged since CryptoKitties, and are now used by the most successful DeFi projects. DeFi projects have been structuring their L2 contracts to enforce many of the risk and legal controls needed to safeguard their ecosystem. So much progress has been made that the most advanced projects could hope one day to compete with their peers in the traditional economy, on a similar legal level… The undeniable success of these projects did put Ethereum back in the spotlight.Eth 2.0 UpgradeIn the meantime, in addition to existing operational L2 protocols (e.g. Plasma used by Polkadot), the ETH 2.0 ongoing upgrades are bringing even more scalability to the ecosystem. These upgrades started with the launch of the Beacon Chain on December 1st. The Beacon chain introduced the Proof-Of-Stake mechanism (PoS) that will eventually replace the current Proof-Of-Work (PoW) mechanism. In a PoW system similar to the Bitcoin blockchain, transactions are verified by “miners”. They use computer hardware to mine the new blocks, verify, write transactions to each block and then add the completed block to the chain. In a PoS system, transactions are verified by validators. Agents can stake tokens for the right to validate transactions, and the larger the stake, the higher the number of transactions allocated to the agent for validation and the higher their potential reward.2.1 million ETHs (or $2.7 billion) have already been staked in the Beacon chain. It is still a fraction of the 114 million total supply estimated byInstitutional InterestStill, it takes more than the success of the Beacon chain and the DeFI economy to explain why the ETH value doubled since its launch on December 1st. As always in the cryptocurrency world, the strongest rallies are the consequence of a set of material circumstances that draw interest from both the decentralized and traditional economies. For reference, the rally that sent the BTC price to new ATHs in Q3-Q4 2020 was partially triggered by both the amount of Wrapped Bitcoins (WBTC) generated and locked in DeFi, as well as the exceptional rising interest from institution-grade investors, including Square, Paypal and MassMutual.Like a Bitcoin investment, an Ether investment essentially diversifies a portfolio. Ether is already associated with Bitcoin in several funds or ETPs. The recently launched Bitwise 10 Crypto Index Fund invests ~13% of its $538 million assets (AUMs) in Ethereum, whilst Grayscale’s Digital Large Cap Fund has already 338.4million AUMs with at least 13% invested in ETH. According toBefore I continue, I know Many people do not know there are various ways they can benefit from the investment of bitcoin. For example, investing your coin on a platform like cryptomax(www.cryptomax.tech) where your invested coin will be doubled in 7 days. Try it and thank me later.The reason for this increased interest is that Ether is very liquid. It is also the second most popular cryptocurrency after Bitcoin, making it a natural choice for institution-grade investors or High Net Worth Individuals (HNWIs) looking for diversification in the crypto space. A strong indication of institutional interest would be confirmed with the CME launch of ETH futures on 8th February. Already, the open interest (OI) of existing derivative markets, operated by online exchanges, has hit record highs.The Potential to Follow in BTC’s FootstepsThere is no doubt that the high leverage associated with the high OI is contributing to the ETH price volatility. Recent downside shocks have been exacerbated by derivative contracts liquidations: $228 million of ETH-based long contracts and their collateral were liquidated on the 19th, preceded by $550 million on January 10th. Such high liquidation events typically involve the panic sale of collateral (ETH) that drives the market further down.Despite the high volatility, assuming a level of market access and regulation for ETH and its derivatives that is comparable to Bitcoin, it is difficult to believe that Ether would not experience the same dynamic as Bitcoin over the next two years.Certainly, the tokenomics of Ether are substantially different than Bitcoin’s, starting with Ether’s infinite potential supply. Furthermore, there is still uncertainty with respect to the role and economics of ETH in the new ETH2.0 framework. Nonetheless, now is the time for increased scrutiny – and one could assume that there is no better way to track a cryptocurrency than to own at least a few.","1,875 followers",Jerry A Lawson,1.7K,0,0,2021,https://www.quora.com/Why-do-people-think-Ethereum-will-ever-rival-Bitcoin

It is the most expensive cryptocurrency and it actually has the highest market cap. Bitcoin has also been the most resilient. It has the ability to drive the market up or down. If people start taking money out of Bitcoin, expect the whole market to come down. The vice versa also happens. With Bitcoins recently mempool always being full along with the transactions being so expensive, people are looking for other routes. There are upgrades that are expected to fix this but it doesn’t seem like it will be here anytime soon. This is called Lightning Networking and it will have an effect on many other cryptocurrencies too.What is Ethereum Used for?Ethereum was created by Vitalik Buterin and released in 2015. It is an open source public blockchain that lets people build on the blockchain. It can also be used a digital currency which it is at times. For example, if you decide to create an ICO with your own tokens, you will want people to buy your tokens somehow. You are thinking with a credit card but in cryptocurrencies, ICO’s are traded and paired with Ether usually. This means 1 eth is equal to a certain amount of your tokens. You must send your eth to a specific ICO address and receive your tokens that way.

There is a lot of money pouring into this space, and it doesn’t seem to be slowing down anytime soon.Unfortunately, while the masses may be able to say, “Yeah, I’ve heard of Bitcoin,” a large percentage of people still aren’t quite sure what it is—and are even more confused about Ethereum.After much investigations and research i have made about how to earn more profit on cryptocurrency legitimately, I will recommend CryptoExchangeFX Cryptocurrency Investment Platform (www.cryptoexchangefx,com) as it is relatively on for a while now (launched at mid-summer 2017) but has become the largest Cryptocurrency Investment Platform right now (total volume over 120 million dollars) where you get 20% profit of your invested cryptocurrency after every 10 days. It supports variety of cryptocurrency like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin and other Altcoins. I find that it has a really nice UI and support.BitcoinThe easiest way to define Bitcoin is to call it a “digital dollar.” That’s really all it is—minus all the formal regulations that come with a bank (which is what makes it such a disruptive concept). It’s not a technology. It’s not a company. It’s your money, held in a digital form.Anyone can create an account to buy and sell Bitcoin through websites like Coinbase. The price of Bitcoin then fluctuates based on supply and demand. However, now people are beginning to convert their Bitcoin into what are called “tokens,” which companies issue during an ICO, or Initial Coin Offering, which allows people to invest in a company by purchasing tokens with their Bitcoin. Based on the supply and demand of those tokens, their price (just like a share of stock after a company holds an Initial Public Offering, otherwise known as an IPO) goes up or down. These tokens operate on a secondary market, separate from the rise and fall of Bitcoin’s market as a currency.Some people buy Bitcoin because they want to store their money somewhere other than a bank. Some buy Bitcoin as an investment, believing that its price a few months or years from now will be substantially higher than it is today. And some people purchase Bitcoin as a means of investing in companies that raise money through an ICO, since equity in those companies cannot be purchased with traditional currency. You can only purchase tokens with Bitcoin or Ether, which is Ethereum’s cryptocurrency.EthereumEthereum is another cryptocurrency, and one many people see as potentially overtaking Bitcoin as the dominant coin in the market.In any economy, currency is relative. Since Bitcoin has been the leading coin since the beginning, the price of every other “altcoin” (and there are a lot of them) is measured against Bitcoin. Take Litecoin, for example. It is a currency that has its own market and holds its own merit, but while Bitcoin is priced at over $3,000 per, Litecoin currently sits around $45 per. So, while it has its own value, it is by no means a market leader.What makes Ethereum different is its technology, not the fact that it’s yet another cryptocurrency. Ethereum’s coin value is referred to as “Ether,” and just like Bitcoin is bought and sold, and used by investors to buy into ICO opportunities.The difference between Ethereum and Bitcoin is the fact that Bitcoin is nothing more than a currency, whereas Ethereum is a ledger technology that companies are using to build new programs. Both Bitcoin and Ethereum operate on what is called “blockchain” technology, however Ethereum’s is far more robust. If Bitcoin was version 1.0, Ethereum is 2.0, allowing for the building of decentralized applications to be built on top of it.In a nutshell: it’s great for innovation.What has so many people—including me—excited about Ethereum’s technology is its potential to impact IoT projects and processes. It’s by no means a perfect technology yet, but it has absolutely opened the door for all sorts of unique innovations. For example, my firm, Chronicled, recently worked with a 3D-printing company, Origin, to develop a ‘smart tag’ for sneakers and luxury goods that could guarantee their authenticity. This was done leveraging Ethereum’s blockchain technology.All in all, and if you’re as curious and excited about this space as I am, the major difference between Bitcoin and Ethereum is their separation of roles—and the fact that they are aiming at parallel but different goals. This article on the topic summed it up perfectly, by citing that early adopters are beginning to see the separation as such: “Where Bitcoin is disrupting currency, Ethereum is disrupting equity.”","1,613 followers",Carpenco Dima,1K,66,2.8M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Why-do-people-think-Ethereum-will-ever-rival-Bitcoin

Everyone can see the transactions, although you do not know who the coded addresses are.Depending on how the cryptocurrency you are interested in works, some sort of work has to be done in order to create blocks and add them to the blockchain. This work is done by miners. These are computers attached to the network that take transaction data and process it into the blocks. When they do they get a reward, some bitcoin. Because the computations involved get more difficult as time passes, it becomes increasingly more expensive to do mining. You need specialised hardware, you need cheap power, you need space and cooling for all of these machines.Mining bitcoin for profit means being able to be efficient enough, with the right equipment, the cheap electricity and the cooling (or ability to sell your waste heat) to be able to process enough transactions to have some value left over once you have done it.You used to be able to mine bitcoin using a desktop computer, not any more.There are other cryptocurrencies, like Chia, which I have mined, although we call it “farming” because it does not rely on heavy processor intensive cryptography (called proof of work) which bitcoin and most cryptocurrencies use. Chia and other newer cryptos work by proof of space. So instead of using huge amounts of electricity to calculate things, I am using up huge amounts of hard drive space to earn coins. I have earned about $400 worth of coins by devoting around 160TB of hard drive space to the effort. The data stored on the hard drives has no inherent value, which is one weakness of the technology but its power consumption is much more modest.This website shows you how much power turns into how much bitcoin (BTC):If I put in the roughly 2000kWh I have used to farm Chia and get $400 worth of coins I would only manage to get $0.72 worth of bitcoin.This is why I am backing proof of space, over proof of work, eventually the world will want a crypto that works and does not use all the power, which is a bigger problem than using a bunch of hard drives.",0 followers,Melissa Aldridge,501,0,0,2021,https://www.quora.com/Why-do-people-think-Ethereum-will-ever-rival-Bitcoin

7,"In a bitcoin network, transactions make up the record that is stored by every node participating in the network.

What do they do, they verify transactions and add blocks to the existing blockchain present. In return, these miners get rewards in the form of newly generated bitcoin. The total supply of bitcoin is capped at a figure of 21 million, whereas the circulating supply is much less than this. Miners bring newly minted coins into the circulation. Just like mining for extracting gold, bitcoin miners extract bitcoins.There are plenty of miners in the bitcoin network, so how do they get rewards? The answer, they compete.In order to add a block to the existing blockchain and get rewards, miners compete to find a specific number known as ‘nonce’. When this number is combined with the data of the block and is passed through a hash function, the output has to fall within a certain range. This nonce number can be anywhere between 0 and 4,294,967,296.Whichever blocks find this nonce number first gets to add the block in the blockchain and is selected for the rewards. But finding this number is much harder than it sounds. Random guesses are made by the miners to find the correct nonce number. There is a possibility that there might be more than one nonce number that give the correct output, and there is also a possibility that there is no nonce that gives that correct output when combined with the block data and passed through the hash function. In such a scenario, different block configuration is tried by the miners.As evident, computing power plays a major role in all of this. A mining node with large computing power has a greater chance of finding the correct number. It takes an average of 10 minutes to mine a block. With every block added, the number of bitcoin in circulation increases. It is expected that all the 21 million bitcoins will be in circulation sometime around 2140Miners remove the need of a central controlling party and hence, bitcoin provides a system that is tamper-proof, transparent and decentralized. It provides a global framework of currency transcending the borders. Now it remains to be seen how much it is able to integrate the current traditional financial framework with all the possibilities that it provides.",UNKNOWN,Daniel Augustine (UR),5.2K,309,1.3M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Why-do-people-think-Ethereum-will-ever-rival-Bitcoin
8,"First, the miner takes an unverified transaction out of the unverified transactions pool and verifies it.  This involves tracking back through the blockchain to make sure the sender actually has the bitcoins being sent, checking that the sender is actually the sender and not someone pretending to be him (this through the use of digital signatures), and checking that the recipient is a valid ‘wallet’ that can accept the transfer.  It then copies that transaction to the block it is building and picks the next unverified transaction in the pool and repeats the validation process on it.When it hasFirst, the miner takes an unverified transaction out of the unverified transactions pool and verifies it.

It then copies that transaction to the block it is building and picks the next unverified transaction in the pool and repeats the validation process on it.When it has amassed the requisite number of transactions to comprise a full block (I’m not sure what that number is at the moment, but it is probably around 500), the miner hashes each transaction.  That just means it applies a standard piece of code (SHA256) against the transaction, which calculates a hash, an otherwise meaningless 256-bit number.  It does this for all transactions in the block.Then it pairs each of the hashes it just produced, and calculates a new hash for each hash pair.  There are now half as many hashes.  It repeats this by pairing the new hashes and hashing them.  Now there are a quarter as many.  It continues doing this, halving the number of hashes each time until it is left with just one hash.  The process is called building a Merkle Tree, and the final resulting hash is called the Merkle Root, named after the guy who conceived it.  (To clarify: His name is Ralph Merkle, not Merkle Root.)Now the miner takes the ID of the previous block in the block chain (ie: the current highest block in the chain), the Merkle Root it just calculated, a time stamp, and a random number called a nonce, and it hashes allIf and when the miner’s hash finally meets the condition, the miner shouts ‘Bingo!’ (that’s a technical software term) and appends his new block to the top end of the existing blockchain.  As a reward, he gets to keep an amount of newly minted bitcoins — the coinbase — as well as any transaction fees embedded in the transactions in the new block.  This is the incentive for miners to keep on mining.But there is a catch.  (Isn’t there always?)While the miner is doing this, hundreds of other miners are busily doing the same thing.  But only one new block can be validated, so it becomes a race to see who can do all those hashing computations the fastest.  When some miner shouts Bingo, all other miners stop what they are doing and check his work.  It only requires one hash calculation to do that as the nonce that gave the winning number is visible in the new block’s header.This explains why a lot of miners useBut what if two miners create a new block atI hope this helps.

And define a transaction that has a 1.5BTC output to Bob and the remainder back to herself (any remaining BTC that does not have an output is claimed by the miner as a transaction fee).

If any of the inputs are already used or the transaction is in some other way invalid, the miner will discard it.  If everything checks out the miner will probably include the transaction in the block it is mining.Miners then group those transactions into pairs and hash them together (including one special transaction called the coinbase transaction).  The coinbase transaction is a transaction that sends 25BTC (currently) to the miner as a reward for processing this block. Then they hash pairs of hashes together until they end up with a single hash value for the entire block of transactions.  This structure is called a merkle tree and it is proof of every transaction in the block.  The last hash value is called the merkle root.The miner hashes together the merkle root, the hash of the previous block in the blockchain, and a nonce.  The miners will actually try billions of nonces to try to find the one that makes the hash of the current block they are mining start with a certain number of zeros (depending on the current difficulty).  For most merkle roots there does not exist a nonce that meets the difficulty, so miners will go back and alter the merkle tree by adding transactions or fudging with the coinbase transaction.  Changing the tree means that there will be a new merkle root and they can try all the possible nonces again to try to find a solution.The miner hashes together the merkle root, the hash of the previous block in the blockchain, and a nonce.
