1,"Well, there are, but they tend to become roadkill under the wheels of change. I remember, back at the start of the computer revolution, there were large numbers of people who resisted their introduction. The problem from their company’s perspective was that computers reduced costs dramatically, so the people who resisted change had to go.There were large numbers of managers who insisted they had to have a secretary do their typing and filing.

I remember, back at the start of the computer revolution, there were large numbers of people who resisted their introduction. The problem from their company’s perspective was that computers reduced costs dramatically, so the people who resisted change had to go.There were large numbers of managers who insisted they had to have a secretary do their typing and filing. To save costs, the company got rid of all the secretaries. To replace them, they gave the managers computer terminals. When they objected that they didn’t know how to type or file, the company told them they had a choice between learning to use the computer or taking early retirement. Many found themselves taking early retirement.Nowadays, of course, everyone has a smartphone that can do just as much as an early supercomputer, and they use it all the time, so the information revolution has happened and nobody can live without it any more.In wartime, resisting technological change leads to defeat. Having big, thick walls didn’t work that well for Constantinople when the Ottoman Turks brought their new-fangled gunpowder cannons. Having smooth-bore muskets when the enemy had Springfield rifles with 10 times the range didn’t work that well for Robert E. Lee at Gettysburg. Having fixed fortresses on the Maginot Line when the enemy could just drive around them in tanks didn’t work that well for the French when the Germans invaded in WW2. Having more powerful M14 rifles based on the old WW2 M1 didn’t help the US troops much in Vietnam when the Viet Cong had the new Russian AK-47 assault rifles.Neo-Luddites would like to return to the better days of yesteryear, but I was there and it was pretty bad back then. They want to live off the grid, but I lived off the grid when I was young, and it wasn’t that great carrying buckets of water from the well, using kerosene lamps, and running to the outhouse at 40 below. Eating free range chicken eggs was okay, but chopping the head off your free range chicken and watching it run around in circles before it bleeds out so you can give it to your sisters to pluck and cook on the coal stove wasn’t that good.My old school, which they turned into a museum with dummy students.No running water, a coal furnace the teacher had to stoke, and outhouses out back you had to go to at 40 below. Our sports facilities consisted of swings. We could also play Anti-I-Over on the barn: The object of the game is to throw a ball over the roof of the barn yelling “Anti-I-Over”. Less privileged schools didn’t have a barn for the student’s horses.No, computer learning is much better these days.

2,"No. It has allowed the rapid expansion of the human race, and also easier and longer lives. Without it, we'd still be hunting and eating our food raw.

4,Just one word: “specialize”.No one follows and keeps an updated education in every technology. After you have been working for a while you will have found a niche.

5,"Original question: How can someone get better in tech with all the rapid advancement and emergence of new technologies?My answer:I'm going to keep thing answer short. Don't be afraid of new technology. You will quickly learn that this field requires life long learning. You will never no matter how much experience you have or how much you learn be able to stop learning more. I would go as far as to say that your goal should be how to get good at learning!

The skills you retain in design, documentation, comments, user stories, requirement gathering will help you remember what you did in the past and what you are working on now. The skills you gather in security, data handling, process queues, and frameworks will help you understand scalability. What you learn in algorithms, searching, networking, communications, topology and transformation will help in specific fields AI, cryptography, IoT, VR, and AR. What you learn in devops deployment frameworks, development tools, monitoring, alerts, containers and cloud computing will help you understand production.Those skills and more make new technology easier to understand but it does not remove the need keep learning. Most programs or frameworks rhyme. They remind you of each other but they are different enough that they will take time to learn.

At graduation, the average medical student debt is about $160,000 (sometimes a lot higher). If you’re one of those fortunate graduates – you’re looking at how to pay back what amounts to a home mortgage – in the fastest time possible. Here are your options based on the average annual compensation by specialty.Now, would you like that mortgage paid off in 10 years – or 5? Independent of any noble motivation to “practice medicine,” these are the very real economics within the profession of healthcare. We can change this, of course, but then we better look hard at the cost/benefit equation of medical training. What we have today supports sickcare – not healthcare.

[Footnote: French docs graduate with $0 debt]Demand DistributionAnother problem – primary care and prevention are not where the big healthcare expenses are – and it doesn’t fundamentally change the system.  We’ve also lost a fair amount of time (through the years) chasing the wrong bad guys – the insurance companies – which we conveniently blamed for much of the medical gluttony for the entire industry. Just like low-acuity healthcare – that’s not where the big dollars are being spent (and it’s certainly not where the big net profits are).  Here’s the category breakdown of our National Healthcare Expenditure for 2013The net cost of health insurance is 7%. Nothing to sneeze at to be sure, but if you’re trying to “disrupt” a system that’s running at $3.2T per year (in 2015 - about 18% of GDP) is the insurance industry really the best place to start? Just asking.The net cost of health insurance is 7%.

As such, the only people who can afford to do this kind of work are the research labs of big companies (think Bell Labs in the old days and Google today) and the government. Even startups that raise massive VC rounds don’t have resources anywhere close to what Google or the government can provide.For those of you sharpening your anti-government pitchforks, where do you think the Internet came from? The government funded this experiment for decades without any expectation of profit and gave it to private industry for the rest of us to make money with. Everything we’ve done since then, from Amazon to underwear delivery, stands on the shoulders of profitless government funded research. Creating the Internet was the fundamental development that changed the world, not mailing crap in a box.That’s not to say there won’t be spectacular successes – with big valuations, big exits and windfall profits – but the real question remains. Are they truly disruptive at the core of healthcare– or just around the edges?Contrary to many who say our healthcare system is broken – it really isn’t.The people in it aren’t to blame – and we can absolutely change it – but we have to really want that change. That kind of change is at the core of the system – with different goals, objectives and outcomes in mind. The system we have has been optimized for revenue and profits - not safety and quality.The people in it aren’t to blame – and we can absolutely change it – but we have to really want that change. That kind of change is at the core of the system – with different goals, objectives and outcomes in mind. The system we have has been optimized for revenue and profits - not safety and quality.That’s much less of a technology problem and much more of a process improvement one - and that's a different science. That's the science of process improvement - not economics or technology. Autonomously driven cars can drive on either side of the road - and initially they will need to be programmed to do that to live with manually operated ones. That decision - which side of the road to drive on - isn't a technical or economic one - it's process design.Unfortunately, this kind of change (dare I say disruption?) isn’t one that startups can deliver – and nor should we expect it from them.And,  just like Silicon Valley, the status quo also has a really big source of available capital. It just has a different street address. It’s not Sand Hill Road – it’s K Street. In terms of any attempt at comparison – it’s the difference between grind play on the slot machine (where people can and regularly do hit million dollar jackpots) and the private rooms of Baccarat for the whales that are flown in from around the world on private jets. As long as the whales are having fun – the casino (and status quo) will remain unchanged.All of which is why there's so little ""disruption"" in healthcare.[1]","46,125 followers",Steven Haddock,1.3K,25.6K,343.5M,2016,https://www.quora.com/How-will-humanity-exist-in-the-future-with-exponentially-rising-population-and-greater-technology-emerging
