A network of people who ensure the transactions are securely taking place and there is no disparity.These people are our miners, who use their processing power to maintain security of block chains and to ensure that they keep working properly.Miners are rewarded as well when they help maintain the block chain system.So, basically, Bitcoin as a digital currency eliminates the need of a third party like a bank server, and makes it decentralized. Nobody controls the movement of money this way.Not even Hulk or Batman!",18 followers,Asim Qureshi,848,996,156.1M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-is-Bitcoin-cryptocurrency

4,"Bitcoins are a collection of nodes (master nodes and simple nodes) that are nothing but computers. These computers run the code of Bitcoin and consequently store its blockchain.Each blockchain is a collection of blocks. Each block, in turn, is a collection of transactions. The best thing about this system is its transparency, making it unlikely for anyone (including those who started it) to cheat the system.All the computers that run the blockchain have the same block and transaction list. Everyone (whether they run a “node” or not) can see the new Bitcoin transactions occurring live and filling up the blocks one after the other. Cheating this system is unlikely.Does that mean no one can cheat the Bitcoin System?If a bad actor has to carry out a nefarious action, he/she has to operate 51% of the computing power that makes up the Bitcoin. As of May 2020, there are 47,000 nodes. Therefore, cheating this elaborate system is highly unlikely.Now, suppose a bad actor carries out an attack. In such a case, the people who are running the nodes or the computers will most probably carry out a fork to a new blockchain. This will make the attack a wastage of time, resources, and effort of the bad actor.Absolutely. What are you waiting for? You should invest now because of the following reasons:Almost all analysts are predicting a bull run in 2021 as they are expecting the mass adoption of BTC in the near future.Bitcoin price has increased by around 170% in 2020. If we consider the lows during the COVID-19 crash in March 2020, the bounceback is phenomenal. Since the lows of March, the BTC price against the US Dollar has increased by around 400%.A Bloomberg report says that the analysts of JPMorgan investment bank believe that BTC will continue to gain traction and may present a bear case for gold.“The adoption of bitcoin by institutional investors has only begun, while for gold its adoption by institutional investors is very advanced.”Billions of dollars worth of investment can potentially flow from gold to Bitcoin. Therefore, in the coming time, the gold may lose its shine as BTC’s prospects brighten.On December 10, 2020, the market cap of Bitcoin was US$341,785,729,235, out of the total global market capitalization of US$546,541,275,989. BTC’s market share is 62%, the highest in the cryptocurrency market. Its price movement largely defines the overall movement of the market.Unlike 2017’s bear run (when the BTC value tanked to 3,500-level), this time it’ll be decent corrections. On December 9, 2020, the BTC/USD pair breached the US$18,000 level and moved downwards to US$17,640.56 and at one point in time exchange data showed buyer interest lined up at the US$16,200-level.When asked about the prospects of the Bitcoin market, Cointelegraph Markets analyst Michaël van de Poppe and many others said that their overall estimate is positive because many big investors including Grayscale, Paypal, Square, MicroStrategy, and many others are buying at lower levels as the small crypto “traders, shitcoiners, and weak hands” sell-off.They believe the downtrend will continue until the US$18,500-18,700 level is reclaimed. Currently, the BTC/USD price is revolving around US$18,022.35. So, time your entry by checking the technical charts and you’ll most definitely reap the benefit in the coming year.Yes, you can buy a portion of a single Bitcoin. However, always keep in mind that you’ve to give a certain commission for purchasing BTC. If you are paying US$10 for buying US$10,000 of Bitcoin, it means you are just paying 0.1% in fees. However, if you give US$10 fees for buying US$100 Bitcoin, you’re 10% in fees. While investing US$100, you should keep this thing in mind. This will help you make an informed and better entry into the market and invest properly.If you are a beginner, you can also try","29,209 followers",Mattias Petter Johansson,1.1K,1.1K,16.1M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-is-Bitcoin-cryptocurrency
5,"Currency is money. It has some value. It can be exchanged for goods and services. It can be used to maintain a record of the cost of these goods and services. Earlier we had Gold and other metals as currency. It was later replaced by Paper currency. Now we have Credit Cards.Whenever we give a bill or note (paper currency), the shopkeepers accepts it. They know that they can spend this money again to purchase from some one else. We carry this money in our wallets. We use it wherever we want too. We can use it in the middle of the night. The seller gets paid immediately.Then came credit cards anCurrency is money. It has some value. It can be exchanged for goods and services.

We carry this money in our wallets. We use it wherever we want too. We can use it in the middle of the night. The seller gets paid immediately.Then came credit cards and digital payments. Now you are ranked based upon a score. Banks track your every transaction. They may or may not allow you to do a particular transaction. Credit card companies hold up shopkeeper’s funds for months.Some people decided to create a new form of currency i.e Bitcoin. It is supposed to work as cash i.e. paper currency. Any person can create a wallet. He can load his wallets with Bitcoins and spend at his will. You can purchase it via Dollars, Rupees, Pounds, Yen etc. There is fluctuation in the price of USD/INR, USD/GBP and others depending upon a countries growth, demand for their currency, their expenditure etc. Similarly, the price of Bitcoin fluctuates with its development, adoption, innovation, and usage.Second thing Satoshi Nakamoto wanted was to create a system where no bank or government can control Bitcoin. He achieved by making it decentralised. He published the paper about Bitcoin and asked people to help him with development. Like other open source softwares, developers update Bitcoins. These developers do not work for any body. They write code because they believe Bitcoin can change the world. Hundreds of different developers around the world write and review Bitcoin code and make it more secure and easy for people to use.Banks have their own centralised servers. They may maintain a copy of these servers in different places just to avoid any downtime. We have seen in past how these banks can be hacked and millions of Dollars are poured out of people’s accounts. In Bitcoin, the server is maintained by thousands of computers around the globes. These computers are owned by people like us. Each of these computers have a copy of ledger. The ledger has records of all the transactions that happened with Bitcoin. If somebody needs to hack the Bitcoin, he will have to hack all these computers at once.Now we have a system of unknown and unrelated people who want to transact with each other without the help of any third party. Someone needs to verify these transactions. There are miners which run huge servers for Bitcoin. The purpose of these servers is to verify each transaction and write it in the ledger. As this is an extensive process and requires a lot of computation power, miners get paid for verifying transactions.There is no single person or group of persons who control the Bitcoins. There are many stakeholders. These are people like us. They want to see a new economic system in the world as they believe the current one is broken and outdated. These people do not know each other. They work because they believe in Bitcoins.Legality of Bitcoin is a topic of debate. Many countries recognise Bitcoin but they have not yet declared it as a legal payment method. Japan now identifies Bitcoin as a legal tender. We have Bitcoin ATMs in US, Singapore, Canada and Europe. We have strict Bitcoin rules in China. India is still not decided on its stance on Bitcoin.TLDR;",0 followers,Glen Boston,704,71,1.7M,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-is-Bitcoin-cryptocurrency
6,"Bitcoin is a form of electronic, permissionless, peer-to-peer money.What’s the idea behind it?The idea behind digital money was to create a way to exchange value with the help of the internet. Doing it, people would be able to send and receive money worldwide feeless and without the friction of any intermediaries.At first, Bitcoin solved the trust problem. Apart from the fact that people can transact money directly over the internet with no intermediaries involved, they can also participate in developing the network trying to make it more secure. Thus, Satoshi disappeared being confident thatBitcoin is a form of electronic, permissionless, peer-to-peer money.What’s the idea behind it?The idea behind digital money was to create a way to exchange value with the help of the internet.

Apart from the fact that people can transact money directly over the internet with no intermediaries involved, they can also participate in developing the network trying to make it more secure. Thus, Satoshi disappeared being confident that the development of the network would continue.One of the unique features of BTC is the absence of the leader, as all changes are made through consensus among all network participants. The Bitcoin ecosystem has a large open source developer community, who contribute research, peer review, testing, documentation, and translation. Moreover, according to Electric Capital research conducted in Dec, 2020, it is expanding, having 70%+ more developers than it did 3 years ago.Though,At first, Bitcoin was traded for only a few cents and was mainly used for things like gambling.In 2010, the first online crypto exchange Mt. Gox, was opened.Later, Silk Road (a dark web marketplace for buying and selling drugs) stated using BTC as a method of payment.With the increase of use, BTC's price hit $1 for the first time in spring 2011. It caught the attention of early investors and speculators.New cryptocurrencies were created to compete with BTC or solve other problems. They were called altcoins, as alternatives to Bitcoin.Though the FBI shut down the Silk Road in 2013, it showcased the promise of Bitcoin as a digital payment method.In March 2014, Mt.Gox went bankrupt following a massive hack.Despite the closure of the Silk Road and the collapse of Mt. Gox the crypto space kept expanding.Now there are a lot of pro-crypto people and yet companies accepting Bitcoins, who believe that BTC can alter a global economy with digital money, changing it for the better.How does Bitcoin work?Since Bitcoin is decentralized, volunteers who are called ""miners"" constantly verify and update the blockchain. As soon as a specific amount of transactions are verified, another block is added to the blockchain.BTC's system rewards successful miners with bitcoins. The reward changes over time, halving about every four years. The current reward for a new block of verified transactions is 6.25 BTC. By reducing the rewards of mining bitcoin, halving ensures that the amount of bitcoin in circulation does not increase exponentially, which also tends to put upward pressure on its price.TheIs Bitcoin Legal?Bitcoin ownership and mining are legal in more countries than not. Some examples of places where it is illegal are Algeria, Egypt, Morocco, Bolivia, Ecuador, Nepal, and Pakistan.﻿ Overall, Bitcoin use and mining are legal across much of the globe.How did it appear?Since the code for Bitcoin may have been written in 2007, the first known sign of it came out in August 2008, when the domain name for ""Bitcoin was introduced to the world by a person under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto in October 2008 when he posted a👆 It is interesting to know that he has never intended to invent a currency. In his announcement of Bitcoin in late 2008, Satoshi said that he developed ""A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System"" only.On 3rd Jan 2009,It refers to a headline in The Times newspaper from the same date. It's possible that Nakamoto just picked the first headline he saw in the nearest paper. However, crypto enthusiasts tend to agree it's a statement of intent. The financial crisis of 2008 was still unraveling, and it's assumed that Bitcoin was a reaction to the widespread anger and frustration at the current financial system.9th Jan 2009,12th Jan 2009:In 2010,Having disappeared, Satoshi officially decentralized the network for good. Nakamoto created their last forum post onSatoshi Nakamoto last message on the Bitcoin ForumNakamoto has not been involved in any of the changes since then.Thanks for reading my answer!
