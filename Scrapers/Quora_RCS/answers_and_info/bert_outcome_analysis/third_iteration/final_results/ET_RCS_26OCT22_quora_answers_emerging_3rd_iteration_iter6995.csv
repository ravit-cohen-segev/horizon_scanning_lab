In the case of the Navy, the service has developed a new next-generation, low-drag, guided round called the High-Velocity Projectile (HVP) that it intends to use in conjunction with the railgun.The HVP—which can also be fired from conventional cannons—would be able to hit targets at ranges of over 100 nautical miles at speeds exceeding Mach 6.“That velocity allows projectiles to rely on kinetic energy for maximum effect, and reduces the amount of high explosives needed on ships,” according torailguns rely on electromagnets to launch a metallic projective—dispensing with chemical propellants. In the case of the Navy, the service has developed a new next-generation, low-drag, guided round called the High-Velocity Projectile (HVP) that it intends to use in conjunction with the railgun.The HVP—which can also be fired from conventional cannons—would be able to hit targets at ranges of over 100 nautical miles at speeds exceeding Mach 6.“That velocity allows projectiles to rely on kinetic energy for maximum effect, and reduces the amount of high explosives needed on ships,” according to the ONR.Theoretically, a railgun would allow the Navy to take full advantage of the capabilities of HVP because of the increased amount of launch energy the new weapon should be able to impart to the shell.“With its increased velocity, precision guidance and extended range, the railgun realizes the full range of the HVP's scalable lethality,” the ONR states.According to the ONR, the railgun has already been tested at low muzzle energy while firing multiple shot salvoes—what the Navy calls repetition rate of fires or rep-rates. Now, the Navy hopes to incrementally increase the amount of energy flowing through the weapon while also increasing the salvo size and rate of fire.“Railgun rep-rate testing will be at 20 megajoules by the end of the summer and at 32 megajoules by next year,” an ONR release stated.“To put this in perspective, one megajoule is the equivalent of a one-ton vehicle moving at 160 miles per hour.”“The Navy currently is developing and testing railgun barrels capable of firing many rounds per minute with a tactically relevant barrel life--as well as the associated power and auxiliary systems needed to make that possible,” reads an ONR release","6,480 followers",Michael Soareverix,28.3K,373,6.6M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Which-technology-is-mainly-used-to-create-a-website-in-the-present-time

These may cross interstate or international boundaries and require negotiation and cooperation with governments, municipalities and other organizations.Medical mentorWith the trend toward value-based care, there’s a lot of room for helpers, advocates and mentors in health care, says Jim Lebret, assistant professor of medicine and clinical innovation at NYU Medical Center and director of code team leaders at Bellevue Hospital in New York City.Self-driving car mechanicWhile self-driving cars will eliminate many jobs, such as those of taxi drivers and couriers, they will create a few as well, Austin says. But these cars won’t be self-fixing, so mechanics will still be in business (in the short term, at least). The mechanic of the future will require be a combination of old-school mechanical ability plus the comfort level to work in a tech culture.Autonomous transportation specialistIf our future is one that includes self-driving cars, drones and boards that actually hover, cities and towns are going to need humans to monitor all this neo-transit. People will need to integrate these autonomous vehicles into current systems, and then monitor results, Austin says.Personal medical interpreterWith the advances made in genetic medicine, providers will increasingly be able to offer customized medicines and treatments to patients, Lebret says. Genetic counseling may evolve into genetic coaching. For example, futurist Madeline Ashby envisions super-specialized positions such as interpreter for a new gene-editing tool called CRISPR (clustered regularly-interspaced short palindromic repeats). Providers may evolve into individualized coaches or advocates who can inform patients about individualized medical treatments.Human-technology integration specialistThese people would teach others how to leverage and use the vast array of technologies to improve the quality of their lives, says Charles Grantham, of Awakening to Wholeness. This is basically an IT specialist times 10. This person could take a holistic approach that examines all the different work and consumer technologies a person uses and streamline devices and platforms to get the most out of them.Wholeness mentorWith a greater emphasis on mindfulness and “time poverty”—which Ford Motor Company’s in-house futurist Sheryl Connelly defines as the fact that connectivity has actually made us feel more busy—in an increasingly chaotic world, the wholeness mentor may well be needed. This person would help others develop lifelong strategies to match their personal purposes with a hobby that provides them with fulfillment of physical needs, a social network and spiritual happiness, Grantham says.End-of-life coachWith baby boomers approaching the end of their lives in the next 10 to 20 years, there’s likely to be a greater emphasis on how people want to spend their last days, Lebret says. An end-of-life coach can help individuals and families make better decisions on how to spend the last weeks and months of life. “Right now, there’s a lot of excessive treatment at the end of someone’s life,” Lebret says. “In the next few years, there will be a massive shift toward people wanting to add more life to their days, instead of days to their life.” These coaches will help people explore their personal values and medical options so they can create the kind of end of life they want.THANKS..!!","220,632 followers",Franklin Veaux,4K,47.3K,783M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-is-an-amazing-technology-that-people-think-doesnt-exist-but-it-does-or-is-under-development

It may be not much of a problem from the perspective of an average people. However, when we are talking about 500 kV to 1000 kV electricity, there is nothing too small.2, Laser technology.China is in the leading position of this field. The US spent 7 years to break through the export ban of KBBF (some kind of crystal). By the time the US has made their own KBBF, China already had better ones.This is one of the result of KBBF, laser weapon on type 99 tank. Within 5 km, it has 100% chance to blind opponent. Not just their observation equipment, but human eyes too. (Edit, if you had to stay behind the optical observation devices long enough, then yes. But the weapon itself targets only at vehicles.)3, Limb replantation.There was a case in China, which a person’s hand got shredded into more than 20 pieces. Chinese doctor didn’t just re-assembled the hand from pieces, and even kept most of its function.4, 12306.It’s the name of the booking website of China Railways. In 2018, it had a peak of 150 BILLION visits per day.Considering that it must be maintained 6 hours per day, from 11 pm to 6 am, in average it must be able to deal with 2,314,815 times of visit per second. If we also include the people’s schedules which most of us would purchase tickets within certain time period, the visit pressure would be even higher.All American IT giants turned down the request of China Railways of establishing a ticket system.This is the railway map of China. The main difficulty of building a ticket system for it is actually not the visiting times per day or second. That can be solved by deploying more servers. The real problem is that with 1 ticket being sold, all related routes must correspond with it.In online shopping systems, 1 item is called a SKU. If one purchase an item from Ebay, then the system counts 1 SKU less. However, take the G71 from Beijing to Shenzhen as an example: There are 17 stations and 3 different seat classes, and 408 SKU. If someone purchased a ticket for the full length, then the system would remove 136 SKU from the pool. However, if a tickets between any middle stations is sold, the calculation would get complicated. And this must happens within a very short period of time, since there are over 2 millions visit per day, any of them could be a request to purchase a ticket along this route.Plus, this change must be corresponded among all core hubs, and all terminal machines, including the ticket window, auto selling machine, agents, website, and cellphone APP to make sure not too many over booking.Last but not least, in reality, the situation could only be a million times more complicated than I described. 12306 is now selling 3 billion tickets a year, and is the largest online ticket system.
