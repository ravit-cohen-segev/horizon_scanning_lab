This is why copper is typically one of the first metals to come into use. Native copper is also typically found associated with deposits of copper ore, which appears in a range of eye-catching shades of green and blue.

It’s not clear exactly how early metallurgists made the jump from the association of copper and its associated ores to the development of copper smelting, but there are a couple of different plausible paths by which that could have happened. And from there, it’s not a big leap to experimenting with adding other components. It also appears that the earliest form of bronze, arsenic bronze, is a product of smelting copper ores with a naturally high arsenic component.Iron is harder to deal with. Ignoring very rare meteoric iron, iron almost always appears as ore rather than in a pure state, so it wouldn’t have been immediately obvious as a metal. Iron also requires higher temperatures to deal with. Copper ore is smelted (that is, the pure metal chemically separates from the ore) at 1100C. That’s also higher than copper’s melting point, so other smelted metal conveniently drip out of the ore. Iron doesn’t smelt until 1250C, which was a significantly harder temperature to attain in antiquity, and that’s still a few hundred degrees less than iron’s melting point, so the softened iron had to be pounded out of the slag. The development of copper-based metallurgy, which means bronze, was a natural step in the development of technologies which could eventually work with iron.",26 followers,Balaji Viswanathan,3.2K,5.6K,427.1M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Ancient-Indian-texts-mention-that-other-civilizations-came-to-India-to-learn-advanced-technology-specifically-the-field-of-medicine-Did-we-have-a-sophisticated-civilization-with-advanced-technology-thousands-of-years-ago

With over 6800 aircraft in question, the cost worked out to close $7 Billion dollars. Which made everyone involved stop and think.The Israelis were able to equip all of their airliners because of the smaller fleet size involved. Only about 40 aircraft were equipped in total from three participating airlines.The DoD pushed the aircraft manufacturers to adapting existing technology, like the Grumman Guardian Anti-Missile system.Saab also produces a protection system that has been installed on several airlines,The installation of such system has created some controversy, as both the US FAA and Swiss authorities question the potential fire hazard such system could create.The other drawback for such a system is that it creates drag which in turn costs fuel.","4,159 followers",Damien Leimbach,2.8K,1.4K,18.9M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Ancient-Indian-texts-mention-that-other-civilizations-came-to-India-to-learn-advanced-technology-specifically-the-field-of-medicine-Did-we-have-a-sophisticated-civilization-with-advanced-technology-thousands-of-years-ago

The Protector Unmanned Surface Vehicle is a unique piece of equipment which allows its operator to do more with less. A manned 9 or 11 m patrol boat needs a crew of around 6 men to operate sensors, navigate and man the weapons systems. They are also vulnerable to enemy fire as these boats generally are unprotected from small arms fire and a lot of space is wasted due to food, water and other equipment carried on board. The Protector changes all that as it needs just 2 operators who control the boat from a control station safely away from the hostile area. This increases operational endurance by more than 4 times when compared to a manned boat. It carries an electro-optical sensor, radar, a Typhoon stabilized remote weapons station which can be fitted with any machine gun or grenade launcher and the space wasted on the crew is here used to carry additional fuel and sensors.These boats are deployed around harbours to conduct surveillance, investigate and engage hostile small craft. They are especially useful in Anti-Piracy duties because its high speed of 50 kts (92 km/hr.) and a wide array of sensors help to track and chase pirate boats with greater efficiency than manned boats. Singapore has purchased the Protector and deployed them for surveillance, reconnaissance and force protection duties in the Persian Gulf. The 11 m variant can be fitted with Spike missiles and a water cannon for non-lethal engagements and firefighting. It has a twin diesel engine compared which increases its efficiency and speed. These boats will continue to be improved and a new generation of larger unmanned vessels will spawn from them.Delilah Cruse missileThis is a medium range, subsonic cruise missile of the IDF which is like a mini Tomahawk missile. It is exceptionally light and compact for a missile with a 250 km range. Its 187kg weight enables it to be launched from F-15/16 and even from the UH-60 Helicopters. The missile travels at a speed of Mach 0.3-0.7 and is accurate enough to be used to destroy enemy air defense sites with 1m error. This is due to the fact that the missile can loiter around its target and a remote navigator can use the IR and optical sensors to identify the target and strike it at the right time. Its 30 kg warhead limits its usage against smaller targets like SAM sites and moving vehicles. A ground-launched variant of this missile with the same 250 km range also exists. The lightweight nature, long range, and pinpoint accuracy make this a very dangerous weapon.ATMOS 2000 HowitzerThe Advanced Truck Mounted howitzer System (ATMOS) is the latest self-propelled artillery weapon which is going to be fielded by the IDF artillery corps. It is a 155 mm 52 caliber (52×155 mm barrel length) system which is mounted on a 6×6 truck which gives it excellent mobility. This advanced system has a crew of just 4 men which is possible due to the high degree of automation and the extensive use of computers. The exact firing solution can be calculated by a touchscreen computer and then the 4 men manually load the shell into the gun to fire it. It integrates data from aerial assets like UAVs in order to give precision support fire to troops. It carries 32 rounds of 155 mm shells on board and can fire them at the rate of 4-9 rounds per minute depending on necessity and crew reloading capacity. It is said that this system can be transported by the C-130 which can enable rapid deployment to hostile areas.Barak 8 SAMthis missile is the result of an indo-israeli joint venture to develop a next generation surface to air missile to equip their navy and air force. it is a medium range sam which is mainly designed for intercepting supersonic cruise missiles. it has a dual pulse rocket motor which ensures that the missile is traveling at mach 2+ even at its last stages. the active homing radar seeker eliminates the need for constant illumination from land/ship based radars and thereby allows for quicker reactions and makes jamming it very difficult.The naval variant is fired from an 8 cell vertical launch module and is normally used in conjunction with the mf-star radar. india has adopted this missile as the standard sam for all their warships from 2015. israel is refitting this missile on their existing warships. extended range variants of this missile exist. it uses an additional booster to increase the missile range from 70 to 120 km. this er missile will be used by the indian air force and in the future by the indian navy as well.EL/M-2084The ELM-2084 is an Israeli ground-based mobile 3D AESA multi-mission radar (MMR) family produced by ELTA, a subsidiary of Israel Aerospace Industries. The radar is capable of detecting and tracking both aircraft and ballistic targets and providing fire control guidance for missile interception or artillery air defense.My reply to people who think people who ask questions are idiots kindly don't answer with rude way and Rahul Sharma asked this question and if you cannot answer kindly don't answer because do nothing is better than your rude answer.","5,990 followers",Jens Böttiger,566,2.6K,17.6M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Ancient-Indian-texts-mention-that-other-civilizations-came-to-India-to-learn-advanced-technology-specifically-the-field-of-medicine-Did-we-have-a-sophisticated-civilization-with-advanced-technology-thousands-of-years-ago

The technology for both already exists, we just haven’t built them yet because it’s a multi-decade project with no short term benefits.We would begin construction of it by sending manned and robotic missions to Mercury, setting up automatic factories that would harvest its wealth of metals to construct 1km wide panels that would redirect light back towards Mercury. A large machine would collect that energy to fuel the station, it’s factories, and the growing number of machines dismantling the small planet.This process would continue, growing in speed exponentially as the greater energy income results in greater productivity, until Mercury is left as little more than dust and we have effectively endless energy to work with.From there, something akin to the giant panels would be used as a solar sail to receive the massive amount of energy and propel the spacecraft at relativistic speeds.Because we would have the entirety of Mercury to work with, building a large shuttle ship would be childsplay out in space. In fact, we could have many of them, all being propelled towards other solar systems with the very same tech to expand our empire and construct more Dyson Swarms.

We can’t go fast yet.We can’t be sure we can keep people alive yet, but we can try.And so that only leaves a Generation Ship option for a design (assuming this IS personed).The system must be well equipped, with on board life support sufficient for the 100s of years or more of travel, effectively near infinite in practice to have high chance of no issues! Could maybe do a mechanical partial or backup system, but would need a lot of stores if so (ie fly a comet).For Drive, get the biggest nuke power plant one could loft, 3x (redundancy), connect it up to the very best in class ion and other high ISP high velocity drive options, likely multiple, lots of redundancies needed. Plus ability to make all parts involved, on board!For life support, take all the lessons learned from Bio2, plus some hope, plus a shit load of back up mechanicals.For food, see life support, plus a crap load of dried backup food.Hollow out an asteroid, or use a comet? build an internal or external spinner for sufficient G’s to keep all healthy.And set forth!",4 followers,Dan Bradbury,4.2K,21.7K,235.6M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Which-airline-in-the-world-has-been-equipped-with-advanced-technology-that-can-protect-their-planes-from-missiles

I think since I may not be an expert in translating many technical details into English, I chose to enclose some videos/links that tells the tech involved.

23,"In a few areas, actually. First is infrastructure. The Chinese planned waaaaaaaaaay ahead while building. That’s why there were ghost cities. The developers built huge communities before they were needed, knowing that large factories were coming soon. Above that is public transportation.

The Chinese planned waaaaaaaaaay ahead while building. That’s why there were ghost cities. The developers built huge communities before they were needed, knowing that large factories were coming soon. Above that is public transportation. Smaller cities have buses available that will take you just about everywhere within the city and bigger cities have subways as well as buses. For going between cities and provinces, China has a high speed rail system in place that is more extensive than the American highway system! For example: I lived in a city called Nanjing in China - about 200 miles/300 km from Shanghai. I could take a high speed train from Nanjing to Shanghai in about 1.5 hours!In contrast, I took an Amtrak train from Detroit to Chicago (about 300 miles/480 km) and it took over 8 hours!Another area China wins at is public utilities. They provide electricity, water, and gas for billions of people for very affordable prices! I paid maybe a total of $20 (US) per month for all utility bills, whereas it cost me over $100 in America! Atop of that is wireless technology (which is considered a public utility in China). I paid 100 rmb ($15) monthly for 16 GB of 4G data, with 1000 texts and 500 minutes of ta...","68,787 followers",Kanthaswamy Balasubramaniam,898,17.3K,413.5M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Which-airline-in-the-world-has-been-equipped-with-advanced-technology-that-can-protect-their-planes-from-missiles
