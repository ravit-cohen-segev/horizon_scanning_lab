This redundancy stretches to their technology; vital systems are protected by multiple backups and redundancies, allowing for their ships to take horrendous battle damage and still be partially operational (and thus, to the Klingon mind, able to fight on).

They have shelves. Not because Klingons never use mattresses (we've seen that they do on several occasions) but because it's just accepted that a warrior aboard one of their starships will live a Spartan existence devoid of luxuries while there. One could imagine that this came about because the Klingons, who learned that hostile aliens with deadly starships existed at about the same time they were learning how to do crop rotation, have always seen their ships as weapons first and foremost. If you're designing something to fight in space rule one is to keep the total dry mass as low as possible to improve acceleration and maneuvering characteristics. And even if modern inertial dampeners and artificial gravity has solved those problems, if serving on a ship without any beds was good enough for your ancestors who gloriously fought under the banner of Kahless it's good enough for you, you millennial petaQ!And that's far from the only thing we've seen that's odd about Klingon ships either. We know, for example, that during the 23rd century they were willing to use dilithium crystals of lower quality in their warp drives than many other races to stretch their limited supply of dilithium between their large fleet. When you're building something as complex as a matter/antimatter reactor around a vital component that you know is likely going to be substandard, you need to build every other part to help compensate for its shortcomings. I'd imagine most Klingon reactors of that era were built with operating tolerances that were far larger than anything you'd find in a Federation ship, which also likely meant accepting a lower overall efficiency. And since most engineering work is iterating on previous designs, I'd wager that even after high quality dilithium became readily available they were still building them along roughly similar lines.

Sometimes, I made my own toys that I saw from books in the school library.Chicken was very expensive. But sometimes my mom bought a leg quarter for 9 of us to share. Eating rice with budu (anchovy sauce) was common, well sometimes with kicap (soy sauce). We weren’t allowed to eat instant noodle or any junk food.New dress was once a year, during Hari Raya, and it was only one for each person. We bought the cloth using our saved school allowance and my mom would tailor it for us. As for daily clothes, we sometimes received used shirts and pants from my aunts who lived in Perlis.At school.My daily allowance is 50 cents during elementary and RM 1.50 in middle school. I only spent if I’m really hungry besides there’s always RMT (rancangan makanan tambahan) given in the morning. In elementary school, I walked to school with my little brothers for 1.5 miles, and if we got lucky other kind parents will pick us up to school. Then in middle school, the bus ride costed 50 cents one way. Hence, on average, I still have 50 cents in my pocket which is not enough to buy food at the middle school canteen (they tend to charge higher price compared to elementary school). After some times, I asked to stay in the dormitory which was granted so my mom had to pay only RM 30 per month to the school. It did save a lot of money because those 30 ringgits covered all food expenses. (The students were allowed to go home every two weeks). At this time, we were all in school (2 in universities and 4 in high school and 2 in elementary school). So my mom needed to save more money. I never went to cram school (Tuition Center) to get higher results, but thank God, I did outperform others.After school and getting out of my kampong.I received scholarship after SPM to study either in Japan or in the U.S, I chose U.S. because I’m already familiar with English. Then, I continued my study till doctorate. I managed to get out of poverty and brought my mom out of our old place. My other siblings are doing good as well.I remember my mom saying, we might not have money but we must have knowledge to change ourselves.",41 followers,Michelle Young,2.6K,1.4K,5.9M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Why-did-China-make-their-own-CPUs-for-their-supercomputer
20,"Ha, a tricky question!Before I answer, let me ask another question. Are the USA, in particular Chicago, dangerous?The answer is: it depends on where you are.The same applies to Mexico and Brazil. Unlike Scandinavian countries, you need to know where you are going and at what time of the day you can go there. Taking the wrong turn in certain areas can be dangerous, even deadly. It's a different, more cautious lifestyle, where a low key behavior is quite important for your overall safety.On the other hand, I’ve always felt safe in Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico.

22,"It is a strange situation, since India is both the highest and the lowest of the four in technology.India is the only one with nuclear weapons, ICBMs, a sophisticated space program, an advanced pharmaceutical industry, and many big tech companies founded in India. India has over 1 million software engineers that are good enough to be internationally competitive. Over one third of the biggest US tech companies have a CEO that was born in India.

India has a total GDP greater than any of the other three, but a per capita GDP much lower than the other three.So India is the one at both extremes.",43 followers,Ren Hay,586,64,137.3K,2020,https://www.quora.com/Why-did-China-make-their-own-CPUs-for-their-supercomputer

Just about everything you can imagine.There's a lot of space, you can just sit where ever you want to and be on your own. Canteens are nice. Mess food isn't scary. Everything you need you can get inside campus. Even then, Bangalore is a nice place to be if you want to go out. Plus you can easily survive in luxury with your stipend.There's no end to studying, that's one of the first thing you'll learn here. And you wouldn't really wanna stop if you get the hang of it. That's something you'll eventually know. There's no end to possibilities.And it's not all work and no play. There's beauty in the campus, where ever you look at.

Instead of solely focusing on the grade you are given, focus on how you are being graded and how you can improve, even if you are already getting a high grade.Development of Your ThesisA thesis is the essence of your paper—the claim you are making, the point you are trying to prove. All the other paragraphs in your essay will revolve around this one central idea. Your thesis statement consists of the one or two sentences of your introduction that explain what your position on the topic at hand is. Teachers will evaluate all your other paragraphs on how well they relate to or support this statement.Strong FormA good essay presents thoughts in a logical order. The format should be easy to follow. The introduction should flow naturally to the body paragraphs, and the conclusion should tie everything together. The best way to do this is to lay out the outline of your paper before you begin. After you finish your essay, review the form to see if thoughts progress naturally. Ensure your paragraphs and sentences are in a logical order, the transitions are smooth so that the paragraphs are coherently connected, and that your body paragraphs relate to the thesis statement.StyleJust as your clothes express your personality, the style of your essay reveals your writing persona. You demonstrate your fluency by writing precise sentences that vary in form. A mature writer uses various types of sentences, idiomatic phrases, and demonstrates knowledge of genre-specific vocabulary, all the while ensuring the writing reflects your authentic voice.ConventionsConventions include spelling, punctuation, sentence structure, and grammar. Having lots of mistakes suggests carelessness and diminishes the credibility of your arguments. Furthermore, because most essays are written on computers these days, there is a lower tolerance for spelling mistakes, which can easily be avoided with spell-checking tools such asSupport and ReferencesFinally, your teacher will examine your resources. Select information from reliable websites, articles, and books. Use quotes and paraphrases to support your ideas, but be sure to credit your sources correctly. Also, always remember that copying five consecutive words or more from any source constitutes plagiarism. If you are concerned about unintentionally quoting your sources,The grades you get on your essays are important, but you can never improve your writing if they are the only things you consider. Focus on improving your essays’ overall structure—the thesis development, form, style, conventions, and support.
