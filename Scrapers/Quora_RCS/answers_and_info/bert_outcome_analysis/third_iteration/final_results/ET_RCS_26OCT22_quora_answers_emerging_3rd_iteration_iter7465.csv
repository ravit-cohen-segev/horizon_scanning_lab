Older people tend to be more conservative with their investments both because they have a larger nest egg that they are gambling with, and they will need the money much sooner.Investing in smaller cryptocurrencies (small-cap coins) refers to assets with a low market capitalization. These coins or tokens are not yet proven in the market, and that means it’s more dangerous to invest in them. However, it also means that there’s a much bigger potential to make a large amount of money on these particular markets.If you are looking to invest in small market cap assets then you are looking for a project with potential that is not yet realized. This is easier said than done, and you’ll need to wade through many, many startups that just aren’t that great before you find your gems.When investing in smaller cryptocurrencies or tokens, it’s important not to overextend yourself. Even a good startup with an excellent team can run into potentially devastating problems. For this reason, it’s important to diversify yourself to avoid big losses.","1,717 followers",Wilfred Edmund,927,65,881.3K,2019,https://www.quora.com/Should-I-invest-in-smaller-cryptocurrencies

This means that there is more potential for growth, but also more potential for loss. However, if you are careful and do your research, you can minimise the risk and maximise the potential for gain.Smaller cryptocurrencies tend to be less well-known and therefore less subject to regulation. This can be a good thing or a bad thing, depending on your perspective. On the one hand, it means that there is more potential for growth, as the currency is not yet fully mainstream. On the other hand, it also means that there is more potential for scams and fraud.","1,772 followers",Thomas Y Graham,945,55,4.5M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Should-I-invest-in-smaller-cryptocurrencies

However, it's still the largest and most popular cryptocurrency by a wide margin, and the long-term investment thesis is still intact.Specifically, Bitcoin's source code imposes a supply limit of 21 million tokens. Similar to gold and other finite assets, that quality makes Bitcoin valuable. Basic economic principles suggest that, when supply is held constant, rising demand leads to rising prices. And Bitcoin's popularity should keep it in high demand for the foreseeable future.Fidelity released a study in 2020 suggesting that 36% of institutional investors owned digital assets, with Bitcoin and Ethereum being the most popular holdings. Earlier this year, a follow-up study indicated that 52% of institutional investors owned digital assets, and Bitcoin and Ethereum still ranked first and second. More importantly, 71% of those surveyed said they planned to buy digital assets in the future, up from 59% last year.That trend bodes well for crypto investors, especially those holding Bitcoin and Ethereum. Going forward, as institutional adoption continues to rise and big money pours into the crypto market, Bitcoin's price should rise too. In fact, fund manager Cathie Wood believes that catalyst will eventually drive Bitcoin to $500,000, implying 920% upside from its current price.Now looks like a good time to buy this cryptocurrency.EthereumEthereum's price currently sits 15% below its all-time high, with a market value of $494 billion. However, it's still the largest decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem and the second-most-valuable cryptocurrency. And like Bitcoin, its long-term investment thesis is still intact. Specifically, DeFi products make it possible to lend, borrow, and earn interest on cryptocurrency without involving banks or other financial institutions. And by eliminating those third parties, DeFi products make the financial system more accessible and more efficient. In fact, Wood recently noted that DeFi is ""collapsing the cost of the infrastructure for financial services.""Why does that matter? With $165 billion invested in DeFi products, Ethereum is the most popular DeFi platform by a wide margin. For context, Binance Coin ranks second with just $17 billion invested in DeFi. Not surprisingly, Ethereum's edge has captured the attention of institutional investors. In fact, 20% already own Ethereum. And more importantly, DeFi is gaining popularity at a rapid pace.Over the past year, the total amount invested in DeFi products across any blockchain climbed from $17 billion to $253 billion -- that's a fourteenfold increase in a very short time period. And as that trend continues, Ethereum's popularity means it should command an outsized portion of the market. Of course, DeFi services aren't free. Investors pay transactions fees using the blockchain's native cryptocurrency. In other words, as DeFi products on the Ethereum blockchain see increased adoption, more users will have to buy the underlying cryptocurrency, driving its price higher. That's why Ethereum looks like a smart long-term investment.",0 followers,Glen Boston,704,71,1.7M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Should-I-invest-in-smaller-cryptocurrencies
