1,"Rapid Analytical Machines (RAMs). They were cryptanalysis systems that used statistical methods to help solve codes and cyphers. They mostly used optical coincidence techniques to narrow down the possibilities that a given message could be deciphered because it met a given statistical analysis pattern or had cribs. The messages that scored highest were the first sent to the bombes. This increased the chances that bombes would be able to find information about the codes and cyphers quickly. They were also favored for dud busting and long range studies of new cyphers and one-time cyphers. They hRapid Analytical Machines (RAMs).

They were also favored for dud busting and long range studies of new cyphers and one-time cyphers. They helped solve the German Officers one-time-pad code and were used on VENONA. But they really became important in solving stream cyphers like the German Fish cyphers. Colossus was a RAM.Originally patented in Germany in the 1920s by Emanuel Goldberg for rapid searching of keywords in microfilm rolls, they were first developed for cryptanalysis by Vannevar Bush in the 1930s for the US Navy. His Rapid Selector evolved into IC (Index of Coincidence) Machines and other RAMs, like HYPO, for the US Navy’s OP-20-G, which made them the fastest at breaking new cyphers in the later part of the war. Two IC Machines were sent to Britain after Alan Turing visited OP-20-G. The British developed their own Heath Robinson RAM which led to Colossus. Colossus is mostly remembered today as a precursor to electronic computers rather than as a RAM.After the war RAMs remained Top Secret. Several optical coincidence models were developed post war by Electronic Research Associates (ERA). The WWII ones used paper tape and ERA initially developed drum memory to replace the paper tape. IBM built Harvest as a fully electronic version using magnetic tape cartridges.The best source on the RAMs is Colin Burke’s",251 followers,Smith Jacobson,5.9K,1.2K,2.6M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-advanced-technology-was-used-at-WWII-that-is-still-unknown-for-a-normal-Joe-today

Today English is the unchallenged lingua franca of science, but this was not always the case.Back then the dominant language was not English, but in many areas of natural science it was German. The most extreme example among these is probably chemistry. If you studied chemistry at the beginning of 20th century, then you also had to study German. Period. You could forget English, completely forget it. There was no way around it. Either you started learning German, or no chemistry at all.If we compare, for example, Germany and the USA in the number of awarded science Nobel prizes, then we can see that it took the USA 20 years, mass immigration of specialists, a lost world war for Germany, a complete breakdown of the German scientific sector, the division of the country, a gigantic German brain drain to achieve 1965 parity with Germany.Or based on more general terms, the use of language. The combined Anglosphere (USA, UK, Ireland, India, Canada, Australia) against the Germanosphere (Germany, Austria, Switzerland).

For one thing, people generally do their best thinking from 9 to 11 AM, and that just isn’t possible on a round globe. It is best if people are doing hard thinking when they are at their best at the same time.Language problems are another problem. I have had problems getting ideas through to people who are second-generation immigrants, and who have never set foot in China, just because there are shades of meaning which are modified by culture. Add to that the fact that Chinese is a very ancient language, deeply subtle, and filled with subtexts and incredibly filled with word-play. Chinese have an expectation that English will be similar, and while the same structures are there, it is not in our culture to the same extent. Chinese is a road to wisdom, but from a manufacturing point of view, it’s a road with potholes. English is mainly a language of accretion and ruts. During the first article process, that has to be minimized.Now we come to tooling and the expertise with that tooling. You could, for example, use CNC equipment to build production parts, but for volume, you want heavy duty hydraulics and presses, and mills, and specialized heavy duty oily beasts of machines which take up an entire shop floor and need an experienced operator and experience mechanics to nurse that muthah, because you want aIn my experience, a CNC device is not happy until the operator is bald, obsessed, and drinking heavily. Because they are so versatile, they are also finicky and prone to causing operator expletives.We just have almost none of the happy, greasy, production tooling in America any longer. We shipped them all to China in 2008, and the Chinese are making those babies happy.There is another concept in manufacturing called The Great Wall. The origin of the phrase is probably derived from the Chinese Great Wall, but that connection is tenuous. The idea is that once a first article is produced, it gets thrown over a wall into Production, and they get to figure out how to use the tooling and people to best reliably produce gobs of those articles, on time and under budget.

They know when China does something, she is committed.For China’s foreign policy, there is another important element. China practices non-aligned foreign policy. That means China doesn’t form allies. The best you get with China is strategic partner. Forming allies means the enemy of your allies also becomes your enemy.China doesn’t form allies because it doesn’t seek enemies. That’s China’s stance on the international stage. She believes any international disputes should prioritize peaceful solutions. For fifty years China has not been involved in any wars because of this non- alliance policy.

US is starting to come to grips with this with “Make America Great” again, EU has no clue where it’s going.To sum up: Democracy for me means serving the people, and considering the economic growth and increased political power of China, there’s little doubt who has the superior governance system. Those that do not see this, will wake up one day and ask themselves “how could this happen”?",52 followers,David Levy,2.8K,295,1.9M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-advanced-technology-was-used-at-WWII-that-is-still-unknown-for-a-normal-Joe-today

Most men and women are trained in the arts of warfare from the time they are children, as Asgard gets attacked a lot. As a result, the occupation of just about everyone in Asgard is “ass-kicker”. There are barmaids, and a few farmers, but otherwise, everyone just kinda waits for the next invasion to happen.There are somewhat complex machines, like ray guns, but for the most part Asgardians rely on traditional weapons such as swords, maces, arrows, catapults and, of course, hammers.

Clarke famous statement:“Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.”And only in the Smallville TV show was kryptonian technology on that level. Where with technology they could do things that looked magical.The elements, the Crystal of Knowledge, the Fortress, were all examples of how kryptonian technology in this show reality, had achieved a level where it was indistinguishable from magic.Even Lara simply uses kryptonian technology to teleport to the Earth to see the home of the Kents. And see where her son was going to be raised.Kryptonians could even place copies of their consciousness into objects. Like Jor-El did to the ship that brought Kal to the Earth. Which then passed on to the Cave Wall. Which then passed on to the Crystal of Knowledge, and then obviously to the Fortress of Solitude.Even this fake Kara Zor-El was made from a human woman by Jor-El, and modified to possess all normal kryptonian powers and more.Jor-El was even able to send Clark consciousness back in time to save Lana Lang, which then led to the death of Jonathan Kent.Jor-El was even able to give kryptonian powers to any human, resurrect Clark, and implant new powers that would reveal themselves in time.Magic and technology to these kryptonians had no difference. We even saw how one of Lana ancestors and a witch, was able to use one of the element stones to work magical spells. And even put her soul in a stasis state which would allow her to possess Lana Lang in due time.But in comics there's a clear difference in terms of technological advancement from both species. Where Asgardians are clearly more advanced.One major drawback to kryptonian society that has been pointed out many times in the comics, is that they kinda stagnated themselves due to wars and other events. Also Kryptonians were a civilization only a few thousands of years old, while Asgardian civilization was millions of years old.Still that doesn't change the facts.And the fact is that Asgardians were more advanced technologically.",12 followers,Steven Carter,1.1K,3K,13M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-advanced-technology-was-used-at-WWII-that-is-still-unknown-for-a-normal-Joe-today

However can be used for just stab and kill too, their bio medical status remains unknown but it is shown that they don’t need any scanners or operative machineries to observe what’s wrong with a being ,And for their culture it is obvious that asgard is already in control of their population and they run on a monarch system .As you know kryptonians are vulnerable to magic which i think is that they cannot stand to science that they are not known ,.. so basically kryptonians are like higher level beings who have mastered computerization while asgardians have already passed that era generations ago",UNKNOWN,Un- Testified,521,294,1.9M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-advanced-technology-was-used-at-WWII-that-is-still-unknown-for-a-normal-Joe-today

I had diagnosed chronic depression, anxiety, insomnia, and I was perpetually miserable.But, for some reason, for some unbelievable reason, I was drawn to him that morning.I had to ask him what was wrong. If everything was okay. If he was well.I walked up to him, and said, “Bhaiya, what's wrong?”His eyes.There was something about them. They were eyes I'd seen before — eyes that'd look back at me every time I'd look in the mirror.Eyes that had no trace of hope in them. Eyes that only the broken and beaten carry.He just cried without a single word.I walked inside his auto and I sat down.I gave him some time. He needed me there but he just didn't want to trouble me.I waited for what felt like an eternity, and then he finally told me, “I don't want to live anymore. I'm going to kill myself today. You're the last person I'm talking to.”I said nothing but motioned for him to pass me the bottle of alcohol.Then I took a long drink, and told him to turn the auto to the liquor shop.Four hours — I was with him for four hours that day.I'd drink and he'd drink and he'd tell me about his life.He'd lived a miserable existence. His story makes me tear up even today, this moment, as I write this.The one person — the only person who could see past this lonely alcoholic auto driver that the world could see — to come to love him — recently died.His heart — was shredded to bits. There was nothing he had that he could live for. He'd made his decision.He was going to kill himself.Those four hours passed by in a second.I barely said a word.One bottle of rum after another was opened and we drank — then we got more — and drank more.Words came out of him — one after another — until his chest started to feel less and less heavy with each passing second.My friends walked by and saw me sit in a auto with a lowly auto-driver and drink and they gave me the same look the world gave him.I just didn't leave. I couldn't bring myself to.I was fixated on him — and I didn't know how — but I had to help him somehow.Four hours later, he wiped his tears and said, “Now I'm going to live for you. You saved my life.”That night as I went home drunk out of my mind after saying goodbye, I puked.Then I cried, drank the last of the alcohol I had, and then I puked again to pass out on the floor in a sea of tears and puke.I missed my exam the next morning.One year later, one lonely, miserable night I'd try to kill myself.My best friend would call him because she just didn't know what else to do. She was helpless and she couldn't trust my friends to see me like this.She called him, and he begged to talk to me and I said, “No, bhaiya. This is it. Goodbye.”Seconds passed....then minutes....and the bell rang and my best friend ran to the door because she was afraid to leave me alone.There he stood.Not many people know this, but that night he was there.Fighting with me. Crying with me. Begging me. Asking me to choose to live. He begged, literally begged.He told me, as I couldn't keep my eyes open, that I was the reason he was alive — he just couldn't let me do it.He'd not be able to live with himself.He had a huge part to play as to why I'm alive today.There's something I didn't know that night.When my best friend called him, he was having dinner.Just as soon as he heard that I was going to kill myself, he left his dinner, and he stole his father's auto keys since his had no fuel.His father saw him, and thinking he was going to drink again, he tried to snatch the keys away from him, for them to fight.Yes, they fought.Then, along the way, he'd drive so fast that he'd crash into the divider some distance away from my house.There was a huge dent in his auto that night.He risked his life — and he lived miles away from me.To give you an accurate example, he reached my home within nine minutes — a distance that is almost impossible to cover on any given night.That's how fast he drove.Then, he was here.At my door.To fight for me, with me.A lonely auto driver who I'd spent four hours with on the day he wanted to kill himself.What's the closest thing to magic that actually exists?Kindness — how it magically makes its way back to you.","20,147 followers",Aitijya Sarkar,8.8K,209,11.5M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-advanced-technology-was-used-at-WWII-that-is-still-unknown-for-a-normal-Joe-today
