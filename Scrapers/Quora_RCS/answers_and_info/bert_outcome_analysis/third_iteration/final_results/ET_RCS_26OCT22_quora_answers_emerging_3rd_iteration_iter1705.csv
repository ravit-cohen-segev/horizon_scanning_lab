1,"Nanotechnology, but in a really cool way.You remember the microbots in Big Hero 6, right? Well, unfortunately, those microbots are impossible, but there is a similar technology that’s being developed in real life.The idea is to build tiny replicators that can create more of themselves, like a sort of super bacteria that never stops replicating. Such a technology would be“…the first replicator assembles a copy in one thousand seconds, the two replicators then build two more in the next thousand seconds, the four build another four . . in less than two days, theyNanotechnology, but in a really cool way.You remember the microbots in Big Hero 6, right?

4,"These Startups are well know in China.ZhihuZhihu, meaning “do you know?”, is a Chinese question-and-answer website, where questions are created, answered and edited by a community of 65 million registered users, 18.5 million of which are active daily. Between its launch in 2010 and 2016, the site has had six million questions asked and 23 million answers posted. Zhihu attracts Chinese-language internet users seeking expert knowledge and insight into wide-ranging topics. At the start of 2017, the company was valued at £750 million after attracting investment from Capital Today, Tencent, Sogou,These Startups are well know in China.ZhihuZhihu, meaning “do you know?”, is a Chinese question-and-answer website, where questions are created, answered and edited by a community of 65 million registered users, 18.5 million of which are active daily.

At the start of 2017, the company was valued at £750 million after attracting investment from Capital Today, Tencent, Sogou, SAIF Partners, Qiming Venture Partners, and Sinovation Ventures.VIPKIDVIPKID’sTujiaTujia is China’s answer to Airbnb. Co-founded in 2011 by CTO Melissa Yang and CEO Luo Jun, it successfully harnesses China’s growing tourism industry, which has been propelled by rising disposable incomes and government support for the sector. The site lists 300,000 properties in 345 locations around China, tailored to Chinese travellers. Private homes include the amenities you would find in a hotel: all properties are expected to have regular cleaning services, luxury villas come with a butler, and customers can choose to rent other items, such as bicycles, during their stay. The short-term property rental firm is the country’s biggest, and is valued at more than £1.12 billion. The latest investment round raised £225 million from Chinese travel agentCambriconCambricon is developing a brain-inspired processor chip that simulates human nerve cells and synapses to conduct deep learning. The Beijing-based startup, founded in 2016, was valued at £750 million in August following a commitment by the Chinese Academy of Sciences of £1.05 million for R&D. If successful, the chip will be the first processor to conduct deep learning by simulating human nerves. What sets the chips apart from existing neural networks that require thousands of GPU-based accelerators, is a more efficient design that uses less power. In 2016, it released its first chip, 1A, designed for smartphones, security surveillance, unmanned aerial vehicles, wearables and autonomous driving vehicles. The company, founded by brothers Chen Yunji and Chen Tianshi, has six investors, which includes Chinese e-commerce giantNetEase Cloud MusicNetEase Cloud Music launched in 2013 as a music streaming service where users could create playlists of their favourite songs and videos. It then added a social media aspect that encouraged listeners to learn about the music and performers, and engage with friends. The Beijing-based startup, founded by William Lei Ding, has since grown to unicorn status – it’s now valued at £870 million, attracting investment from China International Capital Corporation, Hunan TV & Broadcast Intermediary and Shanghai Media Group. As of April 2017, NetEase has 400 million users who have created around 600,000 playlists.Meituan-DianpingMeituan-Dianping is a little-known startup (at least in the west) that is best described as a mashup between Yelp, Groupon and Uber Eats. The company, formed through a 2015 merger, is now the world’s fourth most valuable tech firm, coming in at £22 billion. Its platform delivers food, provides reviews, sells groceries, clothes and movie tickets, and has proved attractive to investors such as Tencent Holdings and Sequoia Capital, who contributed to its latest £3 billion funding round.NIOBeijing-basedXiaomiSince its first handset release in August 2011,SenseTimeSenseTimeMogujieMogujie has carved out a niche in the fashion e-commerce market by blending a social network with online shopping. Founded by Chen Qi in 2011, the app sells clothes, shoes, bags, accessories, make-up and beauty for young women, who interact by creating photo collages of the products they like. Hangzhou-based Mogujie targets young audiences in the western market and was officially launched in the US and Europe in 2015. Since then, the site has attracted 130 million users, with eight million active daily users. After its latest funding round, the company was valued at £1.27 billion.",356 followers,Gordon Miller,534,10K,165.5M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-upcoming-technology-in-software
