I know that students reach college not knowing who won the Civil War or where Alaska is.Finally, I don't trust any one answer, yes or no. I don't trust technology, yes or no. I'm continually struck by the crucial importance of the people at the top. If they're teaching with chalk on old blackboards, but their hearts and minds are sincerely engaged, the kids will do fine. But if you have some slick Progressive ideologues in a $10 million school with all the latest gadgets from Apple, nothing is going to happen.If you ask me why I'm so sure, I will tell youJust one final observation. I'm also continually struck by the use of sophistry throughout education. People throw up false arguments, maybe about technology, maybe about one-size-fits-all, maybe about creativity, maybe about not enough money, maybe about videogames, maybe about parents, maybe about the price of rice in China. The point is, if somebody wants to move you in a particular direction, they will devise arguments they think will impress you or weaken your conviction. Often it seems to me that the arguments aren't persuasive, they don't even seem to be serious. But that's one of the reasons our Education Establishment has motivation to dumb down both students and parents. These students and parents will not put up much resistance.(And out there in the real world, the political world, we see this nonsense every day. Even liberals must be struck by the fact that Trump could show up in black shoes and this could prove he's evil; and the next day he could show up in brown shoes and this could prove he's evil. There is a complete disconnect between the so-called argument and the so-called proof. Even editors of major newspapers seem incapable of intelligent thought. Our school system did not try to teach this, apparently. Almost 100 years ago H. L. Mencken said:‚ÄúThe most erroneous assumption is to the effect that the aim of public education is to fill the young of the species with knowledge and awaken their intelligence, and so make them fit to discharge the duties of citizenship in an enlightened and independent manner. Nothing could be further from the truth. The aim of public education is not to spread enlightenment at all; it is simply to reduce as many individuals as possible to the same safe level, to breed and train a standardized citizenry, to put down dissent and originality. That is its aim in the United States, whatever the pretensions of politicians, pedagogues and other such mountebanks, and that is its aim everywhere else.‚ÄùCan you disagree?

I wish desperately it were not.)","1,594 followers",Michael Van In,631,1.5K,2.9M,2019,https://www.quora.com/With-technology-and-advanced-technology-in-the-far-future-are-schools-and-teachers-going-to-be-necessary

The best estimate I could find (BBC Four) stated that there are 100 trillion ants on Earth and they have spread to every single continent on Earth. Ants are absolutely remarkable and these are some thing they have already done, without the intelligence boost this question gives them.Humans have build cities, and some intelligent animals may have cobbled together a makeshift shelter for safety, but ants have built massive colonies underground, safe from most hazards that lie above, with rooms dedicated to specific purposes like storage, mating, nurseries, farms and even garbage disposal areas like we have with landfills, all connected with tunnels that ensure good ventilation.A group of scientists unearthed an ant colony that covered over 50 square metres of space and was 8 metres deep. The colony must have moved 80 tonnes of soil to build it. This would be a New York City for the ants to build. But, we have discovered supercolonies, built by these ants, most notably the Argentine Ant. One supercolony in Europe spread across 6000 km, formed by multiple ant colonies joining and working together, with billions and billions of workers, basically forming their own countries. That‚Äôs not all. Argentine Ants from different supercolonies are sociable to other Argentine Ants from other parts of the world, essentially creating a mega-colony that has spread worldwide.Ants are also the only animals other than humans, to go to war with each other and other kinds like termites. The Army Ants of South America band together into a gigantic unit, moving as a united front and tearing through everything that cannot get away. When the Army Ants start to move, birds take off, insects flee, snakes go into the water or into their burrows, even jaguars and horses turn and run when they spot the ants.Army Ants can eat an entire horse. Compare a horse to yourself. There, you see why everything runs. Army Ants also build things with themselves. Have to cross from one tree to another? Have to cross a small stream? The Army Ants build bridges with their own bodies, ensuring no obstacle can stop their movements.Ants have also been spotted using deceptions. When two ants from different species meet in the wild, they either duke it out instantly or size each other up to see how dangerous that ant is. Ants have been seen standing on higher ground or pebbles to look bigger than their opponent. That‚Äôs not all. Ants use tactics in war too. They put the weakest and crippled ants at the front lines to suicidally charge and overwhelm the target before the larger soldiers come in to finish the target effortlessly. This prevents the valuable soldiers from being injured or killed unnecessarily. This brings me to another point. Ants act as a superorganism, not as one. They are absolutely ready to die for the colony‚Äôs survival, there is no retreat, just endless waves and waves until the ants destroy the enemy, meaning large colonies almost always destroy other insects or animals. Ant wars are pitted at massive scales, since both sides are suicidally ready to throw out millions upon millions of lives to ensure victory, like the Argentine-Fire Ant War in California, for control of not just a small area, but practically the entire state. This war has already lasted years and to my knowledge, is still ongoing.I have just given you an infodump on just how crazily similar ants are to humans and how they have thrived for longer than the dinosaurs and spread to all continents other than Antarctica. How they construct country-sized colonies and wage massive wars with tactics. How they work as one. Now, imagine they all gain intelligence. Imagine they all become as smart as humans. They would take longer to get to our standards than the apes, but they would easily become the largest threat to all the intelligent animals. The superorganism they act as ensures little room for error and no personal nature will get in the way. They could learn to construct, become deadlier, form armies to attack cities and wherever intelligent animals stay. I assume that the supercolonies could join as one, alliances between ant colonies that consist of trillions of ants could be formed and there would be no betrayal, just a ruthlessness and bravery never before seen. Ants will find ways to be resistant to pesticides and water attacks. All intelligent animals would immediately stop fighting themselves and realise just how dangerous the ants became.Then‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt know. Maybe World War Ants happens or something.Sources:Edit:The stretch of the 6000 km supercolony.

Guess what, the Romans in the medieval times were actually very good. The fact they lasted so long is testament to their resilience. They did not stop evolving either. The 15th century Romans would've run circles (literally) around Imperial legions in terms of ranged weapons and cavalry but probably would've had a hard time lasting long in melee combat with Imperial legions.Armies adapt to the enemies they were fighting and so as the Romans went east they had to adapt from fighting infantry based armies to cavalry and archer based armies. You can also see changes in the imperial legion in regards to how expansion and recruitment changed the composition of its armies.Late republic Roman empire legions were precursors to the imperial legions which used the same tactics in melee combat. The Roman legions became professional through almost constant warfare. Not many medieval armies had as many professionals trained as in the photo. Knights could be useful but if 90% of your army were just conscript levies that stood around with a spear and not much else, then they aren't going to have much of a chance against a whole army of professionals.These show that not every man in a medieval army was a head-to-toe plate-armored knight. Many weren't much better armored than ancient era legionaries, much less heavy infantry or heavy cavalry of the Byzantine empire.","5,360 followers",Valerio Cietto,677,2.4K,9.1M,2021,https://www.quora.com/With-technology-and-advanced-technology-in-the-far-future-are-schools-and-teachers-going-to-be-necessary
