But my whole team was. Everyone was from IIT. Who were not from IIT were pass out from IIM - Ahmedabad. 15ish member team. Here is the breakage :The point. IIT rank was a running gag. One would say he was a topper and then everyone would laugh and say who was not - that would be me - but I never felt excluded. The fun was - when people said -who is not a topper here? yep, everyone was. Meh. So we would point to the floor and the chair. Clearly the chair was not in the top.What did they learn? The real world. I distinctly recall - the God Medallist was not given to write any code - for 3 months - because - people found freshers coding skills — inadequate. Then he was given to write one dialog box. One. 2 controls. IIT topper, Gold Medallist.……….….That, produced 34 bugs. He actually cried. Yes. That happened. You are from IIT does not mean - you are smart enough — you are mostly - not. But things improved… he eventually will be hailed as awesome - and then would have 3 patents filed in a single year - BUT, later, much later. Later he would join as a director in McKinsey. That smart. But the fun is - 34 bugs…. for a single dialog box. That what Microsoft used to teach about quality and smartness.But you guys missed another huge firm. It is calledIn Microsoft you will learn - you have no idea what Software development means. In DESCO you will learn - you have no idea of anything in the world. And that is a great thing.Let me just show you how the resume looks like - see this guy there.Do you know how much they earn? One specimen at 24 earned 20 million dollars in 2 years - and went back to study again. So in DESCO, you interact with those people. People who are so smart that they can eat you alive and drive Lamborghinis. And you in turn understand - you are NOTHING - NOTHING at all even if you are an IITian or a rather dull topper.I personally felt it - and I think that is a great thing.IIT does not matter.

The ammunition bunkers at Tobruk were full of Italian ammunition. None the less, many raids were carried out on the Italian troops to gain more equipment. For example many of the captured Italian guns lacked sights, so the Australian troops raided the Italian lines, captured some of their artillery batteries, removed the sights and destroyed the guns (an Aussie ‘shopping trip’). Also the majority of anti-tank mines were obtained by digging up Italian and German mines by night. On one night alone they dug up 500 such mines and re-located them to form a barrier against an expected German attack.The Australians used second line troops, cooks, clerks etc, to form a ‘bush artillery’ unit. Although not trained gunners they became very proficient and critical in the defensive plan to separate the German infantry from the tanks, then allow the German tanks to roll over the Australian Infantry positions (for the tanks to be engaged in depth) before popping back up to engage and stop the following assaulting German infantry.Here’s a picture from 1941 of Australians using a captured Italian 75mm gun:and “rebadged” Italian tanks being used in defence of Tobruk by Australians",256 followers,Tom Kehoe,862,1.4K,18.9M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Why-do-big-companies-like-Google-Microsoft-Facebook-etc-takes-lots-of-students-from-IITs-in-spite-of-poor-world-ranking

Also, sometimes the cost of the product will be a factor but rarely is.Battle TestedThis might stir the pot but let’s not. The USA has been at war for the better part of the 21st century and one of the enemies whom we later defeated, was a rather menacing enemy in the world and the Middle East. America’s equipment has been put to the test. Going up against a well established military (Iraq) and militias (Afghanistan). In both conflicts, equipment performed tremendously well. The USA lost 2 planes in the entire conflict, one was lost due to friendly fire, and the other was shot down by a Surface to air missile while it was performing a “gun run” and was rather close to the ground. The M1A1/A2 Abrams tank has so far when in control ofVouchingIt really shouldn’t be any doubt in anyone’s minds that America’s Nimitz-Class and forth coming Ford-Class Aircraft carriers are the best in the world. Only 1 country outside the USA has nuclear powered carriers and that’s France with only 1 which is the R91 Charles de Gaulle. Also, they are the longest in the world and can carry almost double the amount of planes of the next carrier with around 95 planes. The US’s Seawolf-class submarines are among the most quietest in the world, with experts saying that a seawolf traveling at 25 knots underwater is quieter than an Akula III Class submarine tied up idling while in port. Along with the US 2 fully operational 5th generation stealth fighters that no other country has yet. The tech that other countries can’t procure vouches for the technology and weapons that allies can acquire. Also, foreign companies such as BAE systems, Bombadier, Airbus, and RAFAEL that work closely with American Arms manufacturers vouch for the work thus they continuously work with them and make a multitude of weapons and tech.RecognitionIf say Russia was more technologically advanced than the United States, why would they put their might on display with an aircraft carrier that belches black smoke and has to be followed by tow boats? Why would they set forth their best planes and not be able to land them on a carrier? Why would Russia put their best planes forward and have them shot down in combat against an unorganized militia? Why would russia put forth their best air defenses and shoot down civilian airliners and claim they thought they were enemy planes?

27,"The classification of Top Secret is so sensitive in nature and not preferably used by military authorities unless other lower classifications are duly excluded as possible uses, because unlawful or unauthorized disclosure of such ‘state secrets’ can cause more than just serious harm to national security, but perhaps even spark a war or military action by an opposition force trying to test the ‘proThe classification of Top Secret is so sensitive in nature and not preferably used by military authorities unless other lower classifications are duly excluded as possible uses, because unlawful or unauthorized disclosure of such ‘state secrets’ can cause more than just serious harm to national security, but perhaps even spark a war or military action by an opposition force trying to test the ‘product’ of classification if you will.Personnel whose duties require them to be involved in projects with very high classification take on significant security risks in a personal sense by just being involved in such classified projects. They have to be very vigilant in their conduct and handling their financial affairs and generally keep themselves offline basically as far as social media interaction goes even if their social media activity would be otherwise innocuous.Damage to America’s national security profile is very difficult to control once classified or extremely sensitive data or projects are compromised even in small ways.There are spies in various positions of access wherever highly desired classified projects are ongoing. Some of these people are actually wearing the uniform of the United States military service or Canadian Forces because some of them are actually in our ranks if you know what I mean.In the photograph you see from a 2008 naturalization ceremony, Lieutenant Edward Lin, looking like a young dashing and squared away naval officer he undoubtedly was in the peak of his shortened career in the U.S. Navy. Unfortunately for him he was found guilty by court-martial of spying for a foreign power namely China and sentenced to jail and other punishments. He speaks fluent Mandarin.Obtained information from U.S. Naval Institute News sources, found that he had been serving as a department head for the Hawaii-based Special Projects Patrol Squadron Two ‘Wizards’ (VPU-2) that flew signals intelligence aircraft based on variants of the EP3-E Aries II signals intelligence aircraft, two sources confirmed to USNI News. That kind of duty sounds very much technologically advanced and very highly classified to me. Somebody was not ‘minding the helm’ if you will when they hired him into that kind of highly classified duty. Suspicious were aroused no doubt only after much damage and compromise had come to light.The redacted charging documents from his court-martial state that Lieutenant Lin transported secret information out of the country without permission and then lied about his whereabouts when he returned to duty. The charging documents allege he successfully committed espionage twice and attempted espionage on three other occasions.Even after 20 years from ...",16 followers,Stephen Gandee,714,12K,4.1M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Why-do-big-companies-like-Google-Microsoft-Facebook-etc-takes-lots-of-students-from-IITs-in-spite-of-poor-world-ranking
28,"I has the Clearance and need-to-know for a lot of stuff when I was active duty. I then worked for a military electronics company and access to even more stuff. My Clearance was higher than the civilian Classified Material Control Officer in that company, so I was tasked to assume that position as well.Every day, by regulations, we closed the Secure Area. I did my walk-through, and found Classified documents exposed face-up on the desks, and safes unlocked and open. Any trained military type would never leave such docs face-up, even while using them.

We would reflexively turn them face-down after reading info we needed.While active duty, I received many copies of info I DID NOT WANT TO KNOW! Until I did need-to-know. I, by regulation, counted the pages with the transferring Classified Material Control Officer, and we logged the page counts together- on each piece. When I was transferred or discharged, in the Security Debrief, we did the same thing. I can still remember the page count on each of those documents.As part of the debrief, it was explained that I could not get a Passport or Visa to leave the US for 30 years. Does that mean that the info will be changed to UNCLASS by then?NO! And that was from 40 years ago.I see a lot of Quora answers that I wish were not posted; some of them are close to the real thing, but not totally accurate. Still, I would rather not see them. My expertise was in submarine detection and defense. I also had access to crypto code sheets, and sometimes maintained repair manuals for Classified Equipment.I sometimes answer Quora questions, but only when I KNOW the answer is in the public domain. As pointed out in other threads on Quora, a little bit of all these posts can be used to build a fair conclusion for some things. I steer very far away from any answer that would help someone put together enough odd threads to make a conclusion useful to a foreign power. Yes, especially those with Oriental names. I am sorry this is considered “profiling”.With the higher Clearances some of us had, we will never truly discuss details of our jobs with ANYBODY, including family members.I have lived in neighborhoods where there were houses across the street from mine that were “empty”, and there were never For Sale or For Rent signs.

29,"Just about any rank. Depends upon your job. I routinely handled Top Secret documents as a 1st Lt. In one squadron, one of my many jobs was ““Classified Materials Control Officer”. I had in my possession “Confidential”, Secret”, and “Top Secret” documents. 4 armored file cabinets worth.FYI: If I had handled just a fraction of those documents the way Hillary did, I would have spent the 2nd half of the 80’s and a better part of the 90s in a federal prison.","3,668 followers",Paul Rainn,823,1.6K,14.1M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Why-do-big-companies-like-Google-Microsoft-Facebook-etc-takes-lots-of-students-from-IITs-in-spite-of-poor-world-ranking
