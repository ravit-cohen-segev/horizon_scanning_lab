It was a little like a sci-fi movie when someone gets transported to the future - I would just wander about gazing at the technological marvels that surrounded me. Just to pick out some of the highlights:1) Domestic life - I was once visiting a friend’s house and their mother happened to be loading clothes into the washing machine.

I had the privilege of living there for 4 years in the 90s. It was a little like a sci-fi movie when someone gets transported to the future - I would just wander about gazing at the technological marvels that surrounded me. Just to pick out some of the highlights:1) Domestic life - I was once visiting a friend’s house and their mother happened to be loading clothes into the washing machine. She turned to me and said, “Do you have washing machines in Scotland?” Obviously, I was forced to admit, that no we didn’t. Instead we just went down to the river and bashed our clothes off rocks to clean them.2) Transport - I spent two weeks in the lovely town of Columbia. Missouri. There I amazed the locals with my insistence on using a strange outmoded form of transport known as “walking”. Locals would slow down as they passed in their modern cars, pointing and laughing. To them, it must have been like watching a live action version of the Flintstones.3) Voting – would you believe it, but in the UK we still vote by drawing a little X next to the candidate we want to vote for. No sign of the advanced electronic voting they have over in the states. Indeed, we are so old fashioned that we haven’t even outsourced our voting to the Russians yet!4) Guns – It may be hard for an American to believe but almost nobody in the UK owns their own guns. This means that if we have to rise up and overthrow our own government (currently seems like a good plan) then we will be armed with nothing more than some particularly well sharpened sarcasm.Still, perhaps one day we can hope to be as advanced as the US. And there is some hope, as we now have our very own version of Donald Trump as PM!4K",1 follower,Gordon Strathdee,4K,783,12.2M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-state-is-the-University-of-Advanced-Technology-in
1,"I suppose a question such as this allows a number of interpretations. If asked in terms of military equipment, then I am sure that we are not.However, in everyday life, consumer practices and the like, we are far ahead of the United States.I worked for a research and development company from 1997 to 2002, and travelled a great deal in Europe, North America, Asia, and sometimes Latin America.

You don’t have contactless credit cards everywhere, and still require signatures on a piece of paper on many transactions.Perhaps this is because wages are low, you can afford to have check out cashiers and bag-packers, not always seen in Europe or Canada. There you often scan your goods the moment you pick it off the shelf with your self-scanner and pay automatically as you leave the store. There are also many stores where all the items have RFD, radio frequency devices, automatically adding up your purchases.There are many cashless stores and businesses in Europe and Canada. There you can use contactless credit or debit cards only.Perhaps this doesn't count as technology, but your abject lack of proper functioning public transit systems outside a few very large cities is unbelievable.Even the smallest city in Canada has, at a minimum, a well-developed bus-system, often on dedicated roads to increase the speed of the buses.Then there are the many systems that we, civilians, don’t see or feel.My doctor and nursing friends told me about the many new high tech devices that they get to use here in Canada, many of which are not yet permitted in the USA. There seems to be a very heavy bureaucracy involved in medical approvals, one that is quicker and more flexible in Canada.But, in all fairness, again there are no real differences.In conclusion - just about all the European countries are far ahead of both of our countries. The smoothness of all dealings with technology is so much more pronounced in Europe. There is far more integration between systems.Smartphones are “smarter” and can do more… They have apps which are not even thought of in USA/Canada.How about the Swish payment system?The benefits of Swish for businesses in Sweden | Nordea… it is now under close evaluation in Canada … just wait.",UNKNOWN,Bill Yu Liao (廖彧),650,138,1.9M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-state-is-the-University-of-Advanced-Technology-in

In reality I can’t fault them for that because in my opinion the best way to learn any program from Microsoft Office to high end graphic and video software is from doing tutorials and getting your hands dirty. Do you really wanna pay tens of thousands of dollars for someone to give you those though? You can find them online for free or buy a book off of amazon that will teach you just as much, just as fast and just as effectively.So then it comes down to the degree and college credits that you’re getting. The degree might get you in the door with a company, but the credits are useless. I tried to transfer to NAU in Flagstaff as a Junior and UAT assured me that my credits were recognized and would transfer without a problem. Nope. Not even one. I would’ve had to start over as a Freshman. So I went back to UAT because I didn’t have much of a choice and finished up there.As for gaming the reality of the situation (at least from what I’ve seen) is that your portfolio and skills are far more important than any degree or anything else. If you have a degree from a University and you’re up against some other kid who barely graduated high school, but has an amazing portfolio and knows how to use all of the programs, you probably aren’t gonna get the job. Having that bachelor’s degree might help you move up the corporate ladder at some point, but I can’t even guarantee that.Personally I wish I never went to that school and would rather have my $50,000 back, but ultimately it’s up to you. If I were you I’d just focus on learning the programs like the back of my hand, developing a bad ass portfolio and if you do that then I don’t see why you’d have any problem getting your dream job without any over priced degree.","5,360 followers",Valerio Cietto,677,2.4K,9.1M,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-state-is-the-University-of-Advanced-Technology-in

The knowledge used to create the Imperium’s tech is long lost. The only reason the Ad Mech can build more of it is that they have plans printed from STCs which they follow without understanding. In fact, the manufacture and maintenance of this tech is now bound up in religious rituals, some parts of the ritual are essential steps in the process, some are just pointless nonsense, but the Ad Mech priests believe it’s all required.Even worse, culturally, the Imperium and Ad Mech are now suspicious of original scientific and technological research. They believe that humanity achieved technological perfection in the distant past, and the key to advancement is recovering this knowledge, not making new discoveries and advancements. They think original research will lead to heretical and ‘abominable’ technologies. So it is unlikely that they will ever recover the scientific and technical understanding required to advance their current tech.The T’au are a forward looking species that fully understand their own tech, so have none of these problems.Also, the T’au are much more willing to cooperate with other Xenos species and learn from them to accelerate their scientific and technical advancements, whereas in the xenophobic Imperium, even looking too closely at Xenos technology will bring the Inquisition to your door.Basically the T’au are advancing quickly by grimdark standards because they are acting in a way that real 21st century humans would consider normal.

But a common theme is how power grants one rule for leaders and another rule for followers. Leaders can and do get privelages and can get away with what would see followers executed.We've been told for years that the Mechanicus teaches its cult that everything that could be invented has been invented. Lying somewhere out in the galaxy, on a fully intact Standard Template Construct somewhere in the ruins of a past age is the full repository of human knowledge. But what ensures that Archmagi - the ones who created this rule in the first place - would confine themselves to archaeology, analysis and general maintenance? Part of the Imperium's stagnancy comes from how tech priests like to hoard STC fragments, hiding designs even from each other. They're so paranoid of losing power that I can see prominent magi having secret labs doing things that might well be… horrific. Knowledge is power in the Mechanicum, and your value is measured by what you can give that others can’t.We know the Mechanicus has tried something with the Emperor's science because there are rumours the Cursed Founding was not normal. Which may have involved tweaking with Gene-Seed. It may have involved Chaos because the inquisitor who joined a recovery mission reported back practically crapping their pants. So just what was the Imperium up to with the 21st Founding?What I like about Cawl is he's playing against the rules but he also might be indicative of his kind. He's like those cardinals who use their piety as a screen to hide their indulgences. He's got secret labs performing what could very well be tech-heresy but I'm not surprised because the dude's an Archmagos; he is extremely high up the pecking order. So high that the only ones who could call him out for heresy and get heard are either other Archmagi as or more important than him, the Archmagos Prime, or anyone between the two. Tech-heresy doesn't fall under the Inquisition's purview unless it involves Chaos or The Warp so it's up to other tech priests to call him out.Too low down however and the intrepid whistleblower might end up dead with no one the wiser.Cawl is breaking rules. But then again he might have been there when the rules were written. He's high up enough that very few in the Mechanicus can actually do anything to him and that's not beyond how we've seen the Imperium work.",162 followers,Andrei Matei,744,0,0,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-state-is-the-University-of-Advanced-Technology-in

The Emperor would be the ultimate boon to the Imperium. A peerless warrior, the most powerful pskyer to have existed and the ultimate symbol of power.That being said, He would likely never again take to the field of battle. He would sit upon the throne, dictate orders and confer with his son, Guilliman, to track down the possible remaining Primarchs and the finer details of the various campaigns and general running of the Imperium.It won't happen, his son(/sons, possibly, in future) will carry the day to day mantle whilst the Emperor protects the Imperium from dangers unseen and makes possible the actual survivability of it.",48 followers,Tomas Beautyman,543,75,451.1K,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-state-is-the-University-of-Advanced-Technology-in
