1,"Okay. Let’s assume a global pandemic, a human specific disease with a 100% mortality rate wiped out the human race entirely. Let’s also assume that by dominate, you mean develop human level intelligence and evolve to our level of civilization and technology, or at least to that of the late pre-industrial age.Some few million years in the future, provided some cosmic catastrophe has not rendered the planet lifeless, the most likely species to have taken our place would likely be one which evolved from a species of ape, or at least a primate with thumbs. Thumbs are very important. Don’t laugh. TOkay. Let’s assume a global pandemic, a human specific disease with a 100% mortality rate wiped out the human race entirely. Let’s also assume that by dominate, you mean develop human level intelligence and evolve to our level of civilization and technology, or at least to that of the late pre-industrial age.Some few million years in the future, provided some cosmic catastrophe has not rendered the planet lifeless, the most likely species to have taken our place would likely be one which evolved from a species of ape, or at least a primate with thumbs. Thumbs are very important. Don’t laugh. The ability to grasp and manipulate an object is what allowed us to make and use tools. If you don’t believe it, try using a knife and fork without using your thumbs.Chimpanzees and bonobos are closest to us genetically, but all great apes are remarkably intelligent. Perhaps the Chimps and their close cousins bonobos are the most social of the apes, but all could be considered tribal. Our hypothetical replacements will necessarily have to come from a species with a social instinct. Let’s choose the chimpanzee. (There is no reason to think that only one species could evolve to our level, however.)Chimpanzees have been observed in the wild to have a rudimentary language of sorts, with gestures and sounds which consistently mean specific things to all members of the social group to which they belong, and which vary from group to group - primitive tribal language. In fact, chimps who have learned some sign language have been known to communicate with each other and with other apes as well as with humans, and have been known to teach the signs they know to other chimps and offspring, even molding the other animal’s hands to demonstrate and help them learn the signs. Apes can learn to use tools, including hammers and wrenches, and wild chimps have been known to make and use primitive spears. Not only can they learn these things, but they can teach others to do it too. Chimps are omnivorous.Mostly because I love Koko the Gorilla, I’ll post a couple videos of her with her pets. She is a great ape, after all, and this will show that apes can develop the ability to domesticate animals. Another thing our replacements will need to have mastered.Search Koko on You Tube and you can get a great deal more insight into the life and intelligence of this amazing creature and her friends. That gorillas could climb the evolutionary ladder and repopulate the Earth is not impossible.But we have chosen chimps to replace us. They have a numerical advantage and are at least as intelligent. Like humans, chimps sometimes fight wars with other groups of their species, and in a coordinated manner. This, at first glance, does not seem to be a positive thing and for us it certainly is not - however, for primitive societies it ensures that the strongest and most intelligent - those most capable of advancing the species - are the ones who survive and pass along their genes to future generations.Over the eons, one group of tool using chimpanzees teach their offspring the arts of tool making, hunting and gathering, they discover ways to control and use fire, learn that when seeds are dropped, they sometimes sprout and grow into plants which produce the same food they were eating in the place the seeds were dropped and one chimp has the idea to save some seeds, mark and clear a small area and put them on the ground. Noticing the birds eating the seeds, she goes back with more and covers them with soil so the birds and small animals won’t get them. The plants come up and within weeks or months she sees mature plants bearing the same food from which the seeds came. Now she doesn’t have to go search through the forest to find food. Agriculture is born, and she rushes to show off her discovery to others, who follow her lead.While some of the group is off making tools, some hunting, others busy doing other things, some of them get the idea that if they offer a toolmaker food, perhaps he will offer them a tool. Trade is born, and spreads throughout the tribe.All this time, the primitive hoots and gestures have changed to include new sounds and gestures for each new concept. The language has gotten more and more complicated, and now there are sounds and gestures which express more thoughts and more complex sentences. These ‘words’ are taught to the young.At some point, perhaps idly scratching at the ground with a stick, a chimp notices a design left by his stick in the soil which reminds him of something. Excited, he pictures a tree in his mind and very deliberately scrawls out with a stick, the outline of a tree. He runs and gets a friend, brings him back and points at the design he drew in the dirt, then points to a tree and his friend picks up a stick and draws something else. Others notice, and so, both art and writing are born. Thousands of years later, descendants of that tribe have developed symbols for all the words they use, and a technique for applying pigment to rocks and tree bark. A written language is born and taught to the young. Knowledge can now be recorded and passed on to later generations, a history can be kept, and in the caves in which they have learned to find shelter, they record it on the wall.As the tribe grows in size, resources grow short and so a few move out beyond their original territory. New tribes are founded in this way, as the process repeats itself and the species begins to spread. Curious members of the tribe begin to wonder what lies there, toward the edge of the world, and they begin longer and longer walks exploring. Oddly, as they walk further and further toward the edge of the world, the edge of the world seems always just as far away. The explorers find fertile valleys, lush forests, and occasionally decayed ruins and artifacts left behind by humans (though they know nothing of humans and do not understand what they see). They see great rivers and follow them to the ocean. Water all the way to the edge of the world. Everywhere they travel, they see new and different things, and whenever they find a place that would make a good home, they go back and tell the tribe all about the wonders they see. Tempted by the promise of a better life, at times small groups leave their tribe and set out to find the next suitable place, where they settle and reproduce. At times, some natural disaster strikes and the people (for they are no longer just chimpanzees, they have become people) affected must flee their homes to find safety elsewhere. Wars with other tribes occur from time to time, but the species persists and continues to spread across what is, by now, mostly one great landmass, covered in dense forest and populated with a multitude of different species you and I would barely recognize, both predator and prey, living in perfect balance.These new people have long since run out of caves in which to find shelter and security. They had often found themselves in areas far away from the nearest mountain or opening in rock. At some point their ancestors began using tree branches to erect shelters, the insides of which gave them the comfort and shelter they remembered finding in the caves. Later on, their descendants started covering the tree branches with animal hides, then started piling stones up, forming walls, and at last they had returned to the caves (sort of).Along the way, the many languages, both spoken and written had evolved with this new kind of people, becoming more and more complex as they did. They had learned new techniques for recording their written languages and new mediums to record it on, Animal skins, if scraped and dried in the sun just right, could preserve their writings for long periods of time, and in this way more and more detailed knowledge had been passed on to future generations.Animal husbandry had begun with a small group capturing a pregnant prey animal and holding it captive until the calf was born, then watching as the calf nursed and grew. Other animals had been taken and kept alive, and it was found that they would breed in captivity, making meat available to the tribe even when hunting was poor. Someone had noticed that when certain male animals bred with certain females, the offspring carried certain traits, so selective breeding had been discovered. Elsewhere, someone had grown tired of searching for the nests of birds and decided to capture and keep the birds themselves. Instead of eating the birds - which had been what had made the nests so hard to find - she made nests for them herself and as they laid eggs, she had harvested them. She had decided to let some of the eggs hatch instead of going out and catching more birds. She too had noticed that certain pairings resulted in larger eggs or plumper birds (the birds reproduced so fast that before she knew it she had both plenty of eggs and birds to eat as well).The small settlements had grown and become villages. Some of the explorers had become simple travelers, going from village to village sharing news and knowledge. The travelers had noticed that some villages had plenty of some things and a shortage of others, while other villages had plenty of what was in short supply and and a need for things found in plenty elsewhere. Travelers had started carrying items between villages to barter with, and trade had become a part of this budding civilization.By now, from my long story, you see the direction I am headed and can finish the saga for yourselves. Chimpanzees become the new rulers of the world, domesticate animals as both a food source and as companions, form governments and establish laws, set moral standards, fight wars, study and practice medicine as well as other sciences (but, please, not nuclear physics) develop technology and a global network everyone on Earth can connect to with their computers.These new people do not look quite like us. They stand and walk upright much like we do, but they are built a bit different. They walk and run with a slightly different gait. The body language is different, as are the seemingly unconscious gestures. They are definitely not human, but they are eerily similar. They are most definitely people.One day, an especially thoughtful person sits down at his computer and opens a page to a social gathering site, where people often ask and answer questions and types the following question: If all the people on Earth disappeared overnight, which animal species would take over and become the dominant one?Note: I have not edited this post, as my computer will not let me. If I try to delete a word ad replace it, the entire page backspaces and when I type something else it overwrites what comes after. I scanned through it and I do see redundancies in the work. At the point where I realized it was going to become too lengthy, I started trying to make it a bit entertaining. I hope at least one of you finds it both thought provoking and entertaining.

Perhaps some will come down from the trees and skies and start roaming the Earth again, in a sense they have a head start over many animal species. Maybe some birds, like crows and a few others that kind of use tools would continue to evolve, expand their brains and redevelop their wings. Wings could shrink and re form into the hands they used to be, but to grasp they would have to evolve a thumb. Maybe they would use their feet like hands and retain their wings.How about rodents, especially raccoons. Raccoons pretty much have a regular hand, can stand on two legs and are pretty smart. As they evolved they could still hide from predators in holes and trees and eventually one might grab a stick or rock and smack or wack a fox or cat in the face, either killing it or scaring it off. Maybe it will toss a flint rock and see the spark when it hits another rock. Curiosity could drive it to keep doing that and if it lands near some dry grass…voila, FIRE.Assuming it doesn’t burn the forest down along with itself and family, generation after generation could finally produce Rocket Raccoon without the genetic manipulation. The same goes for rats too and there are a lot of rats out there so don’t count them out, even with so many feline, canine and reptilian predators.Of course we could look to apes as well, chimpanzees, orangutans, bonobos maybe gorillas. I kind of feel apes had their chance and we are it. Given the isolation and small populations of apes in the world they would have to first expand in population before they could begin to evolve like humans did. Birds already occupy every temperature zone and actually raccoons occupy temperature zones the same as humans and, additionally, live among human habitation with great success.I guess we’ll never know, because we’ll be gone.","220,607 followers",Franklin Veaux,10.4K,47.3K,782.8M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-would-be-the-next-dominant-species-on-Earth-if-humans-were-to-disappear-would-this-next-animal-adapt-to-use-our-technology-or-create-its-own

And we know there are other intelligent species here, and presumably there were other intelligent species before we evolved, but none of them went in the very specific direction we did.This, incidentally, is one of the reasons why I am doubtful about there being lots of other technologically advanced civilisations in the universe. Even if life is plentiful in the cosmos and even if intelligence is something which gets selected for in many different environments, it doesn’t follow that technological advancement is down the track.Intelligence is aIf we vanish, I doubt any species will seek to continue our work.

They got to that position by the being the fastest species to recover from the conditions that triggered that mass extinction, and filled up a world otherwise empty of creatures in their size range, living in their particular niche.As far as we know they were no more intelligent than a dumbish modern lizard, nor tool users in any way.Before the Lystrosaurs, we have to go back all the way to before 2 BILLION years before we find another candidate for “dominant species”, and it was these guys:TheAnd here we’re cheating a little because it is highly likely that they were not a single species, but a family of multiple species (they certainly are multiple species today). They were the first (and indeed, only) lifeform on earth to figure out oxygen-producing photosynthesis (modern plants photosynthesize by having symbionts that are descendants of cyanobacteria, now called chloroplasts). They became dominant because (we think) the oxygen they produced poisoned all the anaerobic prokaryotes that had lived on earth prior to them, in a hypothesized event known as the Oxygen Catastrophe.There is similarly no evidence that these fellas were intelligent or technological, though they do hold the distinction of being the first lifeform on earth to wreak ecological havoc on a global scale by water and air pollution, and completely change the global climate as a result of their activities.","105,668 followers",Dave Consiglio,699,6.8K,91.6M,2016,https://www.quora.com/What-would-be-the-next-dominant-species-on-Earth-if-humans-were-to-disappear-would-this-next-animal-adapt-to-use-our-technology-or-create-its-own

Either way, a hierarchy will be formed, and people/robots will undoubtedly be injured, maimed, or killed. And no matter how kind our robot leaders are, they will almost certainly eventually take the side of the robots - so, even if they try to keep the peace in the beginning, eventually they’ll decide that they can’t live with the humans if the humans keep destroying robots. This would mean tighter laws, and more severe punishments for crimes. Anyone who hurt or destroyed a robot would be sent to prison, and maybe executed. This would lead to the humans starting to hate their robot overlords, and planning a revolution/uprising. Unfortunately, since in either one of the economic scenarios, the economy would collapse, and many people would starve, the human population will decrease a ton - so the humans would be outnumbered. And once the robots realize that the humans are rebelling, the robots will wipe us out, and we’d go extinct.In scenario two, the humans would probably despise the robots at first, but not lash out (because the robots have such tight control that anyone who defects will be executed).

Is that not wrong? To make it worse, their science has removed many diseases and make it hard for other doctors to get business. Dammit you scientific people - destroyer of jobs!And the mother of all job killers in humanity was agriculture.A while ago, when we were exhibiting the Mitra robot at an event, a doctor walked up to me and broached on this subject.

Dammit you scientific people - destroyer of jobs!And the mother of all job killers in humanity was agriculture. General purpose AI and singularity would not even come near the “chaos” that agriculture created. Until 12000 years ago, ourThen these random dudes and dudettes come with their mastery of wild seeds. And before long, food production became a much easy thing. A single farmer in a few acres of land could produce more food than dozens of hunters attacking many square miles of forest. This gave rise to the “Instead of foraging and hunting, most people got involved in other things - like pottery, painting, urban planning, building homes & drainages, administration, mining, jewellery, accounting, medicine…A few thousand years later, another bunch of dudes would start harnessing the power of steam and create “nasty” things like locomotion. Rather than beating our horses to get to the next village, we would get to the other end of the continent reading newspapers. We moved around, explored things. Rather than using little children for many jobs such as chimney sweeping we kept finding better methods. Eventually the horse carriage workers and others moved on to other things.We often confuse general purpose AI with robotics.Let’s assume the worst case and we have a general purpose AI - that can do everything a human can. What would happen?It would be only as bad as agriculture - that destroyed most of what we did everyday. We could be doing things like sports. In most video games, bots are way better than humans. Does it mean we are less likely to play with other humans? In fact, we would play more with other humans just because the bots are better than us.We would do art, psychiatry and so many more human fields that we have not even created. Just like people could not imagine separate professions like art before the invention of agriculture, we have a problem with imagination.And we would spend more time with our children - who often grow alone with their TVs and more time with our parents - who often rot away alone.But, this is assuming there is a general purpose AI. Robotics is not the same as general purpose AI.Oh, what about movies like The Matrix and Terminator. Oh, you guys are now giving us Hollywood? If you believe in those weird movies, do you also believe in other dystopian movies like “I’m a legend”? In the latter movie, a germ gets out and wipes out most of humanity. Does it mean we have to close down the pharma and medicine industry?Hollywood can paint a dystopian picture from anything possible. They have even made something as harmless as vacuum cleaners into dangerous things. Should we stop doing all of them?In fact, anything useful can be made dangerous - think fire, water, air, cars, electricity, trains, medicines, petrol, sugar - any of them can kill you very easily.Anything that cannot kill you, is not of much use to you.Robotics, like any major revolution, can indeed cause chaos in the society. No different from agricultural revolution or industrial revolution. There will be displacement. People said the same for computing too. Could the people who were worried about computers doing spreadsheets in 1970s have thought about the whole new industries created by computing 40 years later?But, there are a whole set of important things that are not effectively today and we need robots there. Let me give you some examples of these:It need not always be life threatening. You walk into most stores now, and it hard to find anyone to assist you. The robots could walk with you, understand your requirements, help you shop and get things on your vehicle. It could play football with your children and take them off TV.I could give you 100s of such examples and that is the future. But, to get there we have to have more simpler robots doing more mundane things. A baby has to go through the toddler stage before becoming an adult.40 years ago, your parents would not have imagined what you do with computers. They could not have thought of the kind of revolutionary applications that we take for granted.A new revolution is beckoning us. Let’s grab it.","17,165 followers",Pascal Morimacil,4.4K,4.3K,34.7M,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-would-be-the-next-dominant-species-on-Earth-if-humans-were-to-disappear-would-this-next-animal-adapt-to-use-our-technology-or-create-its-own
