Hydrogen is fully 10^10 times more abundant by atoms in the universe than any combination of fission fuels (U233, U235, Pu239).3) When fusion fails to work, it tends to just flame out. When fusion fails, serious accidents and melt downs do not tend to happen4) Neutrons and gammas produced by fission reactors are hard to shield for small fusion reactor applications. Charged particles like protons produced from He3-He3 fusion are somewhat easier and more cost effective to shield. A combination of magnetic fields and electrostatic fields can be used to provide a low mass solution for biological shielding needed to provide excellent operator safety for mobile He3-He3 Inertial Confinement fusion reactors.Helium3-Helium3 fusionHe3 + He3-> He4 + 2 protons + 12.86 MeV (energy)He3-He3 fusion produces only charged protons and energy (no difficult to shield neutrons at all).Fusion-electric ICF Fusion engine -Charged Protons produced from He3-He3 fusion can be collected on light weight grids and screens and used to directly power electric motors that actually drive the wheels of a fusion-electric car or other small fusion application (fusion engine). Neutronless He3-He3 fusion does not require an expensive precision turbine-generator to convert nuclear heat into electricity (for He3-He3 fusion, lower cost and lighter weight direct collection of charged particles on grids suffices).The energy required from a fusion driver to successfully ignite small sub-gram DT ICF fusion capsules has been experimentally shown[1] to be about 20 MJ delivered to a 2mm spot in less than 3 nanoseconds. 20 MJ is the amount of energy released when burning 2.5 cups of automotive gasoline. The requirements of He3-He3 fuson are expected to be about 40X requirements for DT ICF fusion.Small fusion reactors with low shielding requirements powered by He3-He3 aneutronic fusion will probably arise at some point in our future. The style of fusion device most likely to support this style of fusion is Inertial Confinement Fusion.An Alternative Proposal Concept -In a current fission steam-turbine electrical generating plant, heat from a nuclear reactor is used to boil water, producing superheated steam. Basically, theConcept drawing of a 2-stage DT-DD pure fusion device that does not use nuclear fission to produce fusion ignition and minimizes use of radioactive Tritium while keeping the size of the fusion driver small and low cost.This opens the way to the application of hydroelectric generation of electricity, which is much cheaper than the expensive steam-turbine system. Still other systems using stored hydraulic energy are possible, such as a magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) generator driven by flowing liquid metal, which may possibly reduce the cost even more.FUSION WATER-PISTON ENGINE (details)Expansion ChamberSuppose a large, cylindrical chamber with a hole in the bottom wasSomething needs to be added to the above described engine in order toOne scheme that will accomplish both velocity sorting and energy storageHere it would be collected into storage chambers at whatever level it reached.Adding this element gives an engine that converts controlled bursts of ultra-clean fusion energy into stored hydraulic energy.More details of this Hydraulic Piston Fusion Power Generation System and to examine preliminary supporting engineering calculations and examine estimated costs please see -UCRL-JC-307068""A Novel Scheme for Making Cheap Electricity with Nuclear Energy""Joseph S.

My former father-in-law also worked at Lawrence Berkeley Labs, and was an engineer designing superconducting coil magnets and had decades of experience working with fusion researchers, even though his primary application was particle accelerators. From having many long conversations with these very intelligent and qualified people I realized that there are some really hard problems that block practical fusion, with no immediate solutions in sight.The only place we know of working, large-scale, energy-generating fusion reactions is at the center of a star, where the gravity of the massive star creates the necessary density, temperature, and time being held in that state at the core for fusion reactions to run continuously. This is called the Lawson criteria, and is hard to achieve. All of the layers of the star above that act as an energy exchanger, converting all the gamma rays and fast neutrons at the core into progressively less energetic wavelengths of light and motion of nuclei (heat) so by the time they reach the surface of the star, that energy is emitted as IR and visible light that heats and powers our planet's biosphere, and can provide photovoltaic energy to us as well. All of our efforts in fusion have been to try and reproduce this process on earth, in a small reactor that can provide practical energy.First I will talk aboutThe first problem with magnetic confinement is fundamental - no matter how strong or well formed the magnetic field containing the plasma is, it will always leak, as positive nuclei or ions spiralling around the magnetic field lines collide and scatter, eventually drifting out of the containment field. The only known solution is to make the reactor larger so the scattering ions take longer to travel to the plasma boundary, and thus more fusion can happen during that time. Pretty brute force.The world's most advanced magnetic confinement fusion power plant is ITER, which, to reduce the ion scattering problem mentioned above, is 6-stories tall and about the same dimension in diameter, containing the mass of 3 Eiffel towers, and it is still not expected to be large enough to contain a plasma long enough to sustain burning and produce continuous energy generation.A more practical problem is how do we extract the energy? Most of the energy in deuterium-tritium fusion reactions is released in fast, high-energy neutrons, which (because they are neutral, and have no electric charge) are not confined by the magnetic field, don't heat up the plasma, and have to be stopped by a thick shield, which then heats up, and can vaporize water to steam in order to power turbines and electrical generators. The problem is the constant bombardment by neutrons makes the shield material degrade with time, and become very radioactive, posing a problem for removal and disposal.Also, deuterium-tritium fusion reactions are currently used because they take place at the lowest energies and at the lowest plasma temperatures of all the possible fusion fuels, and thus are easier to ignite and keep lit. However, tritium is not found naturally in any significant quantities and needs to be manufactured in nuclear reactors. With today's production capacity, we just cannot make enough tritium to power even ITER continuously. We could use better fuels, like Helium-3 or Boron-11, which do not emit neutrons and thus 'burn clean', but the plasma temperature must be much higher and the confinement much better to ignite fusion and sustain it with these fuels. And while Boron-11 is plentiful, Helium-3 is so rare that scientists think that the best source of it is lunar regolith that has been irradiated for billions of years on the moon's surface. Any energy generation infrastructure that requires a regular supply of a moon-based fuel, even as energy dense as He3, will probably never work out.A proposed solution to the Tritium deficit is to construct the shield surrounding the reactor with lithium, which is abundant, and fissions into tritium when struck by neutrons, thereby 'breeding' tritium within the reactor itself. Of course, this comes with its own set of problems of how to capture, purify, and contain the tritium after it is released into the tokamak reaction chamber from the walls.Another issue is that when all of the superconducting magnets in ITER are running at full current (160,000 amps) to create the 13 Tesla toroidal magnetic field (13x that in an MRI machine) and to create the other plasma-shaping and heating fields, they are storing 60 GigaJoules, or around 12 Tons of TNT worth of energy. This is because the 180 kilometers of superconducting Niobium-Tin wires in all these massive magnet coils can carry enormous electrical current when supercooled with liquid helium.More info on the ITER magnets:But, if that cooling fails, the superconductor heats up, quenches, and becomes a normal conductor, and can no longer carry that enormous current. With 160,000 amps suddenly meeting resistance, the coil rapidly vaporizes, and causes a meltdown of the other coils, with a total energy release of 12 tons of TNT. This is very undesirable, especially when those coils are wrapped around a highly radioactive shield that also vaporizes and is expelled into the atmosphere. There are fault-detection systems, but it takes a while to dissipate that amount of energy safely, and there may not be enough time to react quickly enough in the event of a catastrophic magnet coil failure.So, some gotchas left to solve for practical fusion energy generation with magnetic confinement, with some perhaps not so easily solved.Inertial confinement fusionIt also has many of the same problems with energy conversion to electricity, and much worse wear and tear on the shielding from these small nuclear fusion explosions being set off, which also trashes all the precision equipment needed to hold the fuel pellet in the focus of the converging laser beams with extreme accuracy. So, a lot of practical damage control problems before inertial confinement fusion is a practical source of energy generation.While these problems may be solved, practical application is still a very long way off, and currently the main application of inertial confinement fusion is as an experimental testbed for calibrating computer codes used to simulate and design thermonuclear fusion weapons. As horrific as these weapons may be, the simulation codes developed for designing them (sorry maintaining them), are the one of the greatest tools for innovation in fusion energy. There is a hydrodynamics code which simulates the behavior of the fissile (and fusion) materials under extreme conditions of pressure and temperature, as well as transport codes that model neutron transport and scattering in the materials under these conditions, and many other bits and bobs. They are all standard numerical techniques, and the really classified part is the integration and calibration of all these codes with previous nuclear weapon tests from the past, and with these small scale simulations in the present.Electrostatic Confinement FusionBasically you need a vacuum container the size of a basketball and a pump to empty it. You put a small spherical wire cage the size of a golf ball in the center, and a larger wire cage the size of a bowling ball around it. You then pump out all the air, and apply a very large (10,000V) electrical potential between the two cages, with the small negative cathode at the center, and the positive anode at the periphery.Then you open a valve and let in a very small amount of Deuterium gas (commercially available) into the vacuum chamber, and it ionizes in the large voltage potential, the D+ ions in the periphery experience a very strong electric field (100K V/m), and are rapidly accelerated towards the center of the reactor, with enough energy to collide and fuse the deuterium nuclei (no tritium required). This fusion can be measured with an external neutron counter.Theoretically, power generation would be simple, as the fusion products consisting of highly energetic He3 and (few) H3 ions could be decelerated in an electric field and the current from that used to generate electricity directly.Here is ECG Herman‚Äôs excellent thesis paper on designing and constructing a Farnsworth Fusor:Although they seem like a obvious winners due to their simplicity and effectiveness, ECF reactors have several things limiting scaling:a) There is a limit to the deuterium gas density before performance degrades, so generation capacity is limited.b) Deuterium ions tend to collide with the wire cage cathode in the center, which absorbs them, heating the cage, and causing energy loss and contamination from metal atoms being dislodged.c) As the deuterium ions oscillate back and forth through the center, each time they change direction, they emit bremsstrahlung radiation, or photons of light, losing energy (this is how your dentist‚Äôs x-ray machine works).d) Scattering tends to reduce the nice, radial trajectories of the ions into a Maxwellian distribution over time, reducing the fusion that occurs.There has been work in using electromagnets at the periphery to try and hold a ball of electrons in the center, eliminating the need for a central cage‚Ä¶ akaThermonuclear WeaponsIn the Teller-Ulam, two-stage, thermonuclear weapon, a spherical plutonium fission primary (with deuterium-tritium fusion fuel at the core to boost it) is imploded by conventional explosives, the plutonium is crushed far beyond critical density, fissions and detonates. The initial radiation released is contained and focused onto the fusion secondary to implode it, ignite fusion, and detonate it. I just mention this to illustrate the enormous energy needed to really reach the Lawson criteria in a large scale, but nuclear weapons kind of freak me out, so I'm going to refer you to the link to the Wikipedia article about them if you want to read more:Thermonuclear weapon - WikipediaSo, in summary, we should not shut down or stop building today's fission nuclear reactors, as commercial fusion reactors are not only far in the future, but also produce radioactive waste (their shielding, which needs to be periodically replaced), and Tokamaks can melt down catastrophically and explode if there is a cooling failure in the magnet coils during full power operation. They also do not run on seawater, like some say. We need expensive and difficult to produce tritium (which is also radioactive) to ignite fusion at the temperatures and densities that today's tokamak magnetic fields can produce.To advance fusion energy in your career, I think the best fields to study would be physics (classical, electrodynamics, plasma, quantum, nuclear‚Ä¶) and computer science, with a focus on numerical simulation. The actual physical fusion reactors are so expensive and time-consuming to build, test, and operate, that you may only get to iterate designs once or twice in a career, but computer simulations can take us in so many different directions more cheaply and easily by comparison.Perhaps there is some exotic stellarator magnetic confinement design, or advanced Farnsworth electrostatic confinement design that has not been explored in depth, that will turn out to hold the key to fusion energy. Simulation is probably the best first step to find it, unless you have a few billion dollars and several hundred kilometers of Niobium-Tin wire and helium cooling tubing to play with.Brent","220,645 followers",Franklin Veaux,3.2K,47.3K,783.1M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Are-nuclear-fusion-powered-engines-possible

That‚Äôs what you get when you lump enough mass to make more than 300,000 Earths.We obviously do not have 300,000 spare Earths to play with, and it would not be very practical either. So we cannot use gravitational confinement. We are trying to use other means to confine the fusion fuel for sustained fusion.And we aren‚Äôt simply trying to mimic the Sun. We want to do better. After all, for a practical fusion power generating station, we want to be able to produce a lot more power, perhaps up to a few hundred megawatts of raw thermal power per cubic meter inside the reactor. So we are trying to best the Sun by a factor of a million, give or take.That is hard. That is, if I may use somewhat unprofessional language, damn hard.

This is like containing jello with rubberbands - no matter what we‚Äôve done, the plasma has leaked out too quickly. Even with massive, superconducting magnets cooled with liquid helium.The science is that we need to make it bigger. The bigger it is the longer it will take the plasma to leak out. No great leap needed here. The problem is that ITER, the experiment that is big enough that we expect to reach break even, is going to cost at least 22 billion dollars. It is expensive keeping the coldest place in the solar system (liquid helium temperature) just a few feet from the hottest - orders of magnitude hotter than the center of the Sun.And this is for a proof of principle experiment. ITER is not a working reactor. There are huge engineering problems left related to neutron economy and breeding enough tritium, heat removal, protecting equipment against 14.1 MeV neutrons, maintaining the vacuum at power conditions, tritium handling.I expect that when ITER succeeds that the scientists will step back and say ‚Äúno more research funding for Tokamaks - please keep your money - it is obvious that we were mistaken when we said that we could make an economically feasible Tokamak power plant.‚Äù YesWe should be spending the money on other fusion concepts, on more basic research.

5,"Fusion is the area where direct fusion to electrical energy conversion systems have been more thoroughly studied.Unlike nuclear fission where 98% of the energy released from fission is released as heat, fusion reactions release the majority of their energy in a wider variety of ways.Efficient conversion of fusion energy into electrical energy is more challenging and complex than in the case of converting fission nuclear energy where about 98% of energy released from nuclear fission is released as heat.In DT fusion, the fusion reaction most likely to first be harnessed to produce controlled relFusion is the area where direct fusion to electrical energy conversion systems have been more thoroughly studied.Unlike nuclear fission where 98% of the energy released from fission is released as heat, fusion reactions release the majority of their energy in a wider variety of ways.Efficient conversion of fusion energy into electrical energy is more challenging and complex than in the case of converting fission nuclear energy where about 98% of energy released from nuclear fission is released as heat.In DT fusion, the fusion reaction most likely to first be harnessed to produce controlled release of fusion energy, 80% of the energy released goes into 14MeV neutrons and only the remaining 20% of energy released as alpha particles which can be readily absorbed in some medium to become heat.D-D fusion of deuterium separated from sea water is not a fusion reaction that is considered to be practical in Magnetic Confinement Fusion devices intended to produce fusion with energy gain (more power from the fusion reactor than it takes to operate the fusion reactor). This is because D-D fusion reaction rates in MCF fusion devices we know how to build are too low to result in break-even energy with D-D fusion. The situation is different however with Inertial Confinement Fusion. Commercially significant D-D fusion in Inertial Confinement Fusion reactors using pure deuterium fuel separated from sea water is practical but energy conversion in this case is unfortunately somewhat complex, with about 66% of the energy release from D-D fusion being released as energetic neutrons.D-D Fusion of Deuterium fuel produces energy through four reactions:D + D -> He-3 + n + 3.268 MeVD + D -> T + p + 4.03 MeV(side chains)D + T -> He-4 + n + 17.588 MeVHe-3 + D -> He-4 + p + 18.34 MeVThe net effect of these four fusion reactions taken together is:6 D -> 2 He-4 + 2p + 2n + 43.243 MeVWhile 66% of the energy of D-D fusion is released in fusion neutrons, a significant amount of energy is also released in charged protons and alpha particles.Unlike the charged particles, the uncharged neutrons cannot be confined by a magnetic field, and for this reason cannot be easily used for a direct conversion into electric energy.Some first generation fusion power plant concepts have featured early power conversion designs that primarily use fusion heat to produce electricity and use the larger 80% fraction of fusion energy found in energetic neutrons to breed Tritium in a breeding blanket loaded with Lithium-6.It is possible to propose energy conversion systems for D-D fusion power plants that attempt to capture some of the energy released by D-D fusion fast neutrons and turn that energy into heat. For such a system, the neutrons have to be slowed down in some medium (like molten lithium), heating this medium to a temperature of less than 10^3K. The heat collected in the lithium blanket is then removed from this medium and is used to drive a turbine-generator. This conversion of nuclear into electric energy unfortunately has a Carnot efficiency of about 30%.Using a lithium blanket to capture a portion of the energy in fusion neutrons, which is 80% of the energy released from DT fusion and 66% of the energy released from D-D fusion , the energy conversion efficiency is low - no more than 24% over all. Further, liquid lithium metal is very flammable at temperature likely to exist in operating first generation fusion reactors. Use of hot molten lithium metal as a neutron absorber - coolant could compromise the intrinsic safety of first generation fusion reactors. We should be trying to engineer the safest commercial fusion reactors we know how to design. I believe it would be better to consider using a safer coolant such as molten salts in first generation fusion reactors. Molten salts cannot spontaneously burst into flame when coming into contact with air or water in a large accident while compromising overall fusion reactor safety.While this relatively low 24% conversion efficiency of fusion energy into electrical energy cannot be overcome in magnetic confinement reactors we currently know how to build,ICF fusion power plants (both DT and DD) can be accomplished higher energy conversion efficiency by surrounding the inertial confinement fusion target with a sufficiently thick layer of liquid hydrogen and a thin outer layer of boron, creating a hot plasma fire ball. The hydrogen layer must be chosen just thick and dense enough to be heated by the neutrons to 100,000 degrees K. The so generated, fully ionized, and rapidly expanding hydrogen fire ball can then drive a pulsed magnetohydrodynamic generator at an almost 100% Carnot efficiency [1].Electrostatic direct conversion -More advanced fusion reactions like p-B11 and He3-He3 that released a larger proportion of fusion energy as charged particles (protons and alpha particles) can use direct collection of charged particles working against magnetic or electrostatic field or directly collect particles on stationary screens to convert fusion energy charged particles into electrical energy at high efficiency[2].Electrostatic direct conversion uses a charged particles‚Äô motion to make a voltage. This voltage drives electricity in a wire. This becomes the electrical power. It is normally thought of in reverse. Ordinarily, a voltage puts a particle in motion. Direct conversion does the opposite. It uses a particle's motion to produce a voltage. It has been described as a linear accelerator running backwards. An early supporter of this method was Richard F. Post at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. He proposed a way to capture the kinetic energy of charged particles as they were exhausted from a fusion reactor and convert this into voltage, which would drive current in a wire. Dr. Post helped developed the theoretical underpinnings of direct conversion, which was later demonstrated by Dr. William Barr and Dr.Ralph Moir at LLNL. They demonstrated a 48 percent energy capture efficiency on the Tandem Mirror Experiment in 1981. In subsequent decades, the efficiency of converting the energy in charged particles as are produced in advanced fusion reactions into electricity was demonstrated at efficiencies as high as 80%, which is about twice as high an efficiency as the best current thermal power plant turbine generators can demonstrate while converting heat into electricity.[1] -","3,658 followers",Brent Oster,3.6K,357,1.8M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Are-nuclear-fusion-powered-engines-possible

Geothermal is driven by the heat still inside the Earth. Fission uses the energy already bound up in uranium atoms. Fusion would use the energy available by turning hydrogen into helium. And we have LOTS and LOTS of hydrogen, we can get it from water as needed.",341 followers,Payam Adlparvar,820,530,2.5M,2017,https://www.quora.com/Are-nuclear-fusion-powered-engines-possible

This takes a finite amount of time. The absorption reaction is energy dependent, and so, not all absorptions cause fission. Before all possible fission reactions have occurred, the bomb blows itself apart, and fissioning and energy release ceases. Fission bombs are limited to ~800 kilotons of TNT yield.Fusion reactions do not depend on neutron absorption, but rather merely on energy density. Fusion bombs use a fission bomb as the trigger to reach the energy density that causes fusion. The intense energy released by fission causes a rapid rise in temperature and pressure, which simultaneously affects all of the fusion fuel. Fusion elements are small, and a relatively huge number of them can be packed into a small space, as compared to fission fuel elements. A much higher fraction of fuel reactions can occur in a fusion bomb before it blows itself apart.Russia once detonated a fusion bomb‚Ä¶ the Tsar Bomb‚Ä¶ that yielded 50‚Äì60 Megatons. The bomb was originally designed to yield 100 Mton, but was scaled back. Theoretically, there is no upper limit to the yield of a fusion bomb. So long as there is fuel available and the conditions to cause fusion the conditions are self-propagating.Fission reactors are less attractive than fusion reactors for several reasons not having to do with the amounts of power they can produce. First, and foremost, fission reactors produce long-lived radioisotopes that must be dealt with. The spent fuel of uranium reactors contains Pu239, an excellent fissile material for bomb-making which must be guarded lest it fall into the hands of terrorists. Fission reactors utilize a ‚Äúcoolant‚Äù to transfer heat from the core. Leaks of high-temperature coolant can be disastrous. In the case of water coolant, steam explosions are possible. Fissioning fuel creates radioactive fission fragments, which continue to release significant amounts of energy by radioactive decay even after fissioning stops. This ‚Äúdecay heat‚Äù lasts for several minutes after the reactor is shut down and, in cases where core cooling is lost, can lead to melting fuel and the release of extremely hazardous radioisotopes.The easiest to produce fusion reaction of deuterium and tritium creates only relatively short half-life radioisotopes in structural materials (by neutron activation). Although tritium release is potential, tritium is not highly hazardous. It is easily dispersed in air, emits a weak 15 kev beta, and cycles out of the human body (as water) with a biological half-life of 7‚Äì14 days. When the fusion reaction stops, all power production stops‚Ä¶ no ‚Äúdecay heat"". Energy from deuterium-tritium reactors is transferred by neutron absorption in a liquified lithium ‚Äúblanket‚Äù (‚Äúprimary coolant‚Äù) which, in order to power an electric power producing turbine, must boil water. But, the potential for a ‚Äústeam explosion‚Äù is not the same as that posed by the large volume of water as a primary coolant for typical fission reactors.A rare ‚Äúquenching event‚Äù make take place in the superconducting coils of a plasma confinement fusion reactor. A quench happens when the superconductivity of the electromagnet coils is compromised. This sets up a cascade of ‚Äúde-superconding‚Äù conditions resulting in a rapid rise of electrical resistance. When trillions of amps in a superconducting circuit suddenly meet high resistance, the power generated can be explosive. Of course, researchers are fabricating ways to minimize the effects of the onset of a quench.",826 followers,George Dowson,4K,527,3.7M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Are-nuclear-fusion-powered-engines-possible

And that is sufficient to make a piddly amount of heat per cubic metre. Scaled down to operations that would fit on Earth, that‚Äôs not going to cut it for power generation. You‚Äôd get more power out of a single large solar panel in good conditions. (That might seem odd but consider the sheer size of the sun, even ‚Äújust‚Äù the core region).What‚Äôs more, we can‚Äôt achieve those sorts of pressures so we need much higher temperatures before we even start fusion; closer to 100 million degrees. We then need to surround this heating zone with the kind of insulation a few hundred thousand miles worth of mind-bogglingly dense gas and plasma provides (using superpowered magnets), andI hope this gives you an idea of what an achievement creating a working fusion power plant will be. It should be considered like the Manhattan project or Apollo programme but way,It should be awe inspiring, and I hope I‚Äôve conveyed a little of that awe.Here‚Äôs a photo of the pit in which they‚Äôre building the core at ITER.

The pressure vessel (the first section of which is complete and slowly making its way into this pit) will contain more steel than the Eiffel tower. Once running, the core will be the hottest place in the solar system, in fact it‚Äôll be hotter than anywhere within around 100 light years of Earth as only blue supergiant stars get this hot at their cores.And ITER is just the small scale prototype.

The fusion core emits a large number of fast neutrons, and these neutrons are capable of causing fission in ordinary U-238. So the fusion core in such a bomb is surrounded by U-238, and the induced fission gives about half of the energy. It also gives almost all of the fallout. So in the neutron bomb, this layer is omitted, resulting in much less fallout. The emitted neutrons, which can kill anyone nearby, give the neutron bomb its name.If you are still concerned about what MeV means, it is a unit of energy that is very useful for nuclear reactions.

China may be building one currently. India is also developing Thorium reactors. Thorium being potentially a far better fuel than Uranium. MSR problems include testing of materials and equipment, assessing long term operation and management of the MSR fuel mix with chemical management of nuclear materials produced. Of line removal of useful products and reactor poisons that reduce available neutrons.I think we urgently need more low carbon energy and Thorium could produce results faster than anything else. And more complex and difficult reactor types Should be produced in future. That requires rapid production of MSR prototypes. Thorium being highly efficient readily available and cheap. Able to power the Earth for hundreds of years. While better reactors are produced.Fast Breeder reactors including molten metal and gas coolant. Past development of these reactor types has been difficult. Especially molten metals including Sodium. Sodium is highly flammable when in contact with oxygen. The advantages of fast breeder reactors are that they can convert waste material into fissile material. Especially turning depleted Uranium into fuel grade material by colliding fast neutrons with depleted Uranium nuclei. Gas breeders include helium coolants. Major [problem may be a lack of Helium available.Molten Salt and Fusion Reactors. Molten Salt may be a coolant for fusion reactors and also absorption of excess neutrons that can badly damage reactor materials. The molten salt could also be used to carry fissile material that could be fissioned by the neutrons. This can release energy or could be used to burn up nuclear waste. Or fast neutrons can create fissile material from depleted Uranium.If we could easily produce neutrons we could build a subcritical reactor. A reactor that could be turned of by stopping the Neutrons. It means it could be turned off instantly without risks of meltdown. Also for burning up nuclear waste. A powerful supply of neutrons could be from a fusion reactor.\\ITER FUSION REACTORFUSION REACTORA number of conventional donut type tokamak reactors are operating as prototypes but none are functional. Some of these Tokamak type reactors have produced longer running times. Recently a German reactor worked for 100 seconds.More unconventional fusion reactors are being developed. This includes a small Lockheed Martin reactor. It is said to be very close to being operational. Small being that it could be towed by a large truck. A couple of designs could be much smaller. A very large design could combine very large pistons to compress molten mercury with fusible material. The large scale version is very impressive. Another reactor produces plasma that is concentrated enough to fuse atoms.Molten salt fission reactors are potential highly efficient and able to burn up all the fuel and its fissile products. Using Thorium no enrichment is needed. Thorium is a buy product of rare Earth mining so could be extremely cheap. Currently it is mostly regarded as waste. Despite very, very low radiation much of it is regarded as nuclear material which is difficult to dispose.One joint project between China and the US is a fission travelling wave reactor. This travelling wave in some ways seems like a nuclear candle but that is not a scientific description. This reactor is a very safe and simple reactor using depleted Uranium as fuel. Depleted Uranium is available in huge amounts and regarded as nuclear waste. It is the waste produced when the very small amounts of useful fuel grade Uranium is separated by expensive enrichment. When mined less than 10% of Uranium is fuel grade. So over 95% becomes the depleted Uranium. The main use of depleted Uranium is military, for armour or armour piercing material. As in the M1 Abrams. This reactor type can also use molten salt to cool and transfer heat. But not carry the fuel. It is almost completely self regulating. It can be transported easily. In effect acting like a nuclear battery. This is a project of Bill Gates who wants safe, cheap and easy to run reactor that could be used in Africa where no nuclear industry is available. It would not need complex chemical management of the coolant containing fuel as in an MSR.I think MSR prototypes sho7uld be produces rapidly to prove MSR is closer to being completed and has less risks. But huge amounts of money is going into fusion and breeder reactors. I would like to some diverted to produce MSR prototypes.The international ITER project is not complete. But its huge size and use of advanced and expensive materials make it potentially much more efficient and powerful. More powerful than any other fusion reactor. It uses huge and powerful superconducting magnets to pressurise the fuel. Potentially 8 times more pressure and heat.","105,674 followers",Dave Consiglio,4.5K,6.8K,91.6M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Are-nuclear-fusion-powered-engines-possible
