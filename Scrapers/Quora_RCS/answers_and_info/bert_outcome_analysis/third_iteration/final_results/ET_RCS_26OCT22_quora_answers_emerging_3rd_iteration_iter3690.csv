People know about the Great Wall, but how many know about the great temples of southern India?This is partly due to the lackluster historical records that ancient Indians kept and also partly because modern Indians have a tendency to look down upon their ancient heritage and view western ideas and ideals as superior. China also has this problem but not nearly to the same extent.Ancient India was a hub of culture and technology and the absolute capital of world spirituality.

The Iron Pillar of DelhiThe Iron Pillar is famous for the rust-resistant composition of the metals used in its construction and has been standing tall for some past 1600 years.The pillar has attracted the attention of archaeologist and materials scientist because of its high resistance to corrosion and has been called a testimony to the high level of skill achieved by the ancient Indian iron smiths in the extraction and processing of iron.2. SanskritAccording to research, Sanskrit is one of the most suitable languages for the computers. It is considered to be very efficient in making algorithms. In a report given by a NASA scientist, it is said that the USA is creating the 6th and 7th generation Super Computers based on the Sanskrit language.According to NASA, Sanskrit is the only unambiguous language in the world meaning it is the only language that is not open to more than one interpretation of something.Now no one could have created such a logically accurate and intelligent language accidentally and this definitely would have been a work of some intelligent person(s).3. Time TravelIn Hindu mythology, the Mahabharata mentions the story of King Raivata and Kakudmi, who travels to heaven to meet the creator Brahma and is surprised to learn when he returns to Earth that many ages have passed.Although the idea of time travel hitting someone's mind maybe considered as a sheer coincidence but even a slight thought of time relativity striking in someone's head can't be ignored and it forces me believe that our ancestors do had the knowledge of time travel and may even had done one.4. The Great Pyramid of GizaThe level of skills and technology of the people of Egypt was such that even if we tried to build an exact replica of this pyramid it would not be possible. We do not have the precise technology that the ancient Egyptians had that was necessary to build this pyramid.and now some mythological facts…5. Head transplant of GaneshaIt is said that once there was a battle between Ganesha and Shiva for Goddess Parvati and in the process Shiva beheaded Ganesh.After learning who Ganesha really was, Shiva decided to bring him back to life and told his entourage to bring the head of the first sleeping being they found with it’s head facing towards the North. Well, the first thing they found was an elephant, so Shiva attached the elephant head to Ganesh’s body.Which signifies that very complex surgeries like that of head transplant was possible with the technology of that time.6. Predictions of MahabharataThere are several predictions made in the epic of Mahabharata about today's world which are more or less accurate and clearly describes today's society which speaks volumes for the astrology of the past.7. Flying chariot in RamayanaThe flying chariot as described in Ramayana:""8. Adam's BridgeRamayana describes the construction of a bridge from India to Sri Lanka (1.2 million years ago).The fabled bridge that was constructed by an ape race on the orders of Lord Rama, in the Treta yuga, which according to Indian time or yuga cycles, happened 1.2 million years ago, was discovered by a NASA space satellite. It has been dated 1.2 million years, thus putting it in the time-frame of it’s so-called construction. The bridge, called Adams bridge, a 30km long chain of shoals has been characterized to have a man-made structure.Based on these mythological facts some would feel it's all talking in air, but I do believe these so called gods might have existed long time back on our earth and could have been possibly belonged to some higher races who had more advanced skills and technology then we haveShivaRavanaDurgaBrahmaCheers!!!",719 followers,Sandip Bhatnagar,629,321,1.4M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Are-there-any-stories-that-meld-magical-realism-with-science-fiction-through-Clarke-s-third-law-i-e-said-magic-involved-is-really-advanced-technology

However, Rutherford did observe protons deflecting at extreme angles, and so proposed that electrons orbit the nucleus rather than being embedded in a mass of positive charge.To tackle the moon problem, all you need is a bit of geometry. If you hold your thumb up at arm’s length away, your thumb takes up about one arc-degree of the sky. Three fingers side by side at arm’s length is about five arc degrees. Using these rudimentary measurements you can obtain the angular diameter of the moon, which can be used to calculate it’s distance.","5,990 followers",Jens Böttiger,566,2.6K,17.6M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-happened-to-the-ancient-super-advanced-technology-of-ancient-India-Is-there-a-way-to-get-it-back-Are-there-still-sources-which-have-info-on-these-technologies
