0,"One thing to understand is that the scale for change across the two things you're talking about are wildly different. Human evolution is something that occurs extremely slowly (relatively to us), taking place over tens or hundreds of thousands of years.On the flip side, technology growth expands at an exponential rate. Change accellerates change. For example, consider the difference between the phone you hold in your hand and your desktop computer. Ten years ago, the processing power in your phone was on your desktop, in ten years, your phone will be able to do what your desktop does now. SomeOne thing to understand is that the scale for change across the two things you're talking about are wildly different. Human evolution is something that occurs extremely slowly (relatively to us), taking place over tens or hundreds of thousands of years.On the flip side, technology growth expands at an exponential rate. Change accellerates change. For example, consider the difference between the phone you hold in your hand and your desktop computer. Ten years ago, the processing power in your phone was on your desktop, in ten years, your phone will be able to do what your desktop does now. Some technologists agree that this is a phenomenon that will continue.Depending on who you ask, we are on the precipice of an explosion of technology. Eventually the compounding exponential growth builds so much that we cover as much scientific ground in a day than we used to cover in a century. Technical application is just a few steps behind the discovery. Just last year it was announced that YouTube has more content available on it than humans had produced in their entire history.If anything, if this continues, humans will continue to be forced to adapt quickly to a world that changes on a pace akin to our technology and not to the evolution of the species.For example, in my short time on the planet, just to communicate with fellow homo sapiens, I've had to become accustomed to first a rotary phone, then a touch-tone phone, then dial-up modems, then a mobile phone, and now facebook. (Next time you chat with someone from the WWII generation and they are crotchety, just think about how much technological change they've had to endure in their lifetime)Will it get so bad that the dumb die off without reproducing and the smart spawn the next generation? Probably not. If anything, technologists will be ensuring that the new technology is making new and exciting things possible even for those of us with lower than average intelligence.So, in summary. If human evolution is a leisurely pace through the park, technology is light-speed. It would be silly to think that our technology has no effect on the evolutionary flows, but specifically what could be a conversation with no end.

4,"They are being totally reshaped. Every time the cost of communication drops, it fundamentally changes our social environment. Each social interaction has an opportunity cost, time spent with somebody is not time spent with somebody else and time shared is not equivalent to one on one time. Since technology radically changes those costs because we can talk to people that were not geographically or even economically close to us or because we get new filters and notification, the cost of existing relations and new ones are different from before the introduction of those new technologies.

Since technology radically changes those costs because we can talk to people that were not geographically or even economically close to us or because we get new filters and notification, the cost of existing relations and new ones are different from before the introduction of those new technologies. Unfortunately we often see short-term gain and forget long-term losses.For example, through instant reward talking to you right now and with no risk of whole day long argumentation, maybe I am neglecting those around me.Another obvious changes is that communicating altogether is easier. It changes how we manage alerts (e.g. CrisisMappers or Ushahidi) and how we take decision, thus politics.I do not think it is either entirely positive nor negative but I am sure that coping with new ways and avoiding their pitfalls is stressful and it will remain so with all new technology.Note that another aspect rarely mentioned but the other side of the same coin is the cost of isolation. It is often said that, to build oneself time alone is important. Yet since the trend is for ubiquitous connectivity and constant availability one could want to consider more than the cost of communication but also how easily one can dedicate time without human relationships.See also",0 followers,Vijay Odedra,5.1K,928,36.7M,2011,https://www.quora.com/Are-people-evolving-to-become-more-intelligent-with-time-and-technology

Get into the action with some hobby project, start reading about it, read the documentation and basically learn by practice. As a result I’m more or less a polyglot in programming languages. Which is nice.And newer techniques like embedded programming? Well, I started with an Arduino board, got a few more, got some raw IC’s to program, some NodeMCU boards and DigiSparks and brushed up my C knowledge while creating small hardware with all kinds of communication options like WiFi, BlueTooth and even some generic radio communication. Am also playing now with small solar panels with rechargeable batteries and small LED lights to make simple solar lamps.Which brings me to my 3D modeling practice. Once 3D modeling became popular, I started collecting several tools to design and render 3D models into simple artwork. This art could then be used on the websites I’m developing. (Better than ‘stealing’ from the Internet.) I started learning about importing and exporting models in various file formats and when 3D printing started to become more easily available I also started experimenting in 3D printing. Today, I have over 50 small figurines that are 3D printed and some small boxes and cases from my own (cheap) 3D printer.But I also use older techniques sometimes. For example, I make my own electronics and it needs cases to cover it up and to make it look pretty. So I’m also doing some simple handwork with plaster, wood and resin to create simple containers becauseWith all this practice, I get a good understanding of the Internet-Of-Things, which happens to be one of the latest technologies. For example, understanding power management in battery-operated hardware, as electronics can be power-hungry. Or the security issues with devices that connect to the Internet, yet also need a user to connect to them. (Which is a chicken-and-egg problem.) Or the size and heating problems that small devices have. And even some understanding of mobile phones through a GSM module that I have. Great for sending and receiving SMS messages, btw.Most of this are plain hobby projects that I do next to my regular job as software developer. It takes a lot of time, though.
