He told me something amazing.“You know, I just don’t think most people are curious at all.”I was intrigued and asked him to explain.“Well, a lot of people around me don’t even look stuff up in Google.”I was flabbergasted.He explained that a lot of times people will ask him things and he will turn around and just Google for the answer and then tell them. He runs a small software company and had to explain this to his people.I was blown away.He then explained how other friends and family just aren’t very often curious enough to look anything up themselves on Google or in books or anything.For a bit of context, both he and I read a lot of books, write a lot of code, and spend hours each day using Google. Both of us are successful, expert-level programmers at this point.It was an enlightening conversation and we both came to the conclusion that one of our real super powers is our ability to use Google and books and other sources of information to solve problems. And critically … we are both curious enough to do that for ourselves!The average person often isn’t curious enough to even go on Quora and ask a question. Now, you might think that’s crazy (being that you are reading this on Quora), but consider this super interesting fact …A popular writer sells thousands of books, or maybe tens or hundreds of thousands of books (fewer than say 100 ever sell a million), a popular Quora writer gets millions of article views, but a popular television or movie personality will be watched and listened to BILLIONS AND BILLIONS of times.Pick something likeThat is a long-winded way of saying that people would rather be sitting down watching a movie or TV show than they would do just about anything else with their free time.So, most people aren’t nearly as curious as they are willing to watch TV and movies.However, the handful of people who are curious about things have a tremendous knowledge advantage over basically everyone else. While everyone else is being entertained, the curious are using Google, YouTube, etc. to learn things and solve problems and ultimately improve their life.Programmers are no exception to this. The curious ones use GoogleThose of us who have reached a level of expertise in the field of software development all have a pretty high effectiveness at using Google, Stack Overflow, and traditional books to build a knowledge advantage.At this particular point in history, that knowledge advantage is extremely valuable.-BrianP.S.

But in general, you don’t really need that powerful of a computer for programming, but it really sucks if your computer isn’t powerful enough.2. Adequate deskYou don’t need a super awesome desk, but having enough desk space, and having everything laid out in a comfortable way is very important to being productive.Programming with a setup like that is not going to be all that great.3. Good chair or standing deskHaving a good chair is extremely important. You’re going to be spending a lot of time in that chair, you want to be as comfortable as possible, and you don’t want to fuck up your back.4. Good screenJust like your chair, you’re going to be spending a lot of time looking at it, so having a screen that is nice to look at is important. Also make sure that your monitor setup suits you well, some people like more than one monitor, some people can’t stand multiple displays. A great piece of software to complement your screen is a program called5. Good keyboardSome people think that having a great keyboard is something that every programmer needs to have, but to be completely honest, unless you’re getting RSI issues, you don’t really need anything all that fancy. I personally use a mechanical keyboard, so that’s another option to look at. Getting a good keyboard is more of a luxury, not a necessity.

It depends on what your boss expects.Pro Tip: in startups, if the team doesn’t do documentation, when the startup begins to become successful and they hire more devs, the new devs will take way too long to become productive, because they don’t know the code.

It was also fun going above and beyond the requirements and making something amazing (at the time).I know this isn’t much today, but my teacher was pretty damn impressed.

10,"Okay. So you've figured out that you would like to write for magazines, newspapers, and e-zines. Unfortunately, so have about eight gazillion other people on this planet.

The first secret you must learn in this funny business is that you dont have to write the whole article to get a job. Only bright green novices attempt to write the whole thing before selling it. What you do need, however, is the IDEA for the great story. You will use this great idea to convince eOkay. So you've figured out that you would like to write for magazines, newspapers, and e-zines. Unfortunately, so have about eight gazillion other people on this planet. Therefore, you have to stand out from the crowd. You have to sparkle. How do you do this? Simple. It all starts with The Big Idea. The first secret you must learn in this funny business is that you dont have to write the whole article to get a job. Only bright green novices attempt to write the whole thing before selling it. What you do need, however, is the IDEA for the great story. You will use this great idea to convince editors to pay you exorbitant amounts of money via a proposal letter (called a query letter. But you'll learn about that in a minute).So, where will you find this Big Idea? Well, you've heard that wise adage write what you know. That's a wonderful mantra for finding your jumping-off point. You dont need to stick to what you know for the specific focus of your story but tap into your already huge vat of knowledge to find the storys basis. This is how you will become an expert. Experts are in demand. People with stories aren't. What you have to do is sneak your stories into your areas of expertise. For example let's say your hobbies and interests include fishing, watching talk shows, and traveling. Good! You are a potential expert in those areas. Jot these things down. Now comes the fun part: brainstorming.The biggest mistake you can make in pitching your story is being too general. Never, ever send a letter to the editor suggesting an article about fishing. Not even an article about fishing in Florida. This vagueness is not appropriate for short writing. In general, you will be expected to write somewhere between 800 and 2000 words on your topic. You couldn't possibly tell us all about fishing in 2000 words. What you could do, however, is give us a comparison of twelve different lures used to catch sailfish. Or the pros and cons of joining a fishing club. Or even how the moon can tell you if it'll be a good fishing day.So here's your first assignment. Get out your trusty notebook. (If you dont have one, stop reading and get one. Right now.) On the first page, write down a list of any topics that interest you. It's okay to be general here. Need some ideas to get you started?Think through your whole day. Dont neglect anything. What do you do from the moment you wake up until the moment you fall asleep? You turn off your alarm clock. (An article about alarm clocks disrupting valuable sleep stages! Or waking up to music versus waking up to that annoying beeping sound. Or the optimal number of times to press the snooze button.) You brush your teeth. (Article: What all those touted ingredients fluorides, peroxide, baking soda do for your teeth.) You take a shower. Maybe with your significant other. Lucky you. (Romantic showers for two.)Moving on. You go to work. This is the most obvious area of expertise. Let's say you're a secretary. How ergonomic office equipment can save you from Carpal Tunnel Syndrome, an achy back, and a stiff neck. How to avoid screaming at your boss when he's a total idiot. Five couples (or ex-couples) share their wisdom about dating in the office. Think about what cover story would entice you to pay three dollars for a magazine. You dont have to know to write the article yet. You just have to know you can get this information later.Next, you come home. What happens? Do you have kids? Great! A wealth of article ideas. You could write about childcare agencies, potty training, decoding teenage slang, teaching table manners youre getting the idea now, right? Run with it!Write at least one page of general topics that interest you, then weed out the most interesting ones. Narrow it down to three or four. Then write those three or four topics on top of brand new pages. Now fill up those pages with specific article angles. Just write. Dont edit yourself. Dont judge. Just write whatever pops into your head. If you need motivation, play it like a game of Scattergories. Set a timer for ten minutes. See how many ideas you can jot down before the timer sounds.Keep in mind that there are markets for almost any conceivable topic. Dont limit yourself to the headlines you'd read in Vogue and Good Housekeeping. Between newspapers, consumer magazines, trade magazines, e-zines, tabloids, literary journals, and more, you're bound to find an appropriate publication for your Big Idea.Do you want to know more about these markets? Read on!Researching the MarketsFirst, you'll need a few definitions:Consumer Magazines: These typically pay the best. These are the types of magazines you might find in a grocery store check-out line, convenience store, in your airplane seat pocket, or your doctor's office. Types of consumer mags: men, women, special interest, inflight, teens, school/career, travel, health, ethnic/minority, political, entertainment, romance, religious, etc. This is the area most writers try to break into.Literary Magazines: These dont pay much, if at all. However, what they lack in the moolah, they make up for in prestige. If youre looking to jump-start your career as a fiction writer or poet, your best chance at recognition may come in the form of one of these small publications. Often published by colleges and universities, their circulation is usually regional and low. They generally seek scholarly essays, intellectually challenging prose, poetry, and book reviews. Publishers will be impressed if you succeed in placing your work in one of the more prominent journals (Cimarron Review, Ploughshares, and Story, for example).Trade Journals: Pay varies greatly. Any publication that focuses on a particular occupation/industry falls into this category. This is where your expertise can shine. There are trade journals for almost every line of work, from art dealers to truck drivers. In general, your written eloquence is not as important as your research and timely knowledge for these publications.E-Zines: Pay varies greatly. Simply put, e-zines are simply magazines on the Internet. The only major difference is that articles for e-zines can usually run longer than print magazines. (No printing costs, so space isn't as important an issue for e-zine editors.) Most e-zines dont pay (except using a byline) but this trend is changing. The most popular sites (Now that you know, learn how to contact them!There are tons of ways to find markets that are open to freelancers. If you were paying attention, you might notice that this very website is looking for writers! Finding places to submit your work is easy if you know where to look.First, the most important tool in a freelancer's toolbox is The Writers Market. Available at any major bookstore, this is an annual compilation of more than 2,000 magazines, 1,000 book publishers, and even specialized markets like greeting cards, scriptwriting, and syndicates.The next best tools are online. Lucky you! They're free. Absolute Market is a weekly e-zine filled with market guidelines, contest listings, and marketing tips. Freelancing4Money puts out a jam-packed e-zine filled with freelance opportunities. Writer's Digest has a great, searchable database of markets. Writing For Dollars has a biweekly newsletter with market guidelines and a searchable database on the website. And Writers Weekly lists calls for writers and market guidelines each week.You can even run a search for freelance writers on any major search engine, and youre likely to come up with tons of listings. Try specifying if possible; add words that fit your needs. (Example: paying markets, romance, teen magazines.)So, your next assignment is this: go back to your trusty notebook and pick out your very favorite idea. That will now be known as your Big Idea. Pick the markets that best fit your idea. Choose several. Find out if you can get a free or discounted sample copy. (Writers often can, if you specify that you would like to query them in the future.) Request writer's guidelines if available. It's considered poor form to query publications that you've never read, or know nothing about. Do your best to read at least one copy of whatever magazine or journal you plan to query. Check your library for copies if you prefer not to go broke researching.Got it now? You have your idea, and you've found places to submit it? Great! Then you'll need to learn the proper protocol for writing and submitting the Killer Query.The Killer QueryThe job of the query letter is to entice an editor to say, Hey! It is interested in learning more about that. Therefore, you dont want to spill all your secrets and research yet. You want to tease and tantalize. Now that you've got your fabulous Big Idea, your job is to condense (or expand) that idea into two to three paragraphs.To illustrate the components of a killer query, here is an example of one of mine (using fictitious contact info sorry!) that landed me the assignment:Jenna Glatzer(Always use proper formal letter format)123 My AddressMy City, State, Zip Code(555) 555-5555Mr. Joe Shmoe(Make SURE to get a name of the appropriate department College Life 101editor. Never address a letter to editor or submissions.)123 Their AddressTheir City, State, Zip CodeToday's Date, 2003Dear Mr. Shmoe:(Colons are used in formal letters. Commas are used in friendly letters.)Think company cars, expense accounts, and a spacious office with bay windows. Who do you picture running a business this successful?(Start the letter with a zinger that captures the essence of your proposed article/story. Raise a question that will cause the reader to think, or give a visual image of anything that will make him/her want to read on and find out what youre talking about.)Think again. This company was the brainchild of three Boston University sophomores whose ambitions led them to thriving careers before they had diplomas to hang on the wall.(The rest of the first paragraph should give a concise description of the focus of your proposed article. Remember to tell why it's appropriate to the publication youre querying. In this case, I was targeting a college magazine, so I made sure to emphasize the relevance to their subject matter early in the letter.)Charles Strader, Richard Skelton, and Pablo Mondal run Net One, an Internet Service Provider. The three men in the freshmen dorms then moved into an apartment together. Opportunity knocked when Strader, who worked for the university's computer center, took a phone call from the owner of a hair salon. She sought help designing a website; Strader volunteered, and Net One was born.(Again, concisely, get a little deeper into the content of the article. What is special about your story? In this case, I wanted to emphasize that these guys were college buddies who started a booming business by branching out from their humble beginning.)Working closely with friends to build something we believe in is Monday's favorite perk. Skelton agrees. We have great trust in each other and feel that we're all in this together.(Quotations aren't necessary for a query, but it's nice to give something specific to show that you have done some research into your topic and that you have access to resources that will enable you to write the article well. I wanted to show that I had already spoken to these guys they happen to be friends of mine and that they would be upbeat and inspirational people to interview. You can accomplish the same effect by including a few quirky facts or survey results you've found out about your topic.)Considering that their only capital was a computer and a small loan from Strader's father, the guys feel very successful. We're not millionaires, but we have goals, and we're following them, says Skelton. I think that's true success. By any definition, Net One's roster of more than 50 clients ranging from colleges to Fortune 500 companies attests to their hard work and talent.(Look, editor. These guys are big up-and-comers! Notice I mentioned Fortune 500 companies. This lets the editor know quickly that these college guys arent small potatoes. It neatly ties up the opening sentence, which promised an article about guys who have a spacious office, expense accounts, and company cars. Now the editor has a reason to believe that these guys are that successful.)I propose a 1,000-word profile for your Students At Work section.(Shows I've researched their magazine. I know which section this should fit, and I've read their guidelines to determine an appropriate word count.)I am a full-time freelance writer, and my works have been recently featured in such publications as 201 Magazine, College Bound(Notice I mention the most relevant magazines first. Anything you've had published that might relate to the content, tone, or audience of the proposed publication belongs here.)Bliss!, Working Women, and Video Librarian. Clips are enclosed.(If you've never had anything published, dont distress. Just shut up about it. Do NOT tell anyone, Though I've never been published yet, I'm a real go-getter. Less is more. If you keep quiet, they may not even think about the fact that you didn't mention your credits. Also, do not get into a diatribe describing how you edited your high school newspaper. Just a quick list of relevant writing backgrounds. See below for info about clips.)I can provide documentation and interview notes for easy fact-checking, and could submit the completed article within two weeks.(Optional. Some people like to suggest a time frame, others let the editor do it. In general, the editor will tell you when the article is due, regardless of your preferences. It's a nice touch to mention how you will research your article. Mine was primarily dependent on interviews, but you may wish to include the names of journals/experts you plan to quote or use for information.)I look forward to your response.(Obligatory polite ending. Use any variation you wish. No pleading. If you dare type, I promise to write a good article! Please hire me! you will incur my wrath. I will hunt you down and yell at you. A lot. Just a simple, dignified ending requesting a response.)Regards,Jenna Glatzer(Oh. Substitute your name and preferred signature ending. Unless you feel like sending your paycheck to me, in which case, you can feel free to use my name. Grin.)Finally, clips! If you've had anything published or even if you haven't, but you have a few good writing samples appropriate for this type of market include them. These samples are called clips, and they are used to show the editor that you are an intelligent, insightful, funny, clever, and/or excellent writer. Photocopy your articles straight from the publication. Just 2-3 clips.When you're sending queries by e-mail, you can paste the text of your clips into the body of the e-mail (never as an attachment!), or you can direct the editor to one or two website URLs where she can view your articles.Interviews and ProfilesI know you feel weird about this one, right? You're uncomfortable calling someone or visiting a business to ask a professional to take precious time out of their day to help you research your article.Well, buck up, little camper, because most professionals love to be interviewed. They jump at the chance, for a few reasons. These are the reasons to keep in mind when you feel small and silly for asking:Before you approach experts:Make sure you already have your questions mapped out, at least briefly. What exactly do you need to know from this person? What could this person tell you that no one else can? Avoid yes or no questions. Ask open-ended questions that could lead to lengthy responses chock full of great quotes. Also, have a synopsis of your planned article ready, so you can tell your expert what youre writing and how they can supplement your knowledge.How to approach experts:Get on the phone. Have your idea condensed into 2-3 sentences, so you can quickly explain yourself to whoever answers the phone.Hello. My name is Jenna, and I'm writing an article about the rise in vegetarianism among young women in Nevada for Youth In Nevada Magazine. I know Dr. Spuds is a well-respected nutritionist, and I'm hoping she would be willing to answer a few questions on this subject.At this point, the secretary will say, Hold, and make you listen to elevator music while she summons the boss. Or she'll take down your number and have Dr. Spuds call you back. Or it will be Dr. Spuds herself, and shell say, What do you want to know?Your options at this point are (1) Ask questions over the phone, right then and there. Make sure you check to make sure your expert is not pressed for time before you begin. (2) Set up a phone date to conduct the interview. (3) Ask if you can meet in person. This is good almost necessary if the person will be the focus of your article. If the person is being used just to add a few quotes, you dont have to meet in person, because it's unlikely you'll ever need to write, Dr. Spuds wrinkled her brow and stared into her pea soup as she explained that young women are becoming more health-conscious. (4) Trade e-mail addresses and send over a list of questions. This approach isn't usually the best, because it doesn't allow you to react to, and build from, the information you gain in answers to previous questions. However, if the publication will not reimburse you for long-distance phone calls, and you have to conduct a lengthy interview, e-mail exchanges are acceptable. Just make! sure you specify a due date for the responses. Be reasonabletry to give the expert a week to answer all your questions.The SalesOkay, you sent out your killer query, and you got a phone call from an editor with the big news: you got the assignment! Congratulations, you! Go on and do a little dance of joy, then crash back to reality with your new mantra: GET IT IN WRITING. Make sure the editor tells you that a written contract is forthcoming shortly.If you've researched your market, you probably already have an idea of the pay rate, but be sure to cover this ground in that initial phone call if the editor fails to mention it. Important things to remember:On Publication vs. On AcceptanceYou not only need to know how much you'll be paid but also when you'll be paid. Many markets want to pay you for publication. This can be a problem because many magazines and journals have long lead times. (Translation: a long time between when they assign you the article and when it ends up in print.) If you write an article in January, and it doesn't get published until November, you probably won't see a check until December. Do you want to wait a year to get paid? Can you wait that long? This is a point you absolutely can negotiate. Ask for payment on acceptance. If this is refused, it gives you a little leverage to work with on the other issues, which areKill FeesIf you get the assignment, and, for whatever reason, an editor decides not to print your article, you can negotiate for a kill fee. This is a percentage of the sale price. If you are offered $200 to write an article, you may get a $50 kill fee. It's a well-known fact that big publications kill articles all the time. Some editors admit to assigning 10-20% more than they could ever fit in the magazine. They do this so they can pick and choose from the final products, or so they can see how things fit once the layout is complete. Some articles will be pushed back to other issues, and some will just be trashed.BiosWe like them. Those are the little blurbs that often follow an article, giving short biographical information about the writer, and sometimes an e-mail address or phone number. Ask for one if you can.Sidebars and PhotosThose are the little factoids or columns that rest next to the main article. For example, in an article about exercise, you'll often see a little chart on the side that tells how many calories are burned by doing specific exercises (riding a bike, climbing a hill, etc.). If you can suggest sidebars, you can often get extra pay. Same goes for photos. If you've got a decent camera and a good eye, offer photos for a few extra bucks.To Spec or Not To SpecEspecially as a novice writer, you'll sometimes get asked to write an article on speculation. This means that you'll have to write the whole article and submit it without a contract, or any promise of payment. It's a bone of contention among professional writers because almost no other field works this way. It's never doing the job, and then I'll decide if I feel like paying you. Only in this crazy business. Harrumph.That said, I advise you to take spec assignments in the beginning. Once youre established, you shouldn't need to do this, but to build up your resume and your clips, you need to get published. So go ahead and submit on spec, and go ahead and do a few free/nearly free pieces for the experience.Before submitting anything, though, make sure you know in advance what the terms will be if the editor does use your piece. How much will you be paid? What rights will they buy?Even many of the big markets have adopted the practice of requesting pieces on spec. They do this because they can get away with it. Because there are thousands of wannabe writers out there who will beg, borrow, and steal for the chance to be published. So, if you want to compete, sometimes you have to suck it up and accept this. Once the publication accepts one of your spec pieces, youll be a much more likely candidate for an outright assignment next time.Rights to WriteThere are several kinds of rights a publication may buy:First North American Serial RightsThe newspaper or magazine has the right to publish this piece for the first time in any periodical. All other rights belong to the writer.One-Time RightsThe publication buys the nonexclusive right to publish the piece once. The writer can sell the same article to other publications simultaneously.Second Serial Rights (or Reprint Rights)Also nonexclusive. Gives the publication the right to reprint an article that has appeared elsewhere.Electronic RightsCovers CD-ROMs, e-zines, website content, games, etc. Get in writing which electronic rights are specified-- First Electronic Rights, archiving rights, etc. Most publications ask for the right to archive ""indefinitely."" You can try to negotiate for a fixed term (i.e., archiving rights for six months).All RightsPretty is self-explanatory. You can never sell this piece to anyone else again. Try to avoid this one. Most publications ask for First Serial Rights.Work-For-Hire Rights-- The publication has come up with the idea and assigned it to you, and they will own it, lock, stock, and barrel. They own the copyright and don't even have to give you credit. It may be sliced, diced, repackaged, re-sold, etc., and you won't have any claim to it beyond what you were originally paid.TV/Motion Picture RightsAlso self-explanatory. Almost always exclusive.Recycling Your Big IdeasThis is the bread and butter of freelance writing. It's also called re-slanting. Once you've got a Big Idea, dont waste it by only using it once. Use the information you've gathered and come up with off-shoot ideas. Slant it to appeal to different markets.You're afraid because of the issue of rights that we just discussed, right? (No pun intended.) Well, you have nothing to fear, provided the new article is sufficiently different in content and intended audience. If you've managed to sell your article to a major national magazine, it is considered poor form to try to sell a re-slanted version to another national magazine.However, if youre dealing with regional, specialized, or small publications, there should be a very little overlap of the intended audience. Therefore, an editor from Alabama Aristocrats would probably never know if you sold a re-slanted version of your piece to Guitarists Today. Even if they did know, they almost certainly would not care.It is standard and accepted practice, for the simple reason that it is darn difficult to make a living as a writer. If you have the choice between making $100 for selling your piece to one small publication, or making $1000 by selling altered versions to eight different small publications, which would you choose?Re-slanting an article is easy since you've done the bulk of the research. Scrounge up a few new quotes, and use the information you left out of the first article. Focus it on the new desired market.For example, I could sell an article about the health benefits of meditation to a fitness magazine. A few alterations and that same article become Religions Encouraging Meditation for my local newspapers Society pages. Then it becomes Meditation Makes You Smarter for the college market. Then, Meditate Your Stress Away for a working woman magazine. And I didn't even mention all those new age/holistic publications. What a field day!With just a few more questions posed to your trusted experts, you've got a whole new article. And, look! You're becoming an expert yourself. This is how you begin to find your niche few specific subjects that you feel comfortable writing about. Ah, soon those journalists will be coming to YOU with their questions.""The Extras""Once you've got a few assignments, and feel that you've embarked on this as a potential career (or just a part-time income-booster), youll want to think about the little extras.A nice touch: get yourself some nice letterhead. Splurge a little with your second or third paycheck and invest in professionally printed letterhead. The presentation does count when submitting your correspondence to an editor. Avoid cutesy clip art of quill pens and inkwells.Also, an invoice. You should always include an invoice with your completed article. Often, the person you submit the story to is not the same in charge of sending you a paycheck. By including an invoice, you can be reasonably assured that the billing department will have a record of what terms were agreed upon, and when they are supposed to pay you.Receipts: Hold onto your postage receipts and your writing-related supplies. If writing is your profession, then these can be tax write-offs. Also, if you can negotiate it, editors will often reimburse you for any expenses you incur while on assignment once you are an established writer. Submit your phone bill (with the reimbursable call/s circled), your book receipts, your travel expense receipts, etc. along with your invoice. Make sure these terms are specified in your contract.You're ready? Good! Get out there and get 'em, slugger.

It looked like this:But he’s a 180 pound man. Even though he’s tiny, he’s still 180 pounds. And that 180 pounds is resting on really tiny legs and feet. The pounds per square inch would be off the charts.In reality, he would easily fall right through the roof. And the car seat, and the undercarriage. He’d hit the pavement, and probably keep going. He’d sink through the concrete, hit dirt, and just keep going. If he hit a thick steel pipe, heHe’s just way too heavy for surfaces to hold him up. The pounds per square inch of his feet is just too high. It’s possible that he would just keep sinking until he got near the center of the earth, and gravity stopped pulling him down. As soon he shrunk, he’d immediately break through whatever he’s standing on.-Another thing is air. Even though Scott Lang is shrunk, he still needs the equal amount of oxygen to survive. He shrinks, but the air around him doesn’t. Scott becomes denser, but the air doesn’t.-Let’s say that in one breath, you bring in a cubic foot of air, which contains 100 oxygen molecules. Your lungs take in the oxygen molecules, and use them to keep you alive. You need to get 100 oxygen molecules per breath, or you’ll asphyxiate.At Scott’s size, he still needs 100 oxygen molecules per breath to stay alive. His body is still the same, just smaller.But his tiny lungs can only take in one cubic inch of air in a single breath. In that cubic inch, there’s probably only a single oxygen molecule. One oxygen molecule isn’t nearly enough to survive.Scott would shrink, survive on last breath he took while normal sized, then immediately asphyxiate.-The exact same principle applies to his vision. His eyes get much smaller, but the amount of visible light stays the same. His tiny eyes would only be receiving a fraction of what normal people would. He would be almost blind.Same thing with his hearing. His ears wouldn’t pick up most noise vibrations, because most would just miss him. He’d be deaf too.On top of it all, his tiny larynx would vibrate much faster than than normal humans, so he would sound like he’d been breathing helium. Not that you’d be able to hear him, because there’s so little air in his lungs, he wouldn’t be able to project his voice at all.-So, when Ant-Man shrunk, he’d be blind, deaf, mute, asphyxiating, and rapidly sinking through the earth.Sorry Scott.",0 followers,Dylan Owens,6.5K,271,26.9M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-most-useful-tools-every-programmer-should-have

He is dead set on steering clear of the time dilation as much as humanly possible. And landing on that planet would be his absolute worst nightmare.Seems logical.

Fuel—in addition to time—is also a factor. They must be smart in their decision making process. And the closest planet to them where the beacon is still going off just so happens to be….The planet within the gravitation time dilation of Gargantua.Now, they know about the time dilation. They realize every hour they spend on that planet known as Miller’s planet—named after the original astronaut who landed there—will cost themBut the beacon is clearly going off, the planet is the closest one to them, and it looks to be habitable from where they are. It’s a watery planet like Earth…Cooper doesn’t want to go, but he’s outvoted by his crew mates. Hence, they travel to Miller’s planet, and if you’ve seen the movie, you know the kind of disaster that awaits them.So, here’s where I have a huge problem with this:Given the extreme time dilation—of which they were aware of—why didn’t any one of these extraordinarily intelligent astronauts consider the fact that Miller had only been on her planet for onlyTo recapitulate, the original explorers were supposed to activate their beaconsRegardless of the signal, however, they should’ve realized thatI just can’t help to feel like anyone capable of critical thinking would’ve at least considered this multi-faceted scenario. And if they weren’t sure, they could’ve made the decision to go to Miller’s planet last, saving time, and saving lives in the process.But fate—or rather the script—had different plans.Credits:https://m.imgur.com/gallery/Sq1Go0WMiller (planet)",381 followers,Darren Bord,2.3K,2.3K,1M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-most-useful-tools-every-programmer-should-have

There's also a practical concern that our bodies cannot withstand long periods of weightlessness. So I don't mind seeing artificial gravity, however it might be explained.There's a technical issue with the amount of extra weight artificial gravity would give your ship. Think about it - when you're accelerating or decelerating, you'd want to have as little mass as possible. Energy supply is never an issue, I suppose, when you have dilithium crystals on board.But here's the thing that truly bugs me about it. If you need to have artifical gravity, why would it run the length of the ship?Wouldn't a ship oriented like a skyscraper make so much more sense?Then, the artificial gravity isnt a big long strip. It's located at just a single point - the bottom of the ship.In fact, when a “tower” ship is accelerating in one direction, it wouldn't even need the artificial gravity, it would just turn it off. Because if the ship is accelerating at 1G, it's making its own gravity.The same would be true when decelerating.So it would be incredibly more efficient, so much more efficient than a ship which is oriented like an aircraft carrier.This “tower” orientation isn't actually new to science fiction either:It's just that at some point, we seemingly lost our way.From the 1970s to now, spaceships all use the awkward “navy in space” look.It's stupid because it makes no sense, and it bugs me every time I see it.",145 followers,Chris Williams,1.8K,177,521.8K,2021,https://www.quora.com/Is-it-conceivable-that-any-human-will-be-remembered-10-000-years-from-now-100-000-Even-longer

Their goals, origins and anything remotely resembling factual information is bare and scarce.The best information on them comes from a series of battles, most notably the Cleansing of the Sak’trada Deeps during the final years of the Great Crusade.

Things we could not even Imagine…Science Fiction was this…This Island Earth— The older, dying Race looking for a place to survive… Bringing Machines that Earthmen could not even begin to understand…With their Spaceships that could rise up on beams of unknown energies, taking unwary scientists away from the world they knew…It was alien ships that crashed near small towns like the one fromIt was the solitary, lone ship cruising through the Vastness of Space…Into the UNKNOWN…To land on planets old and eldritch with ancient relics of unknowable civilizations long gone…It was coming to face with creatures, forces and Monsters to which our weapons and knowledge were worthless toys…having run and hide from something so powerful that it did not care about the little two-legged thing called Man…It was about stumbling across something Incredible, Unexplainable, Inexplicable…That all you could do is look at it and wonder…Or as the woman inThese Past Movies made me look up into the night sky and not just see points of lights…but to wonder WHAT IS HAPPENING OUT THERE?What HAD Happened Out there? A Thousand Years ago?What Might be Out There…RIGHT NOW?Today, by comparison, Sci-Fi movies seem to me to consist primarily of Military-Tech-Porn-fests.Men go forth from the Earth and immediately start plundering worlds, subjugating alien races, fighting wars of interstellar empire. Every ship is loaded with an obligatory Space Marine Troop battalion, has a major dreadnought sized gun or weapon mounted.Or there are No Real Unknowns, No Mysteries.The FIRST Star Trek was about Exploring the Galaxy:But after that, every later version of Star Trek had basically turned the Universe into a big interstellar Mall…Every Alien Race can be talked to…Every Planet can be walked on…Every piece of alien technology can be understood, even if the last living alien died a Million years ago…The Only Mysteries that exist are Physics Models and Complex Math Equations……Or if the problem can’t be solved by the Scientist, the Marine standing behind him will pull out a big honking gun and start shouting as he mows down everything in front of him…Mind you. I like a Good Let’s-Mow-the-Bug-Monsters-down flick with the big honking space guns and the massive Star Destroyers rumbling across the screen just as much as everyone else…And Yet…the Old Movies did not have the power of the CGI workstations…so they had to rely on evoked Moods and Dialogue.The Catch of the Breath…The Pause followed by the incredulous look of awe…The sudden Silence that would invoke the chill down your spine as the characters faced something beyond their imagination…Remember the Old Voice Over from the Old Outer Limits?“…For the Next Hour sit quietly and we will control all that you see and hear…You are about to Participate in a Great Adventure…You are about to experience the Awe and Mystery that reaches from the Inner Mind …to the Outer Limits…”This is what I miss from today’s Sci-Fi Movies.",UNKNOWN,Toribio A.

Apparently, the picture below is the natural progression of weapon technology, at least as far as the main characters are concerned:Shown are the bat’leth from Star Trek, the crysknife from Dune, and of course the lightsaber from Star Wars (while Star Wars technically takes place in the past, it’s still a futuristic/sci-fi setting).Various explanations are offered for this. Dune has ‘defensive energy shields’ that block all projectiles, while it explodes upon being hit by lasers (which seems implausible, given that a laser is just coherent light). Star Wars has the Force. The bat’leth has no excuse apart from being ceremonial.It’s not difficult to understand why sci-fi writers do this. Melee fights are cool and relatable. They can be dragged out more which is useful when you want to have a duel between your protagonist and antagonist.The problem is that you don’t bring a knife to a gun fight in the modern era, let alone in the future. There’s a reason why our weapon technology developed in such a way to value efficiency over anything else.If a (magic) shield is discovered that can stop projectiles, this would lead to an arms race to create more powerful weapons and ways to disable the shield. It does not make sense that two combatants would instead resort back to melee weapons, which is an undesireable situation for both.Guns are also far easier to use than melee weapons, hence it is more efficient to equip large armies with them. Sure, melee weapons do have their uses, for example for concealed carrying. A knife will likely never get out of fashion. But why would you use a melee weapon in a war?And when sci-fi movies do include guns, they often look a lot like the weapons we use today and even use conventional bullets. Like this modified Bushmaster ACR from the movie Oblivion.I would like to see more sci-fi movies that drop this trope and dare to come up with creative weapon designs. And where it’s okay that the protagonist just shoots the bad guy or nukes him from orbit. We don’t always need a dragged-out melee fight.EDIT: Several people are coming up with counterarguments such as ‘most people in Star Wars use blasters’, ‘many people in Star Trek use phasers’, and so on. That is not my point.My point is that there’s a trope where the hero and the bad guy fight it out using melee weapons. It’s okay that this happens in, say, a James Bond movie, but it’s unrealistic when it happens so often in science-fiction.",96 followers,Samuel Sebastian,741,412,1.1M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What%E2%80%99s-one-inaccuracy-in-a-science-fiction-movie-that-drives-you-crazy

49,"13. The Matrix – Humans are Terrible BatteriesThe Great War between the humans and the machines in13. The Matrix – Humans are Terrible BatteriesThe Great War between the humans and the machines inThe real truth, though, is this: humans make terrible power sources. We don’t produce much heat or electricity. There’s a good reason that we die quickly when left exposed in the cold. The machines didn’t need us at all. They could have just wiped us out quickly and spent their time perfecting things like nuclear energy. Or wind power. Or geothermal/natural gas fuels. Any of those things would have worked better, with the bonus of not having to fight a war against the Zion resistance fighters who had a literal God on their side.12. Alien: Resurrection – Clones Don’t Have MemoriesThe saga of Ellen Ripley appeared to reach its inevitable conclusion at the end ofSince the original Ripley was dead, they conjured up a story where she was cloned 200 years after her death. Only this time, some of the xenomorph’s DNA got spliced in with hers, creating a more powerful Ripley, with enhanced strength and reflexes to go along with acidic blood and a psychic link to other Aliens. She also retained some of Ripley’s memories, but there’s no real explanation for that. After all, a close is a perfect genetic match but memories aren’t stored in a person’s DNA. In reality, Ripley-8 (as she was dubbed) would have no idea she was a clone unless someone told her.11. Gravity – George Clooney Wouldn’t Keep Floating AwayGravityThe pair were on the verge of being stranded in space when Stone (Bullock) manages to catch her foot on the cords of a parachute. At that point, it appears that the two have stopped drifting away from the International Space Station. Stone would only have had to give Kowalski a slight tug towards her to change his momentum and save them both.10. X-Men – Evolution Doesn’t Work Like ThatWe hate to be too nitpicky about a franchise of films and comics that we do love, but the underlying science behind the entire X-Men story is pretty flawed. We understand that the concept of some humans being born with mutations that gift them amazing powers makes for a great comic book, but science doesn’t work like that in real life. If, as Magento constantly claims, humans have evolved, then we need to take a closer look at the science of evolution.In reality, evolution is a painfully slow process. We’re talking hundreds of thousands of years, maybe even millions, before any species develop enough of an evolutionary change that it can be classified as a new species. Yet, in the X-Men movies (and comics), humans just start randomly popping up with incredible healing powers, laser eyeballs, the ability to control the weather, and tremendous psychic and telekinetic abilities.9. The Core – Almost EverythingHere’s the summary of 2003’sThere are multiple problems withOn top of all that, Earth’s magnetic field has almost nothing to do with keeping microwave radiation out. Most of the sun’s microwaves entering Earth’s atmosphere are just light. If something were to happen to our magnetic field, we’d probably just end up with a heap of dead cellphones, radios, and wireless routers.8. Prometheus – “Half-Billion Miles Away From Earth”This is a really simple one, but it’s still hard to believe no one noticed it. In the secretive Ridley ScottHowever, one single light-year is 5,865,696,000,000 miles. So they are much farther away from our home planet. In reality, a “half-billion miles” would put the crew of the7. Waterworld — There’s Just Not That Much WaterWe loveWhile it’s an interesting concept and harsh commentary on what we are currently doing to our planet, it would never look like that. There’s just not enough water in the Earth’s atmosphere to flood everything as6. The Black Hole – Black Holes Would Likely Just Kill EveryoneWe’ll offer some forgiveness for this 1979 Disney film since it’s close to four decades old at this point. However, it still deserves some scorn for is a shoddy depiction of black holes, one of the universe’s greatest mysteries. In the movie, theIn real life, they would almost certainly be pulled apart at a molecular level and die instantly. Instead, the crew has a bunch of psychedelic visions resembling Heaven and Hell. I guess we can’t be sure, but we’re 99 percent certain that that wouldn’t happen in real life. In the movie, the ship then emerges from a white hole (the opposite of a black hole) and everyone is just fine.5. Total Recall – Exploding HumansThis classic Arnold Schwarzenegger sci-fi/action movieIn reality, a human stuck on the surface of Mars without the protection of a spacesuit or some sort of biodome wouldn’t expand and pop like a balloon. The reality is that Mars is basically freezing at all times, and even the temperature at the equator on a sunny Summer day, when the planet is at its closest orbit point to the sun, the temperature only gets to about 20 Celsius. When not in direct sunlight (or in any other season), the red planet plunges to -75 C and can get as cold as -125 C. In those conditions, frostbite, and hypothermia would kick in almost immediately. Hypoxia (a lack of oxygen in the bloodstream) would start within a minute or so. You would simultaneously freeze and suffocate in a matter of minutes. No exploding faces, though.4. Independence Day – Those Ships Were Too BigForget about the more commonly cited scientific problem withDirector Ronald Emmerich wanted to give audiences an “OMG” moment when he first revealed the ships that planted themselves over New York, L.A., Washington D.C., and other major cities around the world. There are two scientific problems with how huge they are, though. First, they would massively mess with gravity, since they are large enough to have their gravitational pull. Secondly, those ships probably still killed a bunch of people even after the humans figured out how to destroy them. All that ship has to crash land somewhere, and since the ships hovered over major urban centers, the death toll from “winning” the war was probably still in the tens (or hundreds) of millions.3. Outbreak – The Virus Would Kill Too Quickly, Plus Inoculations Take YearsWhileDustin Hoffman saves the day in the end, finding the original host animal (a cute capuchin monkey) and quickly using her antibodies to produce a cure. It made for a thrilling conclusion to the film, but it was hardly based on reality. If a virus like the fictional Motaba illness hit a town, there would be no need to quarantine everyone or execute a firebomb plan to irradiate all traces of the virus — everyone would be dead without 36-48 hours anyway.Additionally, even if a cure was eventually found, these types of medical processes take months (and even years) of time to produce. Dustin Hoffman wouldn’t be hacking it together with the blood of a lost monkey, just in the nick of time.2. Lucy – We Already Use 100 Percent of Our BrainsIn 2014, Scarlett Johansson starred inIn reality, humans do use more than 10 percent of brains, they just use different portions of it for different tasks. The brain activity for remembering things from your childhood is different than the brain activity when you are working out or sleeping, for example. If a human uses 100 percent of their brain at once, they would likely fall into an instant coma and probably end up dead. If1. The Day After Tomorrow – Almost EverythingUnless you’re one of those crazy people who don’t believe that climate change is a real thing, it’s pretty obvious that the Earth’s environment is slowly changing. But when we say changes, we mean very gradual changes. Yes, the average temperatures are rising, but in decimal points of a degree. Yes, the water levels are rising faster than ever before, but it’s still a very slow process. Unless you find yourself in the 2004 disaster filmHowever, scientists know that ice ages take millions and millions of years to develop. They don’t stroll in with a snowy Northern hurricane over a weekend.

It spans from the esophagus to the colon and consists of more neurons than there are located in the spinal cord.The enteric nervous system controls the entire digestive system, as well as regulating hormones. It plays a major role in our emotions and behavior by communicating with the central nervous system via the vagus nerve.Surprisingly, it can even function without receiving signals from the brain. The digestive system would continue performing its tasks as usual even if the vagus nerve were severed.Because the enteric nervous system independently controls so many different functions, it is often referred to as the “second brain”.You have probably heard the phrases “gut feeling” and “butterflies in the stomach”. These distinct feelings are a result of the enteric nervous system releasing hormones.(3) About every five years, all the atoms in your body get replaced.This can lead to some interesting and perplexing questions.What makes youIt cannot be your memories, opinions, or personality that make you who you are, because those things also change.This leads us to a paradox analogous to this problem, a paradox known as theSuppose there is a ship whose planks are replaced one at a time over the course of a few years.

Lol: Read on!Picture a clitoris in your mind. Got it? Now, what if I told you that what you're imagining is just the tip of an iceberg and there is a whole lot of clitoral goodness hidden inside a treasure chest ( pelvis). The clitoris is only partially visible to the naked eye. Yes, the clitoris is actually close to four inches in length (the average non-erect penis) but three-fourths of it is hidden from view within a female’s body. It's buried a treasure. and, when erect, it actually wraps around the vagina –making the vagina and sex more pleasurable for the man and the woman as the woman gets more excited.The scientific name for the external ""little button"" or “cherry pit” or “joy buzzer“ or ""bulb"" [of the clitoris] isMost women do not have an orgasm through intercourse alone. They think they are abnormal. You aren’t abnormal. You are not alone, 50 to 75 percent of women who have orgasms need to have their clitoris touched (clitoral stimulation).When does Clitoris stop growing?Clitoris gets better with age like old wine. The clitoris grows throughout a woman's life. Hormonal changes lead to the clitoris growing over the course of a woman’s life. The onset of puberty initiates the increase in size. After menopause, the clitoris can become 2.5 times larger than it was when the same woman was a teenager and 7 times bigger than it was at birth. That could be the reason why some women have stronger orgasms in mid-life and into their sixties and beyond. Go the older women!! Women who have given birth tend to have larger clitorises – the longest ever measured was 12""!What happens if women use anabolic steroids? Do the clitoris grows into a penis? Yes, women who take anabolic steroids actually grow their clitorises to look like mini penises. (What?!!)Word of caution: Apparently, the clitoris can get mad at you and disappear. If the clitoris goes unused, it will retreat into the body and the hood will fuse closed, known as clitoral atrophy. You don’t want that to happen, do you? So, use it or lose it. Just like every other tissue in the body, the clitoris requires blood flow to stay happy and healthy. So whatever you do – give your clitoris some love.The clitoris contains about 8,000 sensitive nerve endings, nearly double the nerve endings in the glans of a penis and more than anywhere else in the entire human body. It is highly sensitive, some like it touched gently and some like a little more pressure. Even after having so many nerve endings —Yet more women struggle with the ability to reach orgasm than men do.. and so many times they just fake an orgasm -hmm why?Men and women are more alike than we are different. Did you know that all babies male and female have the exact same genital tissue when they are conceived? During the development phase (Around 12 weeks) in the mother’s womb, each baby’s genitalia begins to differentiate into a penis in a boy or labia in a girl. The clitoris and penis come from the same embryonic tissue but they are just organised in a different way. The clitoris has glans, a foreskin( aka the hood), erectile tissue, and a tiny shaft: all the parts that a penis has. It even swells when it's aroused similar to a penis.Only one-quarter of the clitoris is visible. The rest of the treasure is safely buried inside. I know we talked about it, just making sure it has sunken into your brain.Clitoris is made up theThe clitoris is designed to bring a woman pleasure. That is its sole purpose. A woman has four erogenous zones inside and around the vagina that connect with and stimulate the clitoris. 1. The tip of the clitoris (or C-spot), 2. G-spot and the lesser known 3. A spot and 4. U-spot.For now we know that Reproduction isn’t the purpose of clitoris. But, again We don’t know a whole lot of things about the human body.Did you know that there are different kinds of orgasms: Vaginal, Cervical, and G Spot Orgasms etc, exist, but the easiest is a clitoral orgasm. Yes, there are so many kinds of orgasms. Very few women are able to achieve an orgasm without any kind of clitoral stimulation/ involvement. Some of the ladies have orgasms only through your clitoris.The clitoris varies in size and shape on different women. Some are hidden under the hood, and some pop out. Clitoris is a little complicated than you guys think. Please don't assume that you know what the clitoris likes. No, it definitely doesn’t like to be hit like an elevator button. Take your time and get to know the unique glorious clitoris, each one is special and different and has its own temper and individuality. it’s as important as knowing the woman that it is attached to. (If you don’t understand it, then your woman’s clitoris would just die out of boredom being with you)A clitoral orgasm can bring about anywhere between 3-16 contractions and can last from 10-30 seconds. Also, many women have multiple orgasms that can include pelvic contractions.An average clitoral orgasm lasts longer than even the best male orgasm! Male and female orgasm have been compared and they found out that even the most average clitoral orgasm lasted longer than even the very best ever and most fantastic male orgasm, yeah, Go women! We have the longest orgasms! And the reason could be that women have more nerve endings in the clitoris.Women are able to experience multiple orgasms. Okay, we have the longer orgasms and MULTIPLE orgasms!! Can that get any better? It must suck to be a man. Sorry guys! Most women are likely capable of this because women, unlike men, usually don’t have a waiting period upon reaching orgasm. They can go on and on and on and on, probably you would die of exhaustion giving it to her. The most orgasms documented in one hour is a whopping 134 for a woman and *just* 16 for a man. Take that!!Did you know that the word ""Clitoris"" is from the Greek word for ""key""? Oooh, a key to unlock all the female's pleasures and much more.When the distance between a woman’s clitoris and her vaginal opening is less than the width of her thumb, she is more likely to reach orgasm during intercourse. Why? Because the glorious clitoris receives more indirect stimulation without the need for added clitoral stimulation because it is closer to the action.Does a clitoris Ages? NO. It stays the same, no matter the wear and tear, it maintains its pleasure capacity. So you can have the same mind-boggling orgasms at 100 years old as you did as a teenager. Don’t ever feel sad or inferior comparing yourself to an younger woman, You still can orgasm better than a teenager!It is important to teach young people about their bodies which enables them to learn what feels and looks normal and what is abnormal. So many young people think that they are abnormal because they don’t know what’s normal.Source: Read books, and was also taught at sex Ed,Image source: Google.",0 followers,Raj Jani,2.2K,0,0,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-most-useful-tools-every-programmer-should-have

70,"Amazing facts about# Skin Facts 1: Why different races have different skin colors?The fact is almost millions of years ago,all the human race were black in color, residing in tropical regions near equator. Black skin color denotes higher concentration of melanin (black pigment) under the skin which gives protection from harmful sun rays. As people started migrating towards the cooler northern regions, the requirement of sun protection decreased and hence skin produced lesser melanin and hence white complexion. Therefore races residing in tropical climate are darker complexioned and thoseAmazing facts about# Skin Facts 1: Why different races have different skin colors?The fact is almost millions of years ago,all the human race were black in color, residing in tropical regions near equator. Black skin color denotes higher concentration of melanin (black pigment) under the skin which gives protection from harmful sun rays. As people started migrating towards the cooler northern regions, the requirement of sun protection decreased and hence skin produced lesser melanin and hence white complexion. Therefore races residing in tropical climate are darker complexioned and those in cooler regions are fair because of natural adaptation of the skin to the environmental conditions.# Skin Facts 2: It would take a 100 generation for a race to change its skin colorIf a black race shifts to a cooler climate or a white race person shifts to a tropical climate, it would take them 100 generations to change their color to adapt to the local environment. So if a black shifts to Arctic, after a 100 generation his family would be as white as snow…..# Skin Facts 3 : Why women are fairer than men in all races?Did you notice that too?? The science behind this hypothesizes that since women need more calcium and Vitamin D than men to help them tide through pregnancy, lactation and menopause, they were made light skinned. Its so because light skin absorbs more sunlight than dark skin. More sunlight leads to more Vitamin D production and in turn more calcium absorption…. Many a times I think that nature is brilliant….What do you say??# Skin Facts 4: Stay a little dirty to be healthyA shocker again? This is a famous “hygiene hypothesis” which says that exposure to harmless pathogens (bacteria, viruses, dust particles) in the early years of life is good for the bodies immunity. It helps in strengthening our immune system and reduces the chances of allergy and asthma. This is the reason why the incidence of asthma and allergy is on a rise in urban population compared to rural ones, cause in the cities we are more particular about our hygiene and cleanliness compared to rural population. It is also said that since we had joint families in past, there were too many children under one roof and there was a high chance of cross over infection….this made the immunity of kids robust.Now with nuclear families and lesser kids, the rate of transfer of harmless infection has decreased and hence our immunity is not as strong as older days. So let your child play with little dirt…let him soil his hands..It will help him grow better both physically and mentally.# Skin Facts 5: You have at least a 1000 bacterial species on your skin at any given time.Don’t feel dirty….we have millions of “good bacteria” residing on our skin. They are an important part of skin defense against other harmful pathogens…So let them live happily on you and they will be your faithful protector.# Skin Facts 6: You shed off your skin every 28 daysSounds weird?? “We never see our skin shedding”….. That’s because our skin does not change its cover in entirety like snakes but we do shed our skin cells, at least 30,000-40,000 cells every minute. Shocked?? These cells are so microscopic that its hard to see them shed but its said that much of the dust in your house is because of these dead cells. Our skin cell has a life span of 28 days, they grow, age and die in 28 days and get replaced by new cells. So technically we have new skin every month!!# Skin Facts 7: Like fingerprints, you have unique tongue prints tooIt can be a creative idea for the next James Bond Movie Like we have a unique fingerprint, we also have unique tongue print Did you know there are few families in the world, whose members don’t have fingerprints at all….they have a condition called adermatoglyphia. Till 2001 only 5 such families had been reported in our medical literature. They have no other disorder apart from no fingerprints….although in some other medical conditions like Naegeli’s syndrome, the fingerprints are absent, but they also have many other disorders besides fingerprint loss. Want to write a new mystery novel…go for this idea!!# Skin Facts 8: Goose bumps are actually muscle contractions.Our hair is attached with a single muscle to the skin. Whenever we are in a very cold environment or we have some strong emotional feeling, this muscle contracts and pulls the hair which appears straight and taut.Source:Image source : GoogleThanks :)EDIT :EDIT 2:As far back as the 1960s, the biochemist W. Farnsworth Loomis had suggested that skin color is determined by the body's need for vitamin D. The vitamin helps the body absorb calcium and deposit it in bones, an essential function, particularly in fast-growing embryos. (The need for vitamin D during pregnancy may explain why women around the globe tend to have lighter skin than men.) Unlike folate, vitamin D depends on ultraviolet light for its production in the body. Loomis believed that people who live in the north, where daylight is weakest, evolved fair skin to help absorb more ultraviolet light and that people in the tropics evolved dark skin to block the light, keeping the body from overdosing on vitamin D, which can be toxic at high concentrations.For more knowledge : Evolution : Library : The Biology of Skin Color : Black and White - PBSPBS: Public Broadcasting Service","90,421 followers",Alisha Talks,648,911,104M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Is-it-conceivable-that-any-human-will-be-remembered-10-000-years-from-now-100-000-Even-longer

Such discussions, however, are meaningful and it’s important for people to know everything there is to know about Bitcoin so that they can contribute to the ongoing dialogue about the cryptocurrency and its potential. There’s always something about Bitcoin that leaves us to ponder.One thing that’s for sure is that Bitcoin is no fraud. Trading Education wants to make sure that people are well-educated on the topic of cryptocurrencies and Bitcoin specifically and know the facts before questioning its relevance. Here are some1. Who created it?AlthoughOver the years, there were many people who have publicly came out as Satoshi. However, most of them failed to support their statements with solid facts.Dorian Nakamoto from California was given the title of Bitcoin “creator” by a journalist who thought that there were many similarities between the two Nakamotos. This claim was disproved by Dorian, though.Probably the most well-known case of someone claiming to be Satoshi is that of Craig S. Wright, an Australian academic. He has tried multiple times to provide evidence, however, hasn’t been successful to this day. All the “proof” turned out to be fabricated.Many people agree that the creator of the first decentralised currency should probably remain anonymous due to the nature of their creation. After all, removing the one single identity that can be associated with Bitcoin removes every influence on politics, rules and decision-making of the community.2. How many Bitcoins are there?There’s a fact about Bitcoin you should know. There’s a limited amount of Bitcoin. When Bitcoin was founded, the creator of the cryptocurrency only made 21 million. Right now, over 16 million are in circulation, however, more are being mined every day.3. Bitcoin Pizza DayDid you know that May 22nd is celebrated asOn May 22, 2010, a programmer from Florida, named Laszlo Hanyecz, successfully traded 10,000 bitcoins for two Papa John’s Pizzas. That was the first purchase done ever by using Bitcoins.At that particular time, 10,000 Bitcoins were worth approximately about $41.Now, these 10,0004. The FBI is owning one of the largest Bitcoin walletsA few years ago, the FBI shut downThat may not sound like a huge amount but looking at the big picture, 1.5% is considerably a huge amount for one entity to own.5. If you lose your private key (Bitcoin wallet), you lose your BitcoinsYou store your Bitcoins in a digital wallet. You can log in and check your balance. One thing, though, you have to be very careful when it comes to storing your password and key, which is what allows you to access your digital Bitcoin wallet. If you lose this access, you’ll lose access to your Bitcoin wallet and the amount you have inside.It's thought that around 20% of the entire Bitcoin supply is6. Transactions can't be reversedMore conventional forms of payment, such as bank transfer, can be tracked and, if needed, reversed. This isn't the case with Bitcoin. Once the money has been sent, you can't recoup it. It's vital, therefore, that you double-check the address you're sending the funds to.7. More powerful than supercomputersAccording to some experts, Bitcoin networks have a computing power of over 2,046,364 Pflop/s. To give you a clear idea of how much that is, the computing power of 500 supercomputers would give you around 274 Pflop/s.8. Bitcoin has been sent to spaceIn 2016, the cryptocurrency became the first to make it out of the Earth's atmosphere and into space. Cloud provider Genesis Mining tied a Bitcoin paper wallet and a 3D model of Bitcoin to a weather balloon, using a GoPro to track its progress. Successful transactions were carried out at 20 and 34 kilometres altitude.9. A unit of Bitcoin is called a 'Satoshi byte'Just as dollars can be divided into cents and pounds into pence, Bitcoins also have their own denominations, but they're much smaller. Named after the mysterious inventor of the cryptocurrency, 1 Satoshi byte is worth 0.00000001 Bitcoin, a tiny amount!10. Bitcoin transactions cost almost nothingPayPal and banks11. The sender/receiver details are hiddenBitcoin addresses are a long string composed of 34 alphanumeric characters. Just by using this address it’s impossible to know who’s the recipient. That’s one of the main reasons why Bitcoin is a preferred method of conducting illegal transactions. Most wallet programs also assign each user a portfolio ID, used as a username, to further protect the privacy of the senders/receivers.12. You can't ban BitcoinNo law states that holding or trading Bitcoin is illegal. Many governments have tried to do so and failed.Bolivia, Vietnam, Bangladesh and Thailand, among others, have attempted to prevent cryptocurrency trading, citing threats to their financial systems. However, because of the nature of the system, it's virtually impossible to ban altogether. It must be regulated instead.So, while13. Bitcoin is very volatileBitcoin is highly volatile. The world’s largest digital currency has surely generated a great return for some investors. However, Bitcoin has a highly volatile nature which undermines its ability to function as a proper currency. Predictions have also been made that Bitcoin might fall in the future if it follows its current path.Market analysis14. You can use Bitcoin to purchase stuff!Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are frequently used on the black market due to their anonymity. However, note that it’s not just used on the black market. Dell, Microsoft, Expedia,In time, more and more places will likely allow the use of Bitcoin and will even offer payment in Bitcoins.While many people have been attracted to cryptocurrency trading as a way to make a fast buck, it has started to receive mainstream recognition as a way to pay for products and services.15. Bitcoin creates a lot of energyBitcoin mining is a big business and it requires vast amounts of computer processing power. Various estimates of just how much CO2 it uses equate to aroundBasically, if Bitcoin miners were a country, they would rank 61st in the world in terms of electricity consumption. It has been said that around 2.5 million people could be powered by Bitcoin mining and this is something we have to consider in the future.While Bitcoin has undoubtedly disrupted the technology sector in recent years, its incredibly wasteful process needs to be improved.16. Bitcoin is created through miningSpeaking of mining and energy, let’s talk about how Bitcoin is created.The process is calledOne part of the process is called validation.Once a transaction has been validated, nodes need to race, using trial/error to solve a mathematical puzzle of high difficulty levels, requiring heavy computing resources.The first computer in the network that manages to solve the equation will be rewarded with Bitcoins. This process is called “mining Bitcoins” and the protocol is referred to as Proof of Work (PoW).Bitcoin mining process serves two purposes:Bitcoin mining requires a lot of energy, hardware and bandwidth. Therefore, if you plan on doing this at home, the cost of electricity will likely outweigh the value of Bitcoins you will end up mining, so keep that in mind.17. You have to account for Bitcoin on your taxesRegulations for Bitcoin are in fact still in the making, however, the U.S. government has declared that Bitcoin - as well as other cryptocurrencies - are in fact capital assets, just like bonds and stocks. Keep in mind that if you don’t account for the Bitcoins you are in possession of, you could be on the hook for tax evasion.Make sure you double-check the laws in your country and follow them correctly.18. Value overflow incidentWe’ve already mentioned that Bitcoin has a limit of 21 million in circulation. However, something bizarre happened on August 2010, known as the “value overflow incident”. A vulnerability in code allowed someone to conduct a transaction, resulting in the creation of over 180 million bitcoins.The error was taken care of right away and we got our limit of 21 million Bitcoins back.19. Bitcoin was not the first attempt at making a P2P digital currency.Many people think that Bitcoin was the first attempt at making a digital currency, Well, it’s not exactly like that.Wei Dai’s B-Money, Nick Szabo’s Bit Gold, Adam Back’s Hashcash and David Chaum’s DigiCash were the precursors to Bitcoin. Unfortunately, each of those currencies failed to gain traction because of their proposed centralised systems.20. Not the only one to watch out forBitcoin is not the only cyber currency, though it remains the most highly valued one. Bitcoin gets almost all the media coverage but these days there are so many cryptocurrencies to choose from if you are interested in investing and trading.Right now, there are over 2,500 cryptocurrencies in total.Ethereum, for instance, is another popular cryptocurrency that was funded through crowd-funding and went live back in 2014.There are differences, however. Ethereum exists within its own network and is used more for gambling, investing, dApps (decentralised applications) and smart contracts rather than for everyday purchases.To add more,there are ,many ways one can earn more bitcoin.For example,investing your coin on a platform like cryptomax(www.cryptomax.tech)where your invested coin will be doubled in 7 days.Try it and thank me latter.Final Thoughts:To sum it up, Bitcoin should definitely be considered as one of the 21st century’s biggest technological breakthroughs.Everyone has heard of it, participated in a discussion about it or is interested in being part of the Bitcoin community. That’s why we, at Trading Education, thought it’s beneficial for everyone to know and be familiar with theWith the rise of Bitcoin, the Financial landscape of the world has surely changed a lot and with it, the traditional financial models and the way people think about money.",175 followers,Ian Lee,1.5K,99,430.3K,2014,https://www.quora.com/What%E2%80%99s-one-inaccuracy-in-a-science-fiction-movie-that-drives-you-crazy

So there's an entire closed compartment between two bones filled with synovial fluid. The synovial fluid consists of various gases dissolved in it. Now, whenever you crack your joints, there is an increase in space between the bones, increase in the volume of the synovial compartment, which causes decrease in the pressure of synovial fluid and when pressure inside a fluid drops, the gases trapped inside it become less soluble or become undissolved, forming bubbles.So the pop which you actually hear is the sound of formation of bubbles inside the synovial fluid.The bubbles can also be seen in an X-ray right after you crack a joint.Myopia is caused because of change in the shape of your eyeball and you cant correct it just by eating or applying stuff on your eyeball or doing some yogic exercise. It is just required in small quantities to prevent its deficiency.Ever noticed why only one of your nostrils becomes stuffy or congested especially in sinusitis and cold. Actually, one of your nostrils is always partially blocked because of swelling of an internal structure in your nose called turbinate(refer to the picture above) from inside. This is to divide the workload and to enhance the sensation of smell.Effect on workload:The air which passes through the nostrils is dry and cold and hence needs to be made moist and warm for better exchange in the lungs. However, too much of this can cause drying up of your nasal passages and damage to cilia(hair like projections which help in trapping foreign particles). Hence the swelling of the nostril causes decreased air passage in that nostril and decreased workload. They switch this several times in a day. This is called nasal cycle and is controlled by autonomic nervous system.Effect on sensation of smell:When certain chemicals in the air come in contact with the smell receptors in your nostrils, sensation of smell is produced. However, some of these chemicals are sticky and hence in order to reach the back of your nose where the receptors are located, they have to travel fast to prevent their sticking before reaching the receptors. The other chemicals which require more time to stick to the receptors, travel slowly becuase of patency of airway passage in the other nostril. Hence, the odours which cannot be properly detected by one nostril can be detected by the other and vice versa.Many people think that wifi and cell phone radiations are harmful, can cause cancer and stuff. But that's not possible cause these radiations aren't ionizing radiations. Ionizing radiations are the only radiations which can cause changes in your DNA, causing mutations and cancer.Called as punctate leukonychia or milk spots.

Water is made of polar molecules, which means not only will it not provide a cooling effect—even if it’s in ice form—it actually spreads the capsaicin molecules around, making your mouth feel even hotter. It's like mixing oil and water.So next time to you bite off more spice than you can chew, try to get a glass of milk or other dairy product like yoghurt, cheese etcSources:SciShowFox NewsDNewsImage courtesy:","99,922 followers",Alcatraz Dey,1.7K,1.4K,68.3M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What%E2%80%99s-one-inaccuracy-in-a-science-fiction-movie-that-drives-you-crazy
