6,"There was a time when physics could explain most of our world’s behavior just fine.For example, we could use Newton’s laws of motion to study both the movement of celestial objects like planets and the trajectories of terrestrial objects like rocks on Earth. But Newton’s laws had a little imperfection when it came to the elliptical orbit of Mercury. It couldn’t quite account for that.Einstein remedied this imperfection with his theory of General Relativity that perfectly described the observed orbit of MercuryThere was a time when physics could explain most of our world’s behavior just fine.For example, we could use Newton’s laws of motion to study both the movement of celestial objects like planets and the trajectories of terrestrial objects like rocks on Earth. But Newton’s laws had a little imperfection when it came to the elliptical orbit of Mercury. It couldn’t quite account for that.Einstein remedied this imperfection with his theory of General Relativity that perfectly described the observed orbit of Mercury, and all other terrestrial and celestial objects for that matter.After it upset the Newtonian worldview of the early 20th century, General Relativity went on a streak of perpetual spot-on predictions that never failed, not once. It predicted the bending of light in the presence of a gravitational well. That prediction was confirmed.It predicted the existence of black holes, a very curious region of spacetime. At first, it was not clear whether this prediction was merely a mathematical artifact of the theory or whether the mathematics actually described something real. Today we know, black holes are real.The theory predicted the existence of gravitational waves which we were only able to confirm experimentally in 2016.But some things no theoretical framework could explain, not Newtonian physics, not special and general relativity, not electrodynamics or thermodynamics. All of physics in the early 20th century was incapable of correctly describing - the things on aGoing down to ever smaller dimensions we eventually come to molecules, to atoms and electrons, and eventually to quarks which had to be discovered later. Those small “objects” behave very strangely, physicists thought. Very strangely indeed. They wouldn’t adhere to the laws we had for big objects like rocks and planets.So, either we need to adjust the theory that we have, which is general relativity, or we think of a new theory that describes this weird behavior of the very small. Changing general relativity to accommodate the very small didn’t work. What did work was describing the strange behavior of small things in an equally strange manner.But hold on, what is this strange behavior?Right, well. On a macroscopic scale it’s possible to predict a future configuration of a system if we know the previous configuration. For example, knowing the position of a planet allows us to predict a future position of the planet because we know how to calculate its movement. That does not work for microscopically small things.If you have a particle of light, which is called a photon, you cannot be certain that it’s going to go this way or that way, that it’s going to land here or there. One time the photon lands here when we fire it, another time it lands there when we fire it. But we didn’t do anything different! How are we ever going to make accurate predictions if we can’t properly predict anything?Enter quantum physics.The word “quantum” may be daunting, but it merely describes that all small things come in “chunks”. Light, for example, is not a continuous thing where it’s difficult to say how much of it is there. Rather it’s divided into chunks or packets orNow we could count those tiny things we’re dealing with. But we still couldn’t say how they would behave given an initial configuration. Instead we discovered that we could predict theAnd after observing where photons landed the experimental results precisely matched the predicted probabilities! The mechanics of the quantum world is bizarre, but at least we had a working theory that accurately described this quantum mechanics.To give you a more concrete example of the bizarre behavior, think of light reflecting off a sheet of glass. Have you ever wondered how much of light gets reflected?We’ve already said that we can’t predict if a single photon is reflected or not, but we can predict that of a hundred photons, say, two photons will be reflected on average.So, 2% of all photons reflect back from the surface of the glass. All right then.Is itNow, 4% of all photons reflect! Mhh, all right, you say. Let’s take an even thicker sheet of glass.16%. Aha, the thicker the glass the more photons are reflected! Let’s take an even thicker glass!8%. Erm, that’s odd. What happened there?You check and take ever thicker sheets of glass and observe its reflections. And for ever thicker sheets of glass you realize that the reflection goes back to 0% and then back up to 16% and then back to 0%. It circles through 0% to 16%.At this point you wonder, how is it possible that the light “knows” when to reflect? All I’m doing is increasing the thickness. Is it reflecting off the front surface and the back surface? But how does it know not to reflect off the surface if it hadn’t reached the back surface, yet? How does it decide not to reflect at all?The answer lies in drawing little arrows.Really.We’ve established that we can calculate the probability of an event, something like “what is the probability of light reflecting off this glass”? Let’s calculate then!In order to calculate our probabiliy we draw arrows.Imagine an analog clock that is counting the time of a photon that starts its journey from the source (a laser) to the glass where it reflects off the front surface and then hits a detector that registers it. Keep the hands of that clock turning as long as the photon travels and then stops once it hits the detector.Now we have a direction given by the watch hand and what we do then is draw this watch hand as an arrow. Its length is the square root of its experimental probability to reflect and in this case let’s say the reflection is 4%, so the length would be 0.2 becauseLet’s do the same for the back surface. We keep the hand watch turning as the photon leaves the source, reflects off theBefore we put these two arrows together there’s one little detail we need to know. Arrows that reflect off the front surface are reversed in their direction. That’s it.Now we place the second arrow’s tail onto the first arrow’s head (which we previously reversed). And then we draw another arrow, the so-calledWe just calculated the probability of photons reflecting off the glass.See figure 13 in the picture below as reference for where the hands point and how we draw the arrows.If we increased the thickness of the glass (figure 14) then the hand of the photons reflecting off the back surface would take a little longer to arrive at the detector. The result is an arrow pointing in the same direction as the first arrow. Add them together head to tail, draw the final arrow, and you getSquare those 0.4 and you getThis business of observing how light behaves is referred to as quantum electrodynamics, or QED for short, a way of looking at light at the smallest scale.But what does all this, the photons, the glass, and the reflections, have to do withNothing at all.But it works.Welcome to quantum physics.",2 followers,Richard Muller,2.2K,2.3K,202.3M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-best-technology-that-emerged-out-of-quantum-physics

Essentially, this equationWhat this equation describes, in the words of Wheeler, is this: Spacetime tells matter how to move; matter tells spacetime how to curve.But look closely. ThatIt has a hat because it is a quantum-mechanical operator. Because we know that matter consists of quantum fields. So it is described by operator-valued quantities (Dirac called them q-numbers). They are unlike ordinary numbers. For instance, when you multiply them, the order in which they appear matters. That is, when you have two operatorsWhen Einstein wrote down his field equation over 100 years ago, theBut there are no hats on the left-hand side. And because of that, my equation might as well say something like, some apples = some oranges. It makes no sense. The stuff on the left-hand side (which consists of numbers) can never equal the stuff on the right-hand side (which definitely does not consist of numbers.)I can make it work, though. I can replace that operator with its so-called expectation value:RThis is called semiclassical gravity. And it works well, very well indeed. A little too well, as a matter of fact. Gravity is so weak, quantum effects are so irrelevant, this equation accurately describes Nature everywhere we can look. But we still don’t like it, because using that expectation value trick is a cheat, a cop-out.Now you might wonder, why don’t I put hats on top of the things on the left-hand side? I would… if I knew how to quantize spacetime. That is, how to turn the numbers that describe gravity into quantum-mechanical operators.But I do not. And nobody does. The standard methods all fail, leading to equations that make no sense at all.So we are kind of stuck… we don’t know how to quantize gravity, and our observations don’t help us, don’t offer any hints as to how to get beyond semiclassical gravity.

From solar trees to self-repairing roads, these inventions have the potential to dramatically impact the way people live.1. SuryaGen Solar Water PurifierDeveloped by IISc. researchers and Suryagen Renewables, this open source solar water purifier can transform water from any source – be it from sea, river, pond, wells, or even water collected from rain – into potable water. The low-cost device can also provide clear drinking water in areas where the only sources are contaminated with arsenic, fluoride or sewage.In this device, impure water is evaporated using solar energy and the vapours are condensed to pure water on a cold surface. This leaves behind bacteria, heavy metals, arsenic, fluoride and other impurities. It can effectively produce 1.5 litres of potable water from 3 litres of impure water daily.2. Envigreen Edible BagsIndia has been moving away from plastics for many years and many cities have already issued plastic bag bans. While legislation like this helps to protect our environment and wildlife, a young entrepreneur, Ashwath Hegde, noticed that it was a hardship for many Indians.He eventually landed on a combination of natural starch (from potato and tapioca) and vegetable oils to make a bag that looks and feels just like plastic with none of the negative environmental impacts of a plastic vessel. Envi's Green bags will naturally degrade in 180 days and if they are submerged in water they disappear in a day. Oh and also – these bags are edible. This means that when animals encounter non-degraded bags, they can eat them with no adverse effects.3. Self-Repairing RoadsNemkumar Bhantia, a professor in the Civil Engineering Department at University of British Columbia (UBC) in the Canada, has developed roads that are self-repairing and sustainable. Built used ultra high-strength concrete and special fibres developed at UBC, the first such road in Karnataka is not only cost-effective, but has greater longevity.Unlike the typical concrete road, in which cement is a key component, Banthia’s self-repairing road uses 60 % fly-ash and only 40 % cement. The fibres used have a hydrophilic nano-coating, which attract water in the event of rains. The water then becomes a key component in healing cracks. When a crack appears, this water gives hydration capability to the un-hydrated cement, and produces more silicates, which actually close the crack before they grow larger.4.

Modern prostheses, while flexible, are made of material like carbon-fibre and Kevlar that make them far too expensive for most amputees in India.Brainchild of Arun Cherian, a roboticist and engineer, who noticed how cane furniture was made by bending the stem in such beautiful shapes that could also hold human weight. Impressed by the pliability, strength and spring-like quality of the cane, Cherian had one question – Can you make a leg out of cane?

With photovoltaic panels placed at different levels on branches made of steel, “solar trees” could dramatically reduce the amount of land needed to develop solar parks.Solar power trees are also capable of harnessing 10 to 15 percent more power compared to ground-mounted solar arrays. The tree charges a battery backup system that can provide two hours of light after sunset on a full charge. The solar tree is also self-cleaning, with a built-in water sprinkler to clear any debris that would interfere with efficiency.9. DewDrop Water-from-Air CondenserJawwad Patel , a 22-year-old engineering student from Hyderabad has designed a 3D-printed apparatus which can ‘create’ water from air. He is the first person from Asia to do so. The water apparatus produces pure drinkable water with the the help of computerised sensor interface with UV filter. In an hour, the device can extract nearly 1.8 litres of water from air.Called ‘Dewdrop’, this device uses the moisture in the air to create the water. It is also not Patel’s first attempt at creating a novel device. He has previously created a smart helmet, which will not let you drive if you are drunk. He has also been nominated for the National Youth Award 2015-16 and Dr APJ Abdul Kalam Excellence Award 2016.10. Unique Waste Disposal BinsGanga Narayan Ghosh, an 87-year-old mechanical engineer, has designed some innovative waste disposal bins to tackle the problem of waste management in India in an organised way. He visited 192 cities in India and 80 cities of six continents to explore other systems and finally designed three unique bins – one for homes, another for housing complexes and schools and the largest one for markets and entire localities.Every bin is covered, which prevents birds and animals from grabbing the waste content inside. Each bin is elevated so the bottom does not get submerged in water and is not corroded. The third and perhaps most unique feature is that the bottom portion of every bin is sloping. The slope creates an ‘angle of slide’ that helps in emptying waste once the front hatch is opened. The garbage automatically comes out of the opening due to gravity.Specially designed handcarts or regular open-top trucks can be strategically placed in front of the bins to collect waste. This is a huge relief for garbage handlers as they hardly have to touch anything. Even the top surface of each bin is has a slope so rain water cannot accumulate and corrode it. People also cannot leave bags of trash on it.","14,230 followers",Saran Udayakumar,2.3K,1K,29.3M,2013,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-best-technology-that-emerged-out-of-quantum-physics
