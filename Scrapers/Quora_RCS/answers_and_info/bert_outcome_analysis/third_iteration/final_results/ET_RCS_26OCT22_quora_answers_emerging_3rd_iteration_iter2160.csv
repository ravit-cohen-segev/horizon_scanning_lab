Operating systems were evolving quickly as well, from Windows 3.1 to 95 to 98 and so on.Today, rather than revolutionary advances in tech, the changes seem to be more evolutionary.

Ten years ago, in 2008, one of the top gadgets was the Apple iPod Touch - basically an iPhone that could play music but couldn’t make calls. The iPhone had been introduced the year before, but hadn’t gained much traction yet, so another popular toy was the Flip camcorder. Today, smartphones shoot video and play music, rendering the older tech obsolete.That’s probably what will happen in the coming decade: a breakthrough like the smartphone will turn the tech world upside down again. Failing that, there’ll just be incremental process that will make the tech of 2028 look a lot like what we have now, only faster and - hopefully - cheaper.","246,825 followers",Dushka Zapata,2.9K,8.5K,232.3M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-lists-of-innovative-technology-will-change-the-automative-industry-in-upcoming-5-10-years

4,"Automation has nothing to do with the improvement of ‘innovation’. On the flip side, of course innovation can improve automation. Innovation is a creative process, Thinking up new ways of doing older things, or creating new things themselves. Automation is the process of standardizing and improving the flow of production. The idea that perhaps AI can increase innovation is probably not valid. AI may be a possible source of integrating existing ideas, but if you mean radical NEW concepts that may be some while yet. We don’t know if it’s possible to automate true creativity.","75,027 followers",Neman Ashraf,4.5K,410,37M,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-lists-of-innovative-technology-will-change-the-automative-industry-in-upcoming-5-10-years

In addition, wireless technology enables faster data transfer speeds.But the third aspect is perhaps the most important one for the meaningful use of the Internet of Things: 5G gives us the opportunity to connect many more devices at the same time. This is exactly what is so immensely important for the many sensors and intelligent devices that revolutionize our everyday lives so massively. No quantum leaps in medical care, no fully equipped Smart Homes, no autonomous driving cars and no extension of Predictive Maintenance without the super fast connections.No autonomous cars without 5GThe mentioned smart renewals are still partly on the rise. This is how the Connected Car is developing into a convincing companion on the congested streets of this world. As with its smart colleagues, the Internet of Things will make automation easier in other areas as well in 2019. This is how sensors check the functionality. If something is wrong, the workshop date will be made.Thanks to the voice assistants it is easier to control the air conditioning and similar without leaving your hands off the steering wheel. In combination with the Smart City, our car automatically manages to avoid congestion and find a free parking space. If the sensors detect a deterioration in our health, the ambulance is notified. The connected cars will soon be driving autonomously, which is why they are equipped with even more sensors and smart technology.But it does not work without fast data connections and high connectivity.Hope it helps,OKportal Technology","284,845 followers",James Altucher,991,878,91.7M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-lists-of-innovative-technology-will-change-the-automative-industry-in-upcoming-5-10-years
7,"Clean coal technology (CCT) decreases severe environmental impact by utilizing various technologies for the efficient combustion of coal with reduced emissions of nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide. Clean coal technology is highly efficient, cost-effective, and environmentally compatible technologies for steel mills, cement plants, electric utilities, and other industries. The majority of the countries such as the U.S., China, Brazil are adopting CCT mainly because of the growing emphasis on future energy supplies, environmental effects, and volatility in energy prices. Moreover, clean coal isClean coal technology (CCT) decreases severe environmental impact by utilizing various technologies for the efficient combustion of coal with reduced emissions of nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide. Clean coal technology is highly efficient, cost-effective, and environmentally compatible technologies for steel mills, cement plants, electric utilities, and other industries. The majority of the countries such as the U.S., China, Brazil are adopting CCT mainly because of the growing emphasis on future energy supplies, environmental effects, and volatility in energy prices. Moreover, clean coal is identified as a popular and significant fuel choice in overall energy policy mainly because of the huge availability of reserves worldwide, along with it is among the most economical of energy resources. Moreover, as per the newsletter of Clean Coal Technologies, Inc. coal remains a crucial energy source the globe along with the demand is increasing rapidly in multiple countries. Further, it states that the demand for clean coal will reach up to 700 million tones in the period between the year 2000-2050.In addition, rapid urbanization along with ever-growing energy demand in the developed as well as developing countries may lead to an increase in the need for clean coal technologies, globally. The key factors of clean coal technologies consist of flue-gas desulfurization, carbon capture & storage, low nitrogen oxide burners, integrated gasification combined cycle, electrostatic precipitators, and selective catalytic reduction. The Above-stated elements may lead to upsurge the global clean coal technology market worldwide. Furthermore, increasing concerns regarding environmental emission reduction technologies from coal power plants are also predicted to rise the adoption of CCT in multiple industries across the globe which will eventually boost the growth of the global market.Furthermore, the majority of supportive government regulations & policies as well as global environmental agency recommendations are encouraging leading manufacturers of clean coal technology to invest in R&D for technological development. Furthermore, many industry players across the world are implementing effective strategies to strengthen the footprint into the global market, which will eventually bolster the market growth.",3 followers,Steve Baker,860,27.4K,163.2M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-lists-of-innovative-technology-will-change-the-automative-industry-in-upcoming-5-10-years
