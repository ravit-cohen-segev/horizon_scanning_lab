The war drags on for an eternity, and victory comes at an agonising pace. Meanwhile, we endure betrayals; we hide; we run and flee; we raid and ambush and skin and flay and kill; we loot our own dead; we drink the blood of our enemies; and suffer the endless tide of fratricide. I killed my own mother without knowing her face. I have killed nineteen of my own brothers in the last century alone, almost always in idiotic battles for possession of this sword, or over matters of bruised pride. I have no wish to unite the Legion. I hate the Legion. Not for what it is, but for what it made me become.’Variel still said nothing. Rather than seeming lost for words, he simply seemed to lack any desire to speak at all.‘There’s one thing I want,’ said Talos. ‘I want that alien witch’s head. I want to plant it on her spear at the heart of these ruins.’ Talos turned away from the gunship, walking away. ‘And I mean to have it. Stay in the air, Variel. Land once it’s over. Whether I live or die this night, you are welcome to my gene-seed come the dawn.’Cyrion left the ramp, following Talos. ‘I’m coming with you.’ Lucoryphus’s head jerked with a muscle tic in his neck.He briefly rose to his clawed feet, and stalked after the others. ‘I will join you. One more dead eldar will bring the Bleeding Eyes to two score.

None of them that are canon are female. And if, somehow, a female neophyte of the Astartes were brought into an all-male chapter, and were in any way compatible with the geneseed (remember, every surgery and modification has a more-than-modern chance of failing and outright killing the neophyte), think of what the geneseed, which is designed to make the neophyte resemble the Primarch it’s descended from, would do to her body.Hint: They wouldn’t be a female Astartes by the end of the process.Now, there’s one way you COULD play a female chapter of Space Marines if you’re willing to kitbash.There are two missing Primarchs that are there so you can paint your own chapter and mak...",0 followers,Jesse Sinclair,762,93,601.9K,2020,https://www.quora.com/Why-is-there-such-a-push-to-get-female-Space-Marines-Is-it-logical-when-there-are-elite-female-factions-in-40k

When GW did start adding “bewbs” to their minis they were usually for less popular alien factions and many were initially little more than purile T&A to give the 13-year olds a thrill.Eventually, GW introduced their first “serious” female warriors - the Sisters of Battle. But even after the introduction of the first Sisters of Battle miniatures there were people who wanted “real” female SMs.The impression of many people were that the SOB got short-changed. They were described in the fluff as elite women warriors nearly (but not) the equal of the SM chapters and their minis certainly looked cool but most of the players who played them found them to be pretty underwhelming on the table. I never played them, myself, so I could only take their word for it. I did play against them a couple of times and I don’t recall them being an especially tough fight for my Smurfs. (Cut me some slack - I was young and hadn’t discovered ‘nids yet.)Anyway, the SOB never really got the sales that GW wanted so they started tweaking the formula to try to pump up business. They merged the SOB into what was basically an “Inquisition” army but this only served to further dilute the flavor of the army by adding recycled IG storm troopers and male hero units while simultaneously failing to make them competitive. Sales didn’t improve and the line languished for a loong time with no new models and little support. For a long time, the SOB were only available as metal models from the online store - so basically special orders and were priced accordingly.Relatively recently, GW has revised the line to new interest, added new models and support products to drum up interest. This is a purely business driven action. GW finally recognized that there were actual female players who had an interest in a seeing something of themselves in their armies. Side Note 1: Psychological studies show us that most people seek to invest themselves into their fictional media. Many male players consciously or unconsciously project their own self image into their armies in one fashion or another. There are female players that want the same opportunity with their armies.But that still doesn’t address the issue for many people. The SMs are theWhile the SOB certainly are described as “elite” and they are female - they are not as “elite” as the SM who are exclusively male. So, the people seeking gender parity still feel short-changed.For my part, I don’t see what the big deal is for so many players. Why not have female SMs? Who really cares? It is more potential minis to collect and paint. It is more potential players to bring into the hobby. It is more acceptance in mainstream markets where all the real money is - so GW can be more profitable and produce more new stuff. If you don’t like female SMs don’t collect them. Buy some other minis instead. Why is it so important to rain on someone else’s fun?And don’t try that “It’s not canon!” BS with me. Sure, the canon says women can’t be Space Marines. But it also once said that no one could improve upon the Emperor’s Space Marine designs either. Look how that turned out. The ‘Nids used to have slave races that served them. Those races aren’t canon any more but they once were - GW even made minis for them. The canon is whatever GW says it is so if they wanted to add female SMs to the mix they could certainly do it. A bunch of neck-beards will throw tantrums online - just like they did with Primaris Marines. But if GW makes the female SMs competitive at the table you can bet those same neck-beards will quickly get over it - just like they did with the Primaris Marines.",539 followers,Papa Shadow,557,174,4.9M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Why-is-there-such-a-push-to-get-female-Space-Marines-Is-it-logical-when-there-are-elite-female-factions-in-40k

Most programmers today have little knowledge of how a processor actually works and so many misconceptions creep in. For instance, many Answers you see on this question deal with memory addressing and this is definitely not what is meant by a 32 or 64 bit chip. Let me give you just a little insight.You probably know that back in the day, there were 8 bit computers. Since bits are binary or one bit can contain two states (the on or off you hear about), multiple bits can contain 2 to the power of how many there are. So 8 bits of information is 2 to the power of 8 or 256. Obviously, 8 bit computers could access more than 256 bits of memory. Many could access 64 kilobytes of memory. This leads us to a split in what bits mean in a computer.Processors use bits in two different ways. First there is data. That's the information that the processor is recieving. Then there are address bits. These bits are how a processor tells memory where the information is stored. These are typically seperate pins on a processor. An 8 bit chip may have 16 address pins to access 64k of memory but when that data comes in, its on 8 pins of the separate data bus. (In some old slow processors these were multiplexed remember I'm trying to keep it simple though). In the chip are what is called registers. These are little bins that the processor keeps the data that is currently being working on. Not cache, just a handful of bytes. These registers are usually the size of the ‘bits’ the processor is. An 8 bit processor has registers eight bits wide, 64 bit processors have 64 bit wide registers. for the most part this is true but there are exceptions.An 8 bit processor will have two registers together to make one 16 bit address register. 2 to the power of 16 is 64k bytes. This is how a processor like the 8080 or 8085 works.The 8086 is a 16 bit processor and the registers are 16 bits wide. However, that processor has 20 bits of addressing and can access 1MB. It also has 16 data pins. The 8088 only had 8 data pins but 16 bit registers. So it has to wait two clocks to fill the registers. That's why it was cheaper. These ran on dos and dos based windows. This was known as a 16 bit operating system but can access much more than 64 kb of memory. In fact, the hard limit for windows 3.11 memory is 4Gb. These used a page system. Another register would be a pointer register to address a 64kb page of memory that was called by the 16 bit address register. So, clearly the limiting impediment to memory is the operating system and the features of the processor and not the inherent 'bitness’. 32 bit processors could access more than 4GB if Intel wanted to put in a pointer register or just widen the address register. However, the so called ‘flat memory model’ is easier to work with and probably faster.Current 64 bit processors use 40 bit (only twice the lines of a 8086) addressing which can address 1 terabyte not 64 bits which is ….. Alot… about 16 exabytes. Why make manufacturing the processor more difficult than necessary by adding pins for addressing that the end user is never going to use? The option is there however and as our memory requirements increase, future processors can add more address pins within the 64 bit framework.Microsoft started supporting 32 bit functions in windows with the win32s extension of windows 3.1 in 1992. OS/2 also supported 32 bits earlier that same year.When the Pentium processor came out in 1993 they toyed with calling it 64 bits because it was superscaler and could issue 2 32 bit instructions at the same time.Later in 1997, mmx technology was developed and added 64 bit MMX registers to the Pentium.Then in 1999 the SSE instruction set was released with the pentium 3. This was a 128 bit instruction set. Now this was what is commonly referred to a a 32 bit chip capable of doing 128 bit operations.Intel released the 64 bit itanium processor in 2001.AVX instructions and registers were introduced in 2011 with the Sandy bridge architecture. This is a 256 bit system. AVX 512 is a 512 bit system showing up on knights landing from 2016.Today's dual channel memory can transfer 128 bits to and from memory and there are also some quad channel systems.You can see that it is a complicated situation. In order for today's processors to make the most of their transistor budget, parts are high bit where they need to be and low bit where they don't need to be any higher. The truth is, 64 bits is a truly massive amount of bits for many applications such as most common math and addressing. There is just no need for 128 bits or higher most of the time. Maybe someday but the same argument between 32 and 64 bit happened in the early 2000s.When the operating system states its for 64 bit processors, it is requiring a certain minimum processor functionality to work with the os. other programs may take advantage of other processor functions beyond what is required by the os.Edit: I am adding another type of computer in order to answer a comment. I think more people will see it here. I did not want to bring this one up because it’s a difficult concept but consider this bonus material.Most of the processers we think of these days are of the Von Neuman type and this does tend to align memory addressing with the “bitness” - not all the time as shown above but most. There is another type of major architecture called the Harvard Architecture. In this type of computer, word width, timing, implementation technology, and memory access structure can all be different. Many times, the instruction bus and memory is totally decoupled from the data bus and memory and can be any size and can be accessed at the same time. Sometimes it can even be partitioned by the programmer.For instance… in a normal Von Neuman design, one instruction codes for one operation, but the Intel Itanium implementation utilizes what’s called VLIW or a very long instruction word. This is a 128 bit instruction “bundle” which pulls in three 41 bit instructions (or “syllables” of the “word”) and 5 template bits which define how those syllables relate (or not) to each other.With a Von Neuman parallel processor, there are two identical processing units and there is a hardware layer that searches for the proper instructions to execute and then issues them to the execution cores. In the Harvard system, the instruction has the parallelism built in (Explicit Parallel Instruction Computing or EPIC). The instruction can include for example both a floating point multiply and and add instruction at the same time. However, in order to work properly, the code is almost always compiled rather than hand assembled because it is so complicated and exact. In this way, the processor can be much less complicated because it doesn’t have to predict fetches and allocate issues on the fly. All the hard work is done by the complier. This can be much faster for limited circuit complexity.Another example is the Super Harvard Architecture Single Chip Computer uses a 48 bit word instruction, 32 bit word for integers and floating point numbers and 40 bits for extended floating point numbers.This type of architecture is not obscure. It is very suited for digital signal processing uses. A lot of computers these days are some sort of hybrid designs between Harvard and Von Neuman (also known as Princeton) architectures. For instance, most level 1 cache these days are separated between instruction space and data space.Again, this is a more extreme example of how the size of the memory addressing doesn’t represent the bitness of the processor. There can be many different types of architecture if we wanted to produce them that could be incredibly diverse however, its easier to focus study and design on just two types unless we can prove something new is more efficient.","220,646 followers",Franklin Veaux,8K,47.3K,783.2M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Why-is-there-such-a-push-to-get-female-Space-Marines-Is-it-logical-when-there-are-elite-female-factions-in-40k

With current computers a cache miss has the equivalent penalty to doing a floating point operation. If we needed to deal with the larger number than 64 bit could handle. If you say the answer is increase the cache size and then the 128 bit will be faster, but the same size cache used on a 64 bit system will cause it to be faster.All modern CPU and support chips or device controllers like Network, Disk, graphics processors, have the ability to move around large chunks of memory or it can be done using memory management unit which just make the data move instantaneously without moving actual data, so the fact that a 128 bit CPU can move twice as much data in a single cycle really doesn’t come into play because the system handles it in the background. with out using any CPU resources.","220,646 followers",Franklin Veaux,717,47.3K,783.2M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Why-is-there-such-a-push-to-get-female-Space-Marines-Is-it-logical-when-there-are-elite-female-factions-in-40k
15,"I take issue with most of the answers here. The question was not, and is not: “Will computers ever have so much memory that we need 128 bit addressing to address it all?” That’s the question I see most people answering. 128 bit computing does not mean storage requiring 128 bits to address it all.In the 1970’s, IBM’s Rochester, MN lab developed the IBM System/38. The processor used 48 bit addressing. The original models maxed out at 1536K bytes of main storage at the time. (Why did they doI take issue with most of the answers here. The question was not, and is not: “Will computers ever have so much memory that we need 128 bit addressing to address it all?” That’s the question I see most people answering. 128 bit computing does not mean storage requiring 128 bits to address it all.In the 1970’s, IBM’s Rochester, MN lab developed the IBM System/38. The processor used 48 bit addressing. The original models maxed out at 1536K bytes of main storage at the time. (Why did they do this? Because addresses were used as the fundamental way of identifying data in a persistent way. Contrast that to Unix/Linux/Windows, where the fundamental way of identifying data is with a hierachical named path, combined with a 32-bit or (more commonly now) 64-bit offset into a stream file found at the path. The Unix/Linux names are not unique, as multiple hard links can be established to the same file. The Unix/Linux names are scoped to a particular machine, (actually a single file system on a logical device) and if you want to extend the naming to multiple machines, you need other disparate addressing techniques. So to write the address of one byte of persistent storage residing on one of a related collection of machines/file systems,you need a multi-part address — Identify the machine, the device, the path to a file within the device file system, and the byte offset within the file. (The first three can be combined into a path, with mounting and symbolic links and such, but this makes for even more non-unique ways to get to the same byte.)On the System/38 (and through all of its follow on successors up to IBM i running on IBM Power hardware) the single address (which is now 64 bits) can be used to uniquely identify a specific byte from the time that byte (or the segment containing that and many other bytes) comes into existence until it is destroyed. The user friendly name is mapped over the address, rather than mapping an address over a name (like mmap does).Part of the 64 bit address space is reserved for ‘temporary’ storage that is locally used on a single logical partition, and whose storage only survives until the machine is re-booted. However, these temporary addresses are not re-used (unless specifically permitted by the owner) so an address to this temporary storage can be tucked away in a persistent storage object and after a re-boot the temporary address is guaranteed to ‘segment fault’ if used— it won’t address some random new piece of storage.Other parts of the 64 bit address space are use for persistent storage scoped to a logical partition. This storage persists at the given address until explicitly deleted. Such objects can easily exist for years or even decades, surviving re-boots, OS upgrades, hardware upgrades, complete disk replacements, and so forth.Finally, a portion of the 64 bit address space is reserved for Independant Auxillary Storage Pools or iASPs. These addresses are unique across a cluster of machines, and the storage units holding the data or just the data itself can be moved from one machine to another in a wide variety of ways, and continue to be addressed by its one unique address throughout its lifetime.As if that wasn’t enough, way back in the System/38 days, the architects actually allocated 128 bits for pointers. Although some of these bits are used for non-addressing functions, there is room to grow beyond the 64 bits.Of course in all of this, these 48 bit addresses and now 64 bit addresses are DIRECTLY usable in processor load and store instructions (with a suitable page fault handler, of course)In more recent embodiments, there is also the ability to have an entirely separate 64 bit address space, which is primarily used for process local storage (prior to this the temporary range of the ‘regular’ 64 bit address space was used.) The addresses are self identifying as to which 64 bit address space they are associated with.I could easily see a day where 128 bit addressing is used and all storage among all machines EVERYWHERE of such an architecture are entirely unique and never used twice anywhere.We don’t need to wait until we have gobs of physical storage to have a legitimate use for 128 bit addressing.","1,136 followers",Wim ten Brink,2.2K,2.2K,5.9M,2016,https://www.quora.com/Why-is-there-such-a-push-to-get-female-Space-Marines-Is-it-logical-when-there-are-elite-female-factions-in-40k

If you have a 512-bit memory bus clocked at 10 GHz (an order of magnitude faster than anything in common use today) you have 640 GB/s of bandwidth. If you have 2^64 bytes of RAM on this system it will take you on the order of 10^7 seconds (115 days) just to read or write each memory location ONCE. Even after another order-of-magnitude speedup we're looking at 11.5 days.With a distributed memory system, on the other hand, you have a separate memory bus for each node. RPI's 5-rack BlueGene/Q, for example, has 5,120 compute nodes with 16GB of DDR3 per node for a total of 81.92 TB of RAM. Assuming a 64-bit memory bus at 1866 MT/s for the sake of discussion, we have 14.928 GB/s of bandwidth per node, and 74.64 TB/s of bandwidth for the whole system - enough to read or write the sum total of all RAM in a bit over a second.In short, while we may one day see systems with well over 2^64 bytes of total memory, to make this memory useful it will need to be split among enough individual processors that no single processor will need an address bus more than 64 bits in size.",UNKNOWN,Viktor T.

There are two kinds of memory in the computer world: volatile and nonvolatile. Volatile memory (RAM) is WAY faster than nonvolatile memory, but if it isn't fed a constant voltage the memory will be lost. Nonvolatile memory (hard disks, flash drives, etc.) only needs power if you want to access or change the data.When you open a file, the file's data is sent from the nonvolatile memory to the volatile memory.TLDR: You can't do it unless you really know what you're doing.

Volatile memory (RAM) is WAY faster than nonvolatile memory, but if it isn't fed a constant voltage the memory will be lost. Nonvolatile memory (hard disks, flash drives, etc.) only needs power if you want to access or change the data.When you open a file, the file's data is sent from the nonvolatile memory to the volatile memory. When you make changes to the file, you're only altering what it looks like in the volatile memory. When you save the file, the nonvolatile memory is updated so the volatile and nonvolatile memory match. When you shut down your computer, your operating system saves a bunch of data to the nonvolatile memory, then tells the BIOS to stop sending voltage/power to the computer. If you only had volatile memory, you'd lose EVERYTHING when that happened: OS, programs, files, everything.There are a couple workarounds to this dilemma, but none of them are great. The most expensive option is NVRAM, which is basically nonvolatile memory that is so fast the OS can treat it like regular volatile memory. This is cutting edge tech, so there are a lot of problems with it that you'll have to work around, even beyond the price tag. Another option is to change what you boot from. It's technically possible (but unbearably slow in practice) to boot your computer from a USB drive or network drive instead of the normal hard disk. One big problem with this is that if the connection is broken, you’re in trouble. How much trouble you’re in depends on a lot of things, but the most pertinent one is paging. Modern OS’s will recognize when they’re running out of RAM for all the things you have open, and when that happens the OS effectively treats a portion of the hard disk like it’s RAM. If you disconnect the hard disk when it is paged and the OS tries to access that missing data, the system will probably crash.With all these problems, the big question I have isOn a side note, I believe the speed of your hard disk is one of the most underrated performance factors in a computer. Gamers and graphic designers require a decent GPU and computer scientists generally need lots of RAM and a good CPU, but for basic tasks people are generally limited by hard disk speed. Upgrade to an SSD and you’ll boot faster, applications and documents will load faster and installs will finish faster. Apple figured this out early, and it’s a big reason that the original Macbook Air (and almost all of their flagship laptops since then) had a fast SSD rather than a top-of-the-line CPU or GPU.Hope this helps,Edit: just realized you might be asking a different question.

I stood in my corner watching, because everyone was quiet, so the noise was not forcing me to remain rigid. It finally got to me, I walked out, solved every puzzle in the middle of the room, and then walked back to my corner. When commissioners tried to congratulate me, I cringed away. I did not do it for the praise, I did it because my mind solved it and it was irritating to me that it remained unsolved in the room. It did not change my status with the kids or teachers. When called upon to answer, I froze overwhelmed. I was punished for tantrums all my life, so my reaction became deer in the headlights. I was friendless. But my mom fought for me to be in normal school and I passed all aptitude tests. So clearly not stupid. I was not toilet trained until 8, mostly because a daycare teacher refused to let me go when I needed to, so I was sort of trained to have accidents. All the neurotypical kids could go when she told them to go. I could only go when I had to.The few kids who tried to be friends discovered that I can only be friends one on one. More than one friend overwhelmed me and I would start biting. I had no idea what personal space was, my mom solved that by making me wear a hula hoop around me. If I bumped into people with a hula hoop, then I was too close. It became an unbreakable rule in my head. I could not read people’s faces. I had no idea if people were sneering at me, laughing at me, or simply smiling. Same with tone of voice. I solved that by seeking out medical/psychology books in the library that explained it all. To this day, I am phenomenal at “textbook” facial expressions and intonations. But people who deliver stories and jokes in a deadpan voice confuse me.I was obsessed with dogs and dog facts. Eventually I got a Great Dane puppy, and I spent a ton of time training her. She was my guardian, but also my ice breaker. People would ask questions about her, and I was a fountain of facts.Moving to the US at age 13 was like mass therapy (yes, we brought the Great Dane). I did not speak the language or know the customs. And for the first time in my life, the excuse was that I was foreign. And Americans all obliged. “No, say it this way!”, “No, in these situations people do this!”, “When this happens, the customary response is this!” It was incredible. I went through high school being the weird foreigner. But I absorbed every direction and correction like a sponge. Teachers did not call on me, because English was tough for me and I froze. Little did they know I froze for other reasons, but it helped. I can pass any paper test. So there was no doubt I was smart. By senior year, I could mimic any neurotypical kid and could pass for neurotypical. It was all an act, but when forced to live with normals, that was my coping mechanism. Kids still remembered me as weird, but I also grew to be pretty, so boys were willing to overlook weird here and there. And one on one interaction was fine for me. I did not do parties or concerts.College was an all new world. I had almost no accent, could mimic neurotypical, and was pretty. I formed all my friendships for life in college. Still did not have a clue what was wrong with me, or why I was so different, or why I was constantly hiding my true self. People learned I was basically a computer. I could not put myself into someone’s shoes when they were heartbroken or hurting. I did however know what to do when told that was the problem. I had textbook solutions and they worked for most. But my overwhelmed state split into two, I either froze and became catatonic, or I went off in uncontrolled rage. After college, I got a good job and finally went to a psychiatrist. He diagnosed me with Asperger’s. It was eye opening. I developed certain tools to deal with life.I eventually met my husband. Within two weeks of dating, I knew he was special. I sat him down and explained everything. His response was that he liked me as I was, so who cares what “name” my condition had. We have been together for 20 years, married for 17. We have 3 neurotypical kids. I fear that he lost most of his friends because of me over the years, but he says there just isn’t time in our schedules to foster the friendships. He is super introverted, so it does not seem to bother him. The kids have never known anything different. They know I love them. They know I would do anything for them. And they know when they need a hug to just come and hug me. I am never going to initiate hugs, but once they point blank tell me what they need, they get it. I just don’t think of it.I also am in a job that fits me. I do pharmaceutical manufacturing investigations. I am a computer when it comes to engineering details and precedent. I can remember how I handled a situation at a different site 5 years ago and apply it accordingly. Often, my solutions are elegant and solve the issue, so men who normally scoff at women engineers seek my opinion. I am a microbiologist by education, so I am also consulted on micro deviations. And I am a phenomenal technical writer. So, I can write a document in hours that the FDA will not find any issues with in review. So, I get high profile investigations. But, I have limitations. I can lead teams in very structured situations, but I cannot have direct reports. I have my rages well under control, but they bleed through as “somewhat volatile”. I have found a hobby in photography, so it is the best camouflage for social situations and gatherings. Especially at work. I am the site photographer and can be at every gathering because I am focused on photography. So, that has always been my mantra. Camouflage among the neurotypical people.

I'm given to understand that it had been brought up by my teachers in primary school, but my parents didn't want to hear anything about it - I didn't have a problem, I just took after my dad.Which brings me to the point that, really, my father is a poor yardstick for “normal”.

I am pretty sure he also has ASD. He's very good at communicating technical information, but his emotional expression is virtually nonexistent. The only emotion he really displays is anxiety. He plans everything months in advance and has spreadsheets itemising each of our daily expenditures. He tracks the price of cat food at our local pet stores on a weekly basis. Oddly enough, he also loves to travel. We collect things (stamps, coins, cards, erasers).I don't know if I'm more or less well-adjusted than the “average” person with ASD. It's true that I have difficulty coping with social situations without a script. There have also been times when I struggled to understand people because I forgot that they were speaking in generalisations. I have trouble believing that I've accomplished anything if I don't have an itemised list to check off. I don't handle unexpected situations well and have been known to run away/self-injure.I have very minor sensory issues:My psychiatrist thinks undiagnosed ASD contributed to my depression. I don't know that a diagnosis would have helped. I remember always being aware that I was different from the other kids in school, but I was pretty sure they were the weird ones. I genuinely didn't know that some people thought I had social difficulties.",985 followers,Angel Searle,2.1K,760,5.1M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Why-is-there-such-a-push-to-get-female-Space-Marines-Is-it-logical-when-there-are-elite-female-factions-in-40k
26,"Normal is not the word you want to use. You mean neurotypical. Normal literally means average, but it has the unfortunate connotation of meaning the opposite of “abnormal.”What you’re really asking is what happens when an autistic child remains undiagnosed. Millions of autistic people have gone through their childhood, if not their entire lives, without being labelled autistic. Some have struggled with socialization or executive level functioning, or sensory integration, without knowing why. Many simply adjust.

Millions of autistic people have gone through their childhood, if not their entire lives, without being labelled autistic. Some have struggled with socialization or executive level functioning, or sensory integration, without knowing why. Many simply adjust. When the problems are severe enough to interfere with basic life functions, the child is usually diagnosed. If the problems are mild and more than offset by the very real advantages that autism can provide, then there really isn’t any reason for a diagnosis and a label.I was diagnosed at the age of 3 in 1965. The doctor told my mother that I would never learn to talk or socialize or have any significant quality of life. He told her the kindest thing she could do was put me in an institution and forget I was ever born. My mother refused, and when I started talking months later, and learned to read by the age of 4, she believed the doctor was simply wrong about the diagnosis, rather than wrong about the prognosis. So I was raised as any other kid. She told me when I was 12, but we still believed that I wasn’t autistic because autism was still even more poorly understood then than it is today. It wasn’t until my twin nephews were diagnosed that we realized that both my mother and I are autistic, as are likely my two brothers, another nephew, a niece, my grandmother, and my three children. Autism is so prevalent in my family that when my sister turned out neurotypical, my mother thought there was something wrong with her. Only 3 have been formally diagnosed and officially labelled—myself and two of my nephews.My experience is fairly typical among autistic people of my age who seem relatively neurotypical. One of my good friends was also diagnosed at the age of 3, and his mother also told to institutionalize him. She also declined. Today he is a statistics professor. We can look through history to find people who were likely autistic—Einstein, Steve Jobs, William Faulkner, Newton, DaVinci. Not every autistic person is a genius, of course, but most of us have some intellectual or creative advantage that offsets issues caused by autism.In short, if someone can adjust to difficulties well enough to avoid being diagnosed, that’s not a tragedy.",0 followers,Claire Jordan,2.2K,45.6K,295.8M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Why-is-there-such-a-push-to-get-female-Space-Marines-Is-it-logical-when-there-are-elite-female-factions-in-40k
27,"Parents should be treating their child in the best way possible for that child. If your child is having sensory issues or doesn’t want to be hugged on a given day or is sobbing at the idea of going into a mall or into a place with a lot, you listen to the child’s needs. It doesn’t matter whether the child is autistic or not. You deal with their needs and get them to tell you how they feel. If they don’t want to be hugged, discuss with them how they would prefer to be shown affection. Typically, they and you will be able to come up with something.

Don’t force hugs on them even if they are neurotypical. If they don’t like certain foods or textures against their skin, find out what those foods and textures are and find ways to help. If they like pressure, get a compression or weighted shirt (and weighted blanket). If meeting people’s eyes makes them fussy and anxious, tell them to look at people’s forehead or nose instead - most people don’t actually notice provided the person they are speaking with is looking around their eyes and it’s a common way of reducing social anxiety. If they aren’t getting emotional/social cues, find ways to help them get it, regardless of if they are neurotypical or autistic. There are cool flashcards with expressions. There are books like Aliki’s Manners that are super helpful in explaining social cues in understandable ways. Encourage them to explain preferences to others, and for situations where they can’t, find out what self-soothing methods work for them and recommend they find a bathroom or other private place to do them in soon after those situations. If they are flapping, let them flap. If they are dancing, let them dance. They are kids and it makes them happy with no harm to you or others. If it’s disturbing to others, relate it to something they don’t like that others do, and ask them what other ways could satisfy the same need. But these are good ways to raise any child, regardless of if they are neurotypical or not.",1 follower,Alice C,576,22.6K,86.2M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Why-is-there-such-a-push-to-get-female-Space-Marines-Is-it-logical-when-there-are-elite-female-factions-in-40k

I was 4th in my high school class of 483 grade wise.In college I discovered computers and graduated with a Computer Science degree. Social stuff asking girls for a date was very difficult.

I became a computer programmer and married only because my wife made the first move. When our kid was takes back by the birthmother, I went to law school and became a lawyer (18 years as programmer, 20 years as lawyer).My marriage I have been bullied as my wife, friends, and church people tried to make me into NT. I figured out that I was autisic on my own, and had it professionally diagnosed. My wife was against this, telling me it would ruin my career. She was wrong, it goofed up our marriage as she lost control. I was no longer a ”social moron"". My career flourished as I was happy to tell the court system about my autism. My fellow attorneys respected me for it. And I discovered some of my fellow attorneys were as well (all undiagnosed).For me, my life turned out fine. My wife is still trying to adjust, our marriage may or may not last, that remains to be seen. But I have peace because I know what is going on.
