Most of these things below I think are cool but are mostly either too expensive, underutilized, or create a multitude of issues.2.It was a little thicker than a standard credit card, but it contained all of your medical records. Including emergency contact information. it could contain any or all of your credit cards. On your home PC you would load up the info on the credit cards you want to use, and set the applicable priorities. For example you could set the default to use the card with the highest available credit, or the lowest APR, etc. When working with a compatible scanner you could make changes on the fly. It serves as both your passport and any other applicable id that may be required. Like Military ID, or here in the states it would have been a Social Security card. It was yet another step of having everything bundled together. There were a lot of security concerns, as well as some big brother concerns, but ultimately it became moot as most of that functionality can now be done with smart phone apps.3.4.The second was an oven with an integrated INTERNAL webcam. You could watch that turkey roast while you were at home without having to open the oven. Or if you were cooking a roast, you could time it to be done when you got home from work. But you are delayed. So when it is done cooking it would go to a warming temperature, and then eventually a COOLING temperature. To the best of my knowledge this failed to really take off because of some serious concerns about food safety. And how about not wanting THAT to get hacked.5.These were just some fun and wacky ones I liked. Hope you had fun with it.","5,360 followers",Valerio Cietto,677,2.4K,9.1M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-latest-upcoming-futuristic-technologies

In America alone, there are over 3 million drivers, and 7 million people whose jobs depend on those drivers.

(Imagine babysitting an AI that doesn’t need your help, and being paid far less than you used to earn to do that job yourself.)Less known is that Amazon Go, a system that automates the retail experience, is about to eliminate retailing jobs. When Amazon, or a competitor, licenses the system widely, many retailers will adopt it.Why not? It improves profit margins, allows lower prices to customers, and supports a faster in/out experience.But such advances of automation leave millions of people without jobs, and in many cases without job prospects.IBM Watson is busily establishing HUNDREDS of strategic partnerships to replace types of work. (IBM carefully positions this as “assisting” humans. Talk to the hundreds of thousands of humans who were “assisted” out of their jobs by IBM’s Project 2015 outsourcing initiative.)ONE of those partnerships is selling the Ross AI. Ross automates legal research, representing 1/5 of all lawyers’ paid work. Other partnerships are addressing medical professions, education, and many others.This is the most ex...",UNKNOWN,Ben Y.

5,"That trend is not new. It has been happening for many years. Many years ago, someone might expect to be hired by a company straight out of college or out of school and you might spend the rest of your career in that one place until retirement. That scenario isn’t realistic anymore at all.As technology changes, people have to adapt and keep pace or they may be out of a job. That has been a fact of life for a long time and I’m sure that trend will continue into the future. However, I agree with the previous response that its not likely to be a dire and apocalyptic as you might think.","13,518 followers",Saurabh Toshniwal,1.1K,241,7.9M,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-latest-upcoming-futuristic-technologies

8,"Personal helicopters.Regular helicopters have some very big problems that make them extremely expensive to operate.First, they have an incredibly large number of moving parts. That makes them expensive to build and expensive to maintain. Also, a large portion of those moving parts are ""single point of failure"" parts, meaning that if just one part fails, the helicopter crashes and people die. So, many helicopters require more than one hour of maintenance for each hour of flight time.Second, they are challenging to fly, so it takes a great deal of training and practice, so there are very fewPersonal helicopters.Regular helicopters have some very big problems that make them extremely expensive to operate.First, they have an incredibly large number of moving parts.

So, many helicopters require more than one hour of maintenance for each hour of flight time.Second, they are challenging to fly, so it takes a great deal of training and practice, so there are very few people who are able to fly them.But I believe that the same technologies that have created an explosion of personal drones in the last couple years are also going to create an explosion of personal helicopters.Imagine a quadcopter, scaled up to a size that can carry a human pilot...The number of moving parts is tiny - basically just one per motor/propeller plus a handful of moving parts for the control sticks.Redundancy is possible - just use six or eight motor/propellers so that if one of the motors fails, there are enough left to allow continued flight, or at least a controlled landing.Flying is not quiteA small number of enthusiasts have already built personal helicopters by scaling up the same technologies that are used in quadcopters. The concept has been proven. The only question is how long it will be until  you can order one online. The biggest obstacle is battery life - current batteries don't allow for more than a couple minutes of flight. But battery energy density is improving year after year. Between smartphones and electric cars, huge amounts of money is being spent n R&D to create batteries that last longer weigh less, and cost less.Of course, there are some terrifying aspects of this idea...If you make a mistake in a car, there's a good chance that you'll survive. YouIf you make a mistake with a flying vehicle, your odds of survival are much lower. You're probably going to crash somewhere, that crash is likely to result in life-ending or life-changing injuries to you, your passenger(s), and to anyone who has the misfortune of being on the patch of ground that you crash into.Parachutes can help, but even with ballistic (self-opening) parachutes there is still an altitude range for which the parachute won't help much. And even if the parachute works well, you're still likely to land hard, in or on something expensive or dangerous.But right now, a personal helicopter could fall into the FAA's ultralight / experimental rules, meaning that people who want them will be able to get them.I expect some very sad stories before this industry matures. But I also expect this industry to change the way people get around, possibly within just a few years.The first key obstacle to overcome is battery development - how long will it take before we have batteries that allow 20 minute flight times? At that point, 10-minute recreational flights become interesting, and a fair number of people could commute in 10 minutes (remember, there will be almost no traffic, and you can fly straight to your destination).The next key will be air traffic management - how do you stop hordes of home-schooled pilots from crashing into each other? Especially at takeoff and landing sites.I don't know if it will take 5 years or 10 years or 20, but I think there's a pretty good chance that this will get VERY interesting in my lifetime, and probably yours.The EHang 184 Is A Human-Sized Drone Taking Off At CESThe EHang 184 Is A Human-Sized Drone Taking Off At CES",UNKNOWN,Paul O'Brien,1.8K,6.4K,6.8M,2016,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-latest-upcoming-futuristic-technologies
