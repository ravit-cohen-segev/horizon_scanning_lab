Most of these competing job candidates were expecting about the same pay and working conditions - meaning a 40 hour work week in a reasonably safe working environment.

Most of these competing job candidates were expecting about the same pay and working conditions - meaning a 40 hour work week in a reasonably safe working environment. The total worker job market was filled by about 120 million workers.Most businesses in this time period were in competion with other businesses that employeed similar employees, paid similar wages and had about the same overhead costs. Manufacturers made products that had perhaps a few dozen competitors, at most, somwhere within the US.Things changed between that time period and around 2010. We refer to it as globalization and advanced technologies but it also included advances in communications, automation, transportation and management.By 2010, these advances had added about 2.3 billion people to the total worker job market by making it possible to efficiently use labor in China and India and Korea and other nations. These workers were in direct competition with American workers for a lot of jobs but these workers had very different expectations of wages and working conditions. They were quite willing to worl for lower wages and in less than ideal working environments.By 2010, these advances had also added hundreds of thousands of business competitors to the karket place. American businesses were now competition against businesses that paid much lower wages and fewer benefits and had much lower overhead costs. This was true even among other American businesses that had taken advantage of foreign labor, automation and robotics.The result is that the consumer has driven businesses to seek the lowest possible labor and overhead costs so that they can compete in price with the entire global market. The workers have to work at lower wages and take on more hours or work two jobs to make the same amount of income.We now live in a global market in which every business competes against other businesses from all over the world and every worker competes for jobs with workers from all over the world.The consumer is buying the lowest cost products from all over the world which means that consumers in America can strongly influence a business or labor market in China or India.All this happened in about a 20 to 30 year period and it is still going on.In the next 20–30 years, even the low cost human labor in India and China and other countries will be replaced by automation and robotics that will work 24x7 at a fraction the the effective labor wages. The businesses will probably consolidate into mega-multi-national corporations which has facilities all over the globe and sells to consumers all over the globe.The workers will slowly shift into two types - (1) into an ever shrinking services industry that has not yet been automated and (2) a high tech industry that works to design, create, operate and maintain the automation and robotic systems. A third much smaller group will be a mix of R&D and other research including environmental, medical and space.We are working toward a world similar to that portrayed in Blade Runner.","69,835 followers",Marius Kramer,5.3K,2K,192.9M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-happened-to-our-world-because-of-globalization-and-advanced-technologies

We are forced towards global integration and interdependence by Nature’s strict, unforgiving laws since humanity - an integral part, a single, integrated species of Nature - has to become compatible with nature’s system.Without a Nature-like mutual integration within human society, we have no right to exist in the infinitely stronger, larger Natural system, which will simply ‘spit us out” if we do not comply.At this stage, we still, blindly, stubbornly try to exploit our inevitable mutual interconnections for selfish, egotistic benefit and profit. This is most obvious in relation to our technological advancement, since everything, all the tools we have we use to manipulate, exploit and destroy each other. everything is turned either to excessive, individual profit or to weapons against others, or both.As long as we blindly follow our instinctive nature we act like cancer towards each other and Nature.The Natural system, its laws and its relentless evolutionary process towards the most optimal integration of its diverse system will not change. Only we can change and consciously adapt to the system’s seamless, unconditional mutual integration and mutually responsible and mutually complementing cooperation.It is specifically this conscious adaptation to Nature above and against our instinctive tendencies that will make us “Truly Human” beings.","5,084 followers",Bobby Tatro,3.9K,2.2K,45.6M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-happened-to-our-world-because-of-globalization-and-advanced-technologies

That’s the average, on the equator it’s more, on the poles it’s less.2: Energy absorbedOf those 342 watts, a total of 235 watts are absorbed, 67 watts by the atmosphere, 168 by the surface, and 77+30 = 107 watts are reflected back into space.Compared to preindustrial times, Greenhouse gases absorb an additional 2.6 watts/m2. This is calledThe present radiative forcings of each greenhouse gas (compared to their greenhouse effects in pre-industrial times) are:3: Energy absorbed through CO2Since CO2 makes up 1.5 watts/m2 out of the total radiative forcings of 2.6 watts/m2. Thus, at present, carbon dioxide is responsible for 55% of the anthropogenic greenhouse effect, methane is responsible for 18%, nitrous oxide, water vapor and halocarbons for 9% each.This is easy to understand.4: The consequencesThis leads to a cascading greenhouse effect that takes decades to centuries to come into full effect:Due to this effect, a 1% increase in energy absorption results inThis is where we are at right now and this cascading effect is not reversible for several hundred years even if we stopped all CO2 emissions now, since it takes 200 years on average for CO2 to be reabsorbed by the surface or by the oceans.With another doubling of CO2, we can look at a total increase of 10% in energy absorption. Here is what happens when the sun delivered 10% more energy in the past. It led to an average temperature increase of 4 degrees Celcius.A temperature increase of 4 degrees would make the home of 90% of the world’s population uninhabitable and destroy 90% of arable land.Potentially moving to newly thawn land on the poles is also not feasible, because it takes5: What it is notOne of the popular arguments is that water vapor is responsible for the greenhouse effect. It is responsible for 60% of the greenhouse effect, but we cannot contribute to it via human emissions, because human water vapor emissionsThe only way we can contribute to it, is through increased CO2, which heats up oceans and increases water vaporization that goes into the atmosphere.Methane is also a strong greenhouse gas, in fact it is 84 times stronger by volume than CO2. However, its concentration is 250 times less than that of CO2 (0.00017% vs 0.04%). That’s why its contribution to climate change is 5 times less than that of CO2 (4% vs. 26%).Secondly, 80% of the Methane disappears from the atmosphere within 25 years on average while it takes 250 years for 80% of the CO2.So, if we reduced Methane emissions drastically, we would already remove most of its greenhouse effect. However, even if we reduced all CO2 emissions drastically right now, we would not see a reduction of the greenhouse effect and experience the entire cascading effect of CO2 for 200 years.That’s why CO2 is such a bigger problem than Methane or any other greenhouse gas.Read more about this here.This chart also shows how much the increase in those greenhouse gases increased their heat trapping.Here, just some more of those arguments that shows just how little effort is put into fact-checking:You’ve seen that people jump on sound bites like “CO2 is a heavy gas that sinks”, “medival warm period”, believe blatantly fake data without any doubt or fact-checking.This is the oldest technique in the book of pseudo-science, overwhelming the reader with 50 arguments, using scientific words and it works, so that they think it’s true and don’t fact check them.SummaryEarth receives 324 watts/m2 of energy from the sun constantly.Of those 324 watts, a total of 235 watts is absorbed, 67 watts by the atmosphere, 168 by the surface, and 107 watts are reflected back into space.Greenhouse gases increase the energy absorption of sunlight by 1.1% directly compared to pre-industrial times and by 3.3% overall due to the cascading effect.This increases total absorbed watts/m2 by 7.2 watts/m2 from 235 watts to 242.3 watts/m2.This effect is not reversible even if we stopped all CO2 emissions now, since it takes CO2 200 years on average to be reabsorbed by land or by the ocean.We can only try to slow down the cascading effect.All in all, the recent climate change is man-made and these numbers prove it without a doubt.",18 followers,Alex Guerra,1.2K,471,2.1M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-happened-to-our-world-because-of-globalization-and-advanced-technologies
