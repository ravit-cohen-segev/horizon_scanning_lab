Who would have predicted that the most expensive way of making a phone call would be so critical to the developing world? It would be like saying, there are few cars in Africa today (relative to the population) so people will instead choose to fly where they have to go including to work, etc.Personally, I think there are some interesting things on the horizon. Still, I think that we have not managed to deploy existing technology well. I have yet to see a company deploy mobile technologies well. I would be happy if someone just turned a paper form into an app but often the end result is worse.I think that the “basics” will be back and with a vengeance. For example, food/basic farming. The production of meat will have to change. We do not have the ability to generate enough meat to feed the world. For plant based food, I think that we will see Vertical/container farming.We will see aquaculture take off but the best countries are pretty far behind. Aquaculture right now consists of fish farming but that is a negative output. We create fish meal which is mostly made of up meat turned into a pellet and feed that to fish that we eat. Each time you go up a level, you loose about 9/10 of the total energy. So if you take 100 calories of plants and feed that to an animal you end up consuming about 10 calories. Ideally what you want to do is to have an animal that is tasty and eats something that you can’t eat or does not compete as much with what you eat. Its better if its a complement. So, in the case of wheat, you have the plant, seed portion that we eat but the rest can be eaten by cattle (for example.) We can then eat the cattle. If we ate Tigers then this would be a pretty bad calculation, because we would need 1000 plant calories to feed a cow, to get 100 calories to feed a tiger to get 10 calories.The other thing to consider is that fish like Salmon etc do not start out with the vitamins that they contain. They consume them from their environment. We will likely see underwater farming at some point soon enough and this will supplement vertical/container farming. What is holding back this alternative agriculture are archaic rules. For example, people want it to be of a higher standard than normal conventional farming. I think that because it has a lower footprint/resources/pesticide consumption it should be good enough.I know we have felt that outer space etc will be the next frontier but we still do not have a reason to go there. Sending out an exploratory fleet is expensive. Four hundred years ago, a shipment of cinnamon could set you up for life, these days you could easily buy that much cinnamon for much less. Four hundred hears ago it would take a ship, a full crew and a few years. Today, the expenditure/effort is much less.I think that we have seen communication technology come close to peaking, we will see improvements but I do not think it will be as disruptive as the past 30 years. I think that we will see a movement towards a fractured internet, the West, China/Russia and perhaps some others. We have seen this to some extent.I think that we will also see a movement away from technical skills. Programming is turning into a game and that will have issues because, … I think that IOT will exist but it will have a lot of holes and we will have a WWI/WWII situation as a result. We do not know what our weakest links are in our connected world and we may need to break down and segregate things for safety.","5,084 followers",Bobby Tatro,3.9K,2.2K,45.6M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-seven-technologies-that-will-dominate-the-next-30-years

And that’s no exaggeration, viable quantum computers will literally be millions of times more potent at certain vital tasks.Quantum computing is not ready yet — it’s still in its infancy — but very serious progress is being now made. It’s advancing fast.At the same time, thousands more researchers are already making dramatic progress in artificial intelligence using recent breakthroughs in machine learning technology. Already AI can drive cars, recognize faces and diagnose medical conditions with astonishingly prescience.Artificial intelligence is also only in its childhood, but advancing very rapidly.So here’s the question…What happens when we combine the most potent AI techniques with quantum computers… what can we expect when we combine advanced machine learning with computers that are millions of times more powerful than the best we have today?The fact is, no one knows, but for the first time in technological history there is a very real chance that some sort of intelligence will emerge.It may not be independently creative like a human — or even much like a human at all — but it will certainly be able to out-think and out-plan us, able to play the game of life far better than we can.The Up Side…QI machines could be fantastically beneficial in more ways than we can count. We could ask them to work on humanity’s hardest problems and they may be able to come up with solutions no human ever though of, or even be capable of imagining.Or maybe we give the the toughest problems in mathematics and physics to solve, and maybe they can make breakthroughs all by themselves, things we can quickly put to good use.Perhaps we can even ask them to invent ever more potent generations of themselves.The convergence of AI with QC could dwarf any other technology development in human history. The possibilities are endless and the benefits could be huge.There is a down side, but it’s not what you think…Any reasonable person reading this must also ask, what happens if it goes wrong? Do we even understand what we’re doing here? It’s only natural to ask, how screwed are we if one of these things goes all psycho on us?Could it become Skynet and nuke us all? Will we see terminators ravaging the landscape? Could this lead us to a ‘rise of the machines’, completely out of control and bent on killing us?The answer is a resounding NO.You see, their very brilliance is what also makes quantum computers pathetically easy to kill… a single bullet penetrating the quantum isolation chamber will stop a QI in it’s tracks, stone cold dead. Permanently.Rogue machines aren’t a risk, instead the problem is with rogue people and nations, as usual.Quantum Wars…It’s easy to guess that the military of advanced nations like the USA, Russia, China, South Korea, Japan and members of the EU will be early and enthusiastic adopters of QI, once the money they are already pouring into research bears fruit.So the real threat isn’t a single Skynet-like machine going berserk, the danger is we get into a sort of quantumThat is what AI might be like 30 years from now.","135,501 followers",Hector Quintanilla,582,1.2K,88.5M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-seven-technologies-that-will-dominate-the-next-30-years

It took almost 10 years to get them down to a easily-portable size and reliable enough to actually have an intelligible conversation without screaming.The idea that we could merge touch screen technology with cellphones... I don't know of anyone who was actually specualting about that until it happened.Sure,Currently, our rate of innovation is accelerating exponentially. If it continues, or even if shifts to a more geometric rate, what happens fifty years from now is completely outside our ability to imagine.My point is that predicting what will happen, technology-wise, in fifty years is useless.

7,"The fact that you are asking what to learn to take your Excel skills to the next level tells me that you may not have much depth to the stuff you do know. If you had truly mastered formulas and VBA, you would already know what comes next in your particular field—whether that be Power BI, SPSS, R, Python or something completely different.One year of experience repeated 10 times does not give you the same edge as having 10 years of progressive increase in responsibilities. Similarly, the checklist approach to learning Excel does not at all mean that you have mastered either formulas or VBA. RathThe fact that you are asking what to learn to take your Excel skills to the next level tells me that you may not have much depth to the stuff you do know.

Similarly, the checklist approach to learning Excel does not at all mean that you have mastered either formulas or VBA. Rather than seeking to add yet another mediocre skill level, I suggest that you instead aspire to mastering formulas and VBA. Add another skill only if you need it for a project—and then start along the path of mastering it as well.I have a friend who likes to apply the concept of “infinite resistance” to his hobbies. He lifts weights, and each time he increases the amount he lifts, the number of repetitions he is capable of drops dramatically. Over many days of lifting, he can increase the number of reps until he reaches the mid twenties. At that point, he increases the weight, and the process begins anew.Let’s take a look at your level of expertise. How many functions do you feel comfortable building formulas with? Pick one of them. Could you dictate a formula using that function to a colleague to help him solve a problem? Do you know its strengths and weaknesses? Do you know how it behaves in an array formula as opposed to a regular formula? Do you know which error values it might return and why? Have you mastered its optional parameters? I’d be hard-pressed to say that you had mastered that particular function until you could give me good answers to those questions. And I would be reluctant to say that you had mastered formulas until you were comfortable with at least a hundred different functions at that level.VBA is the same. Sure, you can record a macro and edit it to do a simple formatting or data manipulation task. But do you know how and when to use class modules? API functions? Loan objects from VBScript (such as regular expressions or dictionary)? Are you comfortable building a powerful add-in for use by people with little Excel skill? Do you know how to tackle a project that will ultimately result in 50 pages of code? Do you do unit testing?The formula and VBA skills I mentioned aren’t something you can pick up after a few months of playing around. It takes years of intensive use before you become the person everybody goes to for Excel help where you work. And if you are that person, it will take even more years before you become the person answering the tough questions on Excel help forums. It isn’t that you can’t figure out the answers to the questions—it’s that other experts post great answers much faster. And if you do become one of the people who tackle a lot of forum questions, you will probably run into Excel MVPs with even higher skill levels. There will always be somebody better than you. Just like with weightlifting, each time you master skills at one level, infinite resistance means you find another level where you have just scratched the surface.",0 followers,Joseph Anthony,698,0,0,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-seven-technologies-that-will-dominate-the-next-30-years

12,"Ask yourself, “why is VBA still around after MS tried to replace it for some 10+ years?”I also saw someone recently call VBA a “poor man's programming language.”What people fail to realize is that VBA is incredibly easy to learn compared to “rich men's programming languages” where people spend years getting a degree in computer science just to end up failing programming interviews.

I happen to know because I am a professional software developer with a degree in computer engineering and I regularly interview candidates who can't answer the most basic software development questions.The truth is that it takes no time to click “record macro,” do some stuff, and peek at the generated code (albeit poorly written and formatted code).How much time does it take to learn VSTO + C# or the new JavaScript Excel API? How about hooking the new add-in to your workbook? I guarantee it takes a lot more time than learning VBA. There's an incredible amount of stuff abstracted away.Sure, you can argue that learning C# and JavaScript will help you in many other areas where VBA cannot (I develop in the languages myself), but the average manager trying to be more productive with spreadsheets doesn't have much use for these technologies in my opinion.So is VBA worth learning?

Except he bought both cheap because nobody wanted them. He fixed them up and eventually made a boat load of money when other investors rediscovered them.So you can keep chasing the current “next big thing.” And getting surprised, how just after you invest, it implodes.At least you can do that until you run out of money.Or do like old senile Uncle Warren.

A good illustration is the discovery and development of antibiotics. Alexander Fleming discovers Penicillin in 1928 but does little with it despite the potential it offered. It is not until WWII that Chain and Florey begin effectively developing the first antibiotic drugs. In one way at least, World War Two, has and is still, saving lives!","5,084 followers",Bobby Tatro,3.9K,2.2K,45.6M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-seven-technologies-that-will-dominate-the-next-30-years

The result to the societies that embraced this approach was the development into a first-world nation. Those that do not or did not remained or became 3rd-world nations.Although these societies still focused on military development, the success of these militaries are wholly dependent on scientific and technological development and education.We can also look at the impact, by comparison, when a society decides to de-value science and education by looking at the Middle East.Many people do not realize that most stars have Arabic names. As well, the first optical telescope was invented by Arab militaries. The Arab ‘wise men' from the Bible stories reflect this historical understanding toward the reputation of Arab scientists and engineers.Fast forward and there was a religious resurgence that changed these societies’ value system away from science and technology. So these Arab nations plummeted into the 3rd-world within 60 years.Investing in science and technology can have a rapid impact on societies.With this in mind, if a country were to eschew non-scientific priorities, there would be an explosive increase in everything from standard of living all the way to average lifespan.So the question may be, ‘Why would a society decide to reject scientific and technological development?’.Short answer? An educated society cannot be dominated by a political system. They are difficult to control by the nature of education. People can easily say, ‘That does not make any sense!’, and politicians (religions are political entities as well), do not want to have to compromise or accommodate with their population.So if a political process begins to represent education as a risk to society? Or prioritize control of access to information? You can be assured that their motives are not associated with the success of the people, but instead with the accumulation and centralization of power.What was Trump’s first action? The removal of the Federal Dept of Education. The second step? The gag orders with the Environmental Protection Agency. And the third? The repeal of Net Neutrality (where ISPs can restrict access to websites and information).This is not accidental.Given this, even the US, with all of our scientific institutions, is not immune to a collapse of our society into religious or political domination.",18 followers,Asim Qureshi,17K,996,155.9M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-seven-technologies-that-will-dominate-the-next-30-years
