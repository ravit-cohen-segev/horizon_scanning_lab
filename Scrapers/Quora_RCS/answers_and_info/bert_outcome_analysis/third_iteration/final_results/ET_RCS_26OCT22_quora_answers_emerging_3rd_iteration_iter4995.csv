EverTheIt was fascinating to see how the hotel had stripped out every single cost factor without breaking the law. There was literally nobody on site. Key collection was done via some sort of card code thing. There was a single vending machine in the lobby, plus a rack of flyers advertising local “attractions”.The hotel was constructed in a completely modular, pre-fab style. Everything was bolted down, and designed for easy cleaning. It was a bit like staying in a minimum-security prison.Note the slightly disturbing single-piece toilet-shower combination of easy-clean plastic, non-slip grippy surface, and unsettlingly gaping vent above the shower head.In the reception area, the toilet was some sort of ingenious dystopian monster thing, like an aircraft toilet but somehow worse. When you closed the door, the thing “cleaned” itself by spraying various liquids all around inside the cubicle, and then dried itself with some noisy fans.From what I gathered, humans came past once a day to change the bedsheets and replace the toilet paper, since they hadn’t worked out how to automate that yet.The hotel did its job, i.e. provide me with safe, cheap, clean-enough accommodation. But it was so stripped-down that it felt like sleeping in a 1970s sci-fi horror future. I saw almost no humans, and I only knew that they were there by the sound of slamming doors in the corridor. The atmosphere was so dead that it was almost post-apocalyptic.This was in the days before touchscreen-everything and check-in-by-app. Now, it’s probably possible to do something quite similar, but with a more friendly, “alive” kind of experience, via the judicious deployment of apps and gadgets. And a bit of interior design would go a long way.",36 followers,Adam Ambrozy,579,0,0,2019,https://www.quora.com/Do-you-think-technology-will-ever-replace-human-interaction-in-hotels-Why-why-not
