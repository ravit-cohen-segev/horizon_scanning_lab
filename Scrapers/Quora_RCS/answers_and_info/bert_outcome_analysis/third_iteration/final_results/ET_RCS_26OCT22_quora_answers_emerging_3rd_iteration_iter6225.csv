Their purposes in questioning our sanity might not be the same. Some would do it for gain, some would do it for good.","220,625 followers",Franklin Veaux,1.8K,47.3K,783M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Do-you-think-technology-will-evolve-to-a-point-that-it-may-question-our-sanity

Someday though.

3,"Yes. That started with the discovery of fire and the technology of cooking. Cooking releases more nutrients from food, enabling larger, more nutrient-hungry brains. Agriculture, one of the largest technological innovations in human history, accelerated that trend.Technology has shaped our evolution since the beginning.","220,625 followers",Franklin Veaux,1.8K,47.3K,783M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Do-you-think-technology-will-evolve-to-a-point-that-it-may-question-our-sanity
4,"You'll need to define ""meaningful technology."" It would seem to me that meaningful technology predates Homo sapiens sapiens. Our not-quite-human ancestors were already using fire, something no other species (well, genus anyway) has ever done, and we were making unprecedented use of stone tools. Throw in use of perishable materials like fibers, leather, and wood to make tools and garments, and we were able to spread out from Africa and the Middle East to colonizeYou'll need to define ""meaningful technology.""

5,"Technology is evolving according to the law of demand! We basically build and improve what the market wants to buy! For me this is an 'out-of-control' way of evolving. We become more and more disconnected from nature and rely more on  ""dependable"" tech. For example, thanks to technological advances humans now are more educated than ever before. But that knowledge is not generally used. Whereas a few decades and even centuries ago, people where less educated, but were wiser, they could make better use of the knowledge they had, and better use of their mental and physical abilities.Technology iTechnology is evolving according to the law of demand!

So, yes technology will inevitably evolve! Does it need direction? I think so! It should also occupy it's rightful position : Besides humans, not in front.9","105,674 followers",Dave Consiglio,544,6.8K,91.6M,2016,https://www.quora.com/Do-you-think-technology-will-evolve-to-a-point-that-it-may-question-our-sanity
6,"Humans are very likely evolving faster today than at almost any time in the past. Sounds crazy, right? How could this be? Let me explain.Most people think of evolution as operating on members of a species with “inferior” traits, thereby reducing their survivability and ultimate contribution to the gene pool. With this understanding, you’d then point to our modern longevity and note that “humans have largely solved the problem of survivability” — which we have. We can remedy poor eyesight, compensate for chronic diseases, vaccinate against plagues, work around infertility, etc. But this understHumans are very likely evolving faster today than at almost any time in the past.

With this understanding, you’d then point to our modern longevity and note that “humans have largely solved the problem of survivability” — which we have. We can remedy poor eyesight, compensate for chronic diseases, vaccinate against plagues, work around infertility, etc. But this understanding is based on a narrow view of evolution.Evolution operates at a species wide level across vast periods of time. And what is it looking for? You might say, “survival of the fittest” or “natural selection”. And that’s where a lot of the confusion comes from. With ever longer lifespans and no natural predators, evolution seems to be way back in the rear view mirror for Homo sapiens. But what evolution really cares about isSo if we want to see if humans are evolving, we need to look for any signs ofSource:A Tale of Two Fertilities - Africa and Everywhere Else.
