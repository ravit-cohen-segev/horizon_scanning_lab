0,"Probably because when they include CEG, they include MIT as well.MIT is a part of Anna University Chennai. So I believe when people include CEG they include MIT as well.MIT and CEG are in no way superior or inferior to each other. MIT is equally good as CEG.PS: I am from CEG.",UNKNOWN,Anonymous,1.5K,0,0,2015,https://www.quora.com/Why-isnt-the-Madras-Institute-of-Technology-ranked-among-the-top-100-engineering-institutes-in-India-by-any-magazine-or-website
1,"I am asked to write answer to this question by an unknown friend. The points below are fully on my perception only. I agree with Venkat Krishnan CEG and MIT are not viewed as separate colleges outside Anna university. But it is bitter truth the standard of Anna university is declining.First of all the question says that the PSG and CEG are ranked at top 25. I am not sure of the sources from which this has been taken, but surely the standard of MIT is declining. And also the standard of CEG also declining. CEG also not on top colleges as per wikipediea ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_I am asked to write answer to this question by an unknown friend.

CEG also not on top colleges as per wikipediea ( https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Indian_engineering_college_rankings ). In 2007 Anna university was ranked as 7th best university all over India. So what has been changed after 2007?The number of seats increased. The entrance exam cancelled. So the quantity increased and quality is diminished. The increase in number of students, results in lack of quality/experienced teachers. If entrance was not cancelled same set of students may came with more problem solving skills. Is this affected standard so much? No these contribution to decline is less than 1%. Then what affected the rank?How many of us have attended the seniors classes on core subjects?I doubted even if they are happening now. During my second year I attended the senior class on DBMS. The complex concept was explained very clearly by him. Not only the book things were discussed, he explained A-Z on it. But most of them not cared such class were there. So even there are not experienced/quality teachers,but we had very good seniors.How many of us attended PDA Apps test/Juggernaut? We can participate in it from our second year. We had opportunity to improve our problem solving skill and self confidence.The rank is not only about placements, it is mainly based on the quality of engineers its producing. How many of mechanical stream engineers are working in the same stream? About one third are working in the stream which is not related to their UG. Before 2008 recession, our seniors will wait for job of their level. Whether they had good knowledge on the subject or not, they waited, they prepared, they used the help of seniors to get the righteous job.But after recession there is fear of unemployment and all of us are ready to took any job on our way",26 followers,Balaji Viswanathan,14.3K,5.6K,427M,2015,https://www.quora.com/Why-isnt-the-Madras-Institute-of-Technology-ranked-among-the-top-100-engineering-institutes-in-India-by-any-magazine-or-website
2,"A2A.I think it is worth doing a masters in food science/ food process engineering abroad. I have been recently preparing to apply to foreign universities as I’m completing my degree in May/June 2021. My top priority is Canada, 2nd is Germany/ New Zealand. You cannot sustain in Germany without knowing their language, I tried learning but failed to do so. Then I dropped the option of Germany it just didn’t work out for me. I chose Canada because it has better PR options, reasonable tuition fees and after graduation a good pay for food engineers/quality technicians.There are two kinds of degree fA2A.I think it is worth doing a masters in food science/ food process engineering abroad.

I chose Canada because it has better PR options, reasonable tuition fees and after graduation a good pay for food engineers/quality technicians.There are two kinds of degree for food science in Canada. Research based/Course based. In research based degree, you have to complete a thesis and the duration would be of two years. In course based, normally it has a research project and the duration would be an year or an year and a half. This kind of degree would be given as M.Sc(Food Science).There is also an another option who have completed their Bachelors in Engineering (Food Science and Technology/Food Process Engineering). There are masters in Biological Engineering and Biosystems Engineering in Canada where you can choose specialized courses choosing common engineering courses and food engineering courses. Some are research based and some are course based.I have also done some research for countries like USA, UK, New Zealand, Germany and Australia. I f you wanna know more please DM me. I would reply within a day or two.","21,936 followers",Vidhi Khandel,20K,182,11.1M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Why-isnt-the-Madras-Institute-of-Technology-ranked-among-the-top-100-engineering-institutes-in-India-by-any-magazine-or-website

4,"Good? It's the best option. Even I am studying food technology and planning to go to Germany for my masters. But there is one thing. In Germany there are only a few universities having masters in food technology. Most of the universities have masters in food sciences. There's a difference between both. If you are planning to go to Germany, you have to search a lot for the perfect college.Peace out.","4,696 followers",Anton Taiki,1.6K,4.4K,30.7M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Which-universities-in-the-world-have-top-Food-Technology-program
5,"Wow, I’ve never seen a question on Quora so riddled with nonsense answers. There isn’t a single science-based answer that reflects the current medical consensus anywhere in the first ten listed here!* It’s not until I got down toWow, I’ve never seen a question on Quora so riddled with nonsense answers. There isn’t a single science-based answer that reflects the current medical consensus anywhere in the first ten listed here!* It’s not until I got down toAs Robert Devor correctly points out, there are a couple of main reasons why not only are the majority of the answers here dangerously wrong, but in fact the question itself is the wrong question.I am writing here only because this kind of misinformation is dangerous, and contributes to the misunderstanding of what cancer is and how it works. It also misunderstands how food works. And though my answer will probably be buried in the middle of the pile of nonsense here because people want a magical cure, I’m still going to write it in the hope that even one person who reads it will potentially learn to think about this question correctly, and not mess around with something as important as one’s lifetime health.I’m going to put a picture of a cancer here, mostly because answers with pictures seem to get higher view counts and rankings, and I am hoping to break through the giant pile of BS in the way. Here goes:This particular picture is of a carcinoma of the lung. This kind of cancer is one of the many that doesn’t give a crap what you eat. It will form and try to kill you no matter how many vitamins, magic berries, keto or paleo feasts, or whatever type of alkaline nonsense you try to feed it. Of course, not smoking so much will probably help.You see those papayas in the second picture near the right hand side? Stop looking so closely, you psycho. It’s just a representation of a variety of foods. If you’re looking too closely at one particular thing that you hope will save you, you’ve missed the point. We know what the stuff is that you can probably eat more of. Lean proteins, fruits, vegetables, and whole grains are good stuff. Eggs and dairy are good stuff as long as you don’t go crazy with saturated fat levels. Eat lots of different stuff. Colorful stuff, savory stuff, crunchy stuff. This isn’t that hard.I think that guy on the right is looking at the girl’s butt in front of him, right?. That’s a fringe benefit of doing some exercise, probably. Win/win!Rowing is so posh. You’re like an Ivy Leaguer!Nice dish, Dave! (I mean, I think he looks like a Dave. Could be Jason or Walter.)Hey you, dude in this stock image: you definitely need some help on your backhand grip. Call me, I can help with that. But good for you for exercising. Cancer called, and it’s really pissed! (And make sure you’re wearing sunscreen…you know, because cancer. ht: Simon Moore)Ok, so where does that leave us? There are quite a few ways to lower your risk of cancer, at least a little bit. And most of them have to do with lifestyle, avoiding obviously dangerous things, consulting with a good doctor on at least an annual basis, and getting a bit of variety in your life. But THERE IS NO FAD DIET OR SPECIFIC FOOD THAT HAS THE BEST CHANCE OF PREVENTING THE DEVELOPMENT OF CANCER. So stop trying to vilify food. Diets are just systems of subtracting foods from your life, and you want to add them. Just eat a variety of things (yes, even gluten), and eat lower amounts of the things you know aren’t the best sources of nutrition. The latest scare foods will change in a few years, as they always do. But none of the things you eat are magic. Stop trying to do magic with food. Magic isn’t real. And for the love of all that is sensible in this world, please don’t go on some nonsense diet just to put a few more pennies in the pockets of the quacks and opportunists who try to sell you diet books, or listen to their brainwashed acolytes. That’s right, here it is again: THERE IS NO FAD DIET OR FOOD THAT HAS THE BEST CHANCE OF PREVENTING THE DEVELOPMENT OF CANCER. Now go outside and play. Sheesh.*This was true of the answer order at the time of writing, but I don’t track relative answer position constantly, so I will have no idea if it remains so. Also, it turns out that Quora shows answers in different orders to different people, based on various algorithms. This presumably means that they’ll be showing the woo-based answers in higher position to people who are already inclined to believe such pablum. That would be a shame.","1,002 followers",Michael Woods,1.5K,107,598K,2021,https://www.quora.com/Which-universities-in-the-world-have-top-Food-Technology-program
