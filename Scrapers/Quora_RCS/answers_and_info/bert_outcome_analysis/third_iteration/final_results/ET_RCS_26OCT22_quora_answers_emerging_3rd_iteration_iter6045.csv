0,"As an experienced airline pilot I can tell you that with the technology today an aircraft can do 97% of actual taxing, takeoff, cruise, landing, and even taxing to your assigned gate. However, I would never board any aircraft without a trained pilot at the controls. I believe no matter far we come with technology with the whole autopilot of aircraft and even with vehicles, there will always be required to have human interaction involved.",17 followers,Randy Duncan,854,1.1K,34.1M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Are-computers-making-airline-pilots-obsolete-Computers-might-be-better-than-pilots-in-most-situations-If-pilots-are-better-in-a-few-cases-the-risk-might-be-acceptable-A-ground-based-pilot-could-take-over-a-plane-remotely-in-emergency-situations

A catastrophic failure of the #2 engine sent shrapnel at supersonic speeds through fuel tanks, fuel lines, fuselage, wing leading edge devices, hydraulic lines and multiple cable looms. 21 of the 22 redundant systems on the aircraft were either destroyed or severely damaged. The onboard computer systems designed to diagnose inflight faults and suggest courses of action couldn’t cope with the cascading failures of so many multiple systems at once.The aircraft had an engine that had exploded, 2 engines that had been degraded to only 35%, and one engine that could not be shut down, only limited roll capability, no slats, no reverse thrust, limited brakes and no ability to dump fuel. Communications with the ground were also severely limited with the loss of most radio systems. They also could not pump fuel around from tank to tank (a vital process used to keep the giant aircraft balanced) -a problem that was getting steadily worse with each passing minute as the plane became more and more unbalanced.This should have been the world’s worst single aircraft accident. And it would have been if the flight computers (in their current primitive form) were trying to land the crippled super-jumbo. Instead a well trained, experienced, well-rested crew worked the problem. They stabilized the jet, carried out system and handling checks, and thoroughly planned their approach. They only had a 4 knot approach speed window between stalling the aircraft and landing too fast to stop before the end of the runway at Changi. They pulled up with 100 metres to spare, and without a single injury to a passenger.The whole ordeal has been called the most outstanding example of airmanship ever demonstrated in commercial aviation (and that includes Sully’s incredible Hudson work) Until the AI is as smart as a human, and completely self-contained so that this sort of accident couldn’t compromise its systems, I would rather put the lives of my loved ones in the hands of a human pilot.As for the idea that grounded pilots could take over in an emergency, this would require a real-time up/downlink with the aircraft (in QF32’s case this was damaged) and the ability to control every switch, lever and knob in the cockpit. In other words, a complete cockpit mockup. (a simulator) In an emergency you would also need the pilots to be available immediately. You would not have time to call them at home, get them to drive in to work and then fly the airplane. So you would need a fleet of simulators (one for every aircraft you had airborne) , all with pilot sitting in them ready to take over at a moment’s notice….","1,922 followers",David Keasal,2K,2.8K,5.9M,2017,https://www.quora.com/Are-computers-making-airline-pilots-obsolete-Computers-might-be-better-than-pilots-in-most-situations-If-pilots-are-better-in-a-few-cases-the-risk-might-be-acceptable-A-ground-based-pilot-could-take-over-a-plane-remotely-in-emergency-situations

There is no compendium of incidents where the pilots saved the airplane from certain doom. It doesn't make for sexy print, but in the aviation community, these near-mishaps are generally published and studied in order to spread the knowledge to other pilots. It's a sort of ""Holy moly, you don't want this to happen to you"" collection of tales. Now, certainly this sort of learning would need to be part of any automation, but it is going to take a few decades of teaching the computer how to fly and recognize these situations that are handled intuitively by trained pilots.

3,"This is an excellent and timely question.

Pilot unions in the U.S. were stunned, and had the language removed from the bill through their protests and lobbying. Part of their rationale was that reducing required pilots from two to one was a slippery slope and soon we would have no pilots at all onboard cargo and passenger aircraft alike. The flying public might like to have its say before we go down that path.Obviously, reducing or eliminating onboard pilots would solve a number of problems for airlines and air freight companies. No one wants their business to be held hostage to a technician as specialized as an airline pilot, particularly when they so often operate on a union-negotiated contract. Further, the job has suffered so much reputational damage in recent decades that it’s lost popularity with young people choosing a career, creating an impending pilot shortage which could hinder air commerce in some parts of the world.The technology for mostly safe, pilotless air travel is already here. If the Navy can land aThere is another issue: two different types of aircraft-malfunction outcomes. In one, an aircraft so terribly damaged inflight that a crash would seem inevitable is instead brought to a safe landing or at least a ditching/crash landing where most or all aboard survive; in the other, an aircraft which suffers a relatively small malfunction crashes and kills most or all aboard because of an inappropriate response by the pilots. In recent decades we have seen far more of the latter (e.g. Air France flight 447) than the former (e.g. US Airways flight 1549), but we continue to see both. The driving factor in these different outcomes is the caliber of pilot at the controls. It is simply a tautology that more carefully selected, better trained and more widely experienced pilots, particularly when operating in an open work environment where their professionalism is respected, are the still the best safety tool available in aviation.Your question is timely because as we speak, many airlines around the globe are working hard to “de-professionalize” the work of airline pilots for purely commercial reasons. These airlines are mostly the newer, fast-growing airlines, and mostly of the type that market deeply discounted fares. They de-professionalize pilots with the full collaboration of their national regulatory agencies, who allow them to train their pilots to operate as “ADFC’s,” or “Automation-Dependent Flight Crews” (a term which is only in very informal use at this time). It may sound harsh, but you can think of AFDC’s as “dumbed-down pilots” — either underqualified, working in a high-pressure labor environment where they are kept in fear, or both. They are more often called “systems operators” and “button pushers.” They tend to work longer hours for less pay, and their numbers are sharply on the rise worldwide. Most fatal airline accidents occurring globally can now be directly attributed to them. They are evidence of a basic abuse of the built-in automation of modern airliners, which was intended to give highly qualified pilots greater situational awareness but has increasingly been employed to give mediocre pilots sufficient cover to go unnoticed until it is too late.It is unknown if fully automated/remotely piloted airliners would be safer or more dangerous than present-day airliners piloted by ADFC’s, because we have no data on the former; what we do know is that present-day airliners operated by highly competent pilots represent the closest thing we’ve ever seen to “Safety Nirvana.”If the issue of dumbed-down pilots/no pilots should ever become a topic for public debate, there will be two clear sides: the global airline industry (particularly in emerging economies) which calculates “acceptable risks,” and on the other side the traveling public, air passenger associations, pilot unions and some aviation safety researchers. The outcome will likely be the trial implementation of pilotless passenger aircraft in certain countries (China comes to mind), blocked however from penetrating the airspace of certain other countries. Based on how that goes, we will see the idea gain or lose traction. I expect to see such trials within a decade.",17 followers,Randy Duncan,1.2K,1.1K,34.1M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Are-computers-making-airline-pilots-obsolete-Computers-might-be-better-than-pilots-in-most-situations-If-pilots-are-better-in-a-few-cases-the-risk-might-be-acceptable-A-ground-based-pilot-could-take-over-a-plane-remotely-in-emergency-situations
4,"From my perspective, the opposite situation to what you describe actually is the case, at least for the foreseeable future.  Emergencies are where automation can get fouled up the most, and any non-standard operational situations encountered mid-flight are likely to create electronic confusion.Routine flights where everything goes exactly as anticipated are increasingly easy to automate, to the point that the pilots tend to find themselves in the role of being system managers and monitors more than actually getting to exercise their skills.  On-board systems can indeed manage flight parametersFrom my perspective, the opposite situation to what you describe actually is the case, at least for the foreseeable future.  Emergencies are where automation can get fouled up the most, and any non-standard operational situations encountered mid-flight are likely to create electronic confusion.Routine flights where everything goes exactly as anticipated are increasingly easy to automate, to the point that the pilots tend to find themselves in the role of being system managers and monitors more than actually getting to exercise their skills.  On-board systems can indeed manage flight parameters and optimize the efficient operation of the aircraft more precisely than the average pilot... as long as everything follows the playbook.The biggest limitations associated with letting robots fly and dispensing with pilots are:1.""Complex systems such as commercial aircraft are difficult for operators to manage. Designers, intending to simplify the interface between the operator and the system, have introduced automation to assist the operator. In most cases, the automation has helped the operator, but at times operator confusion as to what the automation is doing has created dangerous situations that lead to property damage or loss of life. This problem, known as mode confusion, has been difficult to analyze and thus solutions tend to be reactive instead of proactive.""2.Any and all of these conditions require pilots and air traffic controllers to respond to and manage them in real time.  Sophisticated unmanned aircraft like the Northrop Grumman RQ-43.There probably will be workable, 100% (or close enough) reliable solutions to everything I've described above.  However, we aren't there yet.  Even if Moore's Law continues to operate and on-board computational power continues to double every couple of years, I doubt even the smartest artificial intelligences will be capable of handling all aviation operations on their own until mid-century at the earliest.  (I don't plan on riding on anything like that until I'm satisfied that it can handle everything that's thrown at it, so I'll probably be in the ground before I get a chance to do so.)","9,988 followers",Brett Bergan,790,7K,83.5M,2015,https://www.quora.com/Are-computers-making-airline-pilots-obsolete-Computers-might-be-better-than-pilots-in-most-situations-If-pilots-are-better-in-a-few-cases-the-risk-might-be-acceptable-A-ground-based-pilot-could-take-over-a-plane-remotely-in-emergency-situations
5,"The future is a big place.  If that's not possible next year, it will be in 50 or 100 years, or in 1,000 years.  Or later.It's possible with today's technology but there are some obvious issues:1. Psychology.How likely are you to get on a pilotless airplane?  How confident are you that someone on the ground far away, with a warm cup of coffee in his hand, will do everything in his power to get the plane safely on the ground as if his own life depends on it?  How much faith do you have in the remote controller?  Or if you are thinking about taking even a remote pilot out of the equation: hoThe future is a big place.

How much faith do you have in the remote controller?  Or if you are thinking about taking even a remote pilot out of the equation: how confident are you that the engineers who programmed the autopilot thought about every conceivable scenario and didn't oversee any glitch in the autopilot so that human intervention is not needed?2. Security.As soon as you are putting a signal in the air to remote control a plane, it can be hacked into.  Terrorists don't even have to be on the flight anymore to inflict maximum disaster on multiple flights.  If you exclude a remote control possibility then who's there to prevent a terrorist damaging the autopilot, dooming everyone on board?3. Other traffic, weather, failures, unique scenariosA human brain is an excellent problem solving machine.  If something unexpected comes up or there's anything that takes a plan away from perfect execution, the human brain is quick in coming up with plan B or C or D... Even pick the best option between many.  And the way aviation works today means there are plenty of variables that require a human problem solver.4. The safety dipEven when a perfect autopilot can be programmed, possibly with a super secure remote control backup, there will be a test and transition period.  Let's not be naive and assume all is going to go well and smooth from day one.  Who's going to take it on them to be the Guinea pigs?  What airline is going to play with the lives of their customers to be the first ""progressive"" ones?  We're not talking about being a pioneer and go to Mars here, we're talking about being on a pilotless airplane!  There's no adventure in that, no fame, no discovery.  You're a test subject to possibly increase the profit margins of a corporation.5. Insurance and costsEven though it may be the stuff of legends, the price you pay for your ticket does not go mostly towards the pocket of the pilots in front.  An important cost for an airline is insurance.  This is not my terrain but I can imagine that the extra risks justify such higher insurance fees that pilots turn out to be ultra cheap labour.Technology is there to help us.  We don't generally like to do technology for technology's sake, especially when safety is concerned.  If the benefits clearly outweigh the costs, then it will happen.  At the moment the risks are too high, the costs too steep, the organisation non existent and the benefits too feeble.For years now you can have automatic sliding doors in your home, like on the Enterprise in Star Trek.  How many people actually have that in their home?  If the benefits don't outweigh the costs you're quite happy to open your door with turning a knob and a swing, don't you?I think we'll see driverless cars and land based automation long before passenger airplanes will take you to your holiday destination without pilots on board.  It will come some day, but not in the immediate future the way I see it.","41,155 followers",Craig Good,796,19.7K,90.2M,2016,https://www.quora.com/Are-computers-making-airline-pilots-obsolete-Computers-might-be-better-than-pilots-in-most-situations-If-pilots-are-better-in-a-few-cases-the-risk-might-be-acceptable-A-ground-based-pilot-could-take-over-a-plane-remotely-in-emergency-situations

The thing is we have to take a look at the innards of a country to really know whether or not you are truly developed. That Chinese are so obsessed with portraying the facade that they are technologically advanced and ahead is actually an indication that they have not fully developed yet. Because fully developed countries have no need to show off things like that. Everyone knows they are developed.For example, here is San Francisco:Look, not many skyscrapers right? And look at those old cable cars going around! That must mean they are undeveloped right? Nope. Everyone knows San Francisco is a developed city. That’s why it has no need to show off with luxury skyscrapers and such things.Or how about Florence, Italy?Again, no skyscrapers here. But everyone knows it’s a developed city and Italy is a developed country.My point is, you have got to look at the people and the innards of a country to truly know if they are developed.This is the true face of China:You have got to look at the average person. Does the average Chinese have good access to healthcare (which is ranked near the bottom in WHO rankings btw)? Can they drink tap water safely? Do they have access to quality food? Do all have access to electricity or paved roads or a quality education? The answer is: probably, yes, if you are living in the rich east coast provinces of Jiangsu or Zhejiang or Guangdong- but not if you are living in say - Xinjiang or Gansu or Tibet. China’s wealth is not spread equally, neither is it developed equally. Even though the CCP has developed China quite fast - there is still a lot of work to be done making sure *every Chinese* have equal access to everything.And then you got to look at the attitude of the people. When I was in China I found that you really got to look out for who you trust, because there is a lot of scams going on all the time. You never know what is real, what is fake, what is real price of anything. Why do these scams exist? Because people have to be desperate to make money that’s why.Why are people desperate to make money? Probably because they are not making enough to survive, which is an indication that the country is still developing. You’ll notice that in general, the more developed a country is, the less likely there will be scams. In Korea/Japan/Taiwan, you will not find very many scams. In China and Eastern Europe it’s likely.Another aside I want to note is that Chinese bathrooms don’t contain any toilet paper. Do you know the reason why? It’s because people steal it. Now, in what developed country does this happen? I can’t think of any. Only in a developing country would you need to bring your own toilet paper to the bathroom because there isn’t any there due to fear of people stealing it.I find GDP/capita to be generally a pretty good indicator of how developed a country is. The average GDP/capita (PPP) of China is still around $8k/person. While that is higher than most Asian countries - it’s still below the 4 East Asian tigers + Japan and far from the $62k/person that the USA has.The true measure of a developed society is to observe the people that live in the country and not the appearance of the country itself. Chinese “face” culture is the same. You can just obviously see that China has developed really really fast, and mentality wise people are still harping about luxury products and consumerism - this is where Americans were back in the 50s, 60s and 70s, not now.The biggest consumers of luxury products are Chinese people, not Americans or Europeans. The more developed you are, the less need you have to validate your self worth with materialism. The less desire you have to spend thousands of dollars on your children's schooling just to send them to be educated abroad. The less need to travel to countries like Canada or USA for giving birth so that your child becomes a US or Canadian citizen, or to launder your money by buying up real estate in other countries. Developed countries do not need to do things like that.Thats why you should always pay attention to the old adage -Edit:Of course, Chinese commenters love to bring up the USA. Yes, USA has lots of impoverished areas too; every country has developed areas and undeveloped areas, however my point is that for China there is significantly more undeveloped areas at a higher % compared to the USA. The poverty rate for China is 16% as of 2019 and for USA it is 1.5% as of 2019.

So I have some familiarity about how average Americans think of China.I was anti-China person myself until after moving to the Asian continent in South Korea from 2001 to 2007. At the time, I was just an ESL (English as a Second-language) teacher and not doing anything remarkable with my life. When I decided to move to Seoul, I was struggling professional career wise after graduating from college with a B.A. degree in Political Science.I learned the hard way that when studying at a Liberal Arts’ school and deciding not to pursue a career path as professor or lawyer you will likely confront many challenges finding a stable and high-paying job.Despite my love for reading Shakespeare, Aristotle and Tolstoy, it’s not easy persuading potential employees that my passion for reading the Western Classics should should place me as top priority in the hiring process.But I have lived and learned from it and moved on. Nonetheless, I felt more comfortable among Asians as many of them are eager to learn, hard working and ambitious.But there was a harder edge to life in South Korea than I had anticipated. It was my experience that many South Koreans were perfectionists, quick tempered and impatient.But when people ask me why I chose to move to Korea back then it was simple. I wanted to try a new adventure and loved to travel. When reviewing job ads, there was a message about teaching English in South Korea and it captured my curiosity but to be honest I was not interested in teaching just wanted to try something new.So I called up the recruiter and two weeks later I was on a plane to work there. If the job ad said teach English in Japan, Vietnam, China or any other Asia-Pacific country I would have gone there without pondering the differences among Asian nations.I mention this story to explain the notable ignorance on foreign affairs among average Americans. I was anti-China but I went to school, read books and most Americans I spoke to had hated China. I was young and never visited China so I made the logical conclusion that China is bad because most of my fellow Americans thank that’s true.My perspective had changed dramatically after moving to South Korea and meeting local businessmen who told me they loved making trips to China and said the country was much better than what many others were saying.I took a weekend trip to Shanghai in 2005 and discovered the Chinese were not brainless Marxists, fanatical political zealots or ideologues, they were regular people and loved to enjoy life just like average Americans. The trip opened my eyes and knew I could feel comfortable in China if I choose to move there.And that’s what happened. I came to Beijing over 10 years ago and have stayed here. I point out that average Americans are not hearing the real story about China.Many scholars with fancy titles and prestigious academic resumes are claiming to be ‘China experts,’ but they do nothing more than spew China hate. Their only expertise is knowing how to criticize China and sound convincing to others.My recommendation for average Americans would be to encourage you to visit China and check it out for yourself.WeChat: 86 13439758718","23,887 followers",Robin Daverman,11.8K,2.3K,40.1M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Are-computers-making-airline-pilots-obsolete-Computers-might-be-better-than-pilots-in-most-situations-If-pilots-are-better-in-a-few-cases-the-risk-might-be-acceptable-A-ground-based-pilot-could-take-over-a-plane-remotely-in-emergency-situations

But I think the main reason is complacency and a tendency of resting on her laurels of past greatness.During the Qing dynasty, there was a very narcissistic emperor by the name of Qianlong (乾隆), who self-styled himself as a “十全老人” (perfect old man) in his old age. He also thought that there was nothing China could learn or gain from others, including the west.

Why? The reasons are many and varied. But I think the main reason is complacency and a tendency of resting on her laurels of past greatness.During the Qing dynasty, there was a very narcissistic emperor by the name of Qianlong (乾隆), who self-styled himself as a “十全老人” (perfect old man) in his old age. He also thought that there was nothing China could learn or gain from others, including the west. So, when the first British mission to China led by George Macartney met emperor Qianlong in 1793, and requested freer trades with China, among other things, Qianlong rejected all of his requests.But we all know that this was the time when Britain had already undergone its First Industrial Revolution from about 1760, and was on its way to industrial greatness, scientific discoveries, technological advances, and also further on to international colonial expansion. So, what followed were the 1st Opium War in 1840 and the 2nd Opium War in 1860, when China was utterly thrashed; and then the cession of Hong Kong to Britain plus all the other unequal treaties forced on China.So, as we can see from what happened above, one of the major reasons of China falling behind the west was China's complacency; they rested on the laurels of China's past achievement. And emperor Qianlong's attitude was a classic example.As a matter of fact, for the most part of human civilization prior to 1800s, China had been THE leading nation in practical innovation, as exemplified in the four great inventions the compass, gun power, paper and printing, without any of which, our world would still be in a medieval era. Added to these, the Chinese also invented a seismograph almost 2000 years ago. Other inventions like the porcelain and paper money surely have profound effects on man's daily life. But sadly, instead of following the path of inventing rockets and weapons, the Chinese used gun powder for leisure and pleasure: making fire crackers and fireworks. Perhaps the Chinese are innately peace-loving ! On the other hand, the Europeans made deadly weapons like rifles and cannons to conquer and colonize the world with their gunboat policy. Now the Americans go one step further: they have even established theIn actual fact, China lagged behind the west only in the last 300 years or so.Even in the seven great voyages of exploration by admiral Zheng He 600 years ago all the way to Africa, his treasure ships were very much bigger than Columbus' small vessels:Scale models of Zheng He's ship compared to Columbus's vessel.And, while European sailors in those days were plagued by scurvy (a disease caused by a lack of vitamin C), it was never a problem in Admiral Zheng He's fleet, because the Chinese grew vegetables (and fruits?) on their ships. Historically, Chinese might not be the greatest theorists, but they were great observers of phenomena and they made good use of their observations in daily life. And we should note that they have today placed both theory and practice in relative importance.As mentioned earlier on the First Industrial Revolution, which used water and steam power to mechanize production, the westerners fully capitalized on it. The Second used electric power to create mass production. The Third used electronics and information technology to automate production. The Chinese lost out to the westerners and the Japanese on all these counts. But in this coming Fourth Industrial Revolution, which is characterized by a fusion of technologies that is blurring the lines between the physical, digital, and biological spheres, China is seen ready to grasp the opportunity and compete with the rest of the world to be the top runner. And chances are that they will be the top runner. But being an ethnic Chinese myself, I know China will share her fruits of achievement with the world at large.",0 followers,Priyan Bopitiya,4.7K,269,7.2M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Are-computers-making-airline-pilots-obsolete-Computers-might-be-better-than-pilots-in-most-situations-If-pilots-are-better-in-a-few-cases-the-risk-might-be-acceptable-A-ground-based-pilot-could-take-over-a-plane-remotely-in-emergency-situations
