Such a label could be attached to clothing or in items the person normally carries around. Essentially enough information if the person has na accident or is taken ill.

3,"The goal for self-driving cars is level 5 autonomy, which will require no human intervention. Even at level 4, autonomous cars will be required to be able to safely take themselves off the road if they can no longer cope. Note that with full autonomy, it is explicitly expected that you’ll have vehicle occupants who are incapable of intervening in the driving function of the car (for example, a blind person, or a child).There is concern the level 1–3 self driving cars may rely too much on the unreliable human driver as a backup, and are thus a bad idea.Self-driving car - Wikipedia",3 followers,Steve Baker,514,27.4K,163.3M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-emerging-technologies-will-be-used-to-help-the-elderly-and-handicapped-to-live-better-lives

5,"Actual, full self driving cars, won’t have humans take over in moments of emergency. By the time self driving systems are that advanced, they will likely be better at evasive maneuvers than any human.There are defined levels of self driving, and none really involve your situation.Level 1:Driver assistance (parking, accident avoidance or alert, etc).

By the time self driving systems are that advanced, they will likely be better at evasive maneuvers than any human.There are defined levels of self driving, and none really involve your situation.Level 1:Driver assistance (parking, accident avoidance or alert, etc). Most new cars are now Level 1, except at the budget price ranges.Level 2:Car in full control during limited or controlled situations, while the human driver remains ready to take over in emergency situations. This generally means highway driving where all traffic flows together and there is no stop signs or lights, cross traffic, or poorly marked roads. Tesla Autopilot, GM Supercruise, and a few other systems that have recently emerged, are now Level 2.Level 3:Car is able to handle most normal situations. Car understands road signage, and is able to obey laws and posted signs. The car understands intersections and cross traffic, and can handle surface roads, even with stop signs or stop lights. No consumer available car is Level 3 currently. Level 3 is what I interpret as the “full self driving feature complete” that Elon Musk saying Tesla will have by the end of the year. Like Level 2, Level 3 still requires a human driver to be licensed, alert, and ready to intervene in cases of both emergencies and poorly marked roads or other unclear situations, which Level 3 will likely not handle. Here is where your scenario might occur, but at this point, self driving will still be an optional mode, and drivers trying to learn will be able to bypass the self driving and gain the necessary practice.Level 4:At Level 4, the car still has human controls, but they are mostly a formality. The car will be able to make judgement calls on unclear situations, and will likely outperform any human in emergency situations. Level 4 is the point at which we could begin to consider allowing regulations where a responsible human is not required to be present. Literally, when you leave the bar, you are no longer drunk driving, because you are legally not the driver, and are not responsible for the cars’ safe operation. The human controls will still exist, but “just in case”. Once we get here, your situation won’t really happen, because if you own such a car, or rely on ride-sharing of them, then you likely won’t ever be a learner. Learning to drive or being licensed will not be required to use the car. You will have no need of a drivers license, and will never bother with learning to drive.Level 5:At Level 5, Level 4 has been going on long enough that everyone is comfortable with it. Most people are comfortable with the idea that they never need to drive the car. Many people won’t even have a drivers license or know how to operate the car. Most people will stop feeling the need to use the human controls. Little or no human drivers will he left on the road. At this point, two things happen: 1) the human controls will begin to disappear. 2) the self-driving cars will begin to communicate among themselves, coordinating their driving actions with each other using wireless protocols. This will allow traffic management efficiency, and safe operation at higher speeds. Lane changes, merged, and intersections will all be coordinated and timed with increasing precision, allowing traffic to flow smoothly and quickly even with heavy usage.","527,820 followers",Adam D'Angelo,1.1K,990,33.5M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-emerging-technologies-will-be-used-to-help-the-elderly-and-handicapped-to-live-better-lives

Because kids who don’t know shit today have a huge advantage over kids who didn’t know shit back then - a vast array of information at their fingertips. Give you an example, just this past Summer, I saw a car broke down on the side of the road. I pulled over, and it was a couple teenagers. Their car had overheated. Back when I was that age, suburbanite and city kids didn’t know what to do in times like this. Back in 1995, these kids would’ve asked for… depends. Maybe to be driven to the next payphone (and who really misses that?), or maybe if I knew what do do. They asked me if I had a socket set, because all they had were adjustable wrenches. But, by looking this stuff up on their phones, they figured out that the thermostat wasn’t opening, that they could remove it and continue on for the moment, and how to do it. So I wouldn’t be so quick to discredit them.If I had to cite one thing they’re missing out on, it’s a real appreciation of porn. It’s so easy to get to, the stuff that would keep us horny for weeks on end is bland and mundane to them. In my day, you worked with what you had. If you got a hold of a Victoria’s Secret catalog - especially back when they had Stephanie Seymour or Leticia Casta - that’s what you beat it to.

It always hurt me every time ANYBODY said stuff like this to me, because that has never been my intention. Sure, I like my stylish clothing. Sure, I have always been more of a girly-girl than I ever remember my mom being. Sure, I am very determined. Sure, I am very confident. Sure, I can be very energetic. Sure, I was always on the tall side as a child (although, I am around average height now), and both of my parents were on the shorter side when they were growing up (my dad is around average height for a man now, and my mom is only slightly on the shorter side).
