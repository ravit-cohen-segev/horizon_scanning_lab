It also derives from China's huge domestic demand market, industrial capacity and satellite positioning capacity, as well as the strong execution power of the government and enterprises. China could easily build roads full of sensors in many areas to help cars get the information they need to practice self-driving technology. I believe that on current trends, China will be the leader in autonomous driving technology, and in turn, China's road construction will see another upgrade.In-atmosphere flight technology and underwater navigation technology. China currently has the most powerful wind tunnel technology in the world, which has reached Mach 22. So far, the wind tunnel technology has enabled China to achieve technological breakthroughs in aero-engines, high-temperature protection and hypersonic missiles. I predict that the next step will be reliable hypersonic passenger and cargo aircraft, and even reliable air and space aircraft. Wind tunnel technology can also be used for underwater navigation.Controlled fusion technology. The technology is currently being developed around the world, and China is a leader, having achieved temperatures of 120 million degrees Celsius for more than 10 minutes. The technology, developed and mass-produced, could reduce traditional fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas to chemical feedstocks.

She turned to me and said, “Do you have washing machines in Scotland?” Obviously, I was forced to admit, that no we didn’t. Instead we just went down to the river and bashed our clothes off rocks to clean them.2) Transport - I spent two weeks in the lovely town of Columbia. Missouri. There I amazed the locals with my insistence on using a strange outmoded form of transport known as “walking”. Locals would slow down as they passed in their modern cars, pointing and laughing. To them, it must have been like watching a live action version of the Flintstones.3) Voting – would you believe it, but in the UK we still vote by drawing a little X next to the candidate we want to vote for. No sign of the advanced electronic voting they have over in the states. Indeed, we are so old fashioned that we haven’t even outsourced our voting to the Russians yet!4) Guns – It may be hard for an American to believe but almost nobody in the UK owns their own guns. This means that if we have to rise up and overthrow our own government (currently seems like a good plan) then we will be armed with nothing more than some particularly well sharpened sarcasm.Still, perhaps one day we can hope to be as advanced as the US.

17,"In which areas of advanced military technology is the US behind some other countries?Thank you for the A2A.This is an incredibly difficult question and almost impossible to answer accurately.First of all much of the cutting edge military technology tends to be secret to varying degrees.

By technology we can think of things like “missile technology” or “rocket propulsion technology” etc.I will answer with what comes to my mind and I might miss some things and get others wrong but I’ll try.For instance we have air to air missiles. Europeans are currently developing Meteor missile which reached initial operating capability (IOC) less than a month ago.What is publicly known is that the missile has a ramjet propulsion system and can reach speeds of over 4 mach.According to MBDA, Meteor has three to six times the kinematic performance of current air-air missiles of its type. The key to Meteor's performance is a throttleable ducted rocket (Meteor (missile)Here’s an article claiming that Meteor is in fact the best air to air missile.The Best Air-to-Air Missile in the World Is in Sweden — War Is BoringAssuming this public information is correct and I don’t see why it wouldn’t be - Europeans are ahead of US at the moment with their air to air Meteor missile which was developed over concern for Russia’s R-77 Vympel ramjet missile and according to some sources Meteor missile was built to “wipe the table clear of all opposition”.M777 howitzer is actually designed by BAE (UK).It was immediately widely adopted by US Army and US Marine Corps as well as Canadian Army and Australian Army.The lighter weight and smaller size allows the M777 to be transported by theM777 howitzerAMOS mortar system is joint design by Sweden and Finland.AMOSWhen fitted to a vehicle, bothAMOSGotland class attack submarine originates from Sweden.It is said to be the world’s quietest submarine.TheOn the water surface, the submarine is powered by two sets ofThis capability had previously only been available withGotland-class submarineThe secret to the world’s most silent submarineArcher Artillery System is also from Sweden, it’s dubbed as the world’s fastest howitzer.It uses a Swedish howitzer system that has far superior performance against for instance the M109.The system is designed for high strategic, operational and tactical mobility. The vehicle can reach road-speeds of up to 70Archer Artillery SystemHaubits FH77And this one.. Leopard 2A6. I’m sorry, almost everyone I respect has the authority says it is superior to the beloved Abrams. It’s developed in Germany.It is said that it’s tungsten penetrators have superior accuracy and velocity and superior penetration capabilities due to tungsten’s higher melting point in comparison to depleted uranium.Leopard 2Prathamesh KulkarniIt is the world's fastest anti-shipThe missile travels at speeds ofThe land-launched and ship-launched versions are already in service, with the air and submarine-launched versions currently in the testing phase.An air-launched variant of BrahMos is planned which came out in 2012. ABrahMosThere may be more but I can’t come up with any at the moment, I may update this answer if I have the time and come up with or am recommended new systems and technologies.Things like Electronic Warfare systems etc. are hard to compare, they’re being developed around the world and especially Europe has a very competent high technology cluster that offers a serious rivalry to any US based companies while struggling with but a fraction of the funding that the US ones receive.Luckily for Americans and Europeans we’re all friends and we’ll sell each other anything we can make better than the other - provided they’ll want to buy it that is. Sometimes it is chosen to buy domestic just to support the industry.There are a lot of technologies and systems used by militaries andThey might already be immersed into countless engineering sites online and imagining whole new technologies and solutions.

Supposedly, this technology was used to help cripple the Iraqi air defense system when the US invaded.This was important to Cisco because we were working in security and cryptography and the NSA was forever trying to get us to corrupt our products so they could un-encrypt foreign transmissions on the fly. One time we were required to corrupt product that had been shipped to China and it started a major debate about our fiduciary responsibility to the country or to the customer. The issue was that if you sell a security product that you know is corrupted, you are knowingly committing fraud and are liable. As the Product Manager at the time I asked the NSA if they would stand behind us (and me as I might be personally liable) in court if we were discovered. Of course the answer from the NSA was “Hell no.”We were on our own. We then entered into a long debate about how to detect Easter eggs and other corruption introduced into security products unknowingly through another vendor’s corrupted hardware. The issue was never resolved but it should be known that our security source code HAD to be provided to the NSA in order to get FIPS certification and they made certain changes to it.So to answer your question, USA military technology is advanced far beyond anyone’s knowledge to describe the extent.On the other hand, the Chinese probably know more about our technology than we do since they perpetrated the greatest security breach in history by compromising the RSA key technology used by almost everyone in the world.
