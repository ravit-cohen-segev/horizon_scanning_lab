But 3D printing titanium at this level is absolutely incredible. I have literally no idea how that works to such a degree of reliability a company like Bugatti uses it.

He knew crude attacks wouldn't work, because people just don’t want to watch pictures of rats while someone rants about Jewish inferiority, which is allGoebbels realised that something more subtle was required, something that got across its antisemitic messages but with an engaging story and popular appeal.Which resulted inWhat?

It’s just fiction after all.Not so fast. Ask yourself, do people decide what they think about Jews by reading White Papers and statistical reports?No. One fictional portrayal of a dirty Jewish schemer defiling ‘our’ women and getting his comeuppance at the hands of ‘us’ trumps a thousand professors producing reports showing that Jews aren’t causing any problems.Fundamentally, this is the logical fallacy ofIt’s for good reason that Goebbels called fiction the “vanguard of the Nazi military”.And, finally, you think this doesn’t happen any more?Ask yourself which countries the bad guys are from in the movies you watch.Then ask yourself what you know about those countries that","6,464 followers",Michael Soareverix,509,373,6.6M,2018,https://www.quora.com/If-fiction-can-depict-numerous-forms-of-advanced-technology-why-cant-scientists-create-them-today

Because fully devNo.Online you might find many Chinese brag about this:And thisThen they exclaim, that there are more skyscrapers, high speed trains, etc. in China than America, so they are developed.This is not the right definition of ‘developed’You don’t measure a city or country by outer appearance alone. The thing is we have to take a look at the innards of a country to really know whether or not you are truly developed. That Chinese are so obsessed with portraying the facade that they are technologically advanced and ahead is actually an indication that they have not fully developed yet. Because fully developed countries have no need to show off things like that. Everyone knows they are developed.For example, here is San Francisco:Look, not many skyscrapers right? And look at those old cable cars going around! That must mean they are undeveloped right? Nope. Everyone knows San Francisco is a developed city. That’s why it has no need to show off with luxury skyscrapers and such things.Or how about Florence, Italy?Again, no skyscrapers here. But everyone knows it’s a developed city and Italy is a developed country.My point is, you have got to look at the people and the innards of a country to truly know if they are developed.This is the true face of China:You have got to look at the average person. Does the average Chinese have good access to healthcare (which is ranked near the bottom in WHO rankings btw)? Can they drink tap water safely? Do they have access to quality food? Do all have access to electricity or paved roads or a quality education? The answer is: probably, yes, if you are living in the rich east coast provinces of Jiangsu or Zhejiang or Guangdong- but not if you are living in say - Xinjiang or Gansu or Tibet. China’s wealth is not spread equally, neither is it developed equally. Even though the CCP has developed China quite fast - there is still a lot of work to be done making sure *every Chinese* have equal access to everything.And then you got to look at the attitude of the people. When I was in China I found that you really got to look out for who you trust, because there is a lot of scams going on all the time. You never know what is real, what is fake, what is real price of anything. Why do these scams exist? Because people have to be desperate to make money that’s why.Why are people desperate to make money? Probably because they are not making enough to survive, which is an indication that the country is still developing. You’ll notice that in general, the more developed a country is, the less likely there will be scams. In Korea/Japan/Taiwan, you will not find very many scams. In China and Eastern Europe it’s likely.Another aside I want to note is that Chinese bathrooms don’t contain any toilet paper. Do you know the reason why? It’s because people steal it. Now, in what developed country does this happen? I can’t think of any. Only in a developing country would you need to bring your own toilet paper to the bathroom because there isn’t any there due to fear of people stealing it.I find GDP/capita to be generally a pretty good indicator of how developed a country is. The average GDP/capita (PPP) of China is still around $8k/person. While that is higher than most Asian countries - it’s still below the 4 East Asian tigers + Japan and far from the $62k/person that the USA has.The true measure of a developed society is to observe the people that live in the country and not the appearance of the country itself. Chinese “face” culture is the same. You can just obviously see that China has developed really really fast, and mentality wise people are still harping about luxury products and consumerism - this is where Americans were back in the 50s, 60s and 70s, not now.The biggest consumers of luxury products are Chinese people, not Americans or Europeans. The more developed you are, the less need you have to validate your self worth with materialism. The less desire you have to spend thousands of dollars on your children's schooling just to send them to be educated abroad. The less need to travel to countries like Canada or USA for giving birth so that your child becomes a US or Canadian citizen, or to launder your money by buying up real estate in other countries. Developed countries do not need to do things like that.Thats why you should always pay attention to the old adage -Edit:Of course, Chinese commenters love to bring up the USA. Yes, USA has lots of impoverished areas too; every country has developed areas and undeveloped areas, however my point is that for China there is significantly more undeveloped areas at a higher % compared to the USA. The poverty rate for China is 16% as of 2019 and for USA it is 1.5% as of 2019.

21,"Japan started the war with the best operational fighter in the Pacific - the Mitsubishi Zero.

Their effectiveness diminished when allied fighter pilots learned to use hit and run tactics rather than dog fighting, however, the reality wasJapan started the war with the best operational fighter in the Pacific - the Mitsubishi Zero.

Their effectiveness diminished when allied fighter pilots learned to use hit and run tactics rather than dog fighting, however, the reality was the 1942 versions of allied fighters were slow enough and had limited climb and altitude performance which made the hit and run tactic difficult to use. Also it’s use was problematic when escorting bombers.US P-40US P-39Almost a year to the day after Pearl Harbor, the P-38 Lightning was introduced into combat over New Guinea. While it could not dogfight with the Zero or Oscar, it was much faster, had good climb performance, a high ceiling and long range. The tactics that allowed the P-40s and P-39s to survive and sometimes win against the Zeroes and Oscars allows the P-38s to dominate them.P-38 and one of it’s most successful pilots - Charles MacDonald.Within a couple of months the Marines introduced the F-4U Corsair in the Solomons. What the P-38 was to the Army fliers, the F4U was to the Marines.Early F4U CorsairInitially, the number of P-38s and F4Us available for combat was very small, however, the numbers grew throughout 1943 and every new P-38 and F4U squadron resulted in a dramatic increase in the advantage the allies had over the Japanese in the South Pacific.Later in 1943, the P-47 was introduced to the Pacific. Again, it had the same basic advantages over the Japanese of the P-38 and F4U. By August 1943, the Navy introduced the F6F Hellcat to the war. This was significant because it was the first US carrier based fighter to be superior to the Japanese fighters. It enabled the Navy to initiate offensive operations in the Pacific that would have been far more risky had the Navy lacked a carrier borne fighter capable of gaining and holding air superiority.P-47 Thunderbolt (European markings)F6F Hellcat (early version)The Japanese also introduced new fighters in 1943 and upgraded versions of the Zero and Oscar. In all cases the new fighters were inferior to the later generation of US fighters which increased in numbers and also were updated frequently.So, in 1942 the Japanese had the edge in the quality of fighters operational in the Pacific. By the end of that year, the US had introduced a fighter that was better than anything the Japanese had. In 1943, the US introduced 3 more fighters that were clearly superior to the Japanese fighters. The number and effectiveness of these fighters increased throughout 1943.It is not a coincidence that the timing of when the US went from the defensive to the offensive in the Pacific coincided with the timing of the US domination of the air which was only possible with the introduction of the P-38, P-47, F4U and F6F.","17,898 followers",Prasanna Bhalerao,1.4K,9.1K,72.4M,2017,https://www.quora.com/If-fiction-can-depict-numerous-forms-of-advanced-technology-why-cant-scientists-create-them-today
