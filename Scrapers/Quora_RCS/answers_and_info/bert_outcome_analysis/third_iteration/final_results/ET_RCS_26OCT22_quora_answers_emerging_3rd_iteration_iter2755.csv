0,"In a few areas, actually. First is infrastructure. The Chinese planned waaaaaaaaaay ahead while building. That’s why there were ghost cities. The developers built huge communities before they were needed, knowing that large factories were coming soon. Above that is public transportation.

First is infrastructure. The Chinese planned waaaaaaaaaay ahead while building. That’s why there were ghost cities. The developers built huge communities before they were needed, knowing that large factories were coming soon. Above that is public transportation. Smaller cities have buses available that will take you just about everywhere within the city and bigger cities have subways as well as buses. For going between cities and provinces, China has a high speed rail system in place that is more extensive than the American highway system! For example: I lived in a city called Nanjing in China - about 200 miles/300 km from Shanghai. I could take a high speed train from Nanjing to Shanghai in about 1.5 hours!In contrast, I took an Amtrak train from Detroit to Chicago (about 300 miles/480 km) and it took over 8 hours!Another area China wins at is public utilities. They provide electricity, water, and gas for billions of people for very affordable prices! I paid maybe a total of $20 (US) per month for all utility bills, whereas it cost me over $100 in America! Atop of that is wireless technology (which is considered a public utility in China). I paid 100 rmb ($15) monthly for 16 GB of 4G data, with 1000 texts and 500 minutes of talk (which pretty much meant unlimited everything for me). In America I pay $50 a month for my unlimited plan. Yes, the 4G is a little faster, but that may just be because I’m not trying to access the foreign web here…A third area (kinda related to the second) is how the CCP controls markets and prices so everyone can live a comfortable life. I ate a big plate of food at a small restaurant for between 10 and 20 rmb… ($1.25-2.50). The government controls the means of production, so there is plenty of food for everyone!I hope you enjoyed my answer!",167 followers,Tim Brown,806,1.4K,1.7M,2020,https://www.quora.com/How-fast-can-China-develop-advanced-technologies
1,"Like in any country in the world, you can live comfortably in China if you have money. Your money would last longer if you live in third or fourth tier cities, which is actually much bigger and more advanced than most third or fourth tier cities in the west. China’s technology is not more or less advance than the west, but in China, the use of new technology is more wide spread. When I was in China, I haven’t been to a place where I can’t get any mobile data signal, even when I was in the rural areas.",469 followers,Daniel Cohort,11.9K,377,1.2M,2022,https://www.quora.com/How-fast-can-China-develop-advanced-technologies

3,We have many advanced facilities in China which do not exist in other countries such as electronic payment systems; payment by proximity cards; multi-modal stored value transport cards; phone based payment systems using NFC. In Sydney we struggled for over a decade to implement the stored value transit card. It is still incomplete. But the urban train system will finally go ticketless this year. You can use the card on government transport but not private buses or taxis.

11,A lot would depend on who much you studied and practiced before you had to start from scratch. My guess is that 99 of most people could not even start a fire without matches or a lighter. Would you even know how to make a stone axe? Do you know where to find the “correct” type of stone and how to pressure flake an edge and how to make cord from a certain kind of local plant?But if you spend time studying stone age technology and more time practicing and really learning you might be able to re-create a late stone age village where the people lived on both some farming and some hunting.One troubA lot would depend on who much you studied and practiced before you had to start from scratch.

Gathering and hunting food would be a full time job. You would never have time the recreate that village.IN theory one could make cast metal from just ore and charcoal and clay bricks but you’d need to time to set that up but you need to spend your time just getting food and it would take years to create a primitive metal industry.Time is the biggest problem. For example I know how to make a broken oven and cook sourdough break with just flour and water but how long would it take to collect a pound of grass seeds and mill them to four by hand with a flat rock?
