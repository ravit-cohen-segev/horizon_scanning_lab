When I heard the doctor tell her “six months”, it felt likeI met my wife, Jess, twenty-one years ago when she was nineteen.Our parents owned side-by-side cabins in the northern part of New York and we both happened to be along for the week-long hunting trip our fathers planned that year.Jess' father was a skilled hunter and could hit a headshot from a mile away — same as my dad.Jess and I didn't hunt with them — we hung out by the lake.The moment I saw Jess I fell in love. We've been together ever since.But now, now that she has an expiration date, I just don't know what to do — I'm scared and lost.Monday morning at work I was telling my best friend and supervisor, Timmy, about my wife's condition. Timmy told me that I.T. or Intelligent Terrestrial just came out with their latest models.These models are different than those of yesteryear because they are 52% mechanical and 48% biological.Timmy said all you have to do is mail a sample of DNA to I.T. and upload a digital copy of your consciousness through an app. You can then purchase a custom made clone at an age of your choice. When the clone arrives it will turn on, study it's surroundings and await a consciousness download.“Oh my God Timmy, what's the catch?”“The price, Leon.”When I got home from work, Jess and I plugged in and uploaded a digital copy of our entire conscious catalog to I.T. and then mailed off DNA samples.Jess asked me what age I wanted her to be. It felt awkward to say “twenty”, but I did it — I was honest. I miss her smooth, youthful skin and I want her to be young and healthy — especially if I have to cash my entire 401K in to afford it.We told her parents that we were going to basically bring her back from the dead and her father threatened to shoot any abomination that we brought into this world.One month later, on a day that Jess was particularly ill, the doorbell rang.Jess and I dragged the box through the door and laid it on the living room floor. I gently cut along the lines and when I opened the flaps, there,she,was.The last time my heart fluttered like this was the day I met her.Jess helped me lift I.T. out of the box and sit I.T. up.I.T. was warm and soft. I.T. was mine. I paid for I.T. I own I.T.Machines like this don't have rights — even though they are part biological, the governments recognize them in the same way they would a lawnmower — so, as I said, I.T. is my possession.The science behind uploading a digital consciousness is so cutting edge, that the laws just haven't caught up yet.Jess turned I.T. on and I.T. looked right into my eyes. I was in love — with two women, but, it was the same woman. We hadn't uploaded Jess' consciousness yet, so, I.T. was running on basic programming, but I.T. was gorgeous.Jess asked me what I wanted to do, and for the first time in a very long time — I lied to her.I told her we should go shopping and buy I.T. some clothes.I.T. doesn't seem to have a personality yet.“Hello…. Smile…”Jess picked outfits for both of them and we went for a walk through the park together. It was amazing — I was so happy.We walked down a cozy little trail and found a tuck away to sit and talk.I.T. watched and studied every move Jess and I made. I.T. was learning and adapting.I.T. was becoming aware.At one point Jess and I got distracted and I.T. wandered off. When we found I.T., I.T. was gazing at the sky.I asked I.T. what it was doing. I.T. said, “Where do I come from?”“You come from Heaven. You are my angel.”That answer seemed to work for I.T. We all walked back to the car and headed home.When we got home, Jess immediately started coughing. She fell to the ground and I tried to help her, but I didn't know what to do.Jess passed away right then. It was finally over.I called her family and the police. It took an hour for them to remove the body. I had Jess 2.0 sitting in my back room waiting for them to leave.After the police left, I plugged I.T. into my laptop and downloaded Jess' consciousness.After the download was complete, we walked outside and I looked into her gigantic brown eyes. I asked her, “Is it you, Jess?”She smiled and said, “It is, silly — now kiss me.”Her head slammed back. I didn't know if she was glitching or what and then I heard a bang and saw a hole above her left eye.My beautiful Jessica died twice today. I was crushed.Over the next two decades, I fell into a deep, dark, alcohol-fueled depression. Although I had developed a serious alcohol problem, I was able to work and save every single penny I earned.After twenty years of saving, I decided I wanted both of them back — the twenty-year-old Jess and the forty-year-old Jess.I sent my entire life savings off to I.T. and in one month, my doorbell rang.I cut the box open and wept when I saw my angel(s).I turned them on.I also clothed them. The younger version of me may have left them in the nude, but at this age, I just want my companion(s) back.The ladies helped me back to my room to lay down. I was so tired from all the excitement.I've waited and worked an entire lifetime to be with the woman I love. And now, at long last — she is beside me.I died, on that very night as a happy man.One day later, the doorbell rang. It seems my beautiful Jessicas used my direct deposit life insurance benefit to make a purchase.They gently cut the box open.And turned me on.You ask where technology will be in 2050?We will be everywhere.LeonSpecial thanks:Cameron — Dear friend.

It's still a car and does car things.I don't see self-driving cars being important enough in 10 years to have changed our lives much.I think there are two potential areas that relatively new technology will change our lives.One we may be having more and more remote working situations. This very well could change how we live. Right now if you want an engineering job, publishing job or big law job you have to live in an expensive urban area. If you could cut that down to having to go to your office once a week I see two different things happening at once. People can start living farther away which might reduce the cost of living in the heart of a city but it will increase the cost of living farther away and cause smaller areas to have to provide more services to people staying home.The other change I see is automation of low-level low experience jobs. For example right now self-checkouts and online ordering is cutting into the number of cashiers that are being employed. Other than answering questions, much of what happens in a store for example can be automated. The first thing is this eliminates one path for teens to start into the workforce. This automation likely makes it harder for the small business to complete in some ways.","5,360 followers",Valerio Cietto,677,2.4K,9.1M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-are-all-advanced-emerging-technologies-will-be-used-in-future-year-2050

Some because of their data collection heritage can become data providers.Others take up roles in the data supply chain, or position themselves as industry platforms or marketplaces.AI is a primary tech enabler of this ability to scale, but it’s just one enabler.Frank Gens, IDC’s chief scientist, atScaling partnerships will also be a critical factor. The main underlying message here is that collaboration and partnering arrangements with other companies in various parts of this Innovation Graph (the means of digital transformation, or what IDC calls DX) will be critical. No one is going it alone. All will need help, and they’ll need to know how to find that help.Note that the Developers circle is bigger than the industry platform and cloud mega platforms. External developers (centered around the Apache and Linux Foundation open-source software initiatives) will write 80 percent of the code for the ecosystem, even though the top multinationals are certainly doubling or tripling the size of their developer staffs. The Mega Platforms such as Amazon and the Google Compute Cloud + Search now run on 2B of lines of code each. Compare that with tens of thousands of lines of code per mobile app.Cloud platforms are being built for each industry. If the early 2010s was about public and private cloud and the cloud platforms Amazon, Microsoft, Google and IBM have built, the late 2010s will be about the industrial, sector-specific equivalent. GE already offers Predix and its operating system in the manufacturing sector. Predix is the model for other industries. John Deere, Intel, the National Information Technology Center and others are in the process of emulating what GE has done. “By 2020, 75% of G500 companies will be suppliers of digital services through Industry Collaborative Clouds,” Gens thinks.Consultancies will play a digital services information brokering or mediation role in the Innovation Graph. Online retailers offers thousands of different services, with new ones are coming online every month. How does anyone keep track of these? Intermediaries will have to emerge for each industry.New channel partners will also act as intermediaries. Companies who specialize in meeting customer needs in specific vertical niches won’t be going away, but they will be confronting new, digital-savvy entrants.",UNKNOWN,Ben Y.

This would certainly take an year of research and a book to answer with certain defined premises.E.g. Though cell-phones were introduced in 1993–94 in India, they were affordable and proliferated only after the enterprises matured and became savvy in 2004–05. That is like a decade. And realistically, not because India manufactured more phones or more affordable phones but only after Chinese phones penetrated in 2006. Then it became a boom!I will try to keep it brief.Now, how AI impacts businesses and enterprises generally speaking:I leave the rest to your imagination.","284,852 followers",James Altucher,992,878,91.7M,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-are-all-advanced-emerging-technologies-will-be-used-in-future-year-2050

I think AI will kill jobs, and over time, AI might kill most “jobs” as we know them. I think that people are somewhat complacent in regard to the economic impact of AI, and will likely be ill-prepared for the changes we have to adapt to in the not-so-distant future.First, let's start with the comparisons to machinery and automation. They did indeed put factory workers out of work. In that respect, I agree AI today is similar in many applications, replacing workers who have less specialized skills, perhaps call center operators, office assistants (in a limited extent), and maybe soon, taxi drivers and truck drivers. But I would argue that AI is fundamentally different from machinery or most of the other analogies commonly made when answering this question, because AI is growing and is unlikely to stop growing. It's growing in breadth (of applications and industries), in geographic and economic scope, and in power (it's capacity to address increasingly complex tasks). A more fitting analogy would be machinery in an automobile plant that not only made the parts one day, but then learned how to assemble them the week after, and then how to design cars a year later.I think that there is little that is out of reach for advanced AI of the future. Let's leave the question of the AI singularity alone for now. Instead, I think that deep learning efforts at Google and elsewhere are making AI systems learn faster and faster, with a growing rate of acceleration. Advanced AI can now address increasingly complex tasks including medical diagnosis, stock market trading, weather prediction and human behavioral modeling. Very soon, it will be able to take the place of certain types of teachers, and find a role in education. It can already deal with complex systems in software and mathematics, and seems to be only limited in applications that require interactions with the physical world (sensors are still imperfect), and with people.So without projecting too far into the future, we can ask the question, what jobs will NOT be killed by AI? Jobs that involve labor are already (or soon to be) replaced. Jobs that require logical reasoning are being replaced, albeit at a slower rate. What are the qualities that humans have that cannot be captured by AI? Perhaps creativity, emotional responses? So perhaps researchers in academia will survive longer than most, and artists (though AI stylistic mimicry is already quite impressive and their results enjoyable), and counselors/psychologists/case workers, and decision makers like CEOs who cannot be predictable or error prone. And hopefully software engineers and algorithm designers who develop AI systems.This leaves a very, very small portion of today's jobs intact. Many say: we just need to train people to fill higher level jobs created by AI, e.g. Programmers, ML researchers. But this is no easy feat. The US educational system is struggling to meet the demands created by advanced technology today. This failure is in part responsible for the economic divide plaguing the country today. The challenge of educating the public for a job market that is both decreasing in scope and increasing in complexity, is nothing we've ever faced before.I am far from original in this opinion. But if I had to guess, I would say that AI will put far more people out of work than we can (re)train in time. That will have significant economic repercussions as corporations seeking to minimize cost will do so at the cost of rising unemployment. There will need to be dramatic changes in social policies in order to avert large scale economic disaster, first dramatic rises in minimum wage, then eventually some type of universal income/welfare. It's the kind of change that requires significant leadership in our government, something that seems woefully absent today.",35 followers,Noah Green,578,0,0,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-are-all-advanced-emerging-technologies-will-be-used-in-future-year-2050

And, if past is prologue, this technological evolution will lead to dramatic societal changes.Credit image:Advances in technology will usher in the age of the fifth generation, or 5G, telecommunications. And, if past is prologue, this technological evolution will lead to dramatic societal changes.Credit image:We take all this connectivity for granted, but the engineering inside the device in your bag or pocket today would have seemed impossible less than 20 years ago.So, where will 5G take us?This requires a massive increase in the level of connectivity.But the generational change in mobile communications doesn’t just appear overnight. It requires significant effort in research and development and the resources necessary to support that effort. Work on 4G took nearly a decade and the challenges were not easy. Consider one of tens of thousands of problems that needed to be solved as described by an engineer at Qualcomm, where much of this technology was invented.“When the signal leaves the base station, it can undergo a loss of up to 130 decibels before it reaches your mobile phone. To put that loss into perspective, if you consider the transmitted signal power to be roughly the size of the Earth, then the received signal power would be equivalent to the size of a tiny bacteria.”That is a tremendous loss of power, and it requires some pretty impressive engineering to compensate for the effect of the loss on the words, pictures, and other data we send and receive across the airwaves in a transparent, seamless and instantaneous way.Like 3G and 4G, 5G is the responsibility of the standards-setting organisation 3GPP, where the handful of companies that invent technologies come together with many, many more companies who will develop products that implement those technologies.Credit:The benefits and advantages of 5G technology are expected to be available sometime in 2019.Developing nations have rivalled or surpassed their industrialised counterparts in benefiting from the deployment of mobile technology, and there’s every reason to think 5G will have an even bigger levelling effect than its predecessors.Economists estimate the global economic impact of 5G in new goods and services as 5G moves mobile technology from connecting people to people and information, towards connecting people to everything.Many of the benefits probably aren’t yet apparent to us. Wireless network operators initially resisted proposals to give their customers mobile access to the internet, questioning why they would want it. At the dawn of 4G’s adoption, no one could have predicted the new business models that grew on the back of mobile broadband, like Uber, Spotify and Facebook.Hopefully, this answer can explain!OKportal Technology","9,883 followers",Kenzi Mudge,1.8K,1.3K,8.3M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-are-all-advanced-emerging-technologies-will-be-used-in-future-year-2050

The mailbox was a busy, busy thing back in the day.At tax time you had to go to the post office or library to get the forms you needed.

Nobody else could do that; nobody else knew the right phone numbers to call or had all the schedules and super top secret information necessary to book a trip.Favorite TV shows, such as ""The Wizard of Oz"" aired once a year.  You planned around that, and were careful not to schedule anything else for that night.  The kids got home, hurried through homework and an early dinner, took baths and got into their pajamas, and then everyone gathered around the TV.  When the show was over, the kids were ready for bed.
