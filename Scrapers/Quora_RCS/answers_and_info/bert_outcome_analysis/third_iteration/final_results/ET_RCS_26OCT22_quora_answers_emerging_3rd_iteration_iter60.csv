1,"I have a personal bias: I don’t like people who like to talk about themselves too much. To me, it suggests that they are too infatuated with themselves, and also suggests that they are not willing to listen to good advice. IMO, a person who talks little and listens carefully is much more effective because they are more aware of their own shortcomings. Modesty pays if it is genuine.For this reason,I have a personal bias: I don’t like people who like to talk about themselves too much. To me, it suggests that they are too infatuated with themselves, and also suggests that they are not willing to listen to good advice. IMO, a person who talks little and listens carefully is much more effective because they are more aware of their own shortcomings. Modesty pays if it is genuine.For this reason, I believe that Ren Zhengfei of Huawei is a much more effective leader than Jack Ma.Jack Ma started out as a marketer, and never really graduated from that to something else. He loved media attention, and especially loved to be interviewed by the US media, which has always loved billionaires who speak fluent English. Americans love success stories about how a single individual triumphed against all odds to succeed, even if it isn’t true. I believe that this fed his ego in a bad way.In contrast, Ren Zhengfei started his career in the People’s Liberation Army where he learned the value of discipline and organization. I love the way he craves learning, especially from the people who are trying to destroy him. Most recently, this has been the US government’s Commerce Department which has not missed a single opportunity to destroy Huawei, including putting his daughter, Meng Wanzhou, under house arrest in Vancouver for nearly three years. Instead of hating the US government, he has told Huawei employees that they must learn from the US, especially how the US became the leader in so many fields.One particular training method he has used is little-known in the US: it is called the Blue Army. The Blue Army is Huawei’s corporate equivalent of the US military’s aggressor squadron [1] used to train its best pilots in air-to-air combat. Have you heard of any US companies which have something similar to train their employees? I haven’t.In October 2021, Ren ...",0 followers,Lucas Martin,6.4K,65,4.2M,2021,https://www.quora.com/How-does-Jack-Ma-manage-a-top-technology-company-without-being-a-technology-person

3,"Jack Ma was a visionary and consummate “big picture” entrepreneur. Much of his success was selling this vision to his early (as well as later) employees and inspiring them to push on with a “martial spirit”.Jack Ma was neither a details guy nor a technology operator — as he himself would remind the world countless times. But from the beginning, whether it was luck or his own unique charismatic approach, he found and/or attracted the right people to fill these roles.For example, in its early days when Alibaba was nothing more than Jack Ma and an idea, he convinced Joe Tsai to leave a stable, luJack Ma was a visionary and consummate “big picture” entrepreneur. Much of his success was selling this vision to his early (as well as later) employees and inspiring them to push on with a “martial spirit”.Jack Ma was neither a details guy nor a technology operator — as he himself would remind the world countless times. But from the beginning, whether it was luck or his own unique charismatic approach, he found and/or attracted the right people to fill these roles.For example, in its early days when Alibaba was nothing more than Jack Ma and an idea, he convinced Joe Tsai to leave a stable, lucrative job at Investor AB to join the startup. In many ways, Joe was the complete opposite of Jack Ma — educated at a prestigious university, worked for a white-shoe law firm and respected investment firm, Taiwanese vs. mainland Chinese — but he ultimately became one of Jack’s most important and trusted partners and a very strong complement in all aspects of running the day-to-day business as well as helping influence the long-term strategy.Similarly, he also sold his vision to the right investment partners, principally Masayoshi Son at Softbank and Jerry Yang at Yahoo. Although they did not always agree on everything, ultimately they had the long-term horizon to execute on the vision and each benefited massively as a result. Softbank’s investment in Alibaba ranks alongside Nasper’s investment in Tencent among the most successful venture investments of all time.Jack Ma was also generous with equity for his employees. Compared to other Chinese (not to mention many non-Chinese) Internet or technology companies, Alibaba was far more generous with stock options and grants. In some cases, Jack Ma shared equity from his personal ownership with employees instead of the standard practice of diluting everyone to enlarge the employee equity pool.The result was relatively broad stock ownership in Alibaba’s employee base — and the minting of thousands of millionaires before and during the IPOMost of them — like Jack Ma himself — came from very “normal” backgrounds. While they may not have come with the most impressive educational pedigree or work experience, they learned by doing and having a front-row seat to one of the greatest stories in modern capitalism.One thing I have observed (from the outside) is that many in the original core group of Alibaba’s founders/management are still heavily involved with the firm, especially when you compare with other firms in the space. Many of these core group are in senior leadership positions running major parts of Alibaba as it has expanded into new areas over time (e.g. Lucy Peng at Ant Financial).Alibaba employees that have left often do so to pursue their own entrepreneurial ventures but still remain in the wider Alibaba alumni network and eco-system — not dissimilar to the “Paypal Mafia”In summary, besides having the vision and focus, I think the most important things that Jack Ma did to build the company were:Jack Ma has not been involved in day-to-day operations for some time now. Yet Alibaba and its affiliates have continued to evolve and push into new areas (cloud, digital content, O2O, new retail, fintech) and — in my view — executed very well. So from this perspective, I think that the Alibaba management team is strong enough to continue carrying the torch and performing at a high level.Meanwhile, Jack Ma’s role as chief architect of the company’s long-term vision and its most effective spokesperson should continue whether or not he has an official role with the company.",190 followers,Anuj Bhadouriya,901,0,0,2018,https://www.quora.com/How-does-Jack-Ma-manage-a-top-technology-company-without-being-a-technology-person

The amount of patience and emotional control a person needs for this career is admirable. He could have easily brushed it off as a prank call, but his dedication to this woman is inspiring.Sitting on the other side of the phone line, not being able to physically be there in person, but to save someone through your words requires strength.","90,251 followers",Alisha Talks,21.9K,909,103.6M,2020,https://www.quora.com/How-does-Jack-Ma-manage-a-top-technology-company-without-being-a-technology-person
