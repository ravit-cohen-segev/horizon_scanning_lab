All of these topics are usually contained within a typical textbook in anywhere between 50 and 150 pages. Pretty neat, right?The thing is, all of these useful topics, that can be contained within 150 pages, took humankind a couple of centuries to discover and develop. Along the way, multiple papers were published, with approaches that weren’t optimal, or new developments that in the end turned out to not be so relevant, among other things. The neat, short 150 pages textbook is really the result of many, many years (in this case, close to 400) of carefully distilling the essential and most useful features of a topic. So from a narrow-minded perspective, clearly most of the papers written in this topic during that time-period turned out to be useless, because they didn’t make it to today—their contents are largely forgotten by now. However, I think we can agree that having a community of people publishing papers was necessary to ultimately obtain the distilled product. All of the papers were useful, even if their contents didn’t make it to this day, because they are part of something larger, which eventually resulted in our super-useful modern day basic algebra textbooks.Think about a football (and by “football” I really mean, of course, what North Americans like to call “soccer”) match, whose final outcome is team A beating team B by 1–0. How many times was the ball kicked by one of team A’s players? I’d say that that’s a really big number. Would you say that all but one of those kicks were really useless, because they didn’t end up scoring? Of course not!It’s the same for math, or any other scientific discipline for that matter. The researchers of today are building and discovering the textbook material of 100 years from now. Except this involves a lot of trial-and-error. From a narrow perspective, 95% of the papers currently published will turn out to be useless, since their contents will not make it to 100 years from now. But from a wider perspective, all of these papers are necessary, because we cannot know in advance which ones will “make it”, but also because the whole development of the subject requires a community of people trying out many different ideas in constant dialogue with each other.","1,029 followers",David Fernández-Bretón,7.1K,299,850.4K,2017,https://www.quora.com/Is-Elon-Musk-right-in-saying-most-academic-papers-are-useless

3,"Yes, and probably more. Why so? Because the goal pursued by most of the authors is to write a paper that gets accepted for publication, not necessarily to do something useful (many wouldn't know what's useful and what's not). If they write a really good paper with great results, and the reviewers happen to like it, then maybe just maybe the publication would be useful. But this usually only becomes clear later.

Perhaps Elon, and the likes of him, aren’t as smart as they think they are.The ability to organize thoughts, carry out research, document findings, and even publish those findings, are all critical to the advancement of mankind. Nearly 100% of the technology Elon is working on has come from reading books, published by those where college research was the catalyst (Elon said that’s how he learned about rockets). Moreover, college graduates eventually become employees. Competent employees working in STEM should be able to read and write at a college level.I honestly can’t believe the idiocy of this era.The objective of academic research is producing more research, in hopes that something valuable will emerge from the process. And, guess what? It eventually does. Thus, most academic papers are not useless, as progress and research are inseparable.The truth is, when Elon says that academic papers are useless, what he really means is useless to him, because he cannot make money from the content of the papers. Elon links academic research, to profit. Anything outside of profit, he cannot understand.

Musk’s penchant for soundbites and short tweets makes his reasoning seem naive and lacking in nuance, which is a sign of someone thinking they know more than they really do.This statement made by Elon Musk shows that he misunderstands the various different purposes of publishing papers and that he has a narrow-minded view of research. One reason to publish is of course to push the state-of-the-art and to make contributions that are useful to humanity. These are the papers than Musk would refer to as ‘useful’. However, it is hard to know beforehand which papers are useful since it might take time to digest those findings, or to integrate them with other ideas, or for the technology to catch up, etc. Sure, there are some papers which are obviously useful right away, but only limiting scholars to publishing these kinds of papers would be a disaster for mankind because we would miss on ideas whose time may not yet have come. I’m glad Musk is not in charge of running research divisions.Secondly, Musk stance on only publishing ‘useful’ papers would degrade the quality of researchers being trained/produced. Publishing papers teaches new researchers how to write up their findings in a coherent manner, how to navigate peer-review, how to conduct literature surveys, the culture of academic publishing, etc. Publishing papers is how a PhD students graduate, because it shows they have the skills to be independent researchers. A PhD is a researcher’s first ever serious research project, so it is foolish to expect it to always be great and ‘useful’. However, publishing these papers is how we maintain the pipeline of future researchers, which Musk and all other high-tech companies rely on for their technological advancements. An academic system that only publishes ‘useful’ papers (like Musk wants) would be against his own interests, which shows just how little Musk understands about research.

In many cases, they are dressed-up non-novel opinion pieces. In other cases, unverifiable or nonreplicable. It’s knowledge churn without learning or discovery. For many people, that process has become a kind of credential farm—but which generates little or nor socially useful skills. (And it uses a lot of resources to do that.)And—relevant to what he was saying—he didn’t want to do that with his life.When talking about the success of his ideas and why he went the route of commercialization (circa 1995) as opposed to completing grad school at Stanford, Musk meant that it was good to have some idea in mind for what success is. That is, to have some notion of having accomplished your goals—and success can be very different depending on what you’re doing.In academia, that would been easy to succeed because describing that some theory doesn’t work is still “success”. But, it’s not success in terms of addressing the problems he wanted to address. And if he would’ve just gone the research route, his work would’ve ended up in some journal, probably no one would’ve eve read it, and that he thought his time would’ve been wasted.Watch the original segment from 4:25–10:00.

However, after getting this degree through all of my hard work, it’s here where I realized that I’m still on the lower totem pole compared to others with their education also. So in that regard my papers were useless. I mean, how much education is enough? How many years do I have to keep spending in school? How far in student loans debt do I have to put myself into?Where papers do become important though is once you do get that call and interview for employment, when they ask for proof of education, you’ll have it to show.On the grand scheme of things, a person doesn’t need to be educated in order to find success. However, they would have to have one hell of an idea, a shit ton of drive, a lot of luck, and most importantly, money, and lots of time to find success. They would have to work for themselves, as nobody is looking to hire anyone without at the very least a high school diploma. The problem with all of these things is they’re incredibly difficult to line up all at the same time.It’s easy for a billionaire to say someone doesn’t need education, but he’s basing his assessment from his experiences and his point of views. He’s not in the rest of the worlds shoes. Some of us are just getting by. Some of us are living paycheque to paycheque, some of us are just stuck. It’s not like we want to be in this situation either.His comment is a double edged sword. A part of me understands the comment, but in some ways I feel he’s wrong, and in others I feel he’s right. Elon hasn’t had to struggle like a lot of us do in our everyday life for a long time. When Elon was struggling financially, he’s nowhere near what he is today, it was a much different time.Long story short, what worked for Elon, doesn’t translate into working for everyone else. I’d also like to add that it’s fun and all to make those kind of outrageous claims where people don’t need education in order to be successful, and that colleges and universities are a waste of money and time, then if that’s the case offer a solution, or better yet, create some type of program that will allow others to find more success then, seeing as he has everything figured out. Better yet, how about he hires all uneducated people for new companies and divisions? Let’s see how well these people do. Something tells me he’s not willing to bet his company on uneducated people.","29,970 followers",Tomaž Vargazon,1.7K,7.7K,249.9M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Is-Elon-Musk-right-in-saying-most-academic-papers-are-useless

Specifically, Jonathan's career progressed in the following order:A bit about Jonathan:Jonathan is currently Director of Data Science and Analytics at Intuit. He co-founded Level Up Analytics, a premier data science consulting company focused on data science, big data and analytics which Intuit acquired in 2013. From 2006–09 he led the product analytics team at LinkedIn which was responsible for creating new data-driven products. While at LinkedIn he invented the “People You May Know” product and algorithm which was directly responsible for getting millions of users connected and more engaged with LinkedIn.He received a Ph.D. in physics in 2005 from Stanford where he worked on quantum computing and a B.S. in physics from MIT.On Jonathan's Transition from Bachelors to PhD to Consultant at AccentureJonathan finished his Bachelors in Physics from MIT. He wasn't quite sure what to do with his future afterwards, so he applied to PhD programs. Slowly, he realized that the academia life was not for him. He joined Accenture as an analyst, as he was interested in energy and didn't want to do a postdoc.I completed my Bachelors in Physics at MIT.I also applied for a few jobs, but was just not excited about any of the jobs I saw, and how they would leverage my skills. In comparison, grad school was exciting since I would get to work on fundamental research there. At the time, I was really excited about what was happening in the world of quantum computing.I got into Stanford, and I found an advisor who was specifically working on quantum computing. So I came out to Stanford and liked it for a while, but towards the later part of my Ph.D. recognized I wanted to something else.The parts of the Ph.D. program I loved most were when I was actually getting the data, analyzing it, and iterating very fast. I had these experiments I'd have to run for 30 hours, and basically after that, the system would shut down, restart my experiment, and it would take a day or two to get the system to reset. It was during this period that I was getting this amazing data, make a hypothesis then and test it. I loved the actual thinking, the theoretical aspects of it, what that told me to do with the experiment, and what parameters to explore.Towards the end of my program, I got involved in some entrepreneurship activities at Stanford. I got involved in this organization called a nanotechnology forum, where Steve Chu, Stanford physics professor and later the Secretary of Energy came to speak. A lot was happening back in the early 2000s in that area. I was trying to go into that area, looking at solar energy technologies -- I was very excited about that. But then I looked at a few of the solar technology companies, and the basic approach that they had was,At the end of graduate school, I was looking for a job, and I knew at that point I just did not want to stay and do a postdoc. I ended up going to the consulting firm Accenture, and I was excited about going to work in energy.So, I was working for a little while on natural gas strategy for one of the partners, and that was fun. I got put on a project to work at a utility company, and it was good to get that exposure -- to find out what the corporate world is like. What is it like to do consulting? What’s it like to work in this company? How do they operate? I actually learned a lot about how to communicate and how they work; it’s such a different world from academia.On Jonathan's Transition from Accenture to LinkedInJonathan left Accenture looking for a more technical role, and was blown away by the people and the data at LinkedIn.At that point where I was thinking,Why Jonathan Found LinkedIn AwesomeJonathan transitioned to being one of the first data scientists at LinkedIn, and was one of the original creators of LinkedIn's now famousWell, what really excited me was thinking,The data was all there, and I could ask questions about the data very quickly. It was exactly the part of the Ph.D. program that I liked. Suddenly I didn't have to deal with the experimental apparatus which took me two years to build. It was like, boom, I have the data, and it's actually very interesting. I was learning all these new techniques and it was great.Within two weeks of starting, I had already felt that this was my dream job.On Jonathan's Transition from LinkedIn to Data Science Consulting to IntuitAfter his tenure at LinkedIn,The three of us saw this opportunity -- the demand for data science and building technology that would help solve data science problems. We saw a huge need that was just constant, and thought we could build a premier consulting firm and we would go to these companies and help them transform their businesses, while hiring people that we really liked working with.The amazing thing was that we were able to get really good talent, get really good clients, and work on really challenging problems. There weren’t that many people doing exactly what we were doing -- no-one else did the full end-to-end, including “What’s the business problem you’re facing? Where’s the place we can have the most impact? What technology might need to be built or deployed? What algorithms and analysis need to be done? We could do the full stack -- I think a lot of companies really liked that approach.This is an excerpt from Jonathan's full interview in the",UNKNOWN,DataCamp,10.5K,0,0,2021,https://www.quora.com/Is-Elon-Musk-right-in-saying-most-academic-papers-are-useless

Otherwise we're responsible for all damages, can lose our license, and can be majorly sued for reckless endangerment of a patient regardless of if the patient sustains further injuries or not.Ive seen it happen where an ambulance got run through by a semi as they were crossing through an intersection. They were transporting a cardiac arrest patient, did everything I said, but didn't anticipate a semi to go through the turn lane at 50 mph to bypass the people stopped at a green light. The ambulance got t-boned and flipped onto its side, the driver had to be helicoptered out due to massive injuries and blood loss, the tech got out with just a broken arm, dislocated shoulder, and a massive concussion, but the patient didn't make it.The semi driver wasn't badly hurt, but he was found at fault and convicted of reckless endangerment, and was ordered to pay for all medical expenses incurred as well as replacement of the ambulance as it was totaled. I feel bad for the guy since the total came out to be over a hundred thousand dollars but it was my friends who got hit so I don't feel too bad.Sorry for giving you more than you asked, but it all boils down to the fact that it's so much easier to move out of the way if you can.
