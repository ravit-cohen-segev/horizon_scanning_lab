It's already a soulless cesspool of bad ideas and giant egos. It's also ugly. The natural setting (if you drive about an hour away from everything created by humans) of Northern California is gorgeous but the inhabitants have not been kind to it, which is why it looks like one giant strip mall.Okay, so that's the short-term answer.

1,"Interesting question Michael. I’m not sure if it will look more like Detroit does now than when it was in its Fordist heyday in the 1910s and 192os. Detroit, like the valley, has and had more than one excellent educational institution nearby such as the University of Michigan and Wayne State University, whereas San Jose and nearby Palo Alto has Stanford University, Santa Clara University among several others.The very high cost of finding a place to live within the finite limits of Valley area cities will act as a driver for geographical diversification especially as technologies such as 3D PriInteresting question Michael. I’m not sure if it will look more like Detroit does now than when it was in its Fordist heyday in the 1910s and 192os. Detroit, like the valley, has and had more than one excellent educational institution nearby such as the University of Michigan and Wayne State University, whereas San Jose and nearby Palo Alto has Stanford University, Santa Clara University among several others.The very high cost of finding a place to live within the finite limits of Valley area cities will act as a driver for geographical diversification especially as technologies such as 3D Printing, which is becoming a subset of Nanotechnology Manufacturing, has considerably lower funding barriers to entry than former manufacturing models required.As women become a predominant factor in chosing careers over families, suburbs and their better funded school systems will modulate their demographic profiles to smaller family units of one or two children with parents mostly in their very late 20s and older even up to their 60s depending on how the safety of women having children safely after 40 vastly improves.Cool cities for younger adults will continue to be like Chicago, Toronto, Munich, and Atlanta, but in smaller sized cities like Ann Arbor and Providence, R.I. or even large towns. I’m not familiar with many more that should be on that list, but university and leading edge research areas like Chapel Hill and Durham, N.C. would seem to attract the legions of younger adults with advanced educations (and student loans) who will be attracted to such areas and increasingly be involved in reducing or canceling their outstanding financial debts that will put them big time back into turning the real estate market on its head and pulling tens of thousands of construction workers to booming areas like North Dakota, but for reasons of a pleasing perceived lifestyle and not scale oil.I should add that because we are only now trying to develop initial road maps for the diffusion of certain emerging technologies like DNA-NT manufacturing, one should keep watch on the progress of our tools for tracking technological paradigm shifts in these areas in assessing how they will impact on significant, traditional geographical demographic shifts.","67,116 followers",Auren Hoffman,813,699,23.4M,2016,https://www.quora.com/Will-Silicon-Valley-still-be-the-center-of-technology-and-innovation-in-the-next-hundred-years

5,"Development HistoryThe LED made by applying the principle of semiconductor P·N junction light source came out in the early 1960s. In 1964, the red light emitting diode appeared first, and then the yellow LED appeared. It was not until 1994 that blue and green LEDs were successfully developed. In 1996, the white LED was successfully developed by Nichia Corporation of Japan (Nichia).With its inherent characteristics, such as power saving, long life, vibration resistance, fast response speed, and cold light source, LEDs are widely used in indicator lights, signal lights, display screens, landscapDevelopment HistoryThe LED made by applying the principle of semiconductor P·N junction light source came out in the early 1960s.

In 1996, the white LED was successfully developed by Nichia Corporation of Japan (Nichia).With its inherent characteristics, such as power saving, long life, vibration resistance, fast response speed, and cold light source, LEDs are widely used in indicator lights, signal lights, display screens, landscape lighting and other fields, and can be seen everywhere in our daily life. , Household appliances, telephones, instrument panel lighting, automotive anti-fog lights, traffic lights, etc. However, due to the limitation of its poor brightness and high price, it cannot be popularized and applied as a general light source.In recent years, with the continuous deepening of research on semiconductor light-emitting materials, the continuous progress of LED manufacturing process and the development and application of new materials (nitride crystals and phosphors), breakthroughs have been made in ultra-high brightness LEDs of various colors. With progress, its luminous efficiency has increased by nearly 1000 times, and all colors in the visible light band have been realized in terms of chromaticity. The most important thing is the emergence of ultra-high brightness white light LEDs, which makes it possible for LED applications to leap into the high-efficiency lighting source market. Someone once pointed out that high-brightness LED will be one of the greatest inventions of mankind after Edison invented the incandescent light bulb.advantage:High energy-saving: energy-saving energy without pollution is environmental protection. DC drive, ultra-low power consumption (single tube 0.03-0.06 watts) electro-optical power conversion is high, the same lighting effect is more energy-saving than traditional light sources.Long life: The LED light source is called a longevity lamp, which means a lamp that never goes out. Solid cold light source, epoxy resin encapsulation, no loose parts in the lamp body, no shortcomings such as easy burning of filament, thermal deposition, light decay, etc. The service life can reach 60,000 to 100,000 hours, which is 10 times longer than traditional light sources above.Changeable: LED light source can use the principle of red, green and blue three primary colors, under the control of computer technology, the three colors can have 256 gray levels and can be mixed arbitrarily, which can generate 256×256×256=16777216 colors, forming different lights. The combination of colors is varied to achieve a variety of dynamic changing effects and various images.Environmental protection: the environmental protection benefits are better, there is no ultraviolet and infrared light in the spectrum, neither heat nor radiation, and the waste is recyclable, no pollution, no mercury element, cold light source, can be touched safely, it is a typical green lighting source.High-tech tip: Compared with the monotonous luminous effect of traditional light sources, LED light sources are low-voltage microelectronic products that successfully integrate computer technology, network communication technology, image processing technology, embedded control technology, etc., so they are also digital information products. The ""high-tech"" technology of semiconductor optoelectronic devices has the characteristics of online programming, unlimited upgrades, and flexibility.Someone once pointed out that high-brightness LED will be one of the greatest inventions of mankind after Edison invented the incandescent light bulb. Then the lighting technology after LED must first transition from high brightness to ultra-high brightness.",403 followers,Theo Schmit,3.8K,174,928.9K,2022,https://www.quora.com/Will-Silicon-Valley-still-be-the-center-of-technology-and-innovation-in-the-next-hundred-years

It is more difficult to achieve than the classic fully immersive virtual reality, or VR, where all you see are synthetic images, and in many ways MR is the more powerful of the two technologies.A mind bending as well as a game changing technology of the next decade.Image Courtesy :","246,825 followers",Dushka Zapata,1.5K,8.5K,232.3M,2016,https://www.quora.com/Will-Silicon-Valley-still-be-the-center-of-technology-and-innovation-in-the-next-hundred-years
