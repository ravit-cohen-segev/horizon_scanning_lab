There are many queens in the world, like the wonderful Queen Margherita of Denmark who is celebrating her Golden Jubilee this year. However when ever anyone in the world said ‘The Queen’, you know they meant HM Queen Elizabeth II. She was also the most travelled sovereign in the world, and not to just Commonwealth countries.This wonderful lady was a huge gift given by God to the whole world.",0 followers,Patricia Bromley,1.2K,7.6K,18.7M,2022,https://www.quora.com/How-much-did-technology-evolve-during-the-reign-of-Queen-Elizabeth-II

2,"The convention and principle in place since 1707, as suggested by Churchill in 1953, is to take the higher number between England back to 1066 and Scotland’s regnal numbering. It’s not in law, but would probably be the recommendation of the Accession Council, as it was for the current Queen. Thus another James would be James VIII, a Robert would be IV, David III, etc… Though, there would no doubt be the same complaints in England about those as there were in Scotland for Elizabeth II.As to the rest of the realms, they inherited the regnal history of the UK.As to use of the I (first), while somThe convention and principle in place since 1707, as suggested by Churchill in 1953, is to take the higher number between England back to 1066 and Scotland’s regnal numbering.

(Due to the nature of her reign, it is unlikely there would ever be a Victoria II, but it could happen.)

Now, I would understand someone saying he’s already an A-lister but tbh, I would say out of him, Dick, Jason, and Damian he’s the least used in movies, shows, and least known.Batman himself said that he was smart as he was and Ra’s Al Ghul called him detective- something he only called Bruce.It also hasn’t helped his popularity that DC pulled a Marvel and made him gay, contrast to every other form of him we have seen (not that he’s gay is the problem but the fact that he was suddenly changed to become gay when he never showed those signs before).In my opinion, he is the perfect ROBIN because although Dick Grayson is a better character, he has been best shown in a commanding role as Nightwing while Tim Drake perfectly compliments Batman as ROBIN.These are the only two I can name off the top of my head.

Once in a great while, a photon of one is absorbed as heat. The amount of heat is so tiny that, unless you like to climb military radars for a living, your body will never notice, much less adapt, much less die early and contribute to evolution.But it does beg the question, how much of that sort of radiation—the kind that can harm living things and drive evolution—do you think is normal?Right now, February 4th, 2021, a government-run, Internet-connected Geiger counter not too far from where I’m standing is measuring not quite 3,000 gamma ray photons per minute. That’s pretty low, and tells me its measuring the air and that, for example I’m not standing right by it. My body (and yours) generates that many gamma ray photons every few seconds just from the decay of trace amounts of radioactive potassium in my bones, left over from the supernova that made all the heavy elements that formed the Earth.Some of those elements—uranium, for example—exist in the granite of my kitchen countertop, and I know from direct measurement that it’s about four times as “radioactive” as the background where I’m standing, or about twice as “radioactive” as say, me.But that’s nothing. There are places in Iran, Brazil, and India, where the soils are so rich in thorium the locals are exposed to ten times as much radiation as I am when I go in the kitchen in my underwear to cook eggs. That radiation does enter the bodies of people in those areas and it does damage there cells—we know this because the body’s cellular radiation repair machinery leave detectable traces, and they tell us people in these areas are busy at work repairing radiation damage.But you know what we don’t see? In these people chronically exposed to ten times the radiation as the rest of us? Nothing. They don’t have higher rates of cancer or anything else that we can detect…so that pretty much garantees the rest us should just chill the hell out about nuclear power already and accept it’s vital role in getting rid of coal—which kills hundreds of thousands of people per year and oh, by they way, is the single biggest source of radioactive radon gas for most people—are very real and measurable cause of cancer.But all of this is nothing. All this background radiation, the potassium in our bones, the uranium in our countertops, the thorium in our soils—it’s all still with use because it has a half life measured in billions of years.
