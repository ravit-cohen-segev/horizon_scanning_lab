3,"New fields in science depend on much the same factors as new developments in commerce: chance, opportunity, means, need (demand). As Pasteur once said, “Chance favors the prepared mind”. What knowledge one has, or humanity possesses, predisposes to questions that lead to thoughts and acts that often advance knowledge by a short step, but sometimes result not in just a leap, but in a sudden clearing of the bush that obstructs the view onto a completely new path.

As Pasteur once said, “Chance favors the prepared mind”. What knowledge one has, or humanity possesses, predisposes to questions that lead to thoughts and acts that often advance knowledge by a short step, but sometimes result not in just a leap, but in a sudden clearing of the bush that obstructs the view onto a completely new path. That, of course, is the element of chance, of a sudden insight, an Archimedean “Eureka!” moment, that cannot be foreseen, though it is often retrospectively traced back to some prior foundation (e.g. Newton’s mythical apple). The important aspect here is the need for the prior preparation, the acquisition of existing knowledge, because without it, one cannot know what one does not know, nor what questions may be asked, or how. Equally important, however, is an openness of mind that does not allow authority, preconception (or pride) or bias to affect one’s thinking, the ability to analyze and integrate based on fact and reality rather than opinion and fancy. Opportunity and means are essential, because without access to a situation and the means to investigate and experiment, nothing can be confirmed (here, mathematicians have an advantage: unlike others they indeed have ""Omnia mea mecum porto""; Bias of Priene). And need prompts answers, “Mater artium necessitas” (need is the mother of invention). However, the “need” here is predominantly intellectual, based on curiosity and a desire to find answers to fundamental questions, and to control fundamental processes, rather than to respond to a current, existential demand. Also, the question is somewhat misleading, because “new fields” these days generally mean a fragmentation of one older field into various splinter fields. Once, for instance, there were “dentists” or “surgeons”, or even “physicians”. Now, there are specialists e.g. endodontists, periodontists, orthodontists, etc., as well as ophthalmologists, pediatricians, cardiologists, proctologists, etc., (or chemical engineers, civil engineers, software and hardware engineers, etc.) each one a “field” of practice, but also a science with its own questions and answers. Still, perhaps the best way to approach a consideration of new fields may be through the “need” of filling existing holes in our knowledge. In that, there is a whole net of holes, not just a few holes, and many major holes. For instance, we seem to have accepted the occurrence of a “big bang” that started our universe some 14 billion years ago, but the concept of a single event, without precedent or company, is a bizarre notion, as are the seemingly irreconcilable notions of relativity on the macro scale and quantum events on the ultra micro scale. Perhaps we may have a new field that postulates a universal energy flow that manifests itself as virtual quantum particles (wavicles) at one end of the scale and “big bangs” on the macro scale. A “philosopher’s stone” had been the goal of alchemists, and transmutation of elements has been achieved at a great cost in energy, but humanity needs access to a large, clean source of energy. Perhaps such an energy source exists at the quantum level, in the same realm that generates the virtual particles, and if the quantum effects could be not merely calculated but understood, then maybe a new field might open; or open because the understanding dawned. In a different domain, that of biology, there has been much progress and many “breakthroughs”, but the complex processes that establish and sustain life, and their interactions, rather than the objects that contain the codes (genes) or contain the machinery (e.g. the mitochondria, the membranes, etc.), are still poorly understood, especially in their relationships and control. What determines (counts to, other than the observed chopping of DNA: quis custodiet, indeed) the Hayflick limit, and what needs to be affected to change that limit without a loss of control? Perhaps a field of cellular control, or cellular interactions, will emerge, and aid not only in an extension of the lifespan, but in arresting processes such as the autoimmune diseases or the various degenerative neuromuscular ones. Then there is the matter of understanding entanglement and its potential, a whole “techno” field that is most likely to develop on the basis of existing achievements. It may fizzle out, yield only highly expensive machinery for “supersecret” communication by governance that has donkeys (us) to provide the finance, or end up with “beam us up, Scotty” since macro entanglement has already been achieved (on a tiny scale and very restricted conditions, but then so were the first computers, that are now handheld cell phones or “Dick Tracy” watches). And as the population increases we shall continue to need more food, even as the temperatures rise, the water supply grows shorter, the weather harsher, and arable land smaller. A new field, or subfield, may develop to grow food not on pastures or in gardens, but in vats. Hydroponics notwithstanding, the knowledge required for large scale production, especially of meat that has neither hoof nor fin, will require knowledge that we do not yet have, and knowledge, its acquisition and an understanding of its application, of knowing the Archimedean lever, is a matter for science before it turns into technology. From the abstract but fundamental to the operational and technical, there is an infinite possibility of new developments, new knowledge, new fields of science and endeavor. But the foremost, the quintessential, is a field that will quantize, or integrate, or enable in any manner at all, the emergence of human unity to the extent that allows humanity’s continued existence, because if we cannot attain sufficient knowledge and understanding to achieve that, then there will be no humans to open any new fields in science, nor in anything else at all.","135,549 followers",Hector Quintanilla,582,1.2K,88.6M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-new-fields-in-science-and-technology-do-you-expect-to-emerge-in-the-next-20-years
4,"Please define what you mean by “technology”. Start with that.If you mean the technical aspects of communications (rather than the sociological stuff that appears so often on Quora), then things like the internet and broad SATCOM coverage, have benefits like the ability to distribute “information” very quickly to a very wide audience.However, “information” can be in the form of erroneous information, lies, and misinterpreted raw data.

For this question, I'm going to assume you're talking about VERY IMPORTANT, DIFFICULT tests. I'll categorize the following items into three categories: cramming three days before, and cramming the night before, and cramming like RIGHT before.Cramming 3 days before:First Day= Scan the material with a highlighter QUICKLY/Watch all the lectures on 1.5x speed.Second and Third Day= Jump into practice tests right away (or redo all of your HW if you don't have them). Eat well and sleep around 6 hours. Don't bother making flashcards or whatever, but take notes on what you've missed and dive into the material again afterwards.Do 30 jumping jacks every two hours to keep your blood flowing. Don't fool around with caffeine, you'll regret it. Put your phone on do-not-disturb.Cramming the night before:Sleep is for the weak. And chuck your phone out the window.But don't kill the phone, you'll need it for last-minute help from your friends. You'll also need it for studying in the bathroom when the coffee hits your system.Just sit down and crash the material. Start off making two cups of coffee. Put 1 of them in the freezer, and sip the other. Don't chug it all in one go though.DO NOT STUDY IN YOUR BEDROOM. You will fall asleep, guaranteed. I don't care how strong you think you are. You'll fail.So sit down at a table and spend, maybe, 1 hour reviewing. If you have practice tests, then dive into them. If you don't, redo ALL of the homework assignments.Around 4–7AM, you're going to feel drowsy. Find that slightly frozen coffee and drink it down.Eat something with this cup. No fruits or vegetables or sweets. Eat protein or healthy grains.An hour or so before the test, focus on rereading the material. Trust me, this will save your ass. You need to re-absorb.If possible, take a really short (5 min) run right before reviewing. If not, don't stress about it, but the run will definitely help.Right before you take the test, you're going to feel really jittery from the coffee and the nerves. DO NOT FRANTICALLY REVIEW 15–20 minutes before the test.This will destroy you… I can't tell you how many times I did this and had a melt down when the test was given to me. Or I saw something wrong while rushing and started getting conflicted.Just sit down and breathe. Concentrate on breathing in and out.Finally, ace your test. Go with your gut answer, don't try to logic it out too much. Just trust me. If you try to argue with yourself, you're going to end up with a trash answer. You've been up all night. Go with your gut.Cramming RIGHT before:This is the most desperate of cases, but it still can be successful.What you CAN do is ask your friends for the answers to the practice test. Then look over how they're solved and write down the hardest things.You can also ask them for the hardest material. Then, rush through it and work down from there.If you can, reread all of the material with a highlighter. Don't write anything down.Don't bother breathing or eating or pooping.On the test, logic EVERYTHING out. I'm assuming you had a decent night of sleep. Just think about what the best answer would be.As you can tell, I am qUItE experienced with cramming for tests. I've been doing it for years, and these methods are what work best for me (A- at the very lowest). Everyone's different, obviously, so you'll have to experiment to find your own method.The best thing would be to just NOT PROCRASTINATE and study well.But good luck with whatever test you have!",90 followers,Amy Lee,640,0,0,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-new-fields-in-science-and-technology-do-you-expect-to-emerge-in-the-next-20-years

Repeatedly think about something and the neurons related to that something will grow dendrites and make associations with other neurons, making it easier for us to remember and recall that something, when needed.  We all know how to learn or memorize by repetition.The second is the more complicated one.  Our brains store information by context and association based on existing mental models (AKA schema).  If we want to learn new information successfully we need to either find an existing mental model that will associate with the new information or we need to build a new mental model in which the new information will fit.The quick learner determines the analogous existing mental model or realizes when they don't have an existing acceptable mental model and they back-off and build a new mental model before trying to absorb the concept that is new.  Building new mental models can be done by outlining or mind-mapping.  Start with the central new concept and branch off to the key features of that concept.  Keep branching off until you reach a point where you have existing knowledge that can connect to the new knowledge.Here is a crude example.
