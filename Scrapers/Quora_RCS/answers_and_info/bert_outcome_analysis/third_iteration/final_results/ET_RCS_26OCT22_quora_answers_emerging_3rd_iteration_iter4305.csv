They did this at no cost to me, and shortly afterwards I switched suppliers to get the best deal on offer at the time. I had been paying a flat rate of around 18p per kWh, but my new deal gives me a daytime rate of 15.25p per kWh and a nighttime rate of 7.73p per kWh.My car has a 100 kWh battery, which is good for about 300 miles of real-world driving (I could do a bit better than that if I drove like a monk but that wouldn’t be any fun). It schedules its own charging so I have it set to only charge from midnight when I am plugged in at home. I have a 30 amp charger on the side of my garage, the purchase and installation of which was almost entirely paid for by a government grant, and this has proved ample for overnight charging.If you do the arithmetic that means I get 300 miles worth of driving for £7.73 (ten dollars US), equivalent to around 2.5p per mile.However, it gets better than that if I go on a long journey because then I get the benefit o...","4,196 followers",Simon Crump,4.2K,2.4K,9.8M,2018,https://www.quora.com/With-all-these-fast-battery-charging-videos-floating-around-and-everyday-news-about-some-new-revolutionary-battery-technology-is-Teslas-Gigafactory-project-a-big-risk
1,"They start to degrade the very first mile you drive. But it's not a problem, because the degradation is very minor.My Model 3 is about 11 months old, and I have driven it almost exactly 11,000 miles. The day I got, it indicated it had 308 miles of range when fully charged.It now has an indicated fully charged range of 301 miles. It will have degraded ~2.5% in the first year.Edit a few days later: I just charged my car to 100% for the first time in many months, that seems to have given the car a chance to balance the cells and perhaps reassess the capacity. In any case, the full charge range isThey start to degrade the very first mile you drive.

I just finished a long drive which is why I did a full charge, and the new range seems to be exactly accurate.So reduce my calculated degradation for the first year to 2% instead of 2 1/2%If the battery degradation is 2%/year in the future, the car will have 260 miles of range at the end of its 10th year, after being driven 120,000 miles.Data from the Tesla Model S, which has been on the market longer, indicates that the battery degradation is greatest in the first year and a lower percentage in subsequent years, so this is probably an overly pessimistic projection.That won’t impair my use of the car if I am still driving it then.",UNKNOWN,John A.

2,"Since jets took to the skies like 6 1/2 decades ago, technology advanced in leaps and bounds, regarding engines, materials, instruments, flight electronics and so on. However the basic shape of the airplane has changed little since the 707s, we’re still flying in giant tubes having wings attached and engines hanging from them. And flights between the same airports take little shorter today with cutting edge 787s and a350s than they did back then.Since jets have replaced propellors, advances that we have seen were evolutionary rather than revolutionary.

3,"I think you will see a long period of incremental improvements aimed primarily at improving cost per seat mile. Supersonic speed could be revived, but it has already failed to gain traction and will always have a negative impact on costs. Similarly the pursuit of great size has been tried and failed!If you can’t, from an economic standpoint, produce successful airliners, what direction, other than economy, can you chase?",38 followers,Scott Rainey,768,2.5K,6.3M,2019,https://www.quora.com/With-all-these-fast-battery-charging-videos-floating-around-and-everyday-news-about-some-new-revolutionary-battery-technology-is-Teslas-Gigafactory-project-a-big-risk
4,"They’re going to look very similar to the ones of today. The shape and design of airliners are dictated by physics, and those rules aren’t going to change.Aerodynamically the current airliner shape is already pretty well optimized. They’re still eking out slight improvements here and there, there’s much all that much left. Engines probably have a higher ceiling for improvements, but their general shape isn’t going to change much. Reducing weight is a fairly big deal right now, which is where the B787 gets a lot of it’s efficiencies from, and why so much of it is built from carbon fiber.You canThey’re going to look very similar to the ones of today.

Customers showed a while ago that price trumps pretty much all other considerations when it comes to air travel.

7,"Yes. Mostly autonomous aircraft will get more popular. Why? Because they can loiter around until the fuel tank is empty without losing concentration. No human error involved. They can hit a (designated) target with precision every time. Again, without any human error.Why won’t autonomous ground vehicles get more popular? Because they need to directly support infantry and other ground units. It’s really hard for a fully or semi-autonomous vehicle to find out the difference between enemy and ally.

8,"Oh, I’ve got one from my time as a young tanker in the early 1980s.See that cool looking searchlight? Turn that on with the cover off on a pitch-black night and you can reach out about 800 to 1000 meters and kill anything you point it at. If you put the cover on and do the same thing, you could use the ‘Infrared’ night sight next to that daylight sight and shoot about 500–600 meters with your weapon systems and unless the enemy had IR sights too, you were virtually invisible.But if they DID have IR sights, all that you did was say SHOOT ME! to everyone looking.Yep night combat in tanks that IOh, I’ve got one from my time as a young tanker in the early 1980s.See that cool looking searchlight?

It was the equivalent of a contest in a darkened basketball court where each team has flashlights and .45cal pistols.Two years later when I was a sergeant, those damned searchlights were dismounted and placed in the motor pool bay, never to be mounted again. After refit our sights were now all Passive sights but the rangefinder was still the same old optical ones that were once the rage on Battleships (not kidding, look up ‘coincidental rangefinders’ if you doubt me).Just one year after that I was a newly commissioned armor officer assigned to a Cavalry Troop and I signed for four M60A3 tanks with a TTS (Tank Thermal Sight) and laser rangefinder and went from comfortably hitting daylight stationary targets at 2000 meters to doing so at 4000–5000 meters night, day, rain, shine or snow, on the move or stationary with the target doing either too.Armor owned the night back then, as the infantry didn’t have any portable thermal sights.",469 followers,Daniel Cohort,11.9K,377,1.2M,1998,https://www.quora.com/What-kind-of-revolutionary-changes-are-expected-in-the-technology-and-design-of-the-future-airliners-Will-they-be-more-cost-effective-faster-and-more-comfortable-than-the-present-airliners

Rather, they are being driven by many technologies. Advances in surface-to-surface missiles, surface-to-air missiles, lasers and various different kinds of radars are threatening to make fighter jets obsolete. For the past 50 years, fighter-bombers have been some of the most powerful and versatile weapons systems on the battlefield. They were largely responsible for the US’s stunning victories in the Gulf War and elsewhere, serving as the backbone of US defense strategy. Nevertheless, a number of technologies are coming online that are spelling the end of the era of fighter dominance.Over the past decade, countries like Russia, China and Iran have fielded a number of precision-guided cruise and ballistic missiles that are specifically designed to take out US and allied fighters at their bases. Fighter jets spend most of their time at fixed, known bases. This makes them easy targets for modern, precision-guided, stand-off munitions.Similarly, Modern air defense systems equipped with high speed surface-to-air missiles are becoming extremely difficult for planes to evade. During earlier conflicts, pilots could outmaneuver or jam enemy air defenses. However, modern air defenses are increasingly difficult to jam, because they can be equipped with frequency hopping radars. Additionally, the performance of missiles has significantly increased over the past couple decades, making it extremely difficult to outrun and outmaneuver modern SAMs.In the coming years, a number of laser technologies will come online that will make it even more difficult for aircraft to stay aloft in contested skies.
