You then copy that information onto another particle somewhere else, presumably after you’ve transported the information through some other means.The basic concept scales without much issue up to the inclusion of an entire human, it’s just that there’s a few tiiiiiny little details that make this difficult at the moment.First off, you’d need to measure each and every single atom in the person’s body… that’s an awful lot of information to store. Far more than we have the capacity to hold at the moment.Second, that whole measuring thing would have to be done quickly… or uhm, yeah, basically you’d be disintegrating the person’s body a little bit at a time. Which probably wouldn’t go over too well with the person being teleported. Nor likely all that well with any of the technicians and such involved unless you make sure the teleportation subject is in a separate room or sedated so they don’t have to listen to the screaming and such.Now, assuming you’ve gotten reaaaaally fast machines which can do all this in fractions of a second and can store it all, then we still have the tiny, tiny issue that we don’t actually really know what consciousness is. It’s difficult to even define, much less to describe it mathematically. We can assume that if we took all of the physical parts of a healthy human body and recreated them identically down to the last atom that, presumably, the consciousness would be in there somewhere intact… but we don’t really know. It might be more complex than just an energy pattern in a physical storage media. But for the sake of argument here, we’ll assume that if you copied the brain, the chemical energy within it and so on, and transported the whole of the human body over, that they wouldn’t arrive braindead.With all this in mind, basically any time you teleported someone, their original body would be destroyed and you’d be building them a new one at the destination.While that sounds preeeeetty unnerving to most people, what with the whole “you will be dead for awhile, but don’t worry, it’s only temporary, honest!” bit and all, it actually would be a bit less so in that each time you used a teleporter, if they stored the information once it was had, they could make a new copy of you at will, basically instant-cloning with memories included. Or maybe that’s more unnerving to you. I dunno, really. Honestly, having a backup you could reload if you died sounds kinda handy to me, as long as someone doesn’t just start printing off extra copies of you behind your back, so to speak.Alternative possibilities may include such things as warping space so that two points converge so you can just walk through something akin to the portals from the game Portal, or the idea of using quantum entanglement to build a copy of someone without destroying their original selves, and then severing the entanglement somehow… though then you’d have two of the person and would have to kill the original. Maybe not so good, after all.Anyway, the first one mentioned is the most likely method by which we would teleport a human and the only one we know for a fact works so far… at least upon things that aren’t alive. We’re still not really sure what would happen to the whole “life” thing through transportation, and our computers aren’t even remotely capable of testing it out even on single-celled organisms for the time being.","63,770 followers",Joshua Engel,614,15.1K,76.7M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Can-teleportation-be-made-possible-in-near-future

3,"Unfortunately, no. Teleportation of anything of mass runs into a little problem calledUncertainty principleIn a nutshell, it says that “the more precisely the position of some particle is determined, the less precisely its momentum can be known, and vice versa.”So we will never be able to accurately track all the particles whizzing around inside of ant solid mass enough in order to tear that mass apart and then put it back together again.If you watch Star Trek enough, you will hear the actors refer from time to time to the Heisenberg Compensaters, which areUnfortunately, no.

HKers prefer credit cards and cash while mainlanders are happy with e-payments like Alipay or WeChat pay. So far, to every person asking me about life in Hong Kong, I keep saying it is extremely far behind on multiple fields including technology, digital and innovation.The examples are all over here. So yeah, if you were to compare China to other developing countries, it definitely is way ahead of them technologically.However, the problem about China is not whether China’s technology is advanced or not, but even though China is now churning out a lot of patents,Second, China is a huge territory, many areas of China are still in poverty and they need time to change. Despite having the world's second-largest economy and third-largest military, China is still not classified as a developed country. The biggest reason: Its per capita GDP remains below any accepted minimum threshold for developed-country status. China’s GDP per capita is around $9,000 (Moreover, as the population ages, environmental constraints bite, the economy is arguably more state-dominated, and returns on investment fall, growth — already far below rates achieved before 2008 — might fall to levels little, if any, higher than in the high-income countries. Convergence would then stall. A debt crisis might make such a slowdown more abrupt.That could mean more room for catch-up growth, but to get there China will have to avoid the middle income trap that keeps many emerging economies stuck below a GDP per capita of around $15,000. To date, no large economy has made the transition without liberalizing.America would remain the epicenter of innovation in the world over the next ten years.However, I'd say, the implication behind developed being that there is no more growth to go. In addition, while other countries are laying out the welcome mat to outside talent and capital and receiving government support of important sectors such as artificial intelligence and abundance of venture cash, the Trump administration’s posturing on immigration and other matters (like cutting back on science funding and more) are deterring foreign talent and money from coming to US shores. In the digital economy, you hire where the talent is. When you restrict immigration, the jobs still get created, just somewhere else. And later down the road, when those individuals create the next Google, it won’t be here. All that probably could make America less competitive and slow down the country. Americans overlook the benefit of their country’s reputation as a magnet for talents and researchers. In addition to their learning something from the U.S, the U.S. learn something from them.US Senator Elizabeth Warren proposed breaking up big tech companies like Amazon, Google and Facebook to allow for more competition. Then Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes wrote an opinion piece in May that also called for breaking up Facebook. Well, speaking of the idea of breaking up the tech companies, you could break them up, but you actually don’t address the underlying issue people are concerned about. While people are concerned with the size and power of tech companies, there’s also a concern in the United States with the size and power of Chinese companies, and the realization that those companies are not going to be broken up. As a tangent, I’ve found it curious that Congress has become so keen to publicly beat up on Facebook and Google while the US considers itself in technological competition with China.China is still much poorer over all than the United States in terms of quality of life or GDP per capita. But the Chinese have taken a commanding lead in that most intangible but valuable of economic indicators:America needs to “get [its] act together as a country” to develop a strategy that involves both government and private industry.

In that time China's potential to leapfrog the U.S. has gone from talk to substantive examples of leadership. Even so, I've been surprised by the increasing frequency with which China is pushing ahead in new fronts of cleantech development.Earlier this week, the latest surprise came from energy secretary Steven Chu, who's been talking up China's green progress in an effort to boost Washington's resolve on clean tech policy.In a talk at the National Press Club, with characteristic forceful clarity (PDF of slides), Chu illuminated the growing list of sectors where China's emerging leadership threatens U.S. players, and added leadership in supercomputing as the most recent Sino-superlative. China's success in these technologies represents a ""Sputnik Moment"" for the United States, Chu said.""When it comes to innovation, Americans don't take a back seat to anyone -- and we certainly won't start now,"" said Secretary Chu at the event. ""From wind power to nuclear reactors to high-speed rail, China and other countries are moving aggressively to capture the lead. Given that challenge, and given the enormous economic opportunities in clean energy, it's time for America to do what we do best: innovate.""China's ascent to the top of the list for supercomputing speed reveals a new front in this race. Last month China's Tianhe-1A, developed by Chinese defense researchers, became the world's fastest supercomputer, with a performance level of 2.57 petaflop/s (quadrillions of calculations per second, for all the geeks in our audience, based on a standard test), substantially eclipsing the U.S. DOE's Cray XT5 ""Jaguar"" system at Oak Ridge national labs in Tennessee, which runs at 1.75 petaflop/s. Third place is also held by a Chinese computer.Supercomputers may seem long way from grid-competitive solar panels, long-range electric car batteries, or other cleantech gizmos, but advanced computational simulation is the keystone of most leading-edge scientific research, including nuclear energy, nanotech and materials science, proteomics and other advanced biotech applications. Basically, any very advanced science these days needs big computing horsepower. Leadership on the fastest-computer league tables has been traded off many times, between U.S., Japanese and European computing centers. China is a relative newcomer to the race, but is clearly the new elite.Chu highlighted several crucial technologies -- mostly in the areas of power generation and transportation -- where China is already outpacing U.S. efforts, adding the U.S. must innovate or risk falling far behind. The following is from the DOE:• High Voltage Transmission. China has deployed the world's first Ultra High Voltage AC and DC lines -- including one capable of delivering 6.4 gigawatts to Shanghai from a hydroelectric plant nearly 1300 miles away in southwestern China. These lines are more efficient and carry much more power over longer distances than those in the United States.• High-Speed Rail. In the span of six years, China has gone from importing this technology to exporting it, with the world's fastest train and the world's largest high-speed rail network, which will become larger than the rest of the world combined by the end of the decade. Some short distance plane routes have already been cancelled, and train travel from Beijing to Shanghai (roughly equivalent to New York to Chicago) has been cut from 11 hours to 4 hours.• Advanced Coal Technologies. China is rapidly deploying supercritical and ultra-supercritical coal combustion plants, which have fewer emissions and are more efficient than conventional coal plants because they burn coal at much higher temperatures and pressures. Last month, Secretary Chu toured an ultra-supercritical plant in Shanghai which claims to be 45 to 48 percent efficient. The most efficient U.S. plants are about 40 percent efficient. China is also moving quickly to design and deploy technologies for Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) plants as well as Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS).• Nuclear Power. China has more than 30 nuclear power plants under construction, more than any other country in the world, and is actively researching fourth generation nuclear power technologies.• Alternative Energy Vehicles. China has developed a draft plan to invest $17 billion in central government funds in fuel economy, hybrids, plug-in hybrids, electric and fuel cell vehicles, with the goal of producing 5 million new energy vehicles and 15 million fuel-efficient conventional vehicles by 2020.• Renewable Energy. China is installing wind power at a faster rate than any nation in the world, and manufactures 40 percent of the world's solar photovoltaic (PV) systems. It is home to three of the world's top ten wind turbine manufacturers and five of the top ten silicon-based PV manufacturers in the world.","68,804 followers",Kanthaswamy Balasubramaniam,898,17.3K,413.8M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-features-do-you-expect-in-mobile-phones-10-years-from-now

It is more like a developed country that has a twin brother that is still in development.And if you take a look at the PISA findings of 2013 comparing the math scores of pupils from all the OECD countries Shanghai-China pupil scored best while Swiss and Germany are above average and US is below average. As far as I understand there are no data for China as a whole so its biased but if you take a look at these numbers, Chinese people within a decade are likely to be one of the most mathematical sound work force of the planet.So to state my opinion in a single sentence: “China is not a developing country anymore and it does very well in educational sector when it comes to its most developed areas which are as big as Germany as a whole so the intellectual output of China sooner or later will bypass the output of Germany and sooner or later that of US, so your question is not valid any more and needs to be rephrased.”",1 follower,Dawei Chen,712,141,2.8M,2016,https://www.quora.com/What-features-do-you-expect-in-mobile-phones-10-years-from-now

The speed of light (There is no reason within known physics to expect that we will ever exceed the speed of light. The speed of light (Some theoretical methods have been proposed for FTL travel that cleverly avoid actually violating the speed of light. An Alcubierre drive would warp space in front of and behind the spaceship so that the ship can travel at sub-light speeds inside a bubble of local space-time that itself is moving, thereby traveling faster than light. This requires shrinking space-time in front of the ship and expanding it behind. We can expand space-time with large amounts of mass or energy, but shrinking space-time requires negative energy, which doesn't exist at the large levels required to make the drive work (as far as we know).http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcubierre_driveMaking space-time warp to ""cheat"" the equations of Relativity would be incredibly difficult or impossible in reality. The existence of theoretical ways to get around the speed of light under General Relativity at all is believed by some to represent a flaw in the theory that we will overcome someday. Even if the theory is right, the calculated energy requirements are unfathomably large and are far beyond what a spaceship could ever carry by any means known or imagined. Other proposals, such as wormholes, also require some sort of exotic negative-energy source that isn't believed to actually exist.

Remarkably, relativity does not prohibit particles from traveling that fast.

There is no limit: you can get some place in an arbitrarily small amount of time if you build a big enough rocket engine.But you still can't go faster than light.But isn't the speed of light a fixed value? Yes. And that's the problem. Everybody measures the speed of light, relative to them self, as c. The person who stayed on earth measures the speed of a light beam moving at c. But so do you, even after your rocketship propels you off at some fantastic velocity. So no matter how fast you reckon you are going, to you, a light beam is always going faster, by the amount c. You can go as fast as you like, but a light beam will always beat you in a race. So you can get somewhere in as little time as you like, but you can never go faster than light.Part of the confusion is that in our commonplace world, we sometimes use the words 'faster' and 'sooner' interchangeably. Part of Einstein's insight was to recognize these two things were very different. You can always get some place sooner, but you still can't go faster than light.So let's say you try and race a light beam. To you, light always goes faster, so it will always reach the finish line first. Your personal best is never good enough, light will always beat you to the finish line.But what about someone watching the race from earth? Naturally, they will always see the light beam finish first too. So let's say the race track is in the Earth's frame, and a measuring tape in that frame shows the race track is 10 light minutes long. That means to the earth observer, the race will always take exactly 10 minutes: the time it takes for the light beam to go from start to finish. But the light beam always wins, so it must take you at least a little more than 10 minutes. No matter how big a rocketship engine you build.You can make the race in as little time as you like. Let's say your rocket engine is so big you reduce your travel time to 1 minute. Now everybody can see your clock, and everyone will agree your clock only ticks off one minute. The earth observer will always see that it took you more than 10 minutes, so by his reckoning, your clock must be slow.Now every time you build a bigger engine and get to the end point in less time, since light always beats you, that means it takes the light  beam a little less time as well. If you reckon light always travels at the fixed value of c, and if you use the light beam as a measuring stick, every time you make it to the finish line sooner, the distance between the start and finish lines must be getting smaller, so that the light beam, at its fixed speed, can get there sooner too. So this is how you can make at '10 light minute' racetrack in only a minute without going faster than light: as far as you are concerned, the race track can't be much longer than 1 light minute.Now consider the famous 'twin paradox': turn our drag race to a relay race. At the finish line there is a mirror, and so when the light beam gets there it bounces back toward the starting line. You have an identical rocketship going in the other direction, timed perfectly so that it crosses the finish line exactly when you do, and you leap to the other rocketship as they pass each other. Of course the light beam doubles its lead by the time it arrives at the finish line. To the earth observer, 20 minutes have elapsed during the race. But to you the trip is a little over two minutes, so the earth observer is actually older than you when you get back.So there you have it: clocks run slower, lengths contract, nobody goes faster than light, and there is no magic barrier that makes bigger and bigger rocket engines useless.",2 followers,Richard Muller,4.2K,2.3K,202.4M,2015,https://www.quora.com/Can-teleportation-be-made-possible-in-near-future

Suppose you're on a very fast train that's going at 99% of the speed of light. If a child within the train starts running fast enough a person standing outside would observe the child to be moving faster than light. The laws of special relativity account for this by slowing down time for the child just enough, so that an observer outside the train would never see the child moving faster than light. This has been experimentally verified by looking at muons (The amount of energy needed to accelerate a person to such speeds would be very large, assuming it were practically possible. If you had the entire world's supply of energy for one year, and assuming perfect efficiency which is often very far off, you could accelerate a person fast enough to produce a time dilation of 1 + E_world / (m_person * c^2) = 70.

In your space ship, your eyes still see visible light, but for you, that’s microwave and infrared emissions as you approach and X-rays as you pass by. So brown dwarf stars will be reasonably bright as you come up to them, then disappear as you pass.Edit 1: Just to add some numbers: at .999c, the Lorentz factor is ~22.4. So, your trip past Sol to Proxima Centauri, 4.22ly distant, takes 4.2242 years as measured on Earth, but only 0.18797 or about 69 days on the ship. As you pass supposedly “spherical” bodies, you measure them to be 22.4 times as wide as they are thick: or only 4.4% as thick as the apparent diameter facing you. When you approach a star or planet, it looks like this:But as you pass it and look out the side:Edit 2: Looks like this is homing in on 200 upvotes, so in honour of that, I’ll add some more numbers.

Observing from Earth, you’ll get to Proxima Centauri in just 22 minutes longer than the 4.22 years it would take light to get there. But on board the ship, the whole trip past Sol to Proxima Centauri only takes a little less than a week.At six nines, the factor is 707. Earth sees your ship arrive 133 seconds after the light pulse, and on board the ship it takes a bit more than 52 hours.At seven nines, the factor is 2236. From Earth, only 2.2 minutes separate the laser announcing the ship is heading that way and the ship arriving, but on board the ship, the trip takes 16.5 hours.At 8, the factor is 7071 and the ship’s experience of the trip takes a mere 5 hours.At 10, the factor is 70,710 and the trip takes 31 minutes on the ship.At 12, the factor is 707,115 (I suspect the calculator has some rounding error: I’m usingTo get it down to about 18 seconds, we probably have to go to 14 nines.
