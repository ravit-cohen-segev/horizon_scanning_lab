In 2020, factories will be more efficient than ever before and human employees will gradually lessen. In fact, the entire manufacturing industry is at risk of disappearing due to the rise of the 3D printers.They’ll be printing more and more products at increasingly cheaper prices. We’ll see revolutionary developments in healthcare as well. A plethora of new medical devices and wearables will be introduced to help us monitor our health.Examples are the FitBit health tracker and the intelligent pill. Connected to your smart mirror, these wearables and ingestibles will tell you exactly how you’re doing.1. Although robots now have a low IQ, in 2020 they’ll be fetching kids from the schoolsThe emergence of robotics has started a new scientific era with endless possibilities. We’ll be seeing robots everywhere: on land, in the oceans and in the skies. They will work in our factories, assist us in the army and provide care in hospitals and nursing homes. Robots are becoming smarter and will soon be able to solve complex problems. This is possible because they are in contact with an endless number of sources.Many repetitive tasks are already being done by robots. The smart industrial robot Baxter is a familiar sight in factories around the world. He does product inspection, welds, paints and performs pick and place tasks as well as transport work. Baxter robots are cheaper, more accurate, faster and more durable than their human counterparts.We’ll also start seeing robots in our homes. Think robot vacuum cleaners and robot maids. In 2025, robots will cook for us and fetch our children from school. Some restaurants have already replaced traditional waitresses with iPads – which in time will make way for helpful robots.Experiments with robots regularly take place in stores where they support the existing employees. Care robots such as Nexi and Zora are already being used in hospitals and nursing homes. They hand out medication, assist where required and provide social interaction.The 90-centimeter tall robot ASIMO (Advanced Step in Innovative Mobility) was the first humanoid robot introduced to the public. He looks like a cross between an iPod and a spacesuit and with one single charge, ASIMO works for several hours. He has cameras in his head and with the sensors in the lower parts, he scans the ground surface. ASIMO can pick up objects, climb stairs and even ‘run’– at a moderate pace of six kilometres per hour.In the years ahead, we’ll see a continuation in the development of artificial intelligence; kick starting major breakthroughs and bringing extreme change to our societies and economies. In ten years, we will no longer be able to tell the difference between certain types of robots and humans. Robots do however still lack certain key elements, preventing full relationships with humans.The biggest challenges are human emotions and even though artificial intelligence will help us improve these skills in robots; until then we’ll have to work with our friendly Nexi and other social robots. In 2020, the developments in artificial intelligence are expected to be so advanced that robots will be able to make independent decisions, aided by data, algorithms and sensors. By that time, they’ll be able to feel, taste and smell. Presently, however, robots still have the IQ of a dog.One thing is certain: because robots are many times more efficient and much cheaper, their deployment will result in many job losses. We’ll work less and slowly but surely move towards unconditional basic incomes, resulting in a better quality of life and more room for creativity and innovation.2. Autonomous drones to assist humans in security and delivery servicesDrones are everywhere. They offer solutions to many challenges. These ingenious pieces of technology are equipped with sensors and cameras and are connected to other systems.They can assist the police force and deliver parcels. We find them in the construction industry, the military, agriculture, journalism and the film industry. The uses for drone technology are endless.A great example is the rope bridge which was made by a group of drones without any human assistance; an experiment by researchers from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology. Business owners deploying drone technology can look forward to significant time and resource savings.3. Gadgets to monitor and record health dataWearable technology has undergone exponential developments in the past few years. We’re talking about smart watches, fitness and health trackers and any other connected devices imaginable. Wearables are the biggest innovation since the smartphone and the possibilities are literally endless.Wearables belong to a new wave of development in which everyone and everything is linked. An example of wearable tech is the FitBit, a fitness tracker that monitors your physical activity. It helps you eat better, exercise more and it measures the quality of your sleep.The FitBit knows how often you wake up and how long it takes before you fall asleep. Is that strong espresso you had at 5pm still keeping you awake? Even that doesn’t go unnoticed. In the years ahead, we’ll be seeing a lot more FitBit-like technology which will very quickly be replaced by smart wearables such as band-aid type patches, implants and ingestibles. Imagine what it could mean for our health if we are able to monitor and analyse our bodies?4. Virtual reality to become common technology for information and entertainment2016 was the year when we saw many more virtual and augmented reality applications, besides those in computer gaming. This technology will also enable us to help emergency services train and prepare their personnel for disaster scenarios.There are many possible applications in the social field and in education. Virtual reality enables children to learn and experience all kinds of things in ‘multi-sensory’ environments. From a purely social perspective, virtual reality will allow us to share many interesting experiences with others and the obstacle of physical distance or physical impairments will, in a way, be overcome.One of the most innovative gadgets developed in recent years is Google Glasses. This wearable looks akin to a pair of futuristic spectacles. You can control it with your voice and it actually works as a kind of extension of your smartphone. It plays your favourite music, accesses the Internet and takes photos and videos. It detects objects and enhances them with additional information.The Sacramento Kings used Glass to give their basketball fans a ‘first person’ experience by showing them the match through Slamson’s eyes. Research is being conducted into applications for the public transport sector – think augmented reality for the visually and hearing impaired and for people with other disabilities.The Microsoft virtual reality HoLoLens looks a little like ski goggles; it’s like putting an untethered pc on your face which enables you to see high definition holograms inserted into your physical world. The VR wearable already has a number of test applications in Skype and in games such as Minecraft. The prototype works fast, provides good image quality and is controlled with hand gestures, head movements and speech.The device has huge application potential for businesses as well as consumers. Although there are no ‘official’ applications yet, as a developer you can build all sorts of interesting functionality for it. It is certainly interesting to keep an eye on the future developments of these and other virtual reality headsets. The only limit is our imagination!5. The Internet of Things to help manage daily activitiesWith the explosion of the Internet of Things, the number of devices connected to the Internet will increase from around 13 billion today to 50 billion in 2020. The IoT is a rapidly evolving wave of technology. More and more technologies are integrated with it and it’s fast developing into a network where absolutely everything is connected; from wind turbines to home appliances and factory machinery to entire urban energy networks.The smart factory is a good example. Machines know when other machines need to be serviced, and maintenance is carried out by robots. Maintenance data is then analysed by smart control systems which predict future service focus areas. The only thing human technicians still need to check is whether the maintenance is carried out correctly and safely. Smart factories are completely vertically integrated; data is measured at machine level and sent to the cloud where it is integrated with the service processes in backend systems.Another interesting example is the smart fridge that keeps track of what you buy and eat, when you buy and eat it and when it’s time to order new groceries. As soon as you run out of food, it will order a fresh supply from the supermarket – after having checked with your electronic pill of course, so that the fridge knows which products promote optimal health. Your self-driving car will then collect your groceries from the nearest pickup point – with automated payments running in the background.Soon, every single thing will have a digital layer that enables it to communicate with the cloud. Things will no longer be able to function independently. This means that they will be useless unless connected to each other and to the IoT. The abovementioned smart refrigerator will verify the expiration dates on your food products but it does need to be connected to the products, the supermarket and to you – because he’ll need your permission first. Or will we eventually skip that step too?",4 followers,Leon Brennan,24.9K,693,21.5M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-technology-will-be-popular-in-the-future-and-why

When I heard the doctor tell her “six months”, it felt likeI met my wife, Jess, twenty-one years ago when she was nineteen.Our parents owned side-by-side cabins in the northern part of New York and we both happened to be along for the week-long hunting trip our fathers planned that year.Jess' father was a skilled hunter and could hit a headshot from a mile away — same as my dad.Jess and I didn't hunt with them — we hung out by the lake.The moment I saw Jess I fell in lThis February my wife was diagnosed and given six months to live. When I heard the doctor tell her “six months”, it felt likeI met my wife, Jess, twenty-one years ago when she was nineteen.Our parents owned side-by-side cabins in the northern part of New York and we both happened to be along for the week-long hunting trip our fathers planned that year.Jess' father was a skilled hunter and could hit a headshot from a mile away — same as my dad.Jess and I didn't hunt with them — we hung out by the lake.The moment I saw Jess I fell in love. We've been together ever since.But now, now that she has an expiration date, I just don't know what to do — I'm scared and lost.Monday morning at work I was telling my best friend and supervisor, Timmy, about my wife's condition. Timmy told me that I.T. or Intelligent Terrestrial just came out with their latest models.These models are different than those of yesteryear because they are 52% mechanical and 48% biological.Timmy said all you have to do is mail a sample of DNA to I.T. and upload a digital copy of your consciousness through an app. You can then purchase a custom made clone at an age of your choice. When the clone arrives it will turn on, study it's surroundings and await a consciousness download.“Oh my God Timmy, what's the catch?”“The price, Leon.”When I got home from work, Jess and I plugged in and uploaded a digital copy of our entire conscious catalog to I.T. and then mailed off DNA samples.Jess asked me what age I wanted her to be. It felt awkward to say “twenty”, but I did it — I was honest. I miss her smooth, youthful skin and I want her to be young and healthy — especially if I have to cash my entire 401K in to afford it.We told her parents that we were going to basically bring her back from the dead and her father threatened to shoot any abomination that we brought into this world.One month later, on a day that Jess was particularly ill, the doorbell rang.Jess and I dragged the box through the door and laid it on the living room floor. I gently cut along the lines and when I opened the flaps, there,she,was.The last time my heart fluttered like this was the day I met her.Jess helped me lift I.T. out of the box and sit I.T. up.I.T. was warm and soft. I.T. was mine. I paid for I.T. I own I.T.Machines like this don't have rights — even though they are part biological, the governments recognize them in the same way they would a lawnmower — so, as I said, I.T. is my possession.The science behind uploading a digital consciousness is so cutting edge, that the laws just haven't caught up yet.Jess turned I.T. on and I.T. looked right into my eyes. I was in love — with two women, but, it was the same woman. We hadn't uploaded Jess' consciousness yet, so, I.T. was running on basic programming, but I.T. was gorgeous.Jess asked me what I wanted to do, and for the first time in a very long time — I lied to her.I told her we should go shopping and buy I.T. some clothes.I.T. doesn't seem to have a personality yet.“Hello…. Smile…”Jess picked outfits for both of them and we went for a walk through the park together. It was amazing — I was so happy.We walked down a cozy little trail and found a tuck away to sit and talk.I.T. watched and studied every move Jess and I made. I.T. was learning and adapting.I.T. was becoming aware.At one point Jess and I got distracted and I.T. wandered off. When we found I.T., I.T. was gazing at the sky.I asked I.T. what it was doing. I.T. said, “Where do I come from?”“You come from Heaven. You are my angel.”That answer seemed to work for I.T. We all walked back to the car and headed home.When we got home, Jess immediately started coughing. She fell to the ground and I tried to help her, but I didn't know what to do.Jess passed away right then. It was finally over.I called her family and the police. It took an hour for them to remove the body. I had Jess 2.0 sitting in my back room waiting for them to leave.After the police left, I plugged I.T. into my laptop and downloaded Jess' consciousness.After the download was complete, we walked outside and I looked into her gigantic brown eyes. I asked her, “Is it you, Jess?”She smiled and said, “It is, silly — now kiss me.”Her head slammed back. I didn't know if she was glitching or what and then I heard a bang and saw a hole above her left eye.My beautiful Jessica died twice today. I was crushed.Over the next two decades, I fell into a deep, dark, alcohol-fueled depression. Although I had developed a serious alcohol problem, I was able to work and save every single penny I earned.After twenty years of saving, I decided I wanted both of them back — the twenty-year-old Jess and the forty-year-old Jess.I sent my entire life savings off to I.T. and in one month, my doorbell rang.I cut the box open and wept when I saw my angel(s).I turned them on.I also clothed them. The younger version of me may have left them in the nude, but at this age, I just want my companion(s) back.The ladies helped me back to my room to lay down. I was so tired from all the excitement.I've waited and worked an entire lifetime to be with the woman I love. And now, at long last — she is beside me.I died, on that very night as a happy man.One day later, the doorbell rang. It seems my beautiful Jessicas used my direct deposit life insurance benefit to make a purchase.They gently cut the box open.And turned me on.You ask where technology will be in 2050?We will be everywhere.LeonSpecial thanks:Cameron — Dear friend.

Subcontinent does not have issue with English and that is the biggest plus in this regard, I think.Absence of meritocracy has robbed people of firm foothold locally, particularly in my country. That is why good brains are moving out. I have good reason to believe that the ratio will continue to rise as long as merit is honored in the West. What I fear is the shrinkage of opportunity-base.

7,"Broadly speaking, I think that there are a few key factors which enable Indians to occupy top positions in companies and in academia all over the world, such as fluency in English, size of the population, and the toughness born out of growing up in a highly competitive environment.Many Indians, particularly in the big cities, are educated in English right from the lowest grade level to the highest. Most big companies only work in English, so Indians tend to find it easy to fit into the corporate environment.

Most big companies only work in English, so Indians tend to find it easy to fit into the corporate environment. This is a challenge for the Chinese, because they are less fluent in English.India has a huge population, so it is also going to have a lot of really smart people. This is an argument based on simple proportions and is fairly self-evident. Conversely, tiny countries have fewer smart people. China is similar to India in this regard at the present moment, but China’s population is aging at a higher rate due to the one-child policy.When you grow up in an extremely competitive environment (few resources among a lot of people) and succeed, it builds a certain kind of resilience, grit, and toughness, along with a scrappy attitude, which may be relatively less in people born in more developed countries. Maybe this somewhat explains why Americans were a minority in the STEM PhD program and area that I was involved with. Top graduate STEM programs in the US have a vast majority of Indian and Chinese students, which is why Indians and Chinese people also occupy the top positions in corporate R&D labs.",18 followers,Asim Qureshi,14.4K,996,155.9M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-technology-will-be-popular-in-the-future-and-why

Beheruz Sethna's chapter on Indian students probes more deeply into Indian culture, where hard work is prioritized over a sense of innate giftedness, and the stereotype of ""pushy parents,"" ...You will note that even the reviewer picked up on my theme of “pushy parents.” Below, I share with you the first few paragraphs of my chapter, giving acknowledgement to Boothe and Stanley’s book, which was referenced above.Many years ago, in a small town in upstate New York, Mr. Rick Meyer, a second grade teacher, issued a challenge to his students: he would have optional assignments and award points for doing well in each optional classroom and homework activity. All those students who accumulated 100 points at the end of the year would be invited, along with their parents, to his home for a cookout. At the end of the year, he was true to his word, and invited the students who had scored at least 100 points and their parents to his home. As this celebration of student accomplishment was winding down, he remarked to the parents that, as he was sending out the invitations, he had noted that the vast majority of invited students from that town lived on the same street. “It must be something in the water,” he joked.At that, one of the mothers present – she was an American, not of Indian origin – shook her head in disagreement.“Pushy parents,” she said laconically.That two-word explanation was accepted as being sufficient explanation by all the adults. The students, fortunately, were off having fun at more enjoyable activities at the time the remark was made.While the preceding vignette was not about Indian children or Indian parents (in fact, only one of the students present was of Indian origin {Edit: my son}), this wisdom imparted by the mother of one of the students, in two words, is an important reason behind the stereotype of giftedness of children of Indian origin.The main reason is, of course, the talents and hard work of the students themselves. Nothing in this chapter should be interpreted as taking away from the accomplishments of the students.However, the essence of the belief systems of the parents of Indian origin is that their children can and will succeed, and that no sacrifice on the part of the parents or the children is too great. These parents impart to their children a culture of hard work, clear focus, building strong credentials, and a single-minded pursuit of careers that lead to prestige and material rewards and recognition.Box insert:When I was in California recently, one of the teachers asked me why students from India are so smart. My husband’s son is a dentist, and several of their neighbors are affluent physicians from India. The consensus seems to be that the Indian / Indian American children study all of the time, are afraid of disappointing their parents and earning a grade that is less than perfect or an A, and see monetary links to good grades at an early age. … Boothe, D.

Other rankings from other journals and newspapers for bachelors and graduate courses suggest that RIT is amongst one of the best in the nation and top 10 in the north eastern region, competing with univ like MIT, Stanford and alike. I have heard some comparisons between Ivy league univ and RIT. I don't want to endorse those rumors as i cannot back it up with facts. But I wouldn't be surprised if we are not really far off from them. Recently US news came up with a report that said RIT is one of the most innovative schools in US.RIT ranked among ‘Most Innovative Schools’ by ‘U.S. News & World Report’Rochester Institute of TechnologyNow coming to the point on why Indians prefer RIT over other universities. Most of the Indians ,like me, who come to RIT are mostly admitted to the Computer Science department. I can say with utmost confidence that top companies like Apple, Google, Amazon, Intuit want students from this universities to come and work for them. Due to the nature of the visa provided for entering US it will only makes sense for an Indian to get into a university that has better job prospects. Simple reason for that would be to pay back the money put into their education. There is no way an Indian could pay even the less expensive universities tuition fees with the salary they make in India. Only option is to earn in DOLLARS and pay back. It will take me 6 more months to pay the tuition fees of RIT as compared to other universities but i am assured a job at RIT in comparison to other universities which helps me stay in U.S. and make that payment.RIT also has a very flexible co-op and internship programs which helps us a lot to make financial provisions by working and also finding job.

This experience pays off later while searching for full time jobs.Indian students, in general, take loan to pay the tuition fees, and they prefer to fund their study while they are studying. On-campus jobs are easy to find, which almost covers the monthly living expenses.Also, this university has good reputation amongst the counselors in India and they often recommend RIT for CS. This makes an impact on student's decision when they get multiple admits.To sum up, Good reach with Indian counselors, Industry oriented course structure, better faculty and ample Intern/Co-op and job opportunities subsides the tuition fees factor.Adding Tution fees and on-campus job info.For Tutions and other total check your course credits * updated tution fee per credit. For example MS in CS with 3 bridge course = 39 credits. Fee = 39*1700 (assume per credit fee).Plus monthly $500 for expenses is enough if staying off campus.Subtract any scholarship from total.On-campus dining jobs are easy to get almost every student if apply, get a job. Minus is you need to focus on study not jobs here. If you score well, your scholarship increment will be more that what on-campus job will pay. Still on-campus job is enough to cover living expenses here, in case parent can not afford $350–500 per month.",331 followers,Brad Glenn,2.5K,0,0,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-technology-will-be-popular-in-the-future-and-why

17,"There are so many ways different people define how to advance a city. Many people would say getting away from the glass box skyscraper of today & designing with an earlier eye to architecture would be advancing the city scape. But that is just the buildings. Perhaps you are asking about infrastructure. The US as a whole needs to upgrade that to be sure. Or maybe you are asking about advancing a city with social reforms. You see where the problem comes in with the question you ask?? Just considering the city scape, many people would see lot of new, gleaming, structures as a big step forward.

One of the newest cities (and assuming that is most advanced) is Phoenix Arizona.

18,"Please define ‘advanced’. Every American city without exception offers public school education, sanitation services, an infrastructure to supply every household and business with water, electric power, sewage, law enforcement, courts, free elections, some form of public transportation, shopping facilities and entertainment facilities. Most of the public services are paid for through taxation. So I would say that although the quality of life in American cities may vary a little bit, overall all American cities are advanced and very much the same.",UNKNOWN,Bill Yu Liao (廖彧),650,138,1.9M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-technology-will-be-popular-in-the-future-and-why

Most of the time it’s C or C++, with all sorts of interesting custom libraries to help manage power costs, computing cycles and all sorts of madness. If you’re coding for say a laptop on ISS this is less true, but generally expect to be close to the hardware, or doing some kind of data analysis on weird raw data.Last, expect to spend at least four times as long documenting and characterizing your code as you do writing it.All this being said, it’s incredibly cool when something you helped write runs on another planet or in space for the first time, and it works just like it should.",928 followers,Clayton Badeaux,1.8K,1.1K,2.2M,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-technology-will-be-popular-in-the-future-and-why

Typical fresh CS grads with a focus in areas companies care about most (software engineering), can expect $85,000–105,000 (higher than that even, if you get into a really good company).
