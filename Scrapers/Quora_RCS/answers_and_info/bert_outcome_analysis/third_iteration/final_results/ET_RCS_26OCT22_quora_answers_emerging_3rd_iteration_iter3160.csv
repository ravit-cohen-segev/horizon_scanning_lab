1,"All Fantastic Four movies have scored low on Rotten Tomatoes. For some reason, it’s just hard to make a good Fantastic Four film. Everything has been tried but nothing works. Someone even had the nutty idea to cast a popular African-American actor to play Johnny Storm. That gimmick didn’t work either. But here’s an interesting irony. There is a parody of the Fantastic Four which is a critically acclaimed box office success and audiences love it. It is called The Incredibles. The incredibles is obviously the Fantastic Four but done in such a way that Pixar Animation Studios can’t get sued. ButAll Fantastic Four movies have scored low on Rotten Tomatoes.

But any moron knows the Incredibles is really the Fantastic Four.What Marvel Studios should do is analyze and consider what it is that Pixar got right and what it is that previous Fantastic Four movie makers got wrong. What might solve the problem is to make a Fantastic Four script that is very *character* driven instead of action driven or special effects driven. Just screen-write a sensitive story and show all the special effects action at the end of the movie. The strategy was successfully done before with the 2014 film Birdman which went on to win an Oscar for best movie.",UNKNOWN,Dallas,572,5.7K,68.2M,2022,https://www.quora.com/How-did-the-Mole-Man-get-advanced-technology-resembling-a-holodeck-back-in-Fantastic-Four-296

(Might be wrong and I can’t be bothered to check).Obviously, in light of the past, German military spending has been tilted towards defence. No doubt, if Germany were to do more when it comes to NATO involvement outside of Europe, there would be comments about “The Condor legion “ on the rise again. (I sometimes get the feeling that Germany cannot win).When it comes to the present German government spending I understand that the German military is way down on the list behind social and green matters.However this is currently at 1.36% of GDP which doesn’t mark it out so differently from many in Europe and actually puts it ahead of Spain by quite a distance. France spends 1.78% and Britain 2% the USA spends approximately 3.2%.","1,708 followers",Niklas Kager Kofler,688,305,8.3M,2020,https://www.quora.com/How-did-the-Mole-Man-get-advanced-technology-resembling-a-holodeck-back-in-Fantastic-Four-296

One time we weIn 2003 I was working for Cisco Systems and at the time we learned that the US Department of Defense had worked with Intel and other chip manufacturers to install in their hardware the ability to remotely disable any device using their technology with a certain radio frequency. Supposedly, this technology was used to help cripple the Iraqi air defense system when the US invaded.This was important to Cisco because we were working in security and cryptography and the NSA was forever trying to get us to corrupt our products so they could un-encrypt foreign transmissions on the fly. One time we were required to corrupt product that had been shipped to China and it started a major debate about our fiduciary responsibility to the country or to the customer. The issue was that if you sell a security product that you know is corrupted, you are knowingly committing fraud and are liable. As the Product Manager at the time I asked the NSA if they would stand behind us (and me as I might be personally liable) in court if we were discovered. Of course the answer from the NSA was “Hell no.”We were on our own. We then entered into a long debate about how to detect Easter eggs and other corruption introduced into security products unknowingly through another vendor’s corrupted hardware. The issue was never resolved but it should be known that our security source code HAD to be provided to the NSA in order to get FIPS certification and they made certain changes to it.So to answer your question, USA military technology is advanced far beyond anyone’s knowledge to describe the extent.On the other hand, the Chinese probably know more about our technology than we do since they perpetrated the greatest security breach in history by compromising the RSA key technology used by almost everyone in the world. We only learned of it through the vigilance of Lockheed-Martin who discovered the breach accidentally. But for months the Chinese had the key to almost every computer in the world.","5,990 followers",Jens Böttiger,566,2.6K,17.6M,2017,https://www.quora.com/How-did-the-Mole-Man-get-advanced-technology-resembling-a-holodeck-back-in-Fantastic-Four-296

The next morning he wakes up, wades out with the others, and within a few short minutes begins to spear several fish. He notices he has more than he can eat that day, so he eats his fill and shares with the others.

He was weird and unstable.He was radioactive.His longest-lived isotope has a half-life of just 4.2 million years, almost one-1000th of the age of the earth. This is what made him so difficult to be found in a natural environment. He tried to be like his siblings, forming similar compounds (halides, oxides, hydrides, complex ions, etc.), exhibiting variable oxidation states, and imitating the appearance of his glamorous cousin, Platinum.But no matter how he tried, he could never garner the attention of the stylish friend of his siblings, the mining industry, because he was almost never found in nature. In fact, most of the several tonnes of Technetium produced annually come from one source-Yes, when all his siblings have their magnificent origins in the Earth’s crust, he finds himself coming from waste matter. No wonder that he comes off as shy, awkward, and doesn’t usually show himself up with his well-known cousins and siblings.But, is that all about him?No, his origins never stopped him from becoming what he was destined to be.So, even in spite of all his weird characters, Technetium still manages to find a way to make himself useful to humanity.Technetium is a nice element.

25,"Well, let’s think about it for a bit.What kind of technologies have been invented in the last century?We have things like radar, and microwave, and the internet, and satellites and computer chips, and nuclear power, and canned food, and drones, and aviation technology, and GPS, and infant formula, and indexing of websites for search engines, and bar codes, and touch screens, and vaccines, and windpower, and the accelerometer, and fire resistant clothing, and aerodynamic trucks, airbags, miniature cameras that fit in a webcam or cellphone, weather forecasting, and submarines, cellular technologWell, let’s think about it for a bit.What kind of technologies have been invented in the last century?We have things like radar, and microwave, and the internet, and satellites and computer chips, and nuclear power, and canned food, and drones, and aviation technology, and GPS, and infant formula, and indexing of websites for search engines, and bar codes, and touch screens, and vaccines, and windpower, and the accelerometer, and fire resistant clothing, and aerodynamic trucks, airbags, miniature cameras that fit in a webcam or cellphone, weather forecasting, and submarines, cellular technology and networks, RAM memory, hard disk drives, liquid-crystal displays, lithium batteries, so on.But all that kind of stuff was developed by having governments getting involved, funding research and science and so on.Which, as we all know, is a really inefficient method, it pretty much doesn’t work.Instead of this inefficient method that clearly doesn’t work, of having governments take part in research and development, we now have a much better strategy for innovation:Random guys in their garage!As we all know, that’s where all the true innovation comes from, random middle class dudes, who have ideas, and then do a startup in their garage.Either that, or huge corporations who invest in ways to extend their patents.So now, we have much more groundbreaking innovation.We have things like Amazon, who patented and made a fortune off one-click buying, the truly revolutionary idea of not making people click more than needed.Do you really think that government could have ever come up with a brilliant idea like that, huh?",0 followers,Lucas Martin,6.4K,65,4.2M,2020,https://www.quora.com/How-did-the-Mole-Man-get-advanced-technology-resembling-a-holodeck-back-in-Fantastic-Four-296
