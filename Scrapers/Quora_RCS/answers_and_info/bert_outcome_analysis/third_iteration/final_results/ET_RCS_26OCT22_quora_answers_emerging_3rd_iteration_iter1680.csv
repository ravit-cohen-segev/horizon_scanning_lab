Membership in these organisations may also get you on the mailing list for upcoming conferences. You can also search the blogs of eminent big data persons for names of conferences and try to find out where the conference will be next year. As I see it, the problem is not finding conferences but distinghuishing the good from the bad. for this, professional societies and trusthworthy bloggers are good filters.","99,912 followers",Alcatraz Dey,526,1.4K,68.2M,2011,https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-find-upcoming-technology-conferences-to-speak-at
1,Lets see - I’ve done this 4 times in my career. The 1st time was shock by my boss and the entire company was in shock for a couple of days. My boss tried to change my mind but I was pissed off and wouldn’t. They tried to schedule an exit interview to determine why I was leaving but my boss left an insulting message with his secretary for me. He said something more important had come up than our meeting (his boss was also flying in)so we needed to re-schedule. I apologized for the message I told his secretary to give him.

They were pissed that I left but hired presidents quickly.The fourth time was after a company that I loved had a secretive downsizing that affected Directors that reported to me. I was the VP and CTO. When they told me they added marketing and sales to my functions. They told me to “ take it or leave it”. I was shocked. I took it for about 8 weeks and quit on a Friday and joined a competitor on the following Monday. They were shocked.,UNKNOWN,David Butler Sr.,1K,1.2K,1.2M,2020,https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-find-upcoming-technology-conferences-to-speak-at

And If you think you can make the needle in your home.Now let me explainMechanical engineering is the discipline that includes/ involves/ combines/ overlapsmore than 30 disciplines.Future of Mechanical engineeringElectric VehiclesReplacement of the traditional internal combustion engine with cleaner, battery-powered systems brings new challenges regarding torque and energy loss, and the design of mechatronics to support new electrical system.Furthermore, as vehicle manufacturing becomes more automated, mechanical engineers will be front and centre in the design of robotics andNanoengineeringNanotechnology refers to the manipulation of materials at the smallest level. This rapidly growing field is one that offers abundant opportunities for mechanical engineers.In the years ahead, mechanical engineers are expected to be integral in using nanotechnology to:BiomechatronicsThe role of mechanical engineers in robotics is taken a step even further with the rapid growth of biomechatronics. This field, which seeks to merge body and machine, involves the design and testing of complex and intricate device architectures that mimic the body’s musculoskeletal design.Mechanical engineers will be primarily involved in the design of mechanical sensors, controllers, and actuators for biomedical devicesManufacturingManufacturing is an ever-evolving field. Mounting pressures to increase production efficiency while minimizing operating costs have fueled demand for new and innovative technologies.Automation and roboticsNon-of the engineering is dead end...Edit:1.0For people in the comment section asking the reason for high unemployment for Mechanical Engineers. To answer the questionThe Problem of unemployment is not only with Mechanical Engineers, but with the whole Industrial Sector.A lot of Electrical Engineers and Electronics Engineers are working in IT Services like TCS, Infosys, Wipro, CTS, IBM etc.Many Civil and Mechanical Engineers are either working in Banking Services or pursuing Teaching in Coaching Classes.Some are selling Credit CardsFortunate Ones are going to US, Germany, Netherland to pursue M.S.The reason for this is, after Independence Indian economy has shifted gradually from Agriculture Sector to Service Sector (be it formal or Informal) leavingAccordingly the Share of Workforce in the Industrial Sector also remained Stagnant.However, Total no of Engineering graduates each year has risen drastically leaving many graduates unemployed.As per National Employability report engineers annual report 2019, Approximately 80 percent of Indian engineering graduates are not employable in the current knowledge-driven economy. This signify the pathetic condition of engineering education in India. Some major initiative in the direction of quality of education, is the need of the hour.What are Future Prospects of Industrial SectorIt has already been perceived our Government that Industrial & Manufacturing growth is the best route for overall economic development.Make In India, Skill Development, Start-up India, Stand-up India, Entrepreneurship Skill Development Program are some of the examples.Under Make in India thrust sectors have been identified to provide a push to manufacturing and Start-up India to strengthen the start-up ecosystem.The Ease of Doing Business initiative aims to create a conducive environment by streamlining existing regulations and processes and eliminating unnecessary requirements and procedures.Foreign Direct Investment policy and procedures have been simplified and liberalised progressively.Hope Future Industrial Sector is Bright, Everyone will be Employed !.Thank you Ayana Vini for pointing this out..Edit-2.0For people contending that the rate of innovation in Computer Science and Electronics is much higher and there is very less innovation in Mechanical engineering.I agree that the rate of innovation in computer science and electronics is far than the mechanical engineering.I totally agree.However, There is a world beyond the computer too. We can not eat data, we can not wear motherboard and we can not brush our teeth with a transistor & we can not drive a mouse.What i mean to say that for the innovations in computer science and electronics to use practically we always have to have a base. Where will we use those innovations ?? We will use these innovation in electronics over a car, or robot, or drone or rocket or spaceship or aeroplane , helicopter, fighter plane or any other equipment which must have a chance of using Mechanical engineering and we can witness the innovations in these technologies, can’t we?The rate of innovations in computer science and electronics is higher because these are new for the humanity. Both came into existence in the later 20th century and innovation has just picked up in the last decade. Hence, everything is new for us and we are able to perceive the little changes in it. Like after every 6 months we see a new smart phone with some new technology. There are millions of Applications releasing everyday. It looks quite fascinating to us, isn’t it ?However, we have been unable to see the innovations in materials. We don’t know about carbon fiber. We have ignored these innovations in Biomechanics.AWe have no idea about innovation in the field of Fluid dynamics because we can not feel it.There are innovations in mechanical Engineering too.The world is dreaming about a flying car, an smart robot, smart machines, and smart materials.There are huge innovation in nanotechnology, robotics, biomechanics going on.And i hope that in the NEXT EPIDEMIC like CORONA virus our worriers will be smart robots equipped with artificial intelligence ( off course credit goes to computer science), who will be carrying the infected to the hospitals and operating them.And in the coming time biotechnology is going to take over both Computer Science and Electronics Engineering as world has started witnessing biological warfare.Where as Mechanical Engineering will keep growing with the slow pace like a tortoise!Regards,ReferenceImage Source -phone gallery & GoogleMechanical engineering - Wikipedia4 Things to Expect for the Future of Mechanical Engineeringhttps://www.gedcouncil.org/sites/default/files/Engineering+Education+in+India+Dec1608-1.pdfDATA STORY | 80% of Indian engineering graduates not employable, says surveyIndia struggles but Bangladesh's GDP rides high on manufacturing, export boomKey Initiatives for Industrial Development Post GST and Demonetisation",0 followers,Lucas Martin,6.4K,65,4.2M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-upcoming-technologies-in-SAP

The next year we met the pioneers of this technology, and in 2017 progressive Web Applications seem to have become the major competitor of native mobile apps.Progressive web appsOnline customer support2016 was the year of chatbots. 2018 will be the year of helpful chatbots. Since there are thousands of bots out now, the quality of their services will be the next web development trend.The prediction is that 85% of all customer interactions will proceed without human assistance till 2020.A customer service chatbot becomes a must on almost every website. Whether you are selling electronics, crocheted toys or software development services, you should have a chatbot.Static websitesYou definitely remember the concept of a static website from the early years of the World Wide Web. All the first websites on the Internet were static.But then the era of dynamic websites began.Websites became more functional and easier to update even for people with no technical background. At the same time, the development process became more complicated, as the extended functionality required communication with the server, so backend development got involved. Modern CMSs are the actual dynamic websitesNowadays, the web is returning to its roots. Static websites are becoming the web development trend of 2018 again.Single-page websitesAnother web development trend for simplicity is single-page websites. This solution allows putting all the content onto one long scrollable page, removing any clutter.One-page websites have a bunch of advantages. They don’t challenge the visitor with complex navigation, multi-level menu, and tons of text. The essential information is all on one page. The user only has to scroll to it.Of course, the use-cases of single-pagers are limited. This type of website will not suit e-commerce projects and blogs. At the same time, businesses can significantly benefit, presenting their services in a simplified and more engaging manner.Push notifications for websitesMobile apps notifications turned out to be a highly efficient means of user re-engagement. And recently this idea has been implemented for websites and is becoming new web development trend.The workflow looks quite simple: the user visits a website and is offered to enable push notifications. The user will then be notified of any changes on the website (like a new blog post or a private message), even after he has closed the tab with that website.The major benefit of such a technology is obvious - you can keep the user engaged without big efforts.Flash to HTMLIn 2010 Steve Jobs published hisThe major weakness of this technology is the incompatibility with mobile devices. An enormous amount of traffic is lost just because of the outdated technology.Motion UISimplicity is the trend in recent years. This is also true for web design. Users are already tired of crazy GIFs and flashing ads, that’s why websites with moderate design get more appreciation.At the same time, sophisticated motion UI is becoming more popular. Animations allow to add more style and enable you to distinguish your website from the thousands of others with the static UI.There are several ways to add some life to your minimalistic website. Consider page header transitions, nice hovers, animated charts, background animations and modular scrolling. These and many other elements may make your web presence much more enjoyable for users. The true artwork!JavaScript - Angular 2 and Angular 4JavaScript is the number one programming language for web applications. With dozens of JS-related technologies already existing and still in development, it will even strengthen its positions. The highly anticipated release of the last years Angular 2 becomes highly appreciated in modern web development.We met Angular 2 in 2016. It is a complete rewrite of the AngularJS framework. The main advantages are improved modularity, app architecture scalability,PHP 7.x - Laravel 5.xPHP remains the popular choice for website backend development. This programming language has improved its positions even further after the release of version 7.x. The latest update of the PHP framework Laravel 5.x is a recognized web development trend in 2018.Laravel is the most popular open-source PHP web framework. All the benefits of it can be fully experienced on dynamic websites with complicated backend.Laravel offers ready solutions for complex tasks. The variety of existing packages makes the development process faster and more reliable. Regular updates ensure that the framework complies with the current needs of the website owners and the requirements of the time.Also I decided to describe the anti-trends of the year as well.
