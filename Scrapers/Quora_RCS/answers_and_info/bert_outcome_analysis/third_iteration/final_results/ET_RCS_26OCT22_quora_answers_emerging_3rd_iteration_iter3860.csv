I could be wrong but I think the answer to your question at least in the current environment is sadly never. There is no question a supersonic transport can be built. Concorde worked and current technology could certainly allow a son of Concorde. The problem is largely environmentalism and to a lesser degree economics.A supersonic transport has to satisfy environmental constraints - takeoff noise, ozone depletion, CO2 per passenger mile, sonic boom, NOX emissions to name a few.

I could be wrong but I think the answer to your question at least in the current environment is sadly never. There is no question a supersonic transport can be built. Concorde worked and current technology could certainly allow a son of Concorde. The problem is largely environmentalism and to a lesser degree economics.A supersonic transport has to satisfy environmental constraints - takeoff noise, ozone depletion, CO2 per passenger mile, sonic boom, NOX emissions to name a few. The physics of supersonic flight make it difficult if not impossible to satisfy these while maintaining economic viability. For example the stuff hung on the back of the engine to suppress takeoff noise weighed as much as the engine in 1990s studies. Further when I worked on HSCT in the 1990s noise became a real headache because every time we thought we had it solved the powers that be moved the goal posts. If you manage to solve all these problems and develop an airplane that isn’t viewed as elitist economics still have to be addressed.A supersonic airplane depends on attracting premium fares and the fact it will generate more passenger miles per unit time and thus more revenue than a subsonic airplane. Another issue is that the passenger cares about block time rather than speed. Suppose I want to fly from London to Los Angeles. Would I prefer to do it in a 787 with one 2 hour check in in London for a block time of say 12 hours or supersonic London to NY and then subsonic NY to LA. The block times with the layover would be about the same. It may not be the best example but the introduction of the 787 with a high level of passenger comfort and the ability to do point to point flights almost anywhere in the world makes very stiff competition for an SST. The internet also provides significant competition since it reduces the need to get anywhere much faster than a 787 can achieve.At the moment industry seems to be pursuing hypersonics in research programs but I think this is a bit of cover for the military interest in it and a way to keep technical teams up to speed. I find it hard to believe we’ll see hypersonic commercial vehicles before supersonics and the latter I don’t think we’ll see in our lifetimes. A supersonic business jet which might evolve into a small capacity premium fare plane for a limited number of routes - London NY for example - might easily happen if it can evade the environmental restrictions.",12 followers,John Cate,595,14.4K,186.1M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Is-there-any-possibility-of-supersonic-aircraft-like-Concorde-coming-back-into-the-aviation-industry-with-more-advanced-technologies
1,"The Concorde was always a controversial aircraft. An engineering triumph for Britain and France, but suffered delay and cost overruns. At the time it was set to revolutionise air travel with the ability to fly two and a half times faster than even current airliners. However the increasing cost and the fact many countries would not allow it to overflying major populated areas supersonically because of the sonic boom. This resulted in the envisioned sales of 300 plus becoming just 14. Only 20 where ever builtThe Concorde was always a controversial aircraft.

Only 20 where ever builtThe crash of Air France 4590 in 2000 was the first loss of that type after over 30 years since first flight, which is quite remarkable. The accident investigation, pretty much came to the conclusion that a tyre blew out due to hitting debris on the runway and ruptured a fuel tank. Although modifications, in the way of kevlar inserts in the wing fuel tanks provided the solution for a repeat occurrence, they added substantial weight and made the already marginal aircraft even less economically viable. Add to that the airframes where getting old and older aircraft cost more to maintain and then the major downturn in confidence in air travel caused by 9/11 and the economics just became unsustainable.

5,"Technology plays greater and greater role in fire science. Infra red and satellite mapping locate hot spots, making it possible to pinpoint water drops. Fuel moisture content is measured and fire risk can be calculated in real time. Entymologists are identifying and tracking imported pests and working on ways to combat them. Every bit of technology available is being employed in fire prevention and fire fighting.Natural variables and human behavior get in the way and cannot always be anticipated or mitigated.
