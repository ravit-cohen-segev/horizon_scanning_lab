2,"Think about what separates us from people thousands of years ago, hundreds of years ago, in the 1500s. What have we achieved?Surprisingly, nobody has mentioned the invention which we probably rely on near to the most these days.Think about this, what inventions were necessary for you to be reading this right now?Now, did anybody consider the battery?These odd devices power our phones, our laptops…. and none of this technology would even be possible if it weren’t for the battery.Let’s go back a couple of hundred years to the pre-1800s, when the battery had not yet been invented.

Since we didn’t have a way to store electricity, we could not analyse its behaviours - and, therefore, we could not explain electrical properties - which would lead to the invention of new electrical/electronic devices. We wouldn’t have electric inter-communication, wireless well- anything, this would be a much older time to live.In the yearThis led to a greaterIn 1821,The motor used a bath ofThe firstThis motor design was then improved upon until it was discovered that the process wasTo keep this answer concise, I will quickly summarise the remaining major inventions:In 1833, Farraday invented the thermistor and the laws ofMoritz von Jacobi created the first ‘real’ rotating electric1836 - Nicholas Callan invented the electric1837 - Edward Davy invented the1844 - The first electrical1845 - Kirchoff developed -non-other-than-1855 - First utilisation of1873 - Zenobe Gramme discovered that his DC generator could be used as a DC motor (developing the first1877 - Thomas Alva Edison invented the1877 - Werner von Siemens invented the1879 - Thomas Edison patentedMost modern electrical inventions, such as semi-conductor usage and components were developed in the 1900s.And that is a brief summary of what the invention of a battery led to.Thank youPhoto References:Further reading:",46 followers,Chandrasekar Sankar,9.3K,0,0,2022,https://www.quora.com/What-are-recent-advances-and-inventions-in-the-medicine-field
3,"At the hospital I work at…we see to many cases of suffocation, joking, copd..etc..I would love to see a portable device that could be placed on a person arm, neck, leg etc..that would connect to the arterial system and supply oxygen to the blood while being transported to the hospital…saving the brain from damage while medics or doctors work to repair the damage..we see large devices such as heart lung machines etc…so yes I would like to see some form of that in a portable system, that a novice could use…say in schools for child coking events….or permanent use as in copd","5,360 followers",Valerio Cietto,677,2.4K,9.1M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-are-recent-advances-and-inventions-in-the-medicine-field
