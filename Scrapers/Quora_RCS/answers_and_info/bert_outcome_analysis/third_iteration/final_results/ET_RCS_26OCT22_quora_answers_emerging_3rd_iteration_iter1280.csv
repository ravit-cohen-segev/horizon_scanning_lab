0,"“Most Plausible”?An interactive computer that takes verbal input and can differentiate for syntax, grammar, dialect, etc and follow commands as well as responding to investigative queries with relevant information.This seems small, it's really not. The idea of a starship/base main computer that is THIS interactive AND accurate is astounding.But I do believe it's very possible, if someone were to invest the time, money, and effort into building it.Other technologies may have some merit, but this is “Most Plausible” to me.","5,243 followers",Janet Ybarra-Nance,988,6.3K,14.6M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-technology-from-Star-Trek-could-be-a-reality

2,"It seems to me (having been at one) that between technical disruption, regulation and sheer incompetence that banks are in big trouble.The key with banks today is the requirement of in-person identification (KYC requirements) and if that is solved with technology, then why would anyone ever go into a bank again.Apple changed electronics retailing, why haven't banks changed the bank branch since 1968.  Internet banking, mobile banking and now Mint and others really beg the question of what a branch is for.","135,501 followers",Hector Quintanilla,950,1.2K,88.5M,2011,https://www.quora.com/What-technology-from-Star-Trek-could-be-a-reality

5,"It’s hard to say what will happen next, as technology is ever-evolving, there will always be new tech emerging on the horizon.However, the past has shown us that not every emerging technology can remain relevant, much less disrupt entire sectors of the economy.

8,"Not a lot if any. The “smart gun” is a bad joke that adds complexity or, as my granddad put it, more shit to mess up. The single most critical part of gun safety is the shooter. It doesn't matter how many high tech bells and whistles you put on a gun if the shooter doesn't practice the fundamental rules. The actual incidence of firearms accidents, while still too many, is really small given the number of firearms and practically all could be prevented by good practices. Engage brain before handling anything potentially lethal.",878 followers,Randi Welter,1.8K,8.7K,3.7M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-technology-from-Star-Trek-could-be-a-reality
9,"Sabrina, (thanks for the A2A), when you stop and think about it there’s a lot of technology that goes into any firearm. The chemistry involved in the powder, the geometry involved in proper sighting components, the modern machining methods involved in the metal work, the science involved in grip angles and even polymer plastics chemistry in the grips themselves, it all involves science and technology, What an amazing thing a modern gun is. especially when you stop and think of the earliest “hand gonne”, not much more than a small cast metal object shaped like a cannon with a cast iron grip onSabrina, (thanks for the A2A), when you stop and think about it there’s a lot of technology that goes into any firearm. The chemistry involved in the powder, the geometry involved in proper sighting components, the modern machining methods involved in the metal work, the science involved in grip angles and even polymer plastics chemistry in the grips themselves, it all involves science and technology, What an amazing thing a modern gun is. especially when you stop and think of the earliest “hand gonne”, not much more than a small cast metal object shaped like a cannon with a cast iron grip on the back and a burning cotton match (more like a wick) used to set off the powder in the touch hole.The one thing that has never changed, that hasn’t been technologically reinvented, is my ability as a firearms owner to use my firearm myself, then safely pass it to someone else to use, who can then carry it across a room or even down the road a mile or two and hand it to yet another person who can successfully fire it. There are times when that can become very important.The key to firearms safety isn’t in technology. All of my firearms have safeties enough, even if they are double action only, to protect me and others if they are dropped or fumbled. The big key to safer firearms lies in education. Education on safe gun handling is important even to the the die hard “I’m scared of guns and don’t want to live in a world with one” set. Everybody, no exception, EVERYBODY should have a firearms safety class at an early age, to learn safety and to become comfortable in a world where firearms are a reality. You never know when you might be the most responsible person in the room and something about a gun comes up. You as an individual need to know how to handle taking care safely of that issue. If you live by a lake you would want to know something about water safety. You live in a world with firearms, isn’t it better to really know something about there safety? Or would you rather just go on along with kicking kids out of school for pointing a finger.It’s the human intelligence part of firearm safety that needs to advance in the next ten years, not the technology. Why rely on technology to take care of an issue that your brain can already handle better?Thanks Sabrina, for your A2A",UNKNOWN,Kitten,890,502,7.5M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-technology-from-Star-Trek-could-be-a-reality
10,"Guns are about as safe as they can be. Which is to say gun design has evolved to a stable state.Imagine if you will, a hammer. You see it clearly in your mind. It is an evolved tool.

The only reason to redesign either is to make it idiot proof, which means lowering the skill level of people who ...",0 followers,Branislav Hatala,864,116,245.5K,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-large-companies-will-be-majorly-disrupted-by-the-internet-or-other-technology-in-the-next-5-years
