Increased visibility often reduces uncertainties by revealing obstacles which would have remained unrecognized.Some of these measures are destructive, though, so they have to be used accordingly and swapped for a better way where possible. This then raises ethical issues.If the answers are unknown, does it make sense to identify all of the problems? OrTough question and a perennial one it seems. Increased visibility often reduces uncertainties by revealing obstacles which would have remained unrecognized.Some of these measures are destructive, though, so they have to be used accordingly and swapped for a better way where possible. This then raises ethical issues.If the answers are unknown, does it make sense to identify all of the problems? Or will that affect the search so that they may better know what to put resources into? Are there some things that will never be resolved?There is no hope of advance or improvement if there is no attempt. Say ancient Athens decided that those other cities were always going to be in conflict and they wanted to reduce casualties instead so they could toss ideas about democracy and government and stick with what they had. This seems like an absurd comparison, but someone is going to think they see a better path and opt for it so the rest are going to have to react. Or Benjamin Franklin wanting to prevent the congregation sites from being incinerated by lightning and look at all of the places where that discovery has led. It is nice if they can discuss it beforehand.As it is what they tend to do is predict and try to accommodate what they see as the stakes. Maybe in a while the context will have shifted so that the same fears are not predominant and they can take a saner route.So the threats are defined by the sense as it were. Tossing the appendages only leaves them in the void.They might have said something similar about the population rise, or the economic growth, or the exploration of space, or the makeup of matter. These might be considered successes from another angle. The analogies are usually to the early phase and the later eras. This is an appeal to emerging wisdom. Unfortunately they may have learned by trial and error since this started without understanding their own nature, nurture, and so on. Each is going to blame the other. That latter notion is also interesting because it encompasses everything that is not the self.If there was a way to get on top of it, then they may not see it as so alienating and it might not make them as reflexively defensive. At least they would have a shot at considering the consequences.Another assumption is that the set of hazards is going to be constant when that might be out of control and possibly increasing at times so anything that they could bring to bear at the right moment would be advantageous. Nature was not the friendliest thing in the past either. What is going to be the way to address that otherwise?T...",0 followers,Lucas Martin,573,65,4.2M,2017,https://www.quora.com/Should-technologies-stay-the-same-as-it-is-right-now-due-to-their-upcoming-threats
1,"I think so since I believe that all futuristic stuff like AI robots, self-driving vehicles, drones, etc. (other than tablets and computers) would all cause negative impact to most humans, even taking away jobs from humans (thus making humans obsolete and possibly make humans loose money, causing them to become homeless and hungry), injuring/killing (probably) millions or billions of humans, etc., maybe even killing off humanity. Spread this to the government to stop advancing the technology we already have.Here's the proof:Robots are a bad ideaAre drones bad for wildlife?Why the U.S. economy sI think so since I believe that all futuristic stuff like AI robots, self-driving vehicles, drones, etc. (other than tablets and computers) would all cause negative impact to most humans, even taking away jobs from humans (thus making humans obsolete and possibly make humans loose money, causing them to become homeless and hungry), injuring/killing (probably) millions or billions of humans, etc., maybe even killing off humanity.

Technology will create a substitute for the teachers, and a modern classroom will be more than a substitute for the teacher.A modern classroom is defined by technology these days. Ever since Educomp in India raised the hooplah ofThere is constant pressure on teachers and administrators to implement technology in classes. There are several advantages of making use of technology in teaching. These advantages being a uniform pattern of class, a similarity of content, identification of problem, scalability of operations and adaptation to swiftness of changes.The question remains – can technology replace teachers ? Well, the answer is clearly no. Though beneficial, technologies can never replace a teacher.No matter how advanced or smart a computer program or a product is, it can never come close to the knowledge and life experience a teacher brings. Several researches have been conducted and it has been proven time and again that teachers bring about a change which no technology can. A teacher simply does not impart knowledge or information. And teaching is definitely not about facts and figures.A good teacher encourages independent thoughts and independent learning. He/she can be a positive influence, can be an inspiration to set and achieve goals. The trust and bond between a teacher and student creates the perfect learning environment; which can never be achieved through virtual learning.The generation today loves technology.New educational technologies will not only energize the students, but teachers as well. Which means,While classrooms cannot function without a teacher, the fact remains that in the near future it will be the other way around too. Facilitating learning through technology presents tremendous opportunity for both the student and the teacher to deepen their knowledge and empower themselves. The teacher will have to become a facilitator of parting trustworthy information from electronic sources to the students. Teachers versus technology are an ongoing battle.Technology plays a supporting role, but it’s the teacher who brings it all togetherAnd as long as the balance is maintained we can expect an education system that not only promotes learning, but also opens doors to creative freedom and expression.In India, it is even more significant that technology doesn't substitute teachers as the value systems are very different. Technology can impart skills, clear some concepts but can never impart values which the teacher can impart. a tech loaded class can impart information but will not prevent the information to be misused by the students.",4 followers,Matthew Bates,718,9.8K,293.1M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Should-technologies-stay-the-same-as-it-is-right-now-due-to-their-upcoming-threats
