1,"The Americans used something never done before- a submarine called the Turtle. It was a very large barrel adapted with a screw propeller, a window, weights, and a large wood screw to attach a mine to an enemy ship. It was propelled by hand, and the inside was lighted by foxfire (glowing rotten wood caused by mold). It made an unsuccessful attack on a British ship, but was defeated by the copper plating on the hull which prevent the screw from penetrating, in NYC, 1776.",0 followers,Oscar Fredrick,2.8K,202,5M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-was-the-highest-technology-used-to-fight-the-American-Revolutionary-War

A nice letter comes back thanking him but suggests that he should take aerospace engineering classes. Years later, the F-16 plane is produced that has many of the same specs and plane shape.Example: A 14 year old boy visits Los Alamos Labs in New Mexico. During a tour, the tour guide asks a question of how to keep plasma particles in a magnetic field where the center of a magnetic donut needs to be sealed. The answer was was provided with no response. About 40 years later the laser fusion project is based on the same principal provided in that same letter.This is also found in today’s corporate management where many are incapable of understanding the technology that they have control over or the capabilities of that same technology.Unless you go it on your own where it takes money and backing to get started, those kind of resources generally come from corporate management and they are very hart to convince.There are many creative ideas that fall by the wayside because of the way society chooses to implement them. It has nothing to do with the idea and everything to do with those who control the resources needed to implement that idea.

SATA was designed many years ago when the limiting speed of harddisks meant that the interface didnt need to allow larger/faster data transfers.Fastforward to today where Solid State Disks (SSD) are more common. SSDs are 10 to 20 times faster than hard disks. This mean that the SATA interface was limiting the speed of the SSD.Enter PCIe an interface that is a lot faster than SATA. PCIe needed a new protocol to access its full benefits, the protocol is NVMe.Summary; IDE to SATA = older and slower.NVMe to PCIe = newer and faster.If you get an NVMe SSD that uses PCIe you are getting the latest technology in digital storage.","246,851 followers",Dushka Zapata,1.5K,8.5K,232.4M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-was-the-highest-technology-used-to-fight-the-American-Revolutionary-War

I asked this daughter (who had never been boy-crazy like her girlfriends nor ever had a boyfriend or date).""Because I've been asking and asking God who I would end up marrying, and this morning when I was praying, he told me I would meet my future husband today!"" she answered matter-of-factly.Needless to say, fear struck my heart. My impressionable daughter believing this crazy idea would make for an interesting - if not scary - day! Today, I would definitely keep her close to me and keep a strict eye on her!That night I knew we had plans to take my daughter and her friends to a haunted house. I asked her if she thought she was going to marry one of her friends. She said ""No, I'm sure it will be someone totally new that I've never met before."" (Yikes, fear again.)Nothing eventful happened all day. But that evening the line waiting to go into the haunted house went down the street and around the block. The kids didn't seem to mind the long wait and goofed around in line and talked to others nearby. I kept a very close eye on my extremely attractive daughter (Come on, I AM her mom, but others think her attractive too). I suspiciously eyed every boy who talked to her!!!Finally, our group of teens got to enter. I was behind the group & directly behind my daughter. Dark, scary, fun, and long was the walk in the pitch-black, winding corridors. Suddenly a man dressed as the Grim Reaper jumped out right in front of my daughter and scared her so badly she screamed and fell backwards - on top of me and those behind me - toppling all of us over! The (now kind & sorry) Grim Reaper helped us all up, and, noting her extreme reaction of fear, he came out of character long enough to offer to sneak us out a side exit. She said 'no, its okay' and we moved on - embarrassed.That night my daughter was SO disappointed when she said ""I was so sure God told me I would meet him TODAY.""Fast forward 10 years. My daughter was the maid of honor for her best friend's wedding and gave a beautiful toast and prayer at the wedding. One of the men attending the groom was from out-of-state and took an interest in my daughter, emailing and calling her after the wedding. Eventually they engaged and married.After they were married, we were sitting around talking and the subject of haunted houses came up. My SIL said he had once helped construct one in an old grocery store building when he spent a year in our town! ""Really?"" ""Yes,"" he said, and I got to be the Grim Reaper for it and carry a fake scythe!""Comparing notes, they figured out that the exact year he had spent in our city was the year my daughter was thirteen! When asked if he remembered an incident at the haunted house with a frightened girl, he wasn't sure - as all young girls scream. But when he heard she toppled me & others over and he came out of character to offer assistance out a side exit, then he said, ""That was you?!? But that was just a little girl I offered help! Usually I pride myself in never coming out of character, but she was so scared and I worried people might have fallen and gotten hurt!"" (Lol Yes, a 13-year-old, 5-foot tall girl IS 'just a little girl' to a 19-year-old, 6 foot 2 inch young man - as it should be!)So my daughter did, indeed, meet her future husband that day!!! Amazing!
