The animation quality has changed cause of new tech thingies (obviously) but in story, i think its kinda the same to me, like the quality is kinda the same.

As early as 1923 they were working on new tank designs, and violating the treaty of Versaille by having a lot of their war machine built elsewhere (some of the allies tripped over themselves to help them cheat for profit, only to see the machines they just made coming right back at them!)They faked simpler design plans to trick the war commissions that oversaw disarmament.By the time Hitler showed up Germany had been secretly rearming for a decade. Then he stepped on the gas pedal.But the Germany superiority came with some drawbacks. If you look at a Tiger vs a Sherman you would say it was a turkey shoot. But as pathetic as the Sherman was, it was produced at a scale Germany couldn’t handle, and it’s drive train and transmission was robust. The Tiger broke down and was very difficult to repair.They became obsessed with technical innovation rather than putting the economy on a war footing. They had faith in some wonder weapon that could turn the tide without switching to war production.The V2 rockets and buzzbombs while beyond anything the allies had, were useless. The deaths they caused were minuscule compared to resources used, and were attacking civilian targets anyway. Bizzarre obsessions like having dive bomber capabilities on planes because Hitler wanted it caused ineffective hybrid machinations. They had something like 1500 design of Jeep, and were absolutely obsessed with sidecar motorcycle design and half tracks instead of good troop carriers. They made a tank so huge it could cross any existing bridges. These aren’t coordinated efforts, they are desperation.The allies came up with a slew of innovation as well. Glide path radar, night bombing, magnetic submarine detection systems, initial prototypes of spread spectrum technology, advanced mechanical computers running fire control systems. And of course Colossus. Then all the Hobart funnies from amphibious tanks, anti mine flails, bridge erecting machines, even an experimental ice aircraft carrier that is still sunk in Lake Patricia Canada. Yes, us Canadians were the only people to try and build an aircraft carrier of ice. The proximity fuse was one of the best inventions of the allies. It cut the ammunition needed to bring a plane down by a factor of 10. And in low altitude bursts could increase shell fatality rates by up to 30 times because the detonation altitude was so precise. Germany had nothing on this front. There was an ally “invisibility shield” of sorts. An plane trying to hit a sub on surface would have only moments to catch it before it dived. A Canadian scientist Dr. Edmund Burr discovered that camouflage was more effective by matching the brightness, not the color of the background. The Royal Canadian Navy became the first to deploy cloaking technology in history, cutting German detection range in half. The idea spread to other ships and to the air forces. they equipped some planes with an upwards photometer and under the plane belly lights to illuminate it to the average brightness of the sky. This prevented spotters from seeing the plane as soon as before . An Avenger aircraft was able to get within 2km of a sub in a test without being seen.Germans became pioneers in reconstructive surgery, pinning bones together, but the allies came up with penicillin, vaccines and mosquito repellent and DDT. Sounds weird, but the losses of men to disease in the Japanese campaign were huge due to disease. So medical improvements cut the loss to wars greatest eternal killer, disease.As a child I was told that Germany was a near unstoppable force and we barely won. But, as the existence of Colossus and other secrets came out it seems to me that an allied general would need to be a moron not to win when the codes were decipherable. German was doomed from the get go, they got in some sucker shots, but as England and Russia dusted off and picked them selves up it was over. And then Hitler pops the American in the nose as well.I think German technological capability was also overrated on purpose to sell a narrative to cover up incompetence on the part of Allied command. Seriously, what sounds better.“Well, I had their codes, their equipment was crap and I barely won!”or“We had no idea where they were, where they’d strike or what kind of devilish machines they had contrived. And against all that, I won!”So in the end, they had some very innovative designs, but became obsessed with wonder weapons not proper full scale production. Even if they had got the atomic bomb and hit Paris, London etc with a few nukes, there was no way they could stop the Soviets.","29,946 followers",Tomaž Vargazon,7.7K,7.7K,249.8M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Which-anime-manga-has-the-most-advanced-technology

The British had taken a look at axial-flow designs; decided that the metallurgy to make them work reliably didn’t exist yet; and shelved them until after the war in favour of lower-performance, but more reliable and controllable centrifugal-flow designs that leveraged existed manufacturing knowledge in producing superchargers.",486 followers,Harmen Breedeveld,6.1K,99,1.9M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Which-anime-manga-has-the-most-advanced-technology

Largely as a result of massive family ties within that group. Sweden not only sold steel, ball bearings and Bofors armaments to Germany (and England on a limited scale) but they also permitted the Germans to move massive amounts of troops through the country by train. Iron ore from the far north of Sweden is normally shipped by railroad over the mountains on the border to Norway down to the ice-free harbor at Narvik. During the war British submarines lurking off the west coast of Norway made that a bad idea. Instead, the Swedish mines started shipping their iron ore on German and Swedish ships down the Swedish east coast. They tried to stay close to the shore and screened behind the island chains that line the coast. The Swedish Navy escorted these convoys as far as they could so that British submarines lurking in the Baltic didn’t come after them. Then they had to make a quick dash straight down to a German Harbor on the German Baltic coast.That all changed after the relief of Stalingrad in 1943. By then, the Americans were so emboldened that they walked right in and informed the Swedish government that they had picked one of the Crown estates south of Stockholm (Tullinge, I think) as an advanced air force base from which to continue pounding Germany. They got exactly as they wanted but the war ended before they got going on that project.Sweden, neutral in World War II?

In the final battle, Luke Skywalker flies his X-wing fighter at extremely low level through a trench on the powerful Death Star, in order to fire missiles at the space stations core. His super space fighter is equipped with a navigation and targeting computer. The cockpit display looks like this :This system presumably helps Skywalker to fly as low as possible without hitting the surface. It also acts as a bombing computer, basically telling the pilot when to push the fire button to hit its target. This was 1977 Sci-Fi level technology.Now, twelve years earlier, in 1965, very real US naval aviators, flying the very real A-6 Intruder bomber, were flying bombing missions over North Vietnam. The A-6 had what was called DIANE (Digital Integrated Attack/Navigation Equipment). The pilot’s display looked like this :Instead of looking outside (and seeing nothing, since the A-6s flew at night in bad weather), the pilot watched this screen that clearly - for a trained eye - showed relief and distances. It also conveniently provided navigation hints.This picture actually shows what the late 80s A-6E Intruder Vertical Display Indicator looked like. The Vietnam era VDI was more crude, and at one point orange, I think, instead of green. That being said, it was still an impressive piece of technology for its time :> Kaiser Aircraft & Electronics (now Kaiser Electronics) built the first instrumentation system in the late 1950s. The original operational display presented ground and sky texture to the pilot with a well-defined horizon for attitude, “highway in the sky” for steering and numerous other symbols for execution of various attack maneuvers.“Life of the Intruder”, Naval Aviation News, 1997 [ https://www.history.navy.mil/content/dam/nhhc/research/histories/naval-aviation/Naval%20Aviation%20News/1990/1997/september-october/intruder.pdf ]Here is how Brian Bryans, former A-6 pilot and author of Flying Low, describes the VDI as he discovered it in the mid 60s :> An A-6 pilot had the world’s largest attitude indicator centered on the instrument panel right in front of his face. It was similar in size and appearance to the early TV screens and was called a VDI. It had a pale orange glow and showed an artificial horizon across the middle of its screen with puffy white clouds over it. […] When it got real black outside, you turned up the rosy glow on the VDI and it looked like you were over Kansas on a sunny day. […] The computer generated a curved path on the VDI, so all the pilot had to do was to follow the yellow brick road across “Kansas”.The Terrain Clearance Mode (using the data from the Terrain Following Radar) allowed the pilot to fly low and follow the relief to avoid radar detection and Surface to Air Missile. (The A-6 autopilot could not, as I had first written, do terrain following.)The A-6 also did its own bombing. Once over its target, it told the pilot how it ...",88 followers,Guillaume Lavallée,1.6K,114,712K,2018,https://www.quora.com/Which-anime-manga-has-the-most-advanced-technology

Still does I suppose, but it's 40+ year old tech, from an 80 year old design concept.They might have next gen smart bullets. They might be experimental. The difference in operational, and experimental is simply all out war. They might not acknowledge such a thing, for decades, but bet your ass if we were at war with a near-peer state tomorrow, and such a thing was “experimental” it would find it's way to “operational” quite quickly.My point isn't that they have such a thing, I know people have and will research it. I don't know how well it is (would be) going. My point is rather, if you can think of it, and it lives in the world of scientific possibility, someone else has too. The US military has shown countless times that they can, will, and do produce things beyond our grasp. But these things that seem so far fetched, when released are almost normal here in the States, because on some level Americans expect that kind of thing from history. They will absolutely reveal something akin to the f-117/Manhattan project/ precision munitions/etc. but there's also no telling that its going to be some world-eater weapon. I'd say GPS, among other tech, has just as much profound impact on warfare as the bullets, bombs, and planes. They researched heat and sound weapons for less-lethal options. You never hear about that much. How about the Boomerang (sniper finder)? That's pretty impressive as well.When you field an arsenal of one-off tech, simply because you can, you will undoutably be researching all kinds of “sci-fi” stuff. I guarantee if the military needed lasers as weapons now, they'd have a card up their sleeve.
