4,"As you have likely heard in the past, in order to communicate deeply with others we must first learn to listen deeply.When someone feels heard, and you acknowledge and validate their feelings, it helps them to feel less defensive. When we feel less defensive, we are more open to communicate with one another, because we are not feeling judged. A great way to remove judgement is to be truly curious about someone else's thoughts and feelings.Similarly, offering praise, recognizing, and appreciating all that your partner does will let them know that it's okay mess up or struggle with one thing, asAs you have likely heard in the past, in order to communicate deeply with others we must first learn to listen deeply.When someone feels heard, and you acknowledge and validate their feelings, it helps them to feel less defensive.

In practice, it means to listen carefully to the words and watch the body language instead of trying to put together a rebuttal in your head-Use responses like‚Ä¶‚Äù tell me more‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚Äúthat‚Äôs interesting, tell me what makes you you feel that way‚Äù (it does not mean you always agree, only that you are trying to see where he is coming from‚Ä¶), ‚ÄúCan you clarify what you mean by‚Ä¶‚Äù, etc.-Do your best to listen more and speak less. If you find he is getting frustrated, then suggest you pick it up later.-Don‚Äôt come across as judgemental to his viewpoint. You can always agree to disagree.-Let him know that you care for him and use touch when you see him struggling to communicate or getting overly upset or frustrated.-Remember that sometimes silence is the best communicator.-Use ‚Äútherapeutic communication‚Äù. Never ask ‚Äúwhy‚Äù as it is often perceived as threatening. Use phrases such as ‚Äúyou seem upset‚Äù, ‚Äúdoes it make you sad, angry, frustrated‚Äù (pick one), and wait for a response. Repeat the last part of whatever is being said to let him know you are listening.

One woman is either their wife or long term girlfriend, and second woman is their small time-pass crush.Sisters, such men may approach you emotionally first with their sad stories, stories of how their girlfriend/wife tortures them, how they're leading a loveless life, how unhappy they're, how the sex is missing, how stuck they're, how miserable they're, how lonely they feel, and how they've found their peace in your moonlit eyes and pearly smile and musical laughter. They will bring lovely gifts for you, they will send flirty texts to you, they'll take you to romantic dates, and they'll make you feel like Cinderella.But do not fall for them. It is their trap.The truth is they only love themselves. They don't love their girlfriend/wife, and they don't love you either. When they get bored of their long term woman, they look for a new girl, obviously for short term, so that they can feel that they still have the charm. They'll play with you in different ways, and then they'll move on to their next target in some months.Please, don't become a victim of such men.They will have all the sweet talks and excuses for you. They will make their lady bad in front of you(if they do tell you they're already committed/married), however, just think logically, why is he still with her if she's so bad? Why does he always return to her? When it comes to priority, why he gives her priority over you?Because if you'll compare, he will always choose her and never you. She is his permanent woman, you aren't. He necessarily doesn't love her, but he cannot leave her out of habit. She's his charity case. She is the real victim in this case, stuck with a serial cheater.I have seen three women become victim to such men. I have seen these women destroying their lives, with so many other lives too like their parents, their careers, only for men who were cheating.Please. Don't. Do. This. To. Yourself.If he couldn't remain loyal to his first womanIf you want to choose, there are plenty of great men around us. Men are who are single, men are who are warm, men who're respectful, men who're polite, men who're gentle, and most importantly, men who will remain loyal to you if you both fall in love. Give chance to these nice men. Yes they maybe boring, yes they may not be charming with words and sweet talks, yes they may be men who won't necessarily take you out on fancy dinners and romantic long drives, and yes they may be men who won't gift you white orchids every week.But one man among such true men will definitely be eligible for keeping your heart.Give your heart to such a man.Not to a committed player.

They both are doing their respective jobs in their respective cities.I don't know if his parents know about this or not.I also don't know if his wife knows about this or not.And many would comment under this answer that I shouldn't care much about other people's lives but I'm seeing a young and bright man getting wasted away.And I definitely realize the day his wife will come to know about her husband's addiction, she'll feel cheated and disturbed.Ladies, try helping your man if he feels lonely. Be his family. Lend him support. Talk to him.-But when you are certain it has become impossible to bring him back to life again, I think it's best for you to avoid him and walk away.Avoid men who can't even take care of themselves.Is it selfish?Maybe.But is it going to be worth it?A hundred per cent.","1,715 followers",Zoletta Cherrystone,7.9K,550,2.7M,2020,https://www.quora.com/When-a-couple-each-has-a-very-different-communicating-style-how-do-they-learn-to-really-talk-to-each-other-about-important-issues-in-their-lives

And it was barely a month since we broke up, I was still in the recovery phase and I had to face all the wrath for absolutely no mistake of mine.Thankfully, I had this one friend who wasn't like the others.

I don't share it with anybody unless they're extremely close.The guy was a very trusted friend, and indeed, knew about some of my darkest moments in life.But after the rejection, he chose to let it out and of course, by adding his own twists to it.He portrayed me as an attention seeking whore in front of the entire institute.What kind of men must women avoid?Avoid the ones that can't take rejection sportingly.Sobs!","4,617 followers",Vivek Sampara,3.8K,234,1M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-kind-of-men-should-women-avoid

These stares make girls uncomfortable and are enough to send you chills down the spine.Mom's BoyThese boys are generally good enough with girls. At the same time, this good boy image can be a mirage to his wife who is always been compared to her mother in law throughout the married life.These boys shatter the dreams of their wife who has left her family and is at a new environment and is struggling to gain identity as a family member.RomeosThese guys are the ones who glorify stalking as a great art which flatters a girl. They never realise how offensive it turns put for a girl.Cat on the Wall.On a woman's view, these guys are of no use. They never take a firm stand on a problem and often leave the believed ones at crucial hours. Men of these types are the ones, who abandon their wives and lovers fearing the family and society.Pretending to be Nice.These guys are the dangerous among all. Everything starts smooth at the beginning. Only later, they shed their masks and reveal the true colours. These well-mannered ones ask for nudes to prove a girl's love. They go to any extent and it is on girls part to be cautious.Sexist.Most of the men in this society fall into this. They were brought up as such.Knowingly or unknowingly, the entire society is caught up in this web. The children are groomed with such thoughts and the same is reflected as they grow out. This issue has to be addressed in a more healthier and broader sense.Reckless.These men are never worth one's time and effort to accuse or preach some manners. They go to any limits to prove that girls are always inferior and consider women as mere piece of meat who are created to satisfy a man's pleasure.I would like to mention that these persona are prevalent among all the genders.
