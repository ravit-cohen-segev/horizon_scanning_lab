Because, Java has spread its root in almost all the way, Desktop Application, Web Application, Android Application,  Mobile Application, middle end devices like Routers, Microwaves, Toasters etc. More than 3 billion devices all over the world run Java.Many  tools have been developed on top of Java.Now, if the technology becomes obsolete today also (while there is no sign in the upcoming 5 years), think of the 3 billion devices, which needs to be transformed in other technologies which is not easy stuff to do and will take a long time.So, if you think in that way, JaSurely Java is one of them.

1,"Right now Data Science is growing by leaps and bounds. Previously storing data was costly. Slowly the cost of storing data became cheaper and cheaper so people started storing all kinds of data. This gave rise to Big Data. Big Data has little to do with the actual size of data. Rather it actually means finding value in data where previously no value could be found. Previously when specialized hardware was needed to store huge amounts of data, now commodity hardware can be used to build distributed stores. This allows companies to build data stores with no upper bounds.But what to do with allRight now Data Science is growing by leaps and bounds. Previously storing data was costly. Slowly the cost of storing data became cheaper and cheaper so people started storing all kinds of data. This gave rise to Big Data. Big Data has little to do with the actual size of data. Rather it actually means finding value in data where previously no value could be found. Previously when specialized hardware was needed to store huge amounts of data, now commodity hardware can be used to build distributed stores. This allows companies to build data stores with no upper bounds.But what to do with all this data ? Well Data Science can do a lot. Still Data Science is a very broad term. Few of the things that are currently being done under Data Science arePredictive AnalyticsAnalyze past data to determine past events and try to predict future events. This can be anything from weather, stocks, sports, climate, human resources, behavioral, diseases, etc.Machine LearningMachine Learning can be best described as training an algorithm or a machine to do tasks without explicitly programming it to do those tasks. Rather you program it to look at past data and learn those tasks so when it looks at any future data it can interpret it correctly. Again this can be supervised or unsupervised.BioinformaticsBioinformatics uses coding and big data to analyze biological data for various purposes like finding cure for a disease, understanding a disease better, sequencing genomes, comparing species etc.Artificial IntelligenceArtificial Intelligence tried to create machines that can think for themselves. A couple of fields in Data Science deal with this like the deep neural network and natural language processing.Internet of ThingsRight now we have computers, servers, laptops and phones connected to Internet. However the trend is to connect every device available to the Internet and then make it smart. Today we get washing machines, TV, Toasters, Microwaves, Bulbs, Garage Doors Openers, Cars, etc that are connected to the Internet. These are very well capable of not only communicating with each other but also making your life easier. But all this communication happens through some centralized hub of some vendor and all these devices produce humongous amount of data. This automation and parsing also falls under the domain of data science.True Story: I have setup my car and house so that when I approach my garage, my garage door opens automatically and my house lights turn on IF its night time. It's easy to setup because all can communicate with each other.I hope this answer helps.","1,093 followers",E Douglas Jensen,2.8K,786,3.8M,2016,https://www.quora.com/What-area-or-niche-in-Computer-Science-Programming-do-you-feel-will-have-the-greatest-outlook-between-2017-and-2026
2,"It all depends on what you're interested in. Are you interested in creating Software? Applications? Websites? If you're first able to decide what you'd like to program, you'll be better equipped to find your niche. For instance, I have always loved web development, and so I found my niche quite early - HTML/CSS/JavaScript while I was still in High School. In the years since then, while I've been in college, I've expanded that to include other languages like PHP and Ruby.You have to start small, in an area where you'll be able to see results quickly (not because you should ""take the easy way"",It all depends on what you're interested in.

If that doesn't work, just dive right in and try out different languages until you find one that really speaks to you - you'll find it! It just takes time sometimes.Best of luck!",628 followers,Dipt Chaudhary,9.5K,0,0,2016,https://www.quora.com/What-area-or-niche-in-Computer-Science-Programming-do-you-feel-will-have-the-greatest-outlook-between-2017-and-2026
