No.  You can spend all the money in the world, the baby is going to take nine months to come out, and you end up with a mess if you try to speed things up.Cancer is a family of many, many unrelated diseases, and I've seen nothing to suggest that the issue is one of pooling resources.The other thing is that most science and technology advancements take place in a few countries, so there isn't anything that I can think of that could be done by a multinational consortium that couldn't be done by the US by itself, if it wanted to.",1 follower,Gordon Strathdee,4K,783,12.2M,2013,https://www.quora.com/United-Nations-What-super-big-scientific-advancements-technologies-or-projects-can-be-achieved-by-collaboration-between-the-governments-of-the-world-hypothetically-if-they-pool-all-their-resources-in-a-span-of-five-years
1,"The US is the most technologically advanced nation there ever was, so obviously not! I had the privilege of living there for 4 years in the 90s. It was a little like a sci-fi movie when someone gets transported to the future - I would just wander about gazing at the technological marvels that surrounded me.

Just to pick out some of the highlights:1) Domestic life - I was once visiting a friend’s house and their mother happened to be loading clothes into the washing machine. She turned to me and said, “Do you have washing machines in Scotland?” Obviously, I was forced to admit, that no we didn’t. Instead we just went down to the river and bashed our clothes off rocks to clean them.2) Transport - I spent two weeks in the lovely town of Columbia. Missouri. There I amazed the locals with my insistence on using a strange outmoded form of transport known as “walking”. Locals would slow down as they passed in their modern cars, pointing and laughing. To them, it must have been like watching a live action version of the Flintstones.3) Voting – would you believe it, but in the UK we still vote by drawing a little X next to the candidate we want to vote for. No sign of the advanced electronic voting they have over in the states. Indeed, we are so old fashioned that we haven’t even outsourced our voting to the Russians yet!4) Guns – It may be hard for an American to believe but almost nobody in the UK owns their own guns. This means that if we have to rise up and overthrow our own government (currently seems like a good plan) then we will be armed with nothing more than some particularly well sharpened sarcasm.Still, perhaps one day we can hope to be as advanced as the US. And there is some hope, as we now have our very own version of Donald Trump as PM!4K",469 followers,Daniel Cohort,11.9K,377,1.2M,2019,https://www.quora.com/United-Nations-What-super-big-scientific-advancements-technologies-or-projects-can-be-achieved-by-collaboration-between-the-governments-of-the-world-hypothetically-if-they-pool-all-their-resources-in-a-span-of-five-years

Here's a handy way to think about the hierarchy and accessibility of information in the deep:The surface is what we think of as ""the internet"": the indexed, publicly available portions of the web that you can Google.The first layer of the ""deep web"" is those pages on ""the internet"" that are for a variety of reasons unlisted or restricted-access, rendering them inaccessible to most: members-only, password-protected content, pages that haven't yet been indexed, new pages, and pages that aren't indexed because of DMCA complaints (those in particular can be accessed with a little bit of boolean ingenuity that I'll not go into here).The second layer consists of the sleazy, clandestine, contraband-type stuff that most people think of when they think of the ""deep web"", and it trafficks itself  through anonymizing software (Tor, e.g.), .onion links, and p2p/p2m networks. This is what most people think of when they think of the ""Deep web"". It is difficult to access, is creepy, and is therefore notorious. It consists primarily of pirated software and movies, drugs, guns, gambling, offers of contract murder, and illicit pornography. Avoid it. As a wise man once said, ""nothing good happens in that part of town after midnight"".The third and fourth layers are where you see the bulk of the traffic, and is where the truly interesting stuff lives. Most information on these layers of the ""deep web"" is hidden primarily because it is proprietary or classified. The bulk of deep traffic is on alternate and private networks (that is to say, corporate and government traffic). Layer three consists of classified information trafficked on alternative networks such as JWICS, SIPRNet, and NSANet. The fourth layer is internal corporate traffic hosted on private PANs, WANs and LANs, inaccessible unless you're already inside or that network is otherwise connected to the ""internet"" (the indexed, ""googleable"" surface web that we use every day).This information, by and large, is hidden because it is either useless to most people (or would be already indexed), illicit and therefore clandestine, or would be useful for the wrong kind of people, and hence is limited-access only. There are a lot of high-flung notions about what goes on on the deep web, and they are mostly overblown. There is a lot of sleazy shit available on the deep web, and it's to be avoided, but it represents a relatively small portion of deep web traffic. The majority of traffic is classified and corporate information.","5,990 followers",Jens Böttiger,566,2.6K,17.6M,2012,https://www.quora.com/United-Nations-What-super-big-scientific-advancements-technologies-or-projects-can-be-achieved-by-collaboration-between-the-governments-of-the-world-hypothetically-if-they-pool-all-their-resources-in-a-span-of-five-years
