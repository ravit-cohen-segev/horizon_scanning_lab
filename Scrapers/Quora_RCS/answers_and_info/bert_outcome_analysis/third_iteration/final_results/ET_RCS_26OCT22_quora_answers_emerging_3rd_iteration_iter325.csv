Action expresses priorities. India’s first underwater rail tunnel completed ahead of schedule. The entire project is 16.6 km long, out of which 10.8 km runs under the ground. Of this 10.8 km, 502 metres is under the water. The tunnel is being dug 30 metres below the riverbed. The project connects Howrah to the west and Salt lake to the east. Digging this tunnel was the most difficult and critical task in the entire project. The stretch of 16.6 km will have 12 stations, six of which will be under the ground, while the remaining six stations will be on elevated tracks. Congratulate the engineers & employess of Afcons Transtonnelstroy and Kolkata Kolkata Metro Railway Corporation Ltd!! Thanks me later.3. A solar plant of the size and cost of a center table on your rooftop can insure your home against power cuts and halve your electricity bill. Made-in-IIT solar plant powers thousands of rural homes - smaller and cheaper than present installations. At a cost of Rs 20,000, the rooftop plant and storage system can run couple of tube lights, fans, charging points and a TV. The solar inverterless DC system is cost and energy-efficient as unlike other solar power systems, it does not convert direct current produced by a solar installation into alternate current . A 125W solar installation will require 10sqft space, while 500W requires 50 sqft of space. The system comes with a full DC wiring. A wonderful cost effective solution.4. The Made In India BMM300 clay brick making machine is genius. It cranks out bricks laying them in nice straight rows for easy collection. The production capacity is 300 brick/min. It is the world's only Mobile Brick Making machine. Made in Firozpur Bangur village in Sonepat, it stood 19th among 30 innovations that bagged the DST-Lockheed Martin India Innovation Growth Programme awards for 2016. Congratulate Vilas Chhikara and his team. Thanks me later.5.You can have results or excuses, not both. 13-year-old students from Tamil Nadu designed low-cost toilet urinals using 20-liter waste plastic bottles. Finding the stench that emanated from their school toilet unbearable, students at a government school in Trichy district designed low-cost urinals. The project won the ‘Boldest Idea’ award at the ‘I CAN Awards 2016’ organised by Design for Change. As the cost of installing urinals was high, the boys came up with an imaginative solution. Congratulating the students on their idea, the seller handed over used, damaged, and leaking water bottles free-of-cost. Using funds collected from the students and teachers, they purchased other necessary pipes and parts. To flush the urinals after use, they set up a line of drip irrigation pipes above the urinals. Congratulate the 5 member team – Supikpandian, Santhosh, Dhiyanithi, Ragul, and Prabaharan. Thanks me later.I think i answered this question to some extent.

I didn't even ask.After 1 hour the pantry boy came to collect the money.Me:(how much brother??)Pantry boy:(sir, your bill is 120 rupees.)Me :(I have orderedPantry boy :(yes sir. This is the price of veg meal)I was shocked!!!! How can a veg meal cost this much? Then I said get me the bill then I'll pay you.Then that guy got me a raw bill, nothing is written on that only train number and amount, even catering name was not mentioned. Unfortunately I have lost the bill. Otherwise I would have posted here.Then I paid the money. Without saying anything.After that I thought to check on IRCTC site about the actual cost of the meal.Then I got thisLet me zoom it.This is the veg meal cost . These are the items you are supposed to get in a veg meal.Let's have a look at the price.That’s 50 rupees. I'm not even considering food quality, quantity, and the food they had given.How can they take more than double price of each meal?Just suppose in one coach 60 passengers ordered a meal. They are earning70(the extra cost) * 60=4200 rupees4200 rupees they are earning illegally from each coach .Then I told to that pantry boy “you shouldn't charge more than double cost”. Immediately that pantry boy started arguing with me that sir please have a look at our food quality.I just asked one question,Pantry boy had no answer.I asked him to get out.Then I thought to complain in the railways about the exorbitant price in this pantry.You might not have observed there is a toll free number for complaining about pantry service.This is the number :I just called on this number and put a complaint about this.I would never have thought that they would take some action because this is India. When they took action about it.I realized India is changing.After putting a complaint, within 2 minutes that pantry boy came with a sad face and said, “Sir, have you complained?” in a low voice.I said, “Yes I have complained. So what?”His face became red with fear. Then he started convincing me to take back that complaint.Pantry boy :Pantry boyMePantry boy :Then he returned 350 rupees of 5 passengers extra money who were sitting arround me.This is India’s biggest day light scam.I appreciated that government is changing but corruption can't leave India’s hand.Whenever you are facing this type of problem while travelling please put a complaint on that.NOTE: This answer I had written on 2018. the above information was valid till that time, now the price of IRCTC has changed. The standard veg meal price has change to Rs.80 by IRCTC. please do consider while ordering and putting complaint.I know with one complaint our nation is not going to change.But every single drop of water helps to make a ocean.Thank you for reading……",37 followers,Subham Mahapatra,55.3K,71,3M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-technologies-are-not-available-in-India-but-quite-common-in-top-20-countries

That’s how aptly you can concoct present India’s definition in words. While we are still largely a developing country, there are certain areas where we stand far above the developed nations.1. Legendary Expertise In High Altitude Mountain WarfareSharing borders with nuclear-armed archrivals like China and Pakistan called for impeccable mountain warfare training. So, the Indian army went ahead and became the best in the world. The High Altitude Warfare School in Gulmarg, Kashmir, is so renowned that mighty armies like the U.S., British and German armies periodically come to train with us. Also, the Indian army’s triumph over the Siachin glacier is nothing short of stupendous gallantry.2. Undisputed Remote Sensing CapabilitiesA few decades ago, India was heavily dependent on satellite data from America. As a result of this slow process, 20,000 people died during the 1999 Odisha cyclone. Fast forward to 2015, India’s remote sensing capabilities are far ahead of that of the U.S. Today, we have satellites backing a variety of applications including groundwater prospect mapping, crop acreage and production estimation, potential fishing zone forecasting based on chlorophyll and sea surface temperature, biodiversity characterization, detailed impact assessment of watershed development projects, generation of natural resources data/information, etc.3. Most Intelligent Nuclear Program Using ‘Thorium’While countries around the world struggled to find the replacement for Uranium as a nuclear fuel, India’s nuclear program was already thriving on Thorium. Since India was naturally rich in Thorium deposits, our brilliant scientists made use of it instead of Uranium (Uranium 238) as fuel and surprised the whole world.4. Contribution Of Yoga And AyurvedaDebate this as much as you want but yoga has become a rage across the globe. And who else is to thank but India. Yogananda talked about the physical and eternal benefits of yoga that are now being actively confirmed by modern medical science.5. First Asian Nation And Fourth Country In The World To Reach Mars’ OrbitThe entire world knows about India’s Mars Mission; it needs no introduction. Not only did India become the 1st Asian nation and the 4th country in the world to reach Mars’ orbit but we did it most cost effectively too. At 450 crores, it’s the least expensive Mars orbital mission ever commissioned.6. The Third Largest Army To Walk On EarthThe more you praise the Indian army, the less it seems. With 1,129,900 active troops and 960,000 reserve troops, the Indian army is the 3rd largest army to walk our planet. Also, it’s an all-volunteer force and comprises more than 80% of the country's active defence personnel.7. Second Largest Number Of Internet Users In The WorldOur future rests in the hands of ‘The Internet’ and nobody drives the force of the web other than its users. After China, India has the most number of internet users on the planet. At only 29% penetration, India has 354,000,000 people using the net. This puts us way ahead of countries like US, Japan and Russia where the penetration rate is much higher.8. Nuclear Assets (Weapons And Reactors)In a short span of 66 years, India’s nuclear capabilities have tremendously grown. We rank number one in the development of thorium-based fast breeder reactors; we also have 21 nuclear reactors in operation in 7 nuclear power plants, having an installed capacity of 5780 MW. Six more reactors are under construction. According to Federation of American Scientists, India has an estimated backlog of 75-110 nuclear weapons.9. Fourth Most Feared Air Force In The WorldWith approximately 1,820 aircrafts in service, 905 Combat Planes, 595 Fighters and 310 Attackers, the IAF is the fourth largest air force in the world. This puts us ahead of Germany, Britain and every other developed European country.10. Second Largest IT Industry In The WorldThe growth of the Indian IT scene has been monstrous. Thanks to this growth, our IT sector is the 2nd largest in the world.

If you’re an entrepreneur and haven’t seen the documentary,General MagicPerhaps the biggest and darkest Silicon Valley secret is Digital Magic. If you’re an entrepreneur and haven’t seen the documentary,General MagicMarc Porat’s vision was to create a communication device that looked and functioned very much like the iPhone. Of course, Steve Jobs wouldn’t introduce the iPhone for seventeen years. Marc’s drawings show a handheld computer that included a phone, a touchscreen, and multiple business and gaming applications. Remember, this was before the internet AND before the mass adoption of email. You can say a lot about Marc, but he was clearly a visionary.The General Magic team was star-studded and included superstars likeSomething got lost in the translation…Marc Porat convinced some of the best engineers and developers in Silicon Valley to join his team based on this vision. He convinced the largest technology companies in the world to invest millions based on this vision. He convinced investors to part with hundreds of millions of dollars based on this vision. The problem is that his vision was hijacked. Marc failed to safeguard his vision from well-intentioned saboteurs. His team, working with their corporate partners, built a clunky device that was more like an Etch-A-Sketch than an iPhone. Compare Marc’s original vision and result to Steve Job’s original vision and result for the iPhone.Fewer thanThe proof that General Magic’s failure lies at the feet of its CEO and founder can be found in the fact the team he assembled was able to execute on his vision and their own only AFTER leaving the company. Members of the General Magic team went on to build some of the most successful products and companies in Silicon Valley including the iPod, iPhone, Android, eBay, and Nest. The General Magic team spent $300M over five years to ship their failed device. Compare that to theIn the film, it is obvious that Marc Porat left product development in the hands of his team, who were at the mercy of their various corporate partners. After the company’s IPO the film reveals that Marc attempted to incorporate managers into the development process — efforts that were rebuffed — the team was certain they didn’t need any help to realize Marc’s vision. During the development process, the Internet became a thing and even one of Digital Magic’s interns knew that they ought to incorporate the web into their device. The problem? The internet had the potential to disintermediate AT&T, and as a result of their partnership with the carrier, they weren’t able to incorporate the web into their device. The device that Digital Magic built was basically useless and everyone knew it — sadly no one had the balls to admit it to themselves or to Marc. At the end of the day, the fault is Marc’s and Marc’s alone — he knew the device was crap and should have never shipped it.Your first job as a founder/CEO is to sell your vision to potential employees, investors, partners, and customers.

There is so little corruption in the Singapore government that it is possible to allocate money to something and not have most of it siphoned off by bureaucrats with bad comb-overs and incredibly generous pension plans. So when the government decides to spend money on education, it (gasp) actually goes toAlso, I have noticed some quality controls on the teaching that go beyond what I've seen at other universities. They treat education the way they would treat a manufacturing process. Use quality control; measure everything; fix problems as soon as they are discovered; please the customer; show zero tolerance for lousy teaching; treat course descriptions as a legally binding contract for what will be learned by those who take the course and apply themselves.When professors create final exams, their exams are scrutinized and approved by independent reviewers before they can be given to students.I spoke to one such reviewer, Ed Lazowska, when he was here recently to review the NUS Computer Science Department. He told me he could notThere is also a culture throughout Singapore that being in a STEM (science/technology/engineering/mathematics) field makes you normal, not a geek.

If your pitch was, “I stole this from PDT,” you wouldn’t get very far. If it was, “I invented this myself in my basement,” you wouldn’t do much better. If you set it up and ran it for ten years, and it did well, then you might have a chance, but that takes ten years and isn’t certain; moreover these algorithms take ongoing maintenance.Your best bet might be to try an elaborate scam in which you set up a credible research group, did some work, but then substituted PDT’s algorithm for your own. But that wouldn’t be a tremendous advantage over doing your own research.Nevertheless, the secretive funds make great efforts to protect their intellectual property. Usually only a few top partners know the entire picture, the rest is farmed out in pieces that aren’t exploitable economically on their own. They pay their good people so much that it isn’t worth stealing, and enforce strict contractual protections. They invest in top IT security measures.
