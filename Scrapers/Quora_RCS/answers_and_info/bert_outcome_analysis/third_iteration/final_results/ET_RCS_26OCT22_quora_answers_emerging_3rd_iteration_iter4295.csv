But Mom and Dad trained us to not listen to salesmen, and we train our kids the same way. New products do come out, and some are very good (for instance, facebook was at first - excellent, in fact); but in general,For the same reason that old-time pitchmen got ahold of some rubbing alcohol and some odd-smelling oil, dubbed it snake oil, got up on a soap box and waved the bottle around and yelled about its healing properties until they gathered a crowd.Zuck is desperately trying to get a phoenix to fly out of the rubble of facebook.These comments are strictly my opinion.

1,"There are lots of people that call these new-fangled phones you can put in your pocket “cell” phones, not just old people (unless you consider people in their 20’s old).Let’s start with why they had to be called something different from just “phones.” When they first came out, they didn’t look like iPhones, and they didn’t fit in your pocket. They looked something like this:Think about how your life would be different if you had to carry that around with you all the time!

They looked something like this:Think about how your life would be different if you had to carry that around with you all the time! Those phones were really expensive, and, because of their size and cost, only professionals & executives (and some sales people) who really needed constant contact with their offices really had them — along with rich people, of course.Most people had “regular” phones that looked like this:Or maybe this…Way back in the day, they didn’t even have buttons, and looked like this…Before that even, they didn’t even have dials…You’d pick up the ear piece on the left and talk into the mouth piece and ask an operator to ring the person to whom you wanted to speak. (That was even before my time!)So when these new-fangled portable phones came out, all of these “home” phones became known as “land lines” because they were all connected to wires that ran either over or under land. The portable phones, however, transmitted radio waves between towers similar to this one…The radio waves were relatively short, however. In order for the signals to get from your phone to your friend’s phone would require multiple towers unless your friend lived close by. So the areas the towers covered became known as “cells.” In order to distinguish the new-fangled phones from land lines, they were called “cell phones,” a term many people still use today (not just old people).","220,605 followers",Franklin Veaux,587,47.3K,782.8M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Why-is-the-Metaverse-marketed-as-something-revolutionary-mystical-something-out-of-this-world-if-the-Metaverse-is-based-on-VR-AR-which-are-decades-old-technologies-that-are-marketed-as-revolutionary-but-dont

Transactions always go through (as long as you pay the TX fees), and nobody can touch your account (it’s secured by cryptography, you either have the key or you don’t).Pretty revolutionary, if you ask me :) It’s basically like cash, in that you don’t have to trust anybody, but it works online.","31,158 followers",Phillip Remaker,1.7K,11K,78.8M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Why-is-the-Metaverse-marketed-as-something-revolutionary-mystical-something-out-of-this-world-if-the-Metaverse-is-based-on-VR-AR-which-are-decades-old-technologies-that-are-marketed-as-revolutionary-but-dont
