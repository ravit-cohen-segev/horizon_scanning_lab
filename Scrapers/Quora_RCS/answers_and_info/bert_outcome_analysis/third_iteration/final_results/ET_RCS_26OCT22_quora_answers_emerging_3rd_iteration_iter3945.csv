If ancient peoples had been making CAT scan machines or nuclear-powered aircraft carriers, we would know about it.It's possible that there have been societies that took care of their people better than we do, ensuring that everyone had a vote and access to justice and health care (such as it was).

So it was with the Net.We were building some great pipes to carry information, money, goods and services, infrastructure for the online world. But they were small pipes, mock-ups and experiments really, and they didn’t carry any money.Some of the more visionary people like Steve Jobs, Jeff Bezos, the people who started Paypal, Craig Newmark (of Craigslist), Sergey and Larry at google, the boosters at Wired Magazine, the forerunners of Facebook, the Burning Man crowd, saw that the new technology would make a huge difference to life, money, and culture. We all could, I think. It was inevitable. If you take a sentient species of life and give them the ability to read, type, compute and transmit data, somebody is going to invent the internet.What’s happening today is just that it has come to fruition because everybody now has fast internet access and laws that protect providers against the misdeeds of users. There is a critical mass of support services: geolocation, payments, cloud hosting, micropayments, analytics, development tools. But mostly, it’s because everybody is online and not afraid to use it. So the cool things we did 20–25 years ago for our five hundred friends and five million dollars are now being done for five hundredAs a side note, technology has always been a huge part of the stock market – power companies, railroads, computers, factories, telegraph companies, airplane manufacturers, cash registers, defense contractors, medicine and biotech.

No training, no video calls, no meetings. Most of the companies didn’t exist and those that did were quite different. Amazon was a text book then regular book seller. Kindle didn't exist.

The US army has always been famous for chewing through supplies at a prodigious rate but being able to replace them as much as needed. There would be no supply train or fuel/ammo dumps in ancient Mesopotamia the same way there are now. A modern soldier with no fuel, ammo, or transport is essentially a guy with a fancy club.The second is the whole “take over the world” thing. Let’s say the modern soldiers magically have all the supplies they need. They swoop into Mediolanum, crush all resistance there, raise the American flag, and move on to their next target. What happens when they are gone? The Romans left behind an administrative structure and a garrison in newly conquered lands. Territories weren’t left without a military presence until they had ben safely Roman for a while. Even then there were revolts. Our invincible modern army is going to spend all of its time conquering places, none of which they can hold. And the world is a really big place. Rome was at its peak in AD 100, at which time there were flourishing cultures in China, India, Japan, Africa, the Americas, and so on. All of these places need to be conquered, subdued, and then held. Who is going to do it? Remember that a good chunk of the US military was in Afghanistan for years and the place was hardly pacified. If a people don’t want to stay conquered, and you aren’t there anymore, it is very hard to keep them that way.",0 followers,Pieter,529,4.2K,24.9M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-was-the-peak-of-pre-human-technology

This had holes in. Turn the spindle at the top and the holes align with the pipe allowing water to pass through and vice versa.Some modern valves you get from the hardware shop work the same way and look surprisingly similar.Simple, but to make it work it must be robust and precisely measured. The plug insert has to be a precise fit or it will leak or Caesar up. Ahem sorry,You see, a valve isn't just a valve.If you work back through the reverse butterfly effect of what is required to make a simple device standard across a whole empire that everyone uses, you see it takes a huge amount of collective effort.We have the benefit of fine machine tools, synthetic polymers, stainless steel, a literate population that can read and count, standardized factories. Decades of craftsmen and engineers talking with each other, comparing designs, sharing best practice.You need people to travel to demonstrate to craftsmen what is required. To travel you need efficient transport, or at least roads, and therefor a robust government administration to put that in place.You have to have literacy and numeracy to a degree, otherwise you will have simply a hundred differing artistic interpretations of “valve”, not an empirical design.You need enough of the workforce producing enough of a food surplus that a segment of the population can specialize in making stuff that isn't food. Like valves.All this has to be in place first.Rome, at its heart, was a slave owning economy based on simple agriculture. Human and animal muscle power drove it, and the wind helped blow its ships. In that respect it was little different from the Minoans, Egyptians, Assyrians or any other nameless, ancient culture.And yet the pre-industrial Romans managed to coordinate themselves to such a degree that small groups of craftsmen, as far apart as northern England and Egypt, with hand tools in simple workshops, could produce a standard device that could, literally, plug into a standard plumbing system in different corners of the empire.We picture the great aqueducts sweeping into the cities dumping water into troughs while the eager plebs gather around with their buckets.In actual fact it was a lot more elegant, and indeed modern, than that.",22 followers,Spencer McDaniel,2.1K,2.1K,61.5M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-was-the-peak-of-pre-human-technology
