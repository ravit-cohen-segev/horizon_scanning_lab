Broadcast communication is “to the air”, not connection-oriented, and not acknowledged. All airliners have ADS-B, and many small planes are equipping themselves with it.Airplanes that have older transponders report their identity and altitude, while their position is determined by ATC via primary radar. They still return a radar signature (as any metal object in the sky in that position would), but I strongly doubt that any ATC radar is designed to identify planes by radar signature.Here is where people get confused, because we callOn oceanic routes, ADS-C can be used, which is a two-way, connection-oriented protocol with acknowledgements. In ADS-C, a plane needs to log in and log out of an ATC facility. Planes still determine their position autonomously when reporting to ATC.Communication with ATC might happen via satellite, but at no point “ATC asks a satellite where a plane is”.I’m resisting the temptation to add more content: there is no point in duplicating information that is already easily available in Wikipedia and on Quora.Radars that are designed to identify planes by radar signature are typically not associated with ATC functions… more with air traffic denial functions. Missiles.It is entirely possible that there are satellites in the sky that host a radar capable of identifying planes by radar signature and reporting their position to whomever spent billions to design and launch them.I and you will never know what satellites can do that, who put them there, and how much of our tax dollars were used to do that.","11,603 followers",Tim Hibbetts,503,2K,41.3M,2017,https://www.quora.com/Is-the-new-Earth-satellite-imagery-real-time-technology-being-used-in-aviation-yet-Do-you-think-it-will-replace-radar-for-air-traffic-controllers

Our team at Grammarly has compiled a handy list of common grammatical errors to help make your writing accurate, clear, and professional.Ambiguous (“Squinting”) modifiersA squinting modifier is a misplaced modifier that, because of its location in a sentence, could modify either the phrase that precedes it or the one that follows it. In the example sentence, is the subject listening to music slowly or slowly getting a headache? To correct a squinting modifier, move its position in the sentence to clarify to the reader which word you intend to modify.Misuse of lie/layIf you plan to place or put an object somewhere, such as a plate on a table, you should use “lay.” If you intend to stretch out on a bed for a nap, you should use “lie.” The verb “lie” is an intransitive verb, which means it does not need an object. The transitive verb “lay” requires an object.It may take some getting used to this “lay” or “lie” business; after all, misuse of these verbs is common. But if you remember to lay down your fork before you’re full, then you won’t have to lie down later from overeating.Comma splicesHe was very hungry, so he ate a whole pizza.To splice means to connect or join. When a writer joins two independent sentences with a comma instead of separating them with a period or coordinating conjunction, that’s a comma splice.The comma has its jobs to do, but connecting two independent sentences isn’t one of them. Besides, the period gets testy when his sister, the comma, steals his thunder. Periods have their jobs, and so do commas, but never the twain shall meet—unless it’s in the form of a semicolon. Semicolons can also take the place of a coordinating conjunction, such as “and,” “but,” or “so,” among others.Run-on sentencesRun-on sentences, also known as fused sentences, occur when two complete sentences are squashed together without using a coordinating conjunction or proper punctuation, such as a period or a semicolon. Run-on sentences can be short or long. A long sentence isn’t necessarily a run-on sentence.To avoid run-on sentences, see if there is more than one idea communicated by two or more independent clauses. In our examples, there are two complete sentences:Example:Example:Both sentences are complete ideas by themselves; therefore, use a semicolon or a period to indicate that they are separate independent clauses.Using “could of” instead of “could have”“Could have” is always correct; “could of” never is. Writers probably make this grammar gaffe because, when we speak, the contraction “could’ve” sounds an awful lot like “could of.”TautologiesTautologies express the same thing twice with different words. In our example, the word “made” implies that Jack used his own two hands to create the pail. The prepositional phrase “with his own hands” creates a redundancy. Once you know what they are, it’s fun to discover tautologies: dilapidated ruins, close proximity, added bonus, large crowd...The list goes on and on!After reading through this list of common grammatical mistakes, you might be wondering how to remember all these rules as you write.

6,"I’m more worried that AI and robotsA job is not a good thing, a job is labour you have to do. It’s only the paycheck that’s a good thing. Imagine what you could do if you didn’t have to spend your time toiling away in the salt mines or whatever just to get the money to live.Of course, right now, we only get an income if we have a job or investments. That’s because the stuff we want to buy with our income takes a lot of human labour to produce, and often a lot of investment, so if we want an income, we have to do the labour or supply the investment.

That’s because the stuff we want to buy with our income takes a lot of human labour to produce, and often a lot of investment, so if we want an income, we have to do the labour or supply the investment. But AI, computers, and robots are making a lot of progress, and able to do more and more of the work we need done. There’s still a long way to go before they can do everything we want done. It may take another 40 years, or maybe another 80, but I don’t accept the claim that computers will never be as able as humans. They’re already much smarter than humans in basic mathematical abilities, and their abilities to hold massive amounts of information. They’re already better than humans at the hardest games, like chess, jeopardy, and go. They’re set to replace human radiographers at reading X-rays, and are faster and more reliable than paralegals at legal discovery. They are already assisting doctors at medical diagnosis; how long will it be before they are better diagnosticians than most doctors?What does worry me is that as jobs disappear, and new jobs appear more slowly, the downturn will stall progress on AI and robots, and reduce the rate of productivity growth. We will be in the ironic position of having the technology and capacity to make everything we want, but because we can produce it without a lot of labour, the producers don’t need to pay a lot of people, so the cost of production falls. Prices might even fall, but they won’t fall to zero (remember, there are investors to pay), which is all unemployed people could afford to pay. So what you’ll see is workers who’ve lost their jobs struggling to find a new one because there isn’t much unskilled work available, and what work there is pays poorly, such as gig economy jobs. You’ll see a shrinking workforce, rising income inequality, low wage growth, and low productivity growth (because why invest in raising productivity when wages are stagnant and consumer demand is weak?).So when will this start to happen? Ten to twenty years. Ago. Ten to twenty years ago. Here’s US workforce participation (the proportion of people over 16 in work or actively looking for work) over the last 25 years.and here’s income inequality expressed as Gini coefficient (higher numbers mean more inequality):and real wage growth:and productivity growth rate:So what worries me is that our economic system is failing us, and that the robot revolution, which",26 followers,Balaji Viswanathan,6.1K,5.6K,427.2M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-do-you-mean-by-technology-will-never-replace-great-teachers-but-technology-in-the-hands-of-great-teachers-can-be-tranformational

Is that not wrong? To make it worse, their science has removed many diseases and make it hard for other doctors to get business.

Dammit you scientific people - destroyer of jobs!And the mother of all job killers in humanity was agriculture. General purpose AI and singularity would not even come near the “chaos” that agriculture created. Until 12000 years ago, ourThen these random dudes and dudettes come with their mastery of wild seeds. And before long, food production became a much easy thing. A single farmer in a few acres of land could produce more food than dozens of hunters attacking many square miles of forest. This gave rise to the “Instead of foraging and hunting, most people got involved in other things - like pottery, painting, urban planning, building homes & drainages, administration, mining, jewellery, accounting, medicine…A few thousand years later, another bunch of dudes would start harnessing the power of steam and create “nasty” things like locomotion. Rather than beating our horses to get to the next village, we would get to the other end of the continent reading newspapers. We moved around, explored things. Rather than using little children for many jobs such as chimney sweeping we kept finding better methods. Eventually the horse carriage workers and others moved on to other things.We often confuse general purpose AI with robotics.Let’s assume the worst case and we have a general purpose AI - that can do everything a human can. What would happen?It would be only as bad as agriculture - that destroyed most of what we did everyday. We could be doing things like sports. In most video games, bots are way better than humans. Does it mean we are less likely to play with other humans? In fact, we would play more with other humans just because the bots are better than us.We would do art, psychiatry and so many more human fields that we have not even created. Just like people could not imagine separate professions like art before the invention of agriculture, we have a problem with imagination.And we would spend more time with our children - who often grow alone with their TVs and more time with our parents - who often rot away alone.But, this is assuming there is a general purpose AI. Robotics is not the same as general purpose AI.Oh, what about movies like The Matrix and Terminator. Oh, you guys are now giving us Hollywood? If you believe in those weird movies, do you also believe in other dystopian movies like “I’m a legend”? In the latter movie, a germ gets out and wipes out most of humanity. Does it mean we have to close down the pharma and medicine industry?Hollywood can paint a dystopian picture from anything possible. They have even made something as harmless as vacuum cleaners into dangerous things. Should we stop doing all of them?In fact, anything useful can be made dangerous - think fire, water, air, cars, electricity, trains, medicines, petrol, sugar - any of them can kill you very easily.Anything that cannot kill you, is not of much use to you.Robotics, like any major revolution, can indeed cause chaos in the society. No different from agricultural revolution or industrial revolution. There will be displacement. People said the same for computing too. Could the people who were worried about computers doing spreadsheets in 1970s have thought about the whole new industries created by computing 40 years later?But, there are a whole set of important things that are not effectively today and we need robots there. Let me give you some examples of these:It need not always be life threatening. You walk into most stores now, and it hard to find anyone to assist you. The robots could walk with you, understand your requirements, help you shop and get things on your vehicle. It could play football with your children and take them off TV.I could give you 100s of such examples and that is the future. But, to get there we have to have more simpler robots doing more mundane things. A baby has to go through the toddler stage before becoming an adult.40 years ago, your parents would not have imagined what you do with computers. They could not have thought of the kind of revolutionary applications that we take for granted.A new revolution is beckoning us.
