2,"If you mean a phyletic gradualism transition, where the entire population transforms to a new species, then over a trillion years.

The problem is that our population is very large — over 7 billion and still climbing. For the entire population to transform, a new trait has to become “fixed” — present inIn order to become fixed, a trait increases in frequency fromThe number of generations it takes for fixation is proportional to 2 times the number of individuals and to the selection coefficient (how much the trait is selected for). Right now, any selection coefficient is going to be very low. This means that the number of generations is going to be about the same number of generations it takes using genetic drift, which is 4N generations. N = the effective population size. With 7 billion people, N is about 3.5 billion (the rest are too young to mate and have offspring, or too old). 4N = 14 billion. So that means 14 billion generations. With a generation time of 25 years for people, that means 350 billion years. So, if there are just 3 new traits needed to be a new species, that is over 1 trillion years.For all intents and purposes, H. sapiens is in stasis.Most speciation happens in small, peripheral populations. (Through most of our evolutionary history, N equaled about 10,000) This is allopatric speciation. The small population faces a new environment and it can evolve in fewer generations, because there are fewer individuals.However, modern transportation means that there are very few isolated populations. People move and interbreed. This is called gene flow.Bottom line, unless something drastically changes — either some disaster to reduce the total population to a hundred thousand — or a disaster to fragment the various populations, remove most technology, and prevent gene flow, H. sapiens is not going to evolve to a new species before the sun goes to the red giant stage in 5 billion years from now.If the disaster reduces population and fragments the survivors in isolated, different environments, then we could see multiple new species of Homo.",366 followers,Brett Alder,1.1K,0,0,2018,https://www.quora.com/If-Homo-Sapiens-became-extinct-overnight-would-great-apes-eventually-evolve-into-Homo-sapiens-like-creatures-again
