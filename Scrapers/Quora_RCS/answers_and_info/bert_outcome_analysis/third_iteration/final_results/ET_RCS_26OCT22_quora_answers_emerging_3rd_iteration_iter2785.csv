We all should be focusing more on building harmonious connections in our personal lives as well as in our cities and communities and our countries.Divides between supporters of who will lead a country is already no foundation to stand upon and anything hence forth will topple and that is in any situation in life, family, friends and we see supporters all over the world voting for multiple parties. No one agrees on the direction of their country and we all pull our own way it’s natural.The world needs a sense of community that stretches to all it’s members and in that we will have a future with whatever technology we have now or will have but as long as we have each other we will be fine.Remember that most of our technology is based upon someone else posting something or sharing something.

One thing I would change is to send it back a few years before WWI as Wikipedia contains the human history also, so there would be potential to learn from this and maybe avoid both WWI and WWII. I calculate that technology per Moore’s Law of doubling every 2 years or so, which means technology progression is not linear but rather 2^n exponential. Then having the knowledge of today back in 1910 could mean the progress can move at (2^n)^n, until it has reached today’s technology, then it would proceed again at 2^n. So this simple approx calculation can predict how many years it would take for them to catch up. I calculate 100-year progress using Moore’s Law to be 10E+15, so (2^n)^n to get to the same 10E+15 is between 14 to 16 years to leap to today’s 2020 technology. Thus it can be assumed that in 1910 + 15 = 1925, they would have equal technology of today.For those replies that are bogged down in trying to calculate how long it would take to copy the information by either printing it or writing it down, keep in mind that this is linear thinking and again technology moves in exponential progression per Moore’s Law. You don’t need to copy everything from the 10GB in a linear fashion. You just need enough technology to see how you can duplicate the information contained within, i.e. invent a method to copy of the 10GB in digital format (of which that information is within the Wikipedia pages) and that can now replicate in doubling and then doubling that, which is the exponential progression of Moore’s Law.","33,142 followers",Susanna Viljanen,1.5K,10.7K,164.8M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-would-happen-if-all-of-the-current-intellectuals-advancing-technology-dropped-dead-or-disappeared

Heywood, London, 1962; Benjamon, New York, 1963. x + 364 pp. Illus. $ 12.50In the book it details the infancy of atomic physics from about the time when Ernest Rutherford smashes the ""plum pudding"" model of the atom with his famous gold foil experiment where he bounces an alpha particle off a gold nucleus with a low but predictable frequency, proving that the atom is mostly empty space. During this time Rutherford had a brilliant student, Henry Moseley, who set up a series of experiments on the newly discovered nuclei of a variety of elements and proved that the atomic number wasn't just a chemist's imagination but a real physical property of the nucleus. This led to the book recording Rutherford's famous quip that ""All science is either physics or stamp collecting"" - a dig a chemists who at that time were busily playing ""gotta catch 'em all"" with the elements but had not the physicist's bent to decompose the elements into their subatomic components and then make up mathematical models about what they would do.Now of course, this is all veryThe business of war in the modern age is all aboutBack to the story of Rutherford. When World War One broke out, his lab was pulled off atomic research. Nobody saw the point. He was immediately tasked with finding a way to detect submarines. Moseley resigned his position as a graduate research assistant and volunteered with the British Army. Rutherford begged him not to go, but Moseley was resolute. Moseley even prevented Rutherford from using his considerable influence to get Moseley a ""safe"" posting.Moseley would eventually deploy to Gallipoli, as an operator of the newly invented radio set, where he was killed by a sniper on the 10th of August 1915.Moseley was a brilliant man and a proven scientist. He could have done so much for his country and humanity as a whole. War denied us access to his skills, because Moseley was taken from us by a 2 cent bullet.It would be 30 years before the discoveries made at Manchester would inform the research at the Manhattan Project, culminating in the atomic bombing of Hiroshima on the 6th of August 1945. Crash courses in applied science with little regard to safety or human life can make spectacular advances in technology and make the impossible possible. But for Applied Science to exist, the humble work of Pure Science must first lead the way.","5,990 followers",Jens Böttiger,566,2.6K,17.6M,2015,https://www.quora.com/What-would-happen-if-all-of-the-current-intellectuals-advancing-technology-dropped-dead-or-disappeared

Germany’s production was in the wrong place, instead of pouring resources into indestructible Panzers and stealth bombers, they should have efficiently produced more Panthers and Panzer IVs. Though this wouldn’t help their manpower and oil shortages. Germany was dealt a bad hand and played it to the best of their ability. Germany quite honestly should have focused on Africa and secured the oil fields in the Middle East instead of invading Russia for their oil.","33,143 followers",Susanna Viljanen,568,10.7K,164.8M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-would-happen-if-all-of-the-current-intellectuals-advancing-technology-dropped-dead-or-disappeared

Togoland and Samoa became self-sufficient, turning out profits for the Empire on the whole. Qingdao, on the Chinese coast, became a model for Chinese cities to follow. It would take wonders to work the miracles that the Germans had pulled off in their colonies.German Southwest Africa had one of the most enlightened colonial governors in the World, Theodor Leutwein. He, contrary to the prevalent European and American opinion of the time, thought of African men as equals, and he would judge them on their merits. The Germans built cities and railroads in the new territory, but the Herero and Nama, who refused a change from their traditional way of living, and alienated by the German dispossession of their land, rebelled. This resulted in the Herero and Nama Genocide.Remember, the Herero and Nama genocide was not planned by the German government or their army, but by the Schutztruppe commander in GSWA, Lothar von Trotha, in response to the killing of German men and mutilation of German women and children.Even in the 1930s, the effect of the German economic and social reforms could be seen in the former German territories. The schools and hospitals built by the Germans were still being used, and the railways built extensively by the Germans helped in the development of these countries after their independence.So Africa would have grown under German rule.Imperial Germany had the most open laws with few racial prejudices. Jews, who were persecuted in Russia and France, were given full citizenship, and were treated as an equal group within German society.Germany was the science and technological center of the World. Many famous scientists were from Germany, including Fritz Haber, who invented a method to industrially manufacture Ammonia, which probably is the reason we are alive today. Ostwald, Bosch, Röntgen, Hertz and many other scientists were from Germany. Imperial Germany, in its 49 years of existence, won more Nobel Prizes than Britain, France, the USA and Russia combined.Germany did not have any desires of World domination, because they were already the dominant power in the world. The reason Brest-Litovsk was so harsh was because of Trotsky's policy of 'Neither War nor Peace', which prompted the Germans to launch Operation Faustschlag.Lastly, without German defeat, there would be:","29,922 followers",Tomaž Vargazon,1.1K,7.7K,249.7M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-would-happen-if-all-of-the-current-intellectuals-advancing-technology-dropped-dead-or-disappeared

Liberalization would also most likely occur gradually under Glorious Emperor Charles I.2. America turning Syndicalist, and it’s second Civil war. Syndicalism wouldn’t take off in a world dominated by monarchies. No one wants such a radical idea never tried before to take hold; especially one that threatens the ruling powers. Since Russia didn’t turn socialist (with the help of Germany, Bulgaria, Austro-Hungary, and the Ottomans), ‘communism’ wouldn’t have a foothold, and it’s unlikely Syndicalism would either. New England succeeding also doesn’t make much sense, neither does the Pacific States, as such succession movements would never be strong enough for revolution. The American South still got what it wanted. Blacks had fewer rights than whites, and the reconstruction program after the American Civil war helped a lot. America was still growing at an immense rate, and Germany winning that doesn’t really affect an America who doesn’t enter the war (pretext to German victory in the war) and doesn’t care of the politics in Europe.3. A Kurdish uprising in the Ottoman Empire is unlikely. The Ottomans in the 20th century WOULD reform, how so? Well, the Young Turks (Enver Pasha, Talaat Pasha, and Cemal Pasha) already put the Ottoman Empire through some very VERY impressive modernization and reform in the mere 6 years they ruled before World War I. They were building a modern airforce, kickstarted an automobile industry, reformed education (notably by expanding it to women), there were record harvests in the empire, trade was at a all time high, Germany was helping to modernize the army, the navy was being modernized and expanded with the purchase of two dreadnoughts, a far more centralized government was taking shape, there was a infrastructure boom, and a 100 million dollar loan from France (2.5 billion today) was to be spent on public lighting, electricity, intercity railroads, and roads.Such things would have eventually cured the sick man of Europe.If they won the war, they would get Kuwait, the Aegean Islands, Sinai, Cyprus, a revision of their 1878 treaty with Russia, the Dodecanese Islands, Egypt, and Sudan as client states; as well as the rest of the Caucasus, and later down the line, possibly the rest of the majority of the Arabian peninsula.You might be asking “But what about oil” The Ottomans will discover Oil faster than the Arabs did in our timeline. Till 1908 during the Young Turk Revolution, cars, and automobiles were banned from the Empire, due in part from electric tools being banned, and other regulations. Only the Sultan, and a few other officials, could have them. This ended after the Young Turk Revolution, in which all restrictions to on cars were finally lifted. Ottoman entrepreneurs went straight to work trying to build new marvels of technology. However, the roads weren't paved, gas stations, and garages didn’t exist for the most part, no highway code, and arguments on which side should Ottomans drive. In 1913 there were 1 million automobiles in America, and in the Ottoman Empire, only 500, and 250 in Istanbul. Regardless, the Ottomans had only introduced cars 6 years before the war.If the Ottomans won, they would take control of the British oil fields of Kuwait; with the money received from winning the war, the Ottomans would have the capital to invest in building those roads, and exploit that oil. Since the demand for cars in the empire would be extremely high, their internal need for oil would also grow. The Ottomans before that though would have a huge excess of oil in Kuwait; Persia; and since they reversed the 1878 treaty (thus taking land in the Caucasus) they would have Caucasian oil as well. Once they discovered the Oil within their borders, the Ottomans would grow to become the Second most powerful economy in the world, behind Germany, and with all that money would come the Restoration of the Ottoman Empire.Berlin, Sofia, Vienna, and Constantinople would become some of the richest cities on earth, even more grand than the Dubai of today.Though that is just my opinion.",UNKNOWN,Titus,890,453,1.3M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-would-happen-if-all-of-the-current-intellectuals-advancing-technology-dropped-dead-or-disappeared

Stalin would die an angry but broken man. The German army would keep the peace. The Ukraine would become Germany's breadbasket and a place for German settlement - a new Prussia. There would be no famine. The Austrian Hungarian empire would become a federation of independent states thus curtailing Balkan nationalism. Adolf Hitler would die of old age crippled by too many bar fights. Europe had been at peace for most of the 19th century and this would continue and any disagreements would be settled by a new Congress of Berlin where the British would have observer status. Local conflicts would continue but even the rise of Japanese nationalism would be contained by access to natural resources and territory in China. China would continue to be a place of war lord infighting but without Communism.Many of the technological advances made after World War One would slow down considerably and the changes that occured after 1939 may take decades to appear. German physics would lead to splitting the atom for peaceful purposes shared with the United States and Britain.
