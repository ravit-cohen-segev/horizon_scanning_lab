2,"Yes, but you do not need a “Matrix” to do so, you just need to be able to exploit a crisis, which hasn’t happened since 1929 but will happen soon.Appealing to popular desires and prejudices of the more active population, which is usually more nationalistic and racial than the older, less active generations, who are more about economics.You need both economic crisis and ethnic friction in a country such as Germany or USA to install a totalitarian state.",1 follower,Xitong Zou,6.1K,3K,11.9M,2017,https://www.quora.com/Is-totalitarianism-possible-in-modern-developed-country-based-on-its-advanced-technology-like-Matrix-in-real-world

4,"No.Online you might find many Chinese brag about this:And thisThen they exclaim, that there are more skyscrapers, high speed trains, etc. in China than America, so they are developed.This is not the right definition of ‘developed’You don’t measure a city or country by outer appearance alone. The thing is we have to take a look at the innards of a country to really know whether or not you are truly developed. That Chinese are so obsessed with portraying the facade that they are technologically advanced and ahead is actually an indication that they have not fully developed yet. Because fully devNo.Online you might find many Chinese brag about this:And thisThen they exclaim, that there are more skyscrapers, high speed trains, etc. in China than America, so they are developed.This is not the right definition of ‘developed’You don’t measure a city or country by outer appearance alone. The thing is we have to take a look at the innards of a country to really know whether or not you are truly developed. That Chinese are so obsessed with portraying the facade that they are technologically advanced and ahead is actually an indication that they have not fully developed yet. Because fully developed countries have no need to show off things like that. Everyone knows they are developed.For example, here is San Francisco:Look, not many skyscrapers right? And look at those old cable cars going around! That must mean they are undeveloped right? Nope. Everyone knows San Francisco is a developed city. That’s why it has no need to show off with luxury skyscrapers and such things.Or how about Florence, Italy?Again, no skyscrapers here. But everyone knows it’s a developed city and Italy is a developed country.My point is, you have got to look at the people and the innards of a country to truly know if they are developed.This is the true face of China:You have got to look at the average person. Does the average Chinese have good access to healthcare (which is ranked near the bottom in WHO rankings btw)? Can they drink tap water safely? Do they have access to quality food? Do all have access to electricity or paved roads or a quality education? The answer is: probably, yes, if you are living in the rich east coast provinces of Jiangsu or Zhejiang or Guangdong- but not if you are living in say - Xinjiang or Gansu or Tibet. China’s wealth is not spread equally, neither is it developed equally. Even though the CCP has developed China quite fast - there is still a lot of work to be done making sure *every Chinese* have equal access to everything.And then you got to look at the attitude of the people. When I was in China I found that you really got to look out for who you trust, because there is a lot of scams going on all the time. You never know what is real, what is fake, what is real price of anything. Why do these scams exist? Because people have to be desperate to make money that’s why.Why are people desperate to make money? Probably because they are not making enough to survive, which is an indication that the country is still developing. You’ll notice that in general, the more developed a country is, the less likely there will be scams. In Korea/Japan/Taiwan, you will not find very many scams. In China and Eastern Europe it’s likely.Another aside I want to note is that Chinese bathrooms don’t contain any toilet paper. Do you know the reason why? It’s because people steal it. Now, in what developed country does this happen? I can’t think of any. Only in a developing country would you need to bring your own toilet paper to the bathroom because there isn’t any there due to fear of people stealing it.I find GDP/capita to be generally a pretty good indicator of how developed a country is. The average GDP/capita (PPP) of China is still around $8k/person. While that is higher than most Asian countries - it’s still below the 4 East Asian tigers + Japan and far from the $62k/person that the USA has.The true measure of a developed society is to observe the people that live in the country and not the appearance of the country itself. Chinese “face” culture is the same. You can just obviously see that China has developed really really fast, and mentality wise people are still harping about luxury products and consumerism - this is where Americans were back in the 50s, 60s and 70s, not now.The biggest consumers of luxury products are Chinese people, not Americans or Europeans. The more developed you are, the less need you have to validate your self worth with materialism. The less desire you have to spend thousands of dollars on your children's schooling just to send them to be educated abroad. The less need to travel to countries like Canada or USA for giving birth so that your child becomes a US or Canadian citizen, or to launder your money by buying up real estate in other countries. Developed countries do not need to do things like that.Thats why you should always pay attention to the old adage -Edit:Of course, Chinese commenters love to bring up the USA. Yes, USA has lots of impoverished areas too; every country has developed areas and undeveloped areas, however my point is that for China there is significantly more undeveloped areas at a higher % compared to the USA. The poverty rate for China is 16% as of 2019 and for USA it is 1.5% as of 2019.

7,"The crew had chosen to turn off the main reporting system. Unbeknownst to them there was a secondary system in the engines, but the airline had chosen not to pay for continuous monitoring, so it was just sending an empty report every half hour. Nevertheless it was this secondary system that told them it had turned south.Even new technology costs money, and new equipment to aviation standards and the regulations to manage them cost a lot of money. The aviation industry is very conservative. And it is very hard to defend against malice from the crew.","4,964 followers",Kåre Lohse,963,864,3.2M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Is-totalitarianism-possible-in-modern-developed-country-based-on-its-advanced-technology-like-Matrix-in-real-world
8,"Basically we have two types of surveillance (tracking):Active surveillance or passive surveillance. The difference is that active surveillance (such as for instance primary radar) does not require any cooperation (help) from the target (e.g. an aircraft). Whereas the passive surveillance requires cooperation (actions) by the tracked aircraft to be seen and then be tracked (followed). A good example is ADS-B, space based ADS-B or ADS-C, where the aircraft is tracked (by broadcasted) GPS position reports or where the position is reported to a ground station at regular intervals.

A good example is ADS-B, space based ADS-B or ADS-C, where the aircraft is tracked (by broadcasted) GPS position reports or where the position is reported to a ground station at regular intervals. Many long range flights make regular technical reports to their homebase using SATCOM, where the GPS position is embedded (see AF441 Rio - Paris).If the aircraft does not want to be tracked it can switch off the tracking and position systems and so disappear, even today with all the additional measures that were implemented recently. The major drawback of active surveillance is the range that is very limited (basically the line of sight). This means that active surveillance is not available in remote and in oceanic areas (I guess that today only roughly 20 % of our earth is currently covered by active (independant) surveillance). As long as a crew (and the occupants) of a flight have the means (technically speaking) to disable position reporting (tracking) a second MH370 disappearance cannot be totally excluded….",15 followers,Joe Shelton,763,9.7K,48.1M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Is-totalitarianism-possible-in-modern-developed-country-based-on-its-advanced-technology-like-Matrix-in-real-world
9,"Despite ‘high technology’, sending radio signal over oceans still is not an easy business. People think satellites, which is clever, but not always right. It’s easy to send signals DOWN from a satellite, but hard, very hard, to send them up from the earth-the satellite is a small, and moving target.It takes large, parabolic shaped antennas that can track the satellites to send signals to them. Hard to do on a moving ship, very, very hard (and expensive) to do on an aircraft.","1,124 followers",Shane Kai Glenn,1.4K,547,1.8M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Is-totalitarianism-possible-in-modern-developed-country-based-on-its-advanced-technology-like-Matrix-in-real-world
