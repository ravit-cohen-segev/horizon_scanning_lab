The experience of last decade have shown HOW entrepreneurs can bootstrap, the difficult question is WHY? followed by WHO to pull into your vision (think Raman noodle funding) and WHAT tends to be segment specific. My suggestion is if you don’t have much of a clue, focus on foundational entrepreneurial competency (below).As for sectors, look to the developing world which is aiming to leapfrog a lot of the OECD sunk infrastructure and growing middle-class populations. The potential spacesTechnology cycles comes in several stages so figure out which one you are good at, the basic engineering Research (internet was build on DARPA funding in 70s/80s), Recognition by niche communities (BBB, W3C) then broader press, then massive Replication (Netscape release of Mosaic cascading into dot.con boom/bust in late 90s) before Repurposing (becoming foundational tech for next cycle, in this case cloud … read the book “The Big Switch”). This then gave rise following decades to the attention economy, social economy and now sharing economy. Being the lead runner in one cycle doesn’t guarantee survival in the next (IBM-MS-Yahoo, etc). History shows that on average, about 1–2 unicorn (billion dollar valuation) companies emerge annually so calculate your chances to come out top of the next.","246,826 followers",Dushka Zapata,2.9K,8.5K,232.3M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-technologies-that-will-usher-in-the-next-mega-trends-in-startups-in-a-few-years-What-will-we-be-talking-about-in-5-years

The things we were doing started with the Velleman kits that you could build yourself and went up to the £1,000 things that would just plug ’n’ go (well, you had to install drivers and software).People thought it was going to be like Star Trek replicators. Then they discovered how hard it is to do 3d modelling on a computer, especially when the shapes are organic rather than mechanical.Because in reality 3d modelling is the modern-day counterpart of the old pattern-maker’s job. Pattern-makers used to be the most highly-skilled people in the foundry because they worked in all sorts of materials to make the original patterns for casts. It wasn’t easy.Did you know that you can’t have right angles when you’re casting or injecting plastics? If you do, you end up getting a different cooling rate and the cast or injection will come out wonky at the edges and it might even fracture very easily. You have to introduce radii. You didn’t? Neither did a lot of people doing additive on their new machines, either. Neither did they appreciate that delicate bits might need a support in the manufacturing process that you’d have to fettle off afterwards. And certainly they didn’t take into account the properties of ABS and PLA. Saw some grand fails because of that.And that’s before we actually get to the software. have you ever done any 3d modelling? Bugger me, it’s hard when you’re doing mechanical things. If you want to create something like this:you get yourself on an art course for the next three or four years because look at all those bastard polygons you’ve got to mush about to get the form. And I bet those back feet needed some support that needed fettling off, too.And that was the problem. People saw experts, who’d spent ages getting good at this, knocking stuff out and making it look easy. Because for them it was. And so they bought these machines and the software and as soon as that software opened they were faced with things like primitives, compounds, tapers, free-form deformations, parametric deformations, polygons, vertices, XYZ axes and all the rest of it and they hadn’t got a bloody clue how to do any of it. And precious little layman’s resource available to help them; most online tutorials assumed you knew the basics of CAM and CAD and started at too high a level for beginners.And so people shied away from it because it’s bloody hard. You need perseverance, patience, and above all a lot of time to get any good at it. Most people were lacking in at least one. Some in all three.I blame the EU.

All of the services in the supply and distribution chain follow these regional fabricators.There are two sides to the 3D printing industry: industrial and consumer. The consumer side is almost entirely small businesses. The problem is that there are far too many of them. Some of them will not survive, but some of the ones that do will drive the improvement of consumer-grade machines. The technology and capabilities of consumer machines and industrial machines will start to merge over time, which will present opportunities for the small businesses on the consumer side. On the industrial side, many of the companies are small to medium size. There is likely to be business consolidation on the industrial side, and maybe some failures. Also, improvements in 3D printing technology will drive the creation of many new kinds of businesses.","3,411 followers",Louis Vaught,708,1.2K,13.5M,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-technologies-that-will-usher-in-the-next-mega-trends-in-startups-in-a-few-years-What-will-we-be-talking-about-in-5-years

Hell yeah, there are already few alumni graduated from our college working in these companies.IT giants like Google, Facebook don’t discriminate on the basis of your college for hiring, they have a mark set up for their employees, if you match or cross their mark, you will surely be hired by them.I received the above mail from Google almost an year back, one of the best mail I ever got. In my telephonic round they asked a question based on trie, I wasn’t acquainted of tries back then and couldn’t clear the round but the Interview was one hell of an experience and motivated me to code more. Right now I have offer from Honeywell and currently interning at GeeksforGeeks as a technical content writer but Google dreams are still on, I still code everyday and improve daily.The point of all this being that your alma matter plays only a small amount of role if you dream of IT giants like Google and Facebook, if you have good knowledge of data structures and algorithms and are passionate about computer science in general then don’t bother about the college, MIT Manipal has a good reputation in general amongst IT companies and you will be given equal opportunity and consideration provided you are good enough for them. There are lot of openings which keep popping up in these companies, feel free to apply to these positions through portals like Google careers, etc., participate in competitions like Google Code Jam, Facebook Hacker Cup, ICPC, etc., contribute to various open source projects through GSOC, etc. and rest sky is the limit.Talking of MIT Manipal as a college it’s an amazing college where you would never fall short of opportunities, this place is full of GSOCers, ICPC qualifiers and other tech savy enthusiasts who do a brilliant job in their respective fields and create a name for themselves in the tech world. To be more precise you could end up in companies like Google and Facebook through your graduation from MIT Manipal by applying off campus and you would find decent resources here to accomplish your goal, it’s to you how you use them and optimize your time.In the end I would like to conclude by saying that “Keep your head straight, do your work and the rest will follow”.",65 followers,Pawan Dubey,1K,0,0,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-technologies-that-will-usher-in-the-next-mega-trends-in-startups-in-a-few-years-What-will-we-be-talking-about-in-5-years

If the pitch works and we bite, a technology can quickly transform our social norms.Photo: Lincoln AgnewInside the New Industrial RevolutionA closer look at the profound implications of the mobile internet, automation and AI.At the WSJ Tech D.Live conference in Laguna Beach, Calif., this week, what became apparent across dozens of talks, classes and informal chats is that, when almost anything we can dream up is possible, the most important factors in the spread of technology are now cultural. Not every new development in technology leads to an Uber-scale industry, of course, but here are five trends that highlight this shift.China’s success in addressing tech needs at home has made it a global leader.Patrick Collison, chief executive of Stripe, talked about how much of Asia is leapfrogging the West because there isn’t tons of old infrastructure—like gas-guzzling car fleets—to update, so the latest technology catches on right away. In China, this is especially true in payments, which are now overwhelmingly made through mobile phones. The world’s leading face-recognition and drone companies are in China, and its electric-vehicle, autonomous-driving and AI companies are already on par with their U.S. counterparts, said Kai-Fu Lee, former president of Google China and current head of technology-investment firm Sinovation Ventures.China’s mission rests on techies dedicated to building the future for its billion-plus population—achieving global technological dominance en route.Uber operates in more than 70 countries. An Uber driver in Buenos Aires. Photo: Marcos Brindicci/ReutersUber isn’t yet profitable—but it’s already successfully changed us.We no longer get to call Uber “just a taxi company” because it’s also altering our use of personal vehicles, mass transit and food delivery. The Uber Eats food-delivery experiment is expected to do $6 billion in food sales annually (shared with its restaurant partners), Mr. Khosrowshahi said.However, in anticipation of its 2019 IPO, Uber already releases financial information, so we know how much its success costs: UberUber has always been a bet on our changing habits as much as the power of new technologies. For the company to live up to its lofty valuation, many more of us are going to have to buy the company’s thesis that we should ditch our cars entirely and just take Uber instead.Sweeping regulations are coming for tech companies.Tech companies are guardedly in favor; they’d rather have uniform federal regulation than some patchwork of state rules. At the conference, AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson reiterated his support for basic provisions of net neutrality; his words harked back to his January letter to Congress pushing for an “internet bill of rights.” Mr. Khosrowshahi said Uber is working with regulators already.California has already passed data-privacy protections, and Europe’s GDPR may be a model as well. That means a future with way more pop-ups on every site you use, but also possibly the ability to see all the data companies collect on you, and to correct or delete it. This is all driven by our collective realization that these “free” services come with a privacy cost.A number of flying-car prototypes already exist, including the Kitty Hawk. Photo: Anthony Blasko for The Wall Street JournalWe wanted flying cars…and now we’re going to get flying cars.At the WSJ Tech conference, Rodin Lyasoff, head of Airbus’s Silicon Valley innovation lab, pointed out that a number of flying-car prototypes already exist, including the Kitty Hawk flying car (which the Journal has reviewed) and his company’s Vahana experimental aircraft.What makes flying cars distinct from today’s helicopters is that they are smaller and lighter, all electric, and are eventually meant to be fully autonomous. Hobbyists and thrill seekers could be flying them tomorrow except for one very important cultural barrier: Nobody wants flight-safety statistics, which are currently fantastic, to worsen. This means all aircraft that will be used for commercial services must continue to go through FAA certification. Even under the best of circumstances, Mr. Lyasoff said it would take a couple of years and a billion dollars to convert one of these prototypes into a flying car that a company could sell.CEO of A3 by Airbus Rodin Lyasoff discussed how he envisions the future of autonomous flight and how flying cars will impact airspace. Lyasoff spoke at the WSJ D. Live tech conference in Laguna Beach, Calif.Commercial flying-car services are coming—the question is, will it be in two years or 20? It all depends on when we view flying-car tech as safe enough for widespread adoption.In the future, the top jobs are robot engineer and elder caregiver.While it will certainly take more than five years for the workforce of the future to take shape, it will require a lot of engineers and technicians, mainly for R&D.But while some people will help automation along, others will resist it. Jobs requiring warmth and compassion will likely still be filled by humans, because the people being cared for don’t want robots in that role. Chief among these occupations will be looking after the world’s elderly.Not incidentally, Mr. Lee believes that journalism will be among the fields that will be largely automated, so readers should enjoy this column while it lasts.Originally Published on",0 followers,Lucas Martin,6.4K,65,4.2M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-technologies-that-will-usher-in-the-next-mega-trends-in-startups-in-a-few-years-What-will-we-be-talking-about-in-5-years

AI could turn out be this gigantic success, that could transform us forever—or just end up as an over-hype, destined to lie in the wastebasket, along with hundreds of other failed ideas.But let’s think about it.There isn’t much else we’rePerhaps this is the key, that’ll lead to the next thing. Let’s face it, we’ve gotten so advanced, we couldn’t keep things running without the help of computers.SoOut of this, there is only one thing which we can all agree on, which is—we can never tell what the future holds for us.ARMAAN AGRAWAL","58,987 followers",Michael Wolfe,504,2K,17.3M,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-technologies-that-will-usher-in-the-next-mega-trends-in-startups-in-a-few-years-What-will-we-be-talking-about-in-5-years

The difference is one wakes up in the year 2018 and the other wakes up in 1818.The latter wakes up chilly, to the sound of a rooster crowing, from a bed of straw he shares with lots of bedbugs. Neither his night shirt nor his bedding is terribly clean, and he splashes water on his face from a bowl to help wake up before looking outside to try to guess what the weather will be like today. He, like all of his family and most people he knows, is a farmer, so the weather matters a lot to him, and any other news will be a long time coming, including that his brother, who lives just a couple towns away, broke his leg a few days back and passed away from an infection. He works from sun up to sundown because he has little machinery and he would probably work longer if he had access to something better than candles to provide light.Our other man wakes up in 2018 to the sound of an alarm clock, he is not hot or cold because his home has central heating. His pajamas and bedding are quite clean because he has a washer and dryer. He is a bit groggy because he can light his home at the flick of a switch so often stays up later than he should. Fortunately he has hot coffee and a hot shower to help him wake up, and he checks his email while drinking that coffee and listening to the news and weather. He already knows his brother broke his leg a few days back, even though he lives a long distance away, and of course he does not die from an infection, he’s just at home bored and probably would welcome a phone call.These are two very different lives. They are separated by three centuries, a dozen generations, and a slew of inventions both major and minor. Those inventions, major and minor, have altered our civilization profoundly during that time. My answer however is not those inventions, but rather the ones emerging nowadays that will change our lives once more, many of which get little notice in the news.Even those emerging technologies that get reported with much pomp and hype often bypass a lot of the simple yet drastic changes they will bring to how we go about our normal day. A survey of technologies that don’t get talked about a lot, but will change the world we live in, requires introducing those technologies and explaining the potential of each. The trick is that technologies that don’t get a lot of fanfare don’t get it because their value and applications are not too obvious. Fundamentally, technology is about making our lives better, safer, and more convenient. To talk about the impact technology will have on our lives we need to go deeper than just what the technology does, like how a fusion reactor makes electricity cheaper and renewable, an obvious benefit, but also how it alters our day to day life. Cheaper electricity is awesome, an energy source that doesn’t run out or cause environmental problems is awesome, but it is easy to overlook all the other benefits that come along with them.We need to cover several such technologies. So to do this we will walk through a day in the life of two people, Sam, who lives nowadays in the year 2018, and Hannah, who lives just a few generations from now inOkay,What’s interesting about Sam and Hannah’s lives is that they both live in a pretty automated and high tech civilization.We spend a lot of time on this answer talking about futures in Hannah’s Era or even centuries further ahead, and we tend to focus on big things. New spaceships, new energy sources, giant constructs we could build around our own star or other stars and the ships that will get you there. Not today though, for today it does not matter that Ted was actually playing golf in a rotating habitat orbiting the Earth, complaining about how the spin throws off his normal swing. We care that his golf partner was actually lying down at home on his bed playing with him in virtual reality, and that he, Ted, and Hannah were thousands of kilometers apart, but all felt like they were in the same environment chatting, even though they were not in the same place and quite possibly all saw different environments. We don’t care that they have rocket ships with big fusion powered drives that can get to Mars in a week, we care about them having cars they can sleep in, fully relaxed in the knowledge that it could drive through a blizzard without a risk of accident and that if one did somehow happen, a dozen safety systems would pop on deploying airbags and restraints before the vehicle even hit the target, and that if somehow even that wasn’t enough, an automated ambulance would be on the scene in moments with robots controlled by experts hundreds of kilometers away piloting them, and already knowing from the vehicle monitors exactly what happened and where all the injuries were and how severe. We also don’t particularly care that Hannah’s son can do classes online, we already have ever-improving technology allowing that. We care about the automated interactive aspects of that, something called Affective Computing, or computers and systems that can recognize, interpret, process, or simulate human body language and affects. Fundamentally it is this sort of technology that holds the strongest potential to revolutionize our lives.Sure, a student can watch a recorded lecture and pick from several variations of it by other people covering that same topic, just as you can do now on YouTube for instance. But it is aThe Uncanny Valley, our tendency to respond more negatively to things which seem closer to human than further away, is a big hurdle to making such simulations, but if you can get past it, you open the door for books that don’t just get read aloud by some cold disjointed voice, but can be real-time performed like a TV show or interactive virtual environment without needing actors. It’s a lot easier to learn the history of the world when instead of a book or lecture or even historical TV drama, a person can land in that environment where the bits they find boring can be seamlessly detected and altered, so they remain focused on the important knowledge while enjoying themselves. It’s nice to have a test that doesn’t need to have questions checking your reading comprehension, because it already knows what that was from monitoring you while you read, and even nicer if most text can adapt as you’re reading it to rephrase the information or the question to better communicate to you as an individual. It’s like the automatic translator that doesn’t just hear what someone said in another language and translate it word for word, but instead can convert all the idioms and expressions into another language and its own idioms and expressions. It will be even cooler if one day we can just download knowledge and skills into your head, like in the film theWe didn’t focus on cool new power production methods like fusion today, we focused on ways to conveniently get power. Wireless energy transmission by magnetic induction or energy beaming, smaller and better batteries and solar panels, or harvesting energy right from the person. Leaching just a little energy away from every motion, maybe even putting devices in the body that could steal a bit of energy from your own food to transmit it to devices in or on you. IPredicting the future of technology is always a hit and miss game, often in hindsight the stuff is obvious, but can’t be predicted in advance. Some technology and its impact is easy enough to predict, but what makes them inaccurate in most cases is all those tiny secondary advantages and changes and those tend to focus on human desire and convenience. It’s not that hard to predict faster computers, the internet, satellites, or cell phones. What’s hard to predict is people using those to post a picture of what they ate for lunch. Once you do, you can imagine that a lot of restaurants will advertise online and show photos of the menu. It will seem obvious in hindsight that someone is going to make a piece of software that can look at that image and make some smart guesses about its nutritional value and calorie count. It will seem obvious in hindsight that as we get more Affective Computing able to monitor your reactions, your computer will get better at showing you bits of stuff on your social media newsfeed that you’ll enjoy, and that advertisers will be able to hit you with an ad showing a picture of pizza with the toppings you like when you are just getting a little hungry and haven’t had pizza recently, and tomorrow you’ll get shown sandwiches instead. It’s predictable that 3D printers, and fast, cheap, delivery might put a dent in classic retail shopping. It’s predictable that automated vehicles, not needing expensive drivers, will make it much cheaper to deliver things or take a taxi, so that fewer people might own individual vehicles.It’sHowever, it is very easy for us miss a lot of those secondary applications that can quietly sneak in there to revolutionize our lives just as much as landing on the Moon did, or going to Mars will.Have a great day (10 april 2018) !",0 followers,Glen Boston,655,71,1.7M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-technologies-that-will-usher-in-the-next-mega-trends-in-startups-in-a-few-years-What-will-we-be-talking-about-in-5-years
