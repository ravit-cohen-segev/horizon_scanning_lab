0,"Not really, no, unless you can figure out a way to cool them. Apparently it’s very difficult to cool down electronics in space, due to vacuum being an excellent insulator.Besides, why bother with the nuclear power, when solar works so well up there… and how would you even get reactors and stuff in orbit, when the rockets that have to carry them can potentially blow up and shower everybody with radioactive waste…","105,674 followers",Dave Consiglio,4.5K,6.8K,91.6M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Would-it-be-beneficial-to-build-massive-nuclear-powered-super-computers-in-space

2,We can do that now on the Earth.Make them solar powered and orbit them closer to the sun.But we can make the biggest computers that we can use and afford now.

6,"No, and it would be impractical and uneconomical. First, although space is cold it may not be cold enough in near earth orbit. Second, building in empty space will leave the builder and components exposed to cosmic rays from all directions. Third, it would cost too much to send equipment up out to space only to have to bring them back down to earth attempting to maintain the low temperature. So it would not be beneficial at all when such issues can be avoided while building quantum computers on earth under the proper conditions and adequate temperatures.","29,975 followers",Tomaž Vargazon,974,7.7K,249.9M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Would-it-be-beneficial-to-build-massive-nuclear-powered-super-computers-in-space

9,"Because the United States does not allow China to use the International Space Station (which the United States is leading the effort to build)So China has to build a space station of its own.Recently, Shenzhou XII was successfully launched and Chinese astronauts Nie Haisheng, Liu Booming and Tang Hongbo have been stationed on the space station belonging to China itself, where they will carry out a three-month space mission.The previous record holders were Jing Haipeng and Chen Dong, who flew on Shenzhou 11 five years ago and spent 32 days in the Tiangong-2 and Shenzhou-11 cBecause the United States does not allow China to use the International Space Station (which the United States is leading the effort to build)So China has to build a space station of its own.Recently, Shenzhou XII was successfully launched and Chinese astronauts Nie Haisheng, Liu Booming and Tang Hongbo have been stationed on the space station belonging to China itself, where they will carry out a three-month space mission.The previous record holders were Jing Haipeng and Chen Dong, who flew on Shenzhou 11 five years ago and spent 32 days in the Tiangong-2 and Shenzhou-11 combinations.After the construction of the future space station is completed, the Chinese Tiangong space station will be open to the world, accepting applications from countries around the world to be stationed on the Chinese space station.Although the original ISS was called ""International"", only countries that had invested money or technology in the construction of the ISS were eligible to send astronauts on board. Moreover, the time spent on the ISS by astronauts from each country is allocated according to the amount of money or resources invested by their country. As of January 2018, a total of 230 astronauts from 18 countries have visited the ISS, with astronauts from the United States and Russia making up the majority, 145 and 46 respectively.This is not the case with the Chinese space station, where China is willing to offer all countries the opportunity to use the Chinese space station, sending a very positive signal in terms of promoting space exploration and cooperation that will give many countries that do not have access to space the opportunity to do so.A total of 27 countries have applied to be on the Chinese Tiangong space station, and China has agreed to cooperate with 16 countries, including Switzerland, Poland, Germany, Italy, Norway, France, Spain, the Netherlands, India, Russia, Belgium, Kenya, Japan, Saudi Arabia, Mexico and Peru. Among them, the European Space Agency has already sent astronauts to China to train with Chinese astronauts. Matthias Maurer, an astronaut from the European Space Agency who participated in the training, had even before this started to actively learn Chinese in preparation for entering the Chinese Tiangong space station, and it is safe to say that in the near future we could see images of Chinese and foreign astronauts jointly participating in flights.",UNKNOWN,Robert Frost,901,9.4K,195.6M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Would-it-be-beneficial-to-build-massive-nuclear-powered-super-computers-in-space

13,"If you are serious about anyone being able to detect our satellites from other galaxies then the chance is nil.

The radiation from Sputnik and satellites launched since then will have travelled in a sphere with a maximum radius of approximately 64 light years. So any civilisation within that bubble sayv couple hundred stars,with the right detectors could in theory detect us.However thanks to the inverse square law ,whereby the energy of radiation diminishes by the square of its distance, they would need detectors about the size of their solar systems to detect us . And then some pretty awesome computer power to filter out the radiation from our own sun and other sources like planets.All this to tune into I love Lucy?

14,"By spotting Earth, I assume that you mean “detect” Earth, as in detect our radio signals. We have been sending satellites into orbit for about 3/4 of a century, and we have been broadcasting radio waves into the atmosphere since November 1920, almost 101 years ago.. It is assumed that broadcast signals into our atmosphere carry into space as well, albeit at a much weaker strength than received here on Earth. Based upon those facts and assumptions, any alien civilization capable of receiving and interpreting our signals, within 101 light years of Earth may be able to detect our signals.
