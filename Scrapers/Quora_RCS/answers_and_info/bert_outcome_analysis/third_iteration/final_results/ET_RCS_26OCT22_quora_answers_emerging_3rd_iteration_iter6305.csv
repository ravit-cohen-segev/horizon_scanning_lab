That’s the opposite of lactose intolerance. About a third of the global population retains the ability to digest lactose through adulthood as opposed to having it cut off at the end of infancy. Some thousand years ago, that gene appeared as a mutation, likely somewhere in western Asia. It propagated because it provided an evolutionary advantage. People with the gene could digest milk and a range of milk products.However, that was only advantageous because milk was available, which was in turn a consequence of the domestication of animals and the so-called secondary products revolution, which is to say the development of uses for animals which don’t involve killing them, like using cattle for milk, sheep for wool, and chickens for feathers and eggs. Up until a few thousand years ago, such a gene would have been useless. You need a supply of milk for that capability to become at all meaningful, and to get a supply of milk, you need domesticated animals who will sit still for being milked. Wild animals don’t do that, and hunter-gatherers had no access to milk. It was, therefore, a technological development—the rise of domesticated animals—which set up conditions for a new mutation to propagate through a large population.",3 followers,Samuel Bateman,1.1K,102,56.2K,UNKNOWN,https://www.quora.com/Are-Humans-evolving-in-conjunction-with-Technological-advances-how-so

Such reality altering discoveries and advancements are found to take place at a time when we are both prepared and during our most signficant in nature worldwide need for such advancement. Leading to this observation:“Only when humanity is capable of handling the advancement and a need for such advancement is necessary does the said discovery become realized.”We have in the past few month's made several significant strides.In April we saw Brookhaven National Laboratory make progress by enlisting the assistance of Fermilab to further discern the magnetic moment of the muon, which if realized will uproot the basic mathematical tenants of Quantum Physics, show there to be an imperfection in Dirac's (Beautiful) Equation and shed a shadow of on Einstein's General Theory of Relativity.These occursnces are likely dependent on the coming measurement results soon to take place in Tokai Japan at the J-PARC Center either confirming or denying the existence of a significant enough magnetic moment deviation as required by the newly formed g-2 Initiative.On May 7th 2021 the bypassing of the Uncertainty Principle was announced by both NIST and the Aalto University of Finland. A monumental accomplishment by these two independent sources because it is now possible to do what was deemed by the majority of scientist to be impossible… know precisely and simultaneously both the position and momentum of particles.In July Brookhaven Laboratory reached another milestone while attempting to research the Breit-Wheeler Theory by using gold ions to intersect light and for the first time - created from light what were once ‘non-existent electrons'.Last by not least the discovery of the time crystal and it's effect on the always perceived to forever be the nature of reality - the Second Law of Thermodynamics.There are several reasons relating to the answering of the question: ‘Why now?’.One of the main answers is the old school academia and promoters of the idea that any violation of the Uncertainty Principle, the Second Law of Thermodynamics or any of the aforementioned areas was to be considered scientfic blasphemy as contemptuous and further viewed as an attempt to evaluate, what their conception of reality deemed ‘pseudoscience' and was by virtue of this pre-determination ‘not allowed as possible'.Many of the individuals who held these beliefs or were in the positions of authority to determined the demarcation of science to pseudoscience are no longer with us, retired, no longer are in a position where their voices make a difference, are just too tired to argue or now realize due to such discoveries as are now taking place… they were wrong the entire time.This in itself is a guide as to what is happening and why it is at this point in time that these discoveries are taking place.Humanity is in the midst of an ideological upheaval and with it our ideological impairments of the past are being unveiled.This is happening quickly now and as our minds are focused elsewhere, these changes are taking place - doing so without much fanfare. A long haired blonde guy Duane on Quora causes us to go to a search engine where we are then shockingly surprised.Along with these changes will come results we never saw coming and within these results, if we are wise enough to preceive it, will lie the means of transforming, in a positive way… many of our most pressing current predicaments.","220,613 followers",Franklin Veaux,1.8K,47.3K,782.9M,UNKNOWN,https://www.quora.com/Are-Humans-evolving-in-conjunction-with-Technological-advances-how-so

Scientific developments have controlled that for the time being but one only has to imagine what would happen if a variant evolves that results in certain death if one is exposed to it. Perhaps a few primitive humans somewhere, perhaps on remote islands might survive if the virus died out (ie no more hosts) before reaching them. Future humanity would then evolve from them without technology having played any part in their existence.Sudden severe climate change that human bodies cannot tolerate could cause sudden extinction that technology could not prevent and that would affect all humans irrespective of location. A major volcanic eruption (Yellowstone) might create dust that blocked all sunlight and hence food production etc.Of course technology like nuclear bombs could result in humans making themselves go extinct very quickly whereas the application of nuclear energy to replace fossil fuels in the short term might control human induced climate change and prevent extinction.

With this understanding, you’d then point to our modern longevity and note that “humans have largely solved the problem of survivability” — which we have.

And what is it looking for? You might say, “survival of the fittest” or “natural selection”. And that’s where a lot of the confusion comes from.
