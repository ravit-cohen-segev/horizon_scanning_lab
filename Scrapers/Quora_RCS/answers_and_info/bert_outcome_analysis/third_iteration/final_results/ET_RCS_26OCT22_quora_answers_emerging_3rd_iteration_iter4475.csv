There are conventional weapons that designed for close range, for intermediate range, for long range, and for indirect attacks (pistols, assault rifles, sniper rifles, and artillery, for example). The weapon is designed specifically to fill a battlefield need.Plasma weapons could be designed similarly.

The weapon is designed specifically to fill a battlefield need.Plasma weapons could be designed similarly. High-precision, high-velocity weapons could presumably be created for longer engagement distances, and compact, rapid-fire weapons could be made for close-quarters combat. Something in-between for the in-between engagements.Of course, we’re making an obscene number of assumptions here. Among all those, why not also assume that plasma weapons could work at ranges of 100–200 m? I see no reason why they couldn’t.",3 followers,Mark Bradford,12.8K,579,2.5M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Would-plasma-weaponry-even-be-effective-in-an-engagement-of-100-200m-Putting-the-technological-hurdles-aside-and-assuming-even-such-a-weapon-is-possible
1,"There's nothing in physics which would outright prevent a plasma weapon from having a range that long.The main point of contention is if it would ever be a practical or efficient weapon to use, particularly for infantry.Plasma carries a strong positive charge. And as you likely remember from school, that means it repels itself. You can counteract this for a while by dumping a large amount of electricity into it to create an electrically charged outer shell to contain it. We've demonstrated that the technique can be effective in a lab, producing a donut-shaped “round” with pretty decent destrucThere's nothing in physics which would outright prevent a plasma weapon from having a range that long.The main point of contention is if it would ever be a practical or efficient weapon to use, particularly for infantry.Plasma carries a strong positive charge.

You can counteract this for a while by dumping a large amount of electricity into it to create an electrically charged outer shell to contain it. We've demonstrated that the technique can be effective in a lab, producing a donut-shaped “round” with pretty decent destructive potential.Problem is, it was only effective over a range of three feet. Past that, the charge dissipated enough to let the plasma break free and disperse as it is wont to do left on its own.If you wanted to extend that range to two hundred meters, you'd need to dump a truly absurd amount of electricity into each round to keep it from dispersing. And there are an abundance of more efficient options for using that energy that would give you a result that was similar if not better in every way. Rail guns, lasers, even plain old fashioned bullets look like a better choice next to the engineering nightmare that would be a man-portable plasma rifle.",0 followers,Daiwei Xue,4K,2.1K,33.4M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Would-plasma-weaponry-even-be-effective-in-an-engagement-of-100-200m-Putting-the-technological-hurdles-aside-and-assuming-even-such-a-weapon-is-possible

3,"“Do we have the technology yet to build a spaceship that could engage and destroy another spaceship in combat?”Oh hell yes.Ever heard of Project Orion?Project Orion (nuclear propulsion) - WikipediaIt’s basically a sort of heavy-lift rocket- an extreme sort.You dig a crater and cover it with a great big thick disc of armor plate, weld some ginormous shock absorbers to the top and attach a crew cabin and whatnot on top of them.Then you set off a small nuke in the crater.Just before the thing finishes jumping about a quarter-mile straight up, you release another nuke from an onboard magazine with“Do we have the technology yet to build a spaceship that could engage and destroy another spaceship in combat?”Oh hell yes.Ever heard of Project Orion?Project Orion (nuclear propulsion) - WikipediaIt’s basically a sort of heavy-lift rocket- an extreme sort.You dig a crater and cover it with a great big thick disc of armor plate, weld some ginormous shock absorbers to the top and attach a crew cabin and whatnot on top of them.Then you set off a small nuke in the crater.Just before the thing finishes jumping about a quarter-mile straight up, you release another nuke from an onboard magazine with a fuze set to detonate at just the right distance from the disc to get the maximum thrust.
