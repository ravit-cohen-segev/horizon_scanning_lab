They were expensive (about $12,000) but a few P370s could replace a $500,000 mainframe. IBM was worried that these desktop machines would kill mainframe sales, and rightly so. They first restricted (for a while you could only buy P370s in lots of 25) and then killed the line to protect their mainframe sales.Then Xerox PARC happened and Sun came along, rolled some ideas from PARC into new high-performance workstations, and gutted IBM’s mainframe business for a while. Took quite a long time for IBM to recover.There are numerous other examples. Trying to protect a core legacy business by suppressing a new disruptive technology is one of those ideas that never goes out of style, in spite of the fact that it never works.The most successful companies are willing to jump on a new disruptive technology before a competitor does, even if it savaged an existing revenue stream. Apple is an example of a company that does this.Companies that try to “protect” core markets by suppressing disruptive technologies usually do nothing except hand a golden opportunity to competitors who otherwise can't touch them. Realistically, there is no practical way to suppress any new technology for more than a few years at most, as Kodak discovered to its doom.",356 followers,Gordon Miller,890,10K,165.5M,2017,https://www.quora.com/Do-you-support-implementing-a-new-tax-that-would-discourage-people-from-starting-businesses-creating-new-technologies-or-engaging-in-any-activities-that-would-cause-them-to-be-successful

There’s never a post-meal bitter taste, figuratively or literally.About a quarter mile from my house is a local convenience store.We commonly refer to it as Hell Mart.The man behind the desk is typically impersonal, listening to sports radio, taking his sweet time to ring you up. Upon checkout, he hands your change back without a smile, word, or any form of amiable human communication.It is unfortunate, because the place was so damn conveniently close.The straw that broke the proverbial camel’s back happened when I went in to buy ice cream from one of these refrigerated bins:(Although the one in question was far more hideous, I can assure you.)Upon grabbing the ice cream bar I realized it had melted, and the entire bin was unplugged.At the counter I said, “Hello - just a heads up. Your ice cream machine was left unplugged. Everything is probably melted or close to it. It probably needs to be replaced.”I’d venture there’s standard protocol response in situation: perhaps “Thank you” and a service call to replace everything, or plugging the machine back in.To his credit, the latter happened: I know because he said “Okay” and walked over and nonchalantly plugged the electrical cord back into the wall.A week later, I returned and tested my hypothesis that none of the ice cream had been replaced. I even reached and got a cone from the very bottom to give the shop a fighting chance.Not so.It was the sheer nastiness of ice cream that has been fully melted and refrozen. That was the last day I walked into that store.This store recently went out of business.Meanwhile, the sandwich shop is thriving and has three more locations.Respect your customers (or watch your business die).","135,533 followers",Hector Quintanilla,1.9K,1.2K,88.6M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Do-you-support-implementing-a-new-tax-that-would-discourage-people-from-starting-businesses-creating-new-technologies-or-engaging-in-any-activities-that-would-cause-them-to-be-successful

That’s ONLY Apple and Samsung right now - everyone else is less than a few percent contribution.And something will replace current mobile smart phones some day. I have NO IDEA what - no one ever does even if you are in the very industry that does the replacing. Not really - you may have a gut feel that what you are working is “big” and potentially the “next big thing” but strictly you are always wrong more often than you are right so you stay cautious yet optimistic and just stick to your nose to the critical part of getting things to work.So that means you should NEVER presume that Google, Facebook, Twitter, etc. will be around in 10–20 years - history says that’s a VERY BAD BET to assume.

24,"Yes, and I live in a small town in southeastern Arizona, about 100 miles from Mexico, but it has nothing to do with the so-called border dispute. You see, there is no emergency on the Mexican side of the border… just on the northern side where we are woefully unprepared for the few hundred asylum seekers seeking love and acceptance. There are no drug dealers from Mexico here… all our local drug dealers are Anglos seeking to inflict their venom and addictions here. There are no traffickers here, just gainfully employed Mexicans, a few of which are probably illegal, but they are a part of our coYes, and I live in a small town in southeastern Arizona, about 100 miles from Mexico, but it has nothing to do with the so-called border dispute.

There are no traffickers here, just gainfully employed Mexicans, a few of which are probably illegal, but they are a part of our community. They attend our churches, shop at our local stores (and WalMart), their children play with our children and we eat side-by-side at our local restaurants and fast-food joints. We are not afraid of them and they do not fear us. Fear seems to be the currency of the current administration and abides next to the lies, misrepresentations and hate that spews from the mouths of their supporters. We are proud Americans, proud Arizonians, proud Mexican-Americans, proud Mexicans, proud internationalists and, in many cases, anti-nationalists of all stripes.How has the government affected me? A member of our church family heads up a not-for-profit conservation organization who leases office space in the Bureau of Land Management building. Because of the government shut-down she has been locked out of her own office.

26,"Because “Palestinians” don’t leave Israeli people alone. The “Palestinians” refuse to stop launching rockets into Israel, refuse to stop stabbing innocent Israeli civilians, continue to illegally occupy Israeli land, and even steal Israeli houses, like in the Shimon HaTzaddik neighbourhood of Jerusalem.Israel has a moral obligation to protect its people.
