1,"Technology are increasing at the rapid rate,so we can't say anything right now. Technology might come in the future to end up with the pollution.We are moving towards natural renewable source of energy like sunlight, wind, hydro,etc.if the technology beacme more advance and will able to make these sources easily accessible and economically feasible, then we can think for this solution as to remove pollution completely.Now the cost of solar gadgets is quiet high,but with the time it and modernisation in technology, this problem wil also end up.Strict government policy should be there in a countTechnology are increasing at the rapid rate,so we can't say anything right now.

The nitrogen in it is laundered through the gut of a cow so that people with chemophobia feel better about it, but make no mistake, that nitrogen got there, at least in part, from chemical synthesis.We are as dependent on technology as the sailors in a nuclear submarine.
