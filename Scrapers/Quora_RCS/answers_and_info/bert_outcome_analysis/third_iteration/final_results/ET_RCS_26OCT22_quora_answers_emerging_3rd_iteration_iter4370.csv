0,No revolutionary technologies have left the lab as far as I know. Most if not all commercial hydrogen production is from natural gas and immediately used for oil refining (hydrocracking). Electrolysis is still the only industrial way to make hydrogen from electricity. Hydrogen is still difficult to transport because it diffuses through metal.,26 followers,Balaji Viswanathan,1.8K,5.6K,427.1M,2016,https://www.quora.com/Have-recent-developments-in-hydrogen-production-affected-world-oil-prices
1,"But they weren’t “early computers”. They were the latest thing and wildly exciting.In the early ’70s I wrote my first programs on punch cards, as part of a school outreach initiative from a local University. A van turned up once a week to pick up our cards and deliver the most recent output.It was an exciting introduction to a revolutionary technology, even though the Read-Eval-Print-Loop took 168 hours!So getting my hands on my friend’s BBC Acorn with a tape drive was a huge step forwards.

A van turned up once a week to pick up our cards and deliver the most recent output.It was an exciting introduction to a revolutionary technology, even though the Read-Eval-Print-Loop took 168 hours!So getting my hands on my friend’s BBC Acorn with a tape drive was a huge step forwards. Nowadays we’d consider the load times glacial, but they were orders of magnitude quicker than accessing a remote mainframe. And we soon had floppy disk drives like these and things speeded up even more.Then I set up my first business and laid out a king’s ransom on an Atari Mega ST, with an exotic 2 megs of RAM and extravagant 20 meg hard drive (from memory the drive alone cost £450 which was serious moolah in those days).What you probably don’t realise is that this was a highly functional machine. Back then, developers knew how to code for limited resources, and it ran like the wind.When I saw a demo of Windows 1 at a show it appeared laughably sluggish - the Amiga, Apricot, Atari and Mac were far superior - particularly the Apricot, which was to die for…No edition of Windows has approached the responsiveness of any of these machines - they were a joy to use. I was wildly in love with my Atari. If anything, the user experience has gone backwards. The dominance of Windows is a triumph of marketing, not of technology.My little Atari marvel ran a spreadsheet, accounting program, SQL database, FTP, Telnet, email, bulletin boards, the best WP I’ve ever used, a highly capable DTP package, vector and bitmap graphics packages, games, MIDI music… And there was good choice of compilers - I was able to play with Assembler, Basic and C.With the exception of the WWW, which hadn’t been invented, my mid-80s Atari could do pretty much everything I do today. Since then improvement has been incremental rather than revolutionary, and today’s bloated software actually runs slower, despite my high-end HP Workstation.And then I managed to blag a cheap ex-display NextStation - Steve Jobs’s wet dream and probably the sexiest machine ever built. It was so far ahead of its time it was mind-blowing.Did I feel deprived? What do you think? I thought I had entered computer heaven.Then one fine day I was browsing the CERN ftp site - they acted as a repository for the NextStep community - and spotted a mysterious folder called “WWW”.I downloaded a file named something like WorldWideWeb-0.2 and fired up a prototype web browser. It was just a proof-of-concept, so there wasn’t a public web to access at that stage. But the web was developed on the NextStation, and we were ahead of the curve. So the first point of presence that opened in the UK we shared the requisite Perl scripts and logged on. And on 1 June 1992 I was one of the first people in the word to load up a website…I was on Yahoo the day it launched. And Alta Vista. And Amazon. And Google…Does this sound “tedious” to you?These pioneering days are long gone. Nowadays I’m using a 10 year old workstation that’s more than I really need. With the exception of video streaming and video calls, nothing much has changed for a decade or two and progress has slowed to a crawl.The current generation have missed out on the real excitement.",106 followers,Geoff Caplan,2.4K,983,2.8M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Have-recent-developments-in-hydrogen-production-affected-world-oil-prices
2,"Not tedious at all. I started work in finance in 1985, and my first budget was done with pencil paper and a rubber.My second was done with an IBM PC which cost £4k ( for one) . It was the only one in the company and people used to come in and look at it.Cut my budget rework time down from 3 weeks, to one afternoon. Looked like this one belowNot tedious at all.

3,"I’ve worked with computers since the early ‘80s. And if I jumped in a time machine and had to go back and work with a Kaypro IV, it would be tedious as all hell.At the time, though? It was AMAZING. It was a leap forward from the TI-99/4A I had had before that. It ran a real word processor. It let you save your work. It let you write, save, and run your own programs. It connected to a printer. And, most critically for me as a kid, it let me revise my work without laboriously writing it all back out by hand. It made me a FAR better writer.When we got our next computer, it was AMAZING. It had a 2I’ve worked with computers since the early ‘80s.

It had a 286 processor running at a blazing 10 MHz (twice as fast as the Kaypro). It had 640K of RAM. It had a 20 MB hard drive! You didn’t have to insert a disk to get it to boot up. You didn’t have to insert a disk to run installed programs.A few years later, we got a 386, and it was AMAZING. Its processor was more than three times as fast as the 286. It had VGA graphics. It would run this cool new graphical shell called Windows. It was the computer my brother learned to program in C on.All the technology that seems positively archaic looking back was paradigm-shifting at the time. Tedious? It was the cutting edge, and it was AWESOME.",0 followers,Norton Karp,5.2K,2K,10.4M,2021,https://www.quora.com/How-tedious-was-working-with-early-computers
