1,"Nanotechnology, but in a really cool way.You remember the microbots in Big Hero 6, right? Well, unfortunately, those microbots are impossible, but there is a similar technology that’s being developed in real life.The idea is to build tiny replicators that can create more of themselves, like a sort of super bacteria that never stops replicating. Such a technology would be“…the first replicator assembles a copy in one thousand seconds, the two replicators then build two more in the next thousand seconds, the four build another four . . in less than two days, theyNanotechnology, but in a really cool way.You remember the microbots in Big Hero 6, right?

But they would have an abundance of material on Earth, especially of carbon, which would likely be the building blocks of such an assemblers. If you were carrying a jar of them and tripped and they spilled out, and they had no limit, they would quickly devour the entire earth with no way of stopping them.But here is where things get interesting: These tiny robots would have the ability to construct molecules from atoms, giving them the ability to produce amazing materials like graphene, cubes of apple, and even brain material.With advanced nanotechnology in the form of self-replicators, the entire world would experience a revolution. Think for a second about what wouldn’t change in the face of machines that can produceProduction jobs would cease. The price of every item ever created would be lowered massively. Supercomputers and experiments regarding brain material would become almost commonplace. Terraforming other planets would take years if not months. And all of this is actuallyThere is a lot of power contained within those tiny machines.",0 followers,Lucas Martin,6.4K,65,4.2M,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-upcoming-technology-are-you-really-excited-for-in-our-lifetimes

5,The best most effective technology is responsible legally-armed private citizens being in the same area to kill the mass shooter after the mass shooter’s first shot; turning the mass shooter into a single shooter… slumped on the floor.Constitutional Carry laws make that scenario possible in numerous states in the USA already (but not Florida … unfortunately).,UNKNOWN,Fred Lead,6.1K,469,1.6M,2016,https://www.quora.com/What-upcoming-technology-are-you-really-excited-for-in-our-lifetimes
6,"Guns. this has only been proven about a hundred million times. Regarding orlando, There was an off-duty police officer in that building, who fired right back at the shooter. he undoubtedly saved many lives, simply by delaying the shooter’s actions while the building was evacuated. When large police teams were called in, they had guns. and you wouldn’t want them to show up with clubs.we also shouldn’t need to wait for the police to show up. imagine how quickly that shooter could have been stopped if the night club wasn’t a gun-free zone… Gun control does not work. it has never worked. it causedGuns. this has only been proven about a hundred million times.

It was a crime for the shooter to bring a gun into that building, but he already intended to kill people. what did we expect him to do? see the “no guns” sign at the door and walk away with a dejected face?no, if a criminal walks up to a building and sees that kind of sign, he grins maniacally. because he knows nobody inside will shoot back. in fact, he targets restaurants with this sign for robberies.Our stupidity will never cease.preventing mass shootings? that’s tougher. this guy was willing to die, taking out as many people as he could, based on the teachings of his religion, and more specifically, ISIS’ interpretation of them. besides, if we could cause all firearms on the earth to blink out of existence, stabbings would increase to a higher rate than shootings ever reached. because every little old man walking down an alley who looked helpless really would be as helpless as he looked (unless he knows kung fu).",UNKNOWN,Ernest W.

7,"Well not to answer in an argumentative way I will straddle the fence and bit by saying we are a species that has shown throughout history that as individuals and as social hive minds we can be prone to violence over truly nothing so I don't think we will ever prevent them all together. Outlaw guns? Well the mass killer will get one anyway because obviously breaking that law wont be their line in the sand: “Sure Ill go kill everyone there…but he all deals are off if I have to break a law first.” If I wanted pot and I could easily obtain it.

8,"SAFEST IN AIR CRASH: This material, apart from personal opinion & experience, I have extracted from the extensive long running TV series Air Crash Investigations. A fantastic 1940s or 1950s ripping-yarn novel by British Nevil Shute describes how, when expecting plane crash, went straight to toilet, sat on the floor leaning against a wall facing backwards - though luckily plane just made it despite wing fatigue. Best seats are at or near rear isle LESS than 6 rows from an exit (count how many), because the aft & tail sections usually break off first & get separated from the forward possible burSAFEST IN AIR CRASH: This material, apart from personal opinion & experience, I have extracted from the extensive long running TV series Air Crash Investigations. A fantastic 1940s or 1950s ripping-yarn novel by British Nevil Shute describes how, when expecting plane crash, went straight to toilet, sat on the floor leaning against a wall facing backwards - though luckily plane just made it despite wing fatigue. Best seats are at or near rear isle LESS than 6 rows from an exit (count how many), because the aft & tail sections usually break off first & get separated from the forward possible burning wing fuel tank section. Plane panelling, seats & carpets, plastics etc give off deadly smoke when burning. If Cabin smoke, crawl on floor. US Navy jet fuel far less explosive than for airliners, but too expensive.SAFEST IN AIR CRASH seats are at or near rear isle LESS than 6 rows from an exit (count how many), because the aft & tail sections usually break off first & get separated from the forward possible burning wing fuel tank section; & carry a hand-generator flashlight + mobile! If Cabin smoke, crawl on floor.If plane crash impending & Captain yells ”BRACE”, almost everyone will fracture their sculls at 30G against seat & TV in front unless they immediately sit on the floor, legs under their seats & facing backwards! As incredible PROOF, in 1 violent air-crash, a little girl of about 4 somehow landed under the seat & SHE WAS THE ONLY ONE ALIVE in the entire planeload of dead passengers! That was in NORTHWEST Airline #255 in 1985 near Detroit. Who are you because you are my hero, especially if your survival can lead to vastly greater plane safety? Incredibly, even the Flying Doctor Service would not allow me to take a demo photo of my wife in such a safe position in this safe position of a grounded aircraft.Passengers in every plane are facing the dangerous WRONG WAY & should be facing BACKWARDS to save 1,000s of lives without having to brace. Boeing typically is not smart enough to figure all this in advance BEFORE BUILDING. I also face backwards in trains & at least sideways in buses.Having no emergency or portable lights seems a universal problem after crashing, especially one midnight in a swamp - so have a strong waterproof hand-generator torch & radio with SW, preferably transceiver! Bar across near feet on seat in front = breaks legs of taller folk during crash. Same happened I saw during Thai bus crash into emerging tractor... “On slide evacuations, we expect a broken leg or ankles”. 60 passengers annually are injured by turbulence!Everybody should now be terrified of flying, like us long ago. Meantime we'll stick to vastly safer budget forms of fast-enough national mass-transport including: by sail, slow train & car, tram, bus, canoe, walk, micro scooter, my TRiCAR, slow glider or Lanier (Google this) plane when there is one, & EV bikes, swim, walk, ski, ice skate, animals + carts, also big well-established motorized gliders capable of crow-flies speeds about equal to fast trains.I face backwards in trains & at least sideways in buses. Also Ground Effect Machines (GEM) which rise just above ground or waves, & incredibly frugal-running Alexander Lippisch's Ram Wing units, boats, barge, ships (certain Aussie wave-piercing ships can go as fast as buses), ocean sail-assist vessels, slower trains & trams, single-deck buses, small electric micro scooters, bikes & trikes with 25km/h top speed that can enjoy footpaths, virtually anything that stops when its engine fails (even usually arrive safely if parts fail), but planes seldom - except planes & airships with capsule parachutes, which have been proven.Sad re common road rage. Actually years ago I identified the chemical problem which is a benzene ring compound instead of tetraethyl lead to stop pre-ignition especially when idling. Previously not a problem with ‘lead’, which then made folk incredible illogical. Electric of course = emission-free cars, except where the power is generated, preferable solar with our vehicles. Well crazy car drivers - as so often on many TV shows - put us even off cars. I feel fairly safe with Di driving quite slow & so careful. In 1980s weekly for 3 years, I drove old Toyota van to Griffith Uni & at about 35mph that slowed traffic down safely for miles. When they did pass, about 1/2 scowled, the remainder happily waved understandingly – thanks to my feel-good traffic calming!Seems like train crashes, particularly high speed modern versions, are approximating plane-crash frequency - where planes are often getting more reliable.",0 followers,Lucas Martin,6.4K,65,4.2M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-upcoming-technology-are-you-really-excited-for-in-our-lifetimes
