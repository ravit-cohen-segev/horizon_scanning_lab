It's always been and always WILL be Calcutta to me!1. Calcutta is the second-largest city in India, after New Delhi. That's right! Not Mumbai, not Hyderabad, not even Bengaluru (duh! Not that it was a contender! Just saying!), but Calcutta!2. Back in the day, Calcutta used to be British India's capital city and it was the Empire's second most important city after London.3. Okay, did you know Calcutta had other nicknames besides City of Joy? For instance, it is also called the City of Processions (if you knew the political scenario in West Bengal, you'd say, ""Oh! I knew that!), the City of Palaces, and the Cultural Capital of India. Now doesn't make you want to pack your stuff and head over?!! Here's the absolutely stunning Victoria Memorial4. In terms of frequency of trains originating or passing through, Howrah station is the busiest station in India. It also has biggest station complex and is the second oldest railway station in India. Here's the mighty Howrah station (note the beginning of the Howrah Bridge in the backdrop!)5. Here's another fun fact. Did you know all the way till 2006, there was no such railway station called Calcutta or Kolkata? Yeah, no shit! There was just Howrah and Sealdah. And then some old old folks decided to rename some pansy little station called Chitpur to Kolkata and voila - we now have a Kolkata Station!6. Calcutta's Alipur Zoo, or the Kolkata Zoo  [ http://www.kolkatazoo.in/ ]even though in the miserable condition that it is in today, is India's oldest zoo!7. The first thing that comes to your mind when you Calcutta is the Rabindra Setu, right? Wait, Rabindra whaaat?? Arrey, the Howrah Bridge, re! Here's another fun fact: did you know the Howrah Bridge is one of the world's largest cantilever bridge [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_longest_cantilever_bridge_spans ]? And perhaps the only one in India? Well, it is!8. Calcutta was home to 5 Nobel Laureates - the most in any Asian Mainland city (apart from Tokyo and Kyoto). Sir Ronald Ross, Rabindranath Tagore, Sir C V Raman, Amartya Sen and Mother Teresa. Well, legendary film maker and Oscar winner Satyajit Ray, is from here, too!9. Calcutta might not have been the city of princes, but the Calcutta Polo Club is the oldest one in the world!10. The The Royal Calcutta Golf Club [ http://www.rcgc.in/ ] is the first ever golf club to be set up outside the United Kingdom!11. Here's something about the Eden Gardens [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eden_Gardens ]! Well, in terms of seating capacity of almost 70,000 (official), the Eden Gardens is the third largest stadium in the world!12. When talking about cricket, there’s one fact which even many cricket buffs do not know: founded in 1792, the Calcutta Cricket and Football Club [ http://www.ccfc1792.com/ ] is the second oldest cricket club in the world after MCC: the Mecca of Cricket13. Well, when it comes to sports, Calcuttans are crazy about their football! Founded in 1898, did you know the Calcutta Football League [ http://the-ifa.org/archives.php ] is the oldest football tournament in the country, and the second oldest in the world??...",13 followers,Nikhil Chauhan,761,71,1.5M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-best-upcoming-technology-startup-events-in-major-cities-in-India

It will be India's first high-speed rail line.[1]Most of the corridor will be elevated, except for a 21 km underground tunnel between Thane and Virar, of which 7 km will be undersea. The undersea tunnel was chosen to avoid damaging the thick vegetation present in the area. The corridor will begin at the underground station in the Bandra-Kurla Complex in Mumbai, and then traverse 21 km underground before emerging above ground at Thane.Construction of the corridor was began by August 2018 by acquiring land for Sabarmati terminus, and the first high speed train is scheduled to leave for its first run on 15 August 2022.[2][3] The corridor will use Japan Railways Shinkansen E5 Series Electric multiple unit for it's rollingSources : GoogleJai Hind !",UNKNOWN,Elson D'Souza,684,66,160.1K,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-best-upcoming-technology-startup-events-in-major-cities-in-India

It's made up of virtual coins that can be traded using a computer or phone. This all started after the crash in 2008 when many people lost confidence in the existing financial systems.Crypto's origins can be traced back to libertarian ideas. What if there was money that wasn't attached to these traditional institutions that have caused so much financial chaos around the globe? It's the original decentralized cryptocurrency, which means there is no regulatory body, government or otherwise, that oversees it. To this day, Bitcoin is the most popular cryptocurrency, and by far the most valuable. Around the start of the pandemic, in March 2020, a single Bitcoin was valued around $5,000. On April 1st of this year, one coin was worth around $46,000. That's wild, by the way, just to even say it.In fact, there is also the idea that someone who thinks that the chance is missed and investing in crypto is late is not right. This is a young industry and growth will be 100%. You also need to understand that in addition to growth there will be development of services for crypto, such as wallets, exchanges and special banks. If you want to make money on crypto, it's easier than it may seem. I was a beginner and started to do it on Kyrrex. Initially I just wanted to save crypto there because I was told it was a reliable platform, but then I saw all the possibilities and realized I could also earn there through deposits or simple trading.

While China has already started a trade war against the latter and is planning to build a $1 trillion AI industry by 2030. That being said, back home we are figuring out 10 predictions on artificial intelligence in 2030. In 1957, when USSR launched the world’s first-ever artificial satellite, Sputnik 1, the US went berserk and got into a frenzy of competition. And this histrionic tug of war finally led the humans to land on the moon.Now 60 years later, we are most likely going to have our “Sputnik” moment, provided the artificial intelligence war continues between the US and China. The tug war this time is not to put the first step on the moon but to become the AI world leader.The AI arms race continues…However, it was China and not the USA, who took the first wakeup call. China created the first-ever AlphaGo, an AI-enabled computer program designed for the board game, Go. This first-ever AI-led computer game was invented by a Chinese company, DeepMind based in London. In 2016, South Korean master Lee Se-dol had lost to AlphaGo at the ancient Chinese board game Go. And in 2017, this AI game had also defeated the Chinese world champion, Ke Jie.Impressed by the newly enabled AI platform as a service and realizing its potential, the Chinese Govt. decided to invest in the then-upcoming AI technology in full bloom. After two years of its inception, China is determinedAnthony Mullen, Research Director at Gartner had this to say,“Right now, AI is a two-horse race between China and the US.” And, says Mullen, China has all the ingredients it needs to move into first. These include government funding, a massive population, a lively research community, and a society that seems primed for technological change.”This brings us to ask the trillion-dollar question –Who is going to win the AI race – the US or China?Who’s going to make the killing?While China is ushering on its 1.4 billion population to build a data mine for its artificial intelligence service offerings, the US, on the other hand, has alone invested $76 billion out of the total $176 billion investment in the AI sector worldwide.While other countries like Russia are trying to win the rat race, the above-mentioned rivals are already in a bid to cut each other’s throat by becoming the world’s biggest contemporaries in digital transformation that includes artificial intelligence, IoT, VR, big data, etc. whether it’s Luke vs Darth Vader, Alien vs Predator, Rocky vs Ivan Drago.10 predictions on artificial intelligence in 2030Just as the world witnessed the moon landing that has resulted from the Sputnik war, similarly we will indeed experience a revolution in this advanced technology following this tug of war. Taking this opportunity, we’ve narrowed down 10 predictions on artificial intelligence in 2030 and how it is going to disrupt industries and humans on the whole.We have divided our list of 12 AI predictions into two parts –What will be artificial intelligence in the next 6 years i.e. by 2024?#Prediction 1Enormously empowered by technology, machines, and devices will be able to recognize objects and translate speech in real-time. While devices like ALEXA is able to do speech recognition, Google has already started working on their deep learning to enhance the speech recognition technology. Watch this video –With the speed it’s evolving, we’re pretty sure we’re going to witness something as shown in the Tom Cruise-starrer 2002 movie, Minority Report in 2024.#Prediction 2Alexa, Google Home, Siri, and Cortana will learn to adjust to your changing life.Artificial intelligence solutions and NLS (natural language systems) will become more pervasive. AI assistants will be able to learn to anticipate your requirements and likeness without you having to explicitly feed in information about yourself just was with the case of the 20th century’s robots. Smart context-oriented visual interfaces will be in use, thus augmenting the in-depth interactions.#Prediction 3Devices and machines will run individually.Next-gen airplanes will be self-controlled. Most likely they won’t even have a cockpit.Here’s an excerpt,In the future, AI will play an even bigger role, from working out what information to show the pilot to take full control of the plane. Bowman thinks that humans will be managers rather than being replaced. He envisions a human controlling a swarm of 20 drones while onboard a plane being flown by AI.Plane manufacturers like Airbus are all geared up to develop artificial intelligence-enabled engines that will enable computers to fly planes without human pilots in the near future.#Prediction 4Walmart Stores harnesses AI to optimize inventories and supply chains by predicting future demand and reordering stock. Monsanto uses artificial intelligence to identify the most promising molecules in bioengineering. John Deere (DE) expects AI to reduce chemical spraying volumes in farming. And shale oil producer Devon Energy (DVN) uses AI to guide drilling gear.Almost every enterprise, from the top players to the startups, would have integrated artificial intelligence in their businesses by 2024.Here are the statistics on revenues for AI applications in businesses worldwide from 2016 to 2025 in million USD –AI will continue to be rigorously adopted by businesses across the globe worldwide, thereby enabling them to extract data from the entire data ocean that is being generated.#Prediction 5In the recently released movie, Escape Plan 2, a robot is seen treating a person in one of the scenes.AI is going to dramatically disrupt medical diagnostic procedures. Determining the available artificial intelligence use cases in medicine, we have predicted that AI solutions will do for medicine in the next 6 years similar to what the stethoscope had done hundreds of years ago. Besides managing the mammoth-sized paperwork, AI services will offer the perfect surgical robots and finely tuned diagnostic algorithms to solve complex surgical and clinical problems.Now let’s have a look at the bigger picture…Artificial Intelligence in another 6 years i.e. (2024-2030)#Prediction 6Image source:If the teaching method is not changed today, 30 years from now, the education industry is going to be in trouble, said Jack Ma, founder of Alibaba Group.Future academics will be led by artificial intelligence and blockchain technology. AI will grow beyond what we know today just as Dr. Will Caster, the role played by Johnny Depp in the 2014 movie, Transcendence.With an influx of advanced AI-led learning models, traditional educational methods are bound to take a quantum leap in the next decade. Due to digital transformation, one-to-one tutoring will more likely replace the traditional method on an enormous scale. Computers will take up the role of individual tutors in classrooms filled with diverse learning styles.#Prediction 7Digital ‘alter egos’ – the AI assistants will be doing the job of a full-time employee usually reserved for the elite class in 2045.Enhanced personal hypothesis systems will create an entirely new artificial ecosystem. AI will disrupt the design, curation, and improvement of the already existing AI-induced algorithms.#Prediction 8In future, IoT won’t work without artificial intelligence.The millennials have already grown to get used to the Internet. In future, IoT won’t work without artificial intelligence. However, advanced technologies like AI and smart connected devices are future-proof and are shaping new far-reaching developments. These cutting-edge technologies will be inducted into all the possible aspects of our lifestyle and all industries including cloud computing and big data/analytics.AI will be used with IoT to develop and strengthen man and machine partnership. For example, AI capabilities in the wall of an operating room will enable smart devices to understand their environment, and then reason and learn. A whole new artificial intelligence ecosystem will boom in the next 12 years targeting everything from healthcare, transportation, and telecom to public safety and banking.#Prediction 9The future of hardware is AI.Quantum computing extensions will be commonplace by 2030. Landmark developments in artificial intelligence distribution across multiple machines will recast the data transaction procedure. In the next 12 years, algorithms will run in parallel efficiently over thousands of Graphical Processing Units (GPUs) on each computer.Deep learning as initiated by Google relies heavily on the jaded mathematical computations. Artificial neural networks, convolutional neural networks, and recurrent neural networks are some of the futuristic aspects of deep learning. Irrespective of what kind of neural network is used, all the deep learning algorithms will be running complicated statistical computations. Right from managing the stock market data to storing the radiology report, everything will be first decoded into a set of numbers with the help of AI.#Prediction 10Artificial intelligence will be vulnerable.AI is no more confined to making Alexa or chatbots. Superpowers like US and Russia are seriously considering weaponizing AI. US is determined to make use of the AI to the extreme to maintain its military dominance.The United States has put AI at the center of its quest to maintain its military dominance. In 2014, the Pentagon had reportedly announced the US $18 billion for its ‘Future Years Defense Program’, which will be spent in allocating robotics, autonomous systems, and human-machine collaboration. China, on the other hand, is not left behind. As per the reports, the Chinese People’s Liberation Army has begun integrating artificial intelligence technology into unmanned weapon systems which include aircraft, drones, and submarines.And while the tug war continues among the US, China & Russia, it’s pretty obvious that artificial intelligence will change the world at breakneck speed. And as we write, already history is in the making in various sectors across industries through AI and IoT.","5,360 followers",Valerio Cietto,677,2.4K,9.1M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-best-upcoming-technology-startup-events-in-major-cities-in-India
