When time was almost up, I would walk back and hand in the exam paper.For a small college feel and the top science institute, you should choose Caltech. I spent two of my summers doing research there (before SURF), and the experience was very valuable for my immediate future. Many years on, I left chemistry and entered computers as a profession.Cambridge is an incredible place to live although rather crowded. I lived in East Cambridge for several years.And so it goes. Ask yourself who you are and what you expect from your undergraduate experience. I can tell you as a Caltech graduate that I was admitted to Harvard and Columbia graduate schools. Columbia, a top-five chemistry graduate school, was child’s play after Caltech.Nevertheless, I might have done better to do my undergraduate studies at Occidental College, my backup college choice and then moved on to graduate studies at Caltech or whatever seemed right at the time.",936 followers,Alicia Ouyang,828,497,3.1M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Which-are-the-top-six-ERP-Enterprise-Resource-Planning-technology-trends-in-2016
3,"I did my undergrad at Caltech and spent six summers at Stanford, where I met and worked with hundreds of Stanford students from a broad variety of disciplines.  Still, my perspective is probably skewed for several reasons.  First, I was at Caltech during the regular school year, but at Stanford during the summer.  I can't, for example, compare dorm life accurately, or compare Apache to Exotic Erotic.  Second, I haven't spent much time at many other universities than these two, so this answer might be more of a response to ""What's strange about Caltech?"" than ""What does a Caltech student noticeI did my undergrad at Caltech and spent six summers at Stanford, where I met and worked with hundreds of Stanford students from a broad variety of disciplines.  Still, my perspective is probably skewed for several reasons.  First, I was at Caltech during the regular school year, but at Stanford during the summer.  I can't, for example, compare dorm life accurately, or compare Apache to Exotic Erotic.  Second, I haven't spent much time at many other universities than these two, so this answer might be more of a response to ""What's strange about Caltech?"" than ""What does a Caltech student notice when spending time at Stanford, specifically?""  Finally, at least in my first summer or two at Stanford, I was still bitter that Stanford hadn't accepted me, and so I tended to be judgmental towards Stanford students, thinking ""So Stanford thinks that So-And-So was more deserving of admission than me!  That's absurd.  So-And-So sucks!"".  Fortunately, I eventually grew up, at least a little bit, and lost that attitude.Disclaimer complete, here's my opinion:The most obvious difference is that Caltech does not have ""fuzzies"" - people whose primary focus is in the arts or humanities, and more importantly whose lifestyles and worldviews are not tempered by the habit of approaching problems in an essentially quantitative way.  It also lacks the cultures of jock, greek life, pre-law, business, activist, and pre-med students.  There were certainly some Caltech students interested in arts, sports, law, business, politics, or medicine, but they were minorities, and did not seem to me to form subcultures.  (I personally didn't think of Fleming as a jock subculture; I thought of them as nerds who used sports and ""ra-ra"" spirit to create a house identity.  They were essentially seeking a specific social atmosphere, and sports were not essential to it.  Similarly, Ricketts didn't consist of Satanists.)This isn't to say Caltech was not diverse - you could find almost every sort of oddball there!  But at Caltech, unlike at Stanford, the breadth of individual personalities far outstripped that of the students' interests, activities, and focus.There were many other sociological and academic differences.  Ultimately I have no way of establishing whether these stemmed from relative sizes and diversities of the schools, but it is natural for me to interpret them that way.Academically, my perception was that the better students from Stanford and Caltech were indistinguishable.  At Stanford, I was a teaching assistant at an academic summer camp for high school students.  I would spend seven weeks on campus helping teach a class of these students about relativity and quantum mechanics.  It was a residential camp, so I lived in the dorms with the students and the other TAs.  Math students are less likely than physics students to do summer research (and hence more likely to come TA at the camp), and so especially in mathematics I met many absolutely amazing Stanford students who continually sparked my enthusiasm.  When living and interacting with the same people, and discussing technical topics with them, you naturally develop a feeling for their depth of understanding, way of approaching problems, enthusiasm for the subject, and raw ability.  I found that these attributes were basically the same in math and physics majors at Caltech and Stanford.  (However, I also noticed that the physics track at Stanford put people off more frequently than at Caltech, and I met a lot of Stanford people who were doing CS or engineering because they thought the physics major was unsupportive and uninteresting.  At Caltech, I met people who stopped doing physics because they thought it was too hard, but usually not because they thought it was poorly-constructed, uninsightful, etc.)In engineering or CS, I thought the situation was slightly different.  Again, the better students from Stanford and Caltech seemed mostly indistinguishable (except that in these disciplines, Caltech students tend to like more theoretical topics, especially in CS, compared to Stanford students), but I also thought that it was somewhat easier to get by as a mediocre student at Stanford than at Caltech.  For example, I met mechanical engineers at Stanford who had muddled their way though without understanding  things like statics or Newton's laws clearly.  These were generally the people either uninterested, or only with a very specific interest, in their  academic subject.   I think they had a somewhat higher washout rate at Caltech, because I found fewer of them there.I can't compare the other disciplines because I didn't know as many biology or chemistry people at Stanford, and there weren't any Russian Literature majors at Caltech.  For the most part, the general Caltech attitude towards everyone who's not a scientist is what Jessica Su said - we just didn't pay them any mind.  When we did, it was probably with a mildly-superior attitude of feeling like you're doing something more concrete, useful, and difficult, but also with an attitude of bewilderment at the interests and lifestyles of fuzzies or business people.Socially, I will put down whatever few observations come to mind.Stanford was geared more towards the mainstream than Caltech.  ""The Game"" is less oddball than Ditch Day.  The parties are more typical college parties at Stanford than at Caltech.  The students' interests in sports and politics were more typical at Stanford (in that they actually existed).Stanford students seemed happier.  However, this may be largely due to my summer/school year bias.Stanford students seemed to have a healthier attitude towards education.  When I met Stanford students in different fields, they frequently talked about their most interesting classes, the research they were contributing to, the internships they wanted to get, and their career goals.  Caltech students tended to spend an inordinate amount of time discussing how hard their classes were, how overworked they were, and how nobody was supporting them.  I think other Caltech students will disagree, but my perception was that a big part of Caltech's stereotype of being incredibly academically difficult and rigorous was overblown by the students.  Caltech students tended to claim they were always working, but if you watched their personal habits, they would goof off or procrastinate all day, then start their homework at 10pm.  Stanford students seemed to have a slightly better balance of doing work, then going to play/pursue other personal interests.  Furthermore, Caltech seemed to have a sort of ""culture of genius"".  It was accepted that some people were very genius, and some were a little bit genius, and some were ""Caltech stupid"", meaning intelligent and impressive in most settings, but below the mean at Caltech.  Students tended to develop sorts of rankings of each other based on technical ability, and it had some contribution to social status.  I should emphasize this was not a ubiquitous phenomenon.  Also, it's something that I did myself, especially early on, and had to consciously try to eliminate.  I may be impressing myself on other students.  Still, I thought it was an unhealthy attitude, and I noticed less of it at Stanford.Caltech students were better communicators and collaborators.  Caltech had a very strong community feel and a very strong atmosphere of trust.  These weren't absent at Stanford, but they were unusually strong at Caltech.  Additionally, I think that the universal background in science led Caltech students in general to parse their ideas carefully, state what they meant plainly, and in general communicate clearly.  My opinion of Stanford students was that they were less capable of understanding things I thought I communicated clearly and unambiguously.  This was compounded by a difference in speech patterns.  At Caltech, it was normal to use scientific or mathematical jargon in an everyday context.  For example, ""first-order approximation, systematic error, degenerate solution"" are all phrases that you might use while chatting about the house mural policy during lunch.  At Stanford, if I used these phrases in ordinary conversation, even people who understood their meaning thought it was a strange form of expression, or that I was making a sort of joke, when I fact it was instinctual and I hadn't given the phrase any particular consideration.Finally, Caltech is much more nerdy.  Same person, but at Stanford I was a nerd.  At Caltech I was a jock.",0 followers,Augustus Zhao,842,526,5.4M,2011,https://www.quora.com/Who-are-top-10-coders-from-BP-Poddar-Institute-of-Management-and-Technology
