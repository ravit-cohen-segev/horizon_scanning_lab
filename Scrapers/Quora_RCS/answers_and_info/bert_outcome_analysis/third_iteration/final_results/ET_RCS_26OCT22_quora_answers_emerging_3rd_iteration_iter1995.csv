0,"5G is expected to be rolled out in India by the end of this year or by next year. Recently, auctions were held for Spectrum distribution and in that auction, there were two 5G bands as well. Also, the Minister of Telecommunications has announced the arrival of 5G by the end of this year. But, this may be delayed because of the ongoing second wave of Covid-19.","113,619 followers",Anuradha Tiwari,4.2K,0,0,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-future-of-5G-in-a-country-like-India
1,"What are the upcoming 5G networks in India?I think 5G in India is still a distant dream as of now. Though Jio has announced its 5G network in India and the Indians much be really excited but if you see the reality, most of the Indian smartphones are not equipped to receive 5G signals and are dependent on 4G only. No doubt Snapdragon has offered many 5G chipsets and even MediaTek is coming up with new 5G chipsets every single day, I think the entire 2020 would go away in testing 5G signals and there are no evidences that 5G might be available in India by the end of 2020.So I think while the netWhat are the upcoming 5G networks in India?I think 5G in India is still a distant dream as of now.

It is not a hidden fact that countries like China and Japan are already using 5G and are testing capabilities for the next generation network. However, even 5G in India is not that obtainable any soon because there is a vast bit of testing already left.","84,237 followers",Igor Markov,3.3K,3.9K,49.8M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-future-of-5G-in-a-country-like-India

3,"When 5G mobile networks come to India, they will use a new radio technology and a different network architecture to deliver higher bandwidth G (LTE) and 3G networks we have today. 5G promises peak data speeds of up to 10 Gbps – up to 100 times faster than the 100 Mbps of 4G. Latency, a measure of the time it takes data to travel from the phone to the distant server, could be less than a millisecond in 5G networks, or 60-120 times better than 4G.

Well, unfortunately, those microbots are impossible, but there is a similar technology that’s being developed in real life.The idea is to build tiny replicators that can create more of themselves, like a sort of super bacteria that never stops replicating. Such a technology would be“…the first replicator assembles a copy in one thousand seconds, the two replicators then build two more in the next thousand seconds, the four build another four . . in less than two days, theyNanotechnology, but in a really cool way.You remember the microbots in Big Hero 6, right?

But they would have an abundance of material on Earth, especially of carbon, which would likely be the building blocks of such an assemblers. If you were carrying a jar of them and tripped and they spilled out, and they had no limit, they would quickly devour the entire earth with no way of stopping them.But here is where things get interesting: These tiny robots would have the ability to construct molecules from atoms, giving them the ability to produce amazing materials like graphene, cubes of apple, and even brain material.With advanced nanotechnology in the form of self-replicators, the entire world would experience a revolution. Think for a second about what wouldn’t change in the face of machines that can produceProduction jobs would cease. The price of every item ever created would be lowered massively. Supercomputers and experiments regarding brain material would become almost commonplace. Terraforming other planets would take years if not months. And all of this is actuallyThere is a lot of power contained within those tiny machines.",139 followers,Nakul Kaushal,1.8K,0,0,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-future-of-5G-in-a-country-like-India
