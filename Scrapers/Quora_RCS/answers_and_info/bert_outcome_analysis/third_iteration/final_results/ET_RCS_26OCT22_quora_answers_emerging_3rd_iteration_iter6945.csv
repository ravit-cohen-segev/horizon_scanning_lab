1,"MMRCA 2.0 is not going to happen, it will be scraped or divided.The only fighter worth considering is the Rafale but it is too costly. Eurofighter Typhoon is good but it is costlier than Rafale and has too many components from too many countries.So maybe buy another 36 Rafales that will add 2 squadrons. No need to wait for F4 since it will take a long time. Just look at it so sleek !! :)IAF needs 40 - 42 squadrons ASAP since we are at 30–31 squadrons now. IAF is down by at least 10 squadrons because of phasing out old aircraft, which will go down more as we retire Mig 21s and Jaguars etc.NextMMRCA 2.0 is not going to happen, it will be scraped or divided.The only fighter worth considering is the Rafale but it is too costly.

These are the future, 6th gen aircrafts are expected to be like this. If IAF inducts it they will be at the cutting edge and with some TOT ( Russians will surely not give 100% tot) we can save a lot in R&D and in future produce our own.There is no need to buy Mig 35 or SU 35, they are very similar to Mig 29 and SU 30MKI. They are just marginally better than what we have. No point in spending billions for slightly better tech.IAF is already down in squadron strength it should not also sacrifice quality.After that just let Private players manufacture and assemble Tejas, HAL production line is horrible, just 16 Aircraft a year. If they allow at least 3 private defense contractors like Tata, L&T or Reliance alongside HAL then we can get at least 40–50 Tejas per year much better than 16 and the Squadron gap can be closed.","99,918 followers",Alcatraz Dey,752,1.4K,68.3M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Why-are-the-competitors-of-the-MMRCA-2-stating-that-their-fighter-aircraft-technology-will-help-India-greatly-in-building-its-AMCA-when-they-will-transfer-their-technologies-to-their-partner-private-sectors-and-not-1

The aircraft was a DC-10, the exact aircraft in the picture below:A little over an hour into the flight, the engine mounted in the tail suffered an uncontained failure — in essence the turbine exploded and in doing so took out the entire aircraft’s hydraulic control system thus rendering the aircraft uncontrollable by normal means.Luckily there were not only the Captain and First Officer in the cockpit but also a Training Check Airman.After the failure, the Captain determined that the aircraft was unresponsive to the pilot’s controls as it began an uncommanded roll to the right and the nose began dropping. This should well have been the precursor to the aircraft’s completely loss of control and almost assuredly the loss of all lives onboard.Note: Airline pilots have Emergency Check Lists for every emergency scenario that can be thought of. Except, of course, this one.Rather that reiterating the details — which are available in the Wikipedia link below — the pilots ultimately tried something they had never been trained for, and used the power on the remaining two engines, including the use of asymmetric thrust (more power on one side than the other), to control the aircraft onto final approach at Sioux City Iowa.Ultimately, control was lost in the last few seconds, but only 111 of the 296 passengers and crew were lost, 35 due to smoke inhalation which indicates they survived the crash landing.Let’s be clear about something. Since this type of failure had never been experienced in this model of aircraft before, there is a very small likelihood that an automated aircraft without human intervention would have been able to save the aircraft from complete loss of control, not to mention its ultimate miraculous arrival.This tragedy was no worse than it was because there were PILOTS ONBOARD who used their collective experience to regain control of an aircraft that was on the brink of loss of control.No, I like knowing there are living breathing folks sitting up on the fight deck that I can complain about when they hammer a landing. :-)United Airlines Flight 232 - Wikipedia",17 followers,Randy Duncan,12.2K,1.1K,34.1M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Why-are-the-competitors-of-the-MMRCA-2-stating-that-their-fighter-aircraft-technology-will-help-India-greatly-in-building-its-AMCA-when-they-will-transfer-their-technologies-to-their-partner-private-sectors-and-not-1

5,"It is far, far more complicated than mere regulation.The only transportation we have now that is fully autonomous are trains in closed loop systems such as those in major airports like Atlanta and DFW. These are one dimensional only (x axis) and being closed loop have no collision hazard as all the traffic is controlled by one central control. Non-closed loop trains still have a monitor or operator even if the train is controlled centrally.

Anyone who doesn’t live in a cave has heard of the Google cars. They are not yet ubiquitous and wide spread. But they will be.We do not yet have fully autonomous pilotless aircraft. Even the Predator has a pilot/operator who sits in a room somewhere across the world like Nellis AFB or Fairfax VA.All those ground based systems have the advantage of being able to stop where they are at almost any time. Somewhere in the code for the operating system for all those cars and trains is a line of code that says essentially “if x,y or z happens apply the brakes” stop right there and wait for instructions. This cannot happen in an aircraft. Despite the numerous backups on modern aircraft power failures do happen, electrical and propulsion. (See: Sullenberger) How do you code a computer to land on the Hudson?It will cost trillions of dollars to change the existing infrastructure. Many billions of dollars of aircraft will have to be built or retrofitted to allow autonomous flight. Simple tasks such as raising the landing gear would have to be automated. That’s a simple technological challenge to be sure, but it and dozens of other routine switches and controls would all need to be changed and proven. There is a huge amount to be done just on the aircraft side. ATC would also need to be modified.It’s going to take a lot of convincing and time before most people will get on a fully autonomous aircraft. It will happen first on cargo carriers such as UPS and Fedex.It is going to be sometime before a fully autonomous aircraft carries a plane load of passengers.",9 followers,Andrew McGregor,833,13K,67.2M,2016,https://www.quora.com/With-the-rapid-development-in-aircraft-technology-will-there-be-an-introduction-of-self-flying-airplanes-in-the-next-10-20-years-and-will-it-affect-the-pilots-as-an-occupation

The same sort of great thinkers that spent 200 years claiming heavier than air flight was impossible had to eventually shut up because there were wrong for 200 years and never were smart enough to know it. The current rash of “jobs will never go away” people are just as misguided.Jobs today are currently being replaced as fast they are being destroyed for two reasons. The first, and most important, is that society forces everyone to create new jobs for themselves if they want to eat. If you can’t find a normal job, you have to become self-employed and stand on a street corner and beg for money so you can eat. Or you become a criminal and steal for a living. Or you “fall in love” with a rich person and use their money to eat. Work, or die, that’s the society we live in, and that is preventing our work weeks and retirement age from shrinking as automation grows. If we had learned to start sharing the wealth of our automated economy people would be working for less than 40 hours a week and would be retiring sooner. That hasn’t happened because we haven’t learned to share, especially in places like the US and other underdeveloped nations.The second reason that we keep working is that our automation and AI aren’t as smart as humans yet. Our intelligence keeps us useful to the economy, it gives us a monopoly that pays. Even minimum wage workers have adaptive learning skills that surpass the best and most expensive AI systems. We cope with the unexpected far better than any AI current AI system.Currently, AI systems are smarter than any human but only in limited domains, like playing chess or Go, or other specific tasks. They don’t have our general adaptive learning skills yet. But every year, the scope and power of our AI systems expand. AI research has been on a constant growth path for 50 years whereas humans are not smarter today than they were 50 years ago. We are standing still, and AI is growing at lightning speeds compared to human intelligence.But in the next couple of decades, AI systems are on track to reach general human intelligence and then fly right past us. When this happens, the monopoly on intelligence that makes us useful to the economy will vanish. We will become outdated, unemployable workers that can’t compete with the machines for any job any more than we can do math better than a calculator today.It will take more than just the powerful technology for us to lose our jobs. The entire economy has to be retooled to convert from a human-centric workforce to an automated workforce that will take decades. Just as the internet explode in the 1990s once technology passed a cost and power threshold but here we are in 2022, almost 30 years later, still trying to retool our society to convert the entire economy to a network-connected phone app. The conversion from an economy driven by human workers to one driven by machines will take time as well. But in time, humans will no longer work for a living at all. The machines will do all the stuff we call “work” today.But most importantly, we have to stop forcing everyone into wage slavery before we can take advantage of automation. We will still need to use capitalism for the machine economy to optimize itself to maximize the gq2uality and value of goods being delivered. But we won’t have to work to get money to pend. People will get their money as a free handout, just like we don’t have to pay for the right to vote, and won’t have to be wage saves for the right to use a share of the robotic output. Everyone will get free money in the form of a Basic Income from birth to death. This will represent our individual share of the output of the automated economy. We will convert society from one driven by competition and wage slavery, into one where people are truly free to do whatever they want with their lives. We will be very busy working to create the best life we can, but we won’t be slaves to money anymore.We should already be using a Basic Income system today to share the wealth of automation. But because most people can’t understand what is happening, we cling to a backward view of work and purpose that makes everyone wage slaves that can’t even afford to retire anymore while the 1% control trillions of dollars of automation wealth like Bezos, Zuckerberg, etc.Even though people could still work for money in a post automation society, it won’t be a job in the sense it is today. Just as someone might pick up a hobby business for the fun of it in retirement today, people in the future might have hobby jobs as well. We will do some type of work because it’s something we find it fun and enjoyable, and the money we make will not support us, but it will help pay for our hobby. It's easy to have a hobby job when all your basic survival needs are taken care of with a pension — which is what everyone will have staring at birth in the post-automation world. So though some people will choose to charge for their hobby work, it won’t be anything like the “jobs” of today in our work or die world, so I don’t think it’s fair to call them “jobs”.

As a person who considers themselves “old fashioned”, I enjoy the long meaningful conversations with others and pastimes which do not require today’s technology (video games, cell phones, computers, etc.).Now if you’re talking about the benefit of the human race, then advancement in technology is crucial. Many problems which we cannot yet solve or understand exist due to lack of technological advancement.I do not believe we humans will stop innovating and excelling with technology, since there are those who cannot live with no answer to a problem. But do keep in mind; as technology advances, the difficulty of their matter increases as well.Take the invention of the transistor for example, without this breakthrough computers wouldn’t be what they are today. Computers have advanced plenty as well, at one point the processing power of an iPhone was only possible with computers the size of a large room. As Moore’s law states the cost of computer processors will increase as their complexity and power grows as well. To the point where it will no longer be beneficial to produce the processors, therefore requiring another advancement in technology to fix the issue.It may seem redundant to fix a problem and another arises, then fix that problem because the solution to the initial problem isn’t perfect (and never will be) and the cycle continues, only the next solution will require more time to solve.Overall advancement in technology is necessary if the human race is in it to survive. The internal combustion engine was a great invention, but as a result the earth would become polluted. If engineers stopped with the first generation and never bothered to create efficiency, how do you think our skies would look like now? Im sure we would be far worse than we are today.",0 followers,Amit Das,9K,51,1.4M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Why-are-the-competitors-of-the-MMRCA-2-stating-that-their-fighter-aircraft-technology-will-help-India-greatly-in-building-its-AMCA-when-they-will-transfer-their-technologies-to-their-partner-private-sectors-and-not-1

If not then have a look at these pictures.If you are thinking that these images have been edited, then let me tell you one thing: that these are real.Crown shynessThe effect usually occurs between trees of the same species and sometimes between different species.One theory assumes a tree's leaves can feel when they are approaching another tree. Once they sense a nearing neighbor, the growing process halts, ensuring that light can penetrate the canopy and photosynthesis continue.Another possible explanation is that this is a defense mechanism against leaf-eating insects. The gaps mean bugs wouldn't be able to reach other trees, impeding their spread.The next time you're out walking through the forest, take a moment to look above you and you might be pleasantly surprised by what you find.Edit 1: Thanks Robert Taylor for the correction.Edit 2: Thank you all for your love, affection, and kind comments.",6 followers,Ryan Burner,1.6K,0,0,2017,https://www.quora.com/With-the-rapid-development-in-aircraft-technology-will-there-be-an-introduction-of-self-flying-airplanes-in-the-next-10-20-years-and-will-it-affect-the-pilots-as-an-occupation

More people will be able to do what they want, and that's a good thing.#5: Because we probably have a lack of innovation in certain (female oriented) sub-industries because there are fewer women in tech.People are less likely to start a company in a sub-industry that has no relationship to them. Thus, with fewer women in tech, the tech world will make much less of an impact on those fields. In others, innovations that could be happening probably aren't.#6: Because women may think, act, or approach problems differently.Having a company made up of people who approach problems in different ways is good. For example, the woman on your team might be more likely to draw out the opinions of the quiet people.Diversity of thought is good for business!","2,493 followers",Dave Whittle,2K,3.2K,8.9M,2013,https://www.quora.com/With-the-rapid-development-in-aircraft-technology-will-there-be-an-introduction-of-self-flying-airplanes-in-the-next-10-20-years-and-will-it-affect-the-pilots-as-an-occupation
