Well, a few reasons are:The Latin alphabet. Even today there are fewer than 200 characters in the English character set including punctuation and math symbols, while Chinese has thousands. Making a punch to make the matrix to cast the type can take a day or more by hand. So a basic set of punches for a new press will take about 7 months to make; a basic set of punches for Chinese will take more than 10 YEARS to make.The alloy Gutenberg cameWell, the printing press was invented THREE times: first in Korea, then in China, and finally in Germany.Why was Gutenberg's invention the one that spread?

Making a punch to make the matrix to cast the type can take a day or more by hand. So a basic set of punches for a new press will take about 7 months to make; a basic set of punches for Chinese will take more than 10 YEARS to make.The alloy Gutenberg came up with, lead, tin, and antimony was so superlatively good it is still used TODAY, almost 600 years later!Gutenberg came up with the hand mold, a fast, efficient way to make large amounts of identical type slugs quickly. You need to make a punch for each character; this is done using counterpunches to ensure uniformity in your font (think the shape of the inside of the lower case b, d, p, q for example). Making a punch is a difficult and tedious proceess; there are several excellent videos on YouTube on how to do it. Once you have the punch, you use this to make a matrix to put into the hand mould and make the type slugs. Then you need to ensure their uniformity. THEN you use them to typeset a document, ensure it is spelled and laid out properly, and only then can you actually print it, bind it, and then sell it.He also came up with the formula for the ink.Now, considering all the work that went into getting that document ready, what is the advantage of printing over handwriting? Two advantages spring immediately to mind: SPEED and UNIFORMITY. Once you have the finalized page typeset, you can make more than 3,000 copies per day using only two people per page. And those copies are IDENTICAL.This led immediately to the growth of literacy, as the price of books fell to the point more people could afford them. Another consequence was the spread of ideas. It also led to the growth of science; after all, science depends on replicating and extending other people's experiments; how do you do that if you don't know what someone else did?As you can see, printing came about in three separate areas in a period of about 200 years; the technology required was just not invented until need called it forth.Just my $0.02",34 followers,Rahul Chauhan,7.4K,2.5K,101.2M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Which-is-more-of-a-revolutionary-technology-the-printing-press-or-social-media

I could not figure out the registrar’s office, or funding, or bursaries etc. I had a paper due and printing it out in the computer lab had me all confused. My parents convinced me to take courses that were out of my league and by December, my year was a mess. I hid out the rest of the year, telling my parents that I failed my courses. But it was worse than that. I did not fail really — I flaked out.I think my grade averages for the term were 15, 8 , 0, 0 & 0.On the other hand, I knew I was smarter than that. I also had some really clever ideas to study. I went back to part-time school at 27, taking one course to see how it would go. Got an A. Then I took two summer courses. Both A+. Eventually I finished with very good marks and went to grad school to become a librarian. Now I have a PhD in public policy and am doing a post-doc in History with a large amount of complex coding and quantitative analysis.Oh yeah — Thanks to some frugality and the support of friends and family, I finished my degrees with no debt.In short, no. 28 is not too old to start university.

I used to prefer peace over money.People crave to look stylish, everyone is obsessed with their looks and their brand outfits, but I neither gave importance to my look nor about my outfits.I always had a dream to leave this materialistic world and to take oath as a saint in Himalayas.I believed in simplicity.I believed in “Don’t be workaholic and money minded person, because the white cloth which will be wrapped around your dead body will have no pockets.”So, I never thought of becoming rich in life. Literally I had zero desire towards money.Today!An incident at 2 am shook me away!!My mother asked me to wake up. She was tensed like hell.Me: Maa, what happened? (I was in shock)She: Your father is struggling to breathe.I ran towards my father. He was literally struggling to breathe and His heart was having a burning sensation.For a moment I was stunned and didn't know what to do?We decided to take him to the hospital. I took out my neighbors mobile number from my dad's phone. (I didn't bother to keep my neighbors number till that moment)I called my neighbor at 2:30 am.At 2:35 am, he came out of his home and he took out his car and waiting for us.Do you believe that? I've been living in this house for the last 6.5 years but have never spoke to my neighbor. Sadly yes, you should believe it.I spoke to him today for the first time in the span of 6.5 years.Somehow, my father felt quite at ease after sometime. So we dropped the plan of going to the hospital.My neighbor and his family came up to my house, as they were waiting outside in a car. They suggested some home remedies. My father felt ease after trying out the suggestion.I thanked my neighbors for coming up at the right time to help. My neighbors asked me to call at any moment, they will be there to help me.My father felt at ease and went to sleep at 3 am. Everything came back to normal, but not my mind.I couldn't sleep after that incident.That's when my life changed! I will explain you in detail in the last paragraph of this answer.A lot of thoughts going in my mind at that very short moment, when I saw my father struggling to breathe.I literally felt ashamed!Because, I was not in a position to say, “Doctor don't worry about money I need my father to get well soon”Yes! The last paragraph!!A very quick moment, never let me to sleep. I started to think of money. Yes! I need money and I want to become rich. Hell with peaceful life.I need to bid goodbye to this ordinary and simple lifestyle. A small moment changed my philosophy of life which I was following from 23.5 years.Sometimes, I used to question myself.“When people know that they will be going to die one or the other day. Why they are making money? Why they are going for higher packages despite getting a good Package in their old company.”But, today I got the answer.Life is a b*tch, it teaches the valuable lessons at the worst moments. I should stop being average. I need to earn more and live a comfortable life henceforth.People change because of their circumstances and situations. People grow from their pains. People learn from their pains. People attain maturity from the worst phases they have undergone.Let me change my life to a better one. Let me take my life quite seriously. Let me get settled down soon. Let me stop all my bad habits.Everything happens for the best, because it teaches you the lesson for your improvement.Sayonara!!(Your little appreciation and honest feedback makes me write even more.

The men of the tribe go out, hunt down an animal, kill it, and then they spend a few hours cleaning the animal and cooking it while everyone gathers around to be social as the sun sets and everyone gets ready to sleep. This was a great improvement on life before, where meat was eaten raw and could lead to disease and parasites. Cooking let our ancestors eat meat that was safer and more easily digested, and we discovered smoking which let us keep food longer. So did we improve on fire? You bet we did.It took a while but eventually we discovered the cob oven, which used mud to help contain the heat and, by extension, use less fuel to do more cooking. It was this that helped early man start to take those strange grasses that grew up everywhere and someone figured out that you could grind those grasses up into a kind of cereal. That was good, but oh no, some wound up in some water and began to rot. That’s not good. We’d better throw it out but… oh it smells strange. Hmm. I’ll just do a quick taste test and… wow that’s good stuff.It’s no surprise that beer and bread have been around a long time. Yeast and fermentation together made a kind of high calorie drink that was served to workers on projects like the pyramids. It kept them going and got them a little bit tipsy, which is never a bad thing when working in the sun all day. Plus, alcohol could be used to make water safer to drink by killing off bacteria. So now you have easily digested foods, safer drinks, warmth, what else can we do with this fire stuff?Metals baby. Unlike stone and wood, metals are much more durable but are a huge pain to get out of the ground. Still, they were useful and made tools stronger and more durable, and were nice and shiny. People like shiny things. So now your ax or spear will retain its point better or, if it does get bent, can at least be mended instead of looking for a new rock or stick. It also has the added benefit of being fashioned into jewelry, art, and coins, making it great for trading.All of this of course led to civilization around the world. Some technologies are dangerous of course, but ultimately technology isn’t evil, it’s just a tool that has helped mankind prosper. The problems we face because of technology are radically different than a caveman, and the problems our children have will be different than ours. It’s how we use technology that is important, and if we hope to overcome problems, we need to explore options and see where we can find new tools built on the foundations of those that got us here in the first place.","5,085 followers",Bobby Tatro,2.7K,2.2K,45.6M,2018,https://www.quora.com/If-a-new-type-of-revolutionary-technology-that-completely-changes-human-life-positively-suddenly-comes-into-existence-the-very-next-day-what-do-you-think-it-would-or-should-be-Why-and-what-changes-would-it-makes-to

After working for 11 months there I saved all of my salaries and again took admission in BSc. Comp Science and studied just to clear my exams not to compete or anything. After two years in my undergrad, I got a little bit interested in coding and started learning that all by myself.I got so interested in coding that I used to code 12 hours a day, I started coding so much that my friends started to worry that I would fail the exams cause I was not studying as much as I should have, I used to eat, sleep rest, walk cause my body needed it not my mind. I was so interested in coding that I used to take showers and eat my lunch at 5 PM or 6 PM in the evening.But as exams started coming closer I split the time in 50–50 and learned coding for 6hours and studies around 4 hours. That hard work started changing my life and the results started coming out. The first thing that happened to me was I topped the entire class and immediately professors and faculty members of college started recognizing me. I become an immediate threat to other student and they got afraid that I would surpass them which I did anyway. I got PPOs from three MNC’s but still as I was interested in coding and I wanted to become a coder, not some support guy or trainee or something.While I was learning to code I built an android app put it on live and created my LinkedIn profile and applied for internships in few startups, still, I thought that I won’t be able to get a job cause my DS and Algorithms are not that strong so I chose to become an intern rather than becoming a full-time employee and I thought I would do masters after internship.Soon after my application I got a call from one startup and they hired me as aI was getting a pay raise every three months in my first company cause of my performance. Fast forward almost 4 years I am making a good amount of money to live a decent life and still considering higher education. I have bought Play station, I have two mac book pros, one iPhone one Note 10 I bought some expensive shoes which I dreamed of when I was in college. I have rented one apartment where I work as a freelance software engineer. Because of my job I have visited two countries already. Life has never been better than this to me.ME IN BANGKOKME IN VIETNAMSo realizing that education and hard work won’t go unnoticed totally changed my life.So if you are in high school or still in college and studying I would suggest you to explore all the horizons learn how to become an astronaut, IAS, engineer or CEO of google. Learn how to get scholarships, education loan and go for higher studies. Learn how to finance your education if your parents can not afford it. Get the highest degree in your field of study I guarantee you that your entire life would change.DO NOT DROP OUT OF COLLEGE OR TAKE EDUCATION LIGHTLY CAUSE YOU HAVE NO FREAKING IDEA HOW POWERFUL EDUCATION IS UNTIL YOU REALISE KEEP WORKING HARD AND STUDYING.Edit:-I recently moved to Taiwan for a few years.","11,495 followers",Virginia Kettles,32.9K,104,8.3M,2019,https://www.quora.com/If-a-new-type-of-revolutionary-technology-that-completely-changes-human-life-positively-suddenly-comes-into-existence-the-very-next-day-what-do-you-think-it-would-or-should-be-Why-and-what-changes-would-it-makes-to

Sleep 8 Hours a NightNo ‘ifs’, ‘and’s’, or ‘buts’, you must get 8 hours of HIGH quality sleep everynight if you want to have the best life possible.Sure, you might sacrifice a few hours of productivity, however, if you look at any credible study, the research clearly shows that (unless you have a rare DEC2 genetic mutation) you need 5 sleep cycles to perform at your best.Sleep cycles occur every 90 minutes and, since it takes the average person 20 minutes to fall asleep, going to bed 8 hours before you need to be awake is ideal for optimal performance.5 Sleep Cycles x 90 Minutes = 7.5 Hours + 20 Minutes to Fall Asleep = 7 Hours 50 Minutes + 10 Minute buffer = 8 hours2. Make Sure You Sleep WELLJust because you are sleeping 8 hours doesn’t mean that you are getting 8 hours of quality sleep.To ensure that you are maximizing your “Z’s” I suggest that you:3. Exercise DailyThis might seem a little cliche, but it’s the single most important habit to ensure a high quality of life.If I don’t exercise daily (typically by lifting weights, doing yoga, or riding my bike), I can tell.I’m tired, ornery, and generally a bastard to be around.You need to get exercise as frequently as possible.Your body evolved to move so MOVE baby MOVE!4. MeditateAgain, this is cliche but it works.Taking 10 minutes every morning to sit in silence and simply reconnect with my breath and body has done miracles for my quality of life.Meditation has been scientifically shown to reduce stress, promote empathy, spark creativity, and improve overall well being tremendously.5. LaughThis is a big one that people often forget about.Laughter truly is the best medicine and starting out your mornings with a short stand-up comedy or a few clips from a funny talk show can put you into a positive mood that will permeate the rest of your day.I recommend that you find 2–3 comedians that you really love and purchase all of their stand-ups.Then, when you are cooking breakfast, play the show in the background and let the laughter roll.Oh, speaking of breakfast6. Eat BreakfastSeriously, I know a lot of you are probably avid practitioners of Intermittent Fasting, and that’s great, but unless you are counting calories and know for a fact that you are still getting enough fuel despite your fasting, you need to eat breakfast.It will charge you up for the rest of the day and prevent early afternoon “Hangriness”.7. Get Out in Nature (Preferably Near a Large Body of Water)Getting out in nature has been shown time and time again to be a HUGE factor in a person’s overall happiness and well being.We’ve evolved over the past 6,000 years to be surrounded by nature, not concrete.Make it a priority to get out in nature for at least 30 minutes a day.You won’t regret it.8. Connect with Someone You Love Every DayThis is a simple habit that will instantly and dramatically improve your quality of life.Humans are inherently social creatures and, despite the massive technological advancements we’ve recently experienced, we are more disconnected and solitary than ever before.Everyday I challenge you to connect with someone you love.Whether you Skype your mom, sit down for coffee with your girlfriend, or go hang out with amigos at the bar, spend at least 10 hours a week really connecting with people that you care about.9. Express GratitudeEvery single day ask yourself the question, “What do I have to be grateful for?”If you answer that question each morning when you wake up and each night before you go to sleep, I promise your life will change forever.10. RelaxDo something fun everyday.Play guitar, play video games, read a good book, walk by the beach.Just do something that will make you happy and help you relax.Your mind, body, and spirit will thank you for it.Stay Grounded,Learn more about my work and mission by visiting my Quora profile",448 followers,Joey Carmello,20.9K,0,0,2020,https://www.quora.com/If-a-new-type-of-revolutionary-technology-that-completely-changes-human-life-positively-suddenly-comes-into-existence-the-very-next-day-what-do-you-think-it-would-or-should-be-Why-and-what-changes-would-it-makes-to

To say that my sexuality was confused and perverted is an understatement.  I am shamed by all that I partook in, both by force and experimentation.My dad was a drunk and whore, and my mom did all she could to keep the house running and the two of us cared for.Coming from that background, I was that kid in school that everybody ignored, nobody picked for the sport teams.  The one who got ridiculed and insulted.    The only friend I had until I was 15 was the one whose older brother was raping me. Yes, raping.I still remember how I dreamed of being a serial killer, and had sadistic sexual fantasies.   I had so much rage and anger in me it was unbelievable.  I only got into 2 fights, and was so vicious that I sent the boys into ICU.  But, it was self defense in both cases, and there was multiple guys in each so nothing happen.  But, it just settled me into nobody wanted to be near me.I hated everybody and was a major fan of anybody who would kill.  Nobody, not even my parents knew of this.  I wanted to find a career that would put me around the country without being tracked (think truck driver) so that I could see how many I could kill without being caught.  At 12, I was forced as a ride along with a sheriff officer, and what he told my parents afterwards was that I scared him and I was going to be trouble.I was suicidal.  There was a few times that I attempted it, but by miracle, none were successful.  I have no idea of how God kept me alive, or how it can be explained without Him.  There were times that it was amazing, and times that fear stopped me,  sometimes it is simple explanations.  I have, and still do feel that death is relief, I just know it can not be at my hand.  I do not discuss these with anybody, lest my wife should know.   Its not something that I want her to be burdened with.When I was 15, my school had a religion critiquing class.  I attended, expecting it to be fun to tear apart beliefs.   One time, we had a field trip to a crusade, kind of like a pre-runner to the ""Harvest Crusades"" that Greg Laurie does.   There was an Alter call at the end of it.  I went forward and accepted Christ into my life.That was the start of an amazing adventure.  The greatest thing was that for the next 3 days, I felt this unbeatable feeling.   Like nothing could ever hurt me again.  And, for the first time in my life, I knew Love.  My mom loved me, but I just never knew what Love felt like.  During those 3 days, I learned it.The first change was amazing.   My sexual preferences turned to totally, 100% age appropriate heterosexual.   To this day, I still struggle with an addiction to Porn, but immediately, I only wanted a female that was around my age.  And, I did not want to hurt her, and no weird fetishes.  That was the first 3 days.I realized later, I did not want to hurt anybody any  more.  I had lost my desire to be a serial killer.  I had empathy, something that I never knew I was missing.  I was the one defending others, and proved I was willing to die to do it.Since then, I have assisted more than a dozen children who needed help, by putting everything I had on the line for them.  They know what I mean.  I have been faithful to my wife for almost 40 years now, when before I had valued sexual affairs as being the highest honor a man could have (thanks dad).Material goods mean very little to me, I have learned contentment.  I still recall thinking that ""here"" was a bad place to be, I had to keep changing, keep altering things.I was a wall flower who used to think of murder.  Now I am an extrovert who protects others regardless of the cost to  me.   I did get the truck driving job, but instead of killing, i have traveled the country helping and protecting without being known in so many instances.I never wanted to trust, never wanted to be near people.  Now, I can not imagine life without my wife.   I miss my friends at church during the week.  Its amazing how much I have changed.Sorry for the long answer, but this is something I have not opened about before, and its finally time to give all credit to Jesus, my love, my Lord, my King.Thank you for reading, Dave.","135,547 followers",Hector Quintanilla,19.6K,1.2K,88.6M,2020,https://www.quora.com/If-a-new-type-of-revolutionary-technology-that-completely-changes-human-life-positively-suddenly-comes-into-existence-the-very-next-day-what-do-you-think-it-would-or-should-be-Why-and-what-changes-would-it-makes-to

Just about every device relied on cogs and wheels, and almost everything that required brute power was run off steam. Although these machines can appear complex, it’s only because all their inner workings were exposed. There was no hidden stuff, as there is now in modern devices:Any technically minded person could figure out how a device like the time switch shown above worked, and what it was designed to do, just by studying it.During this period, reciprocating steam engines reached the highest point of evolution in design and efficiency, with the triple and quadruple expansion engines, and yet, the technology was still relatively simple. They were used to power the world’s fastest ocean liners of the 1890s, Like theIn the UK, the railway system was more extensive that it is today, a vast infrastructure connecting some surprisingly remote places. In the UK, the telegraph system was so well established that it was possible to send a telegram from any address in London to any address in Bombay within 40 minutes. So the Victorian’s, in a sense, had their own Internet too, albeit a very simple one. This meant news could be “wired” around the world.The Victorians put a lot of thought into the aesthetic appearance of their engineering projects, from simple desktop devices to largest bridges and stationary engines. All were heavily embellished with eclectic historical styles. This is a photograph of a water pumping station, at Crossness, England:Devices such as this barograph shown below were in widespread use during the period. I remember seeing similar devices as a child, installed in libraries and museums, used to keep track of temperature and humidity. This one records air pressure:Quite beautiful. Now they’ve mostly be replaced by digital systems.What makes this period especially fun is that electricity was around, but still in its infancy. Electric motors and generators were established, and the electric light was established, but that’s about it. There were no “electronics”nor any anything approaching the complexity of even a radio. So we could have electric fans, electric elevators and even electric trams, but no television, radio or computers. Anyone with a basic understanding of electricity from school today could understand an electric machine built in this period.This images shows two steam powered electrical generators:And a switchboard for such a system was just that—a board with switches!And for a bigger system:Please note that I am answering this from a technological point of view, not a social one. In that sense, I think the Victorian’s had an almost the perfect balance between nature, art and functional machines. There were problems though, such as health, safety and pollution, which were the unforeseen consequences of it all back then.Incidently, regarding computers, the Victorians could have had those too, as Charles Babbage had already designed a programmable, Turing-complete computer, using completely mechanical parts. Cogs and wheels. It was never built in the day, because it would have been ridiculously expensive and they just didn’t see the need for it at the time.","1,051 followers",Lynna Pinse,5K,209,3.2M,2022,https://www.quora.com/I-am-28-years-old-What-are-the-significant-and-revolutionary-technological-advancement-and-implementations-I-would-be-able-to-see-in-my-lifetime

It was bad enough that I was already poor, on welfare and housing assistance. But when all that misery combined with alcohol, my situation made me feel even more hopeless. And I was ready to let go.But life turned into a blessing on that fateful(SOOOO EMBARRASSING!)I started to walk out after my purchase when I decided to buy a NY Daily News. But it’s too early. No daily news, only The NY Times. So I grabbed one, handed over my $1.50 and walked out.I immediately went to the help wanted ads when I got back in my apartment. And there it was. The biggest help wanted add on the page.$12 - $18 per hour.For one day only 9AM-12PM. on that following Monday.Doors close promptly at 12.I was twenty-four years old and never came close to earning $5 per hour.I woke up early that Monday morning. And gave myself two hours to get there for a trip that takes about one hour. I put on my Sunday best, grabbed some résumés and started my trip to the JFK Hilton.I arrived and found the conference room and it was barren. There were only about fifty people in the conference room. It didn’t feel like a job fair. I almost turned around because I thought I was in the wrong place.We were called in the order that we signed in. I watched as some people left after the short interview and some sat back down. I was one of the people that was told to sit back down after my interview.Round two came as fast as round one. This company has this job fair thing down to a science. I’m called back up to the table by Mrs. Alexander. I will never forget her. She hands me a drug test cup and says follow me. A drug test! at a job fair. Probably the best way to weed out the druggies.After that, I fill out all my employment forms. And then she says. “let’s go over some things while we wait for your results. Because of your experience and interests I have decided to hire you as a motor pool mechanic. This is your rate of pay, you will be on 90 days probation with random drug testing, report to this man at this location this time next Monday. Now read and sign your code of ethics booklet.”(And with the most beautiful motherly I understand what you have been going through smile) Mrs. Alexander says “Congratulations Gerry and fix your tie.”I’M HIRED! The whole process took all of 40 minutes. I went from $4.35 per hour. To $16.52 in 40 minutes. I walked out of that Hilton with tears in my eyes.It only gets better from there. I start work and immediately fall in love with the company, the work hours, the people, and of course the pay. Life got good and was only going to get better.I get great advice from an older worker. One can go anywhere in this company. Just get your Qualies (Qualifications) for everything, go to class for everything, read and study everything and then get your ass out of the motor pool.So I did just that. I went from repairing company vehicles at the motor pool, to lineman electrician, and now my present position as a locomotive engineer earning six figures. Six figures with a high school degree and a technical school certificate. And I can honestly say that I do not mind paying taxes at the end of every year.Being poor and uneducated gave me serious depression.

Aap kisi aise ko de dena jisko iski zarurat ho.(Sir, so what if it's just a penny, someone has worked hard for it. Give it to someone who is in need.)I was astounded after listening that. All I could do was hug him as he refused my offer for water.People like Anil work so damn hard just for 15,000 ₹ (maximum) delivering more than 60 packages a day with very less incentives.Taking an average of 50 packages a day with an estimation of 2 ₹ as a tip, they could get 100 ₹ as a tip for the day.After a week or two I saw him delivering few packages in my campus. We talked and he told me he got a raise as he was most consistent in his work compared to others.What he taught me?What I learned from him ?",44 followers,Swati Trivedi,7.3K,71,1.5M,2018,https://www.quora.com/I-am-28-years-old-What-are-the-significant-and-revolutionary-technological-advancement-and-implementations-I-would-be-able-to-see-in-my-lifetime

These items will get here before Christmas. I have a surprise for everyoneI purchased everything.A couple of days later she got everything.I saw her then wrapping all her gifts.“Can I help you?”“No, Dad. I told you these are special surprises. Absolutely no peeking!”Her excitement was visible. She was proud. She was alive. She was glowing with happiness.The day came. She couldn't contain herself. She was all over her gifts, planning, protecting, arranging. Everything had to be perfect.As soon as dinner was over, she jumped up from her chair and took her gifts. She went around, giving each one of us her piece of love. These were small value items, but it was the meaning of her giving heart that we were really feeling.As she gave to each person, she paused. She watched the expression on our faces.Her last gift was for my back then 2-year-old boy: A rocking pony ride-on toy.It’s hard to describe the explosion of delight that my little boy had on his face when he got this gift!For several minutes, everyone was totally absorbed, our attention taken up watching him go all around the house making it a rodeo arena. Even though the pony is designed to be a static rocking horse — his excitement was so significant that the horse slid a few inches forward or backward with every thrust he exerted into the little toy.My little girl watched, rewarded with a huge smile on her face.Somehow, witnessing these acts of giving love from my 11-year-old helped me understand the power of giving.Later that day, my girl received some gifts, but she didn't need them.

Their face would break into a smile, and we’d share this moment of electric joy that would never have happened between two strangers otherwise.It was amazing.They walked away with a little extra bounce in their step.And so did I.Who knows what such ripples of happiness can create?I realized that we’ve got a chronic deficit of kindness.And that working on it one high five a time—Is not a bad way of tipping the scales.","12,664 followers",Johnny Reinsch,25.3K,82,3.8M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Which-is-more-of-a-revolutionary-technology-the-printing-press-or-social-media
