That means using significantly more fuel on every flight. Fuel already accounts for more than 50% of an airlines operating costs. Do you think airlines and their passengers are willing to pay even more than they already do when flying is safer than driving or even crossing the road?2) It's not clear this would actually save lives in the real world. Aviation incidents are extremely rare, and in the vast majority of ""reportable incidents"" no one gets hurt or killed (but that's not very 'interesting' so it doesn't get on the evening news).3) This tech actually adds a lot of ways for something bad to happen! What if a compartment is 1/2 ejected (part of the connection to the main aircraft fails or fails to release), what if the air seal between this section and the main aircraft fails, etc... You're almost certainly adding more danger than you're eliminating here.4) AsIn short, we manage risk in the real world. Nothing is ever perfectly safe because perfectly safe is virtually unusable.

The overall figure for all jet commercial operation in that time is 72 accidents resulting in fatalities.The next two categories account for fatalities totalling 1546 people in the aircraft and 29 on the ground in 32 accidents. The first category is controlled flight into terrain (CFIT) and the second is Runway Excursion on landing (RE). In neither of these scenarios would the cabin be of any use at all.CFIT is often in bad weather or darkness and as far as the crew are concerned the  flight is operating normally. Ground proximity warning would alert them prior to impact but at his stage the aircraft would be too low to jettison the cabin.RE means they are already on the ground, have either missed the runway or departed from the runway in someway such as overshooting. As the aircraft is already on the ground jettisoning the cabin is pointless.Of the remaining 744 onboard fatalities, perhaps 154 may have been saved as these were a result of mid air collisions or near collisions in 2 incidents.The figures quoted are for all fatalities. As others have pointed out, the two guys at the pointy end (pilots) would be left to their own fate with this invention.

With two separate structures, the mechanisms to hold them together, and the parachutes and the air/flotation bags, this isn't going to be a light weight piece of kit. Certainly the parachutes shown in the video are too small to provide a low rate of descent. They are going to need to be bigger, and bigger is heavier. Every kilo of weight added is going to come out of useful load. In this case useful load means passengers...the people who will be paying for it.Which leads me to the question of cost. They say 15% more/ticket. Again, I'd like to see some hard calculations on that. Remember that you have to start with designing, developing, and certifying a clean sheet aircraft design with a feature that regulatory bodies have no experience with. More than one company has gone bankrupt trying to do just one part of that. Then you have to get the airlines to buy them.Speaking of cost, there is the question of value for money. Despite what is shown in the video (and the statistics for percentage of accidents occurring in different stages of flight are very suspect) the fact is airline flying, particularly in North America and Europe, is astoundingly, incredibly safe. So safe that some people are almost incredulous, thinking ""we've been lucky"" or ""we're due for an accident"". The places where airlines aren't so safe are the places where standards of training and performance are not as high (and where they are generally using older airplanes, not something brand new). Clearly many of the problems of flying can, and have been, dealt with through training and hard work on safety.That leads to the question of who is going to build these airplanes? They appear to have used the the BAe 146/Avro RJ as the general model for the aircraft in the video (with a smaller number of engines). The key feature of this aircraft is its high wing with an underslung fuselage. Now tell me how many high wing airliners are in production today. (I'm pretty sure the answer is 1...the Bombardier Q400.) It's not a common configuration so this will require asking all manufacturers of airliners to completely change their design philosophy. Certainly attaching or jettisoning a passenger pod gets a good deal more complicated if that pod sits atop the main fuselage and wing structure.I suppose you could start an entirely new aircraft company but the business landscape is littered with failed attempts to build even small airplanes. Right now the airline industry keeps two large and two smaller companies afloat...Boeing and Airbus, and Bombardier and Embraer. Most of these have received some form of government support at one time or another...some of them a lot of support. Is there really room for a fifth manufacturer?It's not absolutely clear from the video but it appears this system is also intended to be used to load and unload passengers. That means the pod will need a seperate power source for heating, cooling and light. There's that nasty weight problem again. It also means airports would have to create entirely new infrastructure to accommodate these airplanes. If the pod was attached to the airplane in such a way as to only be detached in an emergency, like an ejection seat, this might have been more credible, but only a little.Lastly, you'll notice that the cockpit remains attached to the airplane as it plummets to the ground and explodes in a ball of flame in the background as the passenger pod descends gently in the foreground. This seems like it's a bit harsh on the flight crew.TL/DR?","26,857 followers",Lee Ballentine,4.4K,15.7K,52.8M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-most-interesting-emerging-technologies-in-biomedicine

13,"Prologue:Edit:Prologue:Edit:Beginning of the original answer:Accordingly, to our best theory, then, gravity is not a “force of attraction” existing between objects but rather, according to the wildly successful theory of General Relativity, a deformation or curvature of Space-time, itself. So, allow me then to explain how this works:In the image below, notice how the smaller object is traveling in a straight line from its own perspective—wait, whaaat? (yes this is strange but true as I will illustrate below) but appears from the perspective of the larger object (and our own) to be in orbit around it simply because of the curvature of space-time, i.e. the deformation of the surrounding space-time by the larger object. If you look closely you will see the smaller object also deforms space-time around itself, however, the degree of deformation depends on the relative mass of the objects in question, which in this illustration is represented by their relative size, as if both objects were made out of the same stuff. The degree of deformation actually depends on the mass of the object and not its size.Gravity then is an effect that mass has on the warping of Space-Time. It essentially makesIn the same way, if we project a straight line of an airplane flight following the curvature of the earth onto a flat map it appears to be curved, as is represented in the next illustration. This is called the “great circle” distance as geometrically it can be represented (when we dissect through the center of the Earth) to be circular on a flat plane. Great circle routes are a particular type ofSo what we learn from this is that whether a line appears to be straight or curved depends solely upon the geometry of the surface that line has been drawn on. . . . Earlier I mentioned that the smaller object was traveling in a straight line from its own perspective (of course from our perspective it lookedIf space were to be flattened out in the first image (much like it has been in the second image) then we can imagine the smaller object (still moving in a straight line) traveling away from the larger object exactly because there is no force of attraction acting between them, as illustrated in this next image.The effect of gravity travels at the same speed as light, and so if the mass of the Sun disappeared all of a sudden (along with the curvature of space-time it produces) then it would take 8 minutes and 20 seconds before the effect of the Sun’s disappearance was felt on our planet, which would then “fly off” in a straight line (because again from the planet’s perspective it had been traveling in a straight line the whole time anyway, except that it had been traveling in a deformed space-time which would have now become flat.)End of the Original answer.What follows constitutes a postscript prompted by all the feedback—much of truly wonderful—this answer has received in the comments.Edit:Allow me a slight tangent (and excuse that math pun), through a cognitive theory calledMathematics then allows us to describe metaphorically models of nature such as General Relativity. In other words, such a theory can be thought to be a metaphorical model that has been described rigorously and shown to be consistent (and also is predictive which the scientific part of it). However, there is no way to transfer the mathematical metaphor into metaphors of natural language and be able to hold on to that consistency. It just can’t be done, which is why it is necessary that in order to really understand the theory fully one must understand the theory mathematically. But if the question presupposed being able to do that then one could just googleMy hope here was to answer the question that left people with an intuitive sense for a very unintuitive idea about how the world works. The takeaway point needs only be that to the best of our current understanding gravity is not a force of attraction between objects but rather a curving of space (by which I really mean, you guessed it space-time) that causes objects moving through space (and time) to be “smashed” together, in the sense that your butt is being smashed against something if you happen to be sitting at the moment you’re reading this.I do, however, have another metaphor to help. Consider the following illustration:Imagine this big yellow guy spinning around, creating a centripetal force on these other two guys. What keeps the other guys from flying off into space is the felt “force of attraction” created by the rope (you could even imagine it having elastic properties). This rope then acts just like the force of gravity.Now one, last illustration :)If this rope were to snap then we have a situation that is identical to one illustrated in the third illustration. This shows that whether we think of gravity as a force like a rope or as the curvature of space, the same behavior is being described. So, practically speaking, any effect that can be described by gravity as a force can also (more or less) be described by gravity as the curving of space. It might not be so intuitive to think of “walking off a roof” and falling to the ground as a product of the curvature of space, as one comment to my answer put it,Edit:Based on some of the comments, and against my better judgment, I am going to attempt to provide some information about the mathematics involved. There is an adage in the publishing industry that for every mathematical equation you include you will lose so many readers. I suppose if someone really had a sense of humor they would present that statement as a mathematical equation :)Speaking of humor, this seems like a good time for a math joke:A mathematician and his best friend, an engineer, attend a public lecture on geometry in thirteen-dimensional space.""How did you like it?"" the mathematician wants to know after the talk.""My head's spinning"", the engineer confesses. ""How can you develop any intuition for thirteen-dimensional space?""""Well, it's not even difficult. All I do is visualize the situation in arbitrary N-dimensional space and then set N = 13.""So at the risk of undoing everything I’ve attempted above, we need to talk about the mathematical geniusHere is a video that covers some of the previous territory we’ve traversed and gets us a little farther still.One thing I’ve come to realize about my answer is that although I kept stressing Space-time if you didn’t already know what I was talking about then the reason for this probably was being lost.Well, the reason as I’ve suggested is that we can use Reinmann’s insight to describe 3-d curvature in 4-d Space-time. Here is a video that gives you some sense of how the mathematics work.Now one last video that is really neat and hopefully will bring this all back into the realm of one’s non-mathematical intuition. This last video also brings us back to the first illustration in my answer, which is a nice symmetry, except now it isn’t simply a 2-d illustration of a 4-d event but rather one that while still limited gives you a much better intuition of what the deformation of space-time really means. Note especially how he gets a secondary orbit when two marbles are thrown together, around the 4:30 mark, because that’s really just awesome—and so it is a great way to end on the awesomeness of the picture of the universe in which theBonus video:Why a Riemann surface, essentially the mathematical model of the 4-dimensions of Space-time, is impossible to represent in 3-dimensions (for those who keep asking for a more clear concrete analogy in natural language for the shape of Space-time). I am sorry but the theory we have for “how gravity is produced” can finally only be fully grasped in its mathematical expression. As you’ll see in the below video a 4-dimensional space is easily described with mathematics even if it’s impossible to truly ever visualize:And so here is one last thing to consider maybe the reason that Algebra is completely described only when using complex numbers in the 4-dimensions of complex functions is exactly because this is how the world really exists (or least the part of it dealing with our common experience) which seems to be the only part where gravity is actually important. At any rate, complex functions and the associated math resulting from them is enough to describe the geometry of 4-d Space-time and explain gravity as the deformation of this Space-time.",259 followers,Ritesh Kumar Mishra,1K,2.3K,33.4M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-most-interesting-emerging-technologies-in-biomedicine
