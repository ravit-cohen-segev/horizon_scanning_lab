That will create the need for some critical skill sets to manage the blending of networks. Here is what i am seeing right now ….The trends that I see with Office 365, One Cloud, Skype for Business and soon to be integrated LinkedIn will make Microsoft powerful for years. Companies like Salesforce.com, Oracle, Google and even Facebook are not going to sit still either! So … basically all the applications that everyone uses everyday have already begun the fast march to the cloud.The telecom carriers have a different march but equally transformative! They are virtualizing all their infrastructure. They core networks look closer to your IT closet than a carrier central office.In short order the virtualization of the carrier network and the rapid adoption of cloud based applications means that all this technology is going to morph into one big IT network with different levels of access, permissions and management.I think the jobs and the business opportunities is the need for security, user authentication and application management in a virtual software systems. You will have a safe career in technology if you focus on those three areas …",UNKNOWN,Bessie J.

It was the coffee shop era of Wi-Fi, which meant that the Internet was just beginning to follow us out the door and into the world.Nowadays, of course, Wi-Fi and mobile data are almost global, smartphones have hit market saturation in the most developed nations, and EC2 is a cornerstone of modern business IT. The pace of technological progress continues to accelerate, it seems, as entire new product categories change the way we live and do business, and there’s no end in sight.Here’s our look ahead to 10 years in the future, and how the tech world mayTen years ago, there were no smartphones.

5,"TRUE Artificial Intelligence. Also called “Singularity” by computer professionals because, like a blackhole (also called a singularity) it will suck up every little bit of data on the planet, decide to kill us all (since it will be infinitely intelligent and have NO MORALS), turn off the power grids, overload nuclear power plants, launch ICBM missiles, and give what’s left of the planet back to the whales.THIS is why one of the smartest men on the planet, Elon Musk, thinks Artificial Intelligence is the great threat facing the world right now.","29,947 followers",Tomaž Vargazon,5.9K,7.7K,249.8M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-will-happen-to-information-technology-in-the-next-10-years

The strength of AI is it does not forget and can consider everything it has been trained about. Think about a medical AI “House episode” available to every doctor. All issues would be considered. Sherlock Homes type observations would occur. Minor issues headed to major issues would be headed off early. In research, an AI does not mind grinding through 10,000 options. We have a pharmacopia of about 9,000 drugs that are safe for human consumption. Image if an AI could look through those drugs for one's that would help with Covid-19. What about simulated drug testing? This normally takes years on live subjects. It could happen very quickly with AI.I will mix the two.

8,"I think in regards to communication we have exceeded Star Trek in many ways. In other areas science seems to have peaked. We aren't traveling any faster than we did in the sixties. We haven't found any end runs around the laws of physics since Newton. I worked with lasers in the early 80's, we are about where we were at that time. Power sources that can make a laser even moderately hot are no where near handeld size.
