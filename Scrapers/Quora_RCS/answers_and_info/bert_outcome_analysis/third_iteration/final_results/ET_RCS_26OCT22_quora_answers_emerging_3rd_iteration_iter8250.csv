One flick and he’s gone.Cyborg is next to die.Soon as he fires a shot at Thor, Thor will laugh and then he gets Thanosed.Now of course to the main people you’ve been waiting for.A major misleader in the Flash argument of of course is this scene:While this is my favorite scene in the entire DCEU after the Warehouse scene, this was Flash doing what he promised not to do. The important part is that in fights 99% of the time he will move at his typical Mach 50–100+ speed and he can be kept up with and tagged.While Thor is not as purely fast as Flash, he has reacted to Quicksilver who is fasterAnd has traveled lots of miles in secondsFact of the matter is that if Flash gets touched-just like Batman and Cyborg, he’s dead. It’ll be hard, but Thor will get him and Flash isn’t doing anything to Thor. He has no feats to show he can even hurt him.Now for the big three that can actually hurt Thor.Here’s where we bring in Stormbreaker.Stormbreaker beheaded Thanos with ease.Thanos is by far more durable than any other character in the DCEU.Stormbreaker overpowered the entire Infinity Gauntlet BlastThis would have killed Thanos if he aimed for the head.Wonder Woman is vulnerable to sharp objectsSo is AquamanThor lands a Stormbreaker hit and they’re dead.Aquaman might be able to do some good work though before he eventually dies.If it was just these 5 characters, I would give Thor the win about 8.5–9/10.But there’s a big blue boy scout to overcomplicate everything.Superman would be the front assault on Thor. His punches would hurt Thor.But Thor’s would hurt a whoooooooole lot moreThor’s lightning would spell death for anyone on the Justice League.And then there’s the axeSo to be honest, I came into this thinking the Justice league would win like 7–8/10. But as I’ve been writing? Only threats are Superman, Wonder Woman, and Aquaman. Two of which, will not survive any semi-major hit from Thor and one who will give Thor much trouble but will still die if Thor focuses on him.So who do I give the win to?THOR TAKES THIS 6/10!!!!!!!","3,452 followers",Olisa Efobi,1.9K,838,25.3M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Could-the-MCU-Thor-or-Comic-Book-Thor-beat-the-DCEU-Justice-League

You also notice that when your parents ask you to do chores, you go off with the intent to do them and then find yourself sitting on your closet floor two hours later reading a book. But whatever, chores are boring and you’re like, 8 years old. That’s normal.It’s middle school. Suddenly, you’re starting to learn some actual information. It still comes easily, for the most part, but you’re having trouble paying attention in class and you can’t exactly learn something you don’t hear. You also realize you might need to start studying. You read the introduction to the textbook, because that’s what kids on TV do to study, right? They read textbooks.It’s high school, and you’re failing. You don’t understand what’s happening. You’re unable to listen in class, you’re unable to study, you have no control. You’re lost, and all of the adults around you are angry because you’re not doing your best. Not living up to your potential. You get angry at yourself too. You’re smart. You know you’re smart. So why do you feel so stupid?Halfway through high school you reach a breaking point. You have a complete mental breakdown staring at a blank essay that was due last week and beg your mother to send you to a psychiatrist. You know that the amount of trouble you have is abnormal. There’s something wrong with you.You get diagnosed with ADD. The psychiatrist confirms you have a genius level IQ as well, and explains that it’s extremely rare for someone with that level of intelligence to not have some sort of learning disability. You’re relieved that you have the answer to your problem, and that things will be okay now. As soon as you start medication.You start your medication and classrooms become a different world. You can listen! Pay attention! You hear everything the teacher is saying, and actually remember what was talked about after the period ends! But then you realize that the content is harder than what you’ve learned before. You’ll actually need to study to do well in these classes. Sounds easy enough, right? Until you realize that you’ve never had to study. In elementary and middle school when people were developing study skills you were cruising by without a second thought. You have no learning skills. You need to develop them, but it’s already grade 11. You don’t have time! Your second semester marks are being sent to university, how are you supposed to get the grades you need when you can’t study?You manage to develop study skills. You work your ass off and force yourself to learn years of behaviour in a few months. You’re constantly stressed and crying. You get into your program of choice, but you aren’t sure if it can be attributed to your hard work or simply being lucky enough to be born with high intelligence. Around the same time you’re diagnosed with depression and mild OCD. Your doctor tells you it’s extremely common in people with high IQ’s, much like the learning disability that stole half your education.You’re fucking bitter. You have a learning disability, multiple mental illnesses, and you don’t know basic math seeing as you didn’t start learning in school until grade 11. And you’re still having to work as hard as anybody else for good marks. Your high IQ is a fucking burden.I haven’t even started on the social issues that come with a high intelligence, either. It’s incredible how having a high IQ can actually make you sound like the dumbest person alive when talking to people out loud. Breathtaking irony there, folks.I’m killer at logic puzzles, though.

At least that was the result of the test I took when I tried to join Mensa. Puts me at +4SD, roughly one in sixteen thousand.And for the longest time, I let that get to my head.

There are so many people out there like me, so many that the world doesn’t even know what the fuck to do with us; so many that the world doesn’t even care about us enlarge.It took one night to take all the pride I had in my IQ and place it into achievements that I’m trying to work towards. I’m glad I had that epiphany young - not everyone gets that lucky.Now onto the juicy bit, what you’re reading this question to find out: what is it like? Well really you already know - I’m joining a party that started in 2019. I’m here to offer a bit of contrast to the people I’ve seen.There is nothing inherently bad about having a high-IQ.Yeah, I just wrote that. I sound like an arrogant piece of shit now, huh? Well, previously I said contrast, and I’m trying to deliver.School is easy. I’ve missed more than 50% of all my classes this year because they’re boring. I am a horrible student. I haven’t done a homework assignment all year(until the quarantine hit). I “study” for 30mins a day, two days before my exams, ace the tests, and have around an 80% average. It feels like you can do everything normal people can do in 1/10th the time.What part of that segment sounded bad to you?Everyone above a +2SD might have a similar story to a varying degree. That begs the question, why are so many people saying they’d rather not have a high IQ?It’s is an absolute gift. If you’re one of the few in this world that have been gifted, be grateful. If you’re not, work hard enough so that you can laugh at the high-IQ kids who made it their identity when you get to the top.Understanding concepts quickly does not mean understanding concepts immediately.There’s a good chance you read that and went “lmfao what?” Let me explain.It’s common knowledge that IQ tests how quick you are to grasp things, that you make connections better than most and you make them faster. When I found out I had an IQ of 160, I thought that meant I was supposed to be like the geniuses in the movies - no struggle, not behind intellectually whatsoever. That meant that I should be able to understand the mathematics behind quantum mechanics and chaos theory despite being a rather unaccomplished senior in high-school. I don’t understand those concepts, not even a little bit. I try to a little bit more every day, but I know for a fact that everyone who actually understood it would laugh at me if I said I was their equal. I am an idiot when compared to academics.We still have things we don’t understand or are too complex to understand in the given time frame. If you meet someone and they tell you “yeah, general relativity was just something I understood immediately.” They’re either fucking lying, or they have a spectacular case of the Dunning-Kruger effect and you should probably document it.You do not get a special “social outcast” pass if you have a high IQ.There’s a phrase I like to live by, “If nobody can relate to you, you have bad social skills.” This is true regardless of if your IQ is 50 or 150. It doesn’t matter if you relate to them, it matters if they can relate to you. As you may have heard from the other posts on here, you’re often not very interested in these people. When I was a kid, I referred to most other people as “not even human.” Don’t I sound like a lovely person to be around?You can talk to normal people and have normal conversations just as easily as everyone else. Not being able to have a normal conversation is not some kind of quirky side effect of having a high IQ, it’s you being a fucking moron and refusing to dial down your pride.There’s a little paradox here that you may have caught - if high IQ people can learn everything quickly, why can’t they learn the skill of being social?There’s no real answer to that. There are guides online, there are people that teach social skills, there are textbooks that outline human behavior everywhere. My guess is that they feel they have an excuse.This is something that’s a huge pet peeve of mine, and probably the main reason I will never go back to mensa. I don’t know how many times I’ve heard “normal people don’t understand me.” or some kind of derivation of that phrase. If they don’t understand you, you have not made yourself understandable, and you don’t know how to present yourself. If Bill Gates and Elon Musk can make themselves understood, you should be able to as well.",0 followers,Brett Tyler,4.5K,543,10.4M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Why-is-it-almost-impossible-to-create-a-practical-efficient-programmable-mechanical-computer-with-the-characteristics-of-a-modern-tablet-computer

So i placed my bag on a place that I have chosen, went to the toilet, and when i came back, a few of my classmates dragged my bag from the table to the floor as a signal that I am not welcomed there. Thinking back still hurts. Decent grades from year 1 to year 11, but I pretty much never touched a book until my form 6 ( British Education system ). Thinking back, i don’t know how i did this. Never studied, and yet my grades were better than most of the studious type.When i was 14, I volunteered to create an artwork for my school’s annual magazine cover. My tool of choice? Command line ray tracing. Can’t remember the name of that software. But it was like “rotate “add box ( x,y,z, add texture x,y,z, *.jpg colour #####, ) “. Learnt that software in less than a week and created an amazing artwork that defied believe at that time. Keep in mind this was still back in mid 199x where computer games had 8 bit graphics, 320x240 pixels and they required 10 floppy discs. PKUNZIP anybody? The artwork that i was talking about? 3000+ lines of code and took days to render on an old 486 PC.Later I realized that physics and maths came naturally to me and I got almost perfect grades in my sixth form. and was accepted to a leading university to study Mechanical Engineering.Graduated without much fuss. I was basically getting amazing grades without much studying. There was a course that I missed the mid term exams because i have simply forgotten about it. In the series Suits, the character Mike Ross has photographic memory. But he can’t remember some simple stuffs. Its something like that. That course that i missed the mid term ( 40% ) paper? I got a B-. Which means I scored nearly 100% in the finals. The name of the course? Advanced Mathematics.Upon graduation, went to join an oilfield service firm. Earned an extremely decent wage running equipment on drilling rig. High IQ solving problems but low EQ creating lots of friction with the people on the rig was pretty much the theme of my career. Typically spend 1% of my mental space to come up with a solution, but 99% of the time to convince others and answering stupid questions.Left the oilfield to join the office. Rose up the ranks initially because my high IQ was solving problems that nobody can solve. I was promoted to management rather quick and my career basically went to shit after that. Low EQ means managing people and navigating office politics were a real bitch. Unable to read subtle cues that the political landscape has changed during the oil industry downturn ( somewhere in 2014–2015 ), i stepped on too many toes, and was an outcast again. In an office where people were getting laid off, the fact that i made my colleagues look stupid easily meant I have a target on my back. Top management was ok with me because i solved many problems for them and I’m not on any list to be laid off, survived all the rounds. But i was alienated by my colleagues for several years and I fell into rather severe depression. It was high school all over again. I reached a point where i couldn’t take it anymore and volunteered for the package ( VSS package ), an almost unheard of move.3 years later. I am jobless, with a multi year gap in my resume. I’m unable to secure even an interview in 3 years because getting laid off carries a bad connotation that nobody wants to touch me with a 10 foot pole. My CV is filled with examples of how i saved customers money doing this and that, but the gap is all they see. I am officially unemployable.Why did I ask to be laid off? I realized it years later. With with high IQ, success after high school came too easily for me. As a result, I was unable to see how precious a career is. How difficult to build a career and reputation. It was all too easy and I threw it all away like a bag of trash.I would like to utilize my gift to be a productive member of the society. But low EQ and quirky behavior have made me an outcast most of my life and I’m unable to do much with my gift.

I was very proud of this as a little boy.At age 6, my mother brought me into the principal and the head priest of the church (I went to private school) because she was shocked that I had memorized the entire church service. I think she thought it was some kind of minor miracle lol.The principal and priest took turns reciting different parts of the mass to test me. I surprised them by responding, verbatim, every “call and response” portion of the exercise.(My mother and me, camping, 7 years old)Fast forward to 5th grade, my aptitude was tested again and school officials wanted to put me in either 7th or 8th grade. I was struggling with behavioral issues at the time. They concluded that I was “bored” and “mostly unchallenged” by the 5th grade curriculum.I refused the grade hop out of fear of getting beat-up by upper classmen. Not an entirely baseless sentiment, either.In hindsight, I’ve come to realize that I didn’t require much formal schooling past 4th grade. That may seem strange to some, but to me it was an epiphany of sorts. Explained a lot about my personal struggles.As an autodidact, I prefer learning things on my own, e.g. reading as a small child.By the time I was a teenager, I would skip school and go to the public library. It was the one place I knew school security wouldn’t come looking for me, plus, I got to read books on psychology, sociology, martial arts; therefore, I got to study the subjects that actually captured my attention.Then it was onto college. That was unfulfilling. I often studied at the red lights on the way to school. Only classes that gave me a challenge were business and finance.Was doing calculus level math on the college aptitude\placement test that I didn’t even understand. I barely did a couple months of algebra in high school.The test was challenging beyond my comprehension. I literally felt myself pushing the limits of what my brain was capable of. Still scored high enough for advanced math placement.I dropped out of college. Twice.That’s the short of it.So, what’s it like having a high IQ?It’s truly a mixed bag.Things can be predictable and boring. Even world events may playout as visualized.So much of what is “known” is not learned, though later confirmed through research. Logic, reason and a baseline of knowledge can be sufficient enough to understand most things. Inductive and deductive reasoning are frequently utilized tools in the toolbox. Reliably so…Fitting in can be challenging, sometimes. People don’t always take too kindly to people that are “always right” and that, “think that they’re so smart.” Especially the average Joe\Jill know-it-all, Dunning-Krueger types.I do best with open minded, intelligent people. Or the younger, eager to learn types. I also get along great with the 60+ crowd. PhD grads are almost always a delight.It’s 100% a breath of fresh air to sit down with someone that enjoys a meaningful discussion. The give and take of a constructive conversation can be, and often is, invigorating.In my lifetime pursuit of knowledge and living a meaningful life, I’ve discovered a deep love for the arts and the endless possibilities of expression. I believe that artists and creative types are the true geniuses. E.g. a film maker or storyteller with a bird’s eye view of the bigger picture.At the end of the day, I’m just a guy.I put on my pants one leg at a time like everyone else.I get sick. I laugh, I cry. Though it’s usually because I’m crying laughing.I’ve always wanted to be a philanthropist. Make the world a better place and all that.Having a high IQ, for me, is nice for the most part. Though I place far more value in someone with a good sense of humor, that’s kind, lighthearted and thoughtful.I would be okay with just that, no doubts there.Thanks for reading!🙂(The Milton-Bradley Memory game I played as a kid!)",105 followers,Tejan Ausland,924,0,0,2021,https://www.quora.com/Why-is-it-almost-impossible-to-create-a-practical-efficient-programmable-mechanical-computer-with-the-characteristics-of-a-modern-tablet-computer

I turned on the humility and let myself learn social skills, emotional skills, life skills from many wise people, regardless of their intelligence. It turns out that 10,000 hours, or 30 years, or however you measure, of experience in some aspect of life beats any IQ measurement hands down.The human brain is amazing not because of its raw processing power, but because of the depth and nuance it is capable of understanding over a lifetime of experiences.

12,"I have an IQ of 150+ and am about 40 years old.Having an extremely high IQ is strange. On the one hand, you are, by definition, extremely intellectually capable.

There’s no getting around it. People do not enjoy the company of people who make them feel like they have nothing original to share.It can be frightening. In an emergency, it is disturbing to realize that other people do not have the same mental facility that you do. For example, in a medical emergency, you’d like for your doctor to be as smart or smarter than yourself. If you have an extremely high IQ, that is unlikely to be the case.You spend a lot of time explaining. Related: People ask you lots of questions because they know that you’re more likely than anyone else to have or to be able to find the answer. Depending upon your personality, you may love or hate this.It is harder to find someone to marry. Most people like being married to an intellectual equal. You have fewer intellectual equals than the average person, so you will have to look harder.Unless you make a real effort to be approachable, a lot of people are going to be afraid of you. That’s not good. It’s especially important for someone with an extremely high IQ to try to communicate warmth and acceptance if he wants to get along with others.People expect you to go into certain professions and take certain educational paths. You may find it hard to separate their expectations from your own desires.Life is easier. It’s easier to make money, easy to plan, easy to reason through problems, etc. Can’t help but laugh at people who decry the “unmerited” advantages of being good-looking who don’t also say the same about IQ. It’s the luck of the draw, and if you happen to draw the high IQ card, you’re going to have an easier time. With one exception:School. Regular school is so boring that I find it hard to fully express how boring it is. Torture. Just horrible. Imagine if you were forced to listen to someone talk about the ABC song, or something similarly trivial, for hours every day for years, and you were expected to behave attentively and fill out pages and pages of mindless forms afterward. If you have a kid with an extremely high IQ, do not make their childhood like that! Graduation feels more like parole.Mostly, it’s great. You’ll never quite fit in, but that’s okay.

They're well adjusted and - if they're not into the high IQ myth - not wildly egotistical either.Of course this also means they're harder to spot.Being smart doesn't mean you will achieve great things but if you do there's often intelligence involved. Achievements outside of making money - inheriting wealth is easy and dumb people do it all the time - are one clue. The ability to learn and synthesize ideas is another. Most of all it's the ability to take leaps. Mozart, Einstein, Darwin, Picasso and Da Vinci were all - by any sane measure - extraordinarily intelligent. The only thing they have in common is that they pushed their fields into uncharted water.When smart people are frustrated it's often from the resistance that innovation meets. Very smart people who live comfortably within the status quo aren't as smart as they think they are. It's one reason I think so many brilliant business people drop out of university.EDIT: Note the names of people in this thread claiming super-genius IQ's and then try to recall any of the music they've written, devices they've invented or political parties they've led. If IQ is measuring intelligence what's going wrong here?

For reference, the WISC is not an IQ test per se, but it’s the closest we have that isn’t an informal online exam, which aren’t reliable and have a tendency to grossly overestimate.Preschool (age 2–5)I spent most of my time watching game shows, doing puzzles, and doing math workbooks — the onesGrade school (age 5–10)I struggled keeping friends. I didn’t share many interests with other kids my age. There were occasional things like video games or sports games that I could relate with other kids about. But once the topics moved on to things like toys or trucks or movies, it ended. IMiddle school (age 10–14)The struggles continued. I was the loner. I had interactions with kids, but they were just that: “interactions.” Other kids, I think, saw me more as a joke than as a person. I began having behavioral issues — not paying attention in class, challenging authority (“smart ass”), debating teachers, etc. And when the teachers couldn’t answer my questions, I devalued them.Although I was never bullied, kids that age like to shun anyone who is different in any sense, so I felt increasingly isolated. My parents got me into a program calledHigh school (age 14–16)This is when things started to slowly get better, mostly because it wasn’t middle school. I found a few science teachers that I really meshed with that kept me on my feet. One, in particular, knew I wanted to become a doctor and she became a sort of confidant for me. The material was a lot harder, so I had to pay attention and thus felt like I could relate to the people around me. I bounced around from clique to clique. I never developed any real deep friendships, but I at least had people I could talk to. I was also involved inCollege and med school (age 16–24)Things continued to get better. Although I was a bit socially delayed, I continued sharpening my skills in interacting with others. I was no longer necessarily the smartest one in the room, and I had my minor academic setbacks. On the one hand, it was hard to deal with those setbacks because I wasn’t used to any sort of academic struggle. On the other hand, it gave me some humility and some insight into relating to other people. I joined study groups, which was helpful to balance the social growth with the academic. And, at the advice of a friend, I joined a fraternity. Although I was definitely one of the more quiet guys, I finally had close friends for the first time in my life. Those guys really forced me out of my shell and helped me build confidence (whether that was their intent or not).In med school, I fit in fairly well. I wanted to be more popular and have more friends, but by this point my social issues primarily were due primarily to social anxiety rather than a lack of social skills at all. To whatever degree med school taught me how to interact with patients, it also helped me come off as somewhat relatable to other people (or at least put up that front).Adulthood (age 24+)Post-med school, things have gotten somewhat more difficult. Academia was always a respite for me. The environment was controlled, focused, and synthetic. Academia is not a cross-section of society, of course. So most of my struggles have continued to be in the communication department. I’ll often make jokes that people don’t get, go over their head, or are taken the wrong way, which can feed the social anxiety and set me back. Or I will, regretfully, come off as snobby and cold initially (in part from my history of social delay, but also in part from the social anxiety). When getting into friendly debates with others, I often get really frustrated when people aren’t using detached logic. And when they aren’t, I often assume it’s from being disingenuous. Basically, the difference between disingenuousness and unintentional ignorance is something I struggle sniffing out. When I’m in a mood, I usually assume the former. This has caused me to begin to have a cynical view of humanity. That’s something I see a therapist about.But I have close friends, and that’s all I’ve ever really wanted. Occasionally, they’re complicated by not picking up on certain social cues (e.g., when to joke, when to be serious). For sure, I’ve lost friends and even partners because of that. But I’ve learned to be up front early with my friends and tell them that I apologize in advance if I’m oblivious to certain things — that it’s not intentional. I’ve found that strategy has helped a good deal. People often have more patience than I might give them credit. When we find a common interest, like sports or politics, I do just fine socially. Paradoxically, I can be pretty insightful intoOut of necessity, I’ve learned to come across as warm and compassionate and communicative at work, which has helped me with superficial interactions with acquaintances outside of work. I still struggle with transitioning out of “work mode” (especially with colleagues off the clock). I also have to be mindful of not letting my conversations with friends devolve into philosophical/intellectual dialogues all the time. But I’m getting better at that. Along with many others, I also struggle with some residual perfectionism, but that’s also getting better.So yeah, that’s my story.","37,222 followers",Alexander Finnegan,6.6K,9K,100.2M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-is-it-like-to-have-an-extremely-high-IQ-2

There are very smart people squandering their abilities and a lot of dumb people doing well at life. Life doesn’t reward you according to what you deserve, but rather what you fight for. This revelation made me cynical for a while lolI notice how easily I can remember things most people cant. For example I taught myself how to trade just reading forums and looking at charts from other traders. I often ask myself, why cant everyone do this, it’s not that hard. The initial learning curve was a little challenging, but once I learned it, it’s like shooting fish in a barrel. I can recognize patterns other people miss or cant see, to me its very obvious. Earning a living without having to work for someone else is a perk. But I don’t think that has anything to do with IQ, I know very smart doctors who have been employed their entire lives. Being business save is an entirely different genius.I love carrying on conversations with pHD professors and look forward to seeing my dentist, just for the dialog lol Other smart people know when they’ve lost a debate and its apparent to both without having to say anything. Ive had conversations with individuals of inferior intellect and they often cant recognize when they’ve lost, I avoid having to talk to these types of people. Sadly thats a large portion of society.Ironically I never saw myself as very smart or genius. Being smart gives you the insight of realizing how little you actually know. It blows my mind the confidence of some people and how ignorant they really are. To be honest Im not sure Id want to be much smarter than this, its very isolating at times. It feels difficult to blend in, especially when conversations take a turn into trivial topics like local gossip or celebrity banter. I cant stand small talk and Ive had to teach myself the skill of communicating with people. How to survive conversations that I find pointless and down right offensive, for the lack of intellectual stimulation. I had to realize that expecting everyone I meet or every person I go on a date with to have these types of conversations is unrealistic.I think every smart person eventually has the revelation that goes something like, “wow most people out there really don’t have much going on upstairs.” It’s a sad and sobering realization, especially when you understand a lot of these people are in power play positions like politicians. You come to accept a lot of normal people think they're much smarter than what they are. You just learn to deal with it.I also believe in God and it brings me great comfort believing there is a supreme consciousness with an intelligence far beyond my capacity for understanding. Im glad Im not the smartest person in the universe and Its hard to understand how there is a being with that power and they don’t get bored. The coolest thing about a heaven is the idea that I get to spend an eternity learning, growing and trying new things without ever getting bored.

18,"Until my late teens, I was fairly sure that I was just “average”, which, in a family full of university professors and engineers, actually translates as “low”. At around 17–18 years of age I had become interested in IQs and intelligence, and was going through my old school documents from my childhood in the US and found records indicating a pretty high IQ (my brothers and sister all have gifted-range IQs, mine is at least some 10 points higher than theirs).When asking my parents about what I found in my records they told me that they had been informed by the school that I had the highest scoreUntil my late teens, I was fairly sure that I was just “average”, which, in a family full of university professors and engineers, actually translates as “low”. At around 17–18 years of age I had become interested in IQs and intelligence, and was going through my old school documents from my childhood in the US and found records indicating a pretty high IQ (my brothers and sister all have gifted-range IQs, mine is at least some 10 points higher than theirs).When asking my parents about what I found in my records they told me that they had been informed by the school that I had the highest score there. The school counselors were initially considering making me repeat a year because I was two years younger than my classmates and my grades were slipping, but, after testing, they concluded that I could be a further two years ahead. Given that result, they decided to keep me where I was and put on some extracurricular activities (violin, fencing) that would help me socially and intellectually (which seemed to work). However, they gave my parents stern warnings to never tell me of my high IQ, advice which they heeded until I confronted them.As a child in the US, I had some difficulty getting along with classmates, and suffered some bullying as well, something I thought had to do with me being Brazilian and younger than my classmates. Two years implies a huge size difference when you are a child, plus having far less experience (i.e., being more naive). However, my parents told me that I had also been harassed and even beaten up by kids who felt threatened by the fact that I was “upping the Bell Curve”. During recess, I had to wander around school grounds all by myself , because I really had no friends and had to avoid the bullies. I remember feeling painfully lonely.This isolation, together with some natural Introversion and a tendency for visual-spatial thinking, lead me to very a very eidetic imagination where I learned to “zone out” into my own mental world to the point of only “snapping out” when someone physically shook me (didn't answer to verbal calls). Indeed, I was known for making weird gestures in the air, interacting with the things I was imagining. This didn't make me very popular with teachers or students, and certainly didn't help my grades (though I did manage to pass).I have always been curious and very easily bored to tears, the latter also adding to my fondness of “zoning out”. But the hunger for intellectual stimulation could not be satisfied by daydreaming alone, and I was always reading fantasy books, science stuff, and the Guinness Book of World Records, as well as watching cartoons and reading all types of comic books. My father always bought me and my brothers things like microscopes, telescopes, electronics kit, and chemistry sets, which we played with.Even after I returned to Brazil at the beginning of adolescence, most classes and school activities were neverSome respite came from interacting with my grandfather, who was a civil engineer and a professor at a local university who was fond of puzzles and an admirer of great geniuses of the past like Karl Friedrich Gauss. We discussed several philosophical and scientific issues, and I owe him a lot of my reasoning skills (he was an unparalleled master of theWhen it came time to enroll in higher education, I chose Electrical Engineering, as I couldn't really make up my mind and it seemed natural to follow the family tradition. But I got bored senseless by classes where huge weekly exercise lists in Calculus and Algebra were mind-numbingly tedious, and I felt like I was being “trained” to quickly solve problems one could look up in certain tables of derivatives and integrals, or simply in moving around math symbols according to certain rules. By this time I was already interested in intelligence and IQs and began spending huge amounts of time at the university library reading up on that rather than on the contents of my classes, with the expected deleterious impact on my grades.After two years I dropped out of Engineering and enrolled into Psychology, seeking to study intelligence. In this new major, the main problems were the lack of depth of many professors, shortcomings in much of the knowledge being presented, and foolish stubbornness on my part in refusing to learn certain subjects in certain ways (I could have made more of an effort to just put my head down and get on with it - it wouldn't have cost my soul, even if that was my excuse at the time).In parallel to all of this , since the age of 13 I had been working with my father in statistical data analysis, first just helping with data entry and, later on, in a firm he set up to offer services in quantitative data analysis in Education and Medicine. Hard and demanding work, but gratifying, allowing me to learn a lot from my father (damn good in Statistics and world-class in Probability Theory), as well as from the experience.In my late twenties I began working gigs in English-Portuguese simultaneous translation for a specialized company. This gave me enough income to get married.Things only really started getting together for me academically and professionally when I applied for the master’s program in Cognitive Psychology at a local university (one of the top 10 universities in Brazil and the best master’s program in Psychology). There were 80 candidates for 10 spots and I got in in 3rd place, without really studying, behind only two people who were already professors. From then on, I graduatedAfter my masters I began teaching in Management (HR Management, Organizational Behavior and Statistics) in a private university, where I was part of a three-person team who won a national award for a paper presented at a conference of the National Association of Graduate Programs in Management. This was during the second year of my entering the doctorate in Cognitive Psychology at the same university where I did my master’s. Two years later I finished my Ph.D. alsoThe year I finished my Ph.D. I was hired by the same university as a professor in the Department of Management Sciences, where I am to this day, teaching at both graduate and undergraduate levels, as well as doing research. I focus mostly on the psychological impacts of the Digital Revolution, human values, and social representations, as well as people management, innovation, organizational cognition, business consulting processes, and similar subjects. The bulk of my work involves the application of statistical techniques to all sorts of human and/or social phenomena in order to test or help building scientific models.I still hunger for intellectual stimulation and, recently have added Quora to my menu of mental stimuli, together with academia, news, scientific publications, TV series, movies, PC games and so on.The best depiction I saw of my mental processes was in the movieI recognized the thought patterns as similar to my own but remained quiet while watching the movie with my wife, only to have her turning to me and saying: “that is EXACTLY what you do!” (BTW, her IQ is very high , well into the “gifted” range, but I got some 15 points on her, even though she does beat me at plenty of other mental stuff).",UNKNOWN,T.L.

The people living in this district have an average IQ of 117+. It is the region with the highest IQ in China. (Note: It is also the “highest level of English Proficiency” in China and A large part of ""the traffic from China on Quora"" is from here.) And almost everyone in my company has 140+ IQ. So there is no field I am more ascendancy than them.When you are consistent with the IQ of the people around you (other's is 140+, I am 145+), there will be no accidents between us, but we will live and work like ordinary people. We will cooperate and achieve a stable balance. The capital market (in the long run) makes no one overestimated or undervalued.In our company, you will see too many smart people:They all are not only smart but hardworking, and then every step of their career (such as the three significant filters, See Chapter 3.3) were on the right track.—————————————————————3.1 The “excited” of meeting wise people on my road has inspired me – I must enter their group.In High school, my life is full of mediocrity and idiots—I am disappointed with their reaction, thinking ability and knowledge. They can discuss a silly question for a long time, but maybe their words are equivocated and their central point is not clear. I worry that staying with them will affect my brain. After all, ""stupidity is an infectious disease,"" and I need a teammate who’s worthy of me or on the same level as me.(Perhaps they think that my EQ is low, just because I don't bother to show my ""high EQ"" in front of them. I only want to put my attention on the things I focus on, which is more valuable.)When I talk to my classmate in freshman, I can swiftly predict the direction of their thoughts flow. When someone says the first sentence, my brain will calculate their second and third that he will say next... until ""What will he say to end this conversation?""(It is tedious to talk with them, but when someone can say some elusive thing which let me be unpredictable — it will attract my attention, make me feel breath held; he will become my confidant, or she will become my desire.)The biggest problem I encountered in my social interaction was that ""other people's thinking speed can't keep up with mine"" so that I feel tired ""when I talk to them."" More tiring is that ""others can't catch the key point in my words."" On the contrary, if I encounter similar people, it will be a conviviality~Until the end of my sophomore, because I meet smart people occasionally, I decided to join them (then I heard that we had an advanced class at my university, so I was excited).—————————————————————3.2 In the circle of smart people, we talk at a common languageWhen I came to this circle of smart people, I couldn’t predict what they will say in the next sentence after everyone said the first—theirs have a large amount of information!! Now I am fond of chatting with them because theirs are uncertainty, so their words have the value exchanged with me.Our eastern culture promotes ""euphemism,” but sagacious people never roundabout. They like to express their demands straightforwardly and take each other's needs without wasting any time on Mediation. So It’s easy to talk to each other-mere One simple eye-contact or unfinished words they will grasp the other side's share instantly.In short, that is cheerful~When I was a child, I was glad to read some shrewd reasoning in some redoubtable books. Now I am more delighted to work with them. Just like “there is a resonance between people in the same frequency band,” we collide with various inspirational sparks. We can be immersed in the lucid and meticulous logic of each other when communicating, just like two PCBs matched precisely between the needles and pins during the insertion.Since the circle of smart people is better, how do I join it(in China)?—————————————————————3.3 Three significant filters in domestic ChinaIQ is a “genetic lottery.” In the decades, a large number of new populations emerging in mainland China have made many people participate in this lottery, so naturally more people are Hit The Jackpot. They are gathered here (or more developed areas) where everyone in this circle will not look smarter.Note: In fictional stories (such as TV shows/movies), to express high IQ, the screenwriter will put Sherlock and Komikado in the lower IQs group- so that they will be unusually dramatic.However This has led to an imbalance, but the system will eventually be balanced – I entered college in 2012 and graduated from college in 2016, I saw highly Social mobility in China where higher educational people from each region flow, to more developed cities to achieve a balance in the new circle. So, in reality, Sheldon will not be friends with Penny (unless he is in the ""social investigation or user research"" purpose).Many high IQ people I know don't like ""show their superiority in a group of ordinary people,” but want to enter the smart people circle (such as Admitted to a prestigious school and achieve higher level qualifications) and become a member so that they are not alone.For each, it is ""attacking-monster, passing, upgrade, change map"" (Note: it is a Chinese Internet catchphrase, meaning - Attacking-monster: problem-solving, passing: passing the exam, upgrade: Getting growth, change map: going to a bigger city.) and for China it is a ""crowd screening system."" Every screening makes those smarter and more knowledgeable people come to more developed cities. There are at least three significant filters in China:As long as your IQ is high enough, you will climb to the next ""higher platform"" and then PK with the world's top person. The spires of each field are full of great masters, such as Peter Scholze, Terence Tao, Zhiwei Yun in mathematics; Ke Jie and Junghwan Park in the area of Go.You will never be satisfied, always thinking about trying to catch up with them, surpass them, and move forward to the next level.Like “（水涨船高）A ship rises with the tide,” this time your partner, friends, colleagues, classmates are also a group of high IQ. When you reach a certain level, you can't stop your steps, because once you stay, you feasible never be able to keep up with them.—————————————————————3.4 More brutal competitionCompetition in many areas is cruel; they are like ""the decisive battle between the strongest brains"" - but there is no rehearsal, nor a frolic. I see too much high-IQ friends, and colleagues will suffer from insomnia, anxiety and even depression. They are struggling almost in a sleepless night, day and night, and recurring.There is an old Chinese saying: ""天外有天，人外有人""(There are skies beyond our skies, and there are people more excellent than us.) Whenever you go to the bigger and higher platforms, you can always see someone who is more intelligent than you.Recognize IQ, know that someone higher than you or lower than you, to accept the IQ gap between people and to better understand yourself—I have a deeper understanding of how much difference between myself and those who are more intelligent in the world and that great wisdom in history— I understand where my admiration for great men comes from.Remember: ""People with high IQs need to take advantage of ""God's gift"" to push forward the frontiers for all mankind, not to be complacent in your known areas.""======================================2. When I am smarter than everyone (In college, they realize that I am smarter than them).2.1 Overestimate me and over-interpret everything I do.When I was in freshman, the IQ of people around me was 120–130, and they could feel that I was unmistakably smarter than them. In this peer group where their level is some gap from mine, it is easy to do everything, because other people's expectations for this peer group are based on its average, so necessarily it is ""their expect lower than my level of competence."" In the end, they overestimate me, expecting me to come up with a plan or make a work that will ""boggling their minds.”During my undergraduate, the teacher gave me the hardest question. My classmates called me ""guru"" and kept asking me questions: ""How to plan my life?"", ""Which electives should I choose?"", ""How to choose my professional direction?"", ""Who is more suitable to be my boyfriend?"", and ""What should I do when I graduate from college?""So in the second semester, I barely went to class. Once I sneaked into the classroom and found out that the teacher was over-interpreting what I had made, let my classmates analyze what was in it... In fact, I unplanned made it for cope with my school assignment perfunctorily.Whenever the term begins, mid-term, and end of the term are ""a peak period asking me questions,"" I need to find a secluded corner to read books and turn off my phone because there are too many people to ask me, it is annoying~Some ""pragmatic"" schoolfellow is anxiety for successes. To ask me to answer their own questions, some alumni invited me to have dinner, and some alumna seduces me to the bed. (If the gorgeous but uneducated girl sleeps with me, I will feel sick. Although I am heterosexual, I only like ""serious"" girls—I like to watch them work ""concentratedly,” such as writing Code or artistic creation.)—————————————————————2.2 Guessed the next sentence that someone else wants to say / blacklisted people with low communication valueWhen some Average person just finished their first sentence, I can already guess what they will say in the second and third. Most of the time I have no patience to listen to them, but when I am in a good mood, I will also drop them some hints.But some stupid people, when I talked about the fifth and sixth sentences, were still thinking about what my second sentence meant. After this conversation, they have forever lost ""the qualification to talk to me"" (yes, this requires me to apply and make an appointment), I will ""block"" them.There is a saying in China called ""猪队友”(incompetent teammate). Yes, I can't stand stupidity. The fool is really going to end my patience endlessly so that I can't find the meaning of clear up their messy situation. Not everyone with high IQ has the communication experience to give them counselling.When my IQ is much higher than most people in my group, I don't like to communicate with them. Because we are not on the same page, it is impossible to absorb some ""nourishing information"" from there.I don't participate in any prattles, because the primary purpose of chatting is to ""exchange information effectively"". And I know that my own time is more efficient than the others. So it is better to shut up and to do my own thing earlier.In short, to stay away from the environment which low signal-to-noise ratio (all the noises discussed by the stupid people), most of my time spent in the library.—————————————————————2.3 I self-taught because of I above our syllabus level & I also helped the teacher finish their courseware.When in high school, I never listened to lessons because those were too plain... I didn’t need to attend, so I felt that many teachers are blather and even textbooks were twaddle. When my school sent the books to us in the first week, I had already read them all. So when the teachers taught them in class, I knew everything they would talk about, so it would be dull. This habit has continued into my university days.In college, I can't understand ""Why other students spend 45 minutes in the classroom, but I can learn it by watching PPT while spending 5 minutes in our dormitory."" and even more profound content teachers taught us that it can be found in the library (Our lecturers and professors infrequently have their unique perspectives.) Generally, I seldom went to class, but my teachers send me their PPT. I read it and wrote my Modification suggestion.Because I am thinking fast, I always far ahead of the learning progress of my classmate. I need to slowly wait for them to reach my conclusion after a long time, or I will do not know ""where I leave them behind.”When someone speaks, I have to wait for them; When attending classes, I have to wait for them; At the work meeting, I have to wait for them ... The slow pace of teaching makes me intolerable, especially tired and irritable, just like walking, stopping, walking…stop and go, stop and go. Sometimes I complete the whole problem, but I found that my classmates are still far behind me.To reduce my learning speed, I will ""run with heavy burdens,” such as multi-threaded tasks, but they are still a lot slower, sometimes when I come up with six solutions, they have not even finished their first plan.I am afraid that this will waste my precious time, so I rarely attend classes. I read the textbooks myself and then advanced self-study content through the materials online or in the library.PS: Because my family is poverty, I don't like to see a doctor. I usually read the medical thesis and then cure mine. For example, I have cured my ""spotted vision"", sinusitis, tympanitis and so on.—————————————————————2.4 What I have said carries a lot of weightI never talk nonsense, so every time I open my mouth, the whole class will fall into silence. Maybe because of some of the key points I mentioned makes they suddenly start to think deeply.If someone asks me a question without ""done their homework"" (they should have thoroughly searched the related topic), I will blacklist them and not give them any chance because it wastes my time.When someone asks me questions, I usually build a map in my mind (including links and related classify. I will select types and summarize the problem categories and difficulty levels, judge the other party's ability or degree of understanding, and give answers which most suitable for them). If they have a strong understanding ability, I will choose to guide their thinking direction; if they have a weak understanding ability, I will give them multiple answers and let themselves choose.I spend most of the time studying ""how to tell this picture to others""— I will understand what kind of thinking view they are in so that I can draw the image of the level of their ability in my mind.It is “empathy”— I organize my language and try to explain it with their words that their can understand (But before I entered college, such as my elementary and middle school days, no matter how I told the students around me, they couldn't understand my words.)My schoolmates say that about me: ""I asked Chier Hu for a half-hour professional question and the topics discussed can be used for thinking about half a year for me."" Which content they obtained is better than over the two-month program in the teacher’s class (this sentence reflects the boringness of Chinese education, but my sharing knowledge is especial wit.)—————————————————————2.5 Social - I decline most of the invitation because my time is more treasured.In senior, every time some investors passes by Wuhan, they will find me to dine out.They ask me to introduce promising projects in local or take me to ""Interview the project"" directly. In the interview, those startups--What level of their personnel? Is there a market for their product? What is their biggest problem?…(I can get some information that the investors want from just a few words.)In the end, I had been to all the Michelin starred restaurants in Wuhan almost a dozen times.After I left my school, I also found that in Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen--Tsinghua-related success stories forums, IT conferences and industry summits were popular. They often invite me to be a guest.I never point out that they ""what you fail because is your IQ is bad"" (its political is not correct), but hypocritically says ""as long as you work hard, you can succeed""... Later, I don't participate in any social activities most of the time. I think most people are talking Crap, and most of them are not necessary.2.6 I can find any job I wantThe most significant benefit of high-IQ is ""I can find any job I want."" Although I am responsible for product design in my studio at university, I want to challenge my IQ, so I had attended an interview for back-end programmers in Alibaba. During the interview, I can see at a glance the security vulnerabilities of the website that Interviewers is showing me, and then analyze the possible consequences with them... I finally ""teach them a lesson"". So I got an internship in network security.I almost got the Offers of all my interested companies in China. Every day, the “New Friends” column of my Wechat is filled with dozens of headhunters' invitations to add me.In the summer of sophomore and junior, I participated in the internship of Tencent and Alibaba. As an intern, I crossed multiple industries and quickly reversed the competitor's encryption protocol (hardware communication protocol and software protocol)...But because Most of our work is ""reverse engineering"" of advanced Internet products in the US. After a few months, I was tired of ""plagiarism and imitation-oriented work"" and thought that they would not bring something different to the whole world but just ""copy to China.”I didn't handle my relationship well with my mentor. I despised his research. He gave me a low score (To express dissatisfaction with it, I bypassed the school firewall and hacked into the university system to modify my scores. But it finally discovered by the careful teacher and I was eventually being Punished by the school), which made my undergraduate degree delayed and I didn't have the chance to go to Stanford. (Even if I am accepted, my family can't afford the tuition fee for that Extortionate price)======================================1. When the IQ gap is a stark contrast, they regard me like an alien and can't understand me at all.1.1 Not realizing that I am smarter than others—Realize the gap between them and me1.1.1 Why is the answer so evident?""Why there is an optimal solution in front of us, but everyone does not do it."" In my childhood, I thought that I was ""born stupid"" because I couldn't understand it, ""Why is their mind too blind to see the obvious plan? No, it must be because I still have something I didn't count or some ideas I never really think it through.""1.1.2 Not realizing that I am smarter than othersAt that time, I always felt that ""They could answer the task which I easily understand."" Yes, I didn't think I am smarter than them nor distinct from them. (Every time we encounter a problem, I can always see the right answer through it just at my little glance, but they have to spend a lot of time to digest it. When we befall a conundrum as if I found a valued treasure— I was aroused to surmount it; instead, they fear and evade it. So I never fall under the same type of puzzle, and they vice versa.)Heck, I used to think that I was just a general person and my Buddies can comprehend what I mean. But in the process of chatting and playing with them, I often feel frustrated.The teachers often query me:Some of the reviews I continuously hear from my classmates is:And I usually think:Yes, it was not until the third grade of primary school that I thinly discovered that their were slow-witted and lack of capacity to understand.1.1.3 my overwhelm IQ is rolling theirsI smoothly got the highest score in our whole school. They make their great efforts but barely scraped through. I felt a little sorrowful for them—these made me once thought that they are Thick-headed, later we measured the IQ to know that I was outstanding. Realizing that ""not they are stupid but I am smartest"" is critical to my self-awareness.When I was in grade school, because I was much higher than the IQ of the people around me, I felt that I was too deviant. (Imagine how you as an adult get along with a 6-year-old girl? Yes, that's the kind of feeling - I can rashly get things that they are strain every nerve but can't do. I can say that my overwhelm IQ is rolling theirs.)When I graduated from there, almost everyone wrote on my schoolmate record that I was ""eccentric loner."" The gap between mine and theirs is so wide that it produced a ""rejection reaction."" When at secondary school (my family was not sufficient financial for me to go to key one), I was still viciously attacked from my peers, so that I didn't have any friend at school.1.1.4 Realize the gap between them and meBut in junior high school, I awaken that ""I am not be understood"" is based on ""theirs and my thinking ability are not at the same level,” so gradually I don't care about these irrational evaluations.So I never contend with people around me, because that would only ""bounded my horizons."" In the six-year primary school career, even though I was lying down listening to classes, but my every subject had a Full score. Then, I am conscious of that they and I would go to the vastly different competitive platform. My future opponents are those who lived in denser urbanisation and as brilliant as me.Until I changed the social circle through my academics (entered prestigious university) and chose my friends selective through my high-IQ (found excellent jobs), which is getting better and better (See Chapter 2 and 3).—————————————————————1.2 Communication disordersI am considered to be ""aloof and chilly"" because it is too waste my words to explain my thinking logic. Sometimes I make a point but they Unable to follow after I am a lot of talking for a long time. For escape this crass conditions, I just pretend that I am wrong because even if they understand and can't make any meaningful answers.1.2.1 My Counter-intuitive abstract thinkingI admit that there is a stark difference between low/ medium- IQ and high-IQ: high IQ is fond of to use numbers and models to explain an event. But the middle/ low IQs can only accept metaphors, fairy tales, and cases, and the abstracted thing is incomprehensible for them.Since I have superior logic skills, it is hard for me to refrain from my natural impulse of thinking (just as a pretty girl will be more inclined to show charm). Over time, abstract thinking becomes my instinct; it repels my physical and Image thought.The oral communication between individuals in human society is based on formalized thinking, which erects ""external communication barriers"" in my adolescent stage. My expression will also be widely misunderstood by the public - just as ""geek"", their mentioned.1.2.2 My answer is not understandable?In the view of ordinary people-- I observe problems at “bizarrerie” angles which differed from their major concern. Everyone thinks that I offered the “unorthodox” solution.I am unappreciated - others don't agree to owe to think that my method is quite baffling. But after their long-term thinking or long-rung practice has shown that--there are too excessive details that they didn't conceive of, but I have already well considered it. My odd proposal is practically the best.Of course, in junior and senior of the university, everyone felt that my suggestion was Avant-garde, cause they were highly educated.1.2.3 Antipathy to discussingMy contemplation is ""web.” When someone talks about a point, a clear logic network has been laid out in my mind, so it is easy to understand ""what details are important in the plan, and which ones are not important."" At the same time, I will find that they are always split hairs and wasting time in unimportant details.Although I can quickly see the flaws in their thought, but it is easy to cause quarrels because point out their mistakes, so I always silently do my private things when others are discussing (as long as they don't force me to waste time together. But they often feel that others are working harder and I am idle.)Discussing problems with other people made me irritable. When the host throws a question, everyone enters the discussion, but the speed is really making me an impatient. For example, I have always imagined dozens of possible solutions along with a problem, and demonstrated the difficulty and feasibility of each route, and selected the best way. (When they said A, I had already conceived: ""A may lead to B, C, D, and B may lead to E, F, G....."", and incidentally give each possibility a weight, Ranked in order.)Then, they just came up with one possible solution, and I usually point out that ""their route is not going to work"" because I have been complete the argumentation in my mind. Later, I felt that their discussion was unimaginative, and I didn't like to negate others frequently. In the end, I became mute and apathy.I never participate in other people's ""brainstorming"" owing to ""my pondering is more efficiency"" -- I can make a ripe decision by closing my eyes for three minutes. Instead, they have to argue disorderly for the whole afternoon but without any meaningful results emerge.I detest the group discussion. I think that ""information resources determine who have right to speak"" - if someone doesn't get information about this issue, and haven't unique insights, why do we need to have a meeting with and listen their Speaking which monotonous and chaotic logic?1.2.4 More preference for solitude than teamworkI progressively become solitary, and I was bored stiff in talking to others because they are tangled with some common questions and chatter about it.I prefer to be immersed in my own world because I have to wait for others to think and to understand my words for a long time, which makes me weary. I am disturbed by others at every turn, so most of the time I need to stay alone.1.2.5 Disobedient, society-maladjusted, and thus painfulIn China, we have to bow to authority. It is troublesome for me to adapt it. You need to obey the commands absolutely, and brainless execute it:In middle school, ""you must answer the questions according to the method taught by the teacher. Otherwise, it will not be scored."" I used my own trick to answer the question correctly, but it is counted zero;In university, ""the teacher has set a particular subject limit, and you must follow it"". Otherwise, even if my works blowing everyone's mind, I fail in the exam because I digress from the subject.Yes, Blind obedience makes them easier to survive and ""follow it like sheep"" will gain happiness. I thought ""鹤立鸡群(I am a crane standing among chickens)"", but actually ""羊入狼群(I am a sheep in a pack of wolves)"".—————————————————————1.3 I can see the IQ gap at a glance - who is the smartest in the class?I can quickly identify ""the IQ gap between theirs and mine"": Who is quick-witted and Who is dim-witted?This is especially true in high school mathematics classes: The teacher explaining a problem…when it was halfway, someone called ""Aha, That's it! I get it!"", they are Straight B-students.—————————————————————1.4 Keep a low profile to escape the expectations of school administrators and parents.1.4.1 My father first discover that I was a prodigy.When I was 4, dad's friend sent him a bicycle. He rode it up and said that its chain would fall at every turn and could not be used regularly, so he put it in the warehouse.One day, I rode it. I tested and found that its chains will definitely fall after pedalling 13 spins, then I will only treading for about 10 turns and then rollback a spin to fix it.My dad saw that I rode such a dilapidated bicycle well and was extremely shocked. Then I told him about the secret of it. He thought I was a prodigy.1.4.2 From showing off to shutting upBefore my junior middle era, I sometimes inadvertently shot others down or offend them, but I am not aware of it. When I was 8th-grade, I said to them: ""I know the answer after reading this description, but you have tossed a class and asked the teacher from side to side?"" This made me displease my classmates. I have had too many examples of ""disregarding the opinions of others, only for my temporary Whimsy, but finally regretting."" Then, I have begun to understand how to shut up and follow their words of others.After my junior middle era, I gradually understood most of the human behaviour patterns. I began to become more sophisticated and never ""blasted off on the spur for tongue's joy"". I understood, ""If you are right, you don’t have to speak it out to hurts Self-esteem of others.""I have become ""中庸""(moderate) — I don't like to argue with others right or wrong. In life, I have tried hard to put my superiority away. I don't speak directly to the people around me but gratify them.1.4.3 What is the feeling of being drowned in praise?I grew up with innumerable compliments which eulogize me for being smart. However, I have always scorned it, and I feel that people who acclaim me are stupid. Of course, I seem to be courtesy on the surface and humble in my life. I don’t have many words and never boast of myself. Because I disdain their compliments, I won't take the initiative to reveal myself or show off something.Although I was keenly aware that the people around me are mostly mediocre, I never show my felt. I just think that there are many people—""Things that make them happy or troubled?"" are ridiculous in my opinion, they are uninteresting.For a lot of things, they think that I am an anxious alarmist and their feelings that my troubles are concern unnecessary. Yes, I have been worried since childhood that the Western free world technology has stagnated. China, Russia or Islamic countries have technically surpassed the US to conquer the Western world and humanity may be returned to “the Middle Ages”. Or controllable nuclear fusion is the next Great Filter.I didn't want to be an overachiever to work hard. So I don't want to participate in any competition that can win extra points, because I don't want to be noticed by others, and I don't want to get absurd recognition from them.The school used to let my parents introduce teaching secret. Many local reporters come to my home interviewed my family for ""how to educate the children"". My parents just said that they have no control me. They let me share my methods of learning or ""how hard I work"". But I can't tell them the truth - ""I am a high IQ indolent person, without any advanced studying skill.""In short, during my growing up, because I can readily meet the requirements from most external worlds (such as academic achievements, talents, and other people's appreciation, etc.)—I feel that is not challenging enough, so my own internal world worked out some goals to let myself do it and judge it.======================================0. Something that is happening at each stage of my life:0.1 Stand taller, see farther, but feel more self-abasedIt’s easy for me to generalize the rules of everyday events—I can easily understand the motivations of everyone, what will happen next, and what will happen in the future. In my mind, the farther this event is, the more blurred the image is. For example, there will be an image visible in the next six months but maybe only defocus image in the next decade.“When the engine was invented, most could have predicted the automobiles, but only the wise could have predicted the traffic jam.”Yes, the IQ is equivalent to ""how high you are standing at the height in the world"". The smartest people I know are more able to stand up higher and see the bigger picture, to better control the changes in the overall situation.It is precise that we can see a bigger world than ordinary people, thus know more about how tiny we are. I often explain my high IQ to others like this: ""There are always a few in a group of ants who can find the shorter path and more food, but for the universe, they are meaningless.""0.2 My life is always lacking in surprise.When they exclaim that: ""What an awesome person, he is!"" ""This book is genius!"" ""This article is insightful! ""...but I have never experienced those. I can see at a glance to point out"" which is outstanding qualities of it"" and which is its ""insufficiency.""Because I subconsciously think that ""everything is achievable"".Yes, when I come across some fantastic works or products, I will immediately wonder if I can do it, rather than immersing myself in envy or jealousy like them.Whenever I run into a new thing, it's simple for me to combine my past insights with discoveries and quickly notice these connections between them. For any new knowledge, unique experience or new cognitions, I will soon see through its essence, and discover that is actually ""something I am familiar with"". The reason for the novelty, It just steps forward a bit from the known. So I often say to them who are shocked: ""This thing as a matter of XXX, 太阳底下没有新鲜事(there is nothing new under the sun).""Because my brain apace turns unknown things into known, everything has a short shelf life for me (they will soon growing stale for me). As I am getting older, I am going to see less and less wonder, and more disappointed.—————————————————————0.3 Secret about my brain0.3.1 My high-speed brain is hard to stopIn addition to meditation and sleep, my brain is running at high speed, and it has been analyzing—when I think about problems, it consider about the possibilities as much as it can, and subconsciously calculate the different benefits of various situations and choices.Typically, my thinking is exceptionally active. When my brain can't stop basically, sometimes I feel fatigued. The more I want to cease, the higher the speed it rotates at, which requires constant intellectual stimulation and formidable challenges. Just like ""a high-performance computer consumes more power"", my brain consumption is also massive.0.3.2 pastime my excess intelligenceIn the adolescent, my peers secreted a lot of sex hormones and have a ""chemical reaction"" to the opposite sex, but I only felt suffocated and heartbeat for some ""unsolvable problems.""Imagine that you had a ""powerful computer produced in 2018"" in 2008, but ""the software in 2008"" wanted to run the ""computer from 2018"" full of memory, so you need to run massed complicated programs at the same time.Meh, I am afraid of doing nothing, because it will make me feel emptiness. So I always find something working manually with my brain to kill my free time — for example, playing games, Sudoku or writing code.In short, my brain can't halt, and it continually seeks to ""vent to lead off my intelligence.""0.3.3 I love to sleep, my brain is tired, and it can't last long.I have envied those who can ""always work from early to late"". With I grew up, my apparent feeling is that my brain is extremely easy to fatigue and can't last. I can keep learning for up to 3 hours a day, then I feel dazzling and can no longer read that book, maybe my brain cost too much energy to support.This process is consuming tremendous energy which takes me a lot of time to recover. The best way is to go to sleep. Sometimes I admire the average person who can ""fight a long-drawn war.""Yes, my mind can't stop once I work. I can't ""shut down"" my supercomputer unless I meditate or sleep.—————————————————————0.4 Speak at triple speed, watch videos at 4 times speed.IQ is reflected in the speed to master new things. Whenever a new item is learned in a school, soon I can understand it, and the teacher just thought that I have already studied it. But it is the gap in IQ.Compared with ordinary people, new information will be accepted by me faster, integrated into my brain, and they have a higher level of application in my neural network. If theirs is HDD, then mine is SSD, it is fast to store and read, so the overall effect is smooth.Because my information processing speed is breakneck, I watch many videos or TV shows played at 4x speed, and I set Apple's speech or Google's ""text to speech"" to ""the fastest speed"" when I am listening to books.BTW, others think that my speech is very fast, but I feel that my speaking speed can't keep up with my thinking speed, so I usually type my words to explain my thoughts (I type 300 Chinese characters or 100 English words in one minute).—————————————————————0.5 More possibilities0.5.1 cover a wider range of→ almost unlimited choices in my careerI like to explore new areas—when I discover something I have never seen before, there is a sense of merriment that ""opens up a new world.""Yes, high-IQ is always more choices, I seem to have unlimited possibilities — I like to remodel the piano when I have some free time, I have transformed a transparent digital piano and an illuminated piano with the chromatic keys. I also designed a light field display solution for AR. I recently created an illuminating string guitar…0.5.2 I am a generalist who awes the specialist.I became a generalist in all fields (I can get 80 points for all my subjects), but I often venerate that specialist (they can only reach 95 points just in their specific field).No matter what I study, I can learn better than ordinary people, but what is the choice best for me? My interests are too broad, and I ""浅尝辄止 (put away the cup after taking a tiny sip: stop after a smattering of knowledge)"" in any subject. It’s hard to find what I want to do and let myself be fully engaged. The greed of my brain is like a valley that can never be filled— I eat a bowl (the knowledge that I have learned) but looking at the pot(the knowledge that I want to learn).I often don't want to learn the same thing - every time a subject reaches 80 points, I am confused and have a sense of urgency, and I start to learn another thing. In the end, every subject reached 80 points but did not get the eye-catching top score, so I am more respectful of the specialist (95 points+).",0 followers,Ashok Bishnoi,15.4K,314,7.7M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-is-it-like-to-have-an-extremely-high-IQ-2

And thus, I appreciate you taking the time to read this.Now.I know most people tend to resent those who are more intelligent than them, and I understand the reasoning for why that is. However, it’s common to only focus on the positives and thus underestimate the negatives.There are plenty of negative attributes associated with having a high IQ, but they can all be traced back to this very fact:Really lonely.IQ operates on a normal distribution curve.See here:Well okay, so what does this mean?It means that the higher up you go, the more of an oddity you are to those around you.By pure statistics, if you’re born with a high IQ then you’re automatically a “weirdo.”Just look at the percentages.I enjoy discussing the concept of free will, simulation theory, the fermi paradox, and other “weird” things. But most people don’t. Most people rather go clubbing, play fantasy football, or gossip about celebrities. And there’s nothing wrong with that. It’s just that those things literally give me a headache. And I too have noticed that the things I’m genuinely interested in give these people a headache as well. So it’s two-sided dilemma here.Okay…So what?In regards to the quantity of people that exist in which I can discuss the things that I’m genuinely interested in, that number is very small compared to the number for the majority of people. For example, at my current university, the majority of students here enjoy their leisure time by drinking, going out to bars, and attending frat parties. All of which I despise, and this pattern can be found at 99.9% of all other colleges as well.And thus, the social fabric of my environment doesn’t cater to my needs. So if I ever wanted to “fit in” then I would have to participate in activities that I have a strong distaste for. I’m basically forced to wear a mask every day. Although I hate small talk, I must deal with it because there’s no other alternative. Although I hate bars, I’ve felt compelled to go to them in my past because everybody else was. The only thing was that they were actually enjoying their time whereas I wasn’tAlso, I’m a human being.If one traveled back in time and observed our ancestors, he or she would notice that we lived in close-knit communities. We did this because there was a better chance of survival. This means that we evolved to cherish social interaction, and that sociality is literally rooted in our DNA.Because of the contrasting social environment to my innate preferences, I don’t find myself socializing with a lot of people. And usually, when one doesn’t socialize with a lot of people, he or she will experience more feelings of loneliness compared to somebody who does.And even when I do decide to socialize with others, the interactions aren’t meaningful to me. My mind needs to be intellectually stimulated. If it isn’t, then I’ll literally be in a bad mood until it is. Most of the intellectual stimulation I receive isn’t from people, but from technology. So although that need is getting fulfilled, my innate desire for connection with other humans is still empty. As most people don’t really connect with me either.IAnd there’s nothing I can do to change it.So in regard to the overall social fabric of society, having a high IQ is inevitable loneliness. And because humans are social creatures, higher levels of loneliness will result in depression, mood disorders, and more—all of which I unfortunately have been diagnosed with and experience daily.But even outside of social interaction, I’m still a loner in essentially every domain of life.Take education for example.Whether we like it or not, we are all a part of a society. And our society forces us to go through systems that are designed for a specific type of individual.School has to be standardized. This means that it’s designed to suit the majority of the population. And this only makes sense when you think about it. Why would a standardized system ever be designed to cater to the minority group? It’s the most logical method.One’s achievement in school is based on a multitude of factors. However, there is one factor that outweighs all of the others. And it’s not intelligence, but grit. You don’t need to have a high IQ to be a valedictorian. There are so many other factors, like parental pressures, social conditioning, closed vs. open mindsets, etc. that all play equally important if not larger roles.Intelligence is only one of many.And based on my personal experience as well as the conclusions I’ve made about other high IQ people I’ve interacted with: school just isn’t our cup of tea. And this is mainly because our learning styles generally diverge from the methodology of learning enforced by school.For me personally, I’m a top-down thinker. This means that I like to start at the higher concepts and then work my way down to the smaller parts. I despise memorizing facts, punching in numbers, and following rubrics because they all counter the way my mind naturally functions. However, these things are what make up the majority of tasks in a given school environment. I also have a very hard time staying attentive to things that don’t intellectually stimulate me.So basically all of school…I honestly envy the people who can just sit in a classroom, pay full attention to the lecturer, and follow the directions properly. Just like that. And then you have cornballs like me, where I’ve developed a dependency on caffeine, amphetamines, and fidget toys to simply get me through my classes. Yeah, I can whine and complain all I want, but I’m still forced to go through the system because I need the credentials in order to find a job.So sociality and education are two facets in life where I’m an outsider, and these are big ones, but there are many more.Yes, having a high IQ correlates with financial stability, good health, and whatnot—but does that really matter compared to one’sI can make all the money in the world, or reach whatever point in my life that equals “success,” but would that even matter if I’m depressed every day?

It was in the 170s, which didn't sound very high to me back then. I'd already had a feeling, even in kindergarten, that I was pretty smart, and destined for greater things. That said, I was certainly not a mathematical prodigy, not bothering with algebra until I was 12. I just really enjoyed drawing, writing, and reading, although I found that I skimmed through passages more often than not. I enjoyed reading dictionaries and encyclopedia.When I was 8, I took part in a national exam to identify gifted children and place them in a separate education program. I remember finding the tests ridiculously easy, although some of my friends in the program said they'd only managed to solve a quarter of the problems and still got in. So I've always been among the smartest of my peers, even when I was mixing with the elite.Yet somehow that never translated to academic excellence. It might have had something to do with the workings of my brain, because I was a very left-brained child, with autistic tendencies almost. Or it could just be how everything seemed so obvious and straightforward to me. Math was fine, but I would have trouble with anything requiring written answers, such as science. I could never understand what teachers meant when they asked me to elaborate my answers. I did below average among students in the program, but still good enough to continue in the program and enter the best school in the country.My academic performance was very discouraging to me. I felt like an idiot compared to everyone else in class. I stopped trying. I spent all my time playing computer games, not even doing any casual reading. I wonder how much my mental development stagnated in those days. Even so, I would show flashes of brilliance, answering questions in class that no one else had any idea about. I aced German tests without even studying. And I always had the sharpest wit around.By the time I went to uni I realised that intelligence alone wasn't enough for success and happiness in life. I worked on my social skills, making more friends of varying levels of intelligence. I started to gain an appreciation of other things in life, such as aesthetics and the humanities. Although I went to a pretty good university, I never met anyone of comparable intellectual ability in 4 years. (One thing I could always do was figure out how intelligent a person was just from talking to them, because I could discern the thought processes behind what they said or did.) Maybe I should have gone to Harvard instead. Then again, most geniuses would have skipped grades and hence be much before their prime while in uni.During my undergraduate years, I was skipping most classes but still doing well. I spent the time on autodidacticism instead. My interests proliferated throughout this time. I taught myself Japanese. I became a foodie. I dabbled in fashion. I explored architecture and interior design. I wrote short stories and composed songs. Whatever I did, I found that I could bring my intelligence to bear and understand it on a deeper level. I started to see the links between all things, and that which makes us human. An amalgam of practical and academic interest saw me go from neuroscience and psychology into philosophy, which used to make me fall asleep in high school but now keeps me up at night. After years of denial, I have finally returned to my true calling. I get into a state of flow just reading and thinking about things. This must be what Aristotle meant when he said the highest purpose of Man was thought. I am making up for lost time now. I spend hours a day reading.I have come to terms with my intellectual passion, and at my age (24) it's no longer something nerdy or geeky to hide, although you do want to describe it in a way that makes you sound like just another human being with his particular passion. Now I am doubly afflicted, being both more intelligent and more knowlegeable than everyone else I know or am likely to meet. Yet my continuous efforts at learning and contemplating have revealed to me, every few months, what a fool I was a few months ago, and how I will laugh at myself in a few months' time.I realise that the most important thing about living as an intelligent person is to be meta-intelligent, i.e. to be intelligent about how you apply your intelligence. Intelligence is a gift, although of course I would say that, wouldn't I. It can also be a curse, if it leads you to wander in the labyrinths of thought, never finding a way out like Newton or Einstein did. But mostly it is a tool, and it is not the right tool for every job. There are times when it is smarter not to think through a problem, where heuristics will satisfice, where neuroplasticity or conditioning provides a better response, where tradition contains hidden wisdom. Use your intelligence to diagnose the things you need to change or learn, and do it. Control the urge to show off, and be truly humble (as C.S. Lewis said, humility is not thinking less of yourself, but thinking of yourself less). There are many more realms in this world than the intellectual, and others may know much more about these than you. Try to see things in the way that others do, and speak to them in ways they can appreciate.Nonetheless, I still yearn for intellectual companionship, both for emotional reasons and for the purpose of synergy, because you can spot the flaws in each other's thought, and also come up with things that neither could have thought of alone. And at this stage in life the right ideas can really bring you places. So for those of you who have come to treat your intelligence as just another part of your life, something inessential and to be suppressed when inconvenient, I urge you to reconsider, and to discover the joy that a life of intellectual pursuit holds.",0 followers,Samuel Billings,9.1K,1.7K,2.2M,2013,https://www.quora.com/What-is-it-like-to-have-an-extremely-high-IQ-2

You’ve been told, not seldomly, that you overthink things. Because, duh, of course you do. Thinking and overthinking is like breathing for you.You are conscious about your “soft” skills, because you know that the smarts need to be complemented with good social skills, and you are worried whether the nature shorthanded you at something else as a compensation for the intellect you got. Most people don’t know your IQ is above 130, because your priority is to be assimilated in the society, not to be an outlier. So, you don’t wear your IQ on your sleeve. You are not a big talker.

32,"I think we are in a simulation, as photons exhibit behaviour that resembles “lazy evaluation” in computing.A single photon is a wave, as double slit experiment shows. However, it is a particle if you measure which slit it took.Now, it gets really weird if you delete the measurement result (Quantum Eraser Experiment.) If you measure which slit, but destroy the measurement result, then the photon is a wave again!So to summarize: a photon is only a particle if you measure which path it tookIt seems nature cares if you are measuring, and what you are doing withI think we are in a simulation, as photons exhibit behaviour that resembles “lazy evaluation” in computing.A single photon is a wave, as double slit experiment shows.

However, do calculate if path information is required because someone measured and did not destroy the measurement result.To conclude: reality is a simulation. And the simulation has been optimized with “lazy evaluation” to reduce the computation time for light paths.",UNKNOWN,Jess H.
