Alice borrows some money from Bob and Bob writes it on a piece of paper signed by Alice. After some days Alice denies the existence of such document and claims that Bob has forged that piece of paper. Bob would now find it difficult to prove that Alice actually owes him Money.In this example Alice and Bob are two nodes.Now assume the same scenario, but among a society. So there are ’k’ pair of people transacting with each other. And the only proof that each pair has, is that piece of paper. Looking at this scenario, one person, Kate comes up with a solution. She suggests maintaining a common notebook of transaction for entire society. She designates town hall to be the place where every exchange takes place. In the common notebook, every pair writes the transaction and then the notebook is kept safely. People rejoice and accept Kate as their leader.That notebook can be called aBut one day, somebody spills wine on the notebook. This makes the notebook illegible. Taking the advantage of this situation, Alice again denies taking money from Bob.This is the problem databases face -Irritated by this problem, Kate comes up with another solution. She suggests maintaining multiple notebooks. She chooses some trustworthy people from the society and gives them a notebook each. Now every time a transaction or exchange takes place between two people, Kate instructs some of those trustworthy people to mention the transaction in their notebooks. So the data is repeated in the notebooks. Now, even if one notebook is destroyed, chances are that all the data regarding transactions are still present in the combination of other notebooks.This is aBut next day, another problem arises. Kate has a friend named Bert who owes a lot of money to some people in the society. He asks Kate for help and she agrees to help him. She instructs all the people with the notebooks to remove the entries where Bert received money. Now Bert doesn’t owe any money based on the notebooks.This is theWhen the people from the society come to know of it, they remove Kate from the leadership.So, well. This is the easiest example I can think of to explain Blockchain. Blockchain is a decentralized, peer to peer, immutable storage network which is censor free and regulator free because of the absence of one single controlling entity. Every transaction that is written is voted upon by a majority of nodes and changing something which was written before in the chain is computationally very difficult.","31,157 followers",Phillip Remaker,1.7K,11K,78.8M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-most-impressive-emerging-technology-in-the-modern-world
