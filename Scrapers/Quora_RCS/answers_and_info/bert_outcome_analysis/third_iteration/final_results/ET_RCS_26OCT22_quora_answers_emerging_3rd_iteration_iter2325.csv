In the earlier times, the use of tools by human beings was for the process of discovery and evolution. Tools remained the same for a long time in the earlier part of the history of mankind but it was also the complex human behaviors and tools of this era that modern language began as believed by many archeologists. Technology refers the knowledge and utilization of tools, techniques and systems in order to serve a bigger purpose like solving problems or making life easier and better. Its significance on humans is tremendous because technology helps them adapt to the environment. The development of high technology including computer technology’s Internet and the telephone has helped conquer communication barriers and bridge the gap between people all over the world. While there are advantages to constant evolution of technology, their evolution has also seen the increase of its destructive power as apparent in the creation of weapons of all kinds. In a broader sense, technology affects societies in the development of advanced economies, making life more convenient to more people that have access to such technology. But while it continues to offer better means to man’s day to day living, it also has unwanted results such as pollution, depletion of natural resources to the great disadvantage of the planet. Its influence on society can also be seen in how people use technology and its ethical significance in the society. Debates on the advantages and disadvantages of technology constantly arise questioning the impact of technology on the improvement or worsening of human condition. Some movements have even risen to criticize its harmful effects on the environment and its ways of alienating people. Still, there are others that view technology as beneficial to progress and the human condition. In fact, technology has evolved to serve not just human beings but also other members of the animal species as well. Technology is often seen as a consequence of science and engineering. Through the years, new technologies and methods have been developed through research and development. The advancements of both science and technology have resulted to incremental development and disruptive technology. An example of incremental development is the gradual replacement of compact discs with DVD. While disruptive developments are automobiles replacing horse carriages. The evolution of technologies marks the significant development of other technologies in different fields, like nano technology, biotechnology, robotics, cognitive science, artificial intelligence and information technology. The rise of technologies is a result of present day innovations in the varied fields of technology. Some of these technologies combine power to achieve the same goals. This is referred to as converging technologies. Convergence is the process of combining separate technologies and merging resources to be more interactive and user friendly. An example of this would be high technology with telephony features as well as data productivity and video combined features. Today technical innovations representing progressive developments are emerging to make use of technology’s competitive advantage. Through convergence of technologies, different fields combine together to produce similar goals.Today’s society is different to the one that existed not so many years ago. Our society is constantly changing. The most important characteristics of our era may be the transformation, transmission and dominion of information. We live in an information society where the leading role has been given to new technologies, especially those devoted to information. Our society could not be imagined without new technologies and their role both in this society and in human life in general.P.S.(it took me a lot of time to write and do research about it,so please leave an upvote)","68,787 followers",Kanthaswamy Balasubramaniam,898,17.3K,413.5M,2017,https://www.quora.com/Is-there-really-a-need-for-more-advanced-technologies-Why-or-why-not

5,"Honestly, they both surpass each other in unique ways. You didn’t ask who had more powerful, but who had more advanced technology, and in that regard there are places where humanity far surpassed Eldar, and places where Eldar far surpassed humanity. Let’s go into detail.Eldar technology is irreversibly connected to their immense psychic might. Almost all of their technology, in one way or another, requires the active participation of it’s user in both shaping and powering the technology.

You didn’t ask who had more powerful, but who had more advanced technology, and in that regard there are places where humanity far surpassed Eldar, and places where Eldar far surpassed humanity. Let’s go into detail.Eldar technology is irreversibly connected to their immense psychic might. Almost all of their technology, in one way or another, requires the active participation of it’s user in both shaping and powering the technology. That isn’t to say they don’t have automatic systems, but their automatic systems are more akin to ghosts keeping things up and running rather than some artificial intelligence. Some examples. Wraithbone, the primary material in Eldar architecture, weaponry, and ship building, is solidified warp energy that has the malleability of clay, and the strength of adamantium. This material is controlled by a bonesinger, who uses their psychic ability to force the bone into shape. Like stated before, this requires the direct input from a living, breathing Eldar. This material far surpasses anything humanity can create, but is difficult to make without a strong psychic presence in the warp.Another example of advanced Eldar technology is their grav technology. Their gravity accelerators power their weapons, create internal environments for their space-craft, and obviously are the cornerstone on which their tanks, jetbikes, and flyers operate. This technology is far more advanced than any human creation, and is both extremely powerful, and extremely precise. It uses just enough force to keep their vehicles in the air, but not enough force to smash the ground beneath them into pulp(like the human counterpart Repulsor does). This technology is less reliant on an Eldar’s direct input, and shows that they have a very detailed understanding of the basic’s of the real universe.The last example for Eldar technology that would surpass human technology, is their world-building technology. They could literally terraform death worlds into paradise’s. Their worlds were perfect in every respect, and it would only take them a matter of months to terraform an entire planet. Maiden worlds are a prime example of their advanced terraforming technology at work. Any time someone encounters a maiden world, they enter a place of heaven-like paradise, with lush jungles and clear waters. Very rarely do these worlds possess dangers beyond the Eldar themselves. Furthermore, these worlds had their own spirits, as any place that is greatly altered by the Eldar would, and would help build new colonies by shifting forests and altering their surface. If anyone should kill the Eldar population on the world, the planet could go insane, lashing out against anyone and anything that would land on its surface. From paradise to death world in a matter of days, these fallen maiden worlds are some of the most dangerous planets in the galaxy. This technology required great psychic and technological understanding to achieve, but also shows the firm grasp on biology the Eldar have.Now let’s talk about humanity. In the area of psychic development, humanity is like a 5 year old child trying to outsmart a PhD in psychology. In terms of world building, humanity has a crude but effective system that wrestles the environments of their worlds into submission, forcing them to become habitable, rather than growing them to be so.However, they aren’t entirely outmatched. When it comes to destructive potential of their weaponry, humanity can match the elder almost perfectly. The D-cannon of an Eldar super-heavy tank can leave holes in reality larger than a 5 story building, but the power of a Belicossa pattern Volcano cannon can level a city block in one blast. Eldar shurikens can rip through adamantium like it were paper, but the power of a Cawl pattern bolt rifle can blast apart wraithbone just as easily. It would seem in terms of weaponry, Eldar technology doesn’t surpass, but rather refocuses. Eldar tech tends to aim more towards exactness and speed, while human technology aims to eviscerate and explode. It’s spear vs Warhammer, where one uses locational damage to bring apart the whole, and the other simply crushes the whole beneath its weight. Different paths, same end.Not only can humanity match the Eldar in certain respects, but in their Golden Age, they would arguably surpass them. In terms of automatic machinery and engineering, humanity was far more advanced. Eldar automation relied on spirits and psychic control, but human machines could work entirely on their own, no directive past what their last command was. They were so advanced, that many of their machines could even think without the influence of a human. They were too advanced it would seem, because these automatic machines would eventually rebel against their creators leading to the most devastating downfall in human history. We can’t compare the “Iron Men” of humanities past to the Wraith-constructs of Pre-Slannesh Eldar, but we can compare their current technology and draw a parallel. A wraithguard is the soul of a warrior Aeldari coaxed into life again in order to protect the truly living. It requires the presence of a Wraithseer over long periods of time, because without one it slowly loses its awareness of the real world and drifts back into death. Compare that to a Kastelan Robot, which requires nothing more than a single command, and you see the difference. While technically a Cybernetica Datasmith is required to keep the machine focused, it will do its task without one present, and will continue to function for literally hundreds of years. Furthermore, a Kastelan Robot would easily overpower and destroy a wraithguard in close combat, and can match one in ranged combat as well. All in all, the automatic machinery of humanity just tends to be better at everything, while requiring less maintenance to be effective. Furthermore, they are easier to make and mass produce, something the Eldar would be incapable of doing.That would be an example of the biggest difference between human technology, and Eldar technology. Eldar tech revolves around their psychic ability, which makes it perfect in a way humanity could never achieve. Human technology on the other hand used conventional science to be effective. It relied on their understanding of engineering and the universe, and would match the Eldar in quantity rather than quality. In places where massive building were needed to make a city, the Eldar would beat the humans in almost any regard. But when it comes to creating the small basic things of the city, humanity would beat the elder. Anything from weapons to cars would be easier to produce by automated machinery than by hand each and every time from a psyker. On a large scale, Eldar beat humanity, but on a smaller one, humans could use their advantage in automation to outmatch the Eldar.All in all, it would be impossible to say which one had more advanced technology overall. The Eldar relied on their psychic might for a majority of their technology, which allowed them to do things humans could literally never achieve with conventional science. However this also meant that in places where psychic concentration would be a consistent necessity, humanity could outmatch them in quantity and quality using conventional engineering to create quick and effective solutions to problems, that might not be as pretty or perfect as Eldar technology, but would be easier to maintain and make. They had different core understandings on how their technology would progress. The Eldar increased their knowledge of warpcraft in order to make the monumental tasks of ship-building and planet colonization possible,. Humans relied on basic industrial creations, relying on automated machinery to help them reach the stars. Eldar technology is more like their nature, smoother, polished, and perfect down to the atoms, but tedious and slow to build. Human technology is more limited by their lack of psychic ability(early stages at least), so is more reliant on their fundamental understanding of their universe, and forcing it to follow their will.An apt metaphor would be that the Eldar are artists. They use their imagination to rule their reality. Humans are engineers. They use their reality to rule their imagination. This leads to awesome creations on both sides, just with different shapes.Thanks for reading this novel, hope you enjoyed.",0 followers,Daniel Peters,695,58,161.2K,2018,https://www.quora.com/Is-there-really-a-need-for-more-advanced-technologies-Why-or-why-not

The Eldar expanded their borders with armies of automatons and wraithbone drones like the wraithknights. Their pinnacle of warp science was that the gods the modern Eldar worship such as Vaul, Asuryan, Khaine and so on were all created to enhance and give boons to their related domains. Vaul was created as an assistant to Eldar craftsmen. Isha would act as a warden to any Eldar who fell ill.In essence, the Eldar created the spiritual version of an AI matrix to solve their problems. This isn’t technology as the Golden Age mankind had but it is a solution to a problem, which is what defines something as technology.Eldar knowledge of the Warp was so sophisticated that its use and understanding could count as a branch of science.Even the more mundane technology appears very high up the tree. Brightlances function very similar to las-weapons but are far more precise and energy-efficient, more effective at burning though whatever composites are popular in the manufactories. It took psychic energy to make the crystals that make this possible but again, this is a solution to a problem so it is possible to say that brightlances are more technologically advanced than lance weapons. Meanwhile the mobility differences between Eldar and Imperial titans are almost mirror to the differences between a Gundam and ED-209. Sure they’re of vastly different scales but in terms of mobility on the battlefield it’s a good comparison.The key difference between the two appears to be that while Eldar industry is craft-oriented due to the need of an intelligence to sculpt wraithbone, Golden Age humanity were able to refine the concepts of mass production and replaceable parts to such a degree that they built digital libraries of schematics that could instruct people with practically zero technical experience how to make a plasma reactor, a heavy tank or a laser gun to name a few. Most of what has been found was intended to help set up colonies on new worlds but this gives a potential indicator of what the Human Federation could achieve at its height.There’s just so much we don’t know about either empire. While much of the technical knowhow from the Golden Age was lost due to the disappearance of most of the STCs and the so-far mythological status of a fully preserved STC, the Craftworld Eldar left behind technologies that they believed contributed to the decline of Eldar society or couldn’t find the time to gather as they fled annihilation. This includes significant things like tools to resurrect the fallen in new Eldar bodies as well as a number of smaller devices designed to make life easier and more leisurely. The spirit stones the Eldar adorn themselves with cannot be made from scratch and can only be made from the crystallised warp energy that forms on the Crone Worlds deep in the Eye of Terror. They have fallen so far that they describe the formation of these crystals (which was in all likelihood could have been a part of the process that allowed the Eldar to overcome death) as one of their gods collecting the tears of another god and forging them into crystals that could contain souls.Imagine if explaining the iPod became a tale of how a god touched sand and copper in Arizona with the ability to trap and store the songs of ten thousand artists, and can perform any one of them whenever asked. That is what has happened to the Eldar knowledge of how to create a spirit-preservation device.This is how the Eldar gods became icons of worship.Both the Eldar (Craftworld and Dark) and the Imperium are pale shadows of their predecessors, but from what we can gather the Eldar Empire at its apex was a realm of godlike beings. Even as huamnity dominated the galaxy in the Golden Age the Eldar Empire remained masters of the galaxy until their fall which coincided with the end of the Age of Strife. So I’m going to have to say the former Eldar Empire was the more advanced one.",16 followers,Gary Zhang,1.5K,538,15.4M,2017,https://www.quora.com/Is-there-really-a-need-for-more-advanced-technologies-Why-or-why-not
7,"It was the AeldariIt was the AeldariThe notion of a straight comparison - a ‘fair’ fight - between ‘A’ and ‘B,’ or a comparison of technology in the same vein - presumes that is what both sides intend. For example, my space marine against your aspect warrior. My bolter versus your shuriken catapult, but where we see that as reasonable, to the Eldar that must seem as pointless as it is obtuse. The whole idea is not to compare but to forego a comparison by forcing a conclusion.Thus the Eldar - and certainly the Aeldari of old - use seers to divine future outcomes, strike swiftly and decisively where they must, and withdraw without shame as soon as that is prudent. Their military technology reflects this spirit; mobility is emphasized over ability to sustain damage (though it would certainly not be beyond the Eldar to create more resilient armor if they so chose) and accuracy is emphasized in lieu of number of shots fired. Even Eldar titans use holofield displacement as a defefense in lieu of void shields, demonstrating a clear difference in solving similar problems.These are weapons of elegance and precision, not volume and senseless cacophony :You may have played missions like ‘secure and hold the objective for X number of turns.’ If you manage it, you win. But what does your army win when they hold out for five rounds against the Tyranids only to be wiped out - and the planet they’re on with it - in the rounds that would chronologically follow?So too it is with the Eldar who - in the age before the fall - would have seen any and all casualties reborn to live again. It’s like playing poker with infinite funds; not a real gamble. Wraithbone constructs can be remade, and warriors will be reborn. At that point you can focus your attention on the aesthetics of weapons and armor, pursuing lethal strife as a game , and the way of war as an intellectual pursuit.Thus Aeldari and Eldar technology is not just more advanced in terms of performance - a wraith cannon is well beyond humanity in terms of technical ability - but also in terms of how it is used, what it looks like, and as an extension of a cultural ideology instead of being just a mere tool.Humanity’s Dark Age of Technology meanwhile is a vague catch-all plot component to allow GW to continue to release new models without upsetting the technologically stagnant state of the Empire of Man in the 41st Millenium. Volkite weaponry for example, but also ‘new’ tanks like the grav tanks and Adeptus Custodes jet bikes, and indeed the Adeptus Custodes themselves.Finally, the Eldar supplement their tech with powerful psykic (Warhammer spelling) abilities this elevating their already impressive technological capabilities to even greater heights. In that respect humanity is simply biologically disadvantaged and chronologically behind the Eldar and certainly the Aeldari.",0 followers,Mark Stamp,663,3.2K,24.9M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Is-there-really-a-need-for-more-advanced-technologies-Why-or-why-not

9,Though many may disagree with my answer I would say that Humanity was the most technologically advanced. The reason is that most of the Eldars tech isn’t technology but rather an practical application of their psychic prowess. Waithbone? made by psychics. Shuriken weapons? Only functions using the any eldars psychic abilities. This goes on and on so while the Eldar were advanced it was due to their biology rather then technology.

One time we were required to corrupt product that had been shipped to China and it started a major debate about our fiduciary responsibility to the country or to the customer. The issue was that if you sell a security product that you know is corrupted, you are knowingly committing fraud and are liable. As the Product Manager at the time I asked the NSA if they would stand behind us (and me as I might be personally liable) in court if we were discovered. Of course the answer from the NSA was “Hell no.”We were on our own. We then entered into a long debate about how to detect Easter eggs and other corruption introduced into security products unknowingly through another vendor’s corrupted hardware. The issue was never resolved but it should be known that our security source code HAD to be provided to the NSA in order to get FIPS certification and they made certain changes to it.So to answer your question, USA military technology is advanced far beyond anyone’s knowledge to describe the extent.On the other hand, the Chinese probably know more about our technology than we do since they perpetrated the greatest security breach in history by compromising the RSA key technology used by almost everyone in the world.

Is Africa behind technologically?The issue is accessability and here we need to look at familiar things as econony, inequality, class, elite, allies, conflicting agendas etc.","17,554 followers",Supermodelsonya,2.7K,1.8K,14M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Is-there-really-a-need-for-more-advanced-technologies-Why-or-why-not
15,"TLDR - Sorry, I just realised that I haven't answered the question at all.Us non-Africans have to get better at looking at Africa. Africa is not an island wedged between Indian and Atlantic oceans. It's not Madagascar. It's not Seychelles. It's not Maldives. Africa is a very huge continent.Source: Google ImagesThere we go. Africa is HUGE.Now would we ask ourselves the question in context of a continent?Will the American continents someday become technologically advanced?That's too wide/generic a question to attract interesting answers.

16,"Anywhere can advance technologically if they have the will, intelligent, committed leaders with a desire to lift their country and who are able and willing to allow the people who can help to help regardless of race. Generally in Africa, Blacks are used in every position whether they can do the job or not. This would be racist in a western country of course, but not in Africa. A good example of this is South Africa, where the new minister of defence is a pre-school teacher who has never been in or near any military ever! Well she will know exactly what to do obviously!

A good example of this is South Africa, where the new minister of defence is a pre-school teacher who has never been in or near any military ever! Well she will know exactly what to do obviously! What this racism means is that African countries are generally run on a basis that promotes corruption and definitely means they never get to the questions like; “What is best for our people” or ‘Lets plan for technology and how we can promote it in our country”, nah, the only questions asked in South AFrica are “Where can I steal more” and “Why do starving children need food, its farmore importat that I can steal more” The ANC is of course a crime against humanity masquerading as a political party, but just look at Africa and, if you can get past the liberal nonsense about how colonialism destroyed Africa and can actually look rationally at the situation you will see the truth in what I say. South Africa has had the ANC in power for 27 years, in that time they coud have achieved a lot of positive things. Actually if they had just maintained the country as they were given it in 1994 it would have been fine, but instead they have stolen just about every spare cent the country had and have not maintained infrastructure, not maintained hospitals, schools, unversities, roads, take a look at once lovely cities like Kimberley, where the roads now have bigger pot holes than the actual big hole in Kimberley! It is sad, but while African governments see theft as their primary role, there will be no progress, technological or otherwise.","5,990 followers",Jens Böttiger,566,2.6K,17.6M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Is-there-really-a-need-for-more-advanced-technologies-Why-or-why-not
17,Basicly by allowing us to do/make more with less. More product per ton of material or hours of labor. More functionality per product.

18,"G’Day Onoja:- We can achieve much more in a shorter time. Saving time and doing tasks quicker, save money. Thereby, this is then passed into the general economy of a Country. We don’t have to work as long in doing the same tasks we did with pencil and paper. We now have more leisure time to enjoy paddling Kayaks and Surf Skis or Flip Flopping around the Snowy Mountains.","68,787 followers",Kanthaswamy Balasubramaniam,898,17.3K,413.5M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Is-there-really-a-need-for-more-advanced-technologies-Why-or-why-not
19,"Technological advance enables more productive activity. It does not determine it. Even when office computers were added in offices in the 1980s, productivity there did not increase much. It was only when offices were reorganized to take advantage of the abilities of office computers in the 1990s that office productivity improved drastically.Technology enables, but it is the humans who use it that must change their behaviors to adapt to the new environment that a technology allows, that determines the growth in productivity, and the wealth and happiness we get from that.","5,990 followers",Jens Böttiger,566,2.6K,17.6M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Is-there-really-a-need-for-more-advanced-technologies-Why-or-why-not

Joy of life!This constitutes a rise living standards in any Nation that has that science orientated education - to do good for it’s population - and spreading that menu to other Nation, cultures, and receiving in turn from others - which carries the entire world’s population into the future.An example: What the effects will be (not if) when there is a international health care system - and the primary standards constituting life - food, clean water, electricity, sanitation, transportation for all. If that had been done following the victory over the fascist in 1945 (which President Rosevelt had planed - but he died and his replacement rejected the Hamilton economic process that brought technology into being via using the Hamilton economic funding process but President Truman returned the U.S. to the Oligarch financial system headed by the British Empire depriving the world wide development that would have placed America on the moon a decade ahead of the actual event).International awareness that China has adopted the Hamilton process for the massive ‘checking’ of poverty within it’s population - actually elimination of 850 million of their people from poverty and bringing them, where possible, into the work force for the massive technologically oriented development - massive development that includes the increase of energy flux density for the participants (many in their now modern housing) that along with firing their creativity in problem solving has positioned China to rise in unprecedented development witnessed only by America’s rise into the the world’s industrial leader following the 100 Nations birthday in 1876 - due to the steel/railroad technology enhanced by the development of electrical sources which constituted the vast energy flux density of the labor force.Those forces that advocate war to ‘gather more wealth’ or contain others and rule over them, preventing the natural growth in people - the creativity in people. What is reflected in a nations “wealthiness” should reflect on what they are missing out on. Technology - a reflection - here in our species natural internal psychology - our soul that has the tendency to use the morality to do good, create in the culture that we are born into but ‘governed’ by the lawfulness of the universe we are a creation of - but a conscious factor of a developing universe - to go beyond that exists where born and the more ‘complete’ souls utilize their creative endeavors to bring a higher level of traveling into the future for all - with the increased if living standards, and thence abilities in investigations in technologies that enhance that process. - - The more people, the more creativity, the higher standards for life on this planet, and beyond - moving into a space age species - the coming era, thru harmonic cooperation between cultures, sovereign Nations understanding that governments can help direct that natural drive of our human species to create a future - and advanced future for our entire species.I post his as a more complete answer as to give a simple explanation that most “experts” miss - the more completeness of an answer that brings into the ‘reasons’ - a better picture - the true human elements of an answer that are usually never understood/internalized by the standard university graduated/degreed professional.
