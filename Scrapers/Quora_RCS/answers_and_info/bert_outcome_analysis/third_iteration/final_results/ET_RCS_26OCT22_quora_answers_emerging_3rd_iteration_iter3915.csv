And the way it happened historically was that, while significant advances happened in China, and then spread to Europe, the drive to really make something of them, and to push the entire society technologically forward, came from the competition between all the little European states with their petty agendas and, most especially, their wars. Regrettable, but arguable: the main driver of technology is war, and Europe simply had more of it.Actually, its not all that bad for historical Europe. Another development associated with all this rivalry and instability was that of liberty (and, less importantly in my view, democracy). And liberty too was a driver of technology. What China shows is that an unchallenged, self-sufficient, stable empire, thinks that the way things are done is the way they should be done. Progress is dangerous and needs to be suppressed. Liberty, on the other hand, means also liberty to try out the new. That, arguably, is what a single western empire would lack.",22 followers,Spencer McDaniel,2.1K,2.1K,61.5M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Is-Carbon-nano-technology-the-peak-of-our-technological-advancement

When we read about scientists it startles me that greeks scientists were still leading even in Roman era and many greek scientists contributed to mathematics especially in algebra during roman times. we dont hear a lot about Roman scientists.My opinion is, we define advancement of civilization based on what we see from the remains like the great roman baths, their drain system, their foru etc, but we dont see what is not apparent like scientific researches, the contribution of scientific knowledge, which romans heavily borrowed from the greeks and the rest of the world.We also dont see how most of the roman empire was monarchy as opposed to democratic system in ancient greece or the persians making slavery illegal in their constitution for the first time in the world, we dont see such advancement because its not apparent.Some user pointed towards china, which again is very misconceived, china was advanced in certain arts and made invented certain things like compass and paper and gun powder, but chinese didn’t have a concept of drain system like romans and indians had and the biggest shocker is chinese didn’t even have a concept of spherical earth like the greeks, romans and the indians, so to say china was advanced in a lot of things is a very big misconception and not to mention that chinese civil engineering lacked basic concept of brick construction well until the late 16th or 17th century gives a clue about the amount of advancement in chiense civilization.",912 followers,Élise Petras,789,1.3K,4.8M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Is-Carbon-nano-technology-the-peak-of-our-technological-advancement

9,"AsThe idea that the “Fall of Rome” was some great civilizational tragedy is a persistent and Eurocentric historical myth. Rome’s collapse was a process that took not decades butAsThe idea that the “Fall of Rome” was some great civilizational tragedy is a persistent and Eurocentric historical myth. Rome’s collapse was a process that took not decades butDestructionWhat did the Fall of Rome actually mean, then, for the part of the world that it did affect?First of all, it is true that the organizational structures of society changed quite a bit as a result of the fall of Rome. Whether they “regressed” (which is a very connotative word) or not is a matter of debate.Under the Roman Empire, which provided political unity and general security for those within Roman borders, it was possible to organize things on a large scale with less risk involved. For example, organizing a massive trading expedition was much easier and less risky when political borders were irrelevant, piracy was nonexistent, and every constituent trader in the trade fleet understood the mechanisms of a larger, unified economic system. The political disunity and lack of security that dominated the post-Roman world made all of these things far less certain.Organization also applied to things like administration and bureaucracy. Under Roman authority, it was possible for one political entity to centrally administer a massive area of land, dictate policy, and collect taxes. Without the unity of Roman authority, polities naturally fractured into smaller forms of organization. Armies represent the pinnacle of political, strategic, and logistical organization; when the capacity for all three was lost in the fall of Rome, the size and coherence of armies fell.Essentially, organization became smaller-scale, more haphazard, and more fluid. Things were no longer certain, as politics were changing by the day. Again, whether this was regression is up for debate and depends on whether you consider the organization of a massive empire a big achievement.Second of all, there wasn’t much technology lost in the fall of Rome. It wasn’t like all the technology was burned and destroyed by uncivilized barbarians and then no one had any technology anymore. No, they kept most of the stuff they had before under Roman authority and continued living their lives as normal.An argument can be made that a lot of knowledge was lost during the period we now call the Dark Ages (500–800). This makes sense; a lot of literature simply stopped proliferating or being copied beyond the halls of certain libraries and archives. Ancient authors, once widely accessible, were shelved away, and new literature was scarce. This is why we call the Dark Ages “dark:” because the literary source material is notably dry and scant.But there is no argument that technology backpedaled. In fact, technology actually improved at a rapid pace during the Dark Ages.The prosperity of the Roman economic system, as well as the institution of slavery, collaborated to bring technological stagnation. Hardly any new technological innovations were implemented in any field from the years 200–500 CE. This is what I always point out to people who compare Rome to our modern world: our idea of prosperity is one of progress, advancement, and change, while theirs was one of stability and preservation of theProgress, however, came when it was necessary. Farmers needed better methods to feed themselves without the international trade networks of the Roman era, so they implemented three-field crop rotation and created heavy plows drawn by teams of oxen to till deeper into the soil and access more nutrients for better crop yields. Slaves no longer provided cheap and easy labor, so water mills and windmills were built. Metallurgy improved.Quality of life dropped off immediately after the fall of Rome, but due to technological and methodological advancements, it improved and eventually surpassed the quality of life during the peak of Rome’s prosperity. The high Medieval Era, which came during a warm climate optimum period, saw the improved crop yields of the Dark Ages fuel another great population boom. Commerce on a large scale over long distances was reestablished, great civil engineering and architecture came back, and vast forests were finally cleared, both to provide for construction needs and for farmland.The Dark Ages were not a period of chaos and regression. That is too simple of a characterization. Many things improved during the Dark Ages, most notably technology. The poor conditions of the post-Roman era gave the people an incentive to innovate, and so they did.Organizationally, things became simpler and smaller-scale because people felt less secure and unwilling to trust. Technologically, things progressed far more than they had under the stagnant Roman era.",UNKNOWN,Tim O'Neill,673,657,10.8M,2020,https://www.quora.com/If-the-Roman-empire-had-lasted-at-least-as-powerful-and-united-as-it-was-at-its-peak-by-the-2nd-century-AD-until-today-would-the-human-technology-be-several-centuries-more-advanced

What happened was that they became available to everyone.So what will be the next thing that has existed for decades that will change our lives completely?
