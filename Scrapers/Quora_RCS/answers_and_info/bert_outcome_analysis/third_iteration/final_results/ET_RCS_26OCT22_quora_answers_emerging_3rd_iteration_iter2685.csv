1,Most governments around the world if they are competent have contingency planning for pretty much EVERYTHING even unlikely stuff.I remember at the end of Blair’s regime in the UK. The UK government revealed that they had plans for first contact with extra terrestrial aliens.Why would the Chinese government… a government pretty much composed of engineers NOT have a plan for such things?,1 follower,Walter Zhou,900,87,280.1K,2020,https://www.quora.com/How-did-Chinese-civil-engineers-have-enough-time-to-design-the-Wuhan-emergency-hospital-building-given-that-it-was-built-finished-within-9-days-What-kind-of-advanced-technology-did-China-use-to-build-with-such

3,"Let’s focus only on the technical challenges. For the civil/ structural engineer, the challenge is to design a large structure within a day at the very maximum.

Floor-to-floor height has to accommodate AC ducting, electrical, plumbing, oxygen and NO gas pipes, etc. as well as structural depth. Make it conservative. Add 1 foot for luck, because there’s no time to make any changes if someone needs a bigger duct.The structural design also has to be conservative. Floor load of 3 kPa? Take 5 kPa and go ahead, again because there’s no way anyone can change anything if you find that a heavy load has to come up on a floor that’s already being precast.While the architectural/ structural design is going on, the electrical, HVAC, plumbing, firefighting and other services are also doing their design, again conservatively and as simply as possible.Hence, the secret is conservatism, over-design and simplicity. An emergency project isn’t the place for you to demonstrate how light and economical your design can be, nor for the architect to show off his flights of aesthetic fancy.","23,887 followers",Robin Daverman,11.8K,2.3K,40.1M,2020,https://www.quora.com/How-did-Chinese-civil-engineers-have-enough-time-to-design-the-Wuhan-emergency-hospital-building-given-that-it-was-built-finished-within-9-days-What-kind-of-advanced-technology-did-China-use-to-build-with-such

I suspect they have minimal medical amenities, more like a clinic, since the majority of people who catch the virus will recover with just simple supportive care.

The Minoan are very good at both disciples as you’ll see.There is a lot of technology on display in this fresco! Firstly, those ships over 10 oars are white with one exception that seems to be copper coming from the inner caldera port. A team reproduced a half-scale model of one of these ships, constructed the hull from wooden planks using strong mortise and tenon joints. This construction method was used by the later Phoenicians but fell largely out of use and there is evidence of technology transfer to Phoenicia forThe hull is then sealed by overlaying a linen cloth and heated pine resin (a natural polymer) infused with limestone powder to make the hull white. This is the first example of a composite which would not be seen again until 1950CE with the introduction of glass-reinforced plastic (GRP). Technically linen cloth is almost as strong in tension as glass-fibre! Close inspection of the interior shows that in at least one case this was applied internally (to the copper ship), in blue, which suggests lapis lazuli powder used instead (expensive, no expense spared on what may be the rulers ship in the precession to Delos, which seems to be implied by the lion figure).Copper fillings may have been applied externally, the significance of this is that barnacles will not attach, it’s copper-bottomed. A technique the Royal Navy used much later in history, it dramatically improves hydrodynamic performance by reducing drag as the hull doesn’t have barnacles. Fishing vessels to this day, anchor in the Theran Caldara to clean the hull as there is copper in the rock formations.This reinforcement would allow for a lighter stronger hull and have had a huge benefit if the ship is caught on an outcrop of rocks just below the waterline (a risk at this time, note that a staff protrudes from the rear of ships to release a lead weight on a line to identify depth at sea to the sea floor), although the timbers will be compromised the inner linen will delaminate from the hull and keep the hull sufficiently watertight to make landfall and repair, saving the ship, crew and cargo. The artist really goes out of his way to point all this out, there is a sense of look at this and this, it is superb teaching aid, they are explaining the theory to their children. A half-scale modern-day reproduction (N.B. the fresco suggest freestanding mast).The technology doesn't just stop there, these ships are pack with simple and effective technology. Anemometers for winds speed and direction: devices on the bow on wires that deflect in the wind, bells to give an audible indication of wind intensity to the entire crew. We know from archaeology and written accounts that they had lodestones likely from magnetite (iron) from Skyros struck by lightning, Minoan buildings are aligned to magnetic North from around 1800BCE. Landbased compass, Crete 1650BCE, the sub markings give the fractional (1/total to express the angle) and therefor the declination to true North. When this compass was made there is a large change in the magnetic field and it appears that the Palace are studying this, likely to inform the merchant fleet of the changes in declination. This is ‘Earth science’.Labrys eventually lead to the Jacob’s staff (a marine sextant), the transfer to Phoenicia can be shown, with this one can establish latitude for passage across the high sea without hugging the coastline.Caged natural birds are likely being used to estimate longitude as they face towards their home port. Minoan iconography shows them on the Labrys tips and represents the West and East cardinal directions and longitudinal, the four minoan deities almost certainly represent seasons and cardinal directions. Hunting birds for those associated with Autumn (West) and doves for the Spring (east) sailing seasons. All of these technologies are not centuries ahead of their time but Millenium! It is the reason birds are often shown on on maritime iconography and bow and stern posts, longitude is hard, birds have mastered it to migrate with the seasons (they explain a quantum effect of light as a wave and a particle), I’m not suggesting they understood Quantum physics, rather they understood that birds have this ability to hone to their home port and exploit it.This is one technology that may be lost in Antiquity. Minoan technology is superbly simple and hugely capable: reverse stroke weight assisted propulsion.Not even Leonardo realised this, who was specifically trying to harness human power for flight and realised that human strength is the opposite to that of birds, human power is in the leg with the most muscle mass. The apparatus shown above uses alternative push strokes (only) for each leg, not push AND pull for both. How to harness human power…Consider the oar arrangement. It's unusual, two lines are shown to each oar which is shown mid-hulled. For completeness, I should flag up that some have speculated that the oarsman are paddling. I think this unlikely as pottery models of Minoan vessels survive and have oars protruding mid-hull.This would suggest the ships are larger than once thought and the oarsman are sat entirely within the hull. Then what are these two lines? The artists goes to some lengths to point out all the technology. Ropes being set forward of the oarsman may be shown that could be connected to weights. In this way, the oarsman which face rear, pull up the weight upon the return stroke, which they enjoy on the pull stroke for additional propulsive force. Continous work being performed and temporarily stored as by the weight. This also counterbalances the weight of the oar itself. Minoan dynamics are likely very good, they are accounts of early machines, those that ‘walk’ down the street - lacking the vocabulary for locomotion, statues that move using mechanical arrangements (pulleys) to the fascination of the audience and a door that opened by fire (steam).There seems to be an undulating raised section between oars and the oars protrude through the hull. This is quite an important principle to establish, if the oars are set below the line of the hull, the ships are larger than thought and more seaworthy.This arrangement would give maximum intercept speed when required. It is difficult to say conclusively that this arrangement is being used, however what maybe ropes are possibly being employing, the question is how and why? To maximise propulsive force seems like it would be something they would wish to do. The oar arrangements are curious and more archaeological evidence needs to be established for how the Minoans were undertaking such long voyages at this time, the issue is there no complete example of a Minoan ship which survives.Why would they wish to realise higher speed? Minoans may wish to identify any non-Minoan vessel over ten oars in their waters to levy duty. Peak Sanctuaries are on mountain tops throughout the Cyclades have a commanding view of the coastal approaches and their waters (Minos is accredited with the first Navy and suppressing piracy in the region). Peak sanctuaries typically have greater than 100kms line of sight to the horizon, from a ship's deck only 3kms by comparison. They have labrys which are huge copper mirrors that could have been used to signal fleet to intercept (which requires dash speed), board, inspect cargo and potentially levy duty. The Iliad explains that the news of the fall of Troy was communicated by island beacon fires from Troy (right) to Argos (far left) within hours using fires (signals) and seems to be a mature technology.Carian marines are shown on point on merchant ships and all the passengers have helmets to hand, as shown in another fresco in the same room! Which also shows Carians being paid in head of herd by the islands at a festival to Apollo, as per the legendary founding of Delos, build a temple to mighty Apollo and they will bring hecatomb (hundreds) of head of herd.This technology is not slightly better, it is hugely ahead of its time. The Minoans are so very organised. If the Minoans are policing the shipping lanes using peak sanctuaries to co-ordinate the fleet, there isn’t anything this well co-ordinated untilWhy did this technology fall out of use you may ask? The Minoans didn’t give away their advantages, they had a practical monopoly on the metal trade in the Mediterranean, no other civilisation could undertake high sea navigation at this time. The Minoan civilisation suffered many disasters, first the eruption of Thera that took out the entire Minoan fleet (1628BCE), then a civil war with the Carians (that provided soldiers and crew to Minos, shown above, around 1500BCE but were driven out of the islands, their name comes from where they settled, Caria in Anatolia), then Myceanea gained control of the islands (1400BCE) and finally, bronze age collapse, ca. 1200BCE. Death by a thousand cuts gradually weakening this trading thalassocracy, it did rebuild but was a shadow of its former self, producing huge surplus being a low priority when feeding the island population will have become the priority.In their heyday, they must have held sway as many city-states required metals (such as copper and tin) to develop and make tools. There is a sense of this in some of the later Greek text. Minoan ships brought to port the metals and exchange surplus for the other things they needed to develop. The Phoenicians largely pickup and eventually re-established the trade network after bronze age collapse, but it may have been Minoan technology (labrys and lodestones for high sea navigation and murex purple dye production, which was developed on Crete), the later gave them a valuable commodity to trade for metals that allowed the Phoenicians to expand. The legend of Theseus (founder of Athens) is telling, the 30 oar ship he returned from Crete in took pride of place, it was on display as a trophy for many generations until it eventually rotted away. It doesn’t appear Athens knew how to build these ships (they were likely made by Minoan Palace controlled shipyards) or understood what the significants of equipment on-board was, it does not appear to be adopted or could be reproduced.What can be inferred is that the ruling family of Athens wanted to learn how the Minoans were acquiring such wealth, on his return Theseus went to Skyros where magnetite is available (iron, the most valuable metal of the Bronze age and if struct by lightning giving a lodestone to navigate at sea), his negotiations were not successful with the islanders, he was thrown off a cliff.How good was Minoan technology? I think likely exceptional. No Minoan papyrus survive, that will have likely included codex on Astronomy, Nature (physics), instrumentation and engineering practice. The archaeology record, suggests it could have been superlative, we see the outputs of astronomy (accurate astronomical periods shown in jewellery and frescos); Newton is accredited with the development of the prism but precision ground rock-crystals prisms are found in aThis seal shows compass dividers are being used with grinding bits of 60 micrometres (0.06mm) and placement precision of within 15 micrometres (0.015mm), comparable to that of many CNC machine steps of today (but not specialist precision machines).Zoomed in section of hairline, 1mm sq, note the milling bit holes not worked out with literally a needle file used elsewhere. I think we can forgive them this oversight, you can’t even see it without optical magnification.A thought experiment, could Daedulus have pulled off a glider to outrun a white-hull? They had no other choice if they want to leave Crete and passage at ports is denied, the peak sanctuaries can send ships to intercept and nothing moves from the port without a palace seal! They need something fast and ideally a platform that cannot be stopped. Necessity is the mother of invention. I have built experimental aircraft for the Ministry of Defence, I could build a glider easily with known Minoan technology.It’s not so difficult if you build models and study nature (griffon vulture show how to circle on the sunny side of a hill with their fixed position top wings), a wicker frame is easy (this is used for composite shields which are fabously light weight) and Icarus invented the sail or more likely the coating to preserve the sail, he got as far as Icaria according to mythology and where he had his mishap, 200kms from Crete by island-hopping around 50 kms to obtain the next thermal around 3kms altitude is needed with a 20:1 sink rate, Daedalus seems to have made it to Troy to obtain passage elsewhere. Minos setting a challenge that only he could solve to find him.A bronze from Samos ca 700BCE, sometime after Daedulus but may be much closer to what was used for airwork, an elliptical 7m span wicker fixed-wing frame with underslung wicker handrails, skinned with linen sailcloth and sealed and a linen fantail the legs being splade. The most simple airframe it could possibly be.Just maybe…Minoan technology is so very simple but hugely capable, they study nature, model before scaling up (and if they produce hand launch models that glide straight and true, then scaled up and started on the side of a hill until they learn flight control, they stood a very good chance of pulling this off), a 50:50 chance according to mythology. By keeping it simple you produce an elliptical fixed-wing with wicker frame (like birds), have both weight shift control and control surfaces using the leg, it could not be simpler and will hugely outperform the sink rate of a modern-day handglider! They have no less than what Sir George Cayley had and arguably more practical experience of building lightweight structures (shields), sails used for flight surfaces and fluid dynamics generally from ships. Flight in ca 1450BCE is as significant as putting a man on the moon, if they had not, maybe the accepted early flight pioneers would have never attempted this and without that there is no moon landing, no satellites or international travel.

It is often the unseen tools to make these artefacts that are more impressive than the artefact themselves, a calliper is hugely important for standardisation, engineering and geometry. A seal of this precision would not be seen again until some time after the age of enlightenment. Its detail is comparable with early banknote plates (around the C18th CE). The section below is approximately 10mm in view size.No, these optical lenses…Similar dating, Mount Ida, Crete, ca 1400 BCE, however, this may be when the lenses were stored in the Caves of Minos. Made from precision ground rock-crystal (natural glass), see what I mean, with a dividing compass (callipers) one can create an arc to create a lens and critically measure the arc to improve; in this case: optics.Hang on a minute, maybe these white-hulled ships…Santorini (Thera) before the eruption of 1628 BCE. The reconstruction team thought they used flax linen cloth in pine resin (a natural thermoplastic) with limestone powder to make the hull white (a composite matrix) over a wooden frame. The reinforcement is shown inside and out, if the hull is compromised on rocks, it will delaminate, keeping the hull watertight to make landfall and repair, saving the crew, ship and cargo. Glass fibre composites were invented in 1950’s COMMON ERA. Flax is almost as strong in tension.No this…Later bronze casting currently in the Met Museum, NY, ca 700 BCE from originally Samos, Greece. It's the closest thing I’ve seen to what Daedalus’ glider may have been. An airframe! If the fabled account of Icarus is correct: the remains of his glider were found at IcariaWe have little idea of what technology the Minoan’s really had, most of it has decayed and is lost to time. The Athenians kept the white hull ship Theseus returned in, it was on display for centuries as a trophy of Athens increasing power. According to myth, Theseus tried to secure magnetite and got thrown off a cliff on Skyros, a source of Magnetite! Athens didn’t know how to make another white-hull, they fell out of use, it is sufficiently advanced that they were unable to reproduce it.A communication network across the Aegean? Well, they had one according to Homer, the fall of Troy was reported to Argos in a few hours using island fire beacons (Peak Sanctuaries which have line-of-sight between them and are present throughout the entire Aegean), e.g. a message relayed at a few hundred miles per hour using long-distance signals, fires at night, gravity cast flat mirrors called Labyrs (double-axe) in the day.Peak sanctuary above. Note all the measuring devices!Kit checkBlind embossing printing: Check. Money (Palace gold tokens): Check. Sewers, flushing toilets, interlocking clay pipes with injectors to remove debris, aqueducts, tunnels straight through mountains, hot and cold running water to upper stores. Check, check, check, check, check and check. Are you getting dizzy? All of these things are technically demonstrated in the mid second millennium before common era and were (largely) lost in Bronze Age collapse to be rediscovered often centuries and in some rare cases many millennia later.The fingers. The (Idaean) Dactyls:What is shown above is miltech from the Bronze Age and it makes advanced research agencies of today look like they are playing at it! We should have been on the moon at the beginning of the common era on this trajectory. An enlightenment had already happened before the common era, then an island erupted (1628 BCE), then the Mycenaeans invaded (1450 BCE), then Bronze Age Collapse (1225 BCE): the world had gone very badly wrong and took a different course…What can we not understand about Minoans?And if its prehistory, this…Oldest obsidian bracelet reveals amazing craftsmen's skills in the eighth millennium BCA short time after this, this…“Bird-man”. A count of the days of the year is shown in the background and confirm on the count shown on the entwined snakes!Make no mistake this artifact is MORE significant than the Antikythera mechanism.

Speculative on my part, but the four suns may be recording an Olympiad to add a leap month to keep the lunar and solar calendar aligned and the nine suns (years) anA shared cultural heritage; the fingers (Dactyls), the makers.Measure human, measure! The boss, is the thumb: Herakles (position), and likely the artist is referred to this on the first seal, the only people that would realize this are those with a lens inspecting the seal!This is all hidden in plain sight. The Dactyls are the Quartermasters to those perceived as Gods. They made the tools, machines, weapons and systems. One hand is male, the other female. They built the most extraordinary things: transformative technology and systems.Administration may be the glue of civilization, but it is the technology that increases efficiency and with that increased output. Without technology, we would never be able to support such truly huge populations of today and we would otherwise still be living in the stone age, all 7 million of us; three orders of magnitude difference to the actual population of today: 7 billion and counting.These technologies (particularly the old ones) are critical enablers: calendars, machines and platforms to facilitate increased trade in surpluses giving prosperity.

Fundamentally different to common reactors use for many decades. Only China is developing Gen 4 Fission reactor prototypes. Not needing very high pressure water in the reactor core.China has obtained advanced US nuclear technology, research and designs that have been ignored by the US government. So China will soon be ahead of the US in reactor technology. China is building a variety of the worlds best nuclear reactor designs as well as developing their own.Gen 4 reactors are a vital option needed for low carbon energy. While many people are against nuclear energy it remains the world's major source of low carbon energy. In France, it provides 70% of its energy. China and India will be building over 50 nuclear power plants.The world's energy needs are growing rapidly due to growth in populations, wealth, industry, economies, trade and transport. There is no guarantee that renewable energy will be able to keep up with growing demand. So we need many more options for low carbon energy. Building Gen 4 prototype reactors may provide us with vital, low carbon energy options.And despite the lack of enthusiasm from many people many countries are still planning to develop nuclear power. And if the US does not want to sell safe nuclear reactor designs then other countries, including Russia and China are willing to sell them.Gen 4 reactors have built in features for self-regulation and prevention of over heating and potential meltdowns. meltdowns. But they can not be developed further without the construction of working prototype reactors. To prove there safety and capabilities.China has built and is now running a Gen 4 gas-cooled test reactor using pebble bed fuel. And is building a MSR, Molten Salt Reactor prototype and developing a TWR, Travelling Wave Reactor. Due to government restrictions, the US partner for the TWR reactor has pulled out of the partnership. President Nixon cancelled the US MSR reactor project in the 70s for political reasons. And most of the research was destroyed.The main US nuclear companies are invested in current reactor technology and the income they get for the production of expensive, enriched Uranium fuel rods that need replacement every 2 years. Producing large amounts of large amounts of nuclear fuel waste. With most of the enriched Uranium being wasted.So the developers of Gen 4 reactors in the US are mostly small start-up companies that see the importance of this technology. And opposition to Gen 4 reactors is supported by the rich, US, oil, coal and gas industries that have powerful political lobby groups. So it is very difficult to develop this technology in the US. A major reason for US companies wanting to work with China.","68,796 followers",Kanthaswamy Balasubramaniam,898,17.3K,413.6M,2020,https://www.quora.com/How-did-Chinese-civil-engineers-have-enough-time-to-design-the-Wuhan-emergency-hospital-building-given-that-it-was-built-finished-within-9-days-What-kind-of-advanced-technology-did-China-use-to-build-with-such
