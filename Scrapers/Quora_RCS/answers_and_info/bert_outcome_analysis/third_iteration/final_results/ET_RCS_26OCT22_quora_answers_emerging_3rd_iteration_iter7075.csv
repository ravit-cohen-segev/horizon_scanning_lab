I thought it's fine it might be a printing mistake, but when I went to the starting of the book it said2006 :-revised2007:-reprint2008:-reprint…..2017:-reprint.So for the past twelve years no one corrected the book. It's been like this for the pastWhat's wrong with our education system you ask?Our text books are outdated and no one wants to update the syllabus.

So inIn 1947 when Brits left India..they has left a highly divided & poor nation on caste ..social ..economic & religious lines. Please read ‘Brits looted India left & right …destroyed the social fabric of India to the core.It will tell how cunning..devious Brits were..on top of it India was socially & religiously destroyed by successive invaders since 1550.( This is for some other time why & how)When Congress took over reins of India in 1947 ..it was very trying & challenging times for Nehru & Patel. So initial 15–17 years till his death Nehru tried his best to navigate the nation and he was a big proponent of secular values ( may be the times were tough when millions of Hindus & Muslims were killed during unfortunate partition) so probably being secular was most prudent at that point of time.. deep scars of Millions of Hindu & Muslims killings were still fresh in minds & Psyche of Indians. India was in throes of multiple challenges ..on multiple fronts.Its very easy to blame & find shortcomings of a leader after 50 years he passed away..how any other leader would have dealt in same situation is a million dollar question and open to all kinds of permutation & combinations.To his all faults of Nehru ( there are many many) ..he gave India a steady & secure start with industrial framework with social moorings..many PSU in different sectors ( that was the only option may be)...IIT..IIM’s ..a good foundation of science & technology..ISRO..IISC’s..NITs..polytechnic ..ITI’s.To me that was probably right at that point of time..looking into social upheaval..brittle social fabric..very weak private enterprise..huge diversity of language and beliefs and DEEP scars of partition .Things actually began to slide down with Indira Gandhi in powerRajiv was a big mistake a PM ..and this lead to family dynasty in congress ( Indira was also daughter of Nehru and but she was not given things on platter like Rajiv).Than we had Narasimha Rao..he steadied India for good 5 years in deep economic problems..than we had Atal Bihari Vajpayee ..he consolidated what Rao did ..his thought process & vision was closely aligned to Nehru( Gujral..VP singh..Gowda..Chandrasekhar were just fillers)..than we have Manmohan singh for 10 years he was just holding the fort at best with many corruption allegations & perception of policy paralysis..not the best of times for Indian polity.Now we have Modi as PM and to my mind he probably knows India much more than many past PM’s ( at par or close to Nehru) and Modi has a vision & a long term view of country like Nehru had . ( Many may disagree with Modi’s vision & long term view for India but no one can deny he does not have vision). Has the political will to bring in systematic change.I will stick my neck say that if NEHRU was the founder & builder of India ..Modi probably will be remembered as Consolidator of 21st century India if he gets another term in 2019.So lets see how people of India judge Modi in 2019..,"242,291 followers",Roman Saini,957,315,33.4M,2018,https://www.quora.com/How-can-we-improve-technology-in-India

By splitting the question I get a frame of reference and then the answer becomes fairly straight forward to comprehendThe answer to the first question is straight forward and India is much advanced compared to where we were in 2000. I am not going to elaborate this further because its for us to see. But should we be happy about it? That leads us to my second questionWhile it is true that India has advanced immensely in the last 20 years, the real question is has this made us more dependent on other countries? Most notably the United States and recently China?Despite having a population of 1.3 billion people and being touted as the software superpower (thanks to the IT services industry) not so long ago, India does not have self-reliance when it comes to technology. China created companies like Ali Baba, Baidu and Tencent a parallel to the American tech giants while India (even India’s telecom minister recently) takes pride in being the largest consumer of Whatsapp, and Facebook! Yes almost everyone has a mobile phone in India today and therefore the opportunities for growth is tremendous. But the real question one should ask is, who will be the beneficiaries of these opportunities? The mobile phones used in India are Chinese phones and the software used in these phones are U.S owned. Basically all our data, from our shopping habits to our entertainment preferences are in the hands of foreign technology companies. Now we know IoT is catching up fast and that means more control to these companies and India will be a proud consumer supplying data.One of the many important aspects discussed in Rajiv Malhotra’s latest book “Artificial Intelligence and the Future of Power, Five Battlegrounds” is India’s military dependence on foreign technology. While the manufacturing of Rafale jets will happen in India, the technology is owned by the French and let’s understand when such technology transfers occur between countries, the supplying country will always provide a technology that is one generation behind to the consuming country. That means we are technologically and militarily advanced compared to our previous generations but we are at least one generation behind the innovating countries! In certain areas like military that is not good newsMy last point on this is our pride in our Human resource and how skilled we are! Yes as individuals many Indians are CEOs of big foreign tech giants. But how does that benefit India as a nation? Do we have a stake in the intellectual property of these products? Can we say for instance Sunder Pichai as Google’s CEO holds the same clout in his company as Mark Zuckerberg holds in Facebook? Certainly not! Let’s not confuse individual brilliance with technological advancement as nation.For India to have a grand standing in the world stage as a technologically advanced nation, we need to come out of our consumer mindset and to quote Rajiv Malhotra’s words “be producers of knowledge and technology”.","246,865 followers",Dushka Zapata,1.5K,8.5K,232.5M,2021,https://www.quora.com/How-can-we-improve-technology-in-India
4,"Not in the sense that Tesla have it.Almost 100% of “self driving” features in vehicles that either exist or are planned within the next 5 years have onlyNot in the sense that Tesla have it.Almost 100% of “self driving” features in vehicles that either exist or are planned within the next 5 years have onlyRivian has at least the first two of those - but so do a lot of modern cars. It’s nothing to write home about - although it’s still pretty neat.THE EXCEPTION BEING TESLA:Those three (increasingly standard) up-market features areADVANCED CRUISE CONTROL - THE TESLA WAY:A Tesla can do all of the usual “advanced cruise control” things - but it can also automatically stop at red traffic lights and STOP signs. It slows down at school zones - it slows down if the line of traffic next to it is moving very slowly for some reason - it lets other cars come in front of it if they indicate that they will do so - and will slow down rapidly is someone cuts in front without indicating.It uses a combination of maps and visually looking for speed limit signs - so if there are no obvious road signs - it’ll use whatever Google Maps says the speed limit is - but if it sees an actual speed limit sign - it’ll obey that instead (handy when there are temporary speed limits).So this is kinda like the feature that other cars have - but SO much more refined. There is really almost no need to ever use the gas and brake pedals with this level of sophistication.AUTOMATIC STEERING - THE TESLA WAY:A Tesla can (for example) overtake other cars automatically - so you’re going down a freeway in the righthand lane and there is a slow moving semi-truck ahead. My car will indicate left - wait for a gap in the traffic - steer itself into the next lane - and once it’s passed the semi- it’ll indicate right - wait for a gap and steer back into the original lane. You have options you can set if you want it to ask you to confirm that it can change lanes - or that it will continuously find which lane has traffic that’s moving closest to your speed and move into that one and stay there until a better option shows up. It even knows which roads have a “Right lane for overtaking only” rule - and obeys that. It can also change lanes to avoid road works - slow down a little to allow another car to move into your lane. It can merge onto a freeway or off of it.SELF-PARKING - THE TESLA WAY:A Tesla can parallel park or right-angle park for you - just like many others - all without help. It’ll also drive itself into or out of your garage without you sitting inside the car at all! (You use your cellphone to tell it to do it). If you buy the optional garage door opener it’ll even handle opening and closing the door all by itself.But this isWhat my car can do is nothing short of astounding.I can be 200 feet away from the car in a busy parking lot - and (using my phone) tell it to come and pick me up. The car starts up - shows me the route it plans to take on a map on my phone - then pulls out of the parking space - follows it’s planned route through the lines of cars to get to me. Stops for other cars and pedestrians and can steer around stray shopping carts, etc - until it arrives five feet away from me and honks to tell me it’s OK.This is just *SO* far beyond what any other car on the planet can do. When you watch it do things like slowing down for a speed bump - or giving way to another car - it’s just like a very careful human was driving it.BUT…COMING SOON!There are about a bazillion (roughly) YouTube videos from the lucky few who got early access to the latest Tesla software - which has been promised for Xmas 2020.Since we can see it working “for real” - the speculation as to whether this feature will be here in 2020 (as promised) is over.This new software be uploaded automatically into every car that has the Full Self Driving feature - sometime around Xmas 2020.What it now allows you to do is to tell the car where you want to drive to…and it’ll do ALL of the work…everything. Driving out of a parking lot, driving across a busy city, along freeways or country roads - all the way to your destination. Traffic signals with turn arrows, 4-way stops, roundabouts, unprotected left turns, one-way streets, pedestrians (even not at crossings), bicycles…no problem!All you have to do is remain alert and ready to take over if there is some kind of problem…which from what I’m seeing with the latest version (Nov 29th) is now pretty rare.This is 10 years ahead of what any other car company can do - and 5 years ahead of what experimental systems like Waymo, Apple and Uber are playing with…and works on cheap hardware, not trunk-sized computers with LIDAR detectors. Just 8 cheap cameras and a radar unit.It’s going to need (probably) another year or two of refinement and a change in the law - but we are within sight of a car that will let you sit in the back seat - and fall asleep while it drives.CONCLUSIONS:We are very close to the point now where you don’t even have to ask:“Will <company X> have self driving?”The answer is:Unless the company is Tesla - then:These differences aren’t even close.",3 followers,Steve Baker,514,27.4K,163.4M,2021,https://www.quora.com/How-can-we-improve-technology-in-India
5,"Well, it depends on PRECISELY what you mean by “self-driving”.My Tesla Model 3 has the “full-self-driving” package - and every couple of weeks, it edges a little closer to actually being able to do that.As of today (Nov 2020):Well, it depends on PRECISELY what you mean by “self-driving”.My Tesla Model 3 has the “full-self-driving” package - and every couple of weeks, it edges a little closer to actually being able to do that.As of today (Nov 2020):If the law changed today, it could drive on divided highways without your help.But City Streets are a much harder problem.The good news is that there are a bunch of people who have been given the very latest version of the software to test out BEFORE it’s released to everyone else. This is the so-called “beta” release.This version really does automate city driving…it can be told “Drive me to WalMart - and it’ll pretty much be able to do that without you having to do anything.So before we get to FULLY self driving cars, we need three things…in this order:Once we get to that point - you should be able to sit in your car, tell it “Take me to work” - and then fall asleep for the next half hour while it does it.I can’t say when the law will change - politics are hard to predict - but the technology will be ready by - maybe - July 2021.[[UPDATE]]Here we are in October 2021, and the Full Self Driving on city streets pre-release software is now being opened up to everyone who paid for it - if they can prove themselves to be capable of monitoring the software safely. So in about 6 days from now, we should have a lot more people able to test this software (hopefully, I’ll be one of them).After some (unspecified) test period, this software will be released unconditionally to the people who paid for it already.This slow and careful release procedure is a good thing because of the potential dangers of self-driving cars.By gradually increasing the number of people who have it as confidence in the reliability of the software increases, Tesla are doing the responsible thing to minimize risks of accidents.",0 followers,Thomas Kolb,1.3K,575,4.9M,2021,https://www.quora.com/How-can-we-improve-technology-in-India

Driving 5mph over the speed limit - as I’d instructed it to do. Sometime later, we were overtaking trucks and other cars, at speeds of about 75 to 80 mph. The car drove through roadworks - changing lanes to be in the correct lane.As we approached El Paso, the car turned off of the freeway, then left onto the TransMountain highway - then through city streets for about 15 minutes until it arrived at the address I had told it to drive to.It did this without me having to steer, use the gas pedal or the brake - or even the turn signals.My only responsibility (because the law demands it) was to remain alert, in case the car needed help (it did not)- and to rest one hand gently on the steering wheel - just in case.So - we can definitively state that “Self-driving cars have now happened”.We have self-driving cars.

Then I would also provide a gist of technologies which can be used to become a Blockchain developer.ConceptsTo sum this section up, Blockchain is any decentralized network which supports aforementioned characteristics.Now that we have a basic broad explanation of Blockchain, we can move on to the topic of development.When Bitcoin was launched, the underlying technology wasn’t much explored. But as the interest grew, experts started looking at the architecture which supported bitcoins. An analysis quickly revealed that this architecture had far reaching potential. To put it in simple words, Bitcoin is to Blockchain, what Email was to Internet. Sure it is one very important application of it, it is not the only possible application. And Blockchain is touted to be Internet 2.0 .To explore such potential, a lot of new development technologies have come up. Let’s talk about some of them.There are a few other technologies too, like IOTA, Lisk, Interledger but they can be handled later on a need to know basis.My advice would be to stay away from generic explanations about Blockchain and start with one of these technologies and dive into development. Not that those explanations aren’t good, but they don’t serve a lot of purpose when it comes to Blockchain development.
