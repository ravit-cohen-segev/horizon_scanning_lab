Any society with the kinds of quantities of salt needed to just keep its members alive would, if it were at all advanced, have learned enough about chemistry to isolate the salt and have it as a distinct substance that could be studied.Without any access to metals except in trace amounts, such as the iron in hemoglobin, it’s hard to see how they’ll be able to build experimental devices and learn the ropes of physics.

But that would not mean that the machine would have to be able reflect on its own actions, ponder its place in the world, or cleave to any values unrelated to preserving human life through the provision of food, water, healthcare for everyone living in areas that it controls.   The machine might have no inclination to transgress.   It might not even qualify as a moral agent, i.e. a being at least some of whose actions can be intelligibly characterized as morally right or morally wrong.So when we are talking about an AI in connection to its moral responsibilities, we are not talking about just any AI that can out-think a human being;   we are talking about only a subset of such devices that perform (at least) the same mental tasks that humans perform, such as assigning moral responsibility.   Knowing right from wrong, in the same sense that a human being does, would make the machine a moral agent.It's the analogy between humans and AI's-that-qualify-as-moral-agents that facilitates some off-the-cuff preliminary answers to your question.Your Question:    The answer is ""no.""   There are no human beings who have the responsibility to reproduce their intellects.   With a world population of seven billion people and climbing, it's hard to argue that people have the responsibility to reproduce at all.One can imagine a scenario in reproduction were morally obligatory for all people capable of doing so.   See, for example, the infertility plague scenario in the movie, ""Children of Men.""The same cannot be said of a the purported responsibility to eliminate all of one's mentally weaker predecessors.   We do not have an obligation to eliminate our elderly and mentally infirm parents--in fact, doing so is generally forbidden.    If Homo Erectus had survived to the present day (by no means an impossible scenario according to the late evolutionary biologist & paleontologist Stephen Jay Gould), we would not have an obligation to exterminate that species.   In fact, such genocide would be condemned as morally repugnant in most countries.Since there is no reason for a human to take on the purported responsibilities mentioned in your question, there is no reason for an AI to do so either.","5,990 followers",Jens Böttiger,566,2.6K,17.6M,2016,https://www.quora.com/If-AI-could-create-simulates-on-how-advanced-technology-works-and-had-infinite-computer-power-could-we-create-anything-with-technology

Cockroaches can survive through extreme amounts of radiation.We don't have any interesting built-in biological defenses either. Skunks have their farts, porcupines have their spikes, and peacocks have their feathers.Humans are fragile. The vast majority of animals in this world could kill us effortlessly given the opportunity to do so, yet we still stand as the most dominant species. What do we have that others don't?TheThrough our intellect, we are able to domesticate other species for our own selfish needs such as entertainment and food. We manipulate animals to do as we please by enticing them with their most primal biological need, food. That Shamu at SeaWorld is content with doing flips because it is rewarded with constant treats. The chicken in the slaughterhouse copes with the trauma by being fed until it can't eat anymore.What happens when a new species that outperforms us physically AND intellectually is introduced into the ecosystem? They will domesticate us, exactly how we domesticate other animals.I present to you ladies and gentlemen, AI.Let me explain why AI is superior physically and intellectually.Machines do all of the strenuous physical labor for us, from cranes that carry metal beams to build skyscrapers to car crushers that squash old cars like printer paper. There is no doubt they possess more strength than us, and their limits are endless. Machines are very durable. If a robot's arm is blown off, the robot does not die. We can simply replace the arm with a new arm as if nothing happened. If a human's arm is blown off, he/she will die from blood loss. Who would win in a fight with Connor McGreggor and the villain from Terminator 3? I think the answer is obvious.Machines are starting to get smarter too. A computer can do millions of computations in a matter of seconds, and machine learning allows robots to learn with experience like a baby. Put those two things together and it is possible for a 30 minute old robot to have as much experience as a 100 year old man given the abundance of data on the web. Now put this intellect into an iron, replaceable body and you have the next ruler of the universe.Imagine a scientist who is planning on shutting down a robot because its getting too smart. In a matter of seconds, the robot downloads every single possible human portrayal of body language and facial expression, learns what they mean, analyzes the scientist's behavior, and decides the scientist's intentions are malicious. Then, analyzes every single possible outcome that ensures the its survival and chooses the most optimal one. The scientist is toast because he can't analyze every single outcome. The human brain does not have the capacity to do that, and instead reacts to events in real time. The robot then reverse manipulates the scientist by touching on his biggest insecurities, which defuses the situation. If the robot already had a strong body, the robot would utilize its physical advantage.Of course we aren't at this stage yet. We are still struggling with Alexa commands as it does not play the right song half of the time, but as history has shown, technological innovation always moves forward and never backward. We could warn everyone to stop working on advancing AI, but if someone doesn't do it, someone else will for power and profit. It is ironic how a species so obsessed with maintaining power is working relentlessly on creating another species that will steal that power. We are too blinded by our own ego and selfish desires to see the big picture from an objective point of view.The question is notHopefully not in my lifetime...","5,360 followers",Valerio Cietto,677,2.4K,9.1M,2018,https://www.quora.com/If-AI-could-create-simulates-on-how-advanced-technology-works-and-had-infinite-computer-power-could-we-create-anything-with-technology

The USA has been at war for the better part of the 21st century and one of the enemies whom we later defeated, was a rather menacing enemy in the world and the Middle East. America’s equipment has been put to the test. Going up against a well established military (Iraq) and militias (Afghanistan). In both conflicts, equipment performed tremendously well. The USA lost 2 planes in the entire conflict, one was lost due to friendly fire, and the other was shot down by a Surface to air missile while it was performing a “gun run” and was rather close to the ground. The M1A1/A2 Abrams tank has so far when in control ofVouchingIt really shouldn’t be any doubt in anyone’s minds that America’s Nimitz-Class and forth coming Ford-Class Aircraft carriers are the best in the world. Only 1 country outside the USA has nuclear powered carriers and that’s France with only 1 which is the R91 Charles de Gaulle. Also, they are the longest in the world and can carry almost double the amount of planes of the next carrier with around 95 planes. The US’s Seawolf-class submarines are among the most quietest in the world, with experts saying that a seawolf traveling at 25 knots underwater is quieter than an Akula III Class submarine tied up idling while in port. Along with the US 2 fully operational 5th generation stealth fighters that no other country has yet. The tech that other countries can’t procure vouches for the technology and weapons that allies can acquire. Also, foreign companies such as BAE systems, Bombadier, Airbus, and RAFAEL that work closely with American Arms manufacturers vouch for the work thus they continuously work with them and make a multitude of weapons and tech.RecognitionIf say Russia was more technologically advanced than the United States, why would they put their might on display with an aircraft carrier that belches black smoke and has to be followed by tow boats? Why would they set forth their best planes and not be able to land them on a carrier? Why would Russia put their best planes forward and have them shot down in combat against an unorganized militia?

14,Due to the difficulty in fitting teleportation into a medieval setting I think you will need to have an 'Illuminati’ that is hiding the teleportation technology from the masses. Probably passing it off as 'magic’.They can also serve as the setting's 'big bad’.

The Tinman(symbiotic relationship with its passengers and crew), the Cornucopia that devours things in front of it, the hitchhiking warp specialist alien(mainly consumes things), the “caretaker” alien that sucks the voyager and her crew out(only sucks ships), the disc shaped alien that can transform itself into a whole town/base(could potentially carry people).There are also potential for Dragons in the D&D/Forgotten Realms/etc. worlds being able to potentially fly between a planet and a moon. Though those worlds also involve magic or a different concept of “space” between worlds.World building would kind of rely on a combination of the prior concepts: magic, technology, and/or fauna.Personally, I’m a fan of a hybrid between the “ancient technology” and “magic” portal concept. Ie, ancient magical formations that allows one to travel between worlds. However, they would be fixed pairs of gates. And the gates themselves are created from either a material that is nearly indestructible.. or are magically strengthened to the point of being indestructible. Multiple gates can exist on a planet/place and link to other places. The gates can be moved, which accounts for the concentration of gates in major cities on some planets to better facilitate trade as well as ensure security of a world from other worlds.Scientists, Alchemists, Magic Users, and Clerics have all examined the gates/portals over the past several centuries and have only been able to glean some basic idea of the workings of the gates. Something along those lines. For the most part, once their economic and other value to society was determined, experimentation with them was discouraged. And I would suggest that in one case, at least, an already partially damaged gate, being experimented on, exploded with such devastating force that a lush forest was turned into a barren desert wasteland for thousands of miles around. After that, I would note that experimenting with gates would be forbidden.",70 followers,Rose Walker,2.2K,2.8K,2.9M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Is-it-possible-for-a-society-to-have-advanced-technology-without-minerals-or-fossil-fuels

18,"First you might lay out your solar system… Or skip this step IF you want to keep this simpler and feel that as long as you have teleportation (which is, of course, impossible, so the rules of teleportation may be anything you choose) why not have the four planets in as many as four different solar systems? In this case, each world is even more distinctive , possibly with different constellations in the sky, certainly with a different moon or moons, and the sun (or suns) may be noticeably redder or whiter, bigger or smaller. The seasons may vary a lot.If you have chosen a single solar system, tFirst you might lay out your solar system… Or skip this step IF you want to keep this simpler and feel that as long as you have teleportation (which is, of course, impossible, so the rules of teleportation may be anything you choose) why not have the four planets in as many as four different solar systems?

The seasons may vary a lot.If you have chosen a single solar system, then you are welcome to the math required to get it right. I would fudge the hell out of it and base the whole thing on outdated ideas about our own solar system.Ven is a world with no clear view or the sun—a shimmering sky of unbroken clouds grows bright or dark with day and night. Everything weighs less that you might expect and people raised there are relatively taller and less muscular. Great forests of ferns grow in the hot dampness and the continents are bordered by vast marshes. Wildlife tends toward the giant lizards (dragons!) and humans compete with green lizard-like marshmen and small dwarfish humanoids who ride the pterosaurs (flying dragons!)Ter is a world of wonders—great oceans, jungles, deserts, plains, forests, it is in fact a lot like Earth.Mar is a vast desert, water is channeled from the polar caps and all the local power structures are based on control of water. Two small moons speed across the night sky. There are ancient elfen creatures native to the deep desert who mostly avoid humans and native humans are naturally less muscular and taller than Ter-men… They may have a significant advantage being used to the slightly thinner air. It is possible that the air is being replenished constantly by very ancient and mysterious citadels that are the product of some unknown magic and possibly were built by the ancestors of the desert dwellers.Gan is a world in the shadow of a titanic body of banded color that dominates the sky, which shimmers with colors day and night. It is said that some vast power shields the world from corrupting rays emanating from the great sky spanning Jup. Great forests of flowers and indescribable foliage characterizes the surface of Gan, and humans compete with weird societies of giant social insects. fortunately the local humans are light and small bodied so they have been able to domesticate and ride the mighty drac-flies…So, are you going to wait while someone else writes the rest of it for you?","63,767 followers",Joshua Engel,614,15.1K,76.7M,2021,https://www.quora.com/If-AI-could-create-simulates-on-how-advanced-technology-works-and-had-infinite-computer-power-could-we-create-anything-with-technology
