There are currently three firms in the running, and have offered fairly different platforms — and testing is now in its final phase.AllNext Generation Squad Weapon: Who Is In the Running?The Defense firm General Dynamics’ offering is perhaps the most radical of the three. Their bullpup design sees magazines loaded behind the trigger group, offering a longer barrel length — and therefore higher muzzle velocities and increased maximum effective range — while maintaining a very compact overall length.General Dynamics partnered with True Velocity to develop what they think could be the next revolution in ammunition. ASig Sauer’s entry is perhaps one of theOn the other hand, Textron’s ammunition is the most bizzare-looking — they decided to design their platform around telescopic ammunition, wherein the entire bullet and propellant are encased within the cartridge case, offering a more compact, lighter cartridge. Though on paper there are significant gains to be made with such ammunition, the technology is extremely green and untested.Changing TimesIt’s not just the U.S.The supposed weight savings touted by the Army by using plastic casing rather than brass may not be as great as they seem. Individual soldiers don’t always carry enough ammunition to take full benefit of a reduction in ammunition weight — the greatest benefit would be logistically, to the ships, planes, and trucks that move large quantities of ammunition, not to the individual soldier.Furthermore, using plastic cases could come at an inopportune time. Dr. Allan Orr, a Sydney-based anti-terrorism specialist explained just why the Army’s new ammunition might not be the best idea, explaining that “the Great Pacific garbage patch over the next 50 years will only increase at a time when the world is trying to get on top of it.” This has also led to some speculation that light-weight plastic ammunition could be a hard sell for European","135,529 followers",Hector Quintanilla,4.8K,1.2K,88.6M,UNKNOWN,https://www.quora.com/What-will-be-the-next-generation-technology-weapon

Why else are governments asking for more and more end user information of internet applications?Terrorism has this huge advantage of simply grabbing what it needs to use and not having to give a damn about something that fails - exactly the way James Bond functions.  If James Bond had been Javed Bukhari, and was releasing missiles from his watch at American white Christian enemies, he would have been branded a terrorist not an 'action spy' character or something so fancy and benign sounding!Is there any technology James Bond wouldn't use to kill?",629 followers,Shahamad Khan,4K,150,820.5K,2014,https://www.quora.com/What-will-be-the-next-generation-technology-weapon

With the advent of modern technologies it is possible now to kill the terrorists hidden in bunkers, behind walls, etc. But they know this fact that if they didn't adapt to this change and make use of similar high tech weaponry and technology, it may lead to the extinction of their species. Even small pests adapt over time, and we are talking of humans with developed yet vicious brains.Coming to the point of various technologies they will use, we should first understand the warfare techniques used by them. Terrorists are the sort of people who do not involve in direct attack because they just do not have the enough numbers to match the armies of other nations. Therefore they prefer guerrilla warfare. They attack civilians unawares, plant bombs at crowded locations, hold people hostage to meet their demands, attack the armies from secret locations. As of now small guns, AK47, grenades, IED's etc. have served their purpose to destroy human life effectively. But as the technology is evolving on a daily basis, terrorists too will evolve.""With the pro of any good technology there is an associated con ""I believe that some of the most revolutionary technologies like robotics would be used by terrorists for destruction. A swarm of aerial robots can target a complete city effectively and terrorists need not even come out of their secret place. There are so many DiY available for making such type of robots that any random person can build these. Only thing that terrorists need to do is load them with grenades and bombs etc.  Imagine a rain of  bombs in your city. Plus these small aerial robots can go inside a secure locations of authorities taking them out first to create a complete chaos. It is frightening thought but, nevertheless possible. If amazon, netflix can deliver a package at our doorstep, a terrorist organization can surely deliver a bomb using the same technology.There are many other technologies which can be used a cruel-some way. But I choose to refrain from thinking about that. If a person in his right mind can think about so much cruel stuff about a technology, what about a terrorist then ??",297 followers,Sanyoo Cilamu,839,378,572.1K,2014,https://www.quora.com/Considering-the-innovative-technology-usage-in-terrorism-what-are-the-next-probable-technology-adoptions-for-terrorism

Digital age will make way for digital terrorism. The trends already point towards increasing cyber hostility and capabilities directed towards compromising digital security.Terrorism in the future looks like an organised activity of sophisticated and large networks. Most probably these groups will be covertly funded by hostile nations.Today many of the radical groups have embraced internet. Web has facilitated communications, knowledge exchange and even recruiting. The traditional terrorists outfits will adopt easily available consumer facing products. These will include 3D printers and robotics (as Sumit Jadhav pointed out).Will these groups develop in-house cutting edge technical expertise? That seems a far fetched and highly improbable scenario. I believe that terrorism will become more remote and virtual in this century. We will see more and more acts of hacking than bombings.At the end, it will always be about exploiting the human condition. The human will remain the weakest link the technology ecosystem.
