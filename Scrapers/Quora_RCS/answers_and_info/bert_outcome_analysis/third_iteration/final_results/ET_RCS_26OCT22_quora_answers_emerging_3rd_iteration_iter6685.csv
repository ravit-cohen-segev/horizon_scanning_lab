10,"Humans have become so advanced in utilizing technology because their technology has become so advanced. That seems like a circular answer, but let me explain.Early HomininsThe first human ancestor appeared roughly 2 - 3 Million years ago. Homo Sapiens appeared roughly 300,000 - 500,000 years ago and our technology remained “stone age” for almost all of that time. Our brain structure, by then was considered as developed as it is now, yet our technology remained very primitive for many thousands of years, at least until the advent of agriculture.AgriculturePrior to agriculture, humans spent muchHumans have become so advanced in utilizing technology because their technology has become so advanced.

Homo Sapiens appeared roughly 300,000 - 500,000 years ago and our technology remained “stone age” for almost all of that time. Our brain structure, by then was considered as developed as it is now, yet our technology remained very primitive for many thousands of years, at least until the advent of agriculture.AgriculturePrior to agriculture, humans spent much of their time hunting and gathering and moving from place to place in response to hunting migratory animals. The experience of humans in different locations was different, but this was the general idea. although there was free time, there wasn’t enough to devote to the advancement of culture and ideas. We were too busy hunting and gathering and eating food that wouldn’t last too long from season to season.After the advent of agriculture and animal husbandry, humans were actually able to create a large surplus of food, store it, and stay in one place.This is when permanent civilizations such as in Mesopotamia were able to develop. Now people had more free time (at least some of them). Keeping track of crops, water supply, grain, food, etc was tough business and required written language as well as a class of people who administered all of this.Our ability to communicate helps to accelerate our technology by being able to pass knowledge from one person or one group of people to another. Unlike other animals, humans can teach their young how to build things. When we teach something to a new generation, that new generation has time to improve on what they learn so we get incremental developments in our culture and technology over successive generations.Written language changed that paradigm. Now, knowledge and culture could be recorded and shared across geographies and time. Our intelligence is enhanced by communication and especially written communication where culture and technology are shared more efficiently, to a larger number of participants, and leaves time for people to improve on old ideas or ideas from other geographic areas.This ability to share information using written language was enhanced with the development of Papyrus, then paper, then the printing press, television, and now the Internet.Early humans (hominins) were on earth 2 million years ago. Humans as they are today for 300,000 years, and yet our technology didn’t change much for nearly all that time. It has only been in the last 10,000 years or so that our technology has seen a massive increase in amount and complexity and the rate of advancement is now exponential. You see, with culture and technology, it’s almost impossible to invent an airplane in the stone age. Even someone born today if taken back to the stone age couldn’t build a viable airplane and even if transported to the 1800’s couldn’t build a useful cell phone. Culture expands on culture.Humans evolved to become so technologically advance because of our ability to communicate across time and geography more than just pure intelligence. What our ancestors discovered in the past has shaped our future. Our children will not have to reinvent things because they’ll already know how and will invent new and better things than we ever did.","220,630 followers",Franklin Veaux,1.8K,47.3K,783M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Where-is-the-legal-profession-going-in-terms-of-evolving-in-a-technological-society

12,"I wouldn’t say utilization of technology is so much about evolution rather a result of accumulated knowledge, books, universities and institutions. Wright brothers invented airplanes around early 1900 and within a few years, in the world wars, fighter air crafts were dog fighting. There was no evolutionary change in a couple of decades.

13,"Any tool use is technology.Dairying, the routine keeping of mammals for milk production, is a historically important technology. And in cultures where dairying was developed, we generally see the evolution of lactase persistance — the generation of the enzyme to digest milk sugar long after typical weaning.The opposite, wild-type condition is lactose intolerance. It can be quite unpleasant, because if you don’t digest milk sugar there are bacteria in your gut which will be quite happy to do so — with the concomitant production of copious quantities of gas.
