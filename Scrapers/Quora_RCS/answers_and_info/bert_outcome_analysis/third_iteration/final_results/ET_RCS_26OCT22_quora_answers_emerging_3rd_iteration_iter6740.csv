1,"Honestly, one of the last mainstream advances was in the 1930s, where the double-stack/single feed magazine for pistols was perfected for what would become the Browning Hi-Power.Mag technology hasn’t really seen innovative changes since then, it’s been fit & finish, materials, and capacity improvements. We’re using the Version 1.0, 1.1, 1.2 style of changes. There hasn’t been a Version 2.0 in over 80 years for magazines.",126 followers,Peter Armstrong,715,1.5K,1.4M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Could-marine-life-ever-evolve-to-use-build-technology-or-as-crazy-as-it-sounds-go-to-space

It must be noted, though, that this isBelow the gun with both drum (on a decommissioned gun) and stick magazines.One more picture, since they usually tell a lot more than words only:Here's a Kalašhnikov with a drum mag. It's besides the G36 the only assault rifle I've actually seen and heard people use drum magazines with. I bet there are more but the situations where you actually could largely benefit from extra bullets are usually just not there.Hope this helps.Images via Google.Edit 15.12:Edit 19.12:Edit 7.6.17 (6.7 for USA):Thank you for all the comments and upvotes!",UNKNOWN,Andrew T.
