More crudely, around air logistics bases where there is not total control of the ground, bigger, slower cargo carriers take off/land then a drone swarm could be crashed in to them, threatening engines certainly - like deliberate bird strike which regularly causes problems (Miracle on the Hudson). Camp Bastion, a base in otherwise loosely controlled territory and so subject to regular attack, may already now not be feasible due to this form of attack.Helicopters operating low to the ground would be even more vulnerable from say two roped, simple drones, like larger civil ones freely available, flown into the rotor arc.

Combing with unmanned platforms with machine learning algorithm would make weapons more lethal towards targets. However, this is likely to face some obstacles or limitations from international laws due to its huge potentials and relevant risks. South Korean once developed an autonomous patrol vehicle on the 38 parallel to prevent North Korean infiltration.Materials are obviously crucial for military as it allows building well performed war machines. Advanced ceramics, new explosives, radar stealth materials are examples of the past developments. The future is metamaterials, constructed by engineering form molecule/crystal lattice level that it could have a lot more sophisticated traits, such as true optical stealth, or smart materials that would adjust radar frequency absorption. These magic-like traits could be achieved by metamaterials and thus countries are putting resources on that subject.The biotechnology here refers to a broader terms, including normal pure biology type as well as biology meeting electronics. Regenerative tissues and stem cell technology could be used for healing wounded personnel with ease and reduce attrition. This also reduce load on medical system on both the military and civilian sides, increasing the chance of winning by the faction that implemented that. This also means less disabled personnel and thus many veterans could return to the battle (if they are willing to, they probably would). Also, the risk of weaponized bio-agents such as super viruses could be countered by biotechnology, through engineered cells to assist human body to resist and eradicate the viral strain infecting the person. Taking it to the extreme and we can have supersoldiers or implants allow “telepathy” or mind/brain wave controlling machines, such as one-man battleships. Biotechnology is useful when it comes to protecting lives and improve conditions and capabilities of military personnel.Yes, that fusion that is always 20 years away (now 15?). With the increased need for energy for insane (for us) computation as well as energy used for powering destructive weapons such as lasers, powered exoskeletons, fusion would come in handy to prevent shortage of energy especially when energy crisis happens. Also, in near endgame scenarios, pure fusion weapons may be deployed and it would produce minimal or even no fallout (which makes conventional nuclear weapon very scary), and allow occupation soon after target is destroyed (though the energy released is still quite significant and may result global warming, literally and significantly).

It was designed according tto the Pennsylvanian traffic code. Matson Navigation followed suit with their container based on California traffic codes two years later.In 1968, ISO (International Organization for Standardization) established the first standards for containers.The US Army started using containers to support the effort in Vietnam in 1968.If this method of moving supplies for the Allies had been used in World War II, port capacities would have grown exponentially from what they did accomplish in the war. It would have allowed for the rapid loading and unloading of shipping.In 1965, dock labour could move 1.7 tons a hour. In 1970, using containers, the same amount of labour could move 30 tons a hour. The amount today is even higher.Using standard fittings, the containers could be stacked on one another, loading directly onto tractor-trailer units or railcars.An effect of this technology can be seen in the Longshoremen’s union attempts to get the use of containers limited. They wanted all loading of containers themselves within 50 miles of a port to be done only by union members and a fee attached to each container shipped. The US Supreme Court ruled against the Longshoremen in 1980.Now, the Western Allies in 1945 were in a logistical realm that was sheer fantasy to some of the other powers of the day. However, the use of containers could have eliminated the need for the Red Ball Express or other logistical shortfalls that they had in 1943/44 time frame.The biggest effect would have been the use of containers by the Germans in the one theatre that has been described as a tactician’s dream and a logistics officer's nightmare: North Africa. The German advance team determined that most the infrastructure in North Africa could support was about two and half divisions. The nature of the theatre required that these divisions be motorized or mechanized. Hence the size of the original Afrika Korps (DAK), two panzer divisions (15th and 21st) and some other elements that eventually became the 90th Light Division.Now, if the Germans and Italians had access to containers, the size of the DAK could have been increased to the original proposed size of 4 panzer divisions.

This is unlike Ethereum which only works with their own Solidity language. This makes it much easier for developers around the world to start coding on Neo.Recently Neo found another use for itself, to digitalize real world assets.
