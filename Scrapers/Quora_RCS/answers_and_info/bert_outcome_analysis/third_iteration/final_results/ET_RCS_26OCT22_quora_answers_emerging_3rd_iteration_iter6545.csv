0,"At its simplest, blockchain is a digital ledger of transactions shared across a global network of powerful computers. It uses cryptography to allow each participant on the network to add to the ledger in a secure way without the need for a central authority.Each time a digital payment or transfer is made to the ledger, every computer on the network sees the transaction and verifies it instantly using open-source software. All of the information tied to the transaction is then stored in a unit called a ""block."" Each block is digitally stacked, one next to the other, in a chronological chain.

Hence the term blockchain.This is completely different from how financial institutions operate today.If a bank in New York wants to send $100 to a bank in Taiwan, each side maintains its own record of the transaction. Teams of accountants and bookkeepers and auditors oversee every transfer and payment to ensure that $100 is really subtracted from the account in New York and credited to the account in Taiwan.","31,157 followers",Phillip Remaker,1.7K,11K,78.8M,2019,https://www.quora.com/How-has-Blockchain-Technology-helped-money-evolve
1,"Maybe rather than “sentient” you mean “technological”? Folks who are into speculating about “Xenobiology” (which is an entirely speculative field….) have wondered if a technological species would have to be more-or less humanoid….With upright posture, free limbs with manipulative digits, binocular vision, etc, etc.Certainly that all would make the development of technology easier. But, what about tentacles? Right here on Earth we note that the octopi are quite bright and quite capable of simple manipulation. With some more sophisticated branching at tentacle-end….They could be quite clever. OrMaybe rather than “sentient” you mean “technological”?

2,"In order to be BAD ASS MOTHERF*CKERS.Did you know that a human can chase down an antelope, easily, just by jogging after them?In order to be BAD ASS MOTHERF*CKERS.Did you know that a human can chase down an antelope, easily, just by jogging after them?One of the most BAD ASS MOTHERF*CKER things about our species is our ability to perform sustained aerobic exercise, for hours on end. It makes us into the Terminator, a relentless killing machine who will stride (or run) implacably towards its target, not stopping until that target is dead. If the animals could talk they would say “Oh god, it just never stops!”. This is calledThe key to this ability is something which is often unwanted, and not really appreciated for the amazing evolutionary advantage that is is:Look at this guy’s skin - it’s soaking wet.That water will turn from liquid into gas, and as it does so it will suck aIf you have fur, sweating just doesn’t really work - nowhere near as well, anyway. The evaporating water might cool your fur down, but it won’t cool your skin down, and thus won’t cool down the muscles underneath that skin, which are the things that really need to lose the heat.So, we lost our body hair in order to become more effective hunters: to become the animal-world equivalent of this guy.",366 followers,Brett Alder,1.1K,0,0,2020,https://www.quora.com/Could-a-sentient-race-evolve-without-opposable-thumbs-And-even-if-it-could-how-would-technology-evolve-without-them

4,"Q: How does evolution know what an animal needs to evolve into?It doesn’t.Q: Opposable thumbs seem obvious in hindsight but what prompted them?Nothing. That’s not how evolution works.Let me give you an illustrative example of how it does work.There is this common bacteria that likes to live in ditches and ponds.It happens that one of these bacteria made a mistake while reproducing. It duplicated a gene responsible for making a particular enzyme important to metabolizing nutrients for the water. That’s okay. Sexual reproduction means is had a spare copy of that enzyme, so it kept on reproducingQ: How does evolution know what an animal needs to evolve into?It doesn’t.Q: Opposable thumbs seem obvious in hindsight but what prompted them?Nothing.

It duplicated a gene responsible for making a particular enzyme important to metabolizing nutrients for the water. That’s okay. Sexual reproduction means is had a spare copy of that enzyme, so it kept on reproducing. Then, one of its descentants underwent another mutation, a frame shift that caused one of these duplicated genes to code for a novel enzyme that doesn’t fit any molecule in nature. It’s a common type of mutation, and had probably happened many times over the eons only to eventually be lost again. But this time, the bacteria happened to be growing in a waste pond at a chemical plant, where it has access to man made polymers.The novel enzyme didn’t fit these polymers exactly, but it was close enough to let the bacteria do something no other living thing has every done in the history of Earth—each a byproduct of the manufacture of nylon. This let the bacteria prosper in the waste pond, and given time, new mutations will come along. Some will be useless or fatal. But given enough time, one will help is digest the chemicals in that pond better then its neighbors, and then it will have the advantage.And that’s how evolution works.","105,674 followers",Dave Consiglio,544,6.8K,91.6M,2017,https://www.quora.com/Could-a-sentient-race-evolve-without-opposable-thumbs-And-even-if-it-could-how-would-technology-evolve-without-them
