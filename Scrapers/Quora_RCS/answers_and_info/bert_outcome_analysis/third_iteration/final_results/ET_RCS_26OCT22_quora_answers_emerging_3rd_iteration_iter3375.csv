It is conservatively estimated that if the supply of Huawei is cut off, American companies will lose hundreds of billions of dollars. So at that time, American companies protested.Qualcomm once said that the cutoff would not prevent Huawei from obtaining the necessary components. On the contrary, it would make Qualcomm lose 8 billion U.S. dollars in the market, but in the end there was no alternative.Why can a company make a powerful country so gloomy? Not only banned sales and cut supply, but also dismantled the original Huawei equipment in operation already. For this, the United States has to pay huge expenses. Not only that, because of the technological superiority of Huawei equipment, dismantling Huawei equipment will result in many areas without effective alternative products and unable to network communications.The United Kingdom has also stated that more than 18,000 base stations in the United Kingdom use Huawei's equipment, and what is more serious is that banning Huawei will delay the UK's 5G listing for three years.Is the US behind China in 5G?YesAfter seeing the rapid growth of China's 5G, the United States finally made crazy moves to increase its suppression of Huawei to an unprecedented level!Never in history, a self-proclaimed the World’s sole superpower enters a state of emergency because of a Chinese private enterprise Huawei.Regarding Huawei's experience in the United States, both China and the United States should make someJust a new footnote: the 3G wireless network in the USA will soon be shut down to make room for the 5G network in the frequency range.

4,"This afternoon, BBC’s Click gave a brief overview of the enormous strides that the Chinese company Huawei has made in its development of 5G infrastructure, but this has created concern amongst western security agencies that if the UK was to take on board Huawei rather than what the US has to offer, the fear is that the Chinese government could use its leverage to infiltrate itself into everything that 5G touches and bring the UK to a diabolical halt, and the TV program gave very disturbing footage of how this could happen in the next 5 to 10 years.Scary stuff, but rather than concern ourselvesThis afternoon, BBC’s Click gave a brief overview of the enormous strides that the Chinese company Huawei has made in its development of 5G infrastructure, but this has created concern amongst western security agencies that if the UK was to take on board Huawei rather than what the US has to offer, the fear is that the Chinese government could use its leverage to infiltrate itself into everything that 5G touches and bring the UK to a diabolical halt, and the TV program gave very disturbing footage of how this could happen in the next 5 to 10 years.Scary stuff, but rather than concern ourselves with what could happen, let’s review what actually has happened over the past few decades.5G will change the way we live. Everything will be connected and we will have smart homes, smart cities, driverless cars, robots, the whole shebang.Where 4G delivers 150 megabits per second, 5G will deliver 14.58 gigabits per second.Huawei campus.A very interesting article published on 25th June 2016 tells us that the so called ‘special relationship’ between the US and the UK is, and always was, a myth, see:Philip Pullman - ArticlesThe UK may have thought we had something in common with the US, but that was as far as the special relationship went, so when Theresa May went rushing to Donald Trump just after he was elected president, all she did was demonstrate just how gullible she is.The US is beside itself with rage that the UK is going to hook up with Huawei and is basically why Gavin Williamson was sacked for leaking this to a newspaper, something the UK government really didn’t want to be made public.We know for a fact that the US government through its National Security Agency has been routinely spying on everyone for God knows how long. We know for a fact the CIA has its grubby little paws into virtually every corner of the globe, and we know just how instrumental it is in creating havoc wherever it touches.Also, it’s the CIA website that provides information on every single country and nation state on the planet, seeCentral Intelligence AgencyBut that’s not the half of it. During the 90s I guess, hidden forces deemed that Microsoft Windows would take precedence over Unix in who the preferred operating system would be worldwide, and everyone who ever used Windows 98 will remember just how prone it was to viruses, worms, Trojan horses and the like. This wasn’t just an accident, but deliberate policy designed to ensure that households worldwide owned computers that were especially vulnerable to malicious software, all of which could easily been avoided had Unix been the preferred operating system for ordinary people.So, if anybody intends to wreck the UK, it wont be China, but let us be in no doubt who the main protagonists are in the battle for 5G supremacy.According to5G Market Research: What are the top players upto? - GreyBthe main players are:1.	Samsung Electronics (South Korea)2. Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd. (China)3.	Nokia Networks (Finland)4. NEC Corporation (Japan)5.	Ericsson (Sweden)6. Qualcomm (US)7.	Verizon (US)8. Orange (France)9. Mobile TeleSystems (Russia)10. AT&T (US)11. Cisco Systems (US)But what are the differences between 4G, with which we are all familiar, and 5G? According toWhat is the difference between 4G and 5G?Simply said, 5G is widely believed to be smarter, faster and more efficient than 4G. It promises mobile data speeds that far outstrip the fastest home broadband network currently available to consumers. With speeds of up to 100 gigabits per second, 5G is set to be as much as 100 times faster than 4G.The transition from 4G to 5G will be not unlike that from 32 to 64 bit computers. Back in the old days of 32 bit Windows 98 and Vista, we had rudimentary video, music and voice to data, but it was limited, and data communication speeds were slow.Nowadays of course, 64 bit microprocessors and wireless connectivity have created a revolution in what we can see and hear. Plus, Microsoft really cleaned up their act with Windows 10, and nowadays, viruses are basically a thing of the past.4G and 5G are little more than highways for data communications, but what sets 5G apart is the number of things that will be connected to each other, but as always, it’s the software running inside the processors that will control everything. The fact that data will get to its destination a hundred times faster is neither here nor there, it’s basically no different than the old dial up modems and wireless routers.So, basically, the US wishes to scare people into thinking that doing business with China will leave us wide open to potential sabotage, but if the past is anything to go by and we have to choose between presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping, I know which side I want my bread buttered.","68,772 followers",Kanthaswamy Balasubramaniam,898,17.3K,413.3M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Would-the-U-S-ever-combine-their-5G-efforts-with-China-to-go-forward-to-advance-technology-on-a-world-wide-level

Companies like Harris Telecommunication, Motorola, AT&T… Lucent Technologies, Bell Labs and a lot more have either gone bankrupt or bought over, today there are no American telecommunication company left. So in order for US to catch up she need to use the “Manhattan project” style to catch up (no success either because telecommunications industry is moving too fast). The other way is to buy either Nokia or Ericsson and go from there (still need to pump a lot of resources to catch up with Huawei).HuaWei is the only True 5G manufacturer, the rest (Ericsson, ZTE, Nokia) need other companies to partner in order to provide 5G solutions. HuaWei is also more than 2 years ahead of her nearest competitor in term of technologies.The other reason why HUAWEI is faster and better than western technology companies is because of horizontal expansion (taking out expensive American partners and replacing with home grown technologies like cloud servers and blade servers, power, routers, batteries, transmission, billing, etc) and in the process improved their performances like power … customized to greatly decrease power consumption needs (over 30%) while also perfectly fully utilized telecommunications needs instead of buying from third parties which are made for multiple purposes and industrial needs (this is just one example why Nokia and Ericsson cannot catch up … they could not force suppliers to customize to their needs because of small volumes).In the technology ecosystem, there are various global companies providing certain bits and pieces to certain solutions. These companies derive from USA, Japan, Korea, China, Taiwan (China), Europe, South East Asia.That is the reason why anyone offering certain solutions need American technologies….. likewise if Americans are offering a certain solutions then they need other countries to collaborate.In the 5G space there are components made by American companies that HuaWei and ZTE are using. But with the recent turn of events (trump), the Chinese are looking at reinventing the wheel or specifically saying taking out the Americans portion only. (HuaWei has started building their own chipsets instead of buying them from Intel, Qualcomm or Broadcom and HW is also building the next generation 5G/6G IOT operating system that will not only replace goggle OS but simply leapfrogging goggle to integrate and create an entirely technologically new ecosystem that comprises of everyday consumer goods like air conditioning, TV, Stereo, fridge, washing machine etc. to smart vehicles to financial to banking to work environment. It would also integrate corporate business to business to everyday consumers to governmental agencies.)Must see … learn the dirty long arms of American that virtually destroyed Japanese semiconductor Industry, smash Germany’s and France Power Industry and also lied and jailed innocent French executive. Now US is back again to destroy the world leading Telecommunications companies ….Thus with constant changes to US laws (FCPA)to control the whole world every time we use a US product or services we are under US super long arm of jurisdiction and could be kidnapped at any time like HW CFO, Ms. Meng.Also with the American law (FCPA), they can go around the world to steal and spy on everyone and anyone they like. Also all American companies like Apple, Microsoft, Google, Facebook, UPS, Federal Express, Amazon, Cisco, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America and a lot have to assist the American Government (FBI, CIA, NED, US military, US Justice) to spy on foreign governments , militaries, institutions, universities, companies and not to forget including you and meLike in my office … when I use Microsoft office, Facebook, Google mail, Cisco routers, HP servers, Dell notebook, Avaya office IP phones, Apple phones etc…. I am not only being spied but can be prosecuted by Americans under their law even if I am not a US citizen or not on US soil or dealing with US companies (by just using American products I can be charged under US law - FCPA).That is one reason why the Chinese are rapidly replacing all American products and decouple from American totally.","9,864 followers",Kenzi Mudge,1.8K,1.3K,8.3M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Would-the-U-S-ever-combine-their-5G-efforts-with-China-to-go-forward-to-advance-technology-on-a-world-wide-level

You didn't need a college degree but you did need a good work ethic.Just a few examples from my hometown of 30,000. There used to be three bakeries in that town now there is one. We used to have a radiator manufacturing plant that is now out of business. We started out with a small meat packing plant which grew to a bigger plant which is now sitting mostly idle. Those jobs paid very well. I can think of at least a dozen other manufacturing businesses that didn't have as many employees but those who did work there were paid well.My wife worked at a manufacturing plant and when it came time for labor negotiations with the union the union held out for higher wages despite the fact that the company had already said that it was no longer able to pay higher wages. They would be better off moving the plant to Mexico. As a result the plant was moved to Mexico.Another local issue was a paper mill that was closed down years ago. The federal government required them to do some upgrades and the upgrades we're so expensive that they closed the plant.I could go on and on with examples similar to these. I live in timber country and we have seen saw mill after saw mill closed down. We have seen logging families that have been doing logging for several generations lose their business and livelihoods. When the mills close down foreign investors come and buy the equipment at auction. Then what little logging is left is shipped overseas to be milled into lumber then sold here in the United States by other countries.It is ironic that the left cannot see what they have done to this country.Our trade treaties between foreign nations have mostly accomplished putting Americans out of work. It is now much more profitable for a company to move their operations out of the United States. There are no negative repercussions for the people owning these companies but there are a lot of benefits, mostly financial, to moving these operations out.In the meantime the left screams about global warming and CO2 emissions. Consequently, they have enacted environmental rules that have forced American manufacturing companies out of business. And in doing so they have forced a lot of Americans out of high paying jobs with a future.They have also pushed a lot of those jobs into China and Asian countries and Mexico. These are places that are not nearly as environmentally conscious. So basically they have run the businesses out of the United States under the guise of climate change while adding even more pollution buy putting those businesses in places like China.And that doesn't even consider all of the added rules that American businesses are forced to comply with regarding labor laws and taxes.What really amazes me most though is how the labor unions support the Democratic Party which is a leader in sending our jobs overseas and at the forefront pushing for cheap labor in the form of illegal immigrants to come in and take those low-skill jobs away from Americans.",65 followers,Xinyu Ma,20.3K,0,0,2019,https://www.quora.com/Would-the-U-S-ever-combine-their-5G-efforts-with-China-to-go-forward-to-advance-technology-on-a-world-wide-level
7,"That plays a role, but the much bigger role is played by the corporatist government.Initially, big businesses grew big by being the best, the cheapest, or but once they became big, they started buying off politicians and lobbying for legislation specifically to protect their business.

Meanwhile, Coke is a massive organization where many employees are interchangeable and that means they can keep wages relatively low or go for automation to replace them, whereas many mom-and-pop businesses operate with only a few employees who split the proceeds or do other forms of dividend-reinvestment profit-sharing.Those former employees can now look forward to unemployment instead.",1 follower,Forrest Harris,17.5K,359,41.4M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Would-the-U-S-ever-combine-their-5G-efforts-with-China-to-go-forward-to-advance-technology-on-a-world-wide-level

It is also one of the most bio diverse places on Earth and is currently the 6th most visited country.But sometimes it is important to focus on the economy.As a country, Mexico is one of the world’s 15 largest economies (measured by GDP). Since it also has a large population (about 128 million), GDP per capita is not so great (it occupies the 59th, 63rd or 65th place, depending on who does the counting). Add to that the issue of inequality: Mexico ranks among the most unequal places on Earth, along with some other Latin American and African countries, plus China. The result? Some urban pockets of great wealth surrounded by very poor neighborhoods and, for the most part, a very poor rural population.By my own reckoning, that makes us poor rather than rich, but it also creates some interesting opportunities if we’re up to the task of confronting the following issues: education, income distribution, crime prevention, political involvement, international trade.We badly need to overcome a culture that emphasizes handing (inadequate) assistance out to the poor and concentrate on helping young people to become more innovative, socially involved and entrepreneurial in outlook.","135,501 followers",Hector Quintanilla,3.1K,1.2K,88.5M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Will-automation-create-a-bigger-gap-between-the-rich-and-poor
16,"I find it astonishing-and quite depressing-that none of the respondents to this question so far (August 5, 2015) has bothered to challenge the premise of the question-- that the poor are getting poorer in India. That is completely wrong. In fact, the poor in India are escaping from extreme poverty in historically unprecedented numbers. For example, between 1987/88 and 2011/12, the share of people living below the international extreme poverty line--$1.90/day adjusted for purchasing power — dropped by more than half, from 44.8% to 21.2%. Moreover, the pace of improvement has been accelerating:I find it astonishing-and quite depressing-that none of the respondents to this question so far (August 5, 2015) has bothered to challenge the premise of the question-- that the poor are getting poorer in India.

Moreover, the pace of improvement has been accelerating: the poverty rate dropped by nearly a one-third in the final two years of that period.Because of India’s large population, that’s a huge reduction in human misery. Most of that progress has been spurred by the economic policy reforms that India has undertaken since the mid-1980s, and especially since 1991, which in turn have boosted its rate of economic growth.The same rapid progress is seen when poverty is measured against India’s national poverty lines – Rs 22 per day in rural areas and Rs 27 per day in cities, both stated in 2011-12 prices. Rural poverty has fallen from 50% in 1993 to 25.7% in 2011; even faster reductions in urban poverty rates, together with gradual urbanization, have brought the all-India poverty rate down from 45.3% in 1993 to 21.9% in 2011.Progress would have been faster if India’s economy were not as tightly regulated as it is, especially the labor laws that make it virtually impossible for a large firm to fire a worker who doesn’t perform, which in turn makes them very reluctant to hire workers.Just as important, a large share of Indian young people leave school without having to learn to read a single sentence, and without any other skills that would help them find a job in the growing economy. That, in turn, reflects the egregious performance of India’s government schools-- with the exception of a few serving the elites. Teachers in government schools are paid 5-7 times as much as teachers in private schools, but many - especially those working in schools serving poor children — routinely fail to come to school. They do so secure in the knowledge that no teachers are ever dismissed for failure to do their jobs. As a result, millions of poor Indian families have turned in desperation to low-cost private schools, where the teachers often lack impressive educational credentials, but at least they show up. As a result, these low-cost private schools achieve far better results for their students than do the government schools. This scandalous situation is well covered in this week’sThe lack of accountability is truly astonishing. The Harvard economist Lant Pritchett personally witnessed the headmaster of a village school explain to parents why none of their children had learned to read after spending multiple years in school: “You’re donkeys,” he told the assembled parents, “and because you’re donkeys, your children are donkeys too. We can’t be expected to teach donkeys to read.” If government school teachers faced even a modest degree of accountability for their performance, such as a requirement that all children learn to read with fluency after no more than two years of school, the prospects for India's poor would improve dramatically.The $1-a-week schoolAugust 2019 update:June 2020 update.The basic problem seems to be that India has adopted a variety of means-tested social safety net programs, which provide significant assistance to many lower-income households. It appears that many of these households suspected that the information they gave on the NSS survey might be used to exclude them from eligibility for these programs, and therefore systematically under-reported their household expenditure. This puts India in the unfortunate position of having to choose whether to help the poor or accurately measure the extent of their poverty.In the meantime, the impact on global poverty measurement have been devastating. In particular, the World Bank has been forced to suppress its regional poverty estimate for South Asia in 2018, because the most recent reliable data for India (those for 2011-12) are too old to be usable. Very, very unfortunate.What is Consumer Expenditure Survey, and why was its 2017-2018 data withheld?",301 followers,Stephane Dauzat,1K,843,1.7M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Will-automation-create-a-bigger-gap-between-the-rich-and-poor

In other ways, those who ‘show off’ mostly have a following amongst poorer people.For example, young and impressionable people, who haven’t seen enough of life. The higher up you go up the income scale (and especially wealth scale) the fewer people are impressed by this sort of stuff AND the more they admire modesty and frugality.I will give you an example. Last year I went back to Shanghai. I reconnected with a few of my old clients — expats in Shanghai.I told them I had my own business. They asked a few questions. I told them I had an online business, as it is cheaper, more efficient and so on.A number of country managers and expat-CEO types made comments like ‘That is right up my street, Adam!’.They admired the business model. It made sense to them. They think ‘well less costs = more money in my pocket’.They know an online business is less likely to go bust compared to a firm with big flashy offices, as cash flow is king.In comparison, I spoke to one or two people who were much lower income (like teachers and others) who thought things like:‘He can’t even afford an office’.‘He only has 10 or 12 people in his company. Why use him when I could use a bank?’The assumption that poorer people sometimes have, is ‘If you don’t have something you can’t afford it’.You aren’t deciding not to afford it. Don’t have a flash website? You can’t afford it! Don’t have an office? Can’t afford it.Don’t have a flash suit? Can’t afford it. Don’t own property and rents? Can’t afford to buy. Their thinking is, why would anybody who has the means, not want these things after all?Well it may seem that way to somebody who has never had anything……..To get in touch today -Some Reading","135,501 followers",Hector Quintanilla,4.9K,1.2K,88.5M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Will-automation-create-a-bigger-gap-between-the-rich-and-poor
