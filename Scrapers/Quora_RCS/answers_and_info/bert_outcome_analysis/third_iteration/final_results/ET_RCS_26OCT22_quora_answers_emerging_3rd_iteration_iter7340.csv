Locals had a faith that visiting him would be the cure for most ailments. They trusted him. He was god-like.He was also famous in my family circles for his strong atheistic views. Reasoning, logic, and objective approaches formed the very core of his life.My family is deep-rooted in Christianity and thus his stance looked oddly outlandish.He was very rich, at least compared to most people in my family. My mom and dad do not have a car even now. But this man had three cars ten years ago. He was a dog lover. He had five dogs.Frequent international tours. Finest food. Stunning cars. Grand lifestyle. Put all these with this: kind, altruistic, balanced, and charismatic personality.That was him. The perfect package.Naturally, as a young man, I considered him my role model. I could not sense a false note anywhere.The final year of my engineering.He was diagnosed with Pancreatic cancer. The news struck us like lightning. The whole family scrabbled its way to his home.His life came crashing like a meteor. The whole town was in disbelief and shock.Many stupid but concerned questions were raised: “How could this happen to HIM?” “Why HIM, of all people?” “How could this happen to a Doctor?”Regardless of the commotion, his time kept ticking. I remember visiting him during his last two months.I literally stopped breathing for a moment when I entered his home.The curtains had been enveloped with dust. The floor had not been mopped. The beautiful plants outside had started dying. The cars stood there begging for attention.Three of the five dogs had been given away. “He wanted to keep Fido and Henry until…” the maid said with a trembling voice, holding on to my mom.Every face in the home was grief-stricken. Death prevailed in the room. There was an absolute silence in the home. Deafening silence.When I walked to his bed-side, every tinge of charm, glamour, and life his face once had had deserted him. He was pale and lifeless.There were pastors in his home. He had apparently requested for people from all faiths to pray for him. There were bibles all over. Verses from the Quran and bible had been pasted all over the wall.His wife told me about the changes he had been showing ever since the diagnosis. That night, I witnessed the horrors of his pain.I was in the hall and I could hear him wailing in his room. “Someone save me. Take this pain away from me. Jesus, please hear me. I beg you. IS THERE A GOD WHO HEARS ME?”I could clearly hear him sobbing like a 10-year old. I could hear thumps. Slaps. Something clawing the ground. Something being dragged on the floor. Something wriggling.A few minutes later.“Darling, forgive me. PLEASE FORGIVE ME. PLEASE TELL ME I WILL LIVE.. JUST TELL ME…JUST….ahhhhhhh”And then some unintelligible mumbling. Muffled screams. Muted and menacing.This continued for almost an hour. And then, silence, marred intermittently by a woman sobbing. His wife.The next morning, the wife said that such nights had become a norm. She said how badly she wished he died instead of enduring the pain.I heard her crying into my mom’s chests: “Akka, I want him to die, but he keeps saying some miracle will happen and he will survive.”I left his home, but my mom told me of how his final hours were.“He kept begging to ALL the gods before stumbling into unconsciousness.” “He sobbed, pleadingly.”He kept believing in a miracle. He waited.We hold on to so many ideologies. Beliefs. Plans. Rules. Policies. Everything is just a facade.When your oxygen runs out. When the last drop of your blood trickles down. When the last month of your life nears. When the last moment arrives.When your life is on the cliffhanger, the human inside you kicks his way out. Trembling. Begging. Pleading. Disproving all the massive facades you had built all your life.Every brick of the wall you have built will be blown to smithereens. Your knowledge will vanish. Remember, the man who waited for a miracle was a doctor.You and I are fragile. Just wet fluttering tissues.Stop building facades. Be whoever you want to be. Atheist. Religious. Fat. Thin. Rich. Poor. Famous. Obscured.It does not matter. Just Start living while you still can. Love more. Live more. Lose the hatred. Lose the arrogance.’Cause no matter how you choose to live, death beckons.","44,679 followers",Anshul Agarwal,10.3K,133,13.8M,2018,https://www.quora.com/I-just-got-out-of-prison-2-weeks-ago-and-I-am-living-with-a-friend-for-free-I-have-620-000-and-no-chance-of-getting-a-job-How-can-I-live-off-this-money

Mom, Dad, Deedo (i love calling her this), Me, Brother. She was born in 1991, me in 1996 and bro came to us in 2001. So, a gap of 5-years in 2 of us lead us in 3 different stages of life always, till date, unless all of us are adults.So, when i was in 6th standard and bro was in 1st, we had to bid goodbye to our didi to Chandigarh, 190 kms from our town, for her medical entrance exams coaching. You see, how little was he, 6.5 years old! And she was his favorite in house. He used to cry every evening missing her to be home. I used to sit beside her and chatter about my day for a long time and used to go to her taking every little problem, from personal to fights with bro to my homework and drawings, she would do it all. And now, i was the elder kid in home. That sucked. I barely used to talk to her on phone, as i just used to sit beside mom and listen to her conversation with Deedo, reason being, she had to study and i was an introvert. She used to visit us every 2.5 months only for 2 days, and used to cry everytime i bid her goodbye and take a promise from her that next time she would come soon. But no, to get something we have to lose. Papa Mumma missed her a lot, of course. Papa's favourite child. <3 Haha, and we were always happy with that. :)Okay, time passed, 2008, with God's grace, she got a great rank in All India Medical test exams for UG, she got MBBS in Bangalore Medical College and Research Institute, Bangalore. This time, 2024 kms away, but we were happy. Didi was going to be a Doctor. She used to visit us after every year for 15 days and we grew up almost without her. She graduated in March,2014, when i passed my 12th and bro was now in 7th standard. You see, he entered in teenage and me in adulthood, almost without her.Then she started to prepare for her MD entrance exams but luck didn't favour her for the first attempts.Decided to try again, second time and this time, she did a job for 6 months in Government hospital, 32 sector, Chandigarh to gain some experience, and to freshen up her mind from constant studying. This time,2015, she didn't get a rank of her choice so she decided to try again. Not an easy-peasy task, only medicos know this. Hats off to them!2016, second attempt, again, she wanted to clear for AIIMS or PGI, Chandigarh or a good government college in All India exam. Her wish, though, was to in AIIMS.But, 2017, not yet.3 years of her constant struggle, hard work and we had to be away from her. Why? Because in these 3 years, even when she was in home, no one from us was allowed to go her room. But we were happy, at least she was with us.I am a naughty kid at home (officially an adult but I'm a kid at home). I just used to open her room steadily, smile like an idiot, say Hi! And come back.Thank God🙏🏻2018, she got AIIMS, Delhi, her dream college and now she is in second year MD (obstetrics and gynaecology) working from 7 am in morning till 11 pm or sometimes even late till, 1 or 2 am. Holidays? Doctors don't get that. Okay, once per month. Since then 2018 , she has got home twice, once for one day and this time for 2-3 days. But, since Delhi, is an overnight journey, we get to go there sometimes.Brother is now 18.5 Years old, I'm almost 24, Missing her since 11 years. We love her like anything.Being doctor ain't easy.

Investors can organize their investing plans according to their targets and aspirations.Here are some good investment strategies that you can follow as a new investor?The holding tenure was determined by the amount of value that investors wanted to add to their portfolios. Investors will invest in companies that they anticipate will grow in the next years, enhancing the underlying value of their shares. Growth investment is another term for this. Investors, on the other hand, can choose short-term holding if they anticipate a company will produce good value in a year or two. Investors' choices influence the holding period. For instance, how swiftly they want money to buy a house, send their children to school, plan for retirement, and so on.Since some companies are undervalued by the stock market, value investing involves investing in them based on their inherent value. The concept behind investing in such companies is that when the market goes through a correction, the value of such undervalued companies will be adjusted, and the price would surge, leaving investors with large returns when they sell.Note:-Warren Buffet, a well-known investor, implements this method.","135,555 followers",Hector Quintanilla,10.6K,1.2K,88.6M,2006,https://www.quora.com/I-just-got-out-of-prison-2-weeks-ago-and-I-am-living-with-a-friend-for-free-I-have-620-000-and-no-chance-of-getting-a-job-How-can-I-live-off-this-money

Those are just a few of the many investment strategies out there to choose from. This guide will break down the major investment strategies and help you decide which of them is likely to be a good choice for you.How to Choose an Investment StrategyThere are a number of factors that go into choosing the investment strategy that will work best for you. One thing is to think about whether you want to choose an active or passive investing strategy. Active investing involves the frequent buying and selling of stocks. It requires hands-on management, often by a portfolio manager who can delve into various factors to forecast the market.Passive strategies, on the other hand, are focused on buying and holding investments for the long haul. Proponents of passive strategies argue this cuts down on trading costs and increases tax efficiency. It also tends to be less risky than market-timing strategies, which can reap big rewards by trying to beat the market but also suffer big losses. Oftentimes, portfolios will blend active and passive investing.All the resources you need to seamlessly flow through the experience of Mining with profit,Trading and Crypto Investment 24/7,also has a free bitcoin miming software and free Trading Bot software.A reliable technology platform and very easiest,most convenient platform for both beginners and cryptocurrency enthusiasts.They are a non-custodial platform, meaning that your crypto is secured.(www.cryptosbinary,com) made a breakdown of some of the most promising cryptocurrency tokens/coins that are most likely to birth highly attractive profits on ROI percentage profit after 10 days for both traders and investorsOther factors you need to consider are your time horizon, such as how close you are to major life events like buying a house, having children or retiring. If you need income soon, you may not want to select long-term investments, for instance. Your risk tolerance is another consideration. Generally, you can tolerate more risk early in your career, and desire less risky, more stable investments as you move towards retirement. A strategy like income investing, which is based on generating a steady income, might be less risky than more subjective strategy like value investing.Growth InvestingGrowth investing is an investment strategy that focuses on building capital through buying equities that have the potential to increase in value. This is most commonly found in stocks where investors believe the value of the company, and thus the value of the shares they’ve purchased, is likely to go up.Growth investing contains several sub-strategies. Two of the most common are short-term investments and long-term investments. Short-term generally means buying stocks and holding them for less than a year. Investors use short-term growth investments when they think a company’s value is likely to shoot up quickly. Long-term investments, on the other hand, are held for more than a year. Investors use these when they believe the company’s value will grow slowly and steadily over the years.Growth investing can touch on numerous sectors, such as:Emerging marketsTechEnergyAerospaceValue InvestingValue investing, an investment strategy championed by Warren Buffett, focuses on seeking out stocks that you believe are intrinsically undervalued. By finding companies the market does not properly value, investors have the potential to post big gains when the market eventually corrects and the company becomes valued properly.
