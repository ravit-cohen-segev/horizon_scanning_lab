It was a pretty amazing time though and I learned some incredible lessons.How does this relate to cryptocurrency?What we are witnessing is literally the exact same technological cycle all over again. We are seeing massive levels of development all around the world. Companies investing billions towards making the blockchain a permanent part of our reality and whether most people know it, chances are they’ll be using something based on the blockchain (likely tied to a cryptocurrency) in their everyday life some years from now.There are enough companies, enough large investors, enough faith and confidence by those in the know, for me to sit back and just ride the train.We’re down a bit right now.. in some cases a lot.. but that’s just the nature of the game.I see the future and it’s bright. The question is, are you holding the right coins?",0 followers,Gerhard Walter,765,54,915.7K,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-makes-you-believe-in-cryptocurrency-especially-when-the-market-is-struggling-to-see-green
1,"I think both the other answers have merit and are the proper analysis, but they don’t get at the core point: people believe in crypto because they believe in blockchain. The technology will not be denied. That’s the bottom line: if you think blockchain is still on course to redefine electronic communication, then for the most part you should still believe in crypto.That said, it’s unclear to me still HOW MANY or WHICH coins will remain integral to their blockchain processes, at least from an investor’s standpoint. Obviously there will be a currency-based chain that will win out, but will it beI think both the other answers have merit and are the proper analysis, but they don’t get at the core point: people believe in crypto because they believe in blockchain.

Obviously there will be a currency-based chain that will win out, but will it be Bitcoin or something else like Dash or Monroe? And what of the coins that are mostly just “gas” for the systems behind them? People trade commodities, but they’re not the same kind of get rich transactions people think of for equities.So the real question is do people still believe in blockchain? The answer is still yes.",27 followers,Benjamin Price,1.1K,0,0,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-makes-you-believe-in-cryptocurrency-especially-when-the-market-is-struggling-to-see-green
2,"I don’t believe, but verify the facts.Do you remember what people were saying about the Internet toward the end of the ’80s and early ‘90s?Everyone was bashing it real hard and the naysayers were running victory laps every time that new technology hit a road bump.What happened next? The Internet set a new world standard and was the sole reason for the paradigm shift. It went from the Internet 1.0 to the Internet 2.0.Think of theI don’t believe, but verify the facts.Do you remember what people were saying about the Internet toward the end of the ’80s and early ‘90s?Everyone was bashing it real hard and the naysayers were running victory laps every time that new technology hit a road bump.What happened next?

They will take the world to the a new level.As you can see, the pattern is the same. There’s plenty of sceptics and people that laugh it off today. They, just like the folks who laughed off the Internet 1.0, will be left behind.Crypto goes beyond belief. It’s a conviction and if you do your own research, you will arrive at similar conclusions.Good luck.",18 followers,Asim Qureshi,1.4K,996,156.1M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-makes-you-believe-in-cryptocurrency-especially-when-the-market-is-struggling-to-see-green
