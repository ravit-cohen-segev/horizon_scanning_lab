It is comfortable to read the oldies, but we should make room for the new, too. There are a lot of amazing writers on here. So many for us to discover. Just today I started following someone new after getting a recommendation from a friend. Glad I did.I remember when there used to be music stores. Yes, there was such a thing. They were great. Often the clerk was a guy who absolutely loved music. He knew everything. And he was always listening to new artists who weren’t widely known. He would make a recommendation, and you could listen while you were there. It was great. Quora is like that.I have also done a deep dive into the work of some popular Quorans whom I really respect as writers. Some of the popular writers deserve the recognition they receive.

With 2019 being one quarter over and there being no mention of a 2019 Top Writer program, and no announcement of delay, it may well mean the program is discontinued.That would be a shame. Quora writers aren’t compensated for the content they produce, so the biggest motivation to continue producing content is the sense of community. Quora does appear to have been stepping back from the strong community they established during Quora’s early days. Tatiana Estévez had to discontinue her Quora blog where Quora writers could vent to each other about Quora frustrations. And when Marc Bodnick left, it felt like the line of communication between Quora and its contributors disappeared. Marc was omnipresent and would jump into every thread if he sensed a Quora contributor was unhappy. He was constantly asking us for ideas on how to improve the site. That made us feel not just contributors, but partners in an effort to build something cool.I recently realized that I haven’t followed anyone new, in quite a while. The Quora Top Writer program was a great way for me to be alerted about good writers. I could go through the list of people that had been selected and follow the ones that wrote content that appealed to me.

The price was sky high, have issues around privacy, and cultural backlash, this wearable product was not able to connect.2. Tata Nano, Tata Motors (2008)Tata Motors launched the Nano cars with motorcyclists in mind. Tata manufactured the Nano as inexpensively as possible. The price was 100,000 rupees in 2008.However, due to the low prices the company has to cut corners in production, as a result, there were many serious safety flaws. There were some reports that Nanos were bursting into flames after rear collisions. Tata ultimately sold fewer than 8000 Nanons in 2016–17. Due to low sales, Tata Motors announced the end of production without any direct successor. (Only one was assembled in June 2018).3. Facebook Phone, Facebook (2013)The Facebook Phone was surrounded by speculation from the moment the first rumors of it is surfaced. What the public got was HTC first, an android skinned device whose main feature was being geared towards the Facebook Home application. The phones exclusive carrier, AT&T, drastically slashed the price to 99 cents in a “temporary sale” that became permanent until the phone’s death.4. Juicero, Juicero (2013)Juicero was a California-based startup that raised $120M for its fresh-squeezed juice device. But after it was found that its $400, Wi-Fi-enabled machines were no more effective at making juice than squeezing the pre-packaged fruit with your hands, the company shut down within months of its launch.5. Google+, Google (2011-2019)Google+ isn’t the only social outing on this list from the search giant, but it’s probably the highest-profile disappointment. A closed launch made invites a hot commodity for about a week. Then Google discarded their restrained invitation model, throwing open the doors in an attempt to build a user base that never lived up to their expectations of creating a possible Facebook competitor. Google+ was shuttered permanently on April 2, 2019.6. Windows Vista, Microsoft (2007)We all have used the Windows operating system for at least one time in our life. Windows XP was quite successful and about 5 years after the launch of Windows XP, they launched Windows Vista.After review on Vista, it was found out that this is not so user-friendly OS. Microsoft accepted its mistakes and announced to offer XP instead of vista to all the computer manufacturers. Many users downgraded their OS from Vista to XP. It hastened production on Windows 7.7. Windows Phone, Microsoft (2010)Microsoft made up its mind to launch Windows Phone but took a very late step in the world of smartphones. Apple Phones had already created a great impact in the smartphone world. Android phones were already in the market for 2 years. All these things created the problems for Microsoft.The Windows Phone represented less than 1% of the total smartphone market in 2017, according to Recode — Microsoft discontinued the development of new features for the device that same year.The former Nokia engineer said:There are many well-known factors that caused WP’s demise, none of them alone took it down, but here are the ones that stood out most to me:8. Apple Newton (1993–1998)A PDA (personal digital assistant) that suffered from a poorly functioning operating system, the Apple Newton never caught on. However, the development of Apple Newton did indirectly lead to the iPad, proving that learning from failure can lead to great success.9. BlackBerryBefore the iPhone, there was the BlackBerry — or “CrackBerry,” as the devices’ obsessed users affectionately referred to them. Blackberry phones were the first choice for many people and have features like Internet connection, email, chatting on Blackberry Messengers, and many more. Research in Motion, as BlackBerry, was then called, sold more than 50 million of the devices in 2011.Time passed and RIM did not have any changes, it kept up with its trademark physical keyboard and did not bring a full touchscreen like the iPhone. The touchscreen had become quite popular at that time and people were very fond of it.By 2016, BlackBerry was selling only about 4 million devices annually. Blackberry is still in this world but due to its archaic fervor, but one thing has to be accepted company’s devices paved the way for the super-powered smartphones we carry around today.10. MySpaceMyspace was originally launched as a side project. It became the most famous social networking site before Facebook enter the world. It was officially launched in 2004 and gained 1 million users in one month only. MySpace first try to ignore Facebook but later on started copying it.They have poorly designed their interface and faulty applications on the site. No doubt they have an amazing marketing strategy, but from the technical side, they were far behind from other platforms.Facebook and Twitter have continuously rolled out major changes, new features, and redesigned their UI that have helped them to reshaped the social web for better, whereas MySpace remained stagnant for most of the time and never made a comeback.11. SegwayPerhaps no gadget evokes the early turn of the century like the Segway, a personal motorized scooter that riders control by leaning in one direction or another. Designed as a revolutionary new transportation option, Segways have largely been relegated to the realm of the mall cop and tour group. But for whatever reason, technologists never tire of trying to replace the well-proven movement method of walking around — The Great Hoverboard Craze of 2015-16 can trace its origins directly to this stand-up scooter.Sources: 1)2)3)Image credits: Google.Thank you!",0 followers,Abhishek Raj,3.9K,62,665.5K,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-causes-a-lack-of-innovation-among-top-technological-companies

I can remember instances of getting an email from him at 1 or 2 in the morning, and then other times as early as 9pm and no response coming until the next morning.He was human, but there were times when you’d see him sitting and he’d be meditating and solving problems, then jump up refreshed and ready to go again.I never thought to ask him: Steve, one day people will want to know, how many hours a night you slept, what should I tell them?

27,"Nope, some people just need less sleep. I’ve worked with a half dozen executives at different firms who rarely slept more than 4 or 5 hours a night - even on their days off or on vacations.One particular CEO was just a machine - +80 hours a week and he never looked tired In 5 years of working together, I’ve never even seen him yawn - even after long grueling days when the rest of us mortals were ready to face plant. He would still be cranking out reports responding to email at midnight, and then he was up again at 4:30am at full speed like he just came off of vacation.A few of my colleagues trNope, some people just need less sleep.

We’d make a game of getting into the office ahead of him and park in his favorite spot as a friendly competition. I recognized the toll it was taking on me and pulled back a bit which cost me a promotion. My colleague who was promoted had a heart attack at 35. Fortunately he survived, and also was smart enough to seek a job with a better work life balance.I never got a sense that anyone of these executives were “dying inside” from lack of sleep. But being a peer or direct report to them certainly did.",320 followers,Dave Brunfeldt,687,2K,1.7M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Who-are-the-top-technology-writers-on-Quora
28,"Interestingly, I never caught more sleep than when I was in basic training. We had “lights out” at 22.00 and were woken up at 6.30. More than eight hours of sleep!Later on, it was much less. Not only because of military exercises but also because we were partying so much. When I attended the Non-Commissioned Officer course, it could happen that we returned from a night out only ten minutes before the wake up call.Later on, in the wars, sleep was a luxury. Three hours of uninterrupted sleep in a combat zone was the most I ever got.In addition to this, we often operated at night.
