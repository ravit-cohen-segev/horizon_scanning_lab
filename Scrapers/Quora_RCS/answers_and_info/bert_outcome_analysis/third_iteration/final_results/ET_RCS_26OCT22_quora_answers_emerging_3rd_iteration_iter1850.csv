0,"Not at the present time, but when a technology exists and has utility, people tend to create uses for it.You probably will never see 5G outside of heavily urbanized areas, because the millimeter-wave technology it is based on requires the use of “small cells”—base stations that have to be positioned every few hundred meters in order to provide network coverage. Millimeter waves also have a very difficult time penetrating through walls, even moreso than current LTE signals do.

Millimeter waves also have a very difficult time penetrating through walls, even moreso than current LTE signals do. This is why the only current 5G networks in existence are only in very large cities.However, there is always a use for faster wireless communication in urbanized areas, which tend to be the centers of business and commerce. Telecommunications companies already had one go at this back at the turn of the last decade with 4G WiMax technology—I even used a WiMax network for my home Internet service from 2010–13—but it wasn’t reliable and rarely achieved the promised connection speeds, which is why the technology was abandoned. But WiMax (IEEE 802.16) was basically WiFi technology on steroids, and 5G is very different. It uses a completely different part of the radio frequency spectrum and new propagation technologies, and it’s not only faster than any 4G, whether it be WiMax, HSPA+ or LTE, but also outperforms most WiFi networks, which means it can eliminate the need for a router; each machine can directly connect at high speed over the air.As 5G ramps up over the next several years, expect to see many articles about how the United States “lags behind” in its deployment, because most of the country won’t have access to these networks. This will, of course, be because the USA is an enormous country and most of it has low population density, making 5G deployment not cost-effective. Much of the country has nothing better than 3G and/or HSPA+ access, because even LTE signals don’t work well. (I didn’t even bother owning an LTE-capable phone until last year.) And most of us really don’t give two cents about having a car or a refrigerator that “phones home” or whatever, anyway.But for the places that are able to get 5G technology, you can bet they’re going to find ways to use it that the developers haven’t even thought of yet.","9,864 followers",Kenzi Mudge,1.8K,1.3K,8.3M,2019,https://www.quora.com/How-will-enrolling-5G-be-any-vital-for-any-upcoming-technologies-if-the-speeds-are-not-significantly-different-unless-you-re-near-a-transmitter
1,"Well, I am Deaf, and my wife is blind. That is not how we chose life, but that is the straws we drew.In many ways, I envy the fact that she can listen to music, talk on the phone, hear people talking in the other room, hear children giggle on the play ground, hear frogs, birds and things like that.She misses driving, watching a movie, seeing a sunset, seeing our grandchildren change as they grow up, and watching a young couple walk hand in hand in the park with a growing belly.But do you know what? The two of us have it made! Why? Because we have each other!While sitting on the beach, I tell hWell, I am Deaf, and my wife is blind.

Because we have each other!While sitting on the beach, I tell her of the fish jumping, the waves cresting, the sun setting and the beauty of the shells, the starfish and the amazing blue of the sky and ocean.She in turn tells me of the sound of the children playing, the pounding of the sea, the seagulls flying above calling to each other and as the sun is setting, she tells me of the people having fun on the beach with loud music, while we both enjoy the smell of the driftwood burning.Together, we are quite a team.What is the most difficult? To me, it would be to not have a mate that would help me experience as well as share the world around me like the wonderful bride that I have in my life. No matter if they are hearing, deaf, or otherwise. Now into our 50’s, we are each others best friend, and I would not have it any other way!Best to you and yours!",72 followers,Glen Kim,641,88,795K,2019,https://www.quora.com/How-will-enrolling-5G-be-any-vital-for-any-upcoming-technologies-if-the-speeds-are-not-significantly-different-unless-you-re-near-a-transmitter
2,"I’ve been getting 2022 car reviews in my youtube feed for the past few weeks.

Some people found it to he a breach of their privacy as some complete stranger with the Google Glass can take a photo or video of them without them knowing. That's understandable, that's a pretty weird and creepy thing to do.Most movie theaters also banned them for fear of people illegally recording movies. Casinos also banned them because people didn't appreciate surreptitious recording.Health ConcernsWas itTrue, phones also emitted harmful radiation, but they weren't in direct contact with your skin for pretty much the whole day.Aesthetically UnappealingLook at the first generation Google Glass. What is that thing? It's essentially a frame with one lens that's just a small rectangle pretty much just floating there. Even the frame is uncomfortably thin, it feels like it will snap with one wrong move.The new generation is somewhat more aesthetically pleasing, but its reputation has already been tarnished.Still in BetaSeriously, is it really still in beta? When was it announced? 2012? Technically had been worked on sinceWith what we get out of the box, the price tag is so unjustified.No Clear FunctionOk cool, I can take a photo of something if I forget my phone at home. Or I can take a video of a crime happening in front of me. Oh, I forgot the definition of a word, let me just use my Google Glass real quick.Other than simple “issues” our phones can solve, what's its other purposes?Don't know about you, but I can't think of anything else other than “I just bought a $1,500 useless piece of tech”. As a fashion statement? Lol, I think we're getting too ahead of ourselves.To sum it up,Until Google starts to actually make progress with the Google Glass, lowers its price tag (still think $999 isThe only people that bought it were people that had money to blow, and tech YouTubers that only bought it so it can be reviewed.One can argue thatThough it is to some degree, I don't think it's a total flop.VR Headsets are starting to make a comeback and they aren't that bad, actually.I think the biggest issue that's holding it back from success is the lack of content.If more content are pushed out, with amazing graphics, then I'm sure VR Headsets/Goggles will be something big.I mean,",18 followers,Asim Qureshi,3.5K,996,156M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-just-around-the-corner-tech-are-you-eager-to-get-your-hands-on

Tech startups became a ready recipient as a number of novel ideas like Uber, We Work and Airbnb shook traditional industries and led to one of the longest economic expansions.The deluge of capital had a huge side effect — it led to a massive gap between early stage funding and late stage funding. There was a massive amount of capital waiting to be put in startups and VCs could not put them in smaller companies as they didn’t have the bandwidth to spread the billions in a large number of startups.Rather they went all-in in a few large bets. They had so much money to invest that they literally begged these large startups to take their money. This pushed away the need for these large companies to seek public capital through IPO and also disregard any kind of financial discipline. Unlike the Venture Funded startups of the earlier eras [such as early 2000s] — a certain recklessness was encouraged by dumb money that was trying to enter smart startups.While this was happening, funding in Series A [a traditional sweetspot for the VCs until 12 years ago] dropped relatively and that means fewer startups were groomed and made available for the later stage investors. By abandoning their traditional job of helping build young companies, a lot of investors sought a few well groomed startups — pushing their values up to insanity and brought megalomania in their founders.We are now facing a big gulf of haves and have-nots. A lot of very good companies who have become bad financially due to massive amount of capital on one side and another group of struggling startups to raise money for Series A post their seed funding. One side is over-valued and the other side under-valued.",0 followers,Lucas Martin,6.4K,65,4.2M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-just-around-the-corner-tech-are-you-eager-to-get-your-hands-on
