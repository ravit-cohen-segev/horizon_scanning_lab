1,"Pilot error covers a broad territory - anything from mistakes and oversights by a pilot, to highly cognitive errors such as a lapse of judgement or a decision making that goes wrong. A computer could perhaps, automate the systems well enough to compensate the mistakes and oversights (as a part of the autopilot system). However, unless we formulate AI that can accurately reproduce human cognition, I doubt it would ever be feasible to completely replace pilots with computer.During a British Airways flight over Indonesia, a volcano erupted in Java and the magnetic ash resulted in all the four engPilot error covers a broad territory - anything from mistakes and oversights by a pilot, to highly cognitive errors such as a lapse of judgement or a decision making that goes wrong. A computer could perhaps, automate the systems well enough to compensate the mistakes and oversights (as a part of the autopilot system). However, unless we formulate AI that can accurately reproduce human cognition, I doubt it would ever be feasible to completely replace pilots with computer.During a British Airways flight over Indonesia, a volcano erupted in Java and the magnetic ash resulted in all the four engines shutting down (It was a Boeing 744). It was the pilot's ingenuity that saved the plane (and the passengers) from an imminent crash. Also, everytime there is a mechanical error, like a landling gear that refuses to deploy during landing - it is requires a very human level of decision making and creativity to save the souls in the aircraft. A incident in Iran in a Boeing 727 piloted by Hooshang Shabazi is a good example.While flying in Central Asia, I heard a story from a Russian stewardess about an incident where the fuses of the flight instrument in a Tu-154 blew off. The cockpit went black. The pilot and flight engineer had rush to the kitchen and rip open the heater, to use the fuses that saved the day.While flying in Central Asia, I heard a story from a Russian stewardess about an incident where the fuses of the flight instrument in a Tu-154 blew off. The cockpit went black. The pilot and flight engineer had rush to the kitchen and rip open the heater, to use the fuses that saved the day.So no, having been a commercial pilot for almost six years, I have learnt enough about flying to understand that we are far from automating entire flights - especially considering that human lives are still not as disposable as say - a sack of mail.I am no longer working as a pilot, but if I were to fly as a passenger, I'd refuse to board any plane that doesn't have at least one qualified human pilot. Unless of course, we find ourselves in an era where machines can match the cognition of the human brain.",17 followers,Randy Duncan,3.7K,1.1K,34.1M,2014,https://www.quora.com/Would-passenger-airlines-be-safer-without-human-pilots

4,"There will be people coming out saying “something that huge standing in the field will be a bullet magnet yada yada” so I shall be the contrarian voice today.Tank design is determined by the balancing of power plant, armor and guns. Power plant will determine how heavy the tank can be, and you try to work out the best balance between armor protection and size of the gun. If you have more armor, you will have less gun, and vice versa. If you give up on both, you will get more speed.The performance of tanks in a given age and technology level is not stupendously different from country to countryThere will be people coming out saying “something that huge standing in the field will be a bullet magnet yada yada” so I shall be the contrarian voice today.Tank design is determined by the balancing of power plant, armor and guns. Power plant will determine how heavy the tank can be, and you try to work out the best balance between armor protection and size of the gun. If you have more armor, you will have less gun, and vice versa. If you give up on both, you will get more speed.The performance of tanks in a given age and technology level is not stupendously different from country to country. Right now, with our technology today, we can make a tank carry a 120mm gun and enough armor to reasonably withstand a frontal shot from a similar gun, and still do around 70kph on the road.Mobile Suits are made from technology that makes today’s engines look like a WWII vintage. It is not based on an internal combustion mechanism, but something far more powerful (and obviously not scientifically describable today.) Therefore, the total package of armament, armor and speed is completely beyond today’s capabilities.One more thing to note is, there is technology to make any long range sensors and radio communication fail. So literally, you will not know an incoming hostile until it is on top of you.To give you an example, think of a unit that can hover above ground at 240km/h, with armor that will treat 120mm cannon rounds like a pea shooter plus supplemental armor carried in the form of a shield, and a gun that either shoots 120mm like a GAU-8 (which is considered severely lacking against peers in that age) or a single shot gun that shoots something to be expected of a naval vessel… That can jump over buildings, is completely terrain neutral, and can be piloted by a crew of 1, and can point and shoot with the speed of infantry.This thing is coming at you from somewhere but you can’t radio anyone beyond 5–10km and there is no J-STARS, aerial recon, CAS or anything like that. Average MS is about 18 meters tall standing, but it can kneel or go prone at will. Few meters in height will also give the benefit of early detection against any incoming threats because almost any detection is done by Eyeball Mark 1 assisted with telescopes.But wait, you may say. If you have such awesome power plants, why don’t you just make a bigger tank with bigger guns and more armor?It has been tried. YMT-05 Hildolfr. Packs a massive 30cm gun and 10.5㎝ machine guns as supplemental armament. Can run on rough terrain at 110kph. It is essentially a tank with a MS power plant. It was tested against a group of MS and performed decently, but lost. Here is the full account.At the end of the day, conventional “tanks” fights in 2 dimensions. It does poorly against weapon systems that are fundamentally built for 3d combat. People who grew up in space fundamentally thinks in 3DFederation RTX 440 - another test model that put more emphasis on mobility over firepower compared to the Hildofr. This fared relatively well against mobile suit units.Conventional 21st century thinking would say that the ability to hide, detect the enemy first and hit on the first shot, is the most important for survival. This has been an ongoing trend since knights gave up their armor and line infantry gave way to Jager units on the field.But UC is a time in history where radar and other long range sensors became unusable. Under such conditions, engagement range are far, far closer than what we are used to in the 21st century, and therefore maneuverability and protection became the most important factor for survival. The bi-pedal model pushed out the mobility/armor/armament envelope further out beyond what was possible in weapons designed for a different age.","4,230 followers",Joseph Reinemann,4.1K,14.9K,37.1M,2017,https://www.quora.com/Would-passenger-airlines-be-safer-without-human-pilots

Starting in 2010 the University of California Irvine developed the UCI 30:A list ofNow this hand held scanner made the doctors job much easier - trainees were even finding things their instructors missed because they had the right tools. But the program was limited because the scanner cost $150,000 and patient care must always take a backseat to shareholder profit. That third yacht isn’t going to buy itself after all.Now ultrasound systems have been around for quite a while, but they usually look more like this:(2008 model)These things are the size of a filing cabinet, weigh around 200 lbs and cost as much as a house because “well, it worked well enough in 1980 and RnD work is expensive son! Why should the executives at GE do any work? We’ve got lots of golf to play and the hospitals keep buying our existing product. No need to improve here.”If you were to crack open the back of this machine what you would find inside is not a desktop PC running software, you’d instead find a large metal cabinet with bread boards slotted into it. Below is a picture from the repair manual for my ultrasound machine:Yeah, they’re that primitive. It would be like going to a car dealership and hearing: “Try our new model! It’s got front and rear drum brakes, twin carburetors and you can even get air conditioning if you buy the most expensive trim!”Yeah.Fortunately those $150,000 scanners aren’t selling well anymore because someone who actually gives a &%#% about their patients went out and did some RnD work to develop their own scanner:The Butterfly IQ ultrasound scanner costs $2000, fits in one hand, displays on a smartphone, is HIPA compliant and scans for two hours on a battery charge. The designer also figured out how to replace the old piezo electric crystals with a printed chip that lets one scan head operate over the complete frequency range thus eliminating the need for multiple probe heads:Yeah, all these different probes that can only work one frequency band due to restrictions on their piezoelectric design? The new chip does all their jobs in one.So how is it going?Well, putting cheap ultrasound into competent hands has been shown to improve clinical outcomes, cut hospital stays and save lives.Many stodgy old doctors (who were never trained on ultrasound and don’t want to learn) take the attitude that they’ve managed just fine and don’t need some new toy:And it’s true that working blind can be impressive:But when it’s your body and your loved ones on the line, if your doctor walks in wearing a blindfold I suspect you’ll have a problem with this.So the next time you see your doctor or visit the emergency room, take a moment to ask if they’re using portable ultrasound yet. If you get a blank look or a finger pointed to a filing cabinet sized machine you just found out that you’re dealing with the doctor in the picture above. Price is no longer an obstacle; the only reason you’ll find the above situation is if you’re dealing with a truly clueless or callus organization, and neither is particularly comforting.For those who want to know more, the University of California training classes on how to read an ultrasound are available asBest wishes, and don’t be shy about pushing this issue with your provider.
