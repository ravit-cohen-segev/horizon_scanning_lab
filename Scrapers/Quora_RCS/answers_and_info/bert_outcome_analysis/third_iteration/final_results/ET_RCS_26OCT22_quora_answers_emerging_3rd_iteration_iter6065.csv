0,"Is it possible to raise your IQ by 100 points?Absolutely, no problem at all.Providing that you can start from the Stanford-Binet average IQ of 100, you should be able to add 1 point a day to your IQ. Easy Peasy.That means that within say 150 days (say 20 weeks) you should be up to IQ 250 which is at least 20 points higher than the highest estimation of Goethe’s IQ - Nietzsche's embodiment of the Ubermensch.IQ 250 should be fine for solving any of the world’s problems that still remain unsolved in 20 weeks or so time.However, nothing in life is free.

1,"I have an IQ that fits within the 140–150 range and to be absolutely honest, I'd prefer 10 points less. I was a lot happier a person when I knew and understood less, that's why it was so easy for me to be happy as a kid. The small things such as being given chocolate or going to a friend's house was just so exciting for me. Similar to a dog that is just so overwhelmingly happy for simple things such as when their owner comes home or when they get a small treat. As I've grown older, the simplistic things don't seem to matter as much, because I am well aware that in the grand scheme of things, iI have an IQ that fits within the 140–150 range and to be absolutely honest, I'd prefer 10 points less.

As I've grown older, the simplistic things don't seem to matter as much, because I am well aware that in the grand scheme of things, it really doesn't matter so much. I'd say the more intelligent you are, the more difficulty you have stimulating your brain and as a result, the more difficult it becomes to make yourself happy. Maybe this is just a result of getting older, but I can't help but feel like the less intelligent people in our society have a lot less worries and concerns plaguing their lives.",18 followers,Asim Qureshi,8.5K,996,156M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Are-there-any-experimental-treatments-that-can-increase-IQ-by-10-or-so-points-What-about-emerging-technologies

4,"If you can’t explain it simply, you don’t understand it well enough.ILet us assume that there are two people Alice and Bob.

Alice borrows some money from Bob and Bob writes it on a piece of paper signed by Alice. After some days Alice denies the existence of such document and claims that Bob has forged that piece of paper. Bob would now find it difficult to prove that Alice actually owes him Money.In this example Alice and Bob are two nodes.Now assume the same scenario, but among a society. So there are ’k’ pair of people transacting with each other. And the only proof that each pair has, is that piece of paper. Looking at this scenario, one person, Kate comes up with a solution. She suggests maintaining a common notebook of transaction for entire society. She designates town hall to be the place where every exchange takes place. In the common notebook, every pair writes the transaction and then the notebook is kept safely. People rejoice and accept Kate as their leader.That notebook can be called aBut one day, somebody spills wine on the notebook. This makes the notebook illegible. Taking the advantage of this situation, Alice again denies taking money from Bob.This is the problem databases face -Irritated by this problem, Kate comes up with another solution. She suggests maintaining multiple notebooks. She chooses some trustworthy people from the society and gives them a notebook each. Now every time a transaction or exchange takes place between two people, Kate instructs some of those trustworthy people to mention the transaction in their notebooks. So the data is repeated in the notebooks. Now, even if one notebook is destroyed, chances are that all the data regarding transactions are still present in the combination of other notebooks.This is aBut next day, another problem arises. Kate has a friend named Bert who owes a lot of money to some people in the society. He asks Kate for help and she agrees to help him. She instructs all the people with the notebooks to remove the entries where Bert received money. Now Bert doesn’t owe any money based on the notebooks.This is theWhen the people from the society come to know of it, they remove Kate from the leadership.So, well. This is the easiest example I can think of to explain Blockchain. Blockchain is a decentralized, peer to peer, immutable storage network which is censor free and regulator free because of the absence of one single controlling entity. Every transaction that is written is voted upon by a majority of nodes and changing something which was written before in the chain is computationally very difficult.","31,157 followers",Phillip Remaker,1.7K,11K,78.8M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Are-there-any-experimental-treatments-that-can-increase-IQ-by-10-or-so-points-What-about-emerging-technologies
5,"The proposal most Futurists that I follow is that we’ll need to extend education and institute a universal basic income.We’ve been through several industrial revolutions in the past and each has shifted jobs substantially.

6,"200 Years ago 90% of the population worked on farms. Farm automation took over almost all of those jobs and today about 5% pf the population works on farms. Why do we not have 80% unemployment?What happens is that it is easy for anyone to think of low-skill jobs that might be automated but it is MUCH harder to think of the new jobs that might be created in the future. It has always been that way.

7,I suspect that a lot of the folks who might be cashiers today have already switched to doing deliveries for Amazon or some other company.Lots of boomers like myself still would rather talk to a cashier than scan stuff.

9,"The real reason why customer service agents hate their jobs is because it’s essentially a “bitch job” (excuse the term, but it’s just my opinion). Sure, it’s an important aspect of every company, but realistically, customer service is just an entry level job and positions are often filled by temp agencies (I know, because I was there before).To me, being a customer service agent, I felt like I was the equivalent to a front line soldier.

Sure, it’s an important aspect of every company, but realistically, customer service is just an entry level job and positions are often filled by temp agencies (I know, because I was there before).To me, being a customer service agent, I felt like I was the equivalent to a front line soldier. Since I was a temp, I was basically more or less a mercenary (as in I was not really a part of the company and I was disposable). Imagine a medieval battle, you are basically the infantry guy who has to stand there and just take the incoming charges; wave after wave of enemies, which equates to phone call after phone call. It got (mentally) exhausting and I got burned out fast.Needless to say, it was not a glamorous profession. In my opinion, customer service is often viewed as the lowest level department on the totem pole in almost every company. You don’t get respect by from the other departments and once I overheard a lady in another department say “I would rather gouge my eyes out than have to be stuck on the phone, saying the same thing over and over again like a broken record.” (I’m sure she had it a lot easier than we did).As a customer service rep, you are a peon strapped to a headset that you are not allowed to remove, and your phone system has to be turned on at all times. You literally answer hundreds of calls a day, pretty much non stop until break time. Imagine doing this while observing people in virtually other department being able to listen to music or a podcast and even watch Netflix while they are working. Believe me, the envy was there.Speaking of envy… When you see people from other departments just walking around and being able to take their laptops and work just about anywhere, because they don’t have to be wear a headset all day, it makes you kinda hate your job even more.Don’t get me wrong, customer service was a good starter job and I was truly humbled by the experience, but I hated every moment of it. Eventually I was able to move on, but I will never forget the feeling each day: the burn out, the desire for a better job, the soul crushing feeling of inadequacy and inferiority. Other people might have a different opinion, but this is mine and it was all mostly negative. I pray every day that I will never have to go back to it ever again.",114 followers,Hemant Sharma,16.7K,151,2.5M,2017,https://www.quora.com/How-can-companies-begin-to-work-with-emerging-technology-called-blockchain
