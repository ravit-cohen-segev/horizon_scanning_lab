Once you realize that technology is a business enabler and not the other way around, you'll quickly realize you are perfectly fine as long as you know what your organization's business is. Chasing the latest technology fad is fun; however if it doesn't enhance your business goals and help achieve business objectives - its of no use.So, as a CTO your job is not code or to learn to implement the latest and greatest technology, but to harness it to enhance your organization's business objectives.",256 followers,Priyal Gupta,9.7K,0,0,2015,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-top-mobile-app-development-trends-in-2019

That should tell you what I think of that lingo, that fits right into the PM vocabulary alongside “deliverable” and “resource”.“Stacks” are defined very subjectively, you know. Let alone the “full-stack” label arbitrarily slapped on resumes and LinkedIn profiles along with other self-stated epithets like “effective”, “proven”, and “experienced”. I’ve even seen, I am not kidding you, a few individuals calling themselves visionaries on LinkedIn. So you know more than one programming language? JavaScript for the browser UI and Python for the “back end”? Followed by, OMG, SQL? Woo-hoo. Here’s your cookie.The problem I have with a “full stack developer”:from the employer’s perspective, is that my customers need their automation problems solved: 100% - by delivering a complete, let alone working system or service, while an FSD assessment only states that someone is above the code monkey who knows just one technology: A. Being proficient in A, B, and C doesn’t guarantee the problem solved, because there may be D or E outside of a particular “stack”. Does anyone even specify what stack he/she is “full” of? (pun intended) Ever seen “full MERN stack developer” or “full LAMP stack developer” in resumes and LinkedIn profiles?Sure, an FSD can cover 40 or even 60% of work compared to e.g. 15% code monkey does. Zero actually due to negative performance (100% rework by someone else), but that’s a separate topic, so let’s be optimistic and pretend to believe bodyshop-supplied “bodies” are hired to write working code instead of log man-hours for staffing middlemen. 60% is still not good enough. It doesn’t solve the customer’s problem. I’d need to hire someone else hoping he/she would cover another 40%. Rarely the case. In my experience it’s been 60% of the 40% and so on, and so forth.Sorry for being Captain Obvious, ‘stacks” don’t solve problems. Nor “science”, “algorithms”, or anything else we get cookies for from out teachers in the grade school and college, sadly extended to college exam style interviews at reputable software companies. I have no problem with perfect GPA scholars. Just show me, that you are capable of delivering a complete solution instead of brandishing stacks, “hot” abbreviations, and education credentials. Those who follow me here know what I am talking about: the portfolio.Don’t be a “full-stack developer” or “architect”.Be a generalist, who unconditionally solves the customer’s problem - by delivering the entire application. Whether alone or with the team, doesn’t matter. It means, that you can take onOnce you get into that mindset, you’ll see, that the task is not as daunting, as your non-technical bosses portray your projects, looking mysterious and difficult for them. If you are a true engineer, enjoying your work, you like getting inside complex things and figuring out how they work. To make them orders of magnitude simpler and better. It’s an engineering problem: researching, planning, and executing.Think about it. After fixing enough tough bugs, related to tricky contradictory business logic, you end up knowing the domain better than any (sorry for the quotes) “SME” or business user.After enough workarounds you know more about the right tools for the job, than your vague “Solution Architect” (or the rest of them: “application”, “data”, etc.). You are de-facto THE architect.You’ve always known SQL (or Mongo’s JSON-based language) and are intimately aware of all performance bottlenecks, that warrant indexes and denormalization. So why you need a DBA, especially for a Cloud-managed database?The same goes for DevOps. Cloud deployment is a one-click activity nowadays. Assuming it is a minimalistic clean self-contained deployment. See, all those technician jobs only (attempt to) recover from the developer’s incompetence. Google-quality code (together with Cloud) eliminates them in most, but Google and Facebook-size projects.You have a good eye for clean UI: a combination of padding, text, images, and icons, arranged in a uniform manner. You are developing a clean minimalistic data entry application, not a flashy online brochure website. Most of the look and feel can either be done once, or already exists e.g. as some Bootstrap “admin theme”. Think you still need a UI designer? Let alone some “UI developer”, that only knows JavaScript?And finally, forgive me for being such a “rebel”, with all roles consolidated into one, it’ll be either you alone or a tight team of generalist experts: 10–100x smaller than your current one of narrow specialists pigeonholed into their abbreviations they were hired for. Wouldn’t you be able to almost telepathically “communicate” and “collaborate” with a few smart colleagues? See, who else you don’t need? That’s right. Your boss aka “manager”.A generalist turns every project into an efficient “startup”. Why the fuck not? Assuming it’s important to solve the (customer’s) problem rather than spend the IT department budget with a typical 70–90% chance of failure. Also assuming you get rewarded for your effort.IT Meritocracy.

10,"Yes, broadly speaking, Russia is decades ahead of the US in missile technology. Russian air defense systems like the S-400, Tor and Pantsir are the best in the world at their respective tasks. The S-400 can handle up to 80 different targets at ranges of up to 250 miles. The only comparable system in the world is America’s AEGIS used in its destroyers and cruisers, however there is no other land-based system capable of matching the S-400. The Tor and Buk are both point defense systems that can be tethered to the S-400 and integrated with it.

The Tor and Buk are both point defense systems that can be tethered to the S-400 and integrated with it. They are designed primarily to defend military installations against cruise missiles and other munitions. There are no comparable systems in the West.Russia’s Iskander missile is by far the most advanced tactical, ballistic missile on the planet. It is capable of striking targets, including moving targets, to within 5 m despite the fact that the missile travels at mach 7 and maneuvers violently in flight to throw off air defenses. Ground-launched variants of the Iskander are believed to have a range of 1000 km, over 3x as much as the US’s equivalent: the ATACMS missile It is also the basis for the Kinzhal air-launched hypersonic missile.Russia is also the first country to deploy an air-breathing, hypersonic cruise missile: the Zircon. The missile is capable of reaching speeds of mach 9, with a range of 1000 km. Although the Zircon has already entered service with the Russian armed forces, the US estimates that it will be about a decade before they deploy a similar missile.Lastly, Russia is about 2 decades ahead of the US in ICBMs. Russia has a mixed fleet of lighter, solid-fuel, road-mobile ICBMs and heavier, liquid-fuel, silo-based ICBMs. Road mobile ICBMs like the RS-24 Yars are far more useful in the event of a nuclear deterrent, because their mobility makes them far more difficult to target than silo-based ICBMs. The Yars can carry up to 6 warheads. However, it’s payload is not just limited to nuclear warheads. It can also carry EMP warheads and precision-guided, conventional warheads, which are designed to replace tactical nuclear weapons for many applications.The SS-18 Satan is the backbone of Russia’s silo-based rocket forces. It’s liquid-fuel design allows it to be far larger and carry a far heavier payload than a solid-fuel rocket. As such, it can carry more warheads. While it is limited to carrying 10 nuclear warheads by treaty, it can carry up to 38 precision-guided, conventional warheads, enough to decimate any air or naval base, anywhere on the planet without going nuclear.Russia is also ahead of the US in unmanned underwater vehicle (UUV) technology. Vladimir Putin recently unveiled the Status 6 or Kanyon, a nuclear-powered UUV, capable of carrying a massive nuclear warhead, designed to incinerate coastal cities in the event of a nuclear war.Russia also recently unveiled the Burevestnik, a nuclear-powered cruise missile. The missile is believed to use a liquid flouride thorium reactor (LFTR), which has significant potential for civilian energy production applications. Although more difficult to engineer, LFTR reactors have less potential for a meltdown and could produce energy far more cheaply than conventional nuclear power. The Burevestnik is believed to have virtually unlimited range by virtue of its power plant.",0 followers,Luke Cillessen,1.6K,62,3.8M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-top-25-most-used-front-end-web-technologies

Since the beginning of time, the Russian does not like to venture far from home. This actually applies to all Slav nations.The USA like a true Anglo Saxon loves going far and wide, spreading their power far abroad creating “allies” in the same way the British, Dutch,French and Germans did at the ending of the 19th and start of the 20th centuries.For this the U.S. really does not need a very powerful defence system. After all, who is going to invade them? So research goes more into offensive weaponry.Now research, development and purchase of new systems. The US had reached the pinnacle of development for its role of spreading its world dominance. After all, no one the U.S. forces met on the field have anything near that of the Americans. Again there are no plans for fighting Russians. It's a big no no that can quickly reach nuclear.For this reason, majority of the US’s world largest military expenditure is for maintaining the massive military spread out across the world.Russia on the other hand still works to develop weapons to ensure that the west does not think of once again invading. After all, every time they let their guard down, they were invaded from the west.Russia uses a larger percentage of their military expenditure on research and development than the U.S.So here it is. This is not in any way superiorto this.A carrier is only needed by those armies that stray away from home. So the US had invested in them a lot. Russia has no need for them whatsoever,and would probably build any more only as a luxury. They can reach any country in the northern hemisphere from the thousands of airfields at home.So what do the Russians need? They need weaponry that would annihilate a carrier group if it is used against them. They invest and develop coastal defence and antiship missiles that overtime had become superior to anything the U.S. has. And are still working on better ones.TheThey had become masters in hypersonic antiship missiles.TheThis practice of countering faster advancing U.S. surface ships had allowed Russia to balance the playing field at a fraction of the cost. Even during the Soviet era.VA-111 ShkvalThe Russians had always favoured Submarines to a surface navy. They had produced over time some of the most deadly ballistic and attack submarines.The recent reincarnation are among the deadliest in the world.The most important feature of a good attack sub is to be undetectable as to sneak up on its prey. You can not get quieter than the new Kilo class subs, which has been nicknamed “black hole” by the westIt was reported that it successfully shadowed both British and American carriers on test runs. On an NATO attack on Syria, It prevented the British submarine sent into the area for the attack from firing its missiles. By shadowing it.Similarly when it comes to air supremacy, both produce incredible aircraft. We will not go into comparing them here. However, once again the U.S. has the numbers, while Russian has the ability of shooting them down cheaply if ever used against them.Russian air defence works in an interlinked network involving,Long to short range SAM systems like theMedium to short range like theAnd terminal phase interception likeThis allows Russia to provide airspace deniability with the ability to pick and choose what to shoot down with what. While protecting each other.In case of Nuclear deterrence, Russia keeps working to make sure any missile sheild used to try and disable its ability to retaliate and therefore upset MAD is ineffective. As a result, while the Western deterrence has been stagnant for years, Russian ICBMs are at least two generations ahead. TheThey had also developed other alternative delivery systems like theandRussia is certainly not backward on the ground forces department either. Again mastering missile technology. In addition to almost all its missile systems be it coastal and naval, having the capability to be used against ground targets, Russians have theVery effectively used in Georgia and Syria. This is just a snapshot. Having massive budget and massive numbers, does not mean you can match into any where. This is because some other are specializing in neutralizing you at the cheap.Russian combat vehicles and tanks can stand their own in any battle field. TheIs an interesting concept of various fighting vehicles with interchangeable parts.They also take a well tested concept and update it to be comparable to their more modern weapons. Like the T72 of which Russia has thousands still in bubble wraps, and making the T72M3s out of them.As for the smaller and infantry based weapons, well it depends on individual preferenceEdit:I will clarify those points and will not address them in the comments any more.You do not have to do a combat test to know a weapon works. It will work just as well on a test ground. None the less, Russia used its new weapon systems in Syria. From cruise missiles to the tank drones.Even their Electronic warfare weapons. Another field in the military industry that they outdone others. Like theTheWhat was cancelled was theSide note: Stealth in its present form was invented in the USSR in the 60s byTheRussia has thousands of brand new T72 in storage. They had decided to upgrade them to T72M3 which is much cheaper than building a new Tank. The T72M3 has the same features with the T90.In Russia, a term is used “near abroad” and signifies countries very near the Russian borders. That is where the Russian interest lies. Before listing countries trying to disprove me. Open an atlas. Sending military advisor does not constitute an intervention.As for theEdit 2:I will not close comments because people have the right to express themselves and I like debating with educated smart people.What had I said wrong? I said that the U.S. is not the best in all aspects of the military. What Taboo how dare I!!Please note that if you violate the BNBR policy with me,you will be lucky if I block you.

So far there are no reports of it being used in combat by Russia.AIM-120This 335 pound missile carries a 40 pound warhead out to about 90 miles maximum at maximum of Mach 4 speeds. It uses INS, GPS, 2-way data link, active terminal radar and home-on-jam functionality to hit its target. It’s had a roughly 50% success rate in combat use. Lighter, smarter and further reaching than the R-77.Anti-tank (helicopter)9K121 VikhrThis 100 pound missile carries a 22 pound tandem HEAT warhead out to 7.45 miles. It is laser beam riding and requires controlled manual guidance by the helicopter gunner to hit the target. Other guidance options do not exist.AGM-114 HellfireThis ~105 pound missile carries an 18 pound tandem HEAT warhead out to about 5 miles. The Arrowhead targeting turret system on the nose of an AH-64 can automatically track and designate targets with a laser without requiring manual command guidance. Or a fire and forget radar guided variant is available allowing fire against targets from behind cover and generally allows one AH-64 to use a mast mounted radar to find targets (with only the radar peaking above cover) and then another AH-64 to fire from somewhere else.Anti-tank (Shoulder Fired)FGM-148 JavelinThis shoulder fired missile system weight approximately 50 pounds and sends a 35 pound missile with a 19 pound warhead out to about 2.5 miles.
