Unless folk live on at least 1/4 acre of deeply self-sufficient solar edible-jungle with own water etc like we do, they couldn’t survive more than a few days WTSHTF, in typical 1-room apartment, in retirement village, or in concrete garden-free homes in Over-Crowded suburbs. Best home & land design formula, cheap room space savers, eco villages & sick homes, total radiation disaster - cheap quickies for home & business - tree-less envelope, floor filing cabinet - Kids & Students Education, Responsible kids, Bill Gates to kids - green & tech Bible quotes, Stress & anxiety, amazing Dalai Lama quote - Youngsters job bidding - Fashionomics showing non-stitch clothes with little cutting - making wines, jams, preserving fruit, champagne etc without yeast or sugar & no heat apart for some jams; making cold yoghurt; solar food dryers - commercialI forgot to mention that a huge motivation for being ecologist is being able to live virtually FREE, get everything for free, give big free grants & Do everything for free.

1,"Transfer learning in ML models.Humans are really good at generalizing. We only have to see a few dogs before we can recognize a dog when we see one.Machines are not. ML models require millions of examples before forming a reliable classifier, and that classifier is very specific to the data on which it was trained. If your training data doesn't include dogs with three legs, the model won't recognize them. A machine that plays Go is useless at checkers.Transfer learning is the ability to apply a model from one domain to a different one.

A machine that plays Go is useless at checkers.Transfer learning is the ability to apply a model from one domain to a different one. It's hypothesized that the reason humans learn so quickly is that we are fitting new examples into our existing knowledge rather than forming entirely new categories. If we could teach machines to do the same, they would learn exponentially faster and apply that learning more effectively.Transfer learning is a very hot topic in AI research right now, so I expect major breakthroughs in the next few years. I think this may be sufficient to achieve artificial general intelligence, but even if not, it will dramatically extend the range of tasks that machines can accomplish.","135,529 followers",Hector Quintanilla,582,1.2K,88.6M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Which-technology-will-be-the-next-big-thing-in-2019

Just like someone could have predicted that the smartphone would kill the dedicated media player and mobile camera (and many other things), we can look at the trends and get a pretty good guess.What will likely replace the smartphone will be wearable devices, with a combination of AR and voice AI taking center stage.

We’ll likely have some kind of hub and it will enable to us to use dumb screens anywhere. So you might carry around a device that is similar to a current smartphone but that has very little internal processing power at all, basically just enough to run the screen and the connection. This will enable you to do things that you can currently do on a smartphone but it will integrate with AR and VR.The simple answer is AR will replace the smartphone. We’re probably at least 5–10 years away from that really happening though.What technology will replace the Mobile Phone?",5 followers,Bill Otto,7.6K,7.5K,43.3M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Which-technology-will-be-the-next-big-thing-in-2019

She says it’s alright but she’s a bit concerned that at midnight every night it tells her to wait whilst it’s done uploading to the Chinese Embassy and it keeps asking if they can have a tour of RAF Menwith Hill. The manufacturers have told her it’s just teething troubles.Mind you it’s going to be a bit of a disaster for mobile thieves as all the ESPs will be Ninja-trained. They’ll not be picking these up off the table and legging it far before they find their heads shoved up their own arses whilst still on their necks.The Green Party are horrified by it as they think it’ll take too many solar panels and stupid windmills to provide the power we need for the ESPs. They’re right and Samsung and Apple are planning to build nuclear plants to cope with it. This’ll have the Green Party turning out en masse at these plants to protest and Samsung and Apple, I’m not saying you should, but if you were to arrange a little bit of a leak at just the right moment, if you know what I mean, I’m sure the rest of the world might thank you mightily for it; just sayin’ eh?I blame the EU.:P",UNKNOWN,Anonymous,1.8K,0,0,2021,https://www.quora.com/Which-technology-will-be-the-next-big-thing-in-2019
