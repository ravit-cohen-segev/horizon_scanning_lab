1,Can you phrase this clearer or provide more information? I am not aware of any communication issue that is specific to surgeons.,"1,136 followers",Rise Hatten,1.9K,2.6K,7.2M,2015,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-current-communication-issue-among-surgeons-today-and-why
2,"Oh, sure. We poke holes in stuff to see what comes out. If it’s blood, we can be pretty sure it’s an artery or vein. If it spurts, probably an artery. If bile comes out, we figure it’s either the gallbladder or the bile duct. Usually, the gallbladder is bigger and squishier.Of course, if what comes out is brownish and stinks, there’s a good chance it’s colon. Helps to distinguish, also, if you can feel hard stool in it. If it’s small intestine, usually what comes out is thinner, often greenish.Other things are harder to poke holes in: kidneys are pretty firm, and it depends on where you poke tOh, sure.

If it’s small intestine, usually what comes out is thinner, often greenish.Other things are harder to poke holes in: kidneys are pretty firm, and it depends on where you poke them. Blood could come out, but not as much as if it’s a blood vessel, but if you poke what’s called the renal pelvis, you can expect to see urine.So it’s a lot of poking, squeezing, wiping stuff up, smelling. Sometimes just feeling helps; like the liver, feels kinda firm and smooth, and it’s bigger than your hand. So if you feel something like that, and your hand is in the right upper part of the belly, it’s probably liver.When we can’t tell, we ask the circulating nurse to hold up pictures for us to compare to what we’re seeing.If none of that works, we try to remember what we were taught in medical school and several years of surgical training. In a pinch, that can be useful, too.",5 followers,Jitendra Mistry,1.3K,959,2.5M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-current-communication-issue-among-surgeons-today-and-why
3,"“My only son” she sobbed tears running down her face.I had met her about a year before when she came to the ER with her five year old kid who had been savagely bitten on the face by a neighborhood dog. He was young and crying. He was going to need a lot of work.The plastic surgeon on call was actually famous for a couple of things. Facial symmetry repairs and scarring. Everyone agreed he was the best for those issues. Everyone agreed he was the guy they would call if it was their child. He was also famous, or infamous, I’d say, for his attitude.It is well known but not stated often enough that“My only son” she sobbed tears running down her face.I had met her about a year before when she came to the ER with her five year old kid who had been savagely bitten on the face by a neighborhood dog.

Everyone agreed he was the best for those issues. Everyone agreed he was the guy they would call if it was their child. He was also famous, or infamous, I’d say, for his attitude.It is well known but not stated often enough that narcissism is the opposite of empathy. Hey, I’m the social worker and I know all about that and I’d seen the plastics guy in action a couple of times. Everyone was right. Great technician, no bedside manner. I don’t think the kid noticed. He was too scared for any of that. But mom did. She was smart enough to not debate the issue with the doctor about to suture her son’s face but she did bring it up with me. She didn’t like him. That’s a social work issue. Conflict, anger and disgust are always social work issues.I was a relatively new guy and although the ER docs knew what was up, none of them wanted to upset the delicate balance of on call surgeons so I may have been the perfect foil for a confrontation.Sticking my neck out a little I stated the obvious and validated the mother’s feelings.“You’re not the first person to say that.”“I hate that man”.“You’re not the first person to say that either.”“I don’t want him touching my son.”“Of course not. I wouldn’t either. But I’d try to put that aside and focus on the outcome. I promise he will do good work. But I wouldn’t want to enter him into a personality contest.”She offered a little laugh and took a minute to think about it.“That’s so hard.”“Everyone says that too.”“But you trust his work?”“We all do.”There was a little less steam coming out of her ears now.“OK. Let’s do it.”A year later she was back with her son for some simpler childhood illness and saw me in the hallway.“Bob. Oh Bob. Look at this face.”The little boy smiled up at me. Perfect symmetry and almost no scarring.“Looks good.”“Yes it does. I was so angry that night you know what I thought? I hope he fails. I hope he looks bad to all of you. I was so angry, I actually wished that on my son, my only son.”“And now?”“I’m glad he did well and that my son looks normal. But I wouldn’t want to enter that doctor into a personality contest.”We both laughed a little.Of course, that surgeon needed an intervention. Everyone knew that too.The next time I saw him it was really busy in the ER and he was fuming about not having a nurse to help him. I humbly offered my services and he accepted. When I looked interested in his procedures he started explaining what he was doing. Not empathetic. More like showing off. I asked a few more questions and he answered eagerly. I didn’t care if he was showing off. I just cared that he was appearing nice and the patient didn’t complain.When I saw him a few months later he asked if I would help him sew up a kid with a hand laceration. Same thing. He was the teacher and I was the student. Or so he thought.“Those parents were really scared. When you talked to them and explained things I think it really helped them with their fears.”“Hey. Who let a social worker in here with all these surgeons?”Before the steam started to come out of my ears he showed a brief smile.“Good to see a new face.”",91 followers,Ann Rogers Balfour,5.9K,176,973K,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-current-communication-issue-among-surgeons-today-and-why
4,Well we saw three light bulbs in your lower colon and wanted to know if I should tell your wife what this operation is really about. Should I sir? Do you recall how many light bulbs or other stuff you put up there? I mean you will be fine but we still have to do surgery because at least one light bulb is broken. Did you put drugs in those bulbs ?,"4,309 followers",Sheaffer Williams,3.9K,431,9.3M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-current-communication-issue-among-surgeons-today-and-why
