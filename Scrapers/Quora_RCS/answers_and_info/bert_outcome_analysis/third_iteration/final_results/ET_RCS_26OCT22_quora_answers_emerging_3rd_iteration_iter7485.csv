Bitcoin doesn't have a central government.With Bitcoin, miners use special software to solve math problems and are issued a certain number of bitcoins in exchange. This provides a smart way to issue the currency and also creates an incentive for more people to mine.Bitcoin mining is intentionally designed to be resource-intensive and difficult so that the number of blocks found each day by miners remains steady. Individual blocks must contain a proof of work to be considered valid. This proof of work is verified by other Bitcoin nodes each time they receive a block. Bitcoin uses the hash ash proof-of-work function. This both serves the purpose of disseminating new coins in a decentralized manner as well as motivating people to provide security for the system.Basically, it is easier mining bitcoins by being involved in pool mining or cloud mining. Cloud mining involves purchasing time on someone else’s rig,The Block RewardWhen a block is discovered, the discoverer may award themselves a certain number of bitcoins, which is agreed-upon by everyone in the network. Currently this bounty is 25 bitcoins; this value will halve every 210,000 blocks. Additionally, the miner is awarded the fees paid by users sending transactions. The fee is an incentive for the miner to include the transaction in their block. In the future, as the number of new bitcoins miners are allowed to create in each block dwindles, the fees will make up a much more important percentage of mining income.Mining blockMining pools and Cloud mining allow small miners to receive more frequent mining payouts.By joining with other miners in a group, a pool allows miners to find blocks. With cloud mining, you are sure to contributing to mining without having to buy hardware and pay w pensive electricity bills. Pool mining consisting of cooperative miners who agree to share block rewards in proportion to their contributed mining power.While pools are desirable to the average miner as they smooth out rewards and make them more predictable, they unfortunately concentrate to the mining pool’s owner.Mining ProfitabilityThe first bitcoin miners were able to earn coins relatively quickly just using what computing power they had in their homes. By 2019, cryptocurrency mining has become a little more complicated and involved. WithNo matter what you decide to mine, you have to account for your setup costs, including, in some cases, graphics cards that can cost upward of $700 apiece.6﻿ 7﻿ It’s possible to put together a basic rig for some of the less popular cryptocurrencies for around $3,000. However, some miners spend more than $10,000 on their rigs. On top of building your rig, you also need to realize that you are going to be using quite a lot of power. If you have high power rates, you could end up spending quite a lot to mine coins—especially bitcoin. The electricity cost involved in mining a single bitcoin is more than $3,000 in the cheapest states.The Long ViewInvesting in expensive equipment and spending in excess of $3,000 in energy bills to mine one bitcoin only makes sense if you believe the price of bitcoin will rise beyond the $3,000 to $4,000 range.

My marginal electricity cost is USD $0.1139 per kWh, so at the current (at the moment) bitcoin price of $380.99, I am making a profit of $3.99 per day. The reason I call it an educational hobby, however, is that the total return on the project since September, 2013, is -27.2 percent if I turned everything into dollars today. I keep the bitcoin I mine in bitcoin, because only an increase in the value of bitcoin could make the project profitable overall. My expenses so far are 72% equipment and 28% electricity, but of course that puts no value on the (large) amount of time I spent working on this. I've learned an amazing amount about bitcoin in the process, so I consider it a win either way.Update December 29, 2015: Bitcoin mining difficulty has increased significantly, the worldwide network is now making 786 quadrillion mining guesses per second. I am now mining 0.03299220 BTC per day, my marginal electricity cost has risen to USD $0.1152 per kWh, and at the current bitcoin price of USD $430.73, I am currently overpaying for the bitcoins I mine to the tune of USD $0.85 per day. My mine uses USD $455.56 worth of electricity to mine one bitcoin. On the other hand, the garage keeps the rest of the house warm in winter, so it's roughly a break-even operation for the time being. The overall operation would be -16.8 percent if I turned everything into dollars today, expenses so far are 70% equipment and 30% electricity. If bitcoin prices rise to USD $518 then I'm in the black.Update January 10, 2016: Rising bitcoin mining difficulty is taking its toll. Mining 0.02967912 BTC per day, but it costs USD $15.08 in electricity per day to operate the mine, so my effective BTC cost is USD $508.10. With the current market price of BTC at USD $440, it doesn't make sense to run much longer unless bitcoin prices rise. The whole project is -14.9% if I stopped right now and turned everything back into USD. The upside is that my hobby has returned 85.1% of its costs. Adding some pictures of the effort.Update June 11, 2016: Current mining operation is running at a loss, but whole project is now 11.6% in the black. Cost of electricity now $0.12 per kWh, mining 0.016 BTC per day but at an effective cost of $997 per BTC. Will run until the halving of the block reward next month, then take everything apart. Overall expenses so far 65% equipment, 35% electricity. Looks like my hobby paid for itself if I want it to, but so far I have not sold any of the bitcoin that I mined.Update October 25, 2016: My sons and I had a blast taking everything apart and recycling all of the metal, and I guess I never need to buy another fan. Whole project now 21.7% in the black with the rise in bitcoin prices.

You can make your research and if you find the platform deem fit then you can go ahead just like i did.Bitcoin MiningBitcoins are ‘mined’ into existence. Mining is what the world calls the process of bringing them into circulation. Bitcoin mining involves both verifying transactions on the Blockchain and releasing new bitcoins (as the reward for the verification).The process of mining involves an accumulation of recent transactions into blocks and trying to solve a cipher puzzle. The first participant to solve the puzzle gets to place the next block on the blockchain and claim his rewards. The mining reward which includes both transaction fees (paid to the miner through Bitcoins) and the newly released Bitcoin encourages competition in mining.Since bitcoin mining is decentralized, anyone with a proper connection to the internet along with powerful enough hardware can participate in mining.Block rewardsThe number of new Bitcoins that are released with each mined block is known as the ‘Block reward’. The block reward is halved every 2,10,000 blocks or approximately every four years. This way, the diminishing block reward results in a total number of bitcoins that is always less than 21 million. According to current Bitcoin protocol, 21 million is the cap and no more can be mined after that number has been reached. This cap of Bitcoin is expected to reach in about 100 years.Transaction FeesA few bitcoins are included in many transactions, as a reward for the miner who mines the block. These are called the transaction fees. These transaction fees are voluntary by the person who sends a transaction. Whether or not a transaction is to be included in a block, is also a voluntary decision taken by the miner. Thus, users who send transactions can also use transaction fees to incentivise miners to verify their transactions in priority.Mining DifficultyThe difficulty level of mining depends on the level of efforts being put into mining across the network. Following the protocol which has been laid out in the software, the Bitcoin network repeatedly adjusts the difficulty of the mining after every 2016 blocks or almost every two weeks. This is done with the aim of keeping the rate of block discovery constant. The higher the difficulty level, it becomes less profitable to mine for the miners. Hence, if more are people mining, it is lesser profitable to mine for each of the participants.Bitcoin mining ASIC — 2012Over the past half decade, mining has become extremely challenging — it is now futile to mine bitcoins using your computer or even your graphics card. Miners now need ASICs (Application Specific Integrated Circuits) — dedicated machines designed to mine bitcoins.Buying BitcoinsBitcoins can be bought either from exchanges directly from market places through other people. Like any other commodity, you can purchase bitcoins from anyone holding some themselves.You can get started with buying bitcoins in a variety of ways, ranging from credit and debit cards, wire transfers, physical, hard cash money and even with other crypto-currencies. This is entirely dependent on whom the Bitcoins are bought from and where they or the buyer lives. In fact, some countries even have bitcoin ATMs now.A bitcoin ATMExchanges and Online walletsThere are a variety of exchanges and wallets that are competing in the Bitcoin business.

It can also be produced cheaply with renewable energy, which is impossible for gold. In the not-so-far future, we will probably see 100% of BTC being mined with renewable energy.To answer the original question, I think the best metric for BTC’s fair price is related to the total hash power of the network.Right now, the Bitcoin network is entirely secured by ASIC chips (application specific integrated circuits) that can only perform one operation: mine BTC. What they give up in flexibility is more than compensated in the efficiency at which ASICs solve Bitcoin hashes. To do a 51% attack on the Bitcoin network (akin to a temporary DDoS attack), you would have to purchase specialized hardware. Right now, that would entail purchasing $10B of Antminer ASIC chips. I think the market capitalization of all BTC in circulation is proportional to the cost incurred for an attack (see chart below)Given the historical trend between hash rate and market cap, I’d say BTC looks like it’s right around it’s fair value (to my eyeball). But, in late April-May of 2020, the Bitcoin block reward will be cut in half. This usually produces strong incentives to develop more efficient ASICs, boosting the hash power of the network and pushing BTC to new highs.If there’s one indicator I’d recommend keeping an eye on, it’s the total Bitcoin hash power (which you can follow","1,613 followers",Carpenco Dima,1K,66,2.8M,2019,https://www.quora.com/How-can-I-join-a-genuine-Bitcoin-mining-company

The Bitcoin community itself doesn’t even know for sure who invented Bitcoin – I even met one of those who claims to be the big founder.But there are definitions of Bitcoin that even a five-year-old could understand. Bitcoin is an online form of money. So, when you read “cryptocurrency”, think digital gold. Think virtual money.From old to newWhen you send a dollar elsewhere online it is usually a bank that verifies the transaction – and takes a fee for its trouble. Your money is usually in the hands of age-old institutions, many of whom we now mistrust due to decades of corruption and profiteering.But bitcoins can be bought and sold without the need for those organisations. It does this by distributing what used to be our trust in one organisation across a system of many people. Trust is shared out. And here another metaphor borrowed from the physical world comes into play. We ensure that our digital transactions are true and secure by writing them onto a shared, public “ledger”. It’s a big, open, digital book of truth and openness.This ledger is secure and transparent. It isn’t owned by one corporation – it’s shared and kept up to date by the Bitcoin community. And no one charges you for recording your transactions into that ledger. Instead, those who verify the truthfulness and reliability of those transactions are the bitcoin miners. They all compete to verify the bitcoin transactions we all make, and those who succeed, are rewarded with bitcoins. In a way, it’s a game. A clever competition, with high stakes. And the winners not only win bitcoins but also help the whole thing to keep working reliably.A bit like gold, not all bitcoins have yet been discovered. You can buy and sell the ones that are “out there”. On average their value has been rising over the years. The ones yet to be discovered are prospected for by “mining”.When Bitcoin was founded, a finite limit on the number of bitcoins was set, just as there is a finite amount of gold in the physical world. The number was 21m. So far, more than 12m are in circulation. That means that a little fewer than 9m bitcoins are waiting to be discovered. So there are people buying and selling already existing bitcoins. There are people buying and selling goods and services with bitcoins – some of whom exchange them for stuff and money back in the physical world. And then there are people trying to find those increasingly elusive golden tickets – they are mining the undiscovered bitcoins.So how do you mine bitcoins?Anthony Volastro offers a clearer description than most: “‘Mining’ is lingo for the discovery of new bitcoins – just like finding gold. In reality, it’s simply the verification of bitcoin transactions.” And how is that done? “It’s not just one transaction individuals are trying to verify; it’s many. All the transactions are gathered into boxes with a virtual padlock on them – called ‘block chains’ … Miners run software to find the key that will open that padlock.” And when they achieve that, new bitcoins are released as a reward.They are tending the bitcoin garden, playing a kind of functional game – keeping the ledger true and the transactions verified. And it has all been set up so that, by doing that, you can find the unreleased bitcoins and dig them up.In the early days, it was easier to be a miner. There were fewer miners around. As the bitcoin universe has expanded, however, more people are after the finite digital gold, just as in real gold prospecting. People have banded together, created “pools”, sharing ever more expensive hardware, processing capability and even electricity costs that go with finding those precious bitcoin golden nuggets. You see, it isn’t easy to find a bitcoin. The easier days are over. The view on the street now is that “only the biggest centralized miners will profit.”So is it worth becoming a miner?To answer that question, it’s worth hearing from the practitioners – the digital diggers and drillers. “It took ages for me to mine bitcoins because of enormous competent people mining with excellent machines,” said one.Mining has become more competitive and tougher. On discussion boards the advice is not to even attempt it solo. You’ll have to join a “pool” – a group mining together, with some pretty impressive computer kit. (Most are all-night coders in China). You’ll need access to some hardcore hardware and be ready to burn 24/7 electricity.Some now claim that the hold just a few groups have now over the mining operation is a significant barrier to entry for anyone else, especially a rookie. There’s no going it alone. You’ll have to join a “mining pool” and you might just feel like you’ve ended up in another institution. Ironic, eh?There are alternatives to Bitcoin, such as Litecoin or Quarkcoin. Yet these alternative forms of digital money are becoming increasingly competitive as well. And as they evolve and become more competitively turbulent, the rewards diminish as well.. If you are just starting out as a potential miner, you stand a better chance going for one of these newer alternatives.So, unless you are ready to dive in with some serious hardware, investment of time and even real money, bitcoin mining is probably not for the little guy any more, if it ever truly was. Bitcoin is institutionalising around centralised groups and may well be becoming similar to the organisations the whole thing was set up to replace. But rather than mining to get Bitcoins, I advise that you invest with trusted cryptocurrency investment companies like Coinstarhaven (www.coinstarhaven,com).

So I never got my money back. (This was about 4 years ago).Since then I haven’t mined anything because it is just not profitable unless you mine a cheap coin before it becomes popular.People who want to get into mining often do so because they read online blogs from years ago detailing how many coins people were able to mine and they apply current prices and think that somehow they will be able to get rich from it.These are typically the kinds of people who have very little understanding of basic economics and how cryptocurrencies actually work.If one person tries to mine a currency, it is easy. If 1000 people try it, it quickly adjusts to become 1000 times more difficult. This only gets worse the more people pile in.Since September 2016 the difficulty has risen by 5.5x which means the ability for each person to mine bitcoins has dropped by roughly that much in just 12 months.DifficultySo if you can mine 1 bitcoin today then you are more than likely to be only receiving 0.18 of bitcoin in a year’s time and 0.018 of a bitcoin in the following year.Essentially people who buy mining gear are expecting the price to go up faster than the difficulty increases. That is because they don’t understand that the difficult actually follows the price and not the other way round.Therefore it is and has always been much more cost effective to simply spend that money buying the coins outright than to buy gear and pray that it somehow mines enough coins for you to turn a profit.This is no different from the logic of people who go into old gold fields looking for gold. They somehow think that they will be lucky when all of the gold has already been mined out. Sure, some people who try it do end up finding a small amount of undiscovered gold but if they simply went out and got a real job, they would earn far more money.
