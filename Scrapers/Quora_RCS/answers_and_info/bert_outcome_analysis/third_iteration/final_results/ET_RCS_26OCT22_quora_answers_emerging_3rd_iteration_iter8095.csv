This place all around us was created by and for one being: The Son.You, me, and everyone else are very sophisticated AIs. An AI is an artificial intelligence and compared to the only being who really exists, God, we are all artificial and made by design and for a purpose.When an AI decides to go rogue and do its own thing then the creator takes it out of the game in one way or another.Jesus Christ was and is The Son of God but not the entirety of the Son’s being. What I mean is that Jesus was the avatar used by The Son to enter into His own game. He was and is fully God and fully man.Jesus Himself had no power on His own to do miracles and wonders. That power came from the Holy Spirit. Jesus had to find out He was God over time. He wasn’t born knowing this but He left clues for Himself in the written Word so that He would, in time, find out who He was.So let me make this easy….imagine that there are two people in Heaven. One is a Dad who sits at a terminal. The other is a Son who sits at another terminal. They’re both playing a video game that the Son created and populated with His AI creations. These two sit in the REAL world. There’s no linear time there. (Actually, I’d tend to make the case that linear time is an illusion created by perceiving the passing of one moment to another.) The Dad and Son live where time doesn’t flow. They live in moments. New moments are created. None are ever destroyed. Both Dad and Son live simultaneously in every moment. Weird huh?Time here in this reality is an algorithm. I tend to think it’s like a time series with decay forecasting algorithm. Because decay is built into our reality. Anyway, the video game kind of goes sideways and the Son steps in to make some internal course corrections.But The Son never actually separates from the Dad and leaves where the Dad is. He kind of projects Himself into this world using His AI interface. That interface was Jesus and because He is derived from and connected to the Son He is God the Son.Imagine an aquarium. I stick my fingers into the water but leave the rest of my hand outside the water. Those fingers are still part of my hand. They’re just perceived as coming from out of nowhere from the point of view of the fish.Now as far as escaping the simulation you can and you can’t. If you’re a saved Christian then you are NOW seated in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus. Your spirit is not bound to this place but exists here and there. Your soul is bound and stuck to this place. This is the only existence it has ever known. Your spirit didn’t come from here. It came from out there.Well, where the Son and Dad dwell are lots and lots of “people”. They like the Sons game and He invites them to be a part of it. So they use AI avatars to interface with this world and play the game too.That’s all of us. We’re a unique creation. We have three parts to us and one of those parts is multidimensional and not of this world.The AI part (soul and body) can ignore the commands sent to it by the spirit part. We see this all the time….a person disobeys that little voice inside but the little voice can’t make the person do what it says.(All three parts of us are directed by an intelligence. My body has its desires, needs etc. My soul has its own as well. So does my Spirit. ) My mind can ignore what my body wants it to do. The Spirit part can ignore both the mind and body as well.Imagine playing an online game and you go to jump and your avatar turns towards you as you look into the screen and says, “I don’t want to jump and you can’t make me!”I hope someone got something out of this long winded explanation.","220,648 followers",Franklin Veaux,6.4K,47.3K,783.2M,2021,https://www.quora.com/If-the-Universe-is-a-simulation-can-we-escape-it-Matrix-style
1,"Yes. You can.Actually the way was defined around 2500 years agoIf you want to escape from this simulated universe (or multiverse) you have to understand theFirst thing you must understand is thaYes. You can.Actually the way was defined around 2500 years agoIf you want to escape from this simulated universe (or multiverse) you have to understand theFirst thing you must understand is that suffering happens, it is unavoidable and it happens to everyone.Birth is suffering, aging is suffering, illness is suffering, death is suffering, union with what is displeasing is suffering, separation from what is pleasing is suffering, not to get what one wants is suffering.Actually it is not suffering in the sense of something that only involves physical pain or mental pain it involves a wider range of the unsatisfactory nature of reality that we really never get what we want. Whatever is pleasant will inevitably pass so it can't be relied upon. Even pleasure is unsatisfactory in that sense.So that is the first noble truth and it boosts us on the path to the extent that we don't see. Unless we don't realize the nature of lived reality as unsatisfactory we are never really going to get on the path.2.The second noble truth is about the origin of suffering and where this comes from. The origin of suffering is this craving which leads to renewed existence, accompanied by delight and lust, seeking delight here and there. That is craving for sensual pleasures (pleasure of the eyes, norse, tung etc), craving for existence (don't want to die), craving for non existence (want to die, not want to live now), craving for extermination. These are the origin of suffering.How and why that could be the origin of suffering ? and answer that question it will take a lifetime (or many lives) to really understand that, you really need to see it from an experiential level. Meditation will help you to understand that.We are distracted by what's surrounding us because it's so new and different and interesting. We tend not to think about these things and so what we are doing is a constant series of diversionary tactics to keep us away from reality.3.The cessation of suffering is the remainder less fading away and cessation of that same craving, the giving up and relinquishing of it, freedom from it, non reliance on it. To escape we have to give up this craving we have.4.a. First understand unsatisfactory nature of realityb. Once we understand this we begin to try to abandon this craving we have. That happens through an intellectual understanding, when we’ve come face to face with unsatisfactory nature, and we begin to see on a wider level through meditative practice. After that we naturally begin to relax around this craving because we realize that is not to our own benefit.c. Realize the cessation of suffering. We have to try to get ourselves to a position where we can begin to realize that cessation of suffering.d. Finally you will realize the way to the cessation of suffering by totally giving up your craving, desire, attachment.This is where you will escape from this simulated universe (or multiverse).","21,775 followers",Glyn Williams,12.4K,9.1K,53.3M,2020,https://www.quora.com/If-the-Universe-is-a-simulation-can-we-escape-it-Matrix-style

TheIt is theoretically possible for us to figure out, on our own, that we are in a simulation if the simulation is not perfect.  For example, this paperThe other way we could know that we are in a simulation is if the super aliens decide to tell us somehow by injecting unexpected events into the simulation that violate the laws of physics of the simulation. For example, in every home on earth, a book could suddenly and simultaneously appear which tells the story of how this is a simulated universe run by some entities for some purpose. Alternatively, the simulators could instantaneously implant that knowledge about us being in a simulated universe into the brains of all humans. Or they could even have simulated a Jesus Christ (2000 simulation years ago) and simulated all the miracles he performed to see how the simulated humans would react. Basically all bets are off if we live in a simulated universe.The only way ""we"" could escape would be if the super alien simulators decided to create a real being in their real universe and then fill that newly created being in their universe with all of our memories - then ""we"" could live and interact with them in that universe, but I would hardly call that ""me"" and it certainly is not ""me"" escaping from this simulation.",82 followers,Jonathan Armstrong,9.2K,0,0,2013,https://www.quora.com/If-the-Universe-is-a-simulation-can-we-escape-it-Matrix-style

Maybe this is the universe. Maybe this plane of existence, this floating blue marble where we are born to breathe and die is all the verifiable universe that any of us will ever see…so perhaps the real question is whether or not it's possible to escape the matrix of this world…So if the world is in fact a simulation, then what are we? What is interesting is that the bible actually references the matrix, to open the matrix is to enter the world from the womb, which makes sense since the meaning of matrix is the point or place where something is created as a separate thing, like the fertilized egg becoming an embryo that becomes a human being within another human being, a separate entity that then opens the matrix into this world.Are we more than the body? More than chemical/electrical impulse..Is there something more than what exists between our first and our last breath? Are we really beings of spirit and light that enter a different dimension when this body is done? If this is just a simulation, what happens when you die? So many questions…and now, back to yours….I don't believe that we are meant to escape this place by any other means but death. There is a purpose in being here, a meaning to each unique and individual life that is lived on this plane of existence and whether it be a simulation, or a true reality.. this is where we are at and the important thing is what we do with it. It is a place where we must learn to overcome fear itself and to understand the ripple effect that our very existence has upon the lives of others whether it be positive, or negative. It's a journey through the undiscovered that lies within us all….and we.are shapes by the choices made at each crossroad. Trying to escape is like escaping from the choices that you yourself have made that has created whatever it is that you now wish to escape from. Perhaps a better ambition would be to change the world around you so you no longer wish to escape.Besides, where are you going to find a public phone these days?","220,648 followers",Franklin Veaux,1.8K,47.3K,783.2M,2021,https://www.quora.com/If-the-Universe-is-a-simulation-can-we-escape-it-Matrix-style

22,"Yes I think so.The more pertinent question is… why does anyone think we *would* colonise exoplanets?Afterall, it is not scientists who have been saying this, only science-fiction, and it would be odd to take something with the word fiction in its title as fact.And it is not like we have colonised the bottom of the ocean or the middle of the Sahara or a mile underground, despite them having been nearby for our entire existance.I think some people treat humans as like a bacteria, that just grows and grows blindly, filling all available space until it has consumed everything and dies.But our histYes I think so.The more pertinent question is… why does anyone think we *would* colonise exoplanets?Afterall, it is not scientists who have been saying this, only science-fiction, and it would be odd to take something with the word fiction in its title as fact.And it is not like we have colonised the bottom of the ocean or the middle of the Sahara or a mile underground, despite them having been nearby for our entire existance.I think some people treat humans as like a bacteria, that just grows and grows blindly, filling all available space until it has consumed everything and dies.But our history of colonisation does not follow this trend. We move to places where we can have a better life, not just because we found some space. A better life doesn’t just mean better food/water/space, it also has to include social factors, is it a place you want to raise kids? Can you still visit family from the new location? Will you have a stable and enjoyable job? is it safe?For this reason I don’t believe that we will colonise the moon or Mars, let alone somewhere that takes tens of thousands of years to reach.It is *possible* that someone decides to put a little manned base on the moon (stuck underground), but if they do, it will be for ego rather than practical reasons, and it won’t last. This does not count as colonisation anyway.",UNKNOWN,Ernest W. Adams,2.2K,44.2K,248.8M,2019,https://www.quora.com/If-the-Universe-is-a-simulation-can-we-escape-it-Matrix-style

24,"It’s a fact of life that science can only talk about what it knows. There are many obstacles to space travel. It seems very likely that few of these obstacles will be overcome in the foreseeable future.Radiation from space is still pretty much unknown. Radiation from our sun is a major potential danger, and we’re not sure we can defend against it in a practical manner. While traveling toward another star system, the ship must attain a great deal of speed, causing stationary particles, say hydrogen, to act somewhat like alpha particles.If a defense against these cannot be put in place, space trIt’s a fact of life that science can only talk about what it knows.

While traveling toward another star system, the ship must attain a great deal of speed, causing stationary particles, say hydrogen, to act somewhat like alpha particles.If a defense against these cannot be put in place, space travel is not possible.To achieve the speeds required, a great deal of energy is essential. We don’t have access to that now, and most ideas on how to get it are highly speculative.That is not to say that tomorrow some physics lab might have a breakthrough, and we can master space travel, and find ways to defend against radiation of different kinds. The way things are right now, neither of these breakthroughs seems to be on the horizon.But then, back around 1900, there was talk of shutting down the US Patent Office, since we had gotten to the end of discovery, and there was nothing left to discover.",26 followers,Balaji Viswanathan,743,5.6K,427.2M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Is-there-a-superhero-movie-worse-than-Green-Lantern-Ryan-Reynolds
