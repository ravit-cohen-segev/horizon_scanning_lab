1,"2030 is too soon for a Nuclear Electric Propulsion (NEP) system for interplanetay travel. The 2050s might be doable. Even then conventional chemical rockets such as Starships will be needed to hoist the components for a NEP spacecraft into orbit, where it will be assembled. Electric propulsion is not new, but there have been advancments such a VASMIR and the newer upgraded 3 in 1 X3 Hall Effect Ion Thrusters are now in the 8 newton trust range, which is nearly two pounds of thrust. This is about a thousand to 100,000 times more thrust than other traditional Ion thrusters.

Electric propulsion is not new, but there have been advancments such a VASMIR and the newer upgraded 3 in 1 X3 Hall Effect Ion Thrusters are now in the 8 newton trust range, which is nearly two pounds of thrust. This is about a thousand to 100,000 times more thrust than other traditional Ion thrusters. However even with a bank of 50 X3s, the resulting 100 pounds of thrust is useless for getting into orbit. Each X3 uses between 100 and 200 kw. By comparison, ISS solar collectors can generate about 120 kw. Not enough to run one single X3 at full power. This is why a fission nuclear reactor is needed. Figure about 90 megawatts, for a 200 metric ton spacecraft with a bank of 100 x3 Hall effect thrusters. A 90 megawatt fission reactor for space use is far bigger than anything ever done, but there are no show stoppers. Just a bunch of large radiative cooling needs and the long (like pulling teeth) 15 year licensing time frame, environmental impact statements and nuclear saftey certs. (Yeah, 15 years). Transit time to Mars ranges from 2 and a half months to 6 months (Earth and Mars at opposition for 6 months), and to hell with planet phasing, it does NOT “need” to be considered, and throw out Hohmann transferrs as well. This NEP ship uses a shorter, more direct Brachistochrone trajectory instead of a long circling Hohmann Transfer. Not only is the ship two to three times faster than a rocket for a Mars trip, but the crew is free to return to Earth at will, whenever they need to, which is a big plus. Of course the ship must carry a lander powered by conventional rockets in order to land peronnel on Mars. The NEP ship would orbit Mars, but could never land itself. The ship would spend about 10–12 days under constant acceleration, and nearly the same 10 days again, to decelerate so that Mars orbit can happen. The NEP ship takes ten days to reach 10 — 12 km per sec past hyperbolic excess escape velocity from Earth orbit. For comparison, the Starship does a little over 4 km per second from Earth orbit on its way to Mars. The Starship also has to travel a larger distance to reach Mars than the NEP ship with its Brachistochrone path.As far as a NEP ship being the most advanced technology from Earth, circa 2055, I would say its “up there"", but there may be other things just as impressive. Technologies come in categories. Such as micro electronics and computer technology, High energy physics (atom smashers, nuclear power plants, etc) Macro Mechanical machines (Large cranes, Mining machines, etc) It's hard to compare an optical quantum computer to the latest fusion power research projects, for instance. They are so different.","27,826 followers",Sophia-Helene Mees de Tricht,1.8K,8.1K,44.4M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Why-will-electric-engines-for-rockets-destined-for-Mars-be-the-most-advanced-technology-on-Earth-by-2030

8,"OK, let’s start with this: automationNow it’s a tiny fraction. The tractor, combine, and other forms of automation destroyed a huge number of jobs. Around 1975, there were vast numbers of factory jobs. Since then, manufacturing output has much more than doubled, but manufacturing employment has fallen off a cliff.Some jobs were lost to offshoring, but most were destroyed by automation (which is why production is still rising).So automation does destroy jobs. But whaOK, let’s start with this: automationNow it’s a tiny fraction. The tractor, combine, and other forms of automation destroyed a huge number of jobs. Around 1975, there were vast numbers of factory jobs. Since then, manufacturing output has much more than doubled, but manufacturing employment has fallen off a cliff.Some jobs were lost to offshoring, but most were destroyed by automation (which is why production is still rising).So automation does destroy jobs. But what about all the new jobs it creates? There are some, of course, but not many. How many jobs do you think were created producing, selling, and servicing tractors, combines, etc? Eighty percent of all US jobs, to replace the farming jobs they have destroyed? How many jobs do you think were created producing, selling, and servicing robots and other factory automation technology since 1975? As many as the 8 million they destroyed? Not even close, which makes sense if you think about it. If automation created as many jobs as it destroyed, it wouldn’t save business money, so they wouldn’t do it.OK, so if automation destroys more jobs than it produces, then why is unemployment at multi-decade lows? Clearly lots of new jobsBut if new jobs are created, who cares whether they’re created by automation or not? The distinction is important because if the companies were able to use automation to produce the extra stuff they want to sell, then the new jobs wouldn’t be created. Automation doesn’t create jobs, it creates demand; if the demand can be filled without creating jobs, that’s what will happen.There’s a second problem. Often people whose jobs are destroyed never find another job. Younger people come along to take the new jobs created, because the new jobs require skills the people who lost their jobs don’t have. So while unemployment is at multi-decade lows, part of that is because after a certain number of weeks of unemployment, people are no longer counted as unemployed, but that doesn’t mean they have work. In fact, the proportion of Americans over 16 who are employed is also at multi-decade lows.So the new work that needs to be done may be done by robots, and even if it’s done by humans, it may need skills that the people who’ve lost their jobs don’t have, and may never be able to acquire. We could have strong demand for workers and still many people who can’t find jobs.Furthermore, there’s an ongoing shift in the kind of automation that’s going on. Up until a decade ago, most of the work that was automated was just repetitive physical tasks. Now Artificial Intelligence technology is starting to be deployed, allowing more sophisticated tasks to be automated. We already have financial reports and sports stories being written by computers, and computers are able to do legal discovery much faster and more reliably than paralegals, andComputers are going to continue to advance, increasingly taking over tasks that require intelligence and judgement, and people are not getting any more powerful. If this trend continues, and there’s no indication that it will not, increasing numbers of people will be incapable of learning skills that make them competitive with computers.So why am I advancing such an anti-automation idea? I’m not. Far from it: this is excellent news. Would you like to be a farm laborer, cutting grain all day with a scythe? I sure wouldn’t. I’m delighted those jobs were automated: I get to eat grain without having to cut it myself. I get to have fancy gadgets like the one I’m typing this on without having to work in a factory. Automation is an awesome thing.There’s just one catch. Kind of obvious, really. If automation replaces most jobs, then how will we live? The companies will have robots building all this wonderful stuff, as much stuff as we could want, but only company owners will be able to buy it. Right now our economy works because businesses need to hire workers to produce their goods and services, and pay those workers, who spend that money to buy the stuff the companies produce. Without workers, the companies earn all the money, and don’t spend it, so the money stops circulating.When this starts actually happening, you can expect to see workers earning a decreasing share of the national income, with businesses retaining more. In fact, that’s well under way already. In the early 1960s, workers took home more than 67% of national income. By 1997 it had fallen below 62%; in 2001 it had recovered to 65%, but since then it has fallen to 59%. The trend is downward and accelerating.So the problem is not automation. Companies can produce an abundance of everything we want, and more automation means more ability to produce. The problem is that our economy cannot distribute that production without people working to earn their share. We’re going to need to think of another way to distribute that production. Right now the best we have to turn to is our social welfare system, which doesn’t do very well and doesn’t look likely to scale to ongoing mass unemployment.
