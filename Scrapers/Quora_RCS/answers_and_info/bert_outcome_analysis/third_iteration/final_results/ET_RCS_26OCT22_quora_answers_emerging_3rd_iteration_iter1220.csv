Almost all of this influx of capital is a result of the surging spot price of Bitcoin. The rise of overnight multimillionaires led a booming interest in the asset class as an investment, and clever teams were able to monetize that interest in the form of ICOs (Initial Coin Offerings) that enticed further investment and hype.Despite this surge in money and interest, we have yet to see any major blockchain products enter the market. Most major ICOs have been failures or outright scams. And a significant portion of the distributed computing and cryptography community (whose technology and mathematics power blockchain tech) see most ICO tokens as a modern take on Dutch Tulip charlatanism.There are a number of reasons why blockchains have failed to deliver on the promises of the cryptocurrency community. But from a technology perspective, the answer is the simple: they can’t.Long before Satoshi wrote his white paper for Bitcoin, a cryptographer named Robert Merkle created a data structure called a Merkle Tree.Merkle is one of the earliest modern cryptographers. As an undergrad his work in secure communication led to the creation of Public Key Cryptography. Merkle has spent most of his career designing secure computing systems, and in the late 70’s this led to his creation of the Merkle Tree.A Merkle Tree is an abstract representation of data that uses cryptographic hashes (i.e.: miniaturized representations of data that have a mostly 1:1 relationship with their source) to help navigate and verify the membership and position of nodes in a structure. Like branches in a tree securely storing a register of leaves coming off them, a Merkle Tree allows programs to efficiently search a structure of data and certify that data’s position and configuration.Just like Merkle’s creation of “Merkle’s Puzzles” kicked off a revolution in Public Key Cryptography, Merkle’s new Merkle Tree ignited a boom in the field of Secure Distributed Computing (or SDC). This has become one of the hottest research areas of computing over the last 40 years, and most modern operating systems and file systems benefit from Merkle Trees and other research within SDC.One major beneficiary of SDC is Bitcoin. In the original implementation of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto used a separate hash-based system to structure their block chain. This led to serious security vulnerabilities, and a modification of the Bitcoin source led to the integration of Merkle Trees in Bitcoin to help address these issues.Since then, Bitcoin’s use of Merkle Trees has been emulated across most other cryptocurrences. From Ethereum (and it’s vagary of ICO forks) to Litecoin, seemingly all popular blockchains rely on BTC’s Merkle Tree architecture.Unfortunately it sucks.Bitcoin relies on an authentication process to ensure that a block can be added onto its chain and it’s Merkle Tree is updated. This process is known as mining. Like real mining, Satoshi designed BTC’s mining function (known as Proof of Work or PoW) to integrate commodity scarcity and incite competition in the hopes of hosting the network across a globally distributed network.PoW forces participants to struggle against an endlessly increasing difficulty to search for a hash to complete a transaction. While academically fascinating, the structure and design of Proof of Work is exceptionally flawed. Part of this is in some bad assumptions in how participants compete. But another big problem is in its implementation which is the result of shoehorning PoW into a Merkle Tree structure.Most blockchains have copied Bitcoin because Bitcoin was the first and most profitable/popular coin. But few have thought to address Bitcoin’s designs and use of Merkle Trees, owing to the technical complexity necessary to understand the subject matter and the depth of integration within BTC’s deep source.Or they’re just lazy and don’t want to spend time learning how any of this works because they’re just here to write an ICO white paper to run the crypto currency equivalent of a boiler room operation. But hey do you.Anyway, the result of all of this is that Ethereum looks like Bitcoin but with a different set of assumptions around mining. Litecoin looks like Bitcoin but with some extra features and tweaks to how mining works. Because many of these popular blockchains use the same “chassis” borrowed from Bitcoin, they all share some of the same architectural traits - and many of the same weaknesses as Bitcoin in weak computational performance and questionable security.But Bitcoin is just one take on SDC. What has the rest of the non-cryptocurrency world been working on / using instead for secure distributed computing?Meet Raft:Raft is an evolution of the Paxos algorithm that focuses on secure consensus. Consensus is a set of problems focused on verifying the correct result of a set of decisions and doing so in a probably secure and fast manner.If you’re into Bitcoin or cryptocurrencies this may sound familiar. It’s the exact same problem that algorithms like Proof of Work and Proof of Stake are trying to solve, and superficially Raft sounds a lot like an idealized Proof of ___.Though some implementations of Raft also use Merkle Trees, Raft takes a fundamentally different approach to driving consensus. Most blockchains drive consensus through majority. But Raft has nodes in its network automatically elect a leader that certifies transactions and distributes workloads to improve speed and efficiency.This makes Raft much more computationally efficient than most blockchain consensus algorithms that rely on Bitcoin’s style of architecture. It also makes Raft systems theoretically much more secure, as it intimates that you create a distributed system for authenticating nodes.Unfortunately this architecture spooks out a lot of cryptocurrency folks because of its seemingly centralized nature. Or bluntly because the word “leader” appears most blockchain enthusiast with no/minimal background in distributed computing talk (very loudly) about how it is dangerous because it isn’t “distributed.”But that contention doesn’t make sense. Raft leaders are chosenRaft proposes a fundamentally superior approach to most styles of consensus employed by Bitcoin-style blockchains. Projects like Tendermint have noticed this and started to embrace the protocol in their own mining protocols. Freed from the legacy constraints and baggage of BTC and PoW however, these solutions end up deviating so heavily from Bitcoin’s architecture that the end result is arguably no longer a blockchain.We are at a very early stage in Secure Distributed Computing. If SDC was the operating system industry, most blockchains are like 70’s-era CP/M DOS. While Raft itself is a significant improvement, it itself is just a mile marker on the beginning of a long race.There will always be a space that blockchain-esque systems. But they likely will look very different from the architecture of Bitcoin, just like Windows 10 today looks very different from its MS-DOS distant ancestor (which itself is an iteration on CP/M).Similar to how GUIs and the mouse transformed how we think about/use operating systems, something is going to transform this space. And it likely won’t be a blockchain - or at least a blockchain how we describe it today.","135,499 followers",Hector Quintanilla,582,1.2K,88.5M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-next-gen-IRCTC-based-on-What-are-the-technologies-used-to-build-the-next-gen

7,"Historically and statistically, there is a major telecom technology upgrade only every ~10 years. Since 4G is just a novice technology (atleast on field), we expect it to completely dominate for next 7-8 years atleast. So, for the commercialization of next gen. technology (in pure terminological sense – 5G), there is quite some time. Currently, it is topic of research and standardization with lot of open questions. So, it would be hard to comment/commit on any technical findings. Nevertheless, there are lot of credible links online which can give you a good overview about what might come.StatHistorically and statistically, there is a major telecom technology upgrade only every ~10 years.

If we break down the broader topics, there are plethora of small and detailed topics that are and would be looked into. However, in my humble opinion the most dominant would be security related topics. Decreased energy consumption and virtual zero latency would also be dominating the discussion but only second to security.P.S. The above is only my understanding and a minuscule part of what is actually going on. It should not be considered complete and definitely not 100% correct. However, it would be a good starting point and should give you a good overview of technical terms to google and dig more information yourself.

But they would have an abundance of material on Earth, especially of carbon, which would likely be the building blocks of such an assemblers. If you were carrying a jar of them and tripped and they spilled out, and they had no limit, they would quickly devour the entire earth with no way of stopping them.But here is where things get interesting: These tiny robots would have the ability to construct molecules from atoms, giving them the ability to produce amazing materials like graphene, cubes of apple, and even brain material.With advanced nanotechnology in the form of self-replicators, the entire world would experience a revolution. Think for a second about what wouldn’t change in the face of machines that can produceProduction jobs would cease. The price of every item ever created would be lowered massively. Supercomputers and experiments regarding brain material would become almost commonplace. Terraforming other planets would take years if not months.
