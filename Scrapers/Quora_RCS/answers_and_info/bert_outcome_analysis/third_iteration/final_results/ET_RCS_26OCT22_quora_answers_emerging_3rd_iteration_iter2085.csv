3,"Well, you might get a lot of answers for this question, where people will be just blurting out specs of the smartphones from Redmi, Apple, Google, Samsung and Oneplus. But believe me, all those are cliched 5.5″ Snapdragon 835, 625 powered 4 gigs RAM devices. The real phone whom we can give credit as one of the founding fathers of ‘Mobile Phone’ for masses is the Nokia 3310. I will mention down some specifications, unlike all these so called Smart Phones.Well, you might get a lot of answers for this question, where people will be just blurting out specs of the smartphones from Redmi, Apple, Google, Samsung and Oneplus.

4,"No - the tiny size and battery power of a cellphone wouldn’t be enough to talk to a satellite that’s orbiting hundreds of miles above you. (That’s not the only reason - but it’s an important one.)Instead they use a grid of cell-towers - spaced one to two miles apart (typically) - although they’re often packed together more closely in places where there are a lot of people with cellphones - and spread further apart on very flat ground where there aren’t many people.With distances of just a few miles - there is enough power in your phone to reach the nearest tower. Also, because each tower onlyNo - the tiny size and battery power of a cellphone wouldn’t be enough to talk to a satellite that’s orbiting hundreds of miles above you.

Also, because each tower only has to communicate with cellphones within a few miles of it - each tower doesn’t get overwhelmed by the number of calls being routed through it.The area around each tower is called a “Cell” - which is why we call them cell-phones.Cell towers are sometimes literally on their own special towers…the vertical white cylinders in the picture below are the radio antennae that communicate with your phone:Sometimes they put them onto existing radio and TV towers to save money. On this one, the cellular antennae are in rectangular boxes instead of cylinders - but it’s still easy to spot themSometimes they are disguised as trees - so as to not upset the view of the local landscape:I find this cell tower hilarious:The one on the left is “under construction”. When finished they look like the ones on the right!Here is one disguised as a palm tree:The ones on this fake palm tree have been painted green to blend in a bit better - but they are the exact same vertical antenna design.On this one, they seem to be painted brown…but you can still spot them quite easily!With the new 5G cellphones - the towers are packed incredibly closely - perhaps just one per city block or even one on every large building in a busy city…so you can see them attached to all sorts of places:But you can usually spot them because of those exact same white vertical cylinders.The idea is that the towers are laid out (roughly) into hexagons like this:Each hexagon is a “grid cell” - and the system decides which tower you’re going to be using based on which one gets the strongest radio signal. If you’re moving (like in a car) - the phone will sometimes jump to the next tower as you get further away from the last one.One of several reasons why using a cellphone from an airplane is such a terrible idea is that at the speed of a typical passenger airliner - maybe 600mph - your cellphone has to switch towers every couple of seconds - which makes it difficult for the cellular network to keep up with the continual tower switching.",21 followers,Jeff Nelson,1K,1.6K,23M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-is-eSIM-technology-used-in-Meizu-zero-an-upcoming-mobile-phone-and-how-it-works
5,"Have you ever seen a personal computer from the 1970s? Here’s the Commodore PET from 1977. It came with 8K of RAM, and a tape deck for storage.The IBM Personal Computer in 1981 didn’t replace the PET with a wholly different thing. But it did make improvements, and of course, as an independent development, no compatibility between them. But that’s the default. New things replace old, they don’t cooperate with old.The Macintosh in 1984 also didn’t toss out the idea of the personal computer, but it made improvements.So did the Amiga computer.Laptop computers didn’t change the whole idea, either.Have you ever seen a personal computer from the 1970s?

They did come up with a name for the class of personal computer: “laptop” or, later on, “notebook.” But they were still personal computers.And 42 years later, we still have laptops, which are still personal computers.Along the way, we added another new subclass, the tablet. They’re still personal computers, but there has been a revolution along the way, even if it happened a bit at a time.Sometimes we took a branch off to make something new, but still kind of the same thing. Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs) were very low performance personal computers. We didn’t want to say “PC” most of the time with these. Except Microsoft, who initially called them “Pocket PC”, because, yes, they were pocket personal computers. Still faster and more capable than that old PET 2001.Today we have these things. They’re still personal computers as well, but they also got another subclass name: smartphone. Why? Well, they are personal computers with several data radio modems, one of which uses the same kind of cellular networks that cellphones used, back when plain old cellphones were a thing.One of the reasons you know a thing is a personal computer is that it can adapt to nearly any purpose, given time. Compared to that PET 2001, your phone — I have an Honor Magic4 Pro phone here in my hand — isn’t the same thing at all. And yet, yes it is. I can chose the programs I want to run on it, I can personalize it, and it’s mine, not something owned by my company, my university, etc. It’s vastly more powerful than the PET, the IBM PC, the Macintosh, the Grid, the Amiga, etc. And yes, it can be used as a telephone (though in fact, being a European model in the USA, not so much), but that’s kind of a side effect of having a data network. In fact, in about a week, the voice networks on my cellular carrier, T-Mobile, go away forever. It’s all computer from here on, all data!I will make the claim that the Personal Computer represented a major change in the way computers are used, marking the smart of the second generation. And that smartphones did as well, being part of the third generation. Those generations were about access and portability, though, not the fact that you’re using a computer:Of course, these are just my distinctions. None of this happened all at once, but over time. The first members of a new generation weren’t terribly useful yet. I could have a typical PDA with me all the time, but it didn’t network. Networking was a completely different technological revolution that overlays all of personal computing today.So whatever comes next, it’ll probably start out kind of crappy, and it’ll be made from the personal computers we use today, but if it’s a true revolution, it’ll drive that evolution to new places. The one I have in mind is this:In short, it’s a revolution not in wide-area communications, not in computing power, not in mobility, but more than anything, a revolution in man-machine communications. That’s happened before, and in fact, continuously. The GUIs in Amiga, Macintosh, and Windows were a huge change. The GUIs in mobile devices, especially tablets and smartphones, were a predictable but important change as well, a compromise in efficiency necessary to enable mobility. Along the way we got other interfaces, like good speech recognition between machine and man.The ultimate end is to eliminate the interface, or at least as much of the interface as possible, and connect machine to our brains. I don’t know if we’re jacking in, entering enhanced AR/VR, sticking anIn fact, if we’re going the VR/AR way next, that’s already a thing. In fact, I work out in a VR app calledRead More","58,988 followers",Michael Wolfe,504,2K,17.3M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-is-eSIM-technology-used-in-Meizu-zero-an-upcoming-mobile-phone-and-how-it-works
