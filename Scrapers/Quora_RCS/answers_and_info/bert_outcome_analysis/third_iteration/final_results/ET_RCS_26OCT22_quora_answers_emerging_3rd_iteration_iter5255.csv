1,"EVs require electrical energy to recharge. They also require it to be delivered at a sufficient rate for it to be practical: while people charging from home are probably okay with leaving their cars to charge overnight, public chargers should be able to get an EV mostly charged up in minutes, not hours (with the exception perhaps of chargers installed in workplaces, malls, or any other place wereEVs require electrical energy to recharge. They also require it to be delivered at a sufficient rate for it to be practical: while people charging from home are probably okay with leaving their cars to charge overnight, public chargers should be able to get an EV mostly charged up in minutes, not hours (with the exception perhaps of chargers installed in workplaces, malls, or any other place were people usually spend time already).So a public EV charger needs to do two basic things: provide electricity that EVs can use, and do so quickly. Any future public charging infrastructure will need to meet these requirements. Quite frankly, I don’t see much wiggle room for the technology to change much, at least fundamentally.Sure, technological advancement w...",3 followers,Steve Baker,1.4K,27.4K,163.3M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Can-Blockchain-Technology-replace-Chartered-Accountants

3,What a silly question! It’s like asking if believing in a refrigerator or a computer would replace a belief in a god. Technology is not something requiring some sort of belief.

4,"Pretty stupid, actually, because this doesn’t even make any sense.Technology is not prescriptive. It is not something that you *believe in* like that.What is the purpose of human life?All moral questions are predicated on one’s answer to that question.Technology does not attempt to answer that question. Indeed, technology does not try to do anything. Technology is something that we use.Any supposed belief in technology is just going to be a religious belief that pretends to be something else.","115,126 followers",Daveed Phoenix,2.4K,9.9K,160.6M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Will-the-EV-charging-stations-be-replaced-by-another-technology-soon-after
5,"Human nature being as it is, people would find reason to disagree, argue, fight and even war over any number of real or imagined differences in technology, in pretty much the same way that they do with religion.Go on laugh. Preposterous you’ll say. What’s there to argue about?But after you have given it some thought, you’ll know it to be true.Betamax v VHS. Apple v Android?

The rooftop of the brick houses looks too polished as well.Here are some shots of a city, well these are from an urban simulation game:If a game engine can achieve such Photorealism then it is not a crime to expect some better graphics from the VFX of a movie that has spend crores of rupees for it.Then comes the worst part, the flood scenes at the climax of the film. Check out some of the stills from those scenes:The water simulation can be easily be distinguished as VFX, very cheap CGI …. Looks aside, when the river water approaches the city, the shots look extremely unrealistic, the wave looks like Tsunami, but mind you, here its a river, the Indus river which is causing the flood as the dam gets destroyed, but look at the height of the approaching waves, all these makes the scene unbelievable….Another problem was that the budget of the film was ₹100 crores, out of which, ₹60 crores were paid to the lead actor (Hrithik Roshan) alone… so the filmmakers had to create the rest of the movie in the remaining budget…Thank you for reading",47 followers,Skotti Alexis Kimble,1K,146,335K,2020,https://www.quora.com/How-would-the-world-look-like-if-a-belief-in-technology-replaces-a-believe-in-gods-religion

Rather than heralding actors’ obsolescence, new technology such as motion capture has been the catalyst for significantly improving the realism in both human and animal animations.It all requires an actor to build the expression and movement libraries.If we want to “replace” actors then what will likely be needed is software that knows how a human will move (and smoothly), can capture the minute entails of the face (again, smoothly). And we’re asking the software to do all that without a stocked library of human movements.That kind of artificial intelligence, however, is a long way away.The day when this can be done without an actual actor is a long way away. It may never come, or by the time it does the entity that will replace the actor has civil rights.
