0,"I follow an online video lock expert called lockpickinglawyer. He posts all kinds of content on key locks, including home deadbolts, padlocks, and some car keys. Although the keys haven't changed very much in appearance, over the last 5 to 10 years the locks have gotten harder to pick, and easier to re-key without requiring a locksmith. With the right tool and a little skill your front door can be defeated in less than 30 seconds. But it's an improvement from the previous locks, which took about 5 seconds to defeat, and almost any teenager could do it.",20 followers,Erin Patton,12K,1.5K,19M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Keys-look-the-same-as-they-did-several-decades-ago-Is-key-technology-evolving
1,"If intelligent life evolved on a water world, could it conceivably develop technology we could detect?An essential part of tool-making development is the mastery of fire. It is hard to imagine how a water-dwelling creature could control fire. By the way, our planet has a couple of intelligent water-dwelling creatures—and I can’t imagine how the presence of dolphins, octopus, and whales could ever be detected from light years away.","44,122 followers",Josh Fechter,39K,591,17.7M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Keys-look-the-same-as-they-did-several-decades-ago-Is-key-technology-evolving
2,"All technology is traceable back to fire. Without fire, you cannot smelt metals. Without fire, you can’t even make pottery. Without fire there would be no technology. Without technology, the species is not likely to evolve real intelligence.So, it doesn’t seem that it would be likely for a species to develop technology on a water world.","3,931 followers",Anumeha Sharma,37.3K,0,0,2020,https://www.quora.com/If-intelligent-life-evolved-on-a-water-world-could-it-conceivably-develop-technology-we-could-detect
3,"I see another danger. Algorithms have assumptions about people, built in of them. Like: when you like this, you want to see more. Or: when you google for a disease, you will have this disease yourself. Algorithms will be used in an increasing rate to determine what things you get access to. Everybody that is not covered by the assumption will be denied access. In the end only those that act according to the assumptions will survive. That means the people that have predictable behavior.

In the end only those that act according to the assumptions will survive. That means the people that have predictable behavior. This is data-/tech-evolutionary survival. In the end the question will be whether predictability will be an evolutionary trait in a biological way. In nature monocultures (lack of diversity) often collapse suddenly.For example: 1) When you want to know the distance between Rome and Berlin, the app assumes you are in Rome (or Berlin), why else would you want to know? 2) I have no mobile phone. However, many registering procedures require a mobile phone number. 2a) When I tried to order last week, some webshops refused me as a customer. 2b) When I had to go to hospital I could not get an appointment, In a streak of technological advancement the appointment is automatically routed to your mobile number. So I never got the appointment. When you call, staff doesn’t know what to do. You can only get an appointment by mobile phone. 2c) Likewise there are plans to use mobile phones as the only ‘ticket’ to rock concerts or for getting care at home. People without a mobile phone don’t exist anymore in their computer systems. When they designed them, they assumed everyone had one (often even silently assumed to be a smartphone too).",4 followers,Matthew Bates,1.1K,9.8K,293.1M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Keys-look-the-same-as-they-did-several-decades-ago-Is-key-technology-evolving
4,"Of course.The more technology becomes a way of living. The less we physically do, the more technology takes over.There will come a time when people will think driving a car yourself is ridiculous.

5,"As technology evolves do you believe we humans will become lazy and self reliant on technology?Technological advancement has already made humans lazy. Time-saving and labour-saving devices have, on the one hand, save time and labour of the busy people of modern times. On the other, they are not only making humans lazy but bulky and buxom also. Technological advancement is welcome up to a certain point. If we start depending on contraptions for our every need, we tend to go away from nature and thus self-invite diseases.Just look at the old people adorning every household.

Time-saving and labour-saving devices have, on the one hand, save time and labour of the busy people of modern times. On the other, they are not only making humans lazy but bulky and buxom also. Technological advancement is welcome up to a certain point. If we start depending on contraptions for our every need, we tend to go away from nature and thus self-invite diseases.Just look at the old people adorning every household. In the absence of variety of equipment in every nook and corner of the house, they were forced to do all the chores by themselves. The physical exercise they derived in the household work (kitchen, cattleshed, lands) was incomparably superior to the gym-exercise. Even at the age of 90, they look so healthy and active, youngsters should hang their head in shame.Laziness and rotundity are two sides of the same coin. One feels pity for our youth. They are not only lazy but suffering from over-sized body also. Just observe that the housemaid who works in 3 - 4 houses will be lean and fatless because, for the sake of her belly she is forced to toil hard and shed her extra flab. If one does house-cleaning, stone washing of clothes, utensil cleaning, gardening etc., fat shudders to come near that person. Junk and unwholesome food add to the misery.Further, for even small distances, our youth utilise two or four wheelers. Walking becomes a luxury for them. Further, sedentary jobs curtail physical activity.Laziness and bulkiness, its bosom pal, bring all sorts of new and unheard of diseases and much of their earnings go towards medical bill.Not only youth, even middle aged people feel uneasy owing to over-weight. The villains of the piece are - sudden and unexpected richness, over eating (because they have excess money to splurge), lack of physical activity and gym activity etc. One should understand that there is no substitute for hard work.If one has a little less intelligence, it is manageable. But, if one is lazy and bulky, life becomes insufferable .It is quite understandable that the present day youth, who have busy schedule, cannot be expected to do household chores in order to be fit. However, they can be prim and trim by consuming simple and wholesome and traditional food and doing some simple stretch exercises at home itself.","220,621 followers",Franklin Veaux,1.8K,47.3K,782.9M,2018,https://www.quora.com/If-intelligent-life-evolved-on-a-water-world-could-it-conceivably-develop-technology-we-could-detect
6,"Look at the technology around you. !00 years ago, automobiles were exemplified by the Ford Model T. In countries such as the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada, the horse and carriage was the primary mode of short-distance personal transportation until about 1915. Telephones were not common and long-distance calling was just arriving; it was a BIG DEAL. Aircraft were almost entirely biplanes or triplanes with cloth covering. We were still a year from the first clear voice radio transmission (1919).

We were going through the Spanish flu and medicine of the time could not treat it. All computers were mechanical. In short, technology has evolved enormously - beyond the imagination of inhabitants of 1918.Do you think people have grown lazy or reliant on technology in the last 100 years? We see new technologies, we adapt to them, and we move on.
