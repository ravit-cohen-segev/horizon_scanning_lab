6,"Interest in AI, work in AI has been around since about the 1950s. The most exciting idea and the goal of most of the earlier work has been General AI - AI that does pretty much what people do.

The most exciting idea and the goal of most of the earlier work has been General AI - AI that does pretty much what people do. A lot of the early decades of work actually tried to model how the human brain works - or, actually, trying to model various theories people had about how the brain worked. There was a lot of interesting thinking and work done in these areas by many people - including Marvin Minsky (a real nice guy, as well as a smart guy), Seymour Papert, and many others. But we didn’t really get much done with those ideas - probably ideas not practical and correct enough, not enough computing power.In the 1970s, ‘80s, ‘90s, rule-based AI - programs written by human domain experts to try and create specialized programs, and sometime fairly sophisticated high-end hardware, for particular problem domains, made some real progress. But for highly specialized, particular problems - like chess. But rule-based AI didn’t really make any progress toward the ultimately desirable General AI.Also around 1980, we started to see work being done in neural networks - webs of moderately simple and quite living-thing-like software “neurons” - software elements that can take multiple inputs, and when they get enough “activation” on their inputs, will “fire” - give an output. The seminal text, that assembled and organized key work up to that point and really introduced and popularized the technique of neural networks, was “PDP (Parallel Distributed Processing)” by David Rumelhart and James McClelland. (I was one of the editors.)A very key element in productive use of neural networks has been, rather than a human or even a program trying to give weights to the connections, the development of data-based training methods. The combination of training methods and greatly increased computational resources largely thru the availability of easily fabricated multiprocessor GPUs (based, in part, on my proposal of VLIW - Very Long Instruction Word processor architecture in 1979 and 1980), and in the past 10 or so years increased computational resources and vastly larger availability of training data sets have given much greater results. The development of Deep Learning - hierarchical ways to group and layer neural networks to address different abstraction layers of tasks, has also made a critical contribution.Modern AIs are not usually trying to be General AI’s. They are trying to produce useful, human-oriented results. There is little interest in the relationship between how they work and how a human works. We are appreciating and using the results we are getting. Those results are far more widely integrated into the daily conduct of your life than you realize. Think about how much you use your smartphone. Then think about how much you take it for granted. AI is already in about that situation in your life, but more hidden as a component of actions, not visible as a device you hold in your hand. Day by day, the presence and pervasiveness of AI increases. (This is different than the Pervasive Computing model that I proposed in the 1990s. Think of IoT as a week interpretation of that Pervasive.) In 5 or so years, modes of interaction, activities, and tasks that fundamentally incorporate AI will be as common and normal in your life as your smartphone is now.","284,845 followers",James Altucher,991,878,91.7M,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-next-big-thing-in-travel-technology

The obvious result of this is that it could lead to large numbers of highly trained people without work, which is clearly a serious problem.I am less concerned with the idea of a sufficiently powerful AI deciding to take over the world. Human volition, including the desire for power, is inextricable from being embodied entities with biological drives that have evolved over billions of years. We certainly don't come close to understanding the nature of our own consciousness, and even if someone was foolish enough to attempt to program human urges into an AI, they would almost certainly get it wrong: Even if they got it right, the basic motivational drives such as sex, hunger and survival, not to mention pride and the desire for status, would make no sense to a machine with no stomach or genitals.","45,622 followers",David Seidman,790,3.6K,85.1M,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-next-big-thing-in-travel-technology

But we are still far away from creating this:But your question is interesting, why does AI get so much press, so to speak. I think part of it is because as a topic, it is easy enough for most people to understand. At the same time, without hands-on or deeper knowledge of the tools and techniques it is so easy for a lay person to get out of control in dreaming of what someday could be possible. Try at a cocktail party to talk to someone about sensor fusion and how Kalman filtering facilitated us getting to the moon and you will find yourself alone pretty quickly. On the other hand, throw some words such as artificial intelligence, data mining, deep learning, virtual reality and everyone becomes a futurist, predicting how before we know it computers will become human-smart, will do our thinking for us and how we are almost there because they saw a robot that gave instructions to people at an airport.It also doesn’t help that the plot of just about any sci-fi movie depends either entirely or at least partially on some version of machines becoming smart and taking over the house, city or world. Alternatively, if the machines don’t take over, somehow an intelligent android or other service robot that is smarter than most people alive today, just happens to be a normal possession in every home (or was developed by a single genius scientist in their workshop). To say nothing of the tired old “I have no emotion until my creator added an ‘emotion chip’ and now I’m angry”.Over 30 years ago, AI was the big thing - computers would be able to reason and become so smart they would think for us. In reality, we got a paper-clip that nobody could use and lately Siri.

Snake oil products have evolved over the ages, slithering their way into modern technology.The tech industry today is full of software snake oil. It takes many forms, from vapourware and futureware to over-egged promises of functionality. But the crown jewel of tech snake oil? Apparently, it’s AI.Hype and ignoranceSo, why are so many companies selling AI snake oil?The first reason is that they are cashing in on the hype. Start-ups with an ‘AI’ classification attract as much as 15 – 50% more funding. Investors are eager to catch the AI train early, as the term grows more and more into a buzzword.Another reason may simply be due to consumer assumption. Many of the AI snake oil companies in the survey aren’t classifying themselves as AI – others are. They aren’t explicitly promising AI, people are adding that label themselves. The companies may even be ignorant of this classification. In this sense, they aren’t selling AI snake oil, but their customers are buying it.And finally, there’s a miscommunication or misunderstanding of what AI is. Artificial intelligence is so overused as a label that it’s losing its meaning. As a result, non-AI applications are inadvertently presented as AI.

It’s the snake oil of the tech industry in the 21st century.But for all the AI snake oil out there, real artificial intelligence is on the up. It’s not all lies, misdirection and vapourware.

We are also familiar with 8K HDTV where millions of tiny LED are flashed on an off to produce fantastically crisp colour images and video.Now imagine technology built on the same scale that spray different propellant across an array of nozzles that produce fantastically detailed patterns of forces across a surface that weighs every little yet controlled in very much the same ay as an HDTV screen.Micro Electro Mechanical Systems (MEMS) based rocket engines that create propulsive skins with 1000 to 1 thrust to weight. Improved thrust to weight derives from the fact that propulsive force from a rocket scales with the area of the rocket whilst the weight of a rocket scales with the volume. So, by reducing the size of a rocket thrust goes up faster than weight. Further, explosive energy scales with the volume as well whilst strength scales with area. So, by reducing the size of a rocket, reliablity goes up for a given weight as well.These propulsive skins have far fewer failure modes and are easily flown 100,000 times before being replaced. Further, they do not fail even after tens of millions of firings. This makes them competitive with jet airplanes in terms of reusability and reliabilty and safety.So we end up with surfaces similar to HDTV screens where there are millions of very tiny rocket engines each of which is highly reliable, but in the event of a single engine failing the bulk of the surface continues to operate. Just as an HDTV screen creates moving colour images, the propulsive skin array creates moving vectors across the surface to provide precise and reliable control.http://cap.ee.ic.ac.uk/~pdm97/powermems/2005/pdfs/153_Epstein.pdfhttps://mtlsites.mit.edu/annual_reports/2002/mems/rocket_engines.pdfAn array of 1/10th inch diameter nozzle operating at 150x atmospheric pressure in tiny combustion chambers each with a 1/100th inch diameter throat produces 2.2 pounds of force (9.81 Newtons (1 kgf)) of thrust with 5.176 grains/second (335.4 milligrams/sec) of hydrogen and 28.470 grains/second (1844.6 milligrams/sec) of oxygen.A square inch of this propulsive array produces 265 pounds of thrust (1135 Newtons (115 kgf)) and weighs around 4 ounces (114 grams).A liquid hydrogen/liquid oxygen rocket maintains a 10,100 mph (16,200 kph (4.5 km/sec)) exhaust speed at sea level and produces 265 pounds per square inch (1.62 MN/m2) of propulsive area.Just as each dot in a HDTV screen has one of three primary colours each thrust element in the propulsive skin has three primary directions and a resultant engine whose thrust can vary between 0.1 pounds to 2.5 pounds with 2.2 pounds being nominal. Three of the engines are at right angles to one another. The fourth is pointed along the diagonal of the box edges made by the other three. The diagonal is pointed normal to the surface. By varying the thrust in each thrust element the resultant thrust at that point is made to vary over a range of directions described by a cone with a 45 degree opening angle from each point, giving a high degree of control across the surface without gimbals, vanes or other moving surfaces.A propulsive skin consisting of millions of tiny rocket engines as described form a band around the edge of an aerospike nozzle. Such nozzles work well at all altitudes.An aerospike nozzle attached to the base of a 29.5 foot (9 meter) diameter ship is shaped very much like a Space Shuttle external tank only slightly larger.

The aerospike shaped tail section has a ring of propulsive skin. The band is wide enough to propel the entire system at lift off with a thrust of 1.8 gee.

It’s not really clear how fusion power would translate to controllable thrust. Maybe that will work out in time…maybe not.I hope we can have controlled nuclear fusion in the future, at least for electrical generation on the ground but it has proved elusive and always 20–30 years away.

Even the quite low thrust of an array of nuclear-powered Hall thrusters could radically shorten a manned mission to Mars and make the moons of the outer planets do-able!Note that a very small set of Hall thrusters would be required for ISS “station keeping”, so it’s almost a “No Brainer” even if the nuclear phobia demanded solar power!I could easily imagine a Spacex Starship being mated to a “Superheavy” booster in orbit where the SuperHeavy has some number of its 30 chemical engines replaced with arrays of Hall thrusters and some of its fuel capacity replaced with a full blown 50MW (or smaller) fission reactor! (Let’s look closely at the “SuperHeavy” when it rolls out! Could it be stacked to allow one conventional SuperHeavy to orbit a second SuperHeavy possibly without its onboard fuel and oxydizer but with a nuclear reactor, electrical power production system, and cooling fins!). It’s using today’s technology but it would get the job done!","68,769 followers",Kanthaswamy Balasubramaniam,898,17.3K,413.3M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-next-big-thing-in-travel-technology
19,"Better Engines in GeneralThere are engine improvements that improve the thrust equation in some way, by accelerating the escape gas to a higher velocity by having a chemical reaction with more energy. There has been attempts of a nuclear powered rocket that provides that energy. In general, a better engine usually means it is a lighter engine with equivalent power, or an improvement to increase exhaust speed.SpaceX ImprovementsSpaceX has beenBetter Engines in GeneralThere are engine improvements that improve the thrust equation in some way, by accelerating the escape gas to a higher velocity by having a chemical reaction with more energy.
