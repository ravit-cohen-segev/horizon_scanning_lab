0,"As an Amazon employee that sees a lot of resumes let me tell you why yours will end up in the trash and you will never get a chance to prove yourself to me. The interview process at these large companies is heavily biased toward weeding out potential good candidates on accident, just to make sure we never end up with a bad hire. One red flag alone COULD be looked over by someone reviewing your resume as long as you have a lot of other good points. The second red flag, I stop reading and dump the resume in the trash. My time is too valuable to waste on a bad resume.

The interview process at these large companies is heavily biased toward weeding out potential good candidates on accident, just to make sure we never end up with a bad hire. One red flag alone COULD be looked over by someone reviewing your resume as long as you have a lot of other good points. The second red flag, I stop reading and dump the resume in the trash. My time is too valuable to waste on a bad resume. Let's start from the top:Part-time programmer' - What do you do with the other part of your time? I don't want to work with someone that doesn't even care enough about this industry to do it full time. This is also a red flag that you could be the person that always comes in late and leaves early and always seems to be behind on their work. This is not a good impression to leave.Ok, I am done tearing your resume apart and I apologize if anything I said above hurts your feelings. But, I want you to understand why you won't get a job at Google, Amazon, Facebook, <insert top tier company here> as your resume sits.If you really want to work at one of these companies you should do a couple things. First, change your resume so the major red flags I pointed out above are a little less obvious. If you need help with this, there are lots of online resources for writing quality resumes. Second, you should consider getting a job with a real software company. Doing Freelance work can be rewarding if that is what you want to do for the rest of your life, but you want to work for a big software company so why are you doing it? Go get some relevant job experience to make up for the lack of formal education. This will do wonders for getting your resume out of the trash bin and into the consider pile. As it stands, the only way you will ever get an in-person interview again is to impress another recruiter at a coding competition.I really do wish you the best of luck in getting that dream job you are after. But like most dreams, they don't come for free so work hard and you will get there eventually.",74 followers,Christopher Franklin,4.6K,0,0,2015,https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-make-the-most-out-of-my-incoming-software-engineering-internship-at-an-investment-bank-to-get-into-top-technology-companies-like-Facebook-and-Google-Ive-been-asked-to-select-role-preferences-for-my
1,"Even though software engineering has often been stereotyped as an “antisocial” profession, it turns out that communication and teamwork are super super critical to being a good software engineer. Equally important is maintaining a positive attitude and taking criticisms professionally and not personally. With these attributes, you’ll always be learning and getting better at your job. Hopefully these tips will help you get that oh-so coveted Facebook return offer.

3,"First of all, you should apply for internships at Google and Facebook, if that's where you want to work. Investment Banks are usually credential heavy—so if you got an interview at an investment bank, you ought to be able to get one at Google.Ok so that's not really answering your question. My #1 suggestion is you want a manager at the investment bank who is interested in helping you grow as an engineer. If you can talk about how much you grew at this internship, and turn it into technical ability, the fact that you could do that matters more than a specific field.There's one caveat to that: sFirst of all, you should apply for internships at Google and Facebook, if that's where you want to work.

So suppose you want to be a Google engineer working on Android operating system. You might want a job on the banks device sdk team (if might have one of those).Google and Facebook work on big web technologies used at scale by millions of users. Investment banks have high performance systems that perform millions of operations as quickly as possible. There's a lot of overlap there.

5,"As someone who’s worked in very small startups and large tech companies (Facebook, Uber) I don’t think that’s a fair characterization. There are definitely specialists in small startups, and engineers can be pigeonholed in larger organizations and work on projects/technologies they don’t like.In large companies though, engineers have more latitude to figure out what it is they want to do and drive their careers or assignments so they are more aligned with their individual goals.","24,619 followers",Terry Lambert,743,23.1K,77.2M,2019,https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-make-the-most-out-of-my-incoming-software-engineering-internship-at-an-investment-bank-to-get-into-top-technology-companies-like-Facebook-and-Google-Ive-been-asked-to-select-role-preferences-for-my

If you are depending on the house always increasing in value, well, like any investment, you could lose.The underlying question is “Will the economy and housing tank in 2020?”. Obviously no one can tell you with a reasonable degree of certainty what will happen. However, if you look at various bellwethers you can decide to risk or not.Will the housing market collapse in 2020? It depends largely on location. Where do people want to live? For example, I would not be buying real estate in Kansas. I would consider buying it in Boston. Of course, you can get more house in Kansas than in Boston for the same money, but who cares if the house remains static or worthless in a year or two? Where will any downturn be less felt? Where will the subsequent upturn have the most impact? Location remains the most important thing about property. “It is almost always better to buy a bad house in a good neighborhood than a great house in a bad neighborhood.” So you have to consider where you are going to invest.Here, in Boston, Steve Wynn put up a gigantic casino in the toxic-waste shit hole of Everett. Before the plans became known, you could barely give a house away in this town. Now, property values have skyrocketed to ridiculous levels. Will it last? I doubt is, since the casino is failing after being open for less than a year. Meanwhile, poor white trash that owned broken down industrial or slum tenement property near Kendall Square are seeing their doghouses suddenly becoming worth a million dollars. Why? Because biotech has selected that area as their world-wide headquarters. This will probably remain for some time. If you even could buy a house here it would retain its value even in a downturn.Since this is an election year, the incumbent government will be opening up all the money taps to keep the economy from collapsing. Right now, the US economy is like a punchy fighter in the last round - powerful and dangerous but dizzy and staggering. Only massive deficit spending and ridiculously low interest rates has kept the economy up this long. I imagine the government will go to enormous lengths to desperately keep the economy moving until the election. From this point of view, the risk of house buying in 2020 is low. The bigger question is concerns what happens in 2021. That is when the house of cards will be more likely to collapse - and we are in a house of cards.Right now, for as long as you can risk it, the stock market it still a good bet because interest rates are low and not going up - they will only go lower. When interest rates go low, money flows to the stock market. The question is, how long will this last and if the stock market goes down, will it collapse or go down in an orderly way? No one can time the stock market or predict its volatility if it does collapse, or how long it will take to recover.I suspect the market will hold up for 2020 because of electioneering shenanigans. But having some money in cash is never a bad thing.",UNKNOWN,Mary,735,257,19.3M,2020,https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-make-the-most-out-of-my-incoming-software-engineering-internship-at-an-investment-bank-to-get-into-top-technology-companies-like-Facebook-and-Google-Ive-been-asked-to-select-role-preferences-for-my
