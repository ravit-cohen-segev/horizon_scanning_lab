This can lead to errors which are difficult to debug..NET- .NET offers excellent support for object-oriented programming concepts, making it easy to develop complex applications. - The .NET framework includes a wide range of features and libraries, giving developers access to a wealth of functionality. - .NET applications are compiled before they are executed, meaning that they are more reliable than interpreted languages such as PHP. - .NET applications can be easily hosted on Windows servers without the need for additional configuration Cons:- The .NET framework can be complex and difficult to learn, particularly for businesses with limited resources or expertise in web development- .NET applications can only be run on Windows servers, meaning that businesses would need to invest in additional hardware if they wish to host their website or application on a Linux server Java Java is a versatile and powerful programming language that enables developers to create robust web applications and services. Java code can be run on any platform that supports the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), making it easy to deploy applications across multiple environments Pros:- Java code is portable across platforms, making it easy to deploy applications on any system that supports the JVM- Java offers excellent support for object-oriented programming concepts, making it easy Ruby Ruby is a versatile scripting language that enables developers to create sophisticated web applications quickly and easily. Ruby on Rails is an extremely popular web application framework written in Ruby Pros:- Ruby is concise and readable, making code easier to write and maintain - Using Ruby on Rails can drastically reduce development time by providing ready-made solutions for common tasks Cons:- Since Ruby interpreter needs Internet Information Services (IIS) installed first , deploying Ruby applications can be complicated Which technology you ultimately choose will depend on your specific needs and requirements",75 followers,Alex Jansen,5.3K,0,0,2021,https://www.quora.com/Tracing-the-development-of-science-and-technology-from-pre-colonial-times-up-to-the-present-what-have-you-observed

I’m not sure whether newly-graduated EITs and grizzled PEs routinely know this stuff, but my impression is they often don’t. Rehabilitating failed, worn-out, obsolete underground pipes without digging is a really essential and still developing civil engineering practive. It is no secret that the US underground infrastructure is a mess, and the mess is getting bigger all the time, especially since deficit-dummies at every level have cut funding for repairs and maintenance. Nobody likes a backhoe digging up their street, so restoring water and sewer lines without doing that is. The range of materials and techniques now available is a testament to how many ways clever humans can solve a problem when the reward is a patent. Note: I don’t sell this stuff or promote any systems or contractors, so the reference that follows is just in case anybody is interested in consensus standards that cover this in a non-commercial way: ASTM Committee F17.67. There are really too many neat ways to do this to try to cover in this forum, but you all know how to Google.","227,246 followers",Gopalkrishna Vishwanath,726,11.9K,117.9M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Java-is-so-behind-technologically-why-do-so-many-people-still-want-to-be-Java-developers
6,"The short answer is no.Someday we may, in theory, approach a limit to our knowledge of physics, biology and other sciences (should we ever reach such an advanced level of civilization). I don’t know if we will, but let’s assume such a point exists.All of our technology depends on knowledge of science, but isn’t limited by it. It’s limited only by how we apply that knowledge. Advances have resulted by simply doing more with the basics we’ve known for quite a while. Many new technologies came about only because of advances in other technologies; they didn’t depend on fundamental breakthroughs inThe short answer is no.Someday we may, in theory, approach a limit to our knowledge of physics, biology and other sciences (should we ever reach such an advanced level of civilization).

Advances have resulted by simply doing more with the basics we’ve known for quite a while. Many new technologies came about only because of advances in other technologies; they didn’t depend on fundamental breakthroughs in things like theoretical physics.For example, recent developments in artificial intelligence are due to the existence of large amounts of data and more powerful computers, which resulted from the growth of the internet and incremental progress in computing hardware. The basic software techniques existed a few decades ago.The advance of technology has always been an uneven and unpredictable process, steadily building upon its ever changing self. Humans have always been very ingenious and inventive, so I don’t see us ever running into a limit.","5,361 followers",Valerio Cietto,677,2.4K,9.1M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Tracing-the-development-of-science-and-technology-from-pre-colonial-times-up-to-the-present-what-have-you-observed

The Middle Kingdom considered itself the middle of the universe and the emperor considered himself the middle of the middle!He therefore lacked interest in outside trade because he felt the kingdom already had all the resources and technology it needed to satisfy his wildest imaginations.ConcubinesAnd like the emperor, we should ask ourselves…To reflect on this question, sit on Daddy’s lap, and let me tell you a story about a Chinese farmer and a Western businessman…The Fisherman and The BusinessmanA businessman took a short vacation to a small Chinese coastal village. Unable to sleep he walked the pier. A small boat with just one fisherman had docked and inside the boat were several large tuna.“Only a little while”“Why don’t you stay out longer and catch more fish?”“I have enough to support my family and give a few to friends,”“But …. What do you do with the rest of your time?”The fisherman looked up and smiled,The businessman laughedThe fisherman asked“15- 20 years, 25 tops”“But what then?”The businessman laughed and said“Millions? Then what?”The businessman replied,Where this anecdote can be misleading is it presumes theBut what if the businessman continued by saying,The fisherman must then eitherThis would make the anecdote more historically accurate.Because if the Chinese fisherman was a metaphor forThis is also true for today.If a country or corporation becomes too satisfied then they’ll eventually be conquered by the competition.But what if there was no competition?If there wasn’t a West then Imperial China would likely still exist. Keep in mind a Chinese person of 1400 A.D. lived a remarkably similar life to a person of 1800 A.D and so it’s conceivable to believe that without the West a Chinese person of 1800 A.D. would live a similar life to a person of 2200 A.D.And life was better for the Chinese when they were stuck in theIn businessIn governmentLet’s go forward in time…I believe the pace of change will eventually slow down as global power continues to centralize into fewer and fewer hands.Eventually the global elite will come together under the premise,Now hopefully this decision will be made by some sort of coalition of democratic nations.Because if it doesn’t happen through democratic consensus then it will happen by dictatorial decree.“Artificial intelligence is the future, not only for Russia but for all humankind, whoever becomes the leader in this sphere will become the ruler of the world.” — Vladimir PutinBecause left unabated the race for better A.I. will eventually lead to someone getting the upper-hand and so, for example, the Chinese could unlock an artificial intelligence so powerful it gives them control over all the global satellites and therefore the globe.And then they would build a metaphorical great wall around any further technological development that could threaten their power, and then who knows, the world could slowly devolve back into something that looks a little like Imperial China.And as long as there aren’t any alien forces lurking upon the horizon, technology could stay stopped for a long, long time because the only people who could tear down the wall would be the people guarding it.I hope this answer gives you a greater sense of purpose because we can control how the wall is built. Why should we even build a wall around technology?
