2,"Supercomputers that are no longer state of the art continue to get used as long as it makes sense to do so. Now that supercomputers are actually large collections of computing modules, they might get separated into smaller pieces. Once the supercomputer or its pieces reach the point where ordinary desktop systems or servers (or a modest collection of them) catch up with them in computing power, the power bill to run the supercomputer can no longer be justified and it is scrapped.A few supercomputers find their way into museums, though the upcoming generation of massive exascale systems will neSupercomputers that are no longer state of the art continue to get used as long as it makes sense to do so. Now that supercomputers are actually large collections of computing modules, they might get separated into smaller pieces. Once the supercomputer or its pieces reach the point where ordinary desktop systems or servers (or a modest collection of them) catch up with them in computing power, the power bill to run the supercomputer can no longer be justified and it is scrapped.A few supercomputers find their way into museums, though the upcoming generation of massive exascale systems will never reach a museum as a complete system because they’re much too large. The most recently announced one, Frontier, is being built by AMD and Cray for Oak Ridge National Laboratory; it will cover about two basketball courts worth of space.To put that in perspective, the smartphone in your pocket is a much more powerful computer than a Cray-1, introduced in 1975 as the first supercomputer. The Cray-1 weighed 5.5 tons. A Galaxy S10 weighs 5.5 ounces. The Cray CPU consumed 115 kilowatts of electricity, and that number was likely doubled once the storage and cooling system was added in. The battery in the S10 has a total capacity of about 12.5 watt hours and that’s enough to run the phone for a day; the peak power consumption is probably under 10 watts. The Cray had 8 megabytes of RAM; the Galaxy has 8 gigabytes. The Cray CPU ran at 80 MHz; the Galaxy has 8 CPU cores that each run at speeds of about 2 GHz. All in all, the Cray-1 might make a nice piece of lobby seating in 2019 (it was built as a round kiosk and had seats around the perimeter), but actually trying to use it as a computer would be ludicrous.A picture of the Cray-1:",489 followers,Bengt Persson,1K,5.6K,1.4M,2019,https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-make-my-own-Super-Computer

4,"They get re-sold on the second hand market. My computer, for example, is a 20 core workstation converted from a compute node from a cluster that was dumped on eBay by a big internet company (rumours say it’s Facebook - I have no idea if it’s true or not) decommissioning a bunch of their compute nodes at the same time, and pushing the price of those parts down to peanuts - for example, we had 8 core SandyBridge EP Xeons going for $30 to $50, back when it was only 2–3 generations old, and Intel hasn’t been doing much between the past few generations.When I got it, it came in a 1U rack-mounted caThey get re-sold on the second hand market.

The black things on the right are fans. They are tiny, and they spin really really fast to cool the 2 Xeons CPUs with tiny heatsinks. The only reason those CPUs don’t overheat despite such tiny heatsinks is there is an incredible amount of airflow over them. That’s why the fans sound like jet engines.The SuperMicro motherboard uses a proprietary form factor, and only has a VGA output. PCI-E slots are available if you plug in an expansion card (so the video card would be mounted on an expansion card that’s plugged into the motherboard). That’s how they can fit something like a video card in a case that thin. The video card would be parallel to the motherboard, not perpendicular like they usually are on consumer motherboards.So I had to design and use a laser cutter to build my own case out of acrylic, after finding new (and bigger) heatsinks for the CPUs.This is what I ended up with:Why go through all this trouble? I got a dual Xeon (2x8 cores then, 2x10 cores now) workstation with 64GB of memory for A LOT cheaper than what they normally cost. Was it worth it? That depends on how much I value my time spent getting it to work… but that’s part of the fun.I am typing this answer on that computer (though it has been upgraded to water cooling).More details.",8 followers,Thomas Schuetz,883,1.1K,1.9M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-happens-to-outdated-supercomputers
5,"It depends.In all cases - we wiped and destroyed hard disk drives of machines that had been used for classified computations. After elaborate wiping procedures the drives were packed up, and escorted to a facility where they were melted down.Clusters like Blue, White, Purple were disassembled and taken back by the vendor ( IBM ).A couple of the Cray machines were sent to museums.When our CDC 7600 was to be decommissioned, the deputy director of the program brought a bunch of tools to our 0900 daily meeting.

I still have a few circuit boards and two LCM ( large core memory ) modules.A couple of the women took apart their LCM modules and had the woven grids of tiny magnetic beads made into earrings.One physicist had a section of chassis complete with Freon cooling lines converted into a wine cabinet.I also have some magnets salvaged from an old Amdahl storage system. Each magnet exerts over 200 pounds of pull. Fun to crush cans with by placing can between the pair and letting go. But usually just keep the pair together and use them to wipe old floppy disks and credit cards.","359,013 followers",Sean Kernan,9.1K,5.6K,727.2M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-happens-to-outdated-supercomputers
6,"Outdated supercomputers either go to museums or scrap.The operational and power costs of running a supercomputer are only justified when incurring such costs produces the extraordinary results expected of such a specialized machine. Once the supercomputer is eclipsed by an ordinary computer or by a significantly faster supercomputer, the obsolete, specialized device literally has no use.For example, consider the fate of the IBM Roadrunner, the world’s fastest computer in 2009, justifiably scrapped in 2013 in consideration of the support costs relative to newer machines.Outdated supercomputers either go to museums or scrap.The operational and power costs of running a supercomputer are only justified when incurring such costs produces the extraordinary results expected of such a specialized machine.

7,"I worked as a Solution Architect with NVIDIA 2008 - 2018, in the Tesla compute group, helping design and upgrade supercomputers for scientific computing, oil exploration, and deep, learning.Each supercomputer node consists of a chassis containing a motherboard, power supplies, network cards, hard drives, and the CPUs and GPUs that do the computing. These nodes are stacked into racks, which are lined up in rows of cabinets to make up a supercomputer when all the nodes are networked.Most components are designed to be replaceable, from the CPUs, to the GPUs, to the nodes themselves.

As better CPUs and GPUs become available, they replace the old ones in the existing nodes, and the supercomputer gets faster and has more capability.These used components are often resold or donated to academia.When new CPUs and GPUs have new types of sockets, the nodes have to be replaced. Many times, the increased computing power in the nodes means either putting much fewer of them in a rack to keep power and cooling within limits, or redesigning the datacenter, and essentially building a whole new supercomputer.","4,793 followers",Jan Christian Meyer,2.7K,2.2K,6.7M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-happens-to-outdated-supercomputers
8,"Roadrunner was a supercomputer built by IBM for the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico, USA. The US$100-million Roadrunner was designed for a peak performance of 1.7 petaflops. It achieved 1.026 petaflops on May 25, 2008, to become the world's first TOP500 LINPACK sustained 1.0 petaflops system.IBM Roadrunner was shut down on March 31, 2013. While the supercomputer was one of the fastest in the world, its energy efficiency was relatively low. Roadrunner delivered 444 megaflops per watt vs the 886 megaflops per watt of a comparable supercomputer.

9,"In the 90s I ended up with a super computer from a defunct savings and loan. A Burroughs Series A Mini main frame. I bought it at a sale for a bid of $2. No one else was interested. I expected to put it online. The OS would cost more than a house. I was told I needed a cold room to run it. The combined power consumption might equal a small town. Might have made a good heater. I tore it apart and used its cabinets for toolboxes. Re-purposed the motors and fans. Used the hard drive platters for an art project. The circuit boards eventually went to the trash.
