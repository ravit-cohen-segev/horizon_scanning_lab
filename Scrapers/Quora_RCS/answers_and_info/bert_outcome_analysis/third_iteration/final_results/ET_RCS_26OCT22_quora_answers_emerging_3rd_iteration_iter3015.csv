From then point on it became impossible to sew together hides to make clothing and the lack of fishing hooks meant that despite being Island dwellers the locals stopped eating fish. Other things like spear throwers, stoned hafted tools, nets and the iconic boomerang were also discarded.In much the same spirit as my answer here;Use it or lose it, once forgotten only the vagaries of reintroduction by outsiders or reinvention can bring something back.","68,773 followers",Kanthaswamy Balasubramaniam,898,17.3K,413.3M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-benefits-of-modernity-or-advance-technology-vs-Wild-life

Even through the course of the Paleolithic, we started with relatively simple tools and techniques and slowly came up with more complicated ones.

And in general they had problems to solve and solved them by inventing new technologies.The effects of these little changes may not be quite so apparent from our great distance from them, but they were real. And then, in various places around the world independently but starting in the Middle East about 12,000 years ago, people invented and adopted agriculture.

4,"Since this is all hypothetical, and thus falls into science fiction, here goes—Some time in the next century, maybe by 2112, humans will venture out of the solar system. The first ships will be slow, but large enough that the crew can have kids and grow. Medical science will have extended our life spans to 120 years, so a young crew will have a long time to train up their replacements for when they die, since even at 1% of the speed of light they won’t live to see the end of the voyage. For something to keep from going crazy, there will be hundreds of scientific experiments to do.Not quite a dSince this is all hypothetical, and thus falls into science fiction, here goes—Some time in the next century, maybe by 2112, humans will venture out of the solar system.

Medical science will have extended our life spans to 120 years, so a young crew will have a long time to train up their replacements for when they die, since even at 1% of the speed of light they won’t live to see the end of the voyage. For something to keep from going crazy, there will be hundreds of scientific experiments to do.Not quite a decade out, say in 2121, they discover that when space is flat enough, space can be warped, and their velocity greatly increased. They still can’t pass the speed of light, but they manage to get their speed up to 31.83% of light speed, which is quite respectable and enough to finish their trip while they’re still alive. They send all their work back to earth, and the race is on to send out ships and find planets humans can live on. Once the first good planet is found, people will pool their money to build ships large enough to carry ten thousand people, enough so that a dozen ships sent to the same planet will have a large enough population for humans to survive if they lose contact with earth.About the time the population on Mars reaches a million people, scientists on a research ship sent out into the emptiness at a point where the gravity of a set of five stars balances discover that they can tap the vacuum energy for an unlimited energy source. It only works where space is flat enough, but once a “vac-tap” is built it will work anywhere space is flat enough. A colony ship under construction is turned into a “vac-tap” factory and sent off to join the research ship, and a new generation of ships is built that requires barely any fuel at all except for climbing out of and descending into the gravity wells of stars. With the new energy source, scout ships for exploration become feasible, and, guided by telescope images of planets around stars within fifty light years of earth explorers go out to check if the candidates TISA, the Terran International Space Agency, has pointed them to can actually be settled.By 2222, humans have colonies on eight worlds and are terraforming a dozen more, but the pickings of planets is still pretty slim, often being too large or too small even though they’re in the habitable zone around their stars. The race is no longer captive to the behavior of just one star, but its options are still limited. The struggle to expand goes on.Around 2500 this all changes when a young genius tweaks some equations and shows that it’s possible to generate a field where the inertia of whatever is inside the field can be cancelled as far as the rest of the universe is concerned. Another young genius figures out how to do it, resulting in an “inertia compensator” so ships can accelerate at twenty or more gravities but the crew only feels a one-gee field. As a result, the slow plodding to the stars becomes a fast jog.Skip a million years into the future. The sun is misbehaving, but the young geniuses’ discovery means it’s possible to wrap the earth in an inertial field and move the whole planet. The field generator is built, and the planet moves farther from our star where it’s safer.Six hundred million years later, the moon is replaced by an artificial sun, the inertial field is extended to include it, and instead of baking and burning, the birth world of the human race goes gliding off to a better stellar neighborhood.We now return you to your regularly scheduled reality.","105,664 followers",Dave Consiglio,4.1K,6.8K,91.6M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-benefits-of-modernity-or-advance-technology-vs-Wild-life

Let’s fast forward a thousand years, to 3022. Assuming we don’t kill ourselves off with global warming or something, and that we keep developing science and technology, what will we be capable of by then? To people of 3022, things like the Burj Khalifa skyscraper, MRNA vaccines, and the James Webb telescope will look something like the technology we see when we gaze backwards a thousand years - stone towers for defending monks from Viking attacks, leeches for removing excess blood, paper for writing on. Cool stuff, yes, but primitive.Now fast forward another thousand years, to 4022. They’ll look back on the marvels of a thousand years from now asGot that in your mind? Now go back to the image of the Burj Khalifa tower.That magnificent tower has 163 floors. It has amazing, fast elevators to get you to the top, but if they broke down you could climb up the steps. It has 2902 steps. Now let’s use that as a measuring stick. Let’s call the bottom floor of that tower the dawn of human civilization 10,000 years ago. Let’s call the top floor, 500 million years from now, when the sun is making life difficult on Earth. How many steps have we climbed so far? How many to go?The answer is that we’re currently just beginning to lift a foot off the ground floor, in the direction of the first step. We’ll make it to that first step in 173,022 AD. We’ll still be 2901 steps from the top floor.The future of 500 million years from now is unforeseeable in human terms. It’s conceivable that there will be humans - at least three other species, horseshoe crabs, jellyfish, and chambered nautiluses, have survived that long.

How fast the earth cools will vary dramatically.The surface of the earth isn’t going to get super cold immediately, but it will be fast. I would guess that somewhere around the third day it’s going to start to be uncomfortable for anyone without a good heat source. After a week the average earth temperature will be freezing. 0 deg Celsius, 32 deg Fahrenheit. It will vary tremendously depending on where you live.It will stay warmer longer near the oceans and get colder faster the farther you get from them and obviously what started out cold will just get colder. It will take 1–3 years for them to freeze over.We can get by for months this way, as the earth slowly cools, but after a year the average surface temperature of the earth will be -73 degrees Celsius, -100 Fahrenheit. An awful lot of people will run out of food and water well before then though.If you have a heat source you can survive much longer, but you’ll need food and water. Everyone who somehow managed to survive the cold but didn’t have an ongoing source of food and water will die when their food and water run out.If someone lived near geothermal activity in a well insulated structure and managed to get both heat and electricity, (light) from it indefinitely and had a hydroponic farm, they could go on for 10 to 20 years before the oxygen started to get cold enough to turn to liquid and become rain made of oxygen, and then as it got progressively colder it would become snow.Imagine going outside to get a pail of air to bring in and put over the fire so that it would warm up and you could breathe. So while earth still has plenty of oxygen, it’s not going to be in a form you can breathe. Let’s say that after about 30 years or so, everyone is dead.There are microbes and other life at the bottom of the oceans by geothermal vents. They are too deep for the sun to reach them and use other means to survive.

In a billion years from now the luminosity of the Sun will have increased by 10%, which brings the habitable zone much further out. Effectively this means that the Earth won’t be in the habitable zone anymore, and the temperature on Earth increases enough for surface water to start evaporating.So within a billion years we should have left the Solar System already. We intend to have humans on Mars by the 2030s, which is an incremental step towards colonizing other planets and moons. Whether we will succeed and eventually leave the Solar System behind us is not at all clear however. Mammals have an average species lifespan of 1 million years, with some persisting to 10 million years. But of course we have the means to protect ourselves and survive for longer, but equally we have the means to threaten our own lives. Whether we will survive may depend largely on whether we will succeed in colonizing other planets, because to distribute and colonize means to increase our chances of survival.I’m quite skeptical we will make it that far however. There seem to be periodic extinction events which may be linked to activity on Earth (like major volcanic eruptions) or even our position within the Milky Way as the Sun makes one orbit around the gravitational center every 230 million years, which may influence climate directly, or indirectly through asteroid attacks. If we haven’t colonized space by then, we may be crushed before we get the means to leave our Solar System.The Mass Extinction PeriodsWhatever the reasons for all five mass extinction events, we may have to expect another mass extinction event in 50–120 million years. Add to that the fact that some argue we are currently in a mass extinction event already, and the future seems quite gloomy. But it would be amazing if we are able to survive another 1000 years, let alone millions.Additionally, I’m quite skeptical we will be able to traverse between the stars in principle.

We’ve only had any civilization for 10k years (0.001% of that time), and only had discernible technological progress for 500 years, a comparative nanosecond.So if that technological progress were to continue for another five hundred yearsSince this is longer than the whole evolutionary path from multicellular organisms to us, it’s a pretty goLet’s just say one billion years before Earth is no longer in what we consider a habitable zone. We’ve only had any civilization for 10k years (0.001% of that time), and only had discernible technological progress for 500 years, a comparative nanosecond.So if that technological progress were to continue for another five hundred yearsSince this is longer than the whole evolutionary path from multicellular organisms to us, it’s a pretty good bet that evolution, if “we” survive that long, would make us unrecognizable in every conceivable dimension.Since the universe is structured in a way that precludes faster than light travel, we won’t be travelling faster than light, regardless of technology.On the other hand, assuming we survive and continue to develop technology for the next 1,000 years, it’s a plausible bet that we could build colony ships able to accelerate to 5% of the speed of light. If so, we could get people to the closest potentially habitable exoplanet we know of, Proxima Centauri B, in a century or two (allowing time to speed up and slow down). The farthest potentially habitable planet we know of is Kepler 443b, which is 2,540 light years away. So we could get a colony ship there in about 100,000 years. Let’s say we launched that ship two thousand years from now, and once it landed it took the colonists 80,000 years to fully populate and inhabit the planet, about as long as it took humans to do the same once we started leaving Africa. That’s still just a sliver of time, less than 200,000 years. We’ve still got 900,800,000 years to go before worrying about the sun.Conclusion: Long before the sun becomes a problem, if we solve our other potentially fatal problems and keep at it, we will have established colonies throughout the Milky Way and wouldn’t, as a civilization, have to worry too much about the sun running out of hydrogen.",55 followers,Michael Price,562,7.3K,4.1M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Will-humans-survive-the-death-of-the-sun-Will-humans-have-advanced-technology-enough-to-migrate-to-a-planet-of-another-star-Will-they-perish-as-a-result-of-death-of-the-sun-Or-will-they-have-already-been-wiped-out-by-an-earlier-event
19,"One of the great fallacies of “scientific” edutainment is that the human species will witness the death of the Sun. Even the most prominent pop-science figures postulate that humans will escape to other planets and other star systems to avoid the death of the Sun and our solar system.Scientifically speaking, that is absurd.Humans, as a species, will be...","220,554 followers",Franklin Veaux,3K,47.3K,782.4M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Will-humans-survive-the-death-of-the-sun-Will-humans-have-advanced-technology-enough-to-migrate-to-a-planet-of-another-star-Will-they-perish-as-a-result-of-death-of-the-sun-Or-will-they-have-already-been-wiped-out-by-an-earlier-event
