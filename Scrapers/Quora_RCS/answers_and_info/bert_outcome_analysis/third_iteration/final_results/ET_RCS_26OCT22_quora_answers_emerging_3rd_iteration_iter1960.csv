There may be shortcomings due to the market being down this year, but still of you have decent ability, then there won't be much of an issue.There are surely options for students from RTU and just because few colleges are not performing well, you can't say that there is no future.Just work on your skills, and network with good people. Specifically work on your technical / programming skills, you will surely gNo, it is not like that.I can see that you are from Techno India NJR institute, udaipur.

Well, unfortunately, those microbots are impossible, but there is a similar technology that’s being developed in real life.The idea is to build tiny replicators that can create more of themselves, like a sort of super bacteria that never stops replicating. Such a technology would be“…the first replicator assembles a copy in one thousand seconds, the two replicators then build two more in the next thousand seconds, the four build another four . . in less than two days, theyNanotechnology, but in a really cool way.You remember the microbots in Big Hero 6, right?

Such a technology would be“…the first replicator assembles a copy in one thousand seconds, the two replicators then build two more in the next thousand seconds, the four build another four . . in less than two days, they would outweigh the Earth; in another four hours, they would exceed the mass of the Sun and all the planets combined …”Of course, self-replicators require materials, so they aren’t going to spread through space or anything. But they would have an abundance of material on Earth, especially of carbon, which would likely be the building blocks of such an assemblers. If you were carrying a jar of them and tripped and they spilled out, and they had no limit, they would quickly devour the entire earth with no way of stopping them.But here is where things get interesting: These tiny robots would have the ability to construct molecules from atoms, giving them the ability to produce amazing materials like graphene, cubes of apple, and even brain material.With advanced nanotechnology in the form of self-replicators, the entire world would experience a revolution. Think for a second about what wouldn’t change in the face of machines that can produceProduction jobs would cease. The price of every item ever created would be lowered massively. Supercomputers and experiments regarding brain material would become almost commonplace. Terraforming other planets would take years if not months. And all of this is actuallyThere is a lot of power contained within those tiny machines.","5,990 followers",Jens Böttiger,566,2.6K,17.6M,2017,https://www.quora.com/Is-there-no-future-for-engineering-in-the-field-of-information-technology-at-Rajasthan-Technical-University-in-the-upcoming-years
2,"You don’t advance technology as a monolith. Germany is a leader in material science and mechanical engineering.Germany is sub-par in software engineering and in its physical communication infrastructure. This is in part due to persistent cultural wariness of surveillance technologies like social media. People aren’t keen to fund the infrastructure to make mass surveillance easier, and politicians don’t want to be seen as pushing for the capability.Germany also has the capability to advance nuclear technology, but doesn’t due to mass scientific illiteracy among the voting population that falselYou don’t advance technology as a monolith.

Germany is not the most technologically advanced country. It could be pretty close, but there are major elements of society who dedicate themselves to making sure that Germany uses inferior technology that kills more people, damages the environment more, costs more money, and will cause the total collapse of Earth’s biosphere due to a runaway greenhouse effect. Mostly in the Green Party. Because radiation from nuclear accidents is apparently scarier than way more people dying of regular pollution constantly and the total annihilation of all life on Earth as the oceans boil away.","68,787 followers",Kanthaswamy Balasubramaniam,898,17.3K,413.5M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-is-your-opinion-about-the-upcoming-advanced-technology
3,"They have the four greatest advantages today(a) They have the Required Money for Research and Development(b) They have the Brains available to handle advanced Research - most of whom have learnt requisite skills from Foreign Countries and are ready to further the education for millions of chinese.(c) They have a Low Saturation Point since they were barely technology sufficient even 5 years ago. This means they have a(d) They have the worlds largest Capable populationBut their greatest Advantage - UNITYChinese Nationalism is trulyThey have the four greatest advantages today(a) They have the Required Money for Research and Development(b) They have the Brains available to handle advanced Research - most of whom have learnt requisite skills from Foreign Countries and are ready to further the education for millions of chinese.(c) They have a Low Saturation Point since they were barely technology sufficient even 5 years ago. This means they have a(d) They have the worlds largest Capable populationBut their greatest Advantage - UNITYChinese Nationalism is trulyPlus the fact that they dont have to waste time to pacify voters to vote for them is another great advantage.As on Date -Another reason for their rapid development is thatThey are developing strongly in areas where they have tremendous demand.Railways, Infrastructure, Construction, Fast Speed Low Latent Communication, Robotics etc.Like the 1990s rapid surging growth of Computers in the USAIts why they are very likely to crack Semiconductor manufacture by 2030. Because they have a very hungry demand and loads of money and a very intelligent and trained populace.","5,360 followers",Valerio Cietto,677,2.4K,9.1M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-is-your-opinion-about-the-upcoming-advanced-technology
4,Extremely advanced. Jor-El had the techonology available to send a spacecraft through a warp hole and plot the coordinates.Kryptonian crystal technology could build massive high tech buildings in no timeand massive warships that are powerful enough to destroy a planet. this can be grown from a single crystal.which Luthor was able to load with kryptonite to harm SupermanThey also have phantom drives which can send people to the Phantom Zone and can be used for space travelExtremely advanced.
