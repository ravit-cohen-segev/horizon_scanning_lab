When there have been instabilities, often technological advancement was how we reestablished stability. Consider, for example, the recent pandemic. The rush to develop a vaccine based on new technology-particularly the mNRA platform, allowed us to develop a vaccine in record time and will be instrumental in allowing society to return to normal.Alternatively, although you can say humans have been at war even during relatively primitive times, technological innovation has made our capacity for destruction scale. Consider the difference between the damage hunter gatherer war technology can inflict versus nuclear weapons. So while technology can be a god send, it can also be humanity’s destruction.And, in fact, we see that sort of threat from the development of the Internal Combustion Engine, industrialization, as well as other technologies and how it has led to a climate crisis due to the burning of fossil fuels. Then again, on the flip side, technology is how we will solve the climate crisis. In order to solve the crisis, we have to develop feasible carbon sequestration technologies, renewable energy technologies, and so on.Ultimately, the best I can say is that technology is a double edged sword.",3 followers,Mark Bradford,12.8K,579,2.5M,UNKNOWN,https://www.quora.com/Is-it-possible-that-increasing-and-advancing-technology-could-lead-to-instability-throughout-the-world-especially-when-it-comes-to-warfare
1,"Yes, it’s very possible. Great question btw. It’s really a matter of opinion, but the world is destabilising militarily. While the proliferation of nuclear weapons has seen almost no major global conflicts in the last 70 years, the rise of non-state actors has led to a new type of warfare. These non-state actors include terrorist organisations like AQT and IS, major factions like Hezbollah (sometimes listed as terrorist groups due to usage of terrorist tactics) and PMC’s like the Russian-supported one in Syria. There was a line in CoD or Battlefield (not sure which one) about war changing dueYes, it’s very possible. Great question btw.

There was a line in CoD or Battlefield (not sure which one) about war changing due to proxy wars fought on behalf of states by non-state actors. Also the use of drones will most likely become a major factor. Advanced combat drones are the perfect soldiers: they don’t defect, they don’t get PTSD, or need to be trained, and they don’t hesitate. They are the perfect soldiers. But maybe it’s the very imperfections of soldiers that end wars; people who have seen its brutality, it’s futility and it’s stupidity. Drones have non of that. They almost enjoy war, since it’s what they were programmed to do, and they never know anything but war. If wars were fought 100% by them, wars would never end. There would be no-one to wish the soldiers home, no-one returning home telling of how awful it all was. And so the 2 sides would just send in the drones, and war would become a game. The receiving end? They civilians. The people who have to stand by and watch while there homes are destroyed and their loved ones are killed, like all wars. However, this time, they would never get to return home.","68,794 followers",Kanthaswamy Balasubramaniam,898,17.3K,413.6M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Is-it-possible-that-increasing-and-advancing-technology-could-lead-to-instability-throughout-the-world-especially-when-it-comes-to-warfare

The PopulatioThere is a thesis that was released in the mid 19th century known as Malthusian theory, named after Thomas Malthus. The thesis, (simplified) is that any particular region can only support a limited population and that when the population reaches a critical level, that plague and famine would restore the balance.Malthus look at data over 1000 years in the Uk which indicated a pattern. The Population of England would go from a healthy and growing 3 million all the way up to 5 million only to collapse to famine and plague until it fell back down to 3 million. It would then stabilize and grow back up to 5 million, before collapsing again.This thesis proved true until agricultural and economic changes, (right up until the time of Thomas Malthus coincidentally) when new techniques in farming, new techniques for trade finance and new technologies resulted in the cap disappearing.The problem is that, although the maximum number is exponentially higher, the fact is there is still a maximum limit that is sustainable and if we believe in moist scientific environmental studies over the past 1/2 century, that cap is between 500 million and 1 billion.Now, Im sure you are aware that the population is at the 8 billion mark and for the most part, still growing. How is that possible? Continued technological advancement has continued to balloon the population at the cost of environmental sustainability. We are rapidly approaching the new Malthusian population cap however and we can expect a long period of decline and mass death on a global scale. It is caused by blind and greed based technological advancement and unlike previous era’s of plague and death, this time the environment may not be recoverable.Regarding warfare. i think this is the least of our worries. AI in particular, does not need to be particularly intelligent to be insurmountable. A good example is, that if you send a t5housand row boats to attack a modern carrier fleet, you can be sure that after 10 or 20 were destroyed, the remainder would surrender. AI will not. Equally, if you send 1000 infantry men to liquidate a city’s population, 99% of the soldiers will refuse orders, an AI will not.So this can be the great equalizer in future generations. All you would need is a manufacturing base and basic AI and you have a fanatical army that has no fear and will follow amoral orders on request. The great powers can still do massive damage in war, but the middle powers now have a weapon that is inexpensive and through attrition, can be devastatingly powerful.For example, a middle power such as Syria is not much of a threat to neighbouring middle power Iran. (using allied states to be a political). The armies are similar but Iran’s greater population base gives a major advantage, Now imagine if the vanguard of the Syrian army was 50 000 AI tank bots. Able to target faster, willing to kill without ethics or fear, They could be unstoppable.Similarly, imagine that same army of AI tanks used against the Russian army. Much more capable of defending herself, you can imagine that the Russian would eventually defeat Syria but the loses would be tangible.

7,"“The Sands of Iwo Jima” was directed by the busy if undistinguished Allan Dwan in 1948 who helmed more than 400 feature films. You read that right. 400. One of his better efforts was this WWII film starring John Wayne about the horrifying Pacific battle that saw 24,053 American casualties, by far the highest single-action losses in Marine Corps history. Of these, a total of 6,140 died. The Japanese lost all but 200 of their 21,000 forces. It was Dwan’s intention to make an anti-war film but it didn’t work out that way with audiences.

Instead, its charge echoed through the decades, claiming many young men who found in John Wayne and “Sands” a lodestone of American values for which they were prepared to serve and die. Though the antithesis of Wayne’s later bone-headed promo for Vietnam, 1968’s “The Green Berets,” “Sands” fired the imaginations of enough of America’s first post-war generation to encourage them to sign up for the war in Vietnam. In Ron Kovic’s 1976 antiwar memoir “Born on the Fourth of July,” made into movie in 1989 with Tom Cruise, Kovic describes his childhood identification with the film. “Every time I heard it (the Marine Corps hymn,) I would think of John Wayne and the brave men who raised the flag on Iwo Jima that day. I would think of them and cry,” he wrote. When a group of recruits at Camp Pendleton in the 1960s were asked why they joined the Marine Corps, half of them answered that they had enlisted because of the John Wayne movies they had seen. “Sands” refuses to portray war as easy or heroic. It contains moments of terrible moral doubt as well as painful loss. The singing of the Marine Corps hymn at the end reinforces the message that the soldiers’ sacrifice was not in vain even if it is shown as tragically unnecessary.

Or it could still stand, if I'm remembering correctly it may be used as an explanation in Doctor Strange.That being said is Thor using tech for his powers,I'd say no. Assuming that Asgardians are using advanced technology I'd also assume they've performed some extensive bioengineering to become as naturally powerful as they've become.So if Mjolnir and the other Asgardian weapons are tech I'd say the natural abilities they have may be the result of highly advanced bioengineering and tapping into otherworldly energies (As explained in Doctor Strange). As far as Thor goes I think his weather Manipulation and enhanced Physiology would be the result of Enhancements he was born with and not a piece of tech he has to consciously use.I could be wrong though a lot of this is speculation and as I said I'd perfer if they just went with magic being magic but,there you have it.","18,451 followers",Nathan Stanish,12.5K,2.3K,62.5M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Is-it-possible-that-increasing-and-advancing-technology-could-lead-to-instability-throughout-the-world-especially-when-it-comes-to-warfare
