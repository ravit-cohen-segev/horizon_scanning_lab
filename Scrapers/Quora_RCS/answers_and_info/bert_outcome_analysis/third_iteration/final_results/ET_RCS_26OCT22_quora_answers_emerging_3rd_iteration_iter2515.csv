Since human beings are sentient entities, seeing human beings as parasites isYou seem to somehow have confused utilitarianism with nihilism.",18 followers,Asim Qureshi,12.7K,996,156M,2018,https://www.quora.com/As-advanced-technology-allows-us-to-quantify-more-abstract-things-will-society-shift-towards-utilitarianism
1,"Because, my friend Abhishek, we are only humans, not gods.1) The Epistemological ImpossibilityIt is epistemologically impossible. <Each of us has an infinitesimal view of reality, that is more garbled than clear. More often than not, we are unable to accurately predict the impact of Policy X even on ourselves even if we are looking only in the near term, even we are looking only atBecause, my friend Abhishek, we are only humans, not gods.1) The Epistemological ImpossibilityIt is epistemologically impossible. <Each of us has an infinitesimal view of reality, that is more garbled than clear. More often than not, we are unable to accurately predict the impact of Policy X even on ourselves even if we are looking only in the near term, even we are looking only at just a small subset of possible impacts. But to execute utilitarianism correctly, we must predict out into the distant future — looking at all the reverberations of that policy touching everything else in the world. And because we are merely humans, we cannot know how Policy X will continue to impact all the other infinite variables in the universe out into the the distant future.But that only disproves that we cannot with any reasonable hope of success, know the positive and negative outcomes for even ourselves of even just one Policy X.To continue our utilitarian analysis, we would have to compare the outcomes of this PolicyX, compared to all the other alternative possible Policies that we could do instead, so that we could select the one best. Unfortunately, what we can’t calculate for just one policy, we cannot repeat for an infinite number of alternative policies.And further, remember that utilitarianism requires that we do this not only for ourselves — which we can’t — but that we repeat it for all 7 billion people currently on the earth, the vast majority of whom we do not even know. And then continue to do it for all the possible different sets of future people who might come onto this earth under all the various infinite number of alternative policies.Finally, to complete any single utilitarian calculation, we would have to have a way, to sum across different individuals, numbers that convey for an example that a bad outcome for Joe of one policy alternative would be equal to twice the good outcome of the policy for Fred. And being able to mathematically compare different people’s subjective utilities, in just itself, is a psychometric impossibility.Thus, utilitarianism is epistemologically impossible.2) The Problem of ImplementationBecause it is not sufficient to know the knowledge of which path will be best for all mankind (a knowledge that is available only to a god), we would need a god to implement it,And not only do humans suffer from an inability to execute perfect implementation, but they also have a tendency to cheat for temporary advantage — sometimes consciously, but way more often than you would think, unconsciously.3) The Requirement of EthicsThus, your perfect utilitarian calculation might calculate that the best outcome would be to torture for decades a thousand people, and if perfectly executed (with the exact number of screams and exact right volumes of blood), the calculation shows that that path would give aHuman ethics however prohibits using other humans as abusable, disposable variables in some cold (impossible) calculation of what is best for “society”. Human ethics requires that we respect each and every human as valuable in and of themselves and not an automaton that utilitarian psychopaths can dispose of to build their utopia.And that means that we respect the self-ownership of every single human. So, when the utilitarian implementation requires that Fred do X with his body, but Fred does not want to do X with his body, the utilitarian may think nothing of sticking sharp objects into Fred until Fred does X, but the ethicist would say, “Hey, hold up there, ethical violator!! That there’s Fred’s body, not yours. He is not your slave and you are not his god and master.”Now, you can make the claim that your impossible implementation of your impossible calculation absolutely requires the sacrifice of Fred’s body. Even if you were right, which you cannot possibly know that you are, you would still be an ethically evil human.See Related:0523: The impossibility of utilitarianism1107: Can a computer theoretically do better than the market at allocating scarce resources?1172: What is the strongest argument against libertarianism?0444: Would libertarians support an omniscient God as a political ruler?1001: What is the hardest argument you face against libertarian ethics?1144: Do libertarians believe that the needs of individuals trump the needs of society?1055: What is more important: policies that work better, or policies that are more ethical?1250: What is the role of society in libertarian philosophy?1272: Is society better if servers were paid a living wage rather than tips?0889: Why can’t libertarians tell us precisely what their future society will look like?1030: Are authoritarians good people with policy differences, or just evil people?0664: What is the difference between consequential and ethical libertarianism?1205: What one characteristic do all libertarians share?→ More essays about <→ Return to the <<, Epistem, Conseq, Individual, ImptEthics,>","105,667 followers",Dave Consiglio,1.1K,6.8K,91.6M,2019,https://www.quora.com/As-advanced-technology-allows-us-to-quantify-more-abstract-things-will-society-shift-towards-utilitarianism

And guess which way their curriculae skew — to Fine Arts or to STEM? How many STEM universities'll open this week in America? Statistically? Guess? Zero. What percent of all tertiary education grads in America degree in STEM? <20%. China? >40%. How many STEM grads does America produce in a year? Well, 5 years ago: 568,000. And China the same year? 4,700,000. Conservative projections of China's STEM grad growth rate are 20%/year. Optimistic projections of America's? 2%/year — barely outstripping average annual population growth. In 2016 China was graduating 8 TIMES as many “advanced"" STEM professionals as was America. By 2021 China's tally runs nearer to +/— 9,000,000. And America's? +/- 600,000. I'll do the math for our American contingent. 15 TIMES as many “advanced"" STEM graduates . . .America lacks the educational (esp. tertiary ed.) resources to increase its PhD production beyond that stagnation level 2%/annum. China? Enough resources toAnd China is positioning to ‘pull the rug out from under' the likes of MIT, Stanford, and Harvard — endowing, building, tooling, and hiring the best STEM professorial minds out from under those 'long-of-tooth' American 'acmes’. On the slate are 10 MIT-Stanford class STEM universities of the sort that empower academics to Nobel prizes.So.Why, when lacking 'advanced’ STEM doctorate production capacity do the American first rank STEM universities encourage Chinese (among other) students (who've completed 'Bachelors’ programs with academic status that, if it were athletic, would qualify them for the Olympics) partake of their degree programs? Why?Because to maintain their status as ‘the best' they need to produce recognizable — or, better yet, 'recognized' — graduates. And, frankly, the American public isn't able to provide enough of that class of student to fill its programs. And is less able to do so each passing year.Now that China's literacy rate bests that of the US? Now that China's (all important for STEM) numeracy — especially numeracy that includes and builds on calculus and statistics (calculus mainly because it is mathematically both mind-expanding and logic/analysis enhancing — and statistics because STEM increasingly relies on ‘data-crunching’)? Now that both those are the case? Not only does China have a 'slam-dunk’ advantage on the basis of population alone — thatMeaning that when the world's ‘elite’ academic institutions forage for the semi-refined student talent required to maintain its 'elite academic status' they're statistically (increasingly so) likely to find them in China.Ironically, in order for the American 'pre-eminent’ institutions to remain rated 'pre-eminent’ they're increasingly dependent on Chinese students for a successful effort.But don't worry. By 2030 China will be offering the world's best student minds full scholarships at their Stanford/MIT/Harvard ranked schools. Even Americans (because, in America, for each “Good Will Hunting"" there are dozens of gifted students who America fails).By the way. Research the percentage of STEM teacher-researchers in America's top tier STEM faculties who are ‘borrowed’ from China. Were those faculty members driven back to China — America would lose a massive contribution to that relatively stagnating academic resource.America depends on Chinese minds — student, researcher, professorial — to simply maintain its increasingly 'also-ran’ STEM status.’",0 followers,Steven Henninger,924,512,153.3K,2022,https://www.quora.com/As-advanced-technology-allows-us-to-quantify-more-abstract-things-will-society-shift-towards-utilitarianism

22,"Andy Farra made great points about the technologies used in real estate. At its core, real estate is still a relationship-based business, and there is only so much that technology can do.However, a key technology that is used now in real estate are digital signup sheets (vs. old school pen + paper).

23,"If you don’t already own your own home, go buy one. A house, a condo, whatever floats your boat. THAT’s the best way. Live in it for a year, then go buy another one and turn the first into a rental. Wash, rinse, repeat. That’s the easiest and best way. Keep in mind when you are buying the first one what you can rent it for, what upkeep will cost on it (if there’s a big yard that has to be tended), etc. and so forth with each purchase. If you can, find a small apartment building (4 units or less, otherwise you get into other laws and taxable things) and live in one of the units. Most people donIf you don’t already own your own home, go buy one. A house, a condo, whatever floats your boat. THAT’s the best way.

If you can, find a small apartment building (4 units or less, otherwise you get into other laws and taxable things) and live in one of the units. Most people don’t know you can buy this with a regular mortgage, as it would be your primary residence. After a year, buy another property and move again.If you’re looking for other ways, here are my suggestions:Go to a 3-day seminar on flipping houses and real estate investment. But do NOT buy into their education plan. Those things are created to make money strictly off the education pitch they are selling and most people just can’t do what the “guru” did to get big enough to be able to “teach” in the first place, because mostly it was have the cash in his pocket to start with. Go in and soak up what they are talking about and network with other folks who are there for the same reasons. If you find a real estate agent who is there to learn more about it and network, you’ve struck gold.After this, join some “Meet-Up” groups online specific to real estate investing and you’ll be able to network with LOADS of people and, because you’ll have been to the 3-day seminar, you’ll know the language of what those people are talking about. Look up ROIs, cash flow, and Cap Rates.I can tell you from experience that the best real estate investments are buy and hold properties. They are long term, usually have a great growth rate and will pay for themselves. This is a real retirement plan. The first one might be hard to pull the trigger on (I paid cash for mine), but once you have the first one, the rest come a LOT easier. Not just to pull the trigger, but for financing them too. Banks love to lend money to investors who already own investment property.A lot of people will tell you to flip houses for the quicker big bucks (this is a lot of what they want you to believe in the 3-day), and to do it with other people’s money (hard money, private investors, etc). What they won’t tell you is that, unless you can at least flip 4–5 houses a year, you can’t really make money at it because of the time invested, labor and the holding costs. Plus if you don’t have the cash to do your own flips, you have to use a private investor or hard money lender and a large percentage of hard money lenders are a lot like loan sharks, which increases your holding costs. AND once you start flipping, if you aren’t using your own cash, you kind of have to keep flipping for the income to keep coming in. Location for flipping is also key, for what kind of money you can use, primarily because of labor costs. You can flip houses in Nashville for a huge profit, even using hard money, but try to do the same thing almost anywhere in the state of Maryland or the metro Washington, DC area with hard money, you’re doing great to see $10,000 profit.There are other types of real estate investing you should research too:",356 followers,Gordon Miller,1.8K,10K,165.5M,2018,https://www.quora.com/As-advanced-technology-allows-us-to-quantify-more-abstract-things-will-society-shift-towards-utilitarianism
24,"There are way too many technological advancements and new inventions that can and will impact the way that the real estate market functions.One of the examples that come to mind is the drone technology.Although it might seem completely unrelated to real estate, but drones can be used to capture images and videos of lands and properties alike in a way that was not available before.This can be utilized by investors, agents, realtors, and tenants for viewing properties and lands from all possible angles and in real time, which would save the time and effort which are otherwise required to travelThere are way too many technological advancements and new inventions that can and will impact the way that the real estate market functions.One of the examples that come to mind is the drone technology.Although it might seem completely unrelated to real estate, but drones can be used to capture images and videos of lands and properties alike in a way that was not available before.This can be utilized by investors, agents, realtors, and tenants for viewing properties and lands from all possible angles and in real time, which would save the time and effort which are otherwise required to travel to the property’s location and looking at it.Another technology which might be utilized in real estate marketing is augmented reality. This can allow landlords, tenants, realtors and agents to show the same property in several different conditions, with different interior designs or with different sets of furniture that are all virtual, for the purpose of projecting people’s imaginations on the property that they’re interested in.The list goes on of course. It comes down to each individual’s capability to imagine new and different uses for existing and emerging technologies.","5,990 followers",Jens Böttiger,566,2.6K,17.6M,2017,https://www.quora.com/As-advanced-technology-allows-us-to-quantify-more-abstract-things-will-society-shift-towards-utilitarianism
