Apple has been struggling to innovate since Jobs died. It’s an insular, almost arrogant company - which was fine with Jobs at the helm, but without him I don’t think the management has been as effective. Most of Apple’s revenues comes from the iPhone which has been un-inspirational in recent cycles and in many ways outclassed by rival products - and this dependability on the iPhone also means the company is not as diversified as Google or Microsoft. If Apple loses its sex appeal with fickle consumers, like Blackberry did - it just takes a few bad product cycles for that to happen - things could turn around for the worse relatively fast.Saying this, I don’t think any of them are going to fall anytime soon.",26 followers,Balaji Viswanathan,3.7K,5.6K,427M,2017,https://www.quora.com/Who-are-the-angels-willing-to-invest-in-companies-that-build-on-top-of-established-Microsoft-technologies

The internet kicked off a whole era of interconnection and information, as well as the creating a platform for e-commerce as well as online banking. Games are now downloaded rather than bought as CDs, and online advertisements formed the foundation of platforms such as YouTube. The internet also aided in the science field; scientists all around the world are able to publish their findings, greatly accelerating the development of new technologies.Computers are devices which we use to access the internet. There is one problem though; they are clunky, and not practical for mobile use. This is where the smartphone comes in. The smartphone brought the internet into our pockets, helping us stay connected wherever we are. The most notable product is the iPhone, which revolutionized the smartphone industry. These smartphones have now diverged into more than just an internet/communications device. Most smartphones have screens of equal, or sometimes greater quality than that of TV screens, so they’ve become your pocket cinemas. They have adopted high resolution cameras, and with the ease of sharing the photos to social media, they have become point-and-shoot replacements for many people. And finally, with powerful onboard processor and graphics, games such as GRID Autosport, which 3 years ago was a console exclusive, are now running in your pocket devices.Looking into the future, I am expecting 3 upcoming technologies that will really shine and revolutionize the industry. They are probably AI, graphene, and AR.AI is the ability for a machine to make cognitive decisions based on past experience. It is the technology that will power autonomous vehicles, accurate image recognition and language translation, as well as research automation.The next one is graphene. It is a carbon allotrope similar to graphite, but only one atom thick. It is much better than copper at conducting electricity, it is stronger than steel. Graphene can be used in place of copper as the interconnects inside the CPU, and because of its low resistance it can generate much less heat, raise efficiency, as well as go far beyond 5GHz clock speeds. Graphene can be used to coat the electrodes of batteries, giving them higher capacity and dramatically shorter recharge times. Maybe graphene can be used in place of silicon for transistors, as they can operate at lower voltages.Finally, I think the next big thing is Augmented Reality, or AR, specifically AR glasses. Just like how smartphones allowed us to carry the internet in the palm of our hands, AR glasses can project the UI right into our field of view, forming a seamless experience. AR glasses have huge potential, such as letting you test fit virtual furniture in your house, allow you to overlay notifications right into your field of view, or even highlight the lane on a highway while you are driving. Right now, there are companies releasing AR glasses, but they simply aren’t ready. They lack the software necessary for an intuitive user experience, such as AR world tracking, and they are clunky, not something the average consumer would like to wear outside. That said, however, Comercial AR glasses are said to be released sometime in 2020. It is possible that those glasses will be powered by AI for its object recognition, as well as utilize lithium-graphene batteries in order to pack enough energy while not making the glasses chunky.",0 followers,Lucas Martin,6.4K,65,4.2M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Who-are-the-angels-willing-to-invest-in-companies-that-build-on-top-of-established-Microsoft-technologies

8,"Now, I'm American. So there is a bias.But I think I'll say the Abrams, next to maybe the Merkava, and probably a lot of the other Allied tanks. Sure, people say it's the T14 or K2, but they never seen combat yet. They could be the most expensive tanks ever, but if they don't perform well, it's pointless. I have doubts about the T14 since it's an autoloader, which means it's ammo won't be in a secured blowout box if the ammunition charges ignite. And as we saw in WW2 and even Ukraine, it's not very smart to have your ammo laying around in the turret basket. So until the T14 or other tanks haveNow, I'm American.

This will allow all of 3 crew member (Russian like autoloader so no need of loader member) to be sit in a well-armored capsule at the front of the hull, and that mean designers can focus much more armored on the hull since the only thing that still in the turret in the autoloader and of course, ammunition; not like traditional ones focus their armor on turret more. And since everyone will sit in the hull, the bore evacuator is no need too, hence simplified the production process.Here is a GIF showing how bore evacuator works.Hell yeah, no need for bore evacuator anymore. Let’s go Ivan, time to crush some murikans.Dammit, we still need that thing man, THAT THING.

Yes, she is a LT, not MBT, despite her big dimension. Don’t tell her about how fat is she, cause girls hate it when they gain weight!Here is the video showing you what this girl can get.It has an unmanned turret with autoloader like T-14 as well, featuring a 105mm or 120mm smothbore cannon, firing NATO standard rounds, but the most notable feature is that it can become “invisible”. The PL-01 uses stealth technology. It has a thermal camouflage which makes it harder to detect with thermal sensors. It is claimed that the whole vehicle will be covered with radio wave absorbent material. However it is unknown if angular shapes of this tank are intended to reduce radar cross-section or just to give a more futuristic look.As you can see, the thermal camouflage system make it look like a car more than a tank hull.Just concept, haven’t entered production like T-14 Armata yet!

10,"I’d like to argue in favor of the PL-01 Polish light tank.It’s a marvelous sight to see that countries are still developing their own armored vehicles. Now, let’s get onto statistics!The Pl-01 is armed with either a 105mm or 120mm cannon, depending on the situation. It also features a top-mounted UKM-2000 7.62mm machine gun. The suspension on the vehicle features a torsion bar and it’s engine produces anywhere from 940hp to further on.
