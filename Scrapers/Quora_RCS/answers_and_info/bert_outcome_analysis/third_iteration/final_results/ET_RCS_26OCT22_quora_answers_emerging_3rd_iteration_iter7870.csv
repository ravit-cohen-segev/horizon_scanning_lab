2,"Q: “The fastest speed achieved in space was 165,000 mph. What’s stopping us from getting higher speeds in space since there’s no resistance in space?”Short answer: ThrustA typical rocket burns fuel to make thrust. Out of fuel = out of thrust = no faster will you go.There’s a neat thing called “the rocket equation” that points out if you want more thrust, you need more fuel. More fuel means more weight, and that means you won’t go much faster even with the extra fuel. This just means going faster means taking more fuel with you, and we don’t mean a little extra fuel… it takes more and more andQ: “The fastest speed achieved in space was 165,000 mph.

Out of fuel = out of thrust = no faster will you go.There’s a neat thing called “the rocket equation” that points out if you want more thrust, you need more fuel. More fuel means more weight, and that means you won’t go much faster even with the extra fuel. This just means going faster means taking more fuel with you, and we don’t mean a little extra fuel… it takes more and more and more to go faster.So that’s rocket fuel, but there are other ways to get going faster, and the most significant is gravity. Voyager II famously got a lot of mileage out of gravity assist “slingshots” as will the new Parker Solar Probe.But maybe you want to keep accelerating. For that, you need some other source of thrust. There do exist electromagnetic thrusters which make extremely efficient use of their “fuel”. By using electrical power to provide the energy, these can accelerate their “fuel” particles to ludicrous exit velocities. These things tend to provide a very tiny amount of thrust, but they do it for a very long time. That could add up to higher final speeds than what we get with chemical rockets.Finally, to get unbounded speed, you need something with no fuel limits. (Edit: Andy below commented on my poor wording here… cleaning it up.) Theoretically, a solar sail could harness the momentum of light to provide thrust. But now we’re talking a TRULY tiny amount of thrust, and only while you’re flying away from the Sun, and only when close to it. There’s still some hope for the EM drive I guess. Presumably that would be better than a photon drive… somehow. Realistically, the solar panels are needed for infinite power, but to get decent thrust out of it, you really want a nuclear reactor.Since we’ve mentioned that light has momentum, we should mention light sails. There is talk of a plan to build a tiny light sail and hit it with a massive laser array. In that way, the energy used to accelerate it is coming from a remote source that doesn’t have to move. That would make the top speed of the craft bounded only by the amount of laser energy you could generate here… and relativity of course.Finally, I should mention project Orion. The plan with Orion was to power a spacecraft with nuclear explosions. You’d literally drop a nuke behind your rocket and set it off to give you a massive boost of thrust. The energy-to-mass ratio on a nuke is off the charts, so if you really needed to get moving fast, that’s probably how you’d have to do it.",33 followers,Dawson Perry,602,0,0,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-fastest-speed-possible-in-space-using-an-ion-drive

Seeing that like unlike the ion drive it needs no other type of fuel to work, and unlike the EMdrive we have more than enough evidence it would work.A ion drive will never come close to that! Not with current methods and technology.There are two ways to go about a Plasma Drive.You make a nuclear fusion reactor into a engine and you expel the plasma in a way that it makes you move. Basically it is like taking a lesson from the Orion Project, only instead of detonating nuclear bombs you create a contained nuclear reaction to propel the ship.Another way to go about it would be to use superconductors inside the main chamber in a wider circular configuration and along the exit path of the engine in a ever more narrow configuration. You then focus the electromagnetic field created in such a way that the field is used to push the ship. Leaving some of the chamber open to vent off any hazardous ionized particles into outerspace.",0 followers,Ron Brown,712,8.6K,37.1M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-fastest-speed-possible-in-space-using-an-ion-drive
4,"The established method for the fusion on Earth is to combine deuterium and tritium to make helium and a neutron.In order to do this, fusion reactors must recreate the conditions found in stars, where fusion naturally occurs.

Without proper confinement of the plasma, the reactor walls would get hot and the fusion fuel would get cold and the reaction would stop. The hot, electrically charged plasma must be isolated from the walls of the reactor using magnetic fields. The most advance machine for this purpose is “tokamak"". JET is the best performing tokamak in the world. In 1997, it produced 16MW of fusion power with 24MW input i.e. 65% as much energy out as was put in. It holds the world record for total fusion power produced and for getting closest to energy breakeven. Experiments have been built and much has been learned, but progress towards energy breakeven has slowed. It has yet to be reached almost 20-years after those momentous JET experiments.Currently, ITER experiment under construction in the south of France, will be over 30m tall and weigh about 23,000 tonnes. When ITER was being designed in the 1990s it believed that only feasible way to increase power was to increase size. However, the size and complexity of ITER has led to very slow progress, with first plasma now set for 2025 and the first use of tritium fuel not expected until well into the 2030s. The possibility of a smaller waybto fusion has fired the imagination of inventors, innovators and now investors. Ventures like Virgin Galactic and SpaceX, and now the Breakthrough Energy Coalition led by Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg, have large investments examples in new technologies. In the late 2000s, research from the European Commision found there was virtually no private investment in fusion technology. Nearly all money in fusion came through one single programme called EURATOM.In the past few years, fusion has gained the attention of high-profile technology backers such as Jeff Bezos, founder of Amazon, paul Allen of Microsoft and Peter Thiel, co-founder of payPal, together they have invested many tens of millions into private fusion ventures in the US. Tokamak Energy has enabled complex fusion engineering to be developed faster than it has for years and has a leading role in the race of fusion energy.Research into fusion began in the mid-20th century. In 2015 and 2016 papers were established that showed, for the first time, size is not important factor in fusion reactors. One of these papers 'On the Power and Size of tokamak Fusion Pilot Plants and Reactors’ has gone to have the most online downloads in the history of Nuclear Fusion journal. Tokamak Energy has developed 'high temperature’ superconducting (HTS) magnets using HTS tape that has remarkably high conductivity even in exceptionally high magnetic fields. The magnets can fit through the centre of a smaller reactor. Thus using private investment, Tokamak Energy has successfully overcome a key engineering problem of reducing reactor size while maintaining performance.Tokamak Energy aims to deliver a fusion power gain by 2020, first electricity by 2025 and a 100MW power plant by 2030. It's third device, a high-field spherical tokamak, is already nearing completion. The company plans to build five tokamaks-the fifth being a prototype commercial reactor that can be plugged into the grid to prove the concept of compact, modular fusion power stations.General Fusion in Canada is using a magnetised vortex approach based on scientific theory from 30-years ago. Currently this involves developing sub-systems that will be used to operate the reactor ahead of a prototype reactor build. Tri-Alpha Energy in California is addressing the challenge of heating up a plasma within its novel hydrogen-boron reactor, over next 3–4 years to validate its technology.Developer NuScale Power's explanation is typical: it says it offers a “shorter, more predictable” construction period, which reduces financial risks and costs, while the size of its prototype reactor ensures a far less complex and product. With a smaller, more cost effective and flexible nuclear energy intrastructure on the horizon, both fusion and fission are following an established trend across the energy industry for more distributed generation.As a scientific concept, it has grabbed the imagination since it was first identified as the source of energy in the sun. The new climate of investment and appetite for fresh approaches brings hope for a fusion future.The old jest is that fusion will forever be 30-years away. Tokamak Energy is working squarely on making it a reality much sooner. .",826 followers,George Dowson,4K,527,3.7M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-fastest-speed-possible-in-space-using-an-ion-drive

Currently everyone is striving towards the break even point (the point where the reactor will produce as much power as is put in), Current predictions reckon that this should be achieved the the 2030's so we could potentially hope to have functioning reactors producing up to 10x the input power by the middle of the century. ☺",8 followers,Tirtha Chakrabarti,622,690,2.8M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-fastest-speed-possible-in-space-using-an-ion-drive

It is remarkable that we (as a species) are even attempting it and more remarkable that we may well succeed.People seem to think that fusion is relatively easy, but it really isn’t. Even in the core of the sun, fusion generates only a small amount of net heat. A cubic metre of the sun’s fusing core only generates around 275 watts. That’s less energy output than we give off as body heat for an equivalent volume. The reason why the sun is so hot is because there are hundreds of thousands of miles of insulation (in the form of hot gas contained by gravity) around this heating centre.There’s a reason stars burn for billions of years, they really only burn slowly.Now consider the conditions at the core of the sun - 250 billion atmospheres, 15 million degrees (K or C doesn’t matter at this scale). And that is sufficient to make a piddly amount of heat per cubic metre. Scaled down to operations that would fit on Earth, that’s not going to cut it for power generation. You’d get more power out of a single large solar panel in good conditions. (That might seem odd but consider the sheer size of the sun, even “just” the core region).What’s more, we can’t achieve those sorts of pressures so we need much higher temperatures before we even start fusion; closer to 100 million degrees. We then need to surround this heating zone with the kind of insulation a few hundred thousand miles worth of mind-bogglingly dense gas and plasma provides (using superpowered magnets), and then we have to extract sensible energy without causing the whole reaction to stall and still end up with enough energy to outweigh the inevitable energy losses.I hope this gives you an idea of what an achievement creating a working fusion power plant will be.

The full-scale reactor weighs about 320 kg and produces 5 kW of electricity, enough to power a home. Other than the fact that it weighs a lot more than most appliances in your home, it could be manageable. Other than the cost, the potential harm from radiation, and the unavailability to the general public, it's perfectly suited for any home dweller with the desire to get off the grid and attract major attention from whoever you stole it from. It could probably cut your heating bill significantly since most of the energy from the reactor is generated as heat. However, there is another downside: It will not last a lifetime. It has a projected lifetime of around 3-5 years, so you would need to replace it every once in a while.However, development of small nuclear reactors is under way. Small plants are being designed and built as the desire of long-lasting energy in desolate places increases.

Brian Wang’s predictions do, however, not indicate any fusion technology achieving a commercial demonstration of electrical power before 2030 where the chart ends.Going a little further out on the limb than Brian Wang, I will predict that the first commercial fusion power plant that is cost competitive with fossil fuel and renewable energy power plant will be introduced in the 2035 time frame.Concept drawing of the LIFE laser fusion power plantThe following points cover potential problems with ICF technology that could retard the introduction of commercial laser fusion power plants.The obstacles for icf fusion are not just the energy of the driver, but also the fact that components of the laser fusion driver routinely gets destroyed every time the experimental laser is fired -The optics and neodymium glass active media used in NIF is subject to damage if light intensity in any one place is too high. LLNL has made substantial progress in reducing optical damageUnderstanding Optics Damage from Reflected Laser LightLLNL has become more skillful at finding and repairing or changing out damaged optics at NIFNational Ignition Facility tops 400 shots in FY16Recently LLNL delivered a more advanced fast pulse laser called HAPLS to the ELI Beamlines Prague facility that greatly reduces the chance of damage to the active media while significantly increasing laser power to petawatt power levels.Lawrence Livermore-developed petawatt laser system installed at ELI BeamlinesNIF is and R&D research facility - first of kind ICF fusion technology. NIF is not a fusion power plant prototype. The problems that have surfaced at NIF are engineering issues that have good solutions. There are no ""show stopper"" issues with ICF that have surfaced so far.Fast pulse laser driver technology is getting simultaneously more reliable, cheaper, and higher power.The peak power attainable in a laser pulse has increased by roughly a factor of 1,000 every 10 years.High-power Lasers By Todd Ditmirehttps://www.americanscientist.org/article/high-power-lasershttps://www.americanscientist.org/article/high-power-lasersICF fusion faces geopolitical obstacles, because icf and fusion bombs are relatedHistorically, virtually every nuclear application can be traced back to a military project. A military origin should not stop sound peaceful application of fusion in a power generation context.The opportunity to use and develop ICF fusion is actually a protected right for all nations under international Treaty.In the Non Proliteration Treaty Article 5 each party to this treaty is guaranteed ""any peaceful applications of nuclear explosions"" on a nondiscriminatory basis (United Nations 1975, Article V).The corresponding article reads:NPT Article V""Each Party to this Treaty undertakes to take appro-priate measures to ensure that, in accordance withthis Treaty, under appropriate international observa-tion and through appropriate international proce-dures, potential benefits from any peaceful applica-tions of nuclear explosions will be made available tonon-nuclear-weapon States Party to this Treaty on anondiscriminatory basis and that the charge to suchParties for the explosive devices used will be as lowas possible and exclude any charge for research anddevelopment.

Negotiations on this subject shall com-mence as soon as possible after the Treaty enters intoforce. Non-nuclear-weapon States Party to the Treatyso desiring may also obtain such benefits pursuant tobilateral agreements.""USPractical ICF Fusion is the only fusion reactor concept that has been successfully experimentally field tested (as components) and has been shown to make net energy today. Practical ICF Fusion Reactor uses a succession of small controlled nuclear bursts or explosions to produce commercially significant amounts of energy (Gigawatts level) reliably from fusion.Government leaders tend to reflect a perceived public preference for energy systems that promise to deliver smooth power instead of power produced in short controlled bursts. Billions of dollars of funding have been made available over the decades since the mid-1950s on a variety of Magnetic Confinement Fusion experiments (tokamaks, stellarators, mirror machines, etc.) over the decades that have never once produced any net energy from fusion (even for micro-seconds), in part because MCF fusion researchers and advocates promise (but do not actually deliver) smooth controlled release of MCF fusion power. Practical Inertial Confinement Fusion, on the other hand, produces power in a regular series of short controlled fusion bursts. This “pulse mode” of practical ICF power generation, and the military origins of the underlying technology, tends to scare to some extent the public and the public’s elected representatives in government who do not vote any funding for practical ICF fusion, even though practical ICF fusion is the only form of fusion that has generated any net energy from fusion in over 60 long years of fusion experimentation.Further Predictions for fusion regarding commercial power plant reliability -Creating and maintaining fusion conditions in plasma will be difficult for the first several decades of commercial MCF fusion. Complex MCF power plants that have extreme materials issues and place high temperature components adjacent to cryogenically cooled components will break down at high frequency leading to power plant unreliability.ICF fusion power plants, on the other hand, only need to maintain fusion conditions for about 10 nanoseconds on each shot. This is essentially an easier technical challenge than creating and then maintaining fusion conditions indefinately.ICF fusion will succeed in greatly improving the efficiency of the laser driver (the LLNL HAPLS laser delivered to ELI Beamlines Prague uses solid state laser pumping technology instead of traditional flash lamps and that change makes the HAPLS laser about 30% efficient at converting electricity into laser light). ICF fusion target gain will also greatly improve with the introduction of two-stage ICF targets capable of fusion energy gain in excess of 300X.Picture of a 2-stage high gain energy yield DT-DD “mini-Mike” fusion deviceMCF fusion will tend to run in short irregular power generating spurts and produce unreliable power, perhaps lesss dependable than renewable wind power, when first implemented in a commercial power plant form.ICF laser fusion power plants will on the other hand produce clean reliable power from the very first generation of power plants and will demonstrate a reliability and power availability characteristic similar to or better than current Gen-III fission nuclear power plants.Fusion and the need for humility -Huge amounts of incredibly skillful creative design and innovation have been lavished on the problems involved in bringing to reality practical forms of nuclear fusion. I do not think we are currently at a point to confidently select winners. I think we should resist pressures to consolidate all efforts to producing fusion to only the two mainstream fusion approaches, While my personal background is in ICF fusion as a part of LLNL Field Test - Engineering. I do not want pretend that I am sure that the commercial fusion future belongs to ICF fusion (and not MCF, Polywell, Dense Plasma Focus, or some other dark horse fusion technology).I trust ICF because I have repeatedly been a part of LLNL technical teams that have practically demonstrated using it to reliably on demand produce fusion power.This does not however rule out the chance that some other fusion technology has a breakthrough and becomes an alternate basis for future commercial fusion power plants.No one today sees clearly enough to make a really good timeline for commercial fusion power plants coming into existence.Excessive pesimism on the near term prospects of nuclear fusion isThe fusion quest can be successfully achieved in a time frame that matters.","220,634 followers",Franklin Veaux,3.2K,47.3K,783.1M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-fastest-speed-possible-in-space-using-an-ion-drive

A spark crosses the gap, making a magnetic field that compresses the plasma.Here are your variations on the concept:A.B.D.E.F.G.Magnetic Confinement:A. Tokamak:The major problem with looping plasma is the scattering effects. Material bounces off one another – most of the collisions not leading to fusion – and the scattering sends material into the wall. Different machines try to mitigate plasma scattering by shaping the magnetic geometry.B.C. Stellorator:D.D.F.Inertial Electrostatic ConfinementThis concept uses an electric field to heat ions to fusion conditions. The most basic IEC device is the fusor. This is how they work.A.Fusors are - by far and away - the simplest, cheapest, smallest and easiest to build fusion devices in the world – no contest. Teenage kids can build them for a few thousands of dollars in their garages. They can run for thousands of hours continuously. Over 75 amateurs in North America have fused the atom with these machines. We have had reports of amateurs reaching 1E11 neutrons per second on a 100 watts of power using a fusor.C.Other Approaches:A.B.D.

12,"The ITER plant in Southern France looks somewhat like a hollow donut in which a superheated plasma is contained by magnetic fields. Because the pressure inside the donut (us nerds call it a torus) can never be as high as inside the sun, the temperature must be much higher than in the core of the sun (!).To contain all this exceedingly hot plasma, you need magnetic fields of unbelievable strenght.The ITER plant in Southern France looks somewhat like a hollow donut in which a superheated plasma is contained by magnetic fields.

The only way to do so is to use supercooled magnets, which sit in a super insulated chamber all around the core.Thus, the chamber in which the magnetic coils sit must be cooled to only a few degrees above absolute zero. At the same time, we have the exceedingly high temperatures of 150 million degrees Celsius.It’s the best design available, but it is exceedingly difficult to build...","3,658 followers",Brent Oster,3.6K,357,1.8M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-fastest-speed-possible-in-space-using-an-ion-drive

14,"Probably not and the reason is pretty basic. So far the only devices humans have built that produce fusion energy in large quantities are nuclear weapons so lets count those out.The proposed fusion reactors plants that would be used to produce heat for electricity generations and other useful purposes are all pretty large in physical dimensions. In fact in terms of the reactor unit itself the common fission powered PWR electricity plants common world wide are very small compared to the massive magnetic confinement machinery needed for a plasma toroid design like the TOKAMAK being tested now.

In fact in terms of the reactor unit itself the common fission powered PWR electricity plants common world wide are very small compared to the massive magnetic confinement machinery needed for a plasma toroid design like the TOKAMAK being tested now. That is why you can fit a small fission reactor in a vessel like a submarine.This is a diagram of the ITER prototype which has so far only managed to very briefly generate 0.33% of the energy it consumes to operate. It is highly probable that to come any closer to generating more energy than it consumes to power itself the final unit will have to be several times larger just to break even and supply its own power demands.That final design is still just paper studies and speculation and this is a device humans have been working to build since the 1950’s when the first fusion bombs proved humans could make fusion happen outside of stars.I could be simplistic and say something silly like if this design produces 0.33% of the input energy the final design will have to be at least 3 times as large but in the real world physics doesn’t work like that. If it did work like that an SUV would be twice as fuel efficient as a compact car and we all know that isn’t true.If it turns out we can make a fusion reactor that produces more energy than it consumes and if that reactor is small enough we can afford the construction cost and if we can figure out how to deal with the extreme neutron radiation it produces while operating and if we can convince people it is worth all the effort when we already have green energy sources like hydroelectricity, geothermal, fission, wind ans solar then maybe fusion can be a silver bullet for all our energy problems.That is a lot of if-then statements, when any of those fails to be true the whole chain of logic breaks down.","3,658 followers",Brent Oster,3.6K,357,1.8M,2022,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-fastest-speed-possible-in-space-using-an-ion-drive
15,"Pretty much. Wind and solar are all ultimately powered by that big nuclear fusion reactor that rises in the East every morning. The sun also ultimately powers hydro-electricity.When we humans have electrified almost everything and get almost all our electricity from renewables, solar fusion will be the ultimate source.Terrestrial fusion is the longest of the very-long-odds wagers for people who cannot think of any better thing to do with their money.

But I’m far less confident that it can be done cheaply enough to be a commercial success.Q: Is fusion energy considered a silver bullet for all our energy needs?","220,634 followers",Franklin Veaux,1.6K,47.3K,783.1M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-fastest-speed-possible-in-space-using-an-ion-drive
