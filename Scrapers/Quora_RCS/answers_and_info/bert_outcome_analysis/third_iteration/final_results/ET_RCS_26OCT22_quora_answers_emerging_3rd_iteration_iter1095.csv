5,"I find it hard to believe. I’ve used Snowflake and there is no doubt that what it does is good and useful but the product is limited in scope compared to other tech companies. It makes them susceptible to having it replicated by others and then them being outcompeted. Snowflake is a scalable data analytics platform that is useful for OLAP work.The other large cloud providers offer ways of doing this but not in the same package exactly. If you look hereYou can see other larger cloud providers don’t offer the same things but could quickly catch up. Reading the story noteSnowflake’s ultimate goalI find it hard to believe.

If you look hereYou can see other larger cloud providers don’t offer the same things but could quickly catch up. Reading the story noteSnowflake’s ultimate goal is to achieve scale where it can monetize the collective network effect of its users. As the firm gathers more users, more data is made available to everyone in the Snowflake network. If Snowflake gathers a critical mass of data within its network, then the value of the data can draw even more users to its service. However, network effects are diminished in an ever-connected world because it is very difficult to maintain proprietary data advantages when so many users can access data from multiple services, locations, and in many forms.Given the strength and resources of Snowflake’s competition,Further complicating Snowflake’s efforts is its reliance on Microsoft, Amazon, and Google’s public clouds.Snowflake works on cloud service providers so they don’t have their own proprietary servers for this which seems realistic but also means they are reliant on them.When I used Snowflake it dramatically improved query performance but there isn’t really any secret sauce in that which other people probably can’t figure out. It also says they have diminishing revenue growth. The other companies can out spend them in R&D and they are contractually bound to them for their cloud usage.It’s hard to see them being the next big tech stock. I feel like the end game would be them getting acquired or them merging with Amazon and it being integrated into their AWS platform.Info",6 followers,Ryan Burner,1.6K,0,0,2021,https://www.quora.com/Quickly-list-the-10-biggest-trends-in-technology-in-the-next-10-minutes
