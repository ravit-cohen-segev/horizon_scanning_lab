1,"What do you mean by ""built for""?  You have it backward. Humans invented technology.

2,"Humans are very likely evolving faster today than at almost any time in the past. Sounds crazy, right? How could this be? Let me explain.Most people think of evolution as operating on members of a species with “inferior” traits, thereby reducing their survivability and ultimate contribution to the gene pool. With this understanding, you’d then point to our modern longevity and note that “humans have largely solved the problem of survivability” — which we have. We can remedy poor eyesight, compensate for chronic diseases, vaccinate against plagues, work around infertility, etc. But this understHumans are very likely evolving faster today than at almost any time in the past.

With this understanding, you’d then point to our modern longevity and note that “humans have largely solved the problem of survivability” — which we have. We can remedy poor eyesight, compensate for chronic diseases, vaccinate against plagues, work around infertility, etc. But this understanding is based on a narrow view of evolution.Evolution operates at a species wide level across vast periods of time. And what is it looking for? You might say, “survival of the fittest” or “natural selection”. And that’s where a lot of the confusion comes from. With ever longer lifespans and no natural predators, evolution seems to be way back in the rear view mirror for Homo sapiens. But what evolution really cares about isSo if we want to see if humans are evolving, we need to look for any signs ofSource:A Tale of Two Fertilities - Africa and Everywhere Else.

These have some great implications for the future of humanity. While some pose certain consequential repercussions, they are mostly evidences of how great the human mind is.The second –Yep, this didn’t really have to do with laziness as a consequence of innovation.

5,"We can be satisfied but not for long and this is how we are, we are highly developed animals with an un ending satisfaction level which is what drives us toward new discoveries or trying new food.If we look in general terms then yes I can be satisfied with my car or my home and not be constantly looking for a new one but if we zoom in we are bottomless pits.The moment I am full from eating I look for drink and when that is done I look to the television screen or whatever but we don’t sit staring at a wall for twenty four hours a day and if we did we would probably have at least a few thoughtsWe can be satisfied but not for long and this is how we are, we are highly developed animals with an un ending satisfaction level which is what drives us toward new discoveries or trying new food.If we look in general terms then yes I can be satisfied with my car or my home and not be constantly looking for a new one but if we zoom in we are bottomless pits.The moment I am full from eating I look for drink and when that is done I look to the television screen or whatever but we don’t sit staring at a wall for twenty four hours a day and if we did we would probably have at least a few thoughts about a friend to call or what to watch or snack on and it wouldn’t be long before we were searching for a higher fulfillment.In truth nothing in this world by itself will bring satisfaction but coming to the ultimate goal of coming to know natures laws and following them. This would be us going from being the child going to the store (world) and getting penny candy, to adults having the store in their hands and the key to the door.We tend to chase the penny candy because it is ready and easy to grab and thus we feel satisfied but only because we are consuming so many little tiny bites of life back to back that it feels full but mostly it is empty.True fulfillment and satisfaction comes from seeking the purpose of our existence which is to come to adhesion with the laws of nature which obligates us either willingly or forcefully to evolve and advance at every stage, second and millisecond of our existence.","5,990 followers",Jens Böttiger,566,2.6K,17.6M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Even-with-the-advanced-technology-humans-are-not-satisfied-Why-is-it-so
6,"Because they are working longer for lesser now.Because they are continuously being told that they are worthless - by their families, by the society, by recruiters.Because they spend their days working their ass off at their jobs, and their nights lying on their bed, scrolling through their Facebook feed, allowing a string of updates from people they barely know, about fancy dinners, exorbitant vacations, coveted jobs, ecstatic relationships, and unwanted gadgets, stir up their dormant envy like magma in a smoldering volcano, slowly chipping away at their fragile sense of self-worth.Because theBecause they are working longer for lesser now.Because they are continuously being told that they are worthless - by their families, by the society, by recruiters.Because they spend their days working their ass off at their jobs, and their nights lying on their bed, scrolling through their Facebook feed, allowing a string of updates from people they barely know, about fancy dinners, exorbitant vacations, coveted jobs, ecstatic relationships, and unwanted gadgets, stir up their dormant envy like magma in a smoldering volcano, slowly chipping away at their fragile sense of self-worth.Because they are told that 12 years of schooling isn’t sufficient and that they must get a degree. And 4 years later they are told that a mere ‘Bachelors’ would only fetch them a job serving coffee and making sandwiches, and that they must get a post graduate or a doctorate. And then they are told to be happy for having the opportunity to slave away one-third of their lives, barely eking out a living, and that if they persevere for a decade or two, they might get to come up to the ‘other side’. And then a few more years later, they are told that technology has progressed rapidly, at a pace they couldn’t possibly have matched, and that all they learnt can now be done at a fraction of the price by an automaton developed by a hot-shot kid at the world’s leading university, and here’s their severance check.Because people are fucking insatiable and would stop at nothing short of the entire universe.Because the media feeds them updates after updates about uber-exceptional folks - the man with 30 different degrees, the 25 year old CEO of a 200 billion dollar company, the 17 year old kid who made his first app and sold it to Yahoo for a cool 30 million, the athlete who was paid their entire annual salary for being on the field for just one minute, the actor who has slept with hundreds of Playboy models, lives in a mansion in Malibu, drinks like a sea-lion and snorts cocaine for breakfast.There are a whole bunch of “becauses” more. But none of them matter if only you decide to change the locus of control of your happiness. Change your benchmarks. Be realistic in your expectations. Compare yourself today with your self from yesterday. Realize that success and contentment aren’t the same.","5,360 followers",Valerio Cietto,677,2.4K,9.1M,2016,https://www.quora.com/Even-with-the-advanced-technology-humans-are-not-satisfied-Why-is-it-so
