Moreover, they have those damnSo that $500K isn’t much good to me, because it’s “dirty.” I need to have a good story to explain that $500K. Concocting that story, and fabricating the evidence to make that story believable, is money laundering.How does it work? Well, I won’t go into great detail for obvious reasons. But a typical scenario is to get into a (legitimate) cash business, and simply fabricate some transactions. I once read ananswer on Quora — I can’t remember who wrote it — that involved such a scheme.In that answer, the author was a young, small-time drug dealer, but who made enough money to need a cover story. So he literally posted some flyers around town for lawn mowing services.

1,No Technology That works reliable. There is one that you can put fingerprint in to fire for more than 1 person but always returned due to not always working. Battery and program like computer not always work or reboot while getting shot yourself.

Governments have Killed more people then ALL wars Combined. Nothing like being controlled and less safe criminals will have firearms with no technology.

2,"I would hardly consider Bangladesh to be an emerging economic power. In any case, they cannot and will not acquire “nuclear ballistic missile technology” because they are signatories of the non-proliferation treaty and have no conceivable reason to want or need nuclear weapons. They are incredibly expensive to develop and maintain. Bangladesh lacks the resources, expertise and money to obtain nuclear weapons let alone ballistic missiles and have even less need for those things.

Plus, the global economic sanctions that Bangladesh would face if the tried to build nuclear weapons would put an end to any dream of becoming an “emerging economic power.”",1 follower,Kevin Thorpe,831,18.8K,39.8M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-evolving-threats-of-money-laundering-supported-by-the-emerging-technologies-that-need-to-be-addressed-with-the-equally-advanced-anti-money-laundering-mechanism
3,"Typically, nations develop these technologies themselves, rather than acquire them from others. This is especially true of nuclear weapons, while ballistic missile technology is a bit easier to acquire from allies.Countries have rarely helped aspiring nuclear powers with nuclear weapons development. One exception is that France helped Israel early on in its nuclear program in the 1960s. Pakistan and India appear to have developed their weapons on their own.For Bangladesh to develop and deploy nuclear weapons would probably require international approval.

One exception is that France helped Israel early on in its nuclear program in the 1960s. Pakistan and India appear to have developed their weapons on their own.For Bangladesh to develop and deploy nuclear weapons would probably require international approval. They wouldn't be able to get the fissile materials or breeder reactor infrastructure without such approval and assistance. This would probably require a context where Bangladesh could make a strong case for needing nuclear weapons, and for its trustworthiness and competence in being able to manage and secure such weapons. It doesn't seem like Bangladesh could make such a case right now, and thus there won't be any allies willing to help them become a nuclear power. The world isn't generally receptive to new nuclear powers at this point in history, and it's not clear how Bangladesh would be a compelling exception.Contrary to the other answers, nuclear weapons are not very expensive, not compared to defense budgets overall. They're not anywhere near the bulk of the US defense budget, for example. And they're not expensive to maintain. People are just making stuff up without any actual knowledge. Typically, a country will field a few dozen missiles of a given type and they're done, very unlike the neverending procurement of things like fighter jets, ships, tanks, submarines, radar, SAMs, etc. All that stuff is more expensive than a nuclear arsenal.",0 followers,Naman Chakraborty,3.7K,342,36.6M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Are-there-any-emerging-weapon-technologies-that-would-require-Arms-Control-treaties-at-some-point
4,"Sort of.There are specific techniques which have been lost and we can’t reproduce. However, there’s usually one of two causes behind those. Some we can’t reproduce because they depend on a raw material we can’t get any more, usually because it’s gone extinct. We can’t make “Roman purple” because the species of murex shell used for it is gone, nor can we evaluate the effectiveness of some classical concoctions used for birth control because their active ingredient, an herb called silphium, is likewise no longer available.Then there are things where we can more or less produce the same or a muchSort of.There are specific techniques which have been lost and we can’t reproduce.
