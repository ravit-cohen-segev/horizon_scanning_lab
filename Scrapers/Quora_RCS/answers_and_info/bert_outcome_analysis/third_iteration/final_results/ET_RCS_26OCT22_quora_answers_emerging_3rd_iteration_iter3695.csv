He woke up one morning with a sore throat and his doctor over bled him. Native people have been using actual medicine for thousands of years.When the Europeans unintentionally brought malaria-laden mosquitos over to South America in the holds of their ships, the Aboriginal people immediately developed a cure for malaria. They used quinine, which is still in use today. Quinine alone saved millions upon millions of lives worldwide.Most medicines today have their roots in Native American medicine. One of the most famous is aspirin. First Nations people taught Europeans how to cure and prevent scurvy. Europeans were taught medicine by the Aboriginal people and wrote it down, and thus ‘discovered’ it.Hunting, camouflage and animal calls, animals scents to draw in the preyRubber, and amalgamized rubberForest management especially sustainable burning for the protection of communitiesCotton clothing, advanced colorsPetroleum jelly3000 varieties of potatoes, and almost as many varieties of corn, (squash, beans, peppers) causing a population boom in Europe as they gained access to the higher nutrient value; this even caused a change in the balance of world powers, a shift from the Mediterranean countries, to Great Britain, Germany, and the Soviet Union, the rise of these countries would not have been possible without the New World nutrition and technology‘Modern’ grid pattern for cities and towns. Roman and ancient Greek cities used the grid pattern, but European cities and towns didn’t use it, though there were notable exceptions. When the Europeans settled in America, they used the grid pattern the Native Americans used, as they settled on the townships and cities of the ‘ousted’ Native people. It became the new standard in this ‘new’ land. The common European design layout of cities and towns were rarer in America.The following were used about 1000 years before Europeans, and about 600 years before the Mediterranean countries: ‘zero’, advanced mathematics, astronomy, ‘farmers almanac’, anesthesia for surgery.Some of my other answers are more detailed, but I’m trying to not let my answers get too long and boring. I’m guilty of writing a little too much, sometimes!Update: I can’t believe I put ‘astrology’ instead of ‘astronomy’, lol, it was late by the time I got everyone to bed and I was already exhausted so I didn’t notice, but I fixed it! Ancient South Americans mapped the stars to an incredible level that it took a very long time for the European and Mediterranean countries to catch up to!The potatoes were cultivated more than 4,000 years ago on the Andes mountains. Archeologists found hundreds upon hundreds of little plots of land all over the mountain range. These plots of land were arranged in such a way that they were used to develop crops of potatoes at different heights, different needs for sun, different needs for water, different soils, etc. The Andes mountains contain tropical zones, dry zones, and wet zones. The ancient South American Native people used all the factors you can think of to develop different types of potatoes. Today they grow over 3,800 different types of potatoes, while the US only grows 250 different varieties today.When the Europeans came over, they chose the kinds of potatoes that would grow best in their home countries; Ireland, for example, became most notable for their potatoes, and potatoes enabled people to survive the threat of starvation during the World Wars. My adopted Dutch ‘Opa’ told us stories of the war, and I remember the great respect he had for the humble potato. He tried to teach us how to peel a potato so thin that when you took the peel and bent it between your fingers it wouldn’t ‘snap’. I’m sure many of you who had family in Europe during the war have similar family stories.Corn was developed in like fashion. There was corn that would grow best in desert-like conditions; these were developed to have a much shorter stalk, than corn that is grown in better water and soil conditions. The ancient South American people valued variety. Potatoes and corn came in many different colors, some were developed for fodder, but most were for human consumption. Perhaps this development of the potato and corn enabled and sustained those huge ancient empires we learn about in our history books!Long strand cotton grew in the Americas. In Europe, only short strand cotton was accessible, from India and the Near East, and was only good to be used as padding for chain mail. Long strand cotton from the Americas grew as much as 2 1/2 inches long and could be woven into cloth. After having everything, even your underwear spun from wool it must have been a nice change! Of course, if you were a rich noble, your clothing was woven of silk or linen.There I go again, rambling on and on when I said I wouldn’t, lol, but ancient American history and Native history is so exciting, and undervalued, and quite frankly, not accurately taught. We really aren’t motivated to learn the truth. As European descendants ( I am half First Nations and half European so I owe a debt to each), we are so much more comfortable believing that we came to the Americas, and ‘civilized’ them! I’ve even seen such ridiculous comments as ‘they are lucky we came along to save the Native people from each other. They would have killed each other off’. There’s a lot of denial regarding murderous European history; the millions upon millions murdered by the Germans and the Japanese during the ‘Wars’, or the million of Irish poor starved to death by their own Nobility, when they could have rerouted food to their own people. We warred with each other like every other nation in the world. We weren’t perfect, just like every other nation in the world, and just like every other nation in the world, we have our own contributions to technology and the advancement of humankind.",0 followers,Claire Jordan,970,45.6K,295.5M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Did-Native-Americans-have-any-advanced-technology-when-Europeans-first-arrived-on-their-shores-If-so-why-didn-t-they-develop-more-advanced-technology-than-they-had-e-g-wheeled-carts

6,"The answer is WE DEFINITELY HAVE NO IDEA ABOUT ANYTHING PERTAINING TO ALIENS. truth is we know nothing about aliens and never will because they are too far (if they exist). The only thing we can statisticly conclude is that there is a high likelihood that they exist because we calculate there are 100 billion galaxies and each galaxy has 100 billion stars, so they likely exist.

In 2020, about a quarter of global chips were produced in China, and more than half were imported into China for the fabrication into various electronic products being exported to the international markets. The chip application industry is not scattered around the world, but concentrated in China, where the industrial miracle has occurred. The scale of China's imported chips is so large that it has become a major market player, which has a protective effect and can also restrict the actions of the United States. China's chip application industry accounts for 70% of the world's, which is a completely different logic.The opportunity for domestic equipment to enter the industrial chain is progress. It is not that China does not have the ability to develop chip manufacturing. Related technologies have always been supported by special national funds, but they have not entered the production process on a large scale as a technical reserve. In the past, Chinese companies used US-based chips and technology systems to ensure technological competitiveness in important markets. This is also a common practice among global companies.However, the suppression of the United States has caused the logic of the chip industry to change. The new logic is that the market is no longer a cost decision but begins to consider the issue of survival. Independent technology will gain unprecedented momentum, and related companies will take the initiative to adjust the chip technology system in order to survive.At present, domestic equipment has initially had the foundation for independent development. For example, Hua Hong Group and SMIC's future equipment localization rate will inevitably increase gradually. It should be pointed out that although the domestic replacement of chip manufacturing equipment is intensifying.China is planning to rapidly increase chip production capacity, which is expected to double within a few years. The global chip industry is very eager for the Chinese market, and the opportunity for cooperation will not disappear due to the containment of the United States. Before 2025, the rapid development of independent chip manufacturing technology has made up for shortcomings and import substitution has continued to advance. At this stage, domestic equipment will strive to cut into the production line and gain substantial equipment market share. After the technical capabilities of domestic equipment have been proved, imported equipment can also be more smoothly.After the first stage of technology accumulation, in the field of the mature 28nm process production, China will strive to form a closed-loop independent industrial chain of R&D, manufacturing and sales. After 2025, even if the modern advanced manufacturing equipment cannot be imported, China's capacity expansion can be guaranteed. At that time, China's chip industry will usher in a historic turning point.After China opens up the industrial chain, it can usually achieve a sharp increase in efficiency, such as a substantial reduction in the construction cycle, construction costs, and equipment costs, and a substantial increase in production efficiency. Chip production will be redefined by China like many other industries. China will not only be the main body of...",20 followers,Paul Mitchell,501,7K,10.7M,2022,https://www.quora.com/How-much-longer-can-I-enjoy-my-organic-biological-self-before-the-advanced-technology-forces-me-to-evolve-into-a-robot-or-cyborg

Then they will worship you as a god.Don’t take it from me. Take it from Gotō Shinpei, a Japanese statesman and 4th governor of Japanese-occupied Taiwan.Shinpei had a keen interest in Taiwanese society. He traveled across the island to study their culture, but by the end of his journey, he became increasingly dismissive towards its people.“畏威不懷德” (i.e. cower before authority and strength, but incapable of camaraderie or virtue) was his conclusion.The legendary Taiwanese author Li Ao hadYou can see this trait in the Taiwanese mentality even today. Few people on earth worship Japan as the Taiwanese do, despite the fact that the Japanese were extremely brutal colonisers, and committed acts of genocide on the island long before the rise of Militarism. Imagine if Israel celebrates the Holocaust and marks 1 September as a national holiday.Meanwhile, the Taiwanese are hostile to mainland China, both its people and its government, despite the fact that the PRC buys most of their products, and gives their businesses and factories preferential treatment.There are other examples like this. When the PRC evacuated its citizens in Nepal due to the 2015 earthquake, Taiwanese people hitched a ride by declaring they were Chinese. But as soon as the plane landed, they were suddenly no longer Chinese, and opposed to everything the PRC stands for.A good parallel of this is the way Japan idolises the Americans for kicking their arses in World War II. Ironically, Shinpei’s assessment of the Taiwanese is equally true in regards to his own people, the Japanese - conniving, heartless, cowardly and servile.And before y’all get mad at me, know that I believe everything I just said applies to my own people, the Hong Kongers, as well.We absolutely worship the British, who governed us with an iron fist. We want football to “come home” more than the English themselves do. In every field from economic planning to worldviews, we are just as short-sighted, slimy, petty and pathetic, operating on base emotions and instincts like sewer rats or stray dogs - except some stray dogs are actually capable of expressing gratitude when being fed, instead of biting the hand that feeds them.See:",6 followers,Aaron Cai,682,1.7K,2.2M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Did-Native-Americans-have-any-advanced-technology-when-Europeans-first-arrived-on-their-shores-If-so-why-didn-t-they-develop-more-advanced-technology-than-they-had-e-g-wheeled-carts
