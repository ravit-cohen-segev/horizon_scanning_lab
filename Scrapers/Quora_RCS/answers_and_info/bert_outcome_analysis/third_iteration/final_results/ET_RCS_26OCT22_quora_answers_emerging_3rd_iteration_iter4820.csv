That’s a lot of money … but it hasn’t been spent on stealth technology.Although the Department of Defense’s overall spending on research, development, testing, and evaluation would grow 2.6 percent to $71.8 billion under the President’s fiscal year 2017 budget request, spending on the Science and Technology Program would decrease by 4.1 percent to $12.5 billion.The US develops new technologies in the Science & Technology program. Stealth technologies were likely developed in this budget. So, even if stealth technology consumed all of this budget, it would take 80 years just to spend one trillion dollars.Once the technology is developed, it costs a lot less to actually apply it. I worked on a proposal for a stealthy patrol craft. The overall budget was probably less than $10M, and the stealth profile had already been developed and modeled.However, this question is really about the effectiveness of stealth design, and development of effective radar systems to counter the stealthiness.Effectiveness of stealth technologyScenario one: My non-stealth destroyer is tasked to approach an enemy shore to support an insertion team. The enemy launches a bunch of anti-ship missiles. I deploy countermeasures, including chaff and ECM, and commence engaging with SAMs and close-in weapons. One of the missiles gets through, hits midships, kills a bunch of sailors and puts me out of action.Scenario two: Same situation, but with a stealthy destroyer. Enemy radar is picking up contact, but having difficulty discerning destroyer from other small boats in area (Zumwalt-class destroyers reportedly have the RCS of a small fishing boat. Multiple missiles launched, etc., but this time some missiles fail to acquire the target, and others target other small boats in the vicinity. Result … destroyer survives with no hits.(Aircraft scenario is similar - just easier to describe with a ship. I have read reports that it is difficult to achieve radar lock on an F-22).Counter-stealth radarsStealth aircraft are not invulnerable to radar detection. However, there are a number of factors to consider.Stealthy fighter aircraft (such as the F-35) are generally vulnerable to low-band radars (for example VHF-band radars). However, due to their large wavelength (and associated antenna size), low-band radars are not practical for airborne use. Furthermore, their relatively low resolution is not suitable for tracking and fire control. Therefore, they are best suited for early warning and/or cuing of other sensors and platforms.The situation is even worse for large stealth aircraft (such as the B-2), and Very Low Observable Aircraft (such as the F-22) which are more difficult to detect with low-band radars.SummaryThe development of stealth technology was less about cost, and more about knowledge acquisition.Stealth technology can help reduce detection and acquisition.Counter-stealth radar technologies exist, but have severe limitations.",187 followers,Abhirup Sengupta,677,571,9.2M,2017,https://www.quora.com/USA-is-spending-trillions-of-dollars-on-stealth-technology-What-if-a-country-makes-a-radar-to-detect-the-stealthiness

People who are engaged in marketing and policy regulators strive to maintain the code of ethics and social aspects of marketing, including marketing for children's products.• Consumer BehaviorConsumer behavior can be defined as actions taken by individuals, groups or organizations in acquiring, consuming, and consuming goods and services to meet their needs, and the influence of this process for consumers and society.Knowledge of consumer behavior can be applied in the following cases:All marketing strategies and tactics are designed based on explicit or implicit beliefs about consumer behavior. Decisions made based on clear assumptions, existing theories, and more proven research are successful compared to decisions taken based solely on guesswork or intuition. So knowledge about consumer behavior is more profitable. This can reduce incongruity in market decisions and failures.• Regulatory PolicyPolicies are designed to build, translate, and implement regulations that are made as protection and assistance for consumers• Social MarketingSocial marketing is used to change or create equipment that has a positive effect on the target individually and the wider community. Social marketing is usually used to campaign for efforts to reduce smoking, immunize children, campaign for the dangers of AIDS, the dangers of drugs and other things that are very important and related to the wider community.• Informed IndividualsPeople living in developing countries, in general, are consumptive people. Most people in this community use more time for consumption activities than other activities, including sleep and work. So that knowledge of consumer behavior can increase our understanding of the environment and ourselves. This understanding is useful for residents, forming effective buying behavior and business considerations.Hope the explanation helps,OKportal Technology",175 followers,Sanya Malhotra,701,0,0,2019,https://www.quora.com/USA-is-spending-trillions-of-dollars-on-stealth-technology-What-if-a-country-makes-a-radar-to-detect-the-stealthiness

6,"Let's first if all agree that slavery was an evil and if it was good then to us all. Slave trade only benefited few individual investments but not huge economic advances.Elliott Cairnes, an economist, reckoned that slavery stifled economic growth in the South. Cairnes argued that reluctant workers depleted soils more quickly. In addition, scientific agriculture was impossible. Reluctant slaves, with little interest in learning, had no interest in using new farming techniques. And this meant that Southern farms lost competitiveness to their Northern counterparts.Others reckon that slavery madeLet's first if all agree that slavery was an evil and if it was good then to us all. Slave trade only benefited few individual investments but not huge economic advances.Elliott Cairnes, an economist, reckoned that slavery stifled economic growth in the South. Cairnes argued that reluctant workers depleted soils more quickly. In addition, scientific agriculture was impossible. Reluctant slaves, with little interest in learning, had no interest in using new farming techniques. And this meant that Southern farms lost competitiveness to their Northern counterparts.Others reckon that slavery made it difficult for the South to establish trading networks. According to Ralph Anderson and Robert Gallman, slavery forced planters to diversify their economic activities. The costs of owning a slave—such as food and shelter—were pretty constant. And so if plantations specialised in a certain crop, they left themselves open to sudden drops in income and consequently big losses. But by pursuing a range of economic activities, they had a steadier revenue flow to match their fixed costs.Diversification posed problems. Messrs Anderson and Gallman argue that it inhibited trade within the South—and, consequently, the development of towns and villages. Slaveowners found it easier to produce something themselves, rather than buy it. And the South found it difficult to develop a manufacturing industry—instead, it depended on imports from the North. As a result, economic growth was stifled.Slavery hindered the development of Southern capitalism in other ways. Eugene Genovese, writing in 1961, reckoned that the antebellum South was not profit-seeking. In fact, slavery was not even meant to be profitable. Slaveowners were keener on flaunting their vast plantations and huge reserves of slaves than they were about profits and investment. Rational economic decisions were sacrificed for pomp and circumstance.Economies which used slavery may, in the long run, have been at a disadvantage. Some analyses suggest that the economic contradictions of slavery led to its inevitable demise. But slavery had indirect effects on other economies. Douglass North, a Nobel-Prize-winning economist, argued that the expansion of Southern plantation slavery was at the centre of midwestern economic development in the nineteenth century (though the South's demand for certain foodstuffs).And other research looks at slavery's effects on economies outside America. James Walvin reckoned that provincial banking emerged in the eighteenth century because of the need for credit in the long-distance Atlantic slave trade. And according to Eric Williams, although slavery stifled Caribbean economic growth, it encouraged global commodity circulation—a major precondition for the British industrialisation in the late eighteenth century. He also thought that slave profits were important to financing the infrastructure projects, like railways, that powered the industrial revolution.Of course any account of the economic effect of slavery should note the effect of treating human beings as capital equipment. The direct impact on the utility of the slaves themselves of this condition represented a terrible economic cost. And there was also an opportunity cost to the broader economy, which lost out on the potential human capital and entrepreneurial contributions slaves might have made as free workers. Abolition of involuntary servitude to say nothing of chattel slavery, was clearly a moral imperative. We can also feel pretty safe concluding that, whatever the benefit of the system to slave-owners, its abolition made as much economic sense as anything can.Suggested reading list:Anderson, R.

It was so deeply part of their DNA that they could not separate themselves from the ideology. After all: how many abolition groups sprung up in the South?Slavery: it was always about the money.Technology and slavery.Eli Whitney painting by Samuel F. B. Morse.Eli Whitney‘s cotton gin increased the need for slaves rather than reducing it. Before Whitney‘s invention, there are sources that assert that the return on investment on slaves was marginal. The effectiveness of the cotton gin supported by slave labor changed this. The value of cotton as a cash crop grew astronomically in the decades following Whitney’s patent going into effect. By some estimates, the United States supplied three-quarters of the global cotton supply by the start of the Civil War. All technology did was make slaves more valuable.Early version of the cotton ginThe South also adopted the steam engine, mainly to aid the cotton gin and to use on steamships to transport cotton. Again, the technology made slavery more profitable.There are also many lesser but numerous technological innovations that came about as a result of the industrial revolution; but, none had any impact on reducing the need for slaves.It’s possible to identify technologies in the 20th century that eliminated jobs and hurt poor blacks in the South; but, it would take a much longer write-up to analyze and assess whether these technologies would have ended slavery if there had never been a war. My perception is that it would have only reduced the number of slaves and not eliminated it. And, any slaves that for whatever reason were no longer in direct bondage would have been relegated to a level of apartheid equally as bad as slavery.","5,990 followers",Jens Böttiger,566,2.6K,17.6M,2021,https://www.quora.com/How-does-digital-marketing-affect-consumer-behaviour

Technology barely kept slavery in business, combined with the British East India Corporation taking a monopoly on indigo, cotton, and rice. Ohio farmers using free techniques were a much better investment than slave farms, so much so that they could make money off of commodity crops.The problem is that technology allowed a small number of very rich people to stay afloat while devastating the common working person - who by law was also the provider of 90% of the taxes in Southern states, and mostly lacked the right to vote because slave owners smugly said that they were republics who did not need all that democracy that was opening up northern polities to less and less corrupt government.Corrupt, vastly poor, lacking most innovations, with an economy owned by foreign nations, the Confederate states were no better than Beys for the Mughal Kingdoms, in that when the UK said grab your cheeks and get ready for daddy, the proud Southern gentleman bent over and did what he was told. In fact by the 1850s common southern talk was in a war with the UK, would the Southern Gentleman fight for Queen or president. In the presence of such talk some years before Andrew Jackson offered to whip individually or in large groups the traitorous slave owners. The author of “Company Aytch”, a recount of the war, said that slave ownership sapped the manliness of the Southern gentleman class and made them no better than catamites for the highest paid lecher.So yes. If you are a scholar in 1920 and take the receipts of income from a Milledgeville plantation you can prove that, for a plantation, technology enabled slavery to stay above water. But if you are a scholar in 2020 you can instead compare what that plantation earned more hectare and per person and realize that it was getting like 1.45% ROI after technology, where a farmer in Findlay, Ohio with free labor and access to the same technology was making 4.55%, the big difference is that the Milledgeville plantation could only make 1.45% if it exceeded 6000 hectares, while the farmer in Findlay made 4.55% down to 75 hectares and was still profitable to 35 hectares.Old myths die real hard when they support a racist starting position, and even non-racists get caught up in the old textbook answers.The exact numbers on how less effective slave labor is from free is up in the air.","5,360 followers",Valerio Cietto,677,2.4K,9.1M,2021,https://www.quora.com/How-does-digital-marketing-affect-consumer-behaviour

Anyone who’s ever had to put on military grade camo creme will testify that it’sBut what if it’s just for training?Countless Korean men hate this stuff because it’s so difficult to wash off after training. It certainly doesn’t help that the sun bakes our skin during the day and so it’s really quite agonizing cometh night time.Innisfree recognized this need and made good camo creme that looked exactly the same but was easier to wash off with special soap. It also doubled as a sun block.So now we arrive at the second issue. Men are stupid and wouldn’t buy this stuff even though it makes perfect sense to do so. So how did Innisfree overcome this barrier? They didn’t have to.There is a long standing tradition of throwing a party for our male youngsters before they enter bootcamp. What follows is usually a set of gifts given by loved ones such as letters or practical items such as strong wrist watches.This product was very strategically important for the same reason Apple/Microsoft/Google want to get their operating systems into the hands of students even at an economic loss. The reason being that those kids will grow accustomed to their products andApplying this type of makeup is one of the first kinds that kids get to experience when young. But the fact that it’s an entry point is precisely the reason it’s so powerful. All cosmetics companies bundle different kinds of male cosmetics and don’t even worry about marketing it to men because it’s the women that buy them for men that primarily drive sales. As a by-product, men become conditioned into a default choice of cosmetics brand when and if they are in a position to choose.",330 followers,Sky Chon,883,87,691.4K,2017,https://www.quora.com/How-does-digital-marketing-affect-consumer-behaviour
