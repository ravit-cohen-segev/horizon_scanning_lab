Ooh! OOH!Something literary I can answerWells, in terms of readability, actually stands up very well against more modern authors. His prose is always well executed and though you do need a measure of understanding, he doesn’t baffle with obscurities or introduce hard concepts like Clarke did, nor invent magic technologies like still later writers.Currently I’m halfway through readingAnd for me that’s the beauty of Wells. He was fascinated byCertainly that last case was true with Leo Szilard (who admittedly was educated far above school leaving standard) who in 1932 read Wells’""Knowing what it would mean - and I knew because I had read HG Wells - I did not want this patent to become public.""Wells got another direct hit in 1933 when he wrote The Shape of Things to Come because although some things went a bit wide he was smack on the money about large scale aerial bombing, (as London, Coventry, Dresden, and Berlin would find out over the next twelve years) and predicted that submarines would be launch-pads for “air torpedoes” that were weapons of mass destruction. The first SLBM would be another twenty-two years, when the Soviet Union came up with the SS-N-4 Sark. (I don’t know if Stalin read Wells too).Back to the aerial bombardments and 1939 and Szilard finding out that Germany was stockpiling uranium, which caused him to help Einstein write a letter to Roosevelt which led to the Manhattan Project.Wells was in fact a biologist, earning his degree in Zoology, and contributing to the idea of an atomic bomb isn’t a bad record for a zoologist. Wells, unlike post-war writers, eschewed the idea of fantastic leaps forward and put what was plausible to application and keep it simple thereafter:He said after writing The Time Machine:""the more impossible the story I had to tell, the more ordinary must be the setting, and the circumstances in which I now set the Time Traveller were all that I could imagine of solid upper-class comforts.""Very modern writers find their medium in film and television today rather than in printed literature as Wells did. Whilst you can achieve stunning special effects in these media, sometimes it’s at the expense of the craft of the story. Star Wars: A New Hope (1977) is a very good romp but the Death Star is a ridiculous concept, particularly when it comes to blowing up a planet (where’s that energy coming from?) but really just for its size; it’s a moon. Take it anywhere near another celestial body and see what gravity does. And what stupid design firm can produce a technical marvel like this but forgets to put a bloody grille on the exhaust pipe? Don’t even get me started about how easy it is to get spaceships off the ground. They invent magical engines. Wells came up with a sheet of “Cavorite” to do it.To sum up, unlike modern writers, Wells was not primarily concerned with presenting magi-science or fantastic technologies, and stuck to the now. His craft is indisputable; he was a teacher, a journalist, and a social commentator (disguised in his works are many subtle commentaries on the English class system and his ever-developing socialist leanings) and this shows in his clear and yet strangely compelling prose.I’d rather read Wells than Asimov, and Dick rather than Clarke, and almost anything else than EE “Doc” Smith.",0 followers,Jim Hogarth,10.5K,94,5.5M,2019,https://www.quora.com/As-human-technology-has-evolved-over-time-how-has-sci-fi-authors-vocabulary-and-jargon-to-describe-future-technology-evolved-How-does-HG-Wells-descriptive-style-compare-with-Asimov-s-and-how-do-both-compare-with

4,"Yes, of course.As long as there is reproduction, there will be evolution.Every child born carries heritable characteristics from their parents whilst also introducing a few of their own, due to the fact that a child is never a direct clone of it’s parents.These heritable characteristics are then passed on to their offspring, combining with heritable characteristics from the second parent, plus new ones exclusive to this new offspring.And so on, and on, and on.It may well be that there is far less selection pressure on humans in a technological society, due to greater life expectancy and reprodYes, of course.As long as there is reproduction, there will be evolution.Every child born carries heritable characteristics from their parents whilst also introducing a few of their own, due to the fact that a child is never a direct clone of it’s parents.These heritable characteristics are then passed on to their offspring, combining with heritable characteristics from the second parent, plus new ones exclusive to this new offspring.And so on, and on, and on.It may well be that there is far less selection pressure on humans in a technological society, due to greater life expectancy and reproductive opportunity, but contrary to popular belief, this does not slow down or stop evolution. In fact, it can accelerate it!When a species finds itself under highly specific natural selection pressures, only a small number of genetic configurations will be advantageous. Therefore, there is a much narrower diversity of genetics.But in a technological society, natural selection plays less of a role, meaning far more diverse heritable traits can pass to the next generation and far more ‘mixing’ of these traits can occur over many generations.Remember, evolution is NOT a ladder. It is simply ‘change over time.’If more members of a population survive and reproduce, the result is greater diversity in their offspring, and the recombination of this greater diversity in subsequent generations leads to greater change per generation.","2,288 followers",Emmanuel Fabella,2.8K,434,3M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Are-humans-in-a-technological-society-still-evolving

But it is also likely that somewhere in our dispersed species, some individuals or group of individuals will have a mutation that makes them resistant to that biological threat. And since any new humans would result from that smaller group, that indeed would be an example of “natural selection” showing up in our evolution.There is no such thing as “good” evolution or “forward” evolution.

Then, since all the predators who would have eaten them are dead, they’ll be able to reproduce and fill they void. That’s how we got here. As small mammals our ancient ancestors were prey for almost every dinosaur, and so we remained in the shadows until the majority of life on earth was destroyed and our proto selves got a chance to get out from underground and expand to what we see today: the mammalian domination.If not for that asteroid, we’d all still just be little rodent like animals running through tunnels trying to not get eaten.","5,214 followers",Pepper Meister,3.3K,5K,17M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Are-humans-in-a-technological-society-still-evolving

It is a word used to describe the process of change and mutation to plants and animals to adapt to their environment so as to procreate and perpetuate. The ape known as human took many millions of years to evolve what we are now. The earliest mammals appear in the early Jurassic/late Triassic, therefore taking nearly 200 million years to become human in one branch of mammalia.It would seem our brains reached a point of growth at the same time as sudden (geologic sudden) environmental change in Africa. The tools and travel methods our ancestors used continued to push them in a direction that allowed for the growth size of the brain to get larger as a way to adapt to our environment.The brain uses a large amount of energy to do the thinking and problem solving parts, but as long as those thinking and solving problem processes work for survival, then the body will continually drive efforts forward to make the brain our survival method.To our knowledge, non-avian dinosaurs never needed to evolve a brain that complex, because there were no adaptations needed for a quickly changing environment. Despite how things are sometimes depicted, climate would remain steady and change very slowly over millions of years, punctuated by occasional periods of sudden change due to volcanism or even the occasional asteroid strike.

These will help them make it through the night, the winter, the aeons.Within the species, the one individual with the longest claws or the fastest legs has better chances to survive than its underprivileged siblings. Chances are that particular individual will live long enough to mate and have offspring and pass its privileged genes onto them. Repeat the process by thousands of generations and the claws get longer and longer, the polar bear has white fur, while its Grizzly cousin has brown.These skills and features are developed in response to environmental pressure and to the skillset of competitive species. The moose grows antlers, the wolves develop pack hunting. And through that balance they both survive.In other words, all these developed skills and features are likeTakeThen, one day (thankfully for us) came a huge meteorite impact - aNow here’sIn this new era different types of skillsets can also be relevant to survival of the species. Now, it’s not only about claws and fangs (they remain a favorite) but a certain mizerable primate with rather complex vocal chords and opposable thumbs suddenly has a chance. Of all its stronger primate cousins, that’s the one that eventually stands up and travels distances, again to adapt to environmental conditions. Its hand anatomy, originally developed to climb trees, helps it make tools and, most importantly, start a fire. Consequently, this guy and his friends lose the fur. Which in turn, frees up a lot of their time (see how primates spend most their day removing parasites from each other’s fur), not to mention rids them of bloodsuckers that tend to decrease one’s life expectancy. They gather round the fire every night and their vocal chords evolve even more. They communicate effectively and their hunting strategies become lethal against much larger animals. AndFunny thing is, had these weaklings started out stronger and better armed they probably wouldn’t have developed any of that, which in the end proved vastly superior to claws and fangs.And this is why dinos were around for about 160 million years yet they never built an iPad.","26,672 followers",Donna Fernstrom,773,9.3K,64.7M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Are-humans-in-a-technological-society-still-evolving
