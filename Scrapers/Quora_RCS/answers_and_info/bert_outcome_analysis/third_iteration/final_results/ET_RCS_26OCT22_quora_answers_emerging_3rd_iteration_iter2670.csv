6,"When J.K. Rowling first started writingWhen J.K. Rowling first started writingHere’s what we know for sure:That’s most of what we know concerning the basic rules of how magic works. Everything else I’ll say here is informed and carefully-considered headcanon, which I hope will fill in some of the gaps. You’re free to disagree with me, but I want to try to make up for Rowling’s inconsistencies:Rowling’s magic system pretends to be a hard magic system, but it’s not. It’s a soft magic system. Therefore, speaking from a Watsonian standpoint, wizards themselves don’t actually know that much about how magic works. The nature of magic is extremely mysterious (hence why there’s an entire department in the Ministry that’s devoted to studying it). The closer to the fundamental nature of existence magic gets, the more mysterious, unpredictable, and powerful its nature. That’s why magic involving Love, Death, and Time is so dangerous to mess with.Magic in general is dangerous, which is why the wand-incantation-gesture system of magic that we are all so familiar with wasThe Ministry of Magic both standardized and secularized magic. Religious influences in the folk spells of medieval “cunning” wizards were purged, and ceremonial magic was relegated as a hobby for eccentric old wizards with too much time on their hands and/or edgy teens. There are some exceptions — alchemy remained prestigious, and a bunch of eccentric wizards formed a secret society called the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn to continue to study ceremonial magic. But Hogwarts students will never be required to read Agrippa’s writings, and they probably only know John Dee from their chocolate frog cards. Honestly, that’s probably a good thing, because not everyone believes in spirits, and parents wouldn’t want their kids learning a magical practice that conflicts with their religious beliefs. (I guarantee that there are just as many wizard parents concerned about certain kinds of magic being “demonic” as there are Muggle fanatics concerned about their kids readingMagic is capable of much more beyond this standardized system. Wizards in different countries have different styles of magic. They may or may not use wands or other, similar tools, and their incantations (if they have them) are in all sorts of languages! (Though, it may be safe to assume that incantations are typically in more archaic languages or forms of languages; for example, Indian spells may be more often in Sanskrit than Hindi.) Spells from around the world will also be heavily influenced by those countries’ native traditions of folk magic, and by native religion.[The only thing this theory doesn’t explain is how a wizard can cast a spell without knowing what it does, as Harry successfully casts the Prince’s spells just by saying the incantation. Honestly, there’s no in-universe explanation for this one. It’s just an inconsistency. But I could certainly come up with a bunch of potential theories to explain it away: It’s possible that certain kinds of spells invented by particularly powerful wizards (like Snape) have inherent power that other kinds of spells don’t. It’s also possible that, if Harry said the incantation and intended forAs for Dark Magic, Dark Magic is a bit of an arbitrary distinction. That isn’t to say that Dark Magic doesn’t exist, but that it’s the extreme end of a spectrum, and it starts to tread into moral philosophy rather than simple mechanics.

New resources are found in the frontier enriching all. In this environment cooperation is favoured over competition, since cooperation brings more resources from the frontier into the center enriching us all.In the present age our frontier is interplanetary space, and beyond that, interstellar space. Interplanetary space is traverse by chemical rockets. The first large chemical rockets were developed in the 1940s and advanced continuously since. Investment in rocket technology reduces the cost of momentum delivered by rockets. This increases the mass flow per dollar between points where the change in speed is fixed to connect the two places. Thus development follows a well defined arc;At this point serious investment in lowering the cost of momentum delivered by rockets was abandoned. Project funding for atomic rockets was ended, and previously declassified materials were reclassified. Had funding and focus continued apace we would have hadThe founding of Space in 2002 resulted in a rocket with a reusable first stage. This dramatically cut the cost of space launch and allowed SpaceX to come to dominate space launch and earn significant profits doing so.It takes 52 days 16 hours to fly to Pluto at 1/10th gee using photonic thrusters.To perform interstellar trips requires vastly more energy. Yet, that energy is available from the Sun. The way we tap the sun’s energy at the scale needed is by creating an optical machine made of plasma. You see, the refractive index of hot plasmas changes with temperature. So, by projecting a pattern of laser light into the chromosphere to create an optical element that is capable of communicating, computing, generating controlled laser beams, and making copies of itself. So, taking an hour to replicate, projecting a single square meter of plasmonic structure into the sun it takes only 62.4 hours to cover the entire sun with an array of such machines, and capture 18% of the sun’s luminosity for human use. The entire sun may be considered a single optical element and thus can project similar patterns to nearby stars. Those stars signal back their status, and repeat the process, expanding outward. In this ways the interplanetary cyclers are upgraded to interstellar cycler operating at 1 gee. The sun boosts the photonic thruster at 1 gee to the half way point and light originating from the destination star slows the ship’s speed beyond that point. In this way humanity will be able to travel freely across the galaxy.All products and services diffuse into use in a well defined way.It is no different for interplanetary settlement or interstellar settlement. The interesting aspect it that population grows at 1.06% and even with unlimited life span, population wil grow at less than 2%. Innovators constitute 2.5% of the population, whilst Early adopters constitute 13.5%. So as soon as cost effective interplanetary travel and interstellar travel is available everyone will make use of it within 20 to 40 years, and the Earth will be depopulated, and later, the Solar System will be depopulated.Time Dilation and the Ultimate FrontierNow, after travelling 2.15 light years at 1 gee acceleration — half way to the nearest star — a ship attains 95.15% light speed slowing time aboard ship (and reproductive rate) by 3.25x. This distance is half way to the nearest star. Longer distances produce even higher speeds and higher dilations. Creating extreme dilations in time. This means that populations that are moving across the galaxy do not reproduce until they get to where they are going. Yet, the loss rate of ships scales with distance. At some point the loss at a given range equals the total births within the volume of the sphere with that range. Beyond that range, the number of humans fall off. Humans becoming increasingly rare beyond this range. Even if starships are safer than sitting in your living room, this will occur because of time dilation.This is the final condition of a technical species.

A more fitting analogy would be machinery in an automobile plant that not only made the parts one day, but then learned how to assemble them the week after, and then how to design cars a year later.I think that there is little that is out of reach for advanced AI of the future. Let's leave the question of the AI singularity alone for now. Instead, I think that deep learning efforts at Google and elsewhere are making AI systems learn faster and faster, with a growing rate of acceleration. Advanced AI can now address increasingly complex tasks including medical diagnosis, stock market trading, weather prediction and human behavioral modeling. Very soon, it will be able to take the place of certain types of teachers, and find a role in education. It can already deal with complex systems in software and mathematics, and seems to be only limited in applications that require interactions with the physical world (sensors are still imperfect), and with people.So without projecting too far into the future, we can ask the question, what jobs will NOT be killed by AI? Jobs that involve labor are already (or soon to be) replaced. Jobs that require logical reasoning are being replaced, albeit at a slower rate. What are the qualities that humans have that cannot be captured by AI? Perhaps creativity, emotional responses? So perhaps researchers in academia will survive longer than most, and artists (though AI stylistic mimicry is already quite impressive and their results enjoyable), and counselors/psychologists/case workers, and decision makers like CEOs who cannot be predictable or error prone. And hopefully software engineers and algorithm designers who develop AI systems.This leaves a very, very small portion of today's jobs intact. Many say: we just need to train people to fill higher level jobs created by AI, e.g. Programmers, ML researchers. But this is no easy feat. The US educational system is struggling to meet the demands created by advanced technology today. This failure is in part responsible for the economic divide plaguing the country today. The challenge of educating the public for a job market that is both decreasing in scope and increasing in complexity, is nothing we've ever faced before.I am far from original in this opinion. But if I had to guess, I would say that AI will put far more people out of work than we can (re)train in time. That will have significant economic repercussions as corporations seeking to minimize cost will do so at the cost of rising unemployment. There will need to be dramatic changes in social policies in order to avert large scale economic disaster, first dramatic rises in minimum wage, then eventually some type of universal income/welfare. It's the kind of change that requires significant leadership in our government, something that seems woefully absent today.","5,360 followers",Valerio Cietto,677,2.4K,9.1M,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-most-advanced-technology-in-the-Harry-Potter-Universe

Yes, we convert Energy into Power by ”boiling the water,“ which has a low energy conversion rate. Today's principle of nuclear fission reactor power generation is not fundamentally different from steam engines hundreds of years ago! Regardless of the current thermal power or nuclear power, it is heating water: heat converts water into steam, and the steam drives the turbine to generate electricity. (Note: The conversion rate of nuclear fission we use today is only 0.135%)It is most likely that human beings will not be able to ""go out"" the solar system, and even be ""trapped"" to die on earth!The nuclear fusion conversion rate is 0.7%. If nuclear fusion power generation is realized, it may alleviate the current energy crisis. It is not enough for interstellar flight. (Note: As science fiction says that ""Positive and Anti-Matter Annihilation"" is the most efficient, can achieve 100% quality conversion, can help us fly out of the solar system. )Realistically, if we fail to master the controllable nuclear fusion before depleting fossil energy, it is not only ""Civilization Retrogression,"" but the entire human sci and tech civilization will be ""locked out"" until we die. Because in those days we will be unable to ""organize higher-scale industrialization"" and not be able to further test our scientific theory.Human beings are powerless and insignificant. Think of Traveler 1, the man-made object farthest from the Earth, and the fastest man-made object. It takes 40,000 years to fly to the AC+79 3888 star of Ophiuchus. It takes 73,600 to fly to Proxima Centauri of Centaur. The interstellar voyage for it is just a simple fantastic lies. How negligible us? Please be humble~As for interstellar travel, if the person who does not wear the spacesuit leaves the surface layer, just like ""The deep sea fish leave the deep sea will detonate himself"", yes, in any other environment, the human body will be vulnerable to ""cannot withstand even a single blow"". Hey, we humans are the creatures born in the surface environment. We are destined to be inseparable from such environment, and it is even more difficult to cross the ""space measured by light years."" The earth is the cradle of humankind and it will surely be our destination and cemetery.Almost all of the Earthian is still bound by gravity, and it is difficult to fly out of it.Humans used to go to the moon with ""The primeval Chemical Rocket,"" but never went to Mars. Most people are trapped in the earth's tiny plot of land, let alone the universe.Although we can now ""observe dozens of billions of light years of the universe"", no matter how influential bigwigs can't leave the earth. They can only be like the common people who feet can't leave the ground. Exhausting the limits of the power of human tech can barely enough landing on the moon, its number can be counted on the fingers of one hand.The natural resources in the universe are inexhaustible, but we can only divide into some hostile factions, scheme against each other, intrigued, mutual suspicion, resorting to deception… excessive competition for such a little bit of unremarkable resource on earth. The human civilization at this stage is still too primitive.I really want to ""strive for the cause of human civilization in the universe all my lifetime"", but now I can only ""work for the sake of making a living and fortune"", such a life is not reconciled.We even have not been able to explore the earth.In terms of crustal exploration, the deepest borehole that our drilled has just reached more than 10,000 meters depth. Our drill bit with difficulty went to the bottom of the crust for humans and took a look at the edge of the mantle. This depth is only equivalent to ""The worm takes a bite of apple peel."" This is why we cannot predict earthquakes because even the ""normal state"" of the crust can only be inferred by indirect evidence, and the judgment of its ""abnormal state"" is even more unreliable.…SummaryIt seems that some of today inventions of ""redoubtable and formidable"" are mostly the advancement of Applied Science, not the progress of Basic Science. The development of personal computers is only consistently integrated and shrinking smaller, supercomputers are always stacking and piled up, naturally, their computing performance is strengthened…But quantitative change is unlikely to trigger a qualitative change. It won't bring us quantum computers.The so-called ""innovative tide and creative spoondrift"" is just something ""in application-level."" Basic theory has been stagnant for a long time, and superstring theory has not progressed for many years. In any case, ""Basic Theory"" is the ""source power"" of human sci and tech development. Tomorrow, we may have some room for growth in the application of tech, but the development of the ""fundamental power"" has not been reformed for a long time!Chier Hu's answer to Has fundamental physics stagnated?Chier Hu's answer to Do you think our technology is primitive?Chier Hu's answer to Why is medical technology so primitive compared to computer technology?Chier Hu's answer to What are some examples showing how underdeveloped or powerless present-day human technology is?",78 followers,Rajan Singh,1.5K,360,25.2M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-most-advanced-technology-in-the-Harry-Potter-Universe

It’s largely religious and political institutions that are the worst laggards, along with the cultural and economic forces that underpin them.It might seem like we’re having trouble coping today, but the previous five centuries were much, much worse.
