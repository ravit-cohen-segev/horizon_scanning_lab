It seems everyone with a voice and a working knowledge of flash animation has written a song about the solar system. We've watched lots of these songs over the last few days and my son can now name all the planets and even knows some information about each one. Did you know Uranus rotates differently to the other planets, as if it was lying on its side? I didn't. My four year old does.I know knowledge isn't wisdom but this experience has taught him some new information. And it's also taught him that curiosity is rewarded. He was curious and he knew we could not only find him some information immediately, we could find him information that was presented in a fun and engaging way that he wanted to watch multiple times.His older cousins are more interested in playing minecraft than watching TV.

They never invented the wheel! … and before you think “wow, they’re dumb!” you should probably step back and look at things from their perspective, since pretty much zero percent of the land they needed to cross quickly was flat. They never invented “the wheel” because wheels would’ve been just about useless to them.

To sail across an ocean safely you need three inventions:These three things took awhile to get together, not least because number 2 is so devilishly hard to accomplish (without atomic decay and without electricity) that it required a level of precision machining that was pretty damn hard to come by until robots.… which also meant that clocks good enough for the purpose were… which meant many sailors did without them, using complicated math and the moon instead.Know what else is bloody brilliant? Let’s go back further. Much further. Let’s talk about this:Do you recognize that? I mean it’s beautiful. Take a guess. Try to think “what is that thing…”.Nope, it wasn’t for smoking weed, though the history of smoking is itself a glorious scientific journey.That is anI can’t find something I really wanted to find for this.There’s a cave somewhere, I remember reading about it in college - some cavers used all kinds of modern equipment to penetrate farther into an underwater cave system than anyone had ever gone before. They found an inner air pocket cave and surfaced, and … well…Someone had covered it in art already.Now this cave was old enough that it’s probably different now than it was back then. It’s entirely possible that the people who painted that cave didn’t have to traverse quite so much underwater river to get where they were going…But the point is, we have a tendency to underestimate the people who came before us, which is a shame becausePeople have always been brilliant. All the way back to the flint-knappers and beyond. That brilliance has just taken many forms over time, and not all of it is preserved.Not all of it has survived.We’ve had to regrow many parts of the forest over and over again, sometimes just because of bad luck… other times because people feel threatened by truth and burn down entire glades to scare it away.","220,624 followers",Franklin Veaux,1.8K,47.3K,783M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Is-it-possible-that-with-the-increase-in-dependence-on-technology-humans-will-evolve-to-be-more-stupid
