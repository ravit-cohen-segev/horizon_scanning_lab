If a place on a drive is magnetized it is assigned a 1 and if not a 0 thus giving us binary. Data is not something tangible, its a form of energy: the magnetic force is what we use to store data normally and what makes magnets work, it is a basic force that is created by electrons and their motion.500MB is SMALL, bigger than atoms smaller than DNA.Note: I am in no way qualified to say that I know all of this information of the top of my head, if my math or answer is wrong please let me know where I messed up and I will try to revise it. :D",355 followers,Taciano Dreckmann Perez,1.1K,77,3M,2017,https://www.quora.com/How-much-real-world-space-does-500MB-take-up

It is an antiquated base with a very few modern tests stuffs for fighter aircraft etc. It is mostly nothing like the movies at all.No there are no deep in the mountain funky super labs with all of the fancy developments like in the movie Independence Day. If the rush on the base happens and they threw the base open the rushers would find a most disappointing base.I know what the USAF, NAVY and ARMY have (Even the Space Force) and let it suffice to say that most people would find it most disappointing compared to their imagination. This is not to say that there isn’t some things worth keeping secret there. But it probably would be in the end a most unexciting trudge across the desert for very long distances in really hot weather to find old computers, old buildings and a few very hot soldiers.The biggest problem with civilians going out there is the “Area 51” is a bombing range. Lots of the area is pretty dangerous to walk around int. I really would recommend people find somewhere else to consider worthy of their time.The reason the US keeps those secret bases out there in Nevada and similar place...","220,648 followers",Franklin Veaux,992,47.3K,783.2M,2019,https://www.quora.com/How-much-real-world-space-does-500MB-take-up

6,Buran itself was not discharged and supposed to be reused like a Shuttle. A first stage boosters was supposed by design to be saved and reused but it never been tried on practice. No much difference with Shuttle which tried to save by parashute landing in the sea the side boosters.Main difference was in the rocket.​Buran itself was not discharged and supposed to be reused like a Shuttle.

No much difference with Shuttle which tried to save by parashute landing in the sea the side boosters.Main difference was in the rocket.​Another important difference was ability of Buran to do a fully automatic landing and starting. In fact the one and only maiden flight in 1988 was unmanned. Shuttle was unable to land without a pilot in control.,57 followers,Moe Incanto,708,97,596.3K,2016,https://www.quora.com/How-much-real-world-space-does-500MB-take-up
