0,"In essence, cryptocurrency mining is the process of finding and verifying groups of transactions — called blocks — and adding them to other blocks, forming a blockchain. Through mining, cryptocurrency transactions are settled and added to the decentralized ledger.Take for example a cryptocurrency transaction between two siblings, Joe and Suzy. Joe and Suzy buy an 80” flat screen TV for their dad as a holiday present. Suzy buys the TV with her credit card so she can earn cash back rewards. To reimburse Suzy, Joe pays her in cryptocurrency money.

Through mining, cryptocurrency transactions are settled and added to the decentralized ledger.Take for example a cryptocurrency transaction between two siblings, Joe and Suzy. Joe and Suzy buy an 80” flat screen TV for their dad as a holiday present. Suzy buys the TV with her credit card so she can earn cash back rewards. To reimburse Suzy, Joe pays her in cryptocurrency money. Once Joe submits the payment, the transaction is sent to the network. For the transaction to settle, it must be mined. Once the transaction is mined and verified, it is added to the blockchain. There are two primary protocols for cryptocurrency mining, proof-of-work (PoW) and proof-of-stake (PoS).Proof-of-work mining uses computing and processing power to validate a block. This is accomplished by running complex algorithms which solve a set of problems. All blocks in a network start as short strings of meaningless data called nonces. Miners, using their mining software, must search for the meaningless string such that the block satisfies a given condition. Because the conditions are arbitrary and the nonces are by nature meaningless, the mining process must be done via trial and error.A given block can theoretically have an infinite amount of miners. However, the miner who walks away with the reward, a newly mined coin, is the one who solves the block first. Thus miners who have greater processing power can find solutions much more quickly than those with less sophisticated devices. This is why people join mining pools to combine resources.One of the biggest problems with PoW mining is the processing requirement. Miners must meet computing requirements to mine a block, whether individual or pooled. The more blocks are mined, the more stringent the computing requirements become. Some people are prevented from mining blocks because they only don’t have the computing power to process the block. Therefore, mining through a PoW protocol is met with decreasing profitability because more computing power (energy, hardware, software, etc.) is required to mine.Proof-of-stake mining has the same goal as PoW mining — to validate transactions. However, the process is quite different. In PoS mining, the blockchain keeps a record of “validators,” defined as anyone who holds a stake in the blockchain’s currency (e.g., Bitcoins for the Bitcoin blockchain). Validators can initiate a stake by “locking up” their coin into a deposit. Like PoW mining, PoS mining utilizes an algorithm. However, with PoS mining the algorithm randomly selects a validator and gives them the right to mine a specific block. In this sense, PoS mining is somewhat like a lottery.The ability to mine is related to the number of coins at stake. So a miner with 2% of Bitcoin’s supply can only mine 2% of the supply. Because of the way PoS mining works, miners are rewarded more for seniority and ownership than raw processing power. As a result, PoS mining requires much less computing power and is therefore much more economical. Additionally, PoS mining prevents centralization from occurring by spreading out mining capabilities. With a PoW mining system, someone could theoretically purchase a majority of the available processing power and monopolize the process.PoS mining is also more user-friendly than PoW mining. PoW mining requires a greater understanding of coding and programming, resulting in a more concentrated (centralized) base. PoS mining, however, is relatively easy and can be done by merely staking a position and leaving one’s wallet and mining software running.

The nonce can be found as a 4 byte field in a black header, and sees its value adjusted by miners so that the hash of the block will be less than or equal to the current target hash value set by the network.","99,918 followers",Alcatraz Dey,9K,1.4K,68.3M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-actual-concept-of-bitcoin-mining

It is frequently referred to as the ""silver to bitcoin's gold."" Charlie Lee, an MIT graduate and former Google developer, developed it. Litecoin is built on an open source, decentralised global payment network that use ""scrypt"" as a proof of work and can be decoded with the aid of consumer-grade CPUs.2) Ethereum (ETH)A decentralised software platform called Ethereum, which was introduced in 2015, makes it possible to create and manage distributed applications (DApps) and smart contracts without the need for third parties' oversight, control, or interference. As a kind of transportation on the Ethereum network, ether is sought for by developers who want to create and run applications there, as well as investors who want to use ether to buy other cryptocurrencies.3) Bitcoin CashBitcoin Cash has an important place in the history of cryptocurrencies because it was one of the first and most popular hard forks of the original bitcoin. As a result of discussions and arguments between developers and miners, there is a rift in the bitcoin community. Due to its distributed nature of digital currencies, major modifications to the source code underpinning the token or coin in question must be approved by the majority; the specific cryptocurrency determines the mechanism for this process.4) Zcash(ZEC)The modular, open-source cryptocurrency Zcash, which was introduced before the end of 2016, appears promising. One way zcash describes itself is that it is ""https"" if bitcoin is like http for money. Zcash provides transaction privacy and limited transaction transparency.5) Monero(XMR)Monero is a safe, discrete, and untraceable form of money. When this open-source cryptocurrency first appeared in April 2014, the cryptography community and enthusiasts quickly became very interested in it. This coin is entirely community- and donation-driven in its development. With a strong emphasis on decentralisation and scalability from the beginning, Monero provides total privacy through the use of a unique method known as ""ring signatures.""I made a lot of money after learning about coincrypto (www.coincrypto.tech), where I can get back twice what I invested in a week.

BTC is the first cryptocurrency to be developed and remains the largest by market cap. It remains the first crypto people look at when venturing into the crypto space.Ethereum (ETH)Ethereum has played second fiddle to Bitcoin for a long time now. It is the second-largest crypto by market cap and remains perhaps the most widely used altcoin. It joins this exclusive list because of the upcoming changes to the Ethereum network.So far this year, the price of ETH has spiked, similar to what other cryptocurrencies have experienced. However, the price could surge even higher in the coming months. Ethereum is now looking to move away from the Proof of Work (PoW) blockchain to become a Proof of Stake (PoS) network. This means the cryptocurrency would be staked instead of mined.Dash (DASH)One of the cryptocurrencies that could be benefiting from the ongoing COVID 19 outbreak is Dash. The World Health Organization (WHO) recently notified the general public that the virus could be transmitted through the exchange of paper cash. As such, people are advised to use contactless technology to receive payment.Ripple (XRP)XRP is another cryptocurrency that is gaining wide adoption, thanks to the various technologies rolled out by Ripple. An increasing number of traditional banks across the globe are using XRP and its technologies for faster, cheaper and easier cross-border transactions.Tron (TRX)Tron has been one of the most exciting cryptocurrencies for a long time now. The founder, Justin Sun, ensures that his project is one of the leading cryptocurrencies and continues to make moves that could help boost the network.Recently, Tron took over Steemit, the blockchain-based social media platform.

It would just be the payment method of choice,” Lee once said.Litecoin is also designed to produce more coins -- it has an 84 million coin limit, versus bitcoin’s 21 million.

Bitcoin Cash was created by a team of people who forked the bitcoin blockchain ledger. It is now controlled by multiple independent teams of developers.The skinny: Bitcoin Cash is among the newest of the cryptocurrencies, developed in August of 2017 as a hard fork of bitcoin. What’s that? Essentially a new version of bitcoin that’s incompatible with bitcoin.Bitcoin Cash was created as some users were frustrated by high fees and slow processing times. Because Bitcoin Cash has a greater block size limit, its creators say the cryptocurrency has more capacity to handle transactions with lower fees and faster confirmations. On the other side of that reasoning, though, are the bitcoin loyalists who believe that increasing block sizes endangers the cryptocurrency’s decentralized nature. The philosophical divide between bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash was aptly described by Forbes as “Cypherpunk Vs. Silicon Valley.”The biggest challenge facing Bitcoin Cash right now is adoption: For it to be valuable, it needs to convince businesses to accept both bitcoin AND the rival payment network. It also needs to convince miners to participate in the transaction-clearing process.In mid-November, Bitcoin Cash briefly topped Ethereum’s market cap to become the second-most valuable crypto. Since then it’s fallen back into third place. Its circulating supply is currently at 16.8 million, out of a maximum supply of 21 million.After knowledge of coincrypto (www.coincrypto.tech) where i do get double of my invested within a week, i got so much profit. and i would advice you check and know more about them because they are very reliable platform .",0 followers,Steph Brooks,894,0,0,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-best-future-cryptocurrency

You can make your research and if you find the platform deem fit then you can go ahead just like i did.When it was first launched, the price of the EOS cryptocurrency sat at $2.29. However, it then doubled in less than 24 hours, with EOS hitting $5.40.This hike did not last, however, and the coin soon started falling, breaking one support level after another. EOS found its bottom at $0.59, which is where it remained until late October 2017. Once the crypto bull run that marked the year reached its peak, EOS joined the rally, and it skyrocketed to $16.39 on January 13, 2018.However, while most coins peaked around this date or earlier, EOS' all-time high came later, in April 2018. In mid-April, the crypto market – which had been crashing since January – started seeing a new bullish wave. Prices started going up, and many assumed that the so-called 'crypto winter' was over.These days, we know that the surge in April was only the eye of the storm, as the crash continued as May 2018 arrived. But, for those few weeks, the EOS price jumped once more, breaking its former record, and going up to $22.89. This was the coin's highest price, and it has never reached these highs again, at least so far.Following this second surge, EOS kept dropping, briefly stopped by support here and there, but eventually, it dropped to its new bottom at $1.86 around December 7, 2018. In 2019, the coin saw gradual growth, although it progressed slowly, and everything it had achieved by mid-2019 was undone in the second half of the year, as it slowly returned to the level where it sat ever since – between $2 and $2.8.The EOS price has fluctuated in this range, except for on three occasions in 2020. The first one was between mid-January and mid-February, when it joined another bull run that took it to $5.35. The second was in August 2020, when it hit $3.7, and the last one is right now, led by Bitcoin (BTC), which is once again approaching its all-time highs at $20,000.EOS, on the other hand, is as far away from its own record as it can be, hovering around $3.26.What is happening to EOS these days?Unfortunately, EOS has not been making headlines in 2020, as the crypto industry is mostly focused on the decentralised finance (DeFi) sector. When DeFi started slowing down, bull runs took over, and most of the attention went to Bitcoin.However, that does not mean that EOS has been doing nothing. Its developers at Block.one recently announced the EOS Resource Model proposal, and the soon-to-arrive review of various talented organisations that responded to the company's invitation to evaluate their code.Block.one also recently expressed its pleasure with how Spielworks built a rewards and loyalty platform for gamers using EOSIO.The company also worked on adding new features to its Training and Certification segment of the blockchain.And, of course, as a development platform, EOS has also been making moves to attract people to develop new DeFi projects on its network. The network already has quite a few successful projects, although the majority of the developers are still focusing on developing DeFi on Ethereum.EOS price prediction 2021: what to expect from EOS going forward?Lastly, we arrive at the most interesting part — EOS coin price prediction for 2021 and beyond.According to TradingBeasts, the EOS price in December 2020 will reach a maximum of $3.4, after which the forecasting service expects it to drop back down to $2.7, on average.In January 2021, its EOS crypto price prediction shows the coin remaining near this level, at around $2.7, later expecting it to experience a slow but steady rise throughout the year, with the coin having the potential to hit a high of $3.9 next December. The average price of EOS is predicted to reach $4.07 in December 2022, and then $5.03 in December 2023.Wallet Investor also expects the currency’s price to rise in early 2021, although their EOS coin forecast says that the asset will see a price crash in the second half of the year. The event will potentially lead EOS down to $1.2 one year from now.As for CryptoGround, they have a very bullish EOS prediction. In fact, their EOS forecast claims that the coin will simply keep climbing, with its value reaching $4.17 in six months, $4.7 in one year, and $21.4 by December 2025.",0 followers,Gerhard Walter,1.1K,54,915.7K,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-best-future-cryptocurrency

The first ever transaction between Satoshi Nakamoto the anonymous founder of bitcoin sending 10 BTC to Hal Finney, a famous computer programmer & cryptographer would constitute the first transaction that was added to the blockchain as all the previous blocks contained only coinbase transactions for the block reward of 50 BTC.Short introduction to MiningMining is intentionally designed to be resource-intensive and difficult so that the number of blocks found each day by miners remains steady. Individual blocks must contain a proof of work (Pow) to be considered valid. This proof of work is verified by other Bitcoin nodes each time they receive a block. Bitcoin uses the hashcash proof-of-work function.The primary purpose of mining is to set the history of transactions in a way that is computationally impractical to modify by any entity.Mining is also the mechanism used to introduce Bitcoins into the system: Miners are paid any transaction fees as well as a ""subsidy"" of newly created coins. This both serves the purpose of disseminating new coins in a decentralized manner as well as motivating people to provide security for the system.Bitcoin mining is so called because it resembles the mining of other commodities: it requires exertion and it slowly makes new units available to anybody who wishes to take part. An important difference is that the supply does not depend on the amount of mining. In general changing total miner hashpower does not change how many bitcoins are created over the long term.Mining difficulty is adjusted every 2016 blocks taking into account the increase or decrease in the number of miners putting in hash power.Genesis block and initial mining :When the people on the mailing list to whom Satoshi Nakamoto sent the original whitepaper, many of them presumably started mining using their computers when the difficulty of mining was the lowest and the block reward being the highest at 50 BTC / 10 min albeit a few weeks after Hal Finney got involved after tweeting thisThese early miners from 2009 onwards who mined solo mined blocks by simply running the Bitcoin client (AKA Satoshi client/ Bitcoin QT / Bitcoind ). These according to me were the best bitcoin miner machines ever present because they did not require any special setup and programming, could run in the background and utilize the idle CPU power to carry out the mining process and used just a little bit more than your usual electricity and solo mining was possible so you would not need to pay any % of pool fees or divide the block reqard. As the difficulty started increasing as more people started to mine bitcoin the progression was as followsCost of mining : Only electricity bill for running the computerTime to generate 1 BTC :approx 10 minutesProgress in mining :In October 2010 - GPU mining code was released to the general public. As mining difficulty rose so did the need for better, more dedicated hardware. Intially single GPU and eventually mining rigs consisting of series of GPUs attached to a minimum DRAM PC with a basic CPU was put to the task of mining bitcoin & would require lot of electricity. Nvidia Graphics cards were used such as the GTX 560 which provided a good ROI. As bitcoin started getting popular after listing on exchange and it hit the 1$ price many more jumped in the mining arena and further increasing the mining difficulty.Cost : 200 to 800$ + electricity cost(Pic 2: GPU mining rig using PCI express of motherboard slots to connect 6 GPU in series via risers mounted on an aluminium frame)By June 2011 field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) were introduced as GPU mining was no longer profitable. FPGAs utilized less electricity but required technical expertise and tweaking to run them for mining.Cost : 500 to 1000$ (Not really sure as i could not find a good source)(Pic 3: FPGA)As of now ASIC miners are required to mine Bitcoin and the block reward is 12.5 which will be halved to 6.25 somewhere in May 2020. ASIC miners are purpose specific and require a substantial investment and utilize a huge amount of electricity to mine bitcoin.Cost 1500 to 3000$The formula for calculation of profitability of Bitcoin is as follows :B = (h t R)/(2^32 D)This formula is also applicable to any other Proof of Work cryptocurrency using the SHA 256 and can extend to others using a different algorithm such as Ethash , Equihash, Scrypt, x11, Cryptonight etcDays required to mine a bitcoin depends on a lot of factors such as your ASIC hashing power, cost of electricity, current dificultyUsing the above formula and considering a single ASICminer 8 nano pro which has a hashrate of 80 TH/Sec it would require approximately 10 months to mine 1 whole bitcoin (100 million satoshis) at the current price, hashrate and difficulty.
