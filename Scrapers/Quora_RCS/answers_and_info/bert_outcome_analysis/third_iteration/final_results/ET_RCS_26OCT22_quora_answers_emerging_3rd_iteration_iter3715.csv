0,You have it backwards. The ones that start wars do so for political aims and they use their technological prowess to try to have an edge on their target.The political aim of dictatorships that start wars is often to distract the people of their country to prevent the people from overthrowing them.Global respect has little to do with it.,469 followers,Daniel Cohort,11.9K,377,1.2M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Why-do-some-countries-fail-to-advance-technologically-and-socially

5,"Yes. Churches are businesses. If the business operates as a non-profit, meaning that their income goes right back out in charitable ways, then they won’t be taxed because they didn’t make a profit. If they make money, however, then ABSOLUTELY they should be taxed like any other business.Employees of the church should be taxed on their personal income just like anyone else. If an employee of the church receives tangible assets (cars, homes, planes, etc.), those assets should be taxed.",18 followers,Asim Qureshi,12.7K,996,156M,2017,https://www.quora.com/Why-do-some-countries-fail-to-advance-technologically-and-socially

If Space-X had stopped with the development of the Falcon-9 booster (as part of such a NASA program) this would be a huge win for the taxpayer, as that alone has slashed space launch costs across the industry and reinfused the industry with competitive pressure.If Space-X succeeds with its current plans, NASA will be happy to book passed on the resulting booster—just as they plan to on Falcon, just as they routinely do on airliners to carry their staff around the world on business. They will free up large sums of money that NASA can spend on its real job—basic research.",0 followers,Ezio Yao,858,215,5.9M,2020,https://www.quora.com/If-America-was-to-tax-churches-and-put-all-that-revenue-into-NASA-how-much-more-advanced-technology-would-we-be

8,"It is their charter to invent and explore technology and bring those technologies back to the US people.But due to harsh environments and remote locations, they tend to build systems very conservatively. Many successful systems have had lifetimes many times in excess of the original design. Some systems with life time of 5 years have lasted as long as 19 years!Some aeronautical engineers call the rockets from Huntsville, “The Bridge and Iron Works” because the way many rockets were over-built. But “over built” prevented other problems and the Saturn series got USA to the moon.I worked at NASAIt is their charter to invent and explore technology and bring those technologies back to the US people.But due to harsh environments and remote locations, they tend to build systems very conservatively.

After all, they systems are deep in space and a computer glitch could lead to loss of a spacecraft which is a one-of-a-kind.NASA Systems Engineering is unique. For the reliability of one-of-kind systems is difficult.Their testing of software is much more rigors, through, thought out, and expansive of any software development teams. And they are willing to spend to the money on hardware and software to test out “Flight Software.”I had the privilege to work with one of the programmers of the Apollo Guidance Computer. He is in his 70’s and does not want to stop programming.","5,990 followers",Jens Böttiger,566,2.6K,17.6M,2019,https://www.quora.com/If-America-was-to-tax-churches-and-put-all-that-revenue-into-NASA-how-much-more-advanced-technology-would-we-be
9,"The constraints of technology, and the insane expense of getting a manned mission to the asteroid belt, along with the ludicrous cost of setting up, maintaining, and resupplying a base which would have to remain active for the several years it would take to engineer and construct the machinery needed to effect a change in orbit of a massive nickel-iron body.Just getting out there would take 3–5 years using current technology, and the payload per vessel would be (at best) 5–10% of the minimum needed to construct something viable.This would be after the multi-year lift and construction process fThe constraints of technology, and the insane expense of getting a manned mission to the asteroid belt, along with the ludicrous cost of setting up, maintaining, and resupplying a base which would have to remain active for the several years it would take to engineer and construct the machinery needed to effect a change in orbit of a massive nickel-iron body.Just getting out there would take 3–5 years using current technology, and the payload per vessel would be (at best) 5–10% of the minimum needed to construct something viable.This would be after the multi-year lift and construction process for one vessel.So, increase the lead time by 10–20 times to get all the materials in orbit, and all the reaction mass for the trip out (and some for the return trip,) and all the reaction mass needed to deflect and aim the asteroid. Then, getNow, you have to build the enormous reaction engines, support systems, fuel storage, control systems, etc. needed to create your projectile. Along with that you will need habitation modules for the crew, since Man is not capable of building a machine of such incredible complexity without having any points of failure.So, yeah, it could be done, if you had a population fanatic enough to live in starvation for 90–120 years. You would have to operate your nation in a state of utter penury, providing no services of any kind to your citizens, without being destroyed by every other nation on the planet, or having your own country self-immolate in revolution and/or civil war.You would also have to be stupid enough to think that an impact great enough to destroy another nation would not have far-reaching negative impacts on the rest of the world.In short, you would have to be too insane and stupid to ever have a hope of reaching your goal.",469 followers,Daniel Cohort,11.9K,377,1.2M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Why-do-some-countries-fail-to-advance-technologically-and-socially

13,"Yes - providing we detect it a LONG time in advance.The problem with something that’s moving SO fast and which weighs SO much - you can’t stop it and you can’t destroy it.So all you can do is to deflect it, so that it misses.Bad Sci Fi movies have the governments of the world launching every nuclear weapon available at it.But this wouldn’t create a reliable force in the right direction to deflect the asteroid…and we know that some asteroids are relatively fragile and might split into multiple smaller asteroids that would be even harder to deflect.So what is needed is a GENTLE force - applied fYes - providing we detect it a LONG time in advance.The problem with something that’s moving SO fast and which weighs SO much - you can’t stop it and you can’t destroy it.So all you can do is to deflect it, so that it misses.Bad Sci Fi movies have the governments of the world launching every nuclear weapon available at it.But this wouldn’t create a reliable force in the right direction to deflect the asteroid…and we know that some asteroids are relatively fragile and might split into multiple smaller asteroids that would be even harder to deflect.So what is needed is a GENTLE force - applied for a long period of time - not just whacking it hard and hoping.What we’ll need to do is to spot the killer asteroid 20 or 30 years before it’s projected impact.Then we can carefully tailor a spacecraft to fly out to the asteroid - and either push gently against it for years - to fly a parallel course alongside it. Doing that would create a very gentle gravitational force between asteroid and spacecraft - which would subtly but VERY precisely adjust it’s course.A change in direction of even a tiny fraction of one degree builds up to an enormous difference in the position of the asteroid decades later - resulting in a safe “MISS” rather than a catastrophic “HIT”.What the world needs is not some pre-built, ready to go, emergency solution to the problem.We need decades of warning.So what is required is a lot of powerful telescopes - and a lot of observers looking through them…and that’s what we actually have!Right now, the experts are fairly certain that they’ve found all of the asteroids that are big enough to cause a global catastrophe anytime within the next 50 years…and none of them are a risk.",0 followers,Nicolai Guldberg,651,52,53K,2020,https://www.quora.com/If-America-was-to-tax-churches-and-put-all-that-revenue-into-NASA-how-much-more-advanced-technology-would-we-be
