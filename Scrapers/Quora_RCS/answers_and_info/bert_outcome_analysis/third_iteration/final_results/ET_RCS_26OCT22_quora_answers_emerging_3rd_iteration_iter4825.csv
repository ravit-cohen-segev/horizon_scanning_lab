Its front is very well armored, but its sides and rear are essentially paper thin.Especially Leopard tanks without the vital A5 upgrade are terribly vulnerable to attack along the flanks as we experienced painfully in Syria, and A5 only helps to a certain degree. The tropical climate where engagement range is short and concealment plenty, is the direct opposite of the Leopard’s intended terrain. This is without even mentioning the weight of the Leopard, which is doomed to raise a pretty big issue in somewhere like Philippines.While any nation with a military worth being called that should own a fleet of MBT’s, if I was heading the Philippines, I would spend the most of my effort for light tanks, motor gun carriages, and IFV’s.","91,619 followers",Roland Bartetzko,864,3.5K,314.7M,2017,https://www.quora.com/Is-the-Leopard-2-main-battle-tank-effective-in-tropical-countries
1,"The Leopard 2 is just fine with tropical climate use. However, the tactics employed need to be correct for the situation at hand.On the modern battlefield you just do not spam in tanks as if you are playing some star craft like game - you need combined arms, very good recon and of course guarded flanks and also protection against top attack and air.This is not new either it has been the way of war for a very long time now.I am a trained cold-war anti-tank gunner (TOW) and of course there is a big difference between being the softer part in the meatgrinder meeting red tank battallions head on aThe Leopard 2 is just fine with tropical climate use.

However, what they encounter should not come to a shock to them if they are properly trained since also during the cold war and even WW2 infantery had gained close range anti-tank weapons which were effective (Bazooka, Panzerfaust, Panzerschreck or even some anti-tank riffles early on).You need to equip your army according to the environment you are in, who you are fighting and what you want the end state of the operation to be. As such, tanks are just a tool of the trade, and without knowing the things I just mentioned, it is impossible to tell you if it will be a good idea or not to bring tanks to the slaughter. Some parts of the tropics might be well suited to tanks, others parts not so much. Mind you, anyone taking a shot at a Leopard 2 from a distance risks being engaged by it and has zero guarantee that they will take it out when hitting its front armor.What you should not do is to impose limitations on your tactics and force formed from a stand point of other formations failures to properly apply their weapons and tactics. Instead, you should focus on when, where and how to use yours and be able to do so in practice not just in theory.There is no one weapon system that dominates the battlefield today. What dominates are tactics and abilities to apply them correctly. Intelligence. Having the option of inserting tanks into a given situation is a good card to have in your deck.That was my 2 cents on this.","1,155 followers",Jack Vony,1.3K,204,7.4M,2017,https://www.quora.com/Is-the-Leopard-2-main-battle-tank-effective-in-tropical-countries

The NO11M bars radar is one of the most complex and powerful PESA( passive electronically scanned array) radar in the world.

7,"In aviation circles it is a well acknowledged fact that the Flankers (Su-30 Family) are class above the F-15 or F-16s.Particularly Su-30MKI is an epitome of design supremacy, its canards and thrust vectoring makes it super- maneuverable with near zero stall speed, which allows its pilots to engage into maneuvers which were earlier considered impossible to execute (cobra maneuver).Pak owned F-16D are of Block 50/52 production configuration, it’s a relatively old set-up which can’t really be compared to SU-30 MKIs,In aviation circles it is a well acknowledged fact that the Flankers (Su-30 Family) are class above the F-15 or F-16s.Particularly Su-30MKI is an epitome of design supremacy, its canards and thrust vectoring makes it super- maneuverable with near zero stall speed, which allows its pilots to engage into maneuvers which were earlier considered impossible to execute (cobra maneuver).Pak owned F-16D are of Block 50/52 production configuration, it’s a relatively old set-up which can’t really be compared to SU-30 MKIs, one of the most advanced and updated versions of Flankers which combines technologies from Israel, Russia and Indian DRDO. In short both are of different class and hence aren’t the right candidates to fight against.F-16 was developed in 1970s, though it was regularly upgraded and modified however structural limitations doesn’t provide enough room for big changes. On the other hand India started taking deliveries of SU-30MKIs in early 2000 only,The same has been proved many times in various war exercise. During 2008 Red-Flag air combat exercise IAF fighter pilots with 6 Sukhoi-30 proved more than a match for their American counterparts with F15 and F16.As per the eyewitness account of a senior Indian journalist “Vishnu Som”, who was among the observers during the exercise:IAF and its Sukhois more than made a mark during their stint in the United States. “For starters not a single Su-30MKI fighter was shot down in close air combat missions at Mountain Home AFB. In fact, none of the Sukhois were even close to being shot down in the 10-odd one on one sorties which were planned for the first two days of the exercises at Mountain Home. These one on one engagements featured USAF jets such as the F-15 and F-16 in close air engagements against the Su-30MKI. The majority of the kills claimed in these engagements were granted to the IAF with the remainder of these being no-results.By the time the exercises at Mountain Home had matured the IAF had graduated to large formation exercises which featured dozens of jets in the sky. In one of these exercises, the blue forces, of which the IAF was a part, shot down more than 21 of the enemy jets. Most of these `kills’ have been credited to the IAF.This was turned out to be a major source of embarrassment for the host as the USAF had everything – AWACS-Linked F16, Identification Friend or Foe Mode 4 etc and the IAF had nothing.In an another war-game in 2015, Sukhois were pitted against even more advanced Eurofighter Typhoons IAF pilots flying Sukhoi Su-30 MKI fighters had a resounding 12-0 score-line in their favour against Royal Air Force Typhoon jets in Within Visual Range (WVR) dogfighting operations.In subsequent Large Force Exercises which featured combined Eurofighter Typhoon and Su-30 formations, the IAF jets were somewhat less successfulHaving proved its mettle against likes of Eurofighter and F-15 Eagle then I think comparing Sukhois to F-16 is immaturity.Moreover, for Su-30 MKI having a thrust vectoring means its angle of attack can be extreme, it has 2 engines so its range acceleration is also superior to F16, also it carries far more fuel and armaments so combat radius and fire-power is twice that of similar planes.Additionally having a larger size allows it to house a mightier radar (NIIP N011M BARS), which along with its advanced Infrared Search and Track System can scan over a wider width, at twice the speed, over a greater range.It allows Su-30MKI to function as a mini-AWACS and as a director or command post for other aircraft.In-short India doesn’t need to send two Sukhoi MKIs for each outdated and obsolete version of F16s which Pak air force has. On an even day a flanker can easily engage and destroy four F-16 simultaneously in BWR war game.Another point of view:India is now a mammoth consumer of western defense tech and machines, being the largest defense purchaser India provides billions of dollars to US coffers in exchange of its technology (which Pak can’t really afford even in dreams), hence under no circumstances US would want to upset India by offering a cutting-edge technology to India’s arch-rival Pakistan (same holds good with Russia as well).Additionally Pak’s tacit support to terror groups on their land forces other countries to not sell their cutting-edge war machines to Pakistan.So please rest assured, since our real Man-in-Blue are in action we can sleep peacefully in our cozy beds.",0 followers,Shari Williams,1.5K,687,1.6M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Is-the-Leopard-2-main-battle-tank-effective-in-tropical-countries
