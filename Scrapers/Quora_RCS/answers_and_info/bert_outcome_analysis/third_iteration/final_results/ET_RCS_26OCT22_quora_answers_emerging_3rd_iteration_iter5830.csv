That is because it likely has not been written by a human.Artificial Intelligence (AI), Robotics, Machine Learning, NLP, etc are all being used in journalism. Most publishers use some degree of automation to pre-populate drafts based on NLP or Fuzzy Logic and then have the human writers and editors work on refining them for final publication. [1]> …Bloomberg news is one of the first adaptors of this automated content. Their program, Cyborg, churned out thousands of articles last year that took financial reports and turned them into news stories like a business reporter.Forbes also uses an AI took called Bertie to assist in providing reporters with first drafts and templates for news stories.The Washington Post also has a robot reporting program called Heliograf. In its first year, it produced approximately 850 articles…Like how The LA Times is using AI to report on earthquakes based on data from the U.S. geological survey and also tracks homicide information on every homicide committed in the city of Los Angeles. The site created by the machine called “Homicide Report” utilizes a robot-reporter with the ability to include in its reports tons of data that includes: the victim’s gender and race, cause of death, officer involvement, neighborhood and year of death.This approach works well for objective reporting in cases that mostly consist of numbers, figures, statistics, and different slices and dices of data — earnings report, economic data, demographic studies, live sports updates, elections. [2]> Examples of machine-generated articles from The Associated Press:TYSONS CORNER, Va. (AP) — MicroStrategy Inc. (MSTR) on Tuesday reported fourth-quarter net income of $3.3 million, after reporting a loss in the same period a year earlier.MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) — Jonathan Davis hit for the cycle, as the New Hampshire Fisher Cats topped the Portland Sea Dogs 10-3 on Tuesday.Bots and automatons have become so significant to reporting that there are separate award categories to recognize their contributions.> The Post has an in-house robot reporter called Heliograf, which demonstrated its usefulness with its coverage of the 2016 Summer Olympic Games and the 2016 elections. Last year, thanks to Heliograf, The Post won in the category of Excellence in Use of Bots at the annual Global Biggies Awards, which recognize accomplishments in the use of big data and artificial intelligence.Technology use is not limited to simply preparing first drafts, but also to schedule and publish, take care of SEO and social media publishing, data crunching and analysis, visualizing the larger picture around the article, and to identify fake news.Examples:#1: Washington Post — Knowledge Map [ https://www.washingtonpost.com/pr/wp/2015/07/16/the-washington-post-tests-new-knowledge-map-feature/ ] (Providing background information)> Knowledge Map gives readers an easier way to catch up on ongoing stories by quickly and seamlessly providing relevant background, additional information or answers to frequently asked questions, when the reader wants it.#2: NYT — Editor [ https://nytlabs.com/projects/editor.html ] (Automated tagging and annotation)> Editor is an experimental text editing interface that explores how collaboration between machine learning systems and journalists could afford fine-grained annotation and tagging of news articles. Our approach applies machine learning techniques interactively, as part of the writing process, rather than retroactively. This approach can offload the burden of work to the computational processes, and can create affordances for journalists to augment, edit and correct those processes with their knowledge.#3: BBC — Juicer [ https://bbcnewslabs.co.uk/projects/juicer/ ] (Automated RSS feed monitoring and aggregation)> BBC Juicer is a news aggregation 'pipeline'. It ingests news articles and extracts the best from them - well, just like a fruit juicer does. BBC Juicer pipeline is watching RSS feeds of news outlets. When a new article is published on one of these RSS feeds, BBC Juicer scrapes the news article, both raw text and metadata (e.g. date, time, title, news source ...). In the next step BBC Juicer identifies and tags concepts mentioned in the article text making them searchable and therefore useful for trend analysis. The Juicer API allows users to retrieve JSON representations of the news articles.Fun experiment — you can try AIWriter [ https://panel.ai-writer.com/aiw/simpleui/homesite/ ] to create automated news stories for any topic. I did so for “Australian Bushfire” and below is the output (complete with references). Eerie!> The 2019-2020 Australian bushfire season runs from June 2019 to March 2020, and the scale of these seasonal fires is unprecedented. At least 34 people were killed, more than 5,900 buildings, including 2,779 homes, were destroyed and an estimated 46 million hectares burned. The summer months of December and January were particularly devastating, when hundreds of fires were burning and a state of emergency was declared. Wildfires occur throughout the summer in Australia, typically in February.A severe drought, which has led to the hottest and driest year on record, combined with persistently high temperatures and windy conditions, has created a very dangerous fire situation in many areas of the country. A series of massive bushfires in Australia have been fuelled by record temperatures, drought and strong winds in recent months.Authorities in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) have declared a state of emergency as a massive bushfire rages south of Canberra. Hot and windy conditions are expected to return to much of New South Wales over the weekend. Although recent cooler conditions and rain have eased some of the fire's flames, more than 50 fires are still burning nationwide, according to the Bureau of Meteorology.The state is entering the bushfire season, putting many districts at high risk of bushfires, according to the Australian Bureau of Meteorology. The ongoing bushfires and wildfires confirm warnings by researchers several years ago that bushfires are on the rise across Australia due to climate change. A warming climate in Australia is accompanied by heat waves, characterized by increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather events such as heat waves, droughts and floods.The Bureau of Meteorology said in its 2003 annual ...",18 followers,Asim Qureshi,4.1K,996,156M,2020,https://www.quora.com/I-own-a-site-that-contains-articles-is-converting-it-to-an-emerging-technology-company

Much of what is controversial now, starts as social scientific theory, and ends up as political change.Humanities has always been strong, and again subjects like history and geography, probably never been more influential in society than now.Additionally, many fields within social science and humanities adopt methods from natural sciences to achieve new levels of knowledge.",29 followers,Brandon Ross,658,13.2K,64.2M,2020,https://www.quora.com/I-own-a-site-that-contains-articles-is-converting-it-to-an-emerging-technology-company

Our team at Grammarly has compiled a handy list of common grammatical errors to help make your writing accurate, clear, and professional.Ambiguous (“Squinting”) modifiersA squinting modifier is a misplaced modifier that, because of its location in a sentence, could modify either the phrase that precedes it or the one that follows it.

Our team at Grammarly has compiled a handy list of common grammatical errors to help make your writing accurate, clear, and professional.Ambiguous (“Squinting”) modifiersA squinting modifier is a misplaced modifier that, because of its location in a sentence, could modify either the phrase that precedes it or the one that follows it. In the example sentence, is the subject listening to music slowly or slowly getting a headache? To correct a squinting modifier, move its position in the sentence to clarify to the reader which word you intend to modify.Misuse of lie/layIf you plan to place or put an object somewhere, such as a plate on a table, you should use “lay.” If you intend to stretch out on a bed for a nap, you should use “lie.” The verb “lie” is an intransitive verb, which means it does not need an object. The transitive verb “lay” requires an object.It may take some getting used to this “lay” or “lie” business; after all, misuse of these verbs is common. But if you remember to lay down your fork before you’re full, then you won’t have to lie down later from overeating.Comma splicesHe was very hungry, so he ate a whole pizza.To splice means to connect or join. When a writer joins two independent sentences with a comma instead of separating them with a period or coordinating conjunction, that’s a comma splice.The comma has its jobs to do, but connecting two independent sentences isn’t one of them. Besides, the period gets testy when his sister, the comma, steals his thunder. Periods have their jobs, and so do commas, but never the twain shall meet—unless it’s in the form of a semicolon. Semicolons can also take the place of a coordinating conjunction, such as “and,” “but,” or “so,” among others.Run-on sentencesRun-on sentences, also known as fused sentences, occur when two complete sentences are squashed together without using a coordinating conjunction or proper punctuation, such as a period or a semicolon. Run-on sentences can be short or long. A long sentence isn’t necessarily a run-on sentence.To avoid run-on sentences, see if there is more than one idea communicated by two or more independent clauses. In our examples, there are two complete sentences:Example:Example:Both sentences are complete ideas by themselves; therefore, use a semicolon or a period to indicate that they are separate independent clauses.Using “could of” instead of “could have”“Could have” is always correct; “could of” never is. Writers probably make this grammar gaffe because, when we speak, the contraction “could’ve” sounds an awful lot like “could of.”TautologiesTautologies express the same thing twice with different words. In our example, the word “made” implies that Jack used his own two hands to create the pail. The prepositional phrase “with his own hands” creates a redundancy. Once you know what they are, it’s fun to discover tautologies: dilapidated ruins, close proximity, added bonus, large crowd...The list goes on and on!After reading through this list of common grammatical mistakes, you might be wondering how to remember all these rules as you write.

The juggernaut that is the Chinese economy has created millions on new consumers of the last decade(s). Since the Chinese banking sector is newer and not limited by the legacy technology like the West, it has lead to new and innovative types of consumer payments, the 2 most prominent being AliPay and WeChat. Combined these to services have a 92% market share of Chinese online consumer sales.Any business looking to sell into China needs to be able to accept at least one of these wallets, or they will be losing out. The challenge is that many international payment processors have largely ignored the Tiger Economy. If a merchant wants to integrate to WeChat or AliPay they need to be able to devote technical resources to complex integrations.One solution to that problem comes from BlueSnap (full disclosure, I am happily employed there). With our hosted payment solutions (and soon available via API) we offer a prebuilt integration to AliPay, empowering virtually any merchant to accept it right alongside their credit cards. Combined with built-in acceptance of China Union Pay the solution is an easy and effective way to enter the Chinese market.Another big trend over the past few years (and one of the most problematic) has been cryptocurrency payments. In some ways, it is surprising that crypto still isn’t more widely used. The blockchain is designed to build trust in the security of a transaction, provide a common currency that can be used across borders, and eliminate the friction caused when exchanging funds across international boundaries. That said, the space suffers from a number of shortcomings. The biggest of all is Bitcoin itself. Arguably the first and best known of the Cryptocoins is a good enough store of value (think gold) but was never designed to be transacted like fiat currency (think USD or EUR). Transaction slow, in the range of 7 per second (the Visa network can handle more than 24,000/s) and the value fluctuates against the dollar, making set pricing difficult. Some coins, like Ripple, have been designed to counter these issues; but they are not as widely known. Perhaps the biggest issue facing crypto usage is its rate of adoption. Using a coin requires a little technical knowledge and the industry has a (fading) reputation as the payment choice for the black market.I expect that these problems will be self-resolving over time. Ripple was designed as a faster (and more secure) alternative to the SWIFT interbank transfer system. As more banks start to adopt its usage I feel it will help to further legitimize the space and spur on the development of more consumer-friendly crypto payment options.","5,360 followers",Valerio Cietto,677,2.4K,9.1M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-will-be-the-future-of-social-sciences-humanities-literature-and-liberal-arts-graduates-in-the-world-of-emerging-and-dominating-STEM-Science-Technology-Engineering-and-Mathematics-Will-they-be-able-to-keep-pace
