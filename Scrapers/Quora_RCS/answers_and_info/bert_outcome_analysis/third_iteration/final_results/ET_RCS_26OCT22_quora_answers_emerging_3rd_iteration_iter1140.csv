0,"The OLED is just born as a lighting light. Forget the AMOLEDs that are already in use on smartphone and TV screens. The OLED is a diode that uses organic material ( I can’t say which material we are using ) that produces light by itself. We have already produced lamps for interior lighting, but the powers are still very limited and the cost is very high. They have many advantages over current LEDs such as quality of light, high color resolution, etc. I believe that a few years will have to pass before they can enter the market alongside LEDs.",403 followers,Theo Schmit,3.8K,174,929.3K,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-will-eventually-replace-LED-display
1,"I do not know what might replace LED’s in a macro sense, but IMHO the next major improvement will be in wiring the lighting circuits in homes and businesses for the low voltage DC that LED’s actually use.In (most) cases where high (120–240) AC current is used, the most expensive, least efficient, and highest producer of wasteful heat in an LED bulb, is in the base of the bulb where circuitry exists to convert 120–240 volt AC into the low (usually 6) volt DC that the LED actually uses.This often uses more power than the actual LED chip, and in areas where Air Conditioning is heavily used, one pI do not know what might replace LED’s in a macro sense, but IMHO the next major improvement will be in wiring the lighting circuits in homes and businesses for the low voltage DC that LED’s actually use.In (most) cases where high (120–240) AC current is used, the most expensive, least efficient, and highest producer of wasteful heat in an LED bulb, is in the base of the bulb where circuitry exists to convert 120–240 volt AC into the low (usually 6) volt DC that the LED actually uses.This often uses more power than the actual LED chip, and in areas where Air Conditioning is heavily used, one pays again getting rid of the heat.This will require changes in infra structure, but is a next logical step to improve power efficiency in lighting.Actual replacement of LED’s may b a long way off, because they are already so efficient, that an increment worth the effort would have to be much better and much cheaper.Going from 10% to 90% efficient as in incandescent to LED has a huge immediate payback.LED’s use so much less power per lumen, that even doubling the efficiency will have little actual payback except in some special circumstances.",5 followers,Bill Otto,7.6K,7.5K,43.3M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-will-eventually-replace-LED-display
2,What's the harm in trying?Data science is a big field and has a large array of things you can do. If you have have time definitely give it a try. Bill Gates himself said AI is the next emerging technology and it is directly under data science.But if you don't like it don't push yourself just because it's upcoming and everyone is doing it. Go explore something else. I can give you some ideas here:What's the harm in trying?Data science is a big field and has a large array of things you can do.

9,"My best bet is augmented reality glasses. Right now there are a bunch of start ups doing smart glasses, and also large companies like google and Microsoft that released the google glasses and hololens. But, I think the first mainstream AR glasses that will be widely accepted by consumers might be what Apple is working on right now.All current AR Glasses have something in common: they look ugly. They are very bulky and no one really has the confidence to wear it outside.

Right now there are a bunch of start ups doing smart glasses, and also large companies like google and Microsoft that released the google glasses and hololens. But, I think the first mainstream AR glasses that will be widely accepted by consumers might be what Apple is working on right now.All current AR Glasses have something in common: they look ugly. They are very bulky and no one really has the confidence to wear it outside. They need their own batteries, that will have to carry enough power for a full day and stay slim enough to fit inside the glasses stem. They also need to pack a lot of processing power to render all the graphics and take in all the camera data, and then anchor the graphics to the real world. The only pair of AR glasses that actually has world tracking, allowing you to place objects in the real world and have it anchor to the ground or walls is the hololens, which is probably the bulkiest AR headset on the market. All the other glasses just overlay the information in your field of view, and they stay in a fixed position on the screen. Also, the processor inside must be efficient enough that it generates as little heat as possible, as a hot glasses stem sitting on your ear won’t be comfortable.Inside the stem they will also have to embed bone conducting transducer to direct audio into your ears. The front of the glasses also has to house an array of cameras, which has to be smaller than the cameras found in smartphones, which in turn means that light gathering performance goes down even further. The amount of technology that is required to be packed into the frame is insaneNow, why do I think Apple will be the one to deliver the first commercially successful smart glasses? Because Apple has had a track record of delivering completed products rather than prototypes. They usually aren’t the first, but their products are often the most polished and refined in the industry. While most other companies are making chunky proof of concepts, Apple is possibly trying to make a product that looks as similar to a regular pair of glasses, but with all the augmented reality functions. They already have ARKit on iOS, which I suppose means that it wouldn’t take them too long to port it over to a pair of glasses. All they have left is all the hardware challenges…","45,630 followers",David Seidman,790,3.6K,85.1M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Everyone-today-is-learning-big-data-Hadoop-data-science-Should-I-just-learn-it-because-its-the-next-available-technology-to-work-in-the-future

Cellphones running Android or IOS be fine. Newer ways of working maybe normal. and people want see and get out some. going push the economy, a long. Maybe more tech on MFG and transportation. a big rig. If could have a auto pilot. and humans being checking out trucks could run every hour of the day.
