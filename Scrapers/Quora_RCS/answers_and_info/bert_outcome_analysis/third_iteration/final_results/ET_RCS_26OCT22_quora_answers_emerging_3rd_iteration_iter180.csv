The second is when, in such a place, you decide to play a practical joke.

But sports games are hobbies, not events. There’s a key difference. For instance, see one of our best fields:Quite respectable, full-sized track, well-kept yard, logo, etc. But note the distinct lack of seating? Yeah, we play for fun, but we don’t expect anyone to actually come watch.In my entire time at the Institute, not a single person ever asked me to come watch a single athletic event.4: Lots of NumbersWhat did I study? I was course 6. 6–2 specifically.Favorite class? 6.004 (spoken, six-double-oh-four)Where? Building 32, mostly.The only classes that have names are humanities* (they have numbers too, but it’s obscure enough so that most don’t mention them). The only buildings with names are the dorms (and the student center). I honestly don’t know why this tradition still exists, but it’s tradition.*Excepting some famous ones like Unified.5: Finding a nobel-prize winner teaching your intro class.Actually, my favorite “holy shit” moment was when I took a computer security class, and we were studying RSA. I was skimming through the description when I saw something I didn’t know before:The acronym RSA is made of the initial letters of the names of Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman, its inventors.Hmmm. I thought. That looks familiar.I begin leafing through my notes, trying to figure out where I’d seen that name before. And then it dawned on me. I looked up at the board, in the top left corner, where it had been sitting undisturbed all semester. The professor’s name and contact info.Professor R. Rivest.xxxxx@mit.eduOffice hours: Tuesday, 7pmJaw. Drop.It’s one thing to know that the guy you’re learning from is very well-qualified and excellent in his field.It’s another thing entirely for him to haveEDIT: Yes, I know Rivest doesn’t have a Nobel prize, but this is a better story than the time I had a Nobel prize professor teach my physics class.",53 followers,Nilanjan Debnath,894,0,0,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-kind-of-innovative-ideas-and-technologies-are-being-put-to-the-test-at-the-Massachusetts-Institute-of-Technology-MIT-Media-Lab-the-most-cutting-edge-program-at-arguably-the-world-s-top-technological-research

After all, it had exterminated almost all its native Siberian population, had race-based slavery, changed the terminology from ""colored people"" to ""people of color"" (cause it used to be racist, but now its not), didn't let asians use the same bathroom as white Russians as late as 1960s and still considers race a major part of ones identity.

13,"Unfortunately, where there should be such a thing, the world is not quite lined up that way.If there is such a person who honestly pursues this kind of work without taking advantage of the owner of the patent or intellectual property, I have never met one. I have heard of and come into (brief) contact with dozens of people who troll, bilk, and steal from people who think they have valuable ideas and are looking to license them to big companies. If such a person existed, you would want to pay them a small retainer (say $5,000) to try and 1% to 10% of what they get in eventual licensing fees — sUnfortunately, where there should be such a thing, the world is not quite lined up that way.If there is such a person who honestly pursues this kind of work without taking advantage of the owner of the patent or intellectual property, I have never met one. I have heard of and come into (brief) contact with dozens of people who troll, bilk, and steal from people who think they have valuable ideas and are looking to license them to big companies. If such a person existed, you would want to pay them a small retainer (say $5,000) to try and 1% to 10% of what they get in eventual licensing fees — somewhat like an agent for an actor. And you would only deal with someone who could provide you a dozen or more actual, verifiable references, not just good “stories” of their glory days.What a more typical path looks like is this:You build a prototype of the invention — this could be as a student at a school where students retain some or all rights to their inventions, or on your own. You hire a patent attorney, hopefully one with good references, and you pay by the hour (expect $300–600/hr). This person gets no percentage of the results — they are professionals who get paid well by the hour. Depending on how much coaching you need, the patent filing process takes 1–2 years and $10,000 to $20,000 to file and receive a provisional patent.Now you have a patent, but either no market (so no perceived value to it) or a market that infringes on the patent who don’t know about you. For the no-market case, imagine an invention that retrieves frisbees off of roofs in a new way with magnets. There is no indication that the world needs such a thing, but you might be able to patent it (no, I didn’t do the search to see, I just made that up). For the other case, you approach companies that either need your invention or are infringing and you offer to license your rights. There are people with experience doing this — but not really any honest brokers. Generally you have to start a company and hire people with licensing expertise and/or intellectual property law expertise. Big companies will almost always challenge the patent and you need to defend it in court. Or they may be interested in buying out the patent because they want to defend it in court themselves and go after OTHER big companies.The road is never easy and it is almost impossible to turn it over to someone else. The companies that offer to “help” end up selling you the information I just gave you for $1000 to $3000 and all you do is find out it is hard.There are big winners — and everyone I know of who won on this path worked on it for years, mostly full time. And I know of many who had their patents invalidated during the process. All the big company has to do is find someone, somewhere who built something enough similar to yours with a date preceding your proof-of-first.Good luck - inventing is important and valuable — but winning isn’t as simple as a license deal.","58,986 followers",Michael Wolfe,504,2K,17.3M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-kind-of-innovative-ideas-and-technologies-are-being-put-to-the-test-at-the-Massachusetts-Institute-of-Technology-MIT-Media-Lab-the-most-cutting-edge-program-at-arguably-the-world-s-top-technological-research
