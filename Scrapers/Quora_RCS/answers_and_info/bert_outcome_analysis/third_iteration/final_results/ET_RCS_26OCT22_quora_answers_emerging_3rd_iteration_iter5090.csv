0,"Yes, absolutely.I have already created online courses and know of dozens of students who have worked through the materials and learned the topic. In some sense, I did nothing for them and learned completely without me even knowing they were learning. This is not even a robot and the students are learning. There are online learning systems that can even answer your questions automatically. Let AI evolve a bit more and I can easily see this happening.","105,669 followers",Dave Consiglio,953,6.8K,91.6M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Can-teaching-machines-replace-teachers
1,"Never…ever.Not now, not in a hundred years.Think about it this way : Suppose you break a leg and are admitted at a hospital. Would you want to be cared for by a lifeless robot who is programmed to “take care of you” or an actual human being with all the responses of a living, conscious person able to acknowledge you are in pain and show sympathy in a warm, gestured manner.Similarly, imagine having your children being taught by a robot. Wouldn't it be safe to assume that to some degree, they could adopt the lifeless, cold “persona”of a robot?Kids learn a lot from teachers, especially pre-teenagNever…ever.Not now, not in a hundred years.Think about it this way : Suppose you break a leg and are admitted at a hospital.

Wouldn't it be safe to assume that to some degree, they could adopt the lifeless, cold “persona”of a robot?Kids learn a lot from teachers, especially pre-teenagers and it’s those warm-hearted teachers which sometimes provides the right impetus to spur a student on, or listen to their domestic sorrows.Teachers do not get enough credit as it is, could you imagine the impact of introducing robot teachers into society? I believe it may have a few Pros, a FEW. But the cons far outweigh any PROs that can be argued in favor of having robot teachers.So, to answer your question, we CAN have robots as teachers ( it will be highly impractical and DE-motivating for students) but we SHOULD not replace teachers with robots.",36 followers,Adam Ambrozy,579,0,0,2018,https://www.quora.com/Can-teaching-machines-replace-teachers
2,"It depends on the subject, the preparation and ability of the student, and the context. It also depends on the capabilities of the automaton doing the teaching.Some people are able to learn some skills totally from books. Putting some automaton in place of the books wouldn’t change that, and the person would learn.The issue comes when one tries to generalize this across all topics & students. We are far from the point where most students & subjects could be taught by non-human entities.","90,361 followers",Alisha Talks,728,910,103.9M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Can-teaching-machines-replace-teachers
