Is there something underlying, unifying, such as string theory? (But if so, we need to make string theory into a true theory, and not just a hypothesis.)Is it possible to have superconductors that operate at room temperature?

3,Your question details reveal an assumption which is insupportable.  Two of them actually.Neither Radio nor the Internal Combustion Engine were 'completely new' technologies that never existed before.  They were concepts that grew out of previous technologies.All modern technologies emerged from work done on the technologies which preceded them and the printed circuitry and other high-end electronics that go into your despised laptops and smartphones was more revolutionary (in it's introduction) than Internal Combustion.,UNKNOWN,Joshua P.

5,I do think aquaponics is quite a new way of farming. Aquaponics uses fish in combination with plants.This is how it works:The fish waste (ammonia and solids) gets converted by bacteria to nitrites and then nitrates in a biofilter. Plants (especially leafy vegetables) need these nitrates to grow.Aquaponics is the combination of aquaculture (producing fish) with hydroponics (growing plants in nutrient-rich water).,"68,802 followers",Kanthaswamy Balasubramaniam,2.2K,17.3K,413.7M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-newest-emerging-science-and-technology-fields
6,"No at least i doubt it. Technology habits can make a big difference though. You are what you eat. Every choice you make with what to look at on your phone? Can impact your mood. But if you are addicted to scrolling, being liked on social media etc? There are real easy ways to filter negative inputs and replace them with positive. You control your feed to a large degree.

Only browse news if you can be mindful about how you do it. If you feel isolated, lonely? Go volunteer somewhere and get with some people face to face. It is a different experience than chatting with someone on the phone. My sense is we are all sort of shutting down and focusing inward. Because we think we can stay in touch even if we never see people. It’s hard to do. People prefer fewer words for everything. Long emails are a burden. Send me a text and the word “ok” has gotten to long for us. Now it’s just “k”. Give yourself time to enjoy the small things in life. A decent meal with family. A book. A walk. Our sedentary lives are just not great exercise for the mind. Too much going on to even pay attention about “what”.","1,000 followers",Ruben Kusi,3.1K,165,2.2M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-newest-emerging-science-and-technology-fields
7,Technology has been with us since we learned to tame fire and invented the wheel. It is nothing new. What is new is how rapidly it has advanced in the last 100 years and how horrific the consequences have been to the human race and the planet in that explosive action.The most horrific is how it has been able to grasp men’s minds and enslave them to ideas that serve only the manipulators of that technology. They teach us that contentment is contemptible and that we must forever reach for newer and better things and discard as pure rubbish all that has preceded us.They enslave our minds to be foTechnology has been with us since we learned to tame fire and invented the wheel.

They teach us that contentment is contemptible and that we must forever reach for newer and better things and discard as pure rubbish all that has preceded us.They enslave our minds to be forever dissatisfied and discontent. They convince us that constant stimulation is what living is all about. They carve a path of destruction in what is and tell us what it should be and convince us that it is in our best interest. All this is going on at such a fast pace that the mind cannot adjust and suffers from burn out and confusion.They feed us garbage and tell us how good it is for us. The liars and manipulators are in control.One could write a ten page list of how technology has helped us and hindered us in our progress. It is going to take some time for us to sort through the whole process and see what falls under which column.We live in interesting times and it causes me to wonder where it is all leading to and if we will survive it all.

8,"All! Maybe not all. Certainly many.The time that young people are spending engaged with their screens, computer, telephone, television, takes them out of social activities and activities that would promote more significant personal development, resulting in better social skills, better ability to focus, acquisition of skills (Playing a musical instrument, learning a new language, extracurricular activities, etc).

Research shows that when people engage in passive watching activities, the left brain goes dormant similar to the left brain of an infant. A black out of thinking! No wonder we have people with an inability to focus, chronic ADHD, having grown up on TV and electronics. The ‘muscle’ is weak!Who handwrites anymore? Practising handwriting was one of the fine motor skills that helped people cultivate focus and achieve more synchronized brain function. Reading books promotes deep thinking but electronic media wires us for shallow thinking, promoting impatience. Who will patiently sit and read a book? the result: weak cognitive processing, more learning difficulties, less discipline, short attention span, more emotional reactivity and immaturity because stronger cognitive processing as well as better discipline and structure mediate emotions and neurosis. More people will emerge into adulthood with a lack of maturity and weakened abilities on many levels. With less ability to perform well (on many levels) expect less thriving, more addiction as a means to cope, more reactivity, less success in intimate relationships, more anger management problems, a tendency to succumb to stress and experience health problems as a result, etc, etc.","9,928 followers",Amie Greenaway,972,1.8K,17.6M,2019,https://www.quora.com/How-does-Emerging-Technologies-influence-market-Place-Volatility
9,"Greetings Steve,Some people are using technology as fuel or methods to alleviate their issues.Some issues are caused or reinforced by social media, some by depicting more and more graphic violence in sexual relationships, and some mental health issues are caused by the pressure created by a society requiring you to compete with each other and computerized machines.

11,"I would say the exact opposite. Technology, particularly social media, has contributed to the decline in personal contacts and the support that these provide to individuals.
