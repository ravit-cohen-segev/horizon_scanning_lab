1,"IndianCulture is something vibrant, dynamic, throbbing, thriving, changing, mutating, deviating...all the time.If we had tried to protect the status quo, we wouldn't have had things like the Hindi/Urdu language, the harmonium or the sitar, Tamil wouldn't have borrowed from Sanskrit and vice versa, there would have been no mixing of tradition and rituals picked up from other cultures and absorbed into our own.Culture doesn't need protection!

Culture needs practice.Practice the bits of tradition from your (or another!) culture that appeal to you! So many non-Punjabis now wear the red-and-whiteIndians take on things they like from western cultures too, like the practice of saying vows to their betrothed at a wedding function. Surely, this was something worth emulating. In that sense, culture is about giving humans joy and happiness, binding them with art, music language, emotion and nostalgia - a celebration of the human condition.Taking on new practices and continuing old ones that appeal to us will be the contribution we make to our collective legacy and pass it on to future generations.Most of all, stop thinking of culture as your own and stop thinking of it as an endangered or threatened species.Indian",1 follower,Tushar Ahir,33.9K,105,5.9M,2015,https://www.quora.com/India-What-are-the-leading-technologies-emerging-out-of-India-or-where-Indians-have-played-or-are-playing-a-significant-part

Below is the full video on YoutubeHowever one important part stood out for me is where Raghuram Rajan says this and I quoteThe worst mistake we can make is to think we can be like China . We cant be like China for the simple reason is that their system is not our system . Their lack of democracy, their lack of debate have worked for them to create a manufacturing superpower. We will be shadow of them if we try walking the same way. We need our own system, a system which relies on what our strengths are India‚Äôs key strengths are her democracy, debate and diversity, and she must adopt a strategy suited to her strengths.You can watch the last 5 minutes of the video for reference.",697 followers,Vshal Shiv√¢,4.8K,98,1.5M,2022,https://www.quora.com/India-What-are-the-leading-technologies-emerging-out-of-India-or-where-Indians-have-played-or-are-playing-a-significant-part

6,"Before answering this question, I would split the question into two. By splitting the question I get a frame of reference and then the answer becomes fairly straight forward to comprehendThe answer to the first question is straight forward and India is much advanced compared to where we were in 2000.

By splitting the question I get a frame of reference and then the answer becomes fairly straight forward to comprehendThe answer to the first question is straight forward and India is much advanced compared to where we were in 2000. I am not going to elaborate this further because its for us to see. But should we be happy about it? That leads us to my second questionWhile it is true that India has advanced immensely in the last 20 years, the real question is has this made us more dependent on other countries? Most notably the United States and recently China?Despite having a population of 1.3 billion people and being touted as the software superpower (thanks to the IT services industry) not so long ago, India does not have self-reliance when it comes to technology. China created companies like Ali Baba, Baidu and Tencent a parallel to the American tech giants while India (even India‚Äôs telecom minister recently) takes pride in being the largest consumer of Whatsapp, and Facebook! Yes almost everyone has a mobile phone in India today and therefore the opportunities for growth is tremendous. But the real question one should ask is, who will be the beneficiaries of these opportunities? The mobile phones used in India are Chinese phones and the software used in these phones are U.S owned. Basically all our data, from our shopping habits to our entertainment preferences are in the hands of foreign technology companies. Now we know IoT is catching up fast and that means more control to these companies and India will be a proud consumer supplying data.One of the many important aspects discussed in Rajiv Malhotra‚Äôs latest book ‚ÄúArtificial Intelligence and the Future of Power, Five Battlegrounds‚Äù is India‚Äôs military dependence on foreign technology. While the manufacturing of Rafale jets will happen in India, the technology is owned by the French and let‚Äôs understand when such technology transfers occur between countries, the supplying country will always provide a technology that is one generation behind to the consuming country. That means we are technologically and militarily advanced compared to our previous generations but we are at least one generation behind the innovating countries! In certain areas like military that is not good newsMy last point on this is our pride in our Human resource and how skilled we are! Yes as individuals many Indians are CEOs of big foreign tech giants. But how does that benefit India as a nation? Do we have a stake in the intellectual property of these products? Can we say for instance Sunder Pichai as Google‚Äôs CEO holds the same clout in his company as Mark Zuckerberg holds in Facebook? Certainly not! Let‚Äôs not confuse individual brilliance with technological advancement as nation.For India to have a grand standing in the world stage as a technologically advanced nation, we need to come out of our consumer mindset and to quote Rajiv Malhotra‚Äôs words ‚Äúbe producers of knowledge and technology‚Äù.","3,754 followers",Venkateshwar Jayakanth,9.7K,0,0,2021,https://www.quora.com/India-What-are-the-leading-technologies-emerging-out-of-India-or-where-Indians-have-played-or-are-playing-a-significant-part

Early in the 1800s, Japan was an isolationist feudal state ruled by the Tokugawa family as a military dictatorship. Then foreign pressure forced Japan to open its doors to trade, which caused a LOT of economic and social strife that led to a civil war called the Bakumatsu. Afterward, Japan rapidly modernized, basically going from (using the British monarchical system) the time of Queen Elizabeth to Queen Victoria.

12,"Absolutely. If we lived in a more perfect world, it would be nice to see those resources diverted to peaceful technologies, but as it is, military strength is the last word in international politics.
