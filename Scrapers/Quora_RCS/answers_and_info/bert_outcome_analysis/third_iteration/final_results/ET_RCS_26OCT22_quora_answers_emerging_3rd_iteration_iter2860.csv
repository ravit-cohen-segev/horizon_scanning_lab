Just that is visible in the archaeological record as a significant and relatively sudden change.And that’s nothing compared to what our own industrial society has been doing over the course of the past century or so. Things like leaded gasoline, the massive use of fossil fuels, and our toying with atomic energy has left all kinds of easily detectable chemical traces all over the planet. We routinely cut through hills to build roadways. We tear down entire mountains to mine for coal and minerals. We alter the courses of rivers and use dams to make new lakes. And we produce massive garbage dumps full of the broken and discarded products of our technological society with plastics, weird alloys from discarded electronics, and all kinds of other chemicals not found in nature. The changes we make to the environment are profound.So, then, how is all of that going away without a trace? It’s not. It can’t.

The Coopers who failed ended up making “dry barrels” that only held produce or things that wouldn’t spoil. There are very few people who know how to make a barrel today. Even Jack Daniels, the biggest barrel maker in the world, uses an automated process now because making them by hand is too slow. The art of coopering is dying. There are very, very few people who know how to make a barrel left in the world and fewer every year, yet barrel making was an advanced technology that changed the entire world for literally thousands of years.Incidentally. the most prolific barrel in the world today is the ASB or American Standard Barrel that hold 53 gallons because America makes more barrels than anyone else in the world. Many used Jack Daniels barrels are re-used to make other kinds of liquor in other parts of the world.Do you know who the highest paid man in the community was in “ancient times”? It was the Wheelwright.Making a wheel from wood with an axle that attaches to a cart and doesn’t fall apart within a mile or two is one of the most “advanced technologies” of all time. Without it, most civilizations would have failed or failed to spread. Cart wheels are complex and the forces must play against each other continuously to hold the wheel together as it rolls. A Cartwright made as much then as a jet airline pilot back does today. In the 1880s when the average wage was $1.50 a day, the Wheelwright was making 90 dollars a week. On the Mayflower they brought one single cart over to America and it was the most valuable thing on the ship manifest, worth more than 10 times the next most valuable thing on the ship. Can you make a cartwheel?

Its root is “civil”, “civility”: courteous behavior toward others. In that sense, civilization is not linked to technology, only to personal interaction, to a society of people who behave with consideration and politeness toward one another. A society of such people, civil and civilized, would have a high civilization even if they lived in caves and hunted for their food.If one equates possession of “advanced technology” and its associated gadgetry, including means of mass destruction and murder with “civilization”, then a society of such people may be neither civil nor civilized, as possession of technology is an independent aspect that has nothing to do with attitude or behavior, only with knowledge and exploitation of science. Whether such people had ”culture”, as exemplified for instance by forms of art (music, painting, etc.), or “humanity” as in compassionate, respectful personal interactions, that would depend on their having “civilization” as in its initially defined meaning.Indeed, as one considers our current state of the world and its history, technology has had, on the whole, a negative impact on culture, humanity, civilization (as in “civility”) because, in general, technology has been exploited by governance, as well as other institutions and even individuals, for increased control, dominance, acquisition, repression, murder, all of which are adverse to culture and “humanity”. Technology of iron enabled Hittite conquest of ancient Egypt, and technology advanced in relation to another had enabled similar conquests and displacements, by commercial or military means, throughout history. We see it even now, in the war in Ukraine, a conflict waged under the poised “sword” and threat of nuclear weaponry, without any semblance of culture, humanity, or “civilization”. A conflict as indicative of our own standing in “civilization” as that of any cannibal society, because while we may not literally eat our enemies, we certainly seem capable of generating those enemies and, if we can, if we have the advanced technology, of murdering them.In sum, “What are the effects of civilization and advanced technology on culture and humanity?”, the effects of advanced technology on culture and humanity seem to be adverse ones, reducing the opportunity for extending cultural behavior while diminishing that appropriate to “humanity” and maintenance of “civilization”. But in the end technology, advanced or not, is merely a tool, and a tool does nothing than other than what its user intends. So what advanced technology does is merely en expression of what we, humans, want. As it is, we seem to want to destroy ourselves, and technology is helping us to do so in many ways, not just with weaponry. If we want to survive, if humanity wants to survive, then we must change ourselves, our failed socio-politico0economic systems that utilize technology to destroy us, and then we will be able to use technology for our preservation, for benefit, for continuing the survival of ourselves, of humanity. Our choice, to die, or survive.","5,990 followers",Jens Böttiger,566,2.6K,17.6M,2022,https://www.quora.com/What-would-happen-if-you-went-back-in-time-and-gave-the-ancient-Romans-advanced-technology

I had diagnosed chronic depression, anxiety, insomnia, and I was perpetually miserable.But, for some reason, for some unbelievable reason, I was drawn to him that morning.I had to ask him what was wrong. If everything was okay. If he was well.I walked up to him, and said, “Bhaiya, what's wrong?”His eyes.There was something about them. They were eyes I'd seen before — eyes that'd look back at me every time I'd look in the mirror.Eyes that had no trace of hope in them. Eyes that only the broken and beaten carry.He just cried without a single word.I walked inside his auto and I sat down.I gave him some time. He needed me there but he just didn't want to trouble me.I waited for what felt like an eternity, and then he finally told me, “I don't want to live anymore. I'm going to kill myself today. You're the last person I'm talking to.”I said nothing but motioned for him to pass me the bottle of alcohol.Then I took a long drink, and told him to turn the auto to the liquor shop.Four hours — I was with him for four hours that day.I'd drink and he'd drink and he'd tell me about his life.He'd lived a miserable existence. His story makes me tear up even today, this moment, as I write this.The one person — the only person who could see past this lonely alcoholic auto driver that the world could see — to come to love him — recently died.His heart — was shredded to bits. There was nothing he had that he could live for. He'd made his decision.He was going to kill himself.Those four hours passed by in a second.I barely said a word.One bottle of rum after another was opened and we drank — then we got more — and drank more.Words came out of him — one after another — until his chest started to feel less and less heavy with each passing second.My friends walked by and saw me sit in a auto with a lowly auto-driver and drink and they gave me the same look the world gave him.I just didn't leave. I couldn't bring myself to.I was fixated on him — and I didn't know how — but I had to help him somehow.Four hours later, he wiped his tears and said, “Now I'm going to live for you. You saved my life.”That night as I went home drunk out of my mind after saying goodbye, I puked.Then I cried, drank the last of the alcohol I had, and then I puked again to pass out on the floor in a sea of tears and puke.I missed my exam the next morning.One year later, one lonely, miserable night I'd try to kill myself.My best friend would call him because she just didn't know what else to do. She was helpless and she couldn't trust my friends to see me like this.She called him, and he begged to talk to me and I said, “No, bhaiya. This is it. Goodbye.”Seconds passed....then minutes....and the bell rang and my best friend ran to the door because she was afraid to leave me alone.There he stood.Not many people know this, but that night he was there.Fighting with me. Crying with me. Begging me. Asking me to choose to live. He begged, literally begged.He told me, as I couldn't keep my eyes open, that I was the reason he was alive — he just couldn't let me do it.He'd not be able to live with himself.He had a huge part to play as to why I'm alive today.There's something I didn't know that night.When my best friend called him, he was having dinner.Just as soon as he heard that I was going to kill myself, he left his dinner, and he stole his father's auto keys since his had no fuel.His father saw him, and thinking he was going to drink again, he tried to snatch the keys away from him, for them to fight.Yes, they fought.Then, along the way, he'd drive so fast that he'd crash into the divider some distance away from my house.There was a huge dent in his auto that night.He risked his life — and he lived miles away from me.To give you an accurate example, he reached my home within nine minutes — a distance that is almost impossible to cover on any given night.That's how fast he drove.Then, he was here.At my door.To fight for me, with me.A lonely auto driver who I'd spent four hours with on the day he wanted to kill himself.What's the closest thing to magic that actually exists?Kindness — how it magically makes its way back to you.",3 followers,Mark Bradford,12.8K,579,2.5M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Is-it-possible-that-instead-of-advancing-technologically-the-world-went-back-to-the-ancient-ages-instead

I remember feeling that she was right and the US was wrong to go after Osama.I disliked christianity and I believed the only truth was Islam. I understood the difference between the 'christian Jesus version' and the 'muslim Jesus version' and I only respected the latter.My parents enrolled me in a christian school that was within their budget. They felt it was safer because i'm a smallie-frame muslim boy who would be bullied by anti-muslims and 'anti-religious' kids {in their mind}It was this school that taught me many things about christianity. I also knew a little about christianity from my maternal grandmother who was a full gospel christian. But I was also taught by my own parents that nannii (grandmother) was a Kafir (an unbeliever)My first week at my school, I experienced my first christian service. I felt very uncomfortable. I didnt like it. They were singing so loud and clapping while singing. Something very strange for me. But it became stranger. They were praising the name of Jesus in a way that I never witnessed before. I felt shocked and I thought they would all burn in hell for praising Jesus like this.When I started to learn about christianity, that's when I realized I needed to learn more about Islam. I kept learning things about Jesus that I embrace but I would try to find it in Islam and I became confused. I was becoming angry that Jesus has no faults and i'm angry that Muhammad's history is different and my entire religion is based on his teachings.Why I believed in Jesus?Eventually I fell in love with Jesus and hated the life of Muhammad. I reached a point when I said to myself,  ""why are so many muslims following Muhammad?""Jesus was so tender and innocent. He never sinned. Muhammad sinned, and many times. Jesus never forced anyone to follow him. Jesus never killed and caused wars to spread his message. Muhammad killed people in the name of God to spread his message. I cannot serve a God that will allow his messenger to kill so many people. Jesus never owned a slave. He was never married and he performed miracles. Muhammad never did any of that. Jesus never said to kill unbelievers. Muhammad said that. Jesus never took wealth from people by force but Muhammad did.Before gaining vast knowledge about christianity, I had already lost faith in Islam. I had already knew enough about Jesus to believe He is a saviour and He is the King of Kings and the Lord of Lords. I was convinced that His message was the truth and I wanted to followI made a right decision to serve Jesus. He is not dead. He lives and He sets the captives free. His name is powerful. When I say His name with authority, the forces of darkness must obey. His name has dominion and power over every evil. He is the King of Kings and the Lord of Lords.My Parents' Reaction:Naanii (grandmother) was the first person I confided in. She told me whenever I'm ready I should tell my parents. But I was never ready. She told me the day I felt ready, I must pray and ask God to soften their hearts with understanding and wisdom.When I finally told my parents, I felt sad. They did not try to change me or fight, but they just showed disappointed. My mom just walked away. My dad said he cannot force me to follow the religion but he didn't wantMy 2nd BreakthroughMy grandmother used to work part time as an Avon lady in Queens, NY. A few summers ago she used all her savings to take me with her for a short vacation to Trinidad (a Caribbean island) She had a friend there from her previous job.While in San Fernando, Trinidad, we attended a Crusade. My first ever Crusade. It was the largest christian gathering I have ever seen. It looked like a Lincoln Park rock concert. I was shocked. My heart felt so proud to serve Jesus when I saw this crowd.A memory I will never forget, as we entered, I could just see thousands of people they were singing ""Majesty worship his majesty, unto Jesus, be all glory, honor and praise..."" over and over again... In all my life, I NEVER, EVER saw any muslims in large numbers sing like this to Allah....

22,"The latest technology is to have a card, and some way to authorize the use of that card.Usually whatever authorization method they use is not very secure.For example, for the chip and PIN systems from Europe, which are supposed to be secure, there are at last 16 ways to subvert them.One of these is a called a “pre-play attack”.When the chip and PIN systems started making the checkouts at Safeway stores in California start taking a significantly longer time, which would mean they’d get backed up, and might end up having to hire more cashiers, Safeway built the pre-play attack into their card auThe latest technology is to have a card, and some way to authorize the use of that card.Usually whatever authorization method they use is not very secure.For example, for the chip and PIN systems from Europe, which are supposed to be secure, there are at last 16 ways to subvert them.One of these is a called a “pre-play attack”.When the chip and PIN systems started making the checkouts at Safeway stores in California start taking a significantly longer time, which would mean they’d get backed up, and might end up having to hire more cashiers, Safeway built the pre-play attack into their card authorization machines at the check stand.You need to stop and think a second about that.When Safeway determined that there was a conflict between security and ease of use, they made the trade-off in favor of ease of use (and hiring fewer cashiers).Under Bill Clinton, there was a credit reform act passed.Among other things, it meant that the responsibility for credit card losses was shifted from the credit card company to the merchant.This phased in as soon as the supposedly “more secure” technology phased in.In most places, they do not require a signature for credit cards — even credit cards designated “chip and signature” to avoid the pre-play attack of “chip and PIN” — for very, very large amounts of money.It used to be $10, and then it was $25, then it was $50.I was informed by a merchant the other day that they do not require a signature on amounts under $200 (!). That’s insane.As soon as most debit cards turned into credit cards — you can get a debit card without the “VISA” or other credit card company dong the collections, but you have to shop around, and it’s mostly only credit unions offering them — those rules also applied to debit cards.And because they were able to engage in this cost-shifting, they were fine with the technology being less secure.And so it is.Bank checks have not gone away because there are some people who are simply not willing to take credit cards, or credit card company backed debit cards.Landlords are an example.If I’m a landlord (I am, actually), I’d have to be an utter moron to accept credit card, debit card-with-logo, or practically any other form of electronic payment.Because you could pay your deposit on a card, then pay the first and second months rent on a card.And then, when it came time to pay the third month’s rent, you could have trashed the place, be long gone, and dispute the card charges.And I’d have to eat all that.Or…You could be evicted, but because I can’t stop you sending me money, the law in California means that if I accept the money, I am accepting it as full payment.So if I start an eviction proceeding, and the payment comes in? I’ve accepted payment, and the court dismisses the eviction proceeding — you are practically eviction-proof.If I try to charge to a fee for something, like destroying a built-in microwave, or flushing disposable diapers down the toilet and causing a flood, and the payment comes in? I’ve accepted payment, which renders it payment in full, which renders the fee forgiven.You can damn well be certain that there are some things for which I will only accept a bank check, and you can stuff your card … some place uncomfortable.",256 followers,Priyal Gupta,9.7K,0,0,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-would-happen-if-you-went-back-in-time-and-gave-the-ancient-Romans-advanced-technology
23,"Before answering this question, I would split the question into two.

By splitting the question I get a frame of reference and then the answer becomes fairly straight forward to comprehendThe answer to the first question is straight forward and India is much advanced compared to where we were in 2000. I am not going to elaborate this further because its for us to see. But should we be happy about it? That leads us to my second questionWhile it is true that India has advanced immensely in the last 20 years, the real question is has this made us more dependent on other countries? Most notably the United States and recently China?Despite having a population of 1.3 billion people and being touted as the software superpower (thanks to the IT services industry) not so long ago, India does not have self-reliance when it comes to technology. China created companies like Ali Baba, Baidu and Tencent a parallel to the American tech giants while India (even India’s telecom minister recently) takes pride in being the largest consumer of Whatsapp, and Facebook! Yes almost everyone has a mobile phone in India today and therefore the opportunities for growth is tremendous. But the real question one should ask is, who will be the beneficiaries of these opportunities? The mobile phones used in India are Chinese phones and the software used in these phones are U.S owned. Basically all our data, from our shopping habits to our entertainment preferences are in the hands of foreign technology companies. Now we know IoT is catching up fast and that means more control to these companies and India will be a proud consumer supplying data.One of the many important aspects discussed in Rajiv Malhotra’s latest book “Artificial Intelligence and the Future of Power, Five Battlegrounds” is India’s military dependence on foreign technology. While the manufacturing of Rafale jets will happen in India, the technology is owned by the French and let’s understand when such technology transfers occur between countries, the supplying country will always provide a technology that is one generation behind to the consuming country. That means we are technologically and militarily advanced compared to our previous generations but we are at least one generation behind the innovating countries! In certain areas like military that is not good newsMy last point on this is our pride in our Human resource and how skilled we are! Yes as individuals many Indians are CEOs of big foreign tech giants. But how does that benefit India as a nation? Do we have a stake in the intellectual property of these products? Can we say for instance Sunder Pichai as Google’s CEO holds the same clout in his company as Mark Zuckerberg holds in Facebook? Certainly not! Let’s not confuse individual brilliance with technological advancement as nation.For India to have a grand standing in the world stage as a technologically advanced nation, we need to come out of our consumer mindset and to quote Rajiv Malhotra’s words “be producers of knowledge and technology”.","5,990 followers",Jens Böttiger,566,2.6K,17.6M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-would-happen-if-you-went-back-in-time-and-gave-the-ancient-Romans-advanced-technology
24,"The current leader in space technology is…… not a country.It’s corporations.First of all, the United States has always used private corporations to build their government sponsored rockets, so even the Saturn V that went to the moon was built by corporations.

So, in the 1960’s and 1970’s, the U.S. had leadership, but only through their corporations.The Space Shuttle was the follow up to the Saturn V, and it led the world in technology for the 80’s and 90’s, except for the single launch of the Buran, which arguably was a superior vehicle, albeit one which the faltering Soviet Union couldn’t afford to maintain.And then in 2011, the Shuttle era came to an end.And, almost without anyone noticing, Russia simply inherited the title.Not through innovation. Lord knows the Soyuz and Progress rockets were both designed in the 1960’s, based on modified R7 rockets initial built from the captured V2 rockets built by the Third Reich in the mid-40’s.To this day, the Soyuz is still launchedThat’s not what I’d call “space-age technology.”The U.S. government, with the end of the shuttle, pushed for the reuse of all the parts used to make the shuttle for the new replacement Constellation program. A program that even the most optimistic estimates put at launching in the 2020’s at a cost of over $40So, Constellation was canceled, except for the Orion capsule. And then they pushed the SLS instead, still re-using the parts of the 1960’s designed Space Shuttle (along with updates from the 90’s and early 2000’s).SLS has now burned through at least $12So, China started developing space flight, and they’ve successfully put astronauts and even two space stations into orbit. But calling them advanced would ignore the fact that they have, almost bolt for bolt, copied the Russian Soyuz capsule and the Progress rocket with its horribly poisonous UDMH and N2O4 hypergolic fuel. Even Russia is retiring that sad old dinosaur.In fact, a lot of the current batch of decades-old rockets are being retired.Why?Because of two corporations. One of them is very public, and one is very secretive, but both of them have taken the Aerospace industry and shaken it to its absolute core.The public one is SpaceX, the private one is Blue Origin. Both of them went out and did what everyone said was impossible. They built new engines from scratch with new technology, put them into new rockets built from scratch with new technology, and launched them.But, more importantly, they landed them.You see, other than one part of one rocket, the shuttle orbiter, no other rocket has ever landed before. (Yes, they re-used the boosters too, but the price of refurbishing them after a dip in the ocean was arguably higher than just building them over every time, and they had to be shipped back to Utah to be refurbished anyway. If you have to take something apart down to parts, swap out half the parts, and then rebuild it — is itSo, this has scared the entire launch industry, worldwide, out of their socks.SpaceX is talking about reusing a Block 5 booster within 24 hours. They’re working on BFR, which they claim can be reused as quickly as you can refuel it.Blue Origins’ New Shepard is a bit of a hobby rocket for sightseers, but it proved out BO’s ability to land a rocket and reuse it. New Glenn is a super-heavy lifter that has yet to fly, but will have the same reusability as a SpaceX Falcon 9.And they’re not stopping there. SpaceX is already on the brink of recovering cargo fairings, which would save them $6M per flight, and they’re about to test second stage recovery, which would mean the entire consumables from a flight would basically reduce to the fuel, and a few plastic covers, a compression ring on the second stage engine bell, and a small amount of ablative heat shielding.We already know that the cost per flight for those goods is under a million dollars.We know the full cost of a Falcon 9 flown in expendable mode, is $63 million.If SpaceX can really refly a rocket 100 times, then your amortized cost per flight drops under $2M. To put 30 tons into orbit. That’s $66 per kilogram to orbit.Current spaceflight averages are in the $20,000 per kilogram to orbit. That means a 300x difference in cost.That’s not just a “leader” in space technology, that’s utterly disruptive to the whole industry.Spending $66 a kilo to put something into orbit is about three times the cost FedEx charges to ship a package overnight. Now you can get to orbit for three times the cost of sending cookies across the country as a care package. That’s going to open whole new industries in space.And no other country is close. Russia is claiming their new Angara rocket will be reusable, but they have yet to build even one.The traditional US companies are claiming Vulcan will be reusable, but they have yet to build even one, and they’re asking for $5 billion in research funding from the Air Force to build it.China is making noise about a fully reusable craft, but as I pointed out, their launch vehicle is based around the same technology that Russia has been using since the 1960’s, and they’ve taken to dropping first stages onto populated cities, which is not exactly going to be helping with national pride.The only competition for SpaceX right now is New Glenn, and that has yet to fly.In fact, their closest competitor might very well be……SpaceX.Their next rocket, the BFR (BigNo one else, no government, no nation, is even close to that.So, yeah, the leader in space right now — it’s a corporation, not a company.Honorable mentions: Rocket Lab is getting ready to send “It’s Business Time” — their latest Electron rocket — into space carrying several hundred kilos of cube-sats into orbit. They’re doing this for $7M a launch (estimated) which is still in line with the $20,000 per kilo launch price, but very few other services cater to micro-sat launches yet, so this is a way to get your own, personal cube-sat into orbit for less than the price of a new car.There’s also about a dozen other companies that are following in Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos’ footsteps and starting private launch companies. The whole industry has been re-invigorated.","5,360 followers",Valerio Cietto,677,2.4K,9.1M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Is-it-possible-that-instead-of-advancing-technologically-the-world-went-back-to-the-ancient-ages-instead
