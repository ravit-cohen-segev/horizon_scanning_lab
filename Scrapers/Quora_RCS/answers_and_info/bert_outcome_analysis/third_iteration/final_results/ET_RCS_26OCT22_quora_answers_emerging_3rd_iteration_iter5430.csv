With Nearmap, you can visualize all of that using different forms of imagery. You can measure with precision and use our imagery to “model” your next project.Government - Many of the same issues are at play. Often, governments work within a ecosystem that includes engineering and construction companies. Almost all of these organizations need up to date imagery. They need to see how the landscape has changed over time. They need to communicate with citizens who want to better understand how their city is developing. Many of these governments use imagery inside new information products used to educate and inform the community.Utilities - I’ll include water districts and sewer districts in this use case. Imagine you’re interested in water run off, the impact it has on sewers and nearby lakes and tributaries. You’re likely to want to calculate the amount of water run off based on hard surfaces and roof area. Nearmap allows you to do that with precision and plan for change. As impervious surface areas change, as new construction takes place, new measurements are needed. Water districts are also involved in measuring drought conditions, growth of crops and much more. Let’s talk about Telco and the movement to 5G wireless for a moment. Lower level transmission of wireless signals is dependent on a clear connections. Understanding how to plan for the placement of hardware needed for signal transmission is essential. Digital Surface Models (a type of 3D created from our captures) shows elevation of every point and is therefore useful here.Solar - As the world becomes more focused on renewable energy, solar design has become a very important topic. To efficiently design solar panel implementations, users need imagery - both vertical and oblique (angled perspective) to place panels in a way that optimizes solar power generation while avoiding roof obstructions.We could go on an on with these examples.

Silbevögel was a German project similar to space shuttle with only a small difference in payload.. Bombs instead of sattelites. Given the effort they put on V-2 rocket programme and Peenemünde rocket research facilities (comparable to Manhattan project) with 10 years more they would probably went that way. They were already working on a manned version of V-2.But with his distaste of judenphysik Adolf betted on the wrong horse. Atomic bomb was the way. Considering atomic age hype of the 50ies, One can only imagine what sorts of nuclear tech would put on the frontlines (given Axis didn’t surrendered after few nuclear explosions over Berlin etc.).Meet Ford Nucleon, Less fancy versions could have brought supplies to the front.Hell, why stop at cars, considering the tendency to using radioactive materials for everyday objects of the era (such as clocks with glowing numbers), things like radioisotope decay powered canned food ration cookers for troops may not be too far fetched. On the plus side, you have now mutant soldiers, or soldiers nothing to lose.Did Germans had any answer to occasional mortar shell with a tactical warhead falling on top of their troops?

It was called project Orion and aimed at interplanetary space travel. It was initially planned as the vehicle would leave the earth like in the above picture (open nuclear explosions) because why not? There were also open cycle gas core reactor rocket designs. Their exhaust cones would glow brightly. What? Do you want the Hun to burn all our crops with his evil space mirror? So what if some isotopes fall over our fields, government says it’s totally safe.In the meantime transistors (1947) and H-Bomb (1951) would be developed. Transistors will allow mass production of guided rockets for example. But if you can use a tactical warhead to bring down a entire bomber formation, who cares guidance? (Ok, transistors are cheaper then enriched uranium, but I was making a point).

For the succeeding 6 years everything is hunky dory.Hitler is going about his business subjugating the Jews, expanding the Reich, etc. and his puppy dog, Hess, follows him about wagging his tail following every command Hitler gives.But then comes the war, whilst Hess is made 2nd in line to succeed Hitler following the invasion of Poland; Hitler also appoints Hess’s former chief of staff Martin Bormann as his personal secretary (a role formerly held by Hess). It is from this point onward Bormann starts taking more and more of Hess’s responsibilities.Slowly but surely Bormann replaces Hess as Hitler’s right hand man. Hess planned a consequential grand operation in order to thrust himself back into relevance and ultimately Hitler’s arms.In 1941, following many months of preparation, Hess sets off in his personal Messerschmitt Bf 110 on a flight to Scotland, His intentions?The only issue is Hitler has no idea, Hess is flying the plane alone, MI5 has intercepted letters Hess had sent to his contact in the UK, his contact in the UK hasn't responded to any of his letters and Hess had no authority to initiate peace talks.As you can imagine, it’s an absolute disaster.Hess’s plane is picked up by British radar and 3 Spitfires were dispatched to shoot down the unidentified German aircraft. Although the Spitfires couldn’t find Hess’s aircraft (as it was pitch black and he was flying extremely low) he is forced to parachute out as he was low on fuel.He landed in a field where the local farmer took him to the Home Guard, his arrival was passed up the chain of command and he did meet Churchill briefly amongst other senior cabinet members.But he was deemed mentally unstable and his proposals were not taken seriously, he was briefly held in the Tower of London but spent the duration of the war in a mansion under the guard of 150 soldiers where he remained until 1945, at which point he transferred to Germany, where he was charged for various crimes at the Nuremburg trials and given life imprisonment.When Hitler found out (via a letter Hess had sent just before his departure) he was furious. Hitler made out Hess had gone insane and stripped him of all his titles and duties.Hitler’s second in command, flies to the UK in the middle of a war without informing anyone and tries to single handedly end the war.Bloody mad manEdit:For the conspiracy theorists in the comments who think this didn’t happen, please direct your complaints at either the BBC for sanctioning, producers for creating or Netflix for relaying to a global audience, this documentary",0 followers,Brent Cooper,6.2K,7.9K,409.9M,2019,https://www.quora.com/If-World-War-II-continued-for-another-10-years-what-technological-innovations-would-have-emerged

The rapid increase in agricultural productivity is a MAJOR driver of the world today.We could track hundreds of similar stories and come to similar conclusions.But the big question is:WOULD THESE ADVANCES HAVE HAPPENED ANYWAY?Would these advances have come about WITHOUT the driving force of wartime?I think one good case to be made for that is with computers.We know that in around 1837, Charles Babbage had figured out all of the basics of how computers should work - funded by the British government who wanted more accurate artillery range tables (yep - war-stuff).However, Babbage was unable to get the work to a practical state - in part because of the lack of electronics - and in part because he was so slow at progressing the work that the needed artillery tables were eventually computed by hand. So the pressure to complete the work was never very great - funding was patchy - and there were no computers - his work was largely forgotten.But when the Germans started to encrypt their communications using the “Enigma Machine” during World War II, the need to decrypt them became essential and so Alan Turing (essentially) re-invented the idea.With much better funding and a much greater need - along with cheap relays and vacuum tubes coming out of other war production - computers were now sufficiently useful to take off - and TOTALLY change our entire culture and society.The lesson from this is that although the Victorian era could have made computers mechanically, or using relays - and by 1904, with the invention of vacuum tubes, they could have been fully functional devices - they never did go anywhere.Only with the pressure of encryption as a military tool in the 1930’s did the pressure (and funding) propel us into the computer age three decades later.OTHER EXAMPLES:The crazy amount of money that got put into the Manhatten project to develop the atom bomb had clear benefits leading to nuclear power.Airplanes were more or less just toys at the start of WWI - but by the end, we had metal-skinned monoplanes…and by the end of WWII, we had both jets and rockets…and the pressure of the cold war has propelled us into having spacecraft, satellites, rovers and people walking (and driving) around on the Moon.CONCLUSION:These kinds of “WHAT IF…” (or in this case “WHAT IF NOT…”) questions are clearly unanswerable in any definite manner.But the preponderance of evidence is that wars (although regrettable) do propel progress in technology.",26 followers,Balaji Viswanathan,2.3K,5.6K,427.2M,2020,https://www.quora.com/If-World-War-II-continued-for-another-10-years-what-technological-innovations-would-have-emerged

Surely the new modern Italian Army can conquer the much smaller nation of Greece.So the Italians muster along the Greek border in Albania and invade.The Italians haveThe Greeks are defending their border withObviously, the Italians have the numerical advantage- didn’t go well though.What followed is the massacre Mussolini predicted! Only it was Italians being massacred.Entire regiments are nearly wiped out with the Italians taking massive losses. Every single offensive fails miserably and leaves the Italian army stunned.The Greeks follow up these defensive victories with a counterattack. Unlike the Italians, the Greek offensives actually work and the Italians are pushed way back into Albania.The situation becomes dire and the Italians just flood men and guns to the front- desperately trying to stem the bleeding. 87,000 balloons to 250,000 in just a few months as the situation continues to deteriorate. The Italians are able to throw enough men at the situation to turn the war into a stalemate by April- though they have taken 100,000 losses and have now lost territory in this whole debacle.Keep in mind this is the Greek army. No disrespect to Greece (I love Greece) but Greece is a very small nation with about 1/10th the population and economy of Italy.Desperate, the Italians call on the Germans for aid. The Germans arrive, begin their own offensive, and Greece is completely conquered in 3 weeks.So why were the Italians such a disaster? Why did they fail against tiny Greece and why were their offensives in Africa so disastrous despite a massive numerical advantage?1: Italy was not prepared for this warEconomically Italy was an agrarian nation- similar to what Germany and France were in the late 1800s. Italy had factories to be sure but they were out of date and there were not many of them.Italy was not going to be able to put out large numbers of weapons, tanks, planes, and trucks just due to their lack of industry.Equipment-wise, the Italians were also severely lacking. They had developed some tanks but designed them to be quick and operate in the mountains. In the open (and the mountains) these lightly armored tanks were mere cannon fodder and the worst tanks of WW2.Since Italian industry was so far behind they couldn't innovate quickly enough to fix this. Even if they could they could never actually produce enough stuff to replace equipment in the field.2: Italian leadership was terribleThe Italian high command was chosen by party loyalty and experience. Their experience was WW1 though and these generals had their heads stuck in the 1910s still.Italian command failed to evolve to the changing landscape of war.Then you have Mussolini who was a bit of an idiot. He was over-ambitious and led Italy into disaster after disaster.3: Italian divisions were undersuppliedDivisions in WW2 needed lots of stuff. We may imagine WW2 as a tank war but it was really an infantry war. Tanks are expensive and a unit of infantry with an anti-tank gun could ravage a large tank platoon or battalion.Italian divisions lacked radios, artillery pieces, anti-tank guns, trucks, replacement equipment, armored support, recon support, and AA weaponry. Infantry alone was no match for properly supplied allied divisions.4: Italy lacked resourcesYou need lots of coal, oil, steel, copper, gold, and food to fight a world war. Italy had food but little else.Put simply even if the Italians had the factories and the technology they would still lack the necessary raw resources.",154 followers,Dominic Jesse,1.1K,0,0,2020,https://www.quora.com/If-World-War-II-continued-for-another-10-years-what-technological-innovations-would-have-emerged

Without the war we would not have developed the refinement of Uranium and Plutonium until the 60’s the development of a bomb would have been later.it was only the urgency of the war and threat that Germany was building a bomb that brought all the great minds together and provided the budget for the work.The biggest advancement was in nuclear chain reactions.

20,"We would still have made the advances, just not as quickly. The war focussed efforts, encouraged collaboration amongst competing interests and companies. It also required that governements had to spend huge amounts of money, way more than normal.

You get space flight, supersonic aircraft, passenger jets, hydrogen bombs, computers, genuine submarines. But like all science it is about building on what has gone before. That would still apply without the war, but the shortcuts that were applied would not happen, so things would take longer. Maybe nuclear bombs happen in the late 50s, along with jet fighters. We have to wait until the 70s for passenger jets",0 followers,John Garrison,591,148,4.5M,2021,https://www.quora.com/If-World-War-II-continued-for-another-10-years-what-technological-innovations-would-have-emerged
21,"Well, it’s difficult to answer, but one picture says more than a thousand words:It is the Tiergarten, the big park in central Berlin. Look it up on Google Maps.

Everything, literally everything in Germany was destroyed, the whole country was a rubble. Of course you can argue that they had it coming. But still the pictures from those days are shocking.As a side note, I once talked to a very old woman from Berlin. She said, “When I was young I believed the Kaiser. He took us to war and my husband never came back. I was left a single mother. Then came Hitler and I believed him. He also took us to war and my son never came back. Then I was just an old mother without a child. The communists came and said that this time, everything would be better. I believed them. They took away the beautiful house my late husband built for me and gave it to someone else. So don’t be as stupid as I was, never trust any politician.”","2,060 followers",Lucas Mund,1.3K,294,1.9M,2017,https://www.quora.com/If-World-War-II-continued-for-another-10-years-what-technological-innovations-would-have-emerged

And there was no point ordering armies to fight if they could not be adequately supplied and therefore moved, as the 1944 Ardennes Offensive demonstrated.So as modern warfare demands movement, and movement demands mechanisation and mechanisation demands fuel my vote would go to something that enabled armies to both move vast quantities of fuel around the theatre of war and made it easy to utilise on the battlefield.","66,693 followers",Dima Vorobiev,1.7K,4.2K,139M,2018,https://www.quora.com/If-World-War-II-continued-for-another-10-years-what-technological-innovations-would-have-emerged
