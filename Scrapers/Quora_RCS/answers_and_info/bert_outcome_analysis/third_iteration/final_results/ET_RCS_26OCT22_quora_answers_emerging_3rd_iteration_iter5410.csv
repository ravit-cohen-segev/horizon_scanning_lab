The skill set must be there a priori, else you perceive the wrong opportunity.One must start from the opposite end of the equation, namely the ability to spot opportunityA simple case in point. I missed the entire smart phone thingy because I got out of the corporate world before the internet fully manifested in 2003–5. I had my own gig, was my own boss, and had one of the first twenty inch monitors on my desk. I had no outside impediments to using technology however I chose to use it.Compare and contrast that with a corporate professional, that“Surfing the net is not productive work”“We will monitor all your online activities and emails”“We will block all access to social media within the corporate network”“You cannot communicate with counterparts external to the organization without first going through management”“You cannot communicate with inter company colleagues abroad, you must go through established internal channels, including all established geographic areas of responsability”In other words, the smart phone was a way to break out of corporate shackles.Even if the equipment was on your own dime. The smartphone was your connection to the outside world. Monitoring personal calls is hard, monitoring personal emails is easier. Banning social media is expedient.Absent any of the above restraints,One is only as good as one’s network. Call it a knowledge network. Call it your knowledge domain. Call it your brain trust.I do not see business opportunity, what I see is human potential.How can that human potential be put to use? What problems can that brain trust solve?The solvable problems are bound by the capability of the brain trust. A true entrepreneur looks at business problems in terms of the talent available to him or her.If you cannot visualize the team first, you are blind to the real opportunities.This applies to purely human activities, like it applies to traditional industrial production.If production is what you want to do you must call on all your specialist subcontractors, and find out what their capabilities are. You can do the same internally. You can get on a plane and widen your search. Its only once you know what your in network possibilities are, that you can realize the potential of the network.Its an chicken and egg problem.In the pre-smartphone age, manufacturing was a requirement of product definition; now you can piggy back on somebody else’s hardware - software offering. Originally, Apple had to build the iPhone before it could launch its App store and its music offering. The iPhone is the chicken.Now you can tap their hardware offering. Now you can access their network effect. You are limited in scope to what somebody else will allow you to get away with, but you are not constrained by the need to build your own expensive ecosystem.On the other hand if the actionable data captured from the user experience is the product, somebody else is capturing the revenue from your contribution. Ease of content distribution is extermediated from the revenue opportunity.If you are under thirty you do not see that the opportunity is limited by the network externalities because that is the only consensus model in your experience.Necessarily though, your offering is by definition limited to what your brain trust sees and has ability to execute on. Beware ofSome people are good at spotting opportunity, and some are spectacularly bad at it.I think this depends on the ability to see the larger picture through the prism of one’s knowledge network. Limited network equates to limited visibility.Limited skill, limited execution.One does not execute on a business solution. The execution is entirely dependent on the skill one can bring to bear on the problem. Absent that network effect, the itch can be real, the solution realistic, but absent the externalities, there is no way “Problems you cannot solve at your scale are problems you best not bother with.The demarcation between realizable and delusional breaks down to your ability to visualize the problem in terms of the human assetsIf those assets are not already available to you, chances are that you are not actually visualizingOne thing almost all tech entrepreneurs fail to understand is that product does not sell itself.The problem is that the solution presupposes a problem. If you do not have a customer for the product its because its a problem you created in your imagination. The solution is consequently divorced from reality.Absent in network customer defined problems,The tricky part is asking customers for what they want.Wordperfect circa 1995 was not a word processor. It was a way to fire secretaries and the data entry pool. Never had a secretary myself, but my father had two. There was some skill required there, which Microsoft Word fully dispensed with.Which means the purpose of entrepreneurship is to find a way to exterminate the person you are trying to sell something to, provided the company they work for has product that commands revenue in excess of their costs.If you do not see your execution in terms of getting your customers fired, you will never realize theI had that explained to me by a sales guy I nicknamed “Iron Balls” who worked for a tier 1 semiconductor manufacturer. “I don’t want your business. What I want is to capture your value add, take you out of the picture, and go after your customers. Once I can figure out how to do that, your gone. And I will, because in the mean time you do not have many options, and since you are a no money nobody, you will gladly take the trade financing I can offer you…”It took them ten years, and that’s the only reason they respected me.Luckily I learnt that early in the process, because I listen and I understand that I am only as good as my ability to listen in network.Science innovates at the intersection of unrelated disciplines.Three copies of the same exact book, will not three times the knowledge impart.If somebody is there to do what you already know how to do, the information exchange is limited in scope.It buys time not knowledge. Knowledge like partnerships must be multidisciplinary.Tech people see marketing as “pretty picture stuff”:Actually first time around, I stoped her once she did the business card, I had seen enough. Out of love, I kept using them. Out of greed, I paid a professional to do the pretty picture stuff…If you plan to bring any product to market and do not have a marketing specialist on board on day one, you will fail. End of discussion.I don’t care if you like him or her or not. I don't care what they look like, smell like or dress like. Don't care if they can code or not. Don't care about anything.Do they have the ability to market?At the end of the day the only thing of value on the balance sheet is the trade mark equity you have invested in.Sales costs can run from 20–50% of your revenue. The only thing that can bring that down is your trademark equity. If customers are calling you for a solution to their problems, with budget allocated and contact person promoted to the potential solution, you have trade mark equity.Hustle is no substitute for brand equity. Hustle is often how you get there, and people lacking in hustle are a big problem.I do not know the first thing about marketing. Okay I am lying, I know less than nothing, for if I knew what I did not know, I would at least know one thing. But I don’t know what I don’t knowBut I know better, which means I know that I need a marketing person that has been around long enough to have seen the law of diminishing returns as it applies to say banner ads and ad words auctions.If the in network person wants to wrap a two dollar bill around every dollar shipped, shop it some more. You are better off throwing flat noodles at the wall in the expectation that the round stuff has less contact area.In other words, you need a co-conspirator respectful of what they do not know. Which means they know something…I have often felt the need to explain the Roman Trinity to protestants…Its made up of three separate things:If you are preaching Christ’s love and forgiveness, that is all you are allowed to do.If you are laying down God’s law, the law of Jews, that is all you can do.If you are working on the manifestation, the female creative part, the Virgin Mary, that is all you should be doing.In other words you cannot be preaching about laying down the law, if its love you want to build. Similarly you cannot be preaching love when you are shaking down the congregation. The law says nothing about your ability to fleece the flock.If you are marrying for money, don’t tell me its love -its a contract.Those are all mutually excludable paradigms, which is why theocracies do not work. Theocracies fail because you cannot point a gun to somebody’s head and tell them you love them. There is a difference between rape, paying for it, and marrying the person you love. If you cannot tell the difference, you have no business being in the creative business.And then you have the complication of sixty different religiousYou must alternate in perpetual divinity: First the Spirit. Then the Law. Then the manifestation. They must succeed themselves.Today you need the love, tomorrow the rules, and the day after the manifestation.Some people want to combine the three. That’s not possible.The important point here is that you need in network all three skills, because those are specialist skills.Today we create.Tomorrow we encapsulate and define the product.The day after we sell.Religious ordersIts no different that parenting. You send the parasites out in the world with enough rope to hang themselves. They promptly hang themselves. Do you give them a hug? Do you beat them for finger painting outside the lines? Or, do you throw cash at the problem?Give em a hug, and send them out to make more mistakes. Mistakes you can afford to throw money at or mistakes that reside at a safe distance from lucifers with nothing better to do than throw shackles on them.On the good ship of commerce there is only one captain. Captain decides if you get love, a beating or a budget. Good captains know when its time to change course. Today we love, tomorrow we encapsulate the solution, the day after we are in port selling the loot we plundered.Morality ends where the law begins for the law should only apply to criminal behavior. Ethics is the domain in between the two.As I said the object is not to get somebody’s business, but rather to find a way to put them out of business. Do it ethically.If you are arguing from legal documents, its no longer a partnership. People who pull out the By Laws every two minutes make for bad business partners. Likewise customer engagements where the legalese drives the process are already doomed. The law is the exit strategy from civil discourse.The ability to keep things separate in your mind is nine tenths of the solution.Similarly you must transition from problem definition centric, to product specification centric, to customer centric. “Why didn’t you tell me that was the spec six months ago… now I got to re-do everything…”Flexibility to shift focus when the manifestation requires it, is what you are looking for. Different perspectives shed light differently.Anybody who insists they are right, should be avoided, for they do not transition through the trinity well.Some problems should linger in the imagination until such time as somebody in your brain trust comes up with the technology to execute on them.In the mean time, be cognizant of timing.Some people see the light.Some people make their own light.Some people are laser focused.Some people are good at lighting a fire under people’s asses.Some people bury the light in darkness.Find the light… otherwise the exercise is moot.Some people invest on the basis of the numbers, some other on the basis of the quality of the light.Bad numbers dim the light, good numbers brighten it.Rivets and fasteners don’t require much light. Content and finance attract it like no other. Absent gold lust, its power you want. That of course engenders its own light. As explored in great length above, lust, power and gold should be kept separate.Between a know it all with no light and a no nothing with light, the entrepreneur should always chose the light. Just an opinion of course…And that’s my story and I am sticking to it.Thanks for the ask.","224,565 followers",Gayle Laakmann McDowell,1.1K,1.2K,49.8M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Ive-just-recently-launched-a-technology-startup-business-Im-now-looking-for-a-partner-co-founder-How-does-one-go-about-finding-one-most-suitable-for-emerging-technologies-like-mine

Sulphur was easily sourced and turned into a pure form on Islands such as Iceland and charcoal could be made almost anywhere.Natural sources of saltpetre were found but a way to produce it by means of ‘modern’ chemistry was also discovered. Urea from urine was broken down by bacteria to form ammonia which was then turned into nitrite and nitrates. The group of nitrates thus produced could be used for gunpowder but was quickly spoilt by moisture due to the presence of unwanted nitrates. Distilling it with potash produced a generally pure form of potassium nitrate that kept well.Further refinement consisted of introducing wet grinding which made for a better mixture and granulating the gunpowder so as to produce corned gunpowder which was more explosive than the older variants. This was especially important for handheld firearms which fired relatively light projectiles and needed all the velocity they could get.On the mechanical side of the equation we also see advances; the barrel had lengthened and the stock was changed to produce a modern shouldered firearm. A pivoting serpentine shaped lever was used to hold a match that could ignite powder sitting in the pan which would in turn ignite the main charge.Late 14th/early 15th century handgonne with the old gunpowder and ignition by handMiddle to late 15th century gun with serpentine lever, longer barrel and likely the newer corned gunpowderA late 15th century addition to this design was adding spring operated lever and trigger which produced the matchlock.For the rank and file soldiers various other locks would be introduced in the 16th century but the ‘true’ flintlock invented in 1610 eventually became the standard.From there one there were many small incremental changes but the essence remained the same. A British soldier fighting at the Second Battle of Chuenpi in 1841 would have largely done what an Austrian soldier would have done in 1490. A main charge, wadding and bullet were loaded through the muzzle and stamped down with a ramrod. The pan was filled with some loose powder and then either the smouldering end of a match or the sparks produced by a flint striking steel would ignite it and send a bullet flying toward whatever direction the barrel was pointing.More than three centuries in which the fundamentals of handheld firearms stayed the same.Some less common features mostly found on specialised weapons such as hunting weapons were breechloaders, wheellocks and rifling.The wheellock invented sometimes around 1500 was a spring operated wheel that spun against like a piece of pyrite held in a clamp and functioned much like lighters of today. A further refinement consisted of introducing one that was self spanning which meant that one did not have to span it with a spanner after every shot.Breechloading using movable (spring operated) breechblocks and metal cartridges existed in the 15th century but on the whole breechloading rather than muzzle loading did not become mainstream until the 19th century.The same more or less goes for rifling which was pioneered in the late 15th or early 16th century. Specialists used it but due to fouling and slow loading the accuracy gain was not worth it for common soldiers.What happened to the smoothbore muzzle loading blackpowder guns in the 19th century consists of several innovations; percussion caps, minie bullets, new breechloaders and nitrocellulose.Edward Charles Howard‘I first attempted to make the mercurial powder fulminate [explode] by concussion; and for that purpose laid about a grain of it upon a cold anvil, and struck it with a hammer, likewise cold: it detonated slightly, not being, as I suppose, struck with a flat blow; for, upon using 3 or 4 grains, a very stunning disagreeable noise was produced, and the faces both of the hammer and the anvil were much indented.’ - HowardAt any rate someone got the bright idea of putting the stuff in copper caps around the 1820s which produced a percussion cap that worked in wet weather and had a misfire rate of only 4 per 1000. Furthermore they didn’t require gunpowder to be put in a pan as the spark provided by the percussion cap was enough to ignite the main charge. British guard regiments started to be equipped with the percussion cap system in 1836 and started giving them to the rank and file in the 1840s.Alfred Nobel would also use these mercury fulminate caps to detonate his dynamite.The hammer would strike the percussion cap placed on the nipple resulting in it igniting the main charge.Around 1848 the French captain Minie came up with another key invention called theThe bullet could be quickly removed from theIn a static setup a smoothbore musket hit a target out at 100 yards roughly 75% of the time while a rifled musket with minie ball hit it 95% of the time. At 400 yards a smoothbore only hit it around 4% of the time while a minie ball still had an accuracy of 52%What this meant was that from now on the rank and file could utilise rifled muzzle loading muskets without loss of rate of fire. It is with these rifled muskets and external percussion caps that the Americans slaughtered each other in the American Civil war.However work also started on guns with different rifling systems and ones that could be breach loaded speeding up the process which had hampered muzzle loading rifles prior to the minie ball.In the 1830sThe external ignition system is removed and instead a paper cartridge containing a bullet, percussion cap and gunpowder charge is loaded into the gun via a breech. On pulling the trigger a spring powered firing pin will move forward with enough speed to cause the percussion cap to ignite the main charge.This newThe 1857 model needle gun clearly showing the open breech and needleThe American’s also came up with theThe worlds western military's effectively switched from muzzle loading smoothbore flintlocks to rifled percussion cap muskets in the course of a little over two decades with some even beginning to use cartridges with blast caps and firing pins.Who came up with the first metal cartridges is still being debated but they were perfected in the mid 19th century, theIn 1866, just thirty years after the first British soldiers got their hands on percussion caps, the French introduced theSubsequent innovation consisted of adding tubular magazines which happened on European service rifles in the 1880s and following that the introduction of box magazines on rifles such as the 1888The next step was the invention of smokeless powder which was first used in military rifles with theI am not a gun nut who has the knowledge to state this unequivocally but it does seem like firearms only experienced two very brief periods of innovation followed by only marginal upgrades.From a tube on a stick in the early 15th century to shouldered matchlock in less than a century and breechloading wheellocks in slightly more than a century. The flintlock has its advantages but to a degree does not represent a quantum leap forward. We see the resulting gun being used until the 1830s when the muzzle loading smoothbore flintlock turned into semi-automatic and automatic rifles in less than a century.If we disregard the flintlock the change from tube on stick to modern handheld firearms really took place between 1410–1500 and 1840–1920, a period of fundamental innovation of little more than 170 years. Hell if history is any guide we might still be stuck with our current technology for a while.The question of course is whether any of this could have been invented earlier.With regards to gunpowder I would definitely say so. Though rare in Europe saltpetre is found in nature in other places and neither charcoal or sulphur are rare.As discussed in this answer the mixture was discovered quite early but it took long before it turned into a true propellant;The mixture dates from the 9th century which might mean it was potentially around the lifetime of Charlemagne. It was weaponized in 11th or 12th century but only became an explosive propellant around 1240 AD.If you know what you want (a gun that fires a projectile) and have the required ingredients I don’t see why it wouldn’t have been possible to make the stuff when years were still counted down instead of up. Bronze casting definitely seems to have been of a high enough level to produce gun barrels. If you figure out the wet grinding and corning process then lever based guns are also quite possible.Matchlocks would be slightly harder requiring at least basic knowledge of spring operated locks and the proper springs and metal quality, though Japan seems to have done just fine with brass springs. Wheellocks would have been considerably harder and I doubt you could get those prior to the 15th century. Even in the 17th century many nations did not produce them or failed to produce them in militarily significant numbers. An example would be Sweden who experienced major shortages for their cuirassiers.But what about the second major set of innovations?From just looking at it the minie ball seems like a reasonably easy thing to produce. Instead of using round moulds one might simply use the minie pattern mould. However I am not entirely sure what kind of rifling was used with it and how much it differed from earlier 16th, 17th and 18th century rifling. If the difference is minor it might well have been possible to produce guns capable of firing minie bullets in the 16th century,The second major innovation, and one that seems to have kicked off the whole 19th century gun revolution would be the percussion cap. The one patented in the early 19th century after it was invented by or patented by Forsyth.Actually they didn’t quite invent it.Alchemists of the early and mid 17th century such asThe required ingredients for mercury fulminate are mercury, ethanol and nitric acid, or as a 15th century German alchemist might have called them; aqua vitae, aqua fortis and hydrargyrum.Mercury would not present much of a problem and following the introduction of distillation to Europe in the 12th century and invention of fractional distillation in the 13th century would allow them to get some pretty high proof alcohol. Nitric acid would be slightly rarer but it had been around since the 13th/14th century when it was discovered you could get it from green vitriol or saltpetre.Essentially I believe it would have been possible to make mercury fulminate in the 14th or 15th century and since copper sheeting was also around it would have been possible to make percussion caps right around the time people got around to make shouldered firearms. If the quality of starting materials was sufficiently good and the price not too high I think we might have seen some percussion cap muskets.Seeing how Southern Germany also imported quite a bit of cotton for their cotton/linnen cloths it may have been possible for an alchemist to create some primitiveDisregarding early smokeless powders and focusing on percussion caps and gunpowder it might be possible to make a modern day cartridge. Paper mills had been up and running since 1290 so that would be not issue but even brass sheet could have been used to produce metallic black powder cartridges. Whether such integrated cartridges could be used depends partially on whether people figured out they could put a spring powered firing pin or needle in the ensemble.All in all I think that with the knowhow some pretty advanced guns could have been made in 15th or 16th century Europe. Industrial grade metals and machine tool precision notwithstanding making rifled guns for common use and potentially modern cartridges could may have been possible.","14,896 followers",Krister Sundelin,4.5K,23.8K,89.8M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Ive-just-recently-launched-a-technology-startup-business-Im-now-looking-for-a-partner-co-founder-How-does-one-go-about-finding-one-most-suitable-for-emerging-technologies-like-mine

So the consequences of missing possible ones are incalculable.But good candidate for history’s biggest missed opportunity is that there was no take-up of Paracelsus’ observation of the general anaesthetic properties of ether (‘sweet vitriol’) as long ago as the early 16th century. A gap of three and a half centuries before general anaesthetics were introduced in practice. Three and a half centuries of sufferings that might have been avoided.

So the consequences of missing possible ones are incalculable.But good candidate for history’s biggest missed opportunity is that there was no take-up of Paracelsus’ observation of the general anaesthetic properties of ether (‘sweet vitriol’) as long ago as the early 16th century. A gap of three and a half centuries before general anaesthetics were introduced in practice. Three and a half centuries of sufferings that might have been avoided. Much surgery is quite impractical without a anaesthetics, and when it was practical it was a horror. If instead the use of ether had been taken up, much of the medicine and science would have been possible, much would have become necessary and so the Science and medicine would have received a strong fillip and been stimulated to get started decades or centuries earlier. (As well as anaesthesia, antisepsis is also essential for surgery, but Paracelsus was also not just ahead of but contrary to his times in his recognition of that too in practice, though he could not have had a theory for what was involved).Another delayed-impact discovery was that of chromatography by Mikhail Tsvett. This is a technique for separation of different chemical substances according to their different adsorption on solids - you can notice it in the spread and separation of colours of inks and dyes on blotting paper. It is much easier than other methods being used when Tsvett invented it at the beginning of the 20th century. After which it was largely ignored or forgotten for nearly half a century. But together with the related technique of electrophoresis it is involved directly or indirectly in nearly every research in modern biology. Which might have been a decade or two ahead of what it is if Tsvett’s work had been exploited immediately.","358,947 followers",Sean Kernan,3.1K,5.6K,726.9M,2017,https://www.quora.com/Ive-just-recently-launched-a-technology-startup-business-Im-now-looking-for-a-partner-co-founder-How-does-one-go-about-finding-one-most-suitable-for-emerging-technologies-like-mine

If you combine that with fine copper wire, you have a current. Not too useful; it might creat enough heat to light a fire, maybe. But then have a compass near the wire and observe the deflection. From there it isn't too far to creation of a solenoid for a telegraph and then electric motors.The key is the scientific method and the scientific community.

Back then, knowledge was jealously guarded so nobody could build upon the work of others. But if many researchers were messing around with batteries, eventually one of them would have a compass or magnet nearby and notice the interaction. The scientific method would then come into play to determine the principles behind the phenomena.",UNKNOWN,Prajwal,5.3K,582,3.9M,2017,https://www.quora.com/Ive-just-recently-launched-a-technology-startup-business-Im-now-looking-for-a-partner-co-founder-How-does-one-go-about-finding-one-most-suitable-for-emerging-technologies-like-mine

AI, trends of the year may be such as smarter products, smarter vehicles, smarter processes, smarter consumer goods, smarter tech solutions, and even smarter cities & smart companion.5. IoT(Health Sensors). That is especially evident in the healthcare industry. While there are certainly factors to consider when it comes to HIPAA compliance and personal data, the value of sensors to help people improve their health and well-being is undisputed.
