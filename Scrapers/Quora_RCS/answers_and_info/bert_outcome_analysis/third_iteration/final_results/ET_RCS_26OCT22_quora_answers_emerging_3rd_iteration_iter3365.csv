If their star system is one hundred light years away, that would mean it would take them two hundred years to get here. And if a galaxy were a city, one hundred light years would be like going next door. Odds are that they are further away than that.As mentioned above, we know nothing of alien psychology. What would they think of us? Would they see us as possible friends, or as enemies, or as pawns in some interstellar politics of which we know nothing? Or would their reaction be even more bizarre than that?Nobody knows.

Germany is not the most technologically advanced country. It could be pretty close, but there are major elements of society who dedicate themselves to making sure that Germany uses inferior technology that kills more people, damages the environment more, costs more money, and will cause the total collapse of Earth’s biosphere due to a runaway greenhouse effect. Mostly in the Green Party.

The Coopers who failed ended up making “dry barrels” that only held produce or things that wouldn’t spoil. There are very few people who know how to make a barrel today. Even Jack Daniels, the biggest barrel maker in the world, uses an automated process now because making them by hand is too slow. The art of coopering is dying. There are very, very few people who know how to make a barrel left in the world and fewer every year, yet barrel making was an advanced technology that changed the entire world for literally thousands of years.Incidentally. the most prolific barrel in the world today is the ASB or American Standard Barrel that hold 53 gallons because America makes more barrels than anyone else in the world. Many used Jack Daniels barrels are re-used to make other kinds of liquor in other parts of the world.Do you know who the highest paid man in the community was in “ancient times”? It was the Wheelwright.Making a wheel from wood with an axle that attaches to a cart and doesn’t fall apart within a mile or two is one of the most “advanced technologies” of all time. Without it, most civilizations would have failed or failed to spread. Cart wheels are complex and the forces must play against each other continuously to hold the wheel together as it rolls. A Cartwright made as much then as a jet airline pilot back does today. In the 1880s when the average wage was $1.50 a day, the Wheelwright was making 90 dollars a week. On the Mayflower they brought one single cart over to America and it was the most valuable thing on the ship manifest, worth more than 10 times the next most valuable thing on the ship. Can you make a cartwheel?

There might be some that we are not quite sure how the effect was achieved, but they are not particularly advanced, and it's just a lack of knowledge.

Simply put, you need a 'hook', which means something so special that it is pretty rare.  (A hook is also known in the admissions business as an 'institutional need', something that the schools want but will never tell the public about.  Div 1 athletes, children of major donors or celebrities, best in state, best in nation, academic superstars, someone who is published in a major publication, etc are examples nationally.  MIT has its own institutional needs that their outstanding admissions office works hard to identify and admit.)  Note that this is not just high scores and perfect grades, as most people believe.  It's different.As Anonymous says, for MIT  be world-class at something (accent on 'world class'), crush school (that's right - crush it, no excuses) and build writing and interpersonal skills so you can communicate effectively with others.MIT people are action people so the admissions office is looking for people who regularly make things happen for themselves and others with great self-initiative.  A deeper than normal curiosity is critical because that screams MIT.  And a fearlessness is necessary because not only is MIT the most extraordinary university of its kind on Earth, it's also one of the most demanding.  (There's no place to hide in the curriculum there as one can in Ivy schools.)  Each of these attributes must be represented by actual evidence in the case.  But it's the hook that gets one admitted.If I could tell future applicants anything, it is to understand the culture of the individual school and see if you are a match.  For example, MIT is an action place and so is well suited for action-types and not really that suited for intellectual types.  Also, do not pick a college based on ranking.  That's just ignorance.  All ranking systems have been designed to sell products so they are neither neutral authorities nor really true. You must learn about schools yourself in this era of Big Spin.  That takes work.And most importantly, don't take advice about college admissions from anyone who has never admitted for a living.  Your friends and parents know nothing about such an arcane process and do what we all do - make assumptions about how it appears to work and then act on the assumptions they just made up as if they were true (a process I refer to as M.S.U. - making sh*t up).
