From day one, the leadership knew this was going to be a big cake for whoever wins the bid, as the scale of the potential High Speed Railway (HSR) coverage is unheard of in this industry.The rule of engagement is set out very clearly from the beginning: any firm wished to bid in this mammoth project must transfer their technology to Chinese domestic partners.Although it may sound like shooting oneself in foot by transferring cutting edge technology to a developing country with huge industrial capacity, the accountants soon worked out that even if a firm transfer all of its technology, the profit from the project will still more than offset the cost of R&D for the next generation of HSRs (this idea was heralded by Bombardier who started transferring technologies since as early as 1998).The Big Bucks:In 2010 alone, the Ministry of Railway (MOR) invested over US$100 billion in new construction. The next year, in 2011, another US$100 billion is invested. If compared with military expenditure, this places MOR as No.3 in the world, behind USA and China and ahead of Russia (US$87 billion in 2013).With this much cash on the table, the project has become a modern day gold rush for the likes of Siemens, Alstom, Bombardier and Kawasaki.Hatred of Japan:Initially, Shinkansen train sets (Kawasaki) was going to be awarded to supply the entire project. Once made public, the decision was overturned by angry nationalists who gathered over a million signatories against the deal based on Japan's unresolved WWII atrocities.As a result, the bidding process re-opened to start favoring European and North American companies. The structure of bidding also changed - it has decided that instead of a winner-takes-all scenario, all participants are going to have a slice of the cake which lowered the risk as well as maximized technology transfer benefit to domestic train makers.To the Chinese train makers, instead of obtaining one type of technology from Japanese train maker, they now have access to all types of HSR technologies thanks to the re-structure.Game Theory:The foreign bidders were played off against one another in a text book Prisoner's Dilemma: holding out on technology transfer or refusing to lower prices will yield maximum profit but risks missing out entirely on the bidding. If all Chinese requirements are met, however, the profit margin will hurt greatly as well as facing risk of losing one's market leader position by nurturing Chinese competitors from end to end.The high octane game ended surprisingly well to the Chinese - the final contracts are not only similar in structure with the aim to offer maximum assistance to domestic partners in digesting and maturing foreign technologies (e.g. from the 60 train set orders Kawasai won, three would be built in Japan, six kit sets would be assembled in China and the remaining 51 would be made and assembled in China), but also set a new low cost benchmark for the HSR industry.Siemens was the only one who decided to stood its ground - but not for long. Due to its high asking price, it was the only train maker not awarded any contract in 2004. The following year, Siemens reshuffled the bidding team and lowered its price to win a 60 train set order in the 350km/h category.As a group, the major train companies 'lost out' on maintaining their competitive advantage by failing to squeeze out maximum profits to maintain their lead for the next-gen HSR to fend off the inevitable assault from the very competitors they helped raised.Conclusion:China has significantly reduced its partnership with western train makers in the on-going HSR expansions. The reliability and speed of domestic trains have steadily improved to a satisfactory level, often exceeding the specs of the original train sets designed by western train makers. Although China's overseas HSR bids have yielded mixed results so far, it has leaped over hurdles that would otherwise take decades to overcome.One can say that China bought its way to become a serious contender in the HSR industry. Even with a deep pocket, this is still easily said than done without an uncompromising goal and a highly efficient governing structure.",3 followers,Henry Lu,1.5K,111,2.1M,2015,https://www.quora.com/How-did-China-become-a-strong-competitor-in-the-high-speed-rail-industry

While this may not be a direct analogy, but it gives us the sense of the capability of ‘reverse engineering’ in the DNA of Chinese population.Come 2015, today China is the High-speed railway (HSR) leader around the globe, both in technology and operation. China has the world's longest HSR network with over 19,369.8 km (12,035.8 mi) of track in service as of December 2014, which is more than the rest of the world's HSR tracks combined. This is not due to an overnight planning but a result of meticulous and shrewd planning over the years. Meteoritic rise of Chinese HSR industry was due to the culmination of many social, demographic, economic, industrial and technical reasons. I will try to list out some of them which majorly influenced HSR industry in China. Also, the reasons are ordered in such a way that it will help in understanding China’s journey from HSR development to a dominant player.","13,150 followers",Godfree Roberts,1.5K,615,12.2M,2015,https://www.quora.com/How-did-China-become-a-strong-competitor-in-the-high-speed-rail-industry

3,"When China was first establishing their high-speed railway industry, they contracted with the major players that were building high-speed rail: Alstom (France), Siemens (Germany) and several Japanese manufacturers including Hitachi.  Rather than simply paying these firms to build rail, the Chinese required them to partner with a Chinese manufacturer and turn over all the intellectual property and knowledge necessary for the Chinese manufacturer to be able to build high-speed trains independently of the overseas supplier by the end of the contract.

While the industry is still in its infancy, experts claim that it is gradually consolidating. The edtech industry is one of those unusual instances in which consolidation has begun, and that too early in space's growth.Today, the education technology industry is primarily divided into two segments: test prep and skill creation. Byju's $300 million acquisition of Mumbai-based edtech startup WhiteHat Jr last year fell into the latter group. However, test preparation is a larger sector. Thus, Byju's and Aakash Educational Services sought to grow into new markets, while the former desired a share of the test preparation market.The edtech room has always been technologically based. With the pandemic and the uncertainty that comes with it, the process of digitalisation among traditional players in the test prep space could accelerate.
