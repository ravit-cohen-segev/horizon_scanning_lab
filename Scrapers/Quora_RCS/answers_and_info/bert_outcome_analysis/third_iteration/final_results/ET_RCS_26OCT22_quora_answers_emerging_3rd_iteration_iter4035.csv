A Japanese company recently landed two bots on a asteroid and it plans on sending hundreds more to collect data about the composition of these bodies. A professor at the University of Hawaii, Robert Jedicke says the earth has many “mini” moons or asteroids and space is a tough place to haul heavy items, so mining asteroids for water and whatever else may be there of value and rarity could be very lucrative. Dr. Jedicke believes that this will be a huge area of economic growth in the next hundred years. Because of private investors like Paul Allen and Elon Musk and others it is likely that the government involvement, outside of defensive reasons, would likely be more in the form of tax credits and exemptions for companies that persue the risk of space exploration and development. We can only imagine the advances in technology that may be in store for humanity due to these developments.Here are the first pictures of the asteroids surface just taken this week!Hayabusa 2 rovers send new images from Ryugu surface","30,216 followers",Antariksh Bothale,11.1K,342,6.6M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Federal-spending-on-NASA-peaked-at-4-41-of-GDP-in-1966-and-now-its-around-a-tenth-of-that-Given-that-space-exploration-has-been-a-huge-driver-of-technological-development-would-it-make-sense-to-increase-funding-if

I don’t think modern people would be able to explain everything at the rate they wanted to know more!There is a difference in philosophies between the culture above and the one identified, that I don’t think would be interested in these subjects. One is interested in the physical World and the underlying rules that govern these things and the other not. Peak Rome is the very beginning of the Roman empire, they don’t show an interest in moving these subjects forward, perhaps civil engineering which they were very good at. An interest in, physics, maths and technology were not things Rome considered of any import, so these subjects would likely fall on deaf eyes. Never say never, but the different subjects would appeal and be better received by entirely different civilisations, astronomy would appeal to Egyptians and Sumerians that would also appreciate Mathematics.

They were military roads aimed at moving rapidly large infantry units from place to place. Starting by the Late Antiquity, though, the cavalry started becoming more preeminent in Europe. Roman roads are not friendly to horses, whose feet get damaged by the too hard surface (especially if the horse is not shod). A horse unit can move faster than a unit of foot soldiers by simply riding in the countryside. Even if the horse unit would ride along the side the road (as carts did in the previous centuries), the foot soldiers would have no hope to keep up with them. Not needing roads also made the riders more flexible, able to travel in directions that were harder to travel for the Roman infantry. This made the Roman roads, as beautifully built as they were, not just too costly but also totally outdated.The domes of Hagia SofiaThe same principles can be applied to most of the Roman technology. Another example is the dome. Sure, the Pantheon is remarkable: what makes it remarkable is that the Romans were able to build such a big and stable dome with such an antiquate and unwieldy technology. This technology was not at all forgotten, it was still used by the Byzantines to build their churches, such as Hagia Sofia, which built upon this technology and made it more modern, better planned, and even more stable. But the Arabs brought to Europe a new and far better way to build domes, which were easier to build and required less material. Finally, the medieval ribbed domes and vaults became standard because of their lightness (they required a fraction of the material used in the Pantheon).The crossed arch dome of the Cordoba Great MosqueMuch of the technology used by Romans in the classical age had already started to become badly outdated by the Late Antiquity, and it got slowly superseded by innovative technology brought on by the Middle Ages.",13 followers,Robert Hynes,7.3K,715,2.4M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Federal-spending-on-NASA-peaked-at-4-41-of-GDP-in-1966-and-now-its-around-a-tenth-of-that-Given-that-space-exploration-has-been-a-huge-driver-of-technological-development-would-it-make-sense-to-increase-funding-if

Say you got really lucky, a monk found you first. And you got super lucky that you studied Latin in high school for 3 years and you can actually communicate with this monk who also knows Latin.And you explained your situation, and the monk, who’s actually a Bishop, was super open-minded and didn’t throw you in a nuthouse and believed everything you said, and you were from the future, and there are planes and cars and internet in the future.So what knowledge could you give to the good Bishop and hopefully beneficial to mankind?You can’t help them with cars or computers since they all require significant knowledge in engineering, not to mention most of the components haven’t been invented.I guess you could write down Newton's laws of motion. Although I suspect it’d be too abstract to make any difference.You could explain the world is round, and the Bishop would tell you that most educated people know the world is round. We knew the world is round since antiquity.You could tell the Bishop that there’s another continent across the ocean, and the Bishop will tell you, yeah, he heard about Vineland from the Danes. Even if you identified other continents and faraway lands (like China or India), and the Bishop is willing to fund an expedition, would you be able to guide the expedition from England to India, without modern GPS or a paper map?Sure, you could provide a map and let others do the exploring. Could you draw a (somewhat) accurate map that could help guide the expedition through the Euroasian continent?You could try to boil some willow bark and use that to ease pain and reduce fevers. However, you probably won’t have the expertise or equipment to extract salicin from the willow barks.You could teach them how to make beer. Beer was popular in the European continent as early as the 12th century I think, but it won’t reach England until the 15th century. Then again, unless you’re a hipster with a microbrewery in your backyard, I doubt you’ll have the technical know-how to make beer from scratch.I guess you could try to warn people about the Norman Conquest in a few decades.

They told me that they were very hungry and wanted something to eat. So I saw in my plate and there were exactly three pieces of apple there and gave one to each of them. I asked them to wait so that I can get something more for them to eat and I rushed inside to get some more food for them. But by the time I returned they had gone. After this whole experience I felt so full and contented with no trace of hunger and felt extreme bliss and ecstasy for many hours. This also made me realize that when you want something very badly for yourself but still you give that to others being totally selfless, you receive lot of divine/god’s grace and blessings.Another experience happened in 2008 December shivir/ spiritual camp. The third day of the shivir/spiritual camp I felt and experienced infinite love flowing within me, which was infinitely blissful. I experienced, felt and realized that the whole creation is made out of this pure divine love energy. I felt as if there is nothing but love everywhere and in everything. This went on for many hours & then I prayed to babaji & all the spiritual masters, “This experience is great but I don’t want this, I want mukti/liberation, I want this ‘I’ to dissolve, this self to dissolve completely”.I have shared many more experiences in my book.My book and blog details are given in my profile.","47,950 followers",Jedidiah Benhur Margoschis Wisely,4.9K,168,18.3M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Federal-spending-on-NASA-peaked-at-4-41-of-GDP-in-1966-and-now-its-around-a-tenth-of-that-Given-that-space-exploration-has-been-a-huge-driver-of-technological-development-would-it-make-sense-to-increase-funding-if
