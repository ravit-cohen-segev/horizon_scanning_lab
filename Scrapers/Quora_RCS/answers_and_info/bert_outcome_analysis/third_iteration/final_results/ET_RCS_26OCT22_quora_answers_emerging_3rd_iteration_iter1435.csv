But1 IntroductionThe four items in the Answer of Russell Boone below are the four great Chinese inventions generally accepted in the West. But2 The Invention of Credit Creation For Productive Investments in the Northern Song Empire (960-1126) by Wang Anshi (1021–1086)The historical importance of the Chinese master economist Wang Anshi is partially recognised in the entries made in Wikipedia (Wang Anshi’s significance on the creation of a competent Chinese bureaucracy has been discussed in recent academic articles such as Wolfgang Driesler’s three articles published inhttps://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09540962.2013.817125?src=recsys&journalCode=rpmm20https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09540962.2014.920195https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09540962.2015.1047264But while Wang Anshi is recognised as a great innovative economist who used his power to limit the exploitation of the poor by the rich and establishing the first rudiments of the Welfare State in the Southern Song Empire, by establishing a basic income for the unemployed and the old, and hospitals for the poor and homes for orphans, the modern Western recorders of these actions list what he did, but fail to understand how he did it.2.1 Wang Anshi (1021–1086) Was The First Investment Credit EconomistThe issue which modern interpreters fail to understand in the actions of Wang Anshi is the creation of no-cost credit creation by the central monetary authority in the Northern Song Empire. That investment credit creation was the basic driver of the emergence of the Northern Song Empire as the first high-investment, high growth, widespread prosperity, industrial economy in the world. SeeWhy Western-Trained University Economists Are Almost Completely UselessLet me illustrate precisely what I mean. When the superstrong Graphene (seeEveryone understands their perceptions through the lens of their existing education and their “knowledge”. If they do not think that a procedure - like high-growth, no-cost investment credit creation - exists, then they will be incapable of noticing it. That is why the Wikipedia and Encyclopedia Brittanica entries about Wang Anshi are not adequately informed - their authors do not have mindsets that encompass the possibility of investment credit creation. Because they do not recognise that principle, they cannot understand the higher economic growth and more full social and cultural development of the Song and Ming Empires. See the reprint ofThe Most Successful Macroeconomic Policy Of All TimeThat’s also why most learned Western comments about China are entirely wrong. Even the economists of the CIA seem incapable of reading the public debt financial data about Japan and China the right way up - that’s why they can’t perform basic accounting correctly, and can’t tell a bank liability like a bill from an asset like a mortgage, and they do not seem to be keen on having their understanding improved. SeeThe Public Debt of Japan and China – George Tait Edwards – MediumWherever Milton Friedman looked, he thought he saw the triumph of Western neo-liberalism, as in such books as2.1.1 The Mandate of HeavenNearly all modern economies have become, through the passage of time, captured by, dominated by and run for the benefit of their rich and privileged. Yet truly outstanding economies and nearly all world-dominating countries have grown to greatness through the inclusion of nearly all of their people in the process of economic development.The Chinese appear to understand this issue. Five thousand years of Chinese history illustrates it. When the Empire is ruled in the interests of all its people, the Emperor is obeying theSeeThe concept of the Mandate of Heaven is not, as it is usually represented, a theoretical concept. As Wikipedia points out“….‘The people are of supreme importance; the altars of the gods of earth and grain come next; last comes the ruler.’ ”Previously world-dominating hegemonic nations can be turned into much lesser powers- culturally, economically, socially, innovatively - by politicians running their economies only in the interests of their rich elites. This is not a theory but an explanation of what has happened to the UK and USA.ReadThe previous hegemonic leading nations of the UK and the USA have been converted into more minor states by political leaders elevating their rich above their people. It’s like turning two cultural billionaires, which had massive innovative, economic and social talents in their people into much more minor players (but still multi-capable mainly militarily millionaires) on the World stage. The rich everywhere press for the economy to serve mainly their interests, to grant taxes and higher profits from the impoverishment of the workers. Where this comes to pass, the country loses its previous prominance.2.1.2 Wang Anshi’s Effect on Three Chinese DynastiesThe Three Chinese Empires of the Northern Song (960–1127) , the Southern Song (1127–1279) and the first Ming Dynasty (1328–98) became the greatest in the world during the 11th to the 14th centuries - culturally, economically, socially, and innovately. Wang Anshi as Chancellor and then as Prime Minister Minster operated the investment-credit-creation key under the Emperor Shenzon of the Northern Song Empire.https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&source=images&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjNxpO_6PjaAhUCvBQKHSV1C4EQjRx6BAgBEAU&url=http%3A%2F%2Fslideplayer.com%2Fslide%2F4239505%2F&psig=AOvVaw3mE8_b7Vc35GBnHuKu6FcI&ust=1525961511993141The Chinese used that key to establish prosperity in these three Empires all of which were operated in the interests of2.1.3 Wang Anshi Macroeconomics and the Mandate of HeavenWang Anshi continually acted to ensure the prosperity of all the Chinese people. Some insight into Wang Anshi’s character through the 1994 research of Susan Elizabeth Edmonds is provided below, where her MA Dissertation states:“Although Wang’s character is hard to evaluate at such a distance, evidence of his moral fiber can be found in Mei Yaochen’s poem, “FromWang Anshi’s (1021-1086) seven-syllable jueju on nature themesSo Wang Anshi was a humble man, considerate and compassionate in his behaviour towards the poor, yet he had a steely resolve in his determination to destroy monopolies and replace them with several suppliers, to tax the rich appropriately, to improve the output of farms (and doubtless small enterprises) through low interest loans, to “stop the rich from grinding the faces of the poor into the dust”, and thus to create a more fair and stronger economy. Which he did.Investment credit creation by the Northern Song when Wang Anshi was Chancellor and Prime Minster produced the world’s first industrial economy in the 11th century.2.2 The Significance of What Wang Anshi DidThe same basic macroeconomic technology of no-cost investment credit creation is responsible for the high investment and rapid growth of the Chinese economy from 1975 to the present day. The economic understandings which I christened as the Shimomuran Macroeconomics of the Tokyo Consensus Zone have a long parentage, and a more full name for the many sources of these economic insights might beWang Anshi-Keynesian-FDRooseveltian-JohnKennethGalbraithian-Shimomuran-Wernerian Macroeconomics.See my Answer atSeeandhttp://londonprogressivejournal.com/article/view/1513/the-master-economist-dr-osamu-shimomura-probably-the-greatest-economist-of-the-th-century-after-john-maynard-keynesSeeWestern economists raised in the mindset of WashingtonConsensus Economics/Monetarism/ NeoclassicalEconomics/Neo-Liberalism/Austerity do not have an understanding of no-cost credit creation in their education, because no Western universities teach that alternative capitalism. SeeWhy Western-Trained University Economists Are Almost Completely UselessWestern economists are often puzzled by how such massive capital expenditures on social facilities in the Southern Song Empire or in the Zheng He great fleets could be implemented without causing inflation and social unrest.The comments made by some sources - that Zheng He’s seven Great Fleets were constructed and fitted out and manned with no deleterious effects on the Chinese economy of the great Ming Dynasty - can only be understood from the mindset of a full appreciation of the use of Wang Anshi’s no-cost Credit Creation by the post-Mongol Ming Empire in order to fund the construction and operation of these Great Fleets.It now seems nearly certain that the World’s first great industrial revolution in the Empire of the Southern Song was financed and grew to greatnessThere would have been no Yuan Dynasty, no Mongol domination of a literate China by the militarily great but culturally defective and comparatively illiterate Yuan Dynasty of Kublia Khan, no Silk Road, no stimulation of the European Renaissance through the export of the four great Chinese inventions of gunpowder and all its metal-based munitions (the iron bombs, cannon, fire lances and better weaponry), paper, printing and the compass. If the later Ming emperors had not been so afraid of another Mongol invasion they would not have diverted China’s energies into the repair and extension of the Great Wall.The Conservatives and their usual promotion of the interests of the rich and their traditional xenophobic philosophy of fear of outsiders and the elevation of tradition above innovation, and isolation above development, dominated the actions of the late 15th century Ming court. As“The Ming court was divided into many factions, most sharply into the pro-expansionist voices led by the powerful eunuch factions that had been responsible for the policies supporting Zheng Ho's voyages, and more traditional conservative Confucian court advisers who argued for frugality. When another seafaring voyage was suggested to the court in 1477, the vice president of the Ministry of War confiscated all of Zheng He's records in the archives, damning them as ""deceitful exaggerations of bizarre things far removed from the testimony of people's eyes and ears."" He argued that ""the expeditions of San Bao [meaning ""Three Jewels,"" as Zheng He was called] to the West Ocean wasted tens of myriads of money and grain and moreover the people who met their deaths may be counted in the myriads. Although he returned with wonderful precious things, what benefit was it to the state?""Linked to eunuch politics and wasteful policies, the voyages were over.The Great Zheng He Fleets could have formed the foundation of the Sea Silk Road covering almost precisely the same sea “road” routes of the modern OBOR development. China had the option of becoming the world-leading hegemony based on its industrial strength and the high levels of wealth and welfare of its people soundly based upon the towering levels of invention and innovation in its people. The dominance of China's Conservatives resulted in the destruction of their great navy and Chinese decline.Just as the dominance of the 1980s Conservative agenda of Reagan and Thatcher - and their promotion of the interests of the rich above the majority of their people, along with the continual destruction (from 1880 onwards) of the local banking systems which created the economic miracles of the Scottish and English industrial revolutions and FDR’s 1938–44 economic miracle - generated the economic decline of the West, so the turning inward of the Ming Empire under the Chinese Conservatives ended the potential Chinese domination of the world economy and its retreat into isolationism.As the great Quora AnswererSeeIf the Chinese had kept turning outward, China could have remained the paramount world-connected culture exceeding all others. But the dominance of the Conservatives turned Chinese policies inward, into a Sinn Fein “Us Alone” isolationist culture of “we don't need anything outside of China” which policy has never worked anywhere, as again Hoang Nghiem has argued.At present the very rich Chinese outside China -their foreign billionaires - appear to be trying to convert the Government of China into a country that serves the interests of the Chinese rich, just like what happens in the rest of the world, in the Western Washington Consensus/(Etc) Zone. If that well-funded attempt to change Chinese Government policy ever succeeds, then Chinese economic growth would fall to about a third of its current level, and China would join the rest of the world with the increasing impoverishment of its people. This appears to have historically occurred in China whenever the leadership of China fell to its Conservatives.SeeThere are modern echoes and interesting parallels to modern times in that Independent article.Wang Anshi was the first investment credit economist. He not only produced, through no-cost credit creation, the world’s first industrial industrial revolution in the Southern Song Empire but also after the fall of the Yuan/Mongol Empire, which fell partly due to untargeted credit creation which caused inflation, and after the Mongols were ejected, Wang Anshi’s insights during the succeeding Ming Dynasty funded the Great Fleet.The entries in the various encyclopaedias need to make the investment credit connection between Wang Anshi’s 11th century understandings as the foundation for the current great growth of China. Their editors may ultimately get around to doing that.3 The Better Design of the Ming Dynasty Zheng He Ships in the Great Fleet3.1 The New Zheng He Design of ShipsSketch of Zheng He Great Fleet Ship Design 1 - the largest treasure ships.The small ship in the above drawing appears to be one of Columbus’s ships, the Santa Maria, drawn to scale for comparison purposes. According to Wikipedia, the Santa Maria was 62 feet long and had a keel length of 41 feet, but Encyclopedia Brittanica states that ship was 117 feet long. No matter whatever source is correct, the flagship of the Columbus voyages was much smaller than the largest Chinese treasure ships, which were 440 feet long.SeeModern precise re-creation of the Zheng He Fleet Design 2As“To service seven different tributary missions abroad, the Nanjing shipyards constructed two thousand vessels from 1403 to 1419, which included the largeSame Ship, from a different angle.The Great Fleets had seven voyages,of which two were voyages of discovery and two for revisiting. The leaders and ambassadors were so impressed by these fleets that they often visited China by joining the fleet and some subsequent voyages (numbers five and six) had the objective of returning heads of state and ambassadors to their home countries.Source: Derived from theThe Ming Voyages | Asia for Educators | Columbia University3.2 The Echo Of That Design In The Three Ships Used By ColumbusThat design of raised fore and aft decks is obvious in the three ships Columbus used in his journeys to America (of course, he insisted it was India he had “discovered” and had a gibbet mounted on the deck of his ship to kill sailors who disagreed).The ships Columbus used on his voyage of “discovery”Encyclopedia Brittanica Image of the Santa MaríaSanta MaríaReplica of theDietrich Bartel3.3 Raised fore and aft decks on Magellan’s Ship of Discovery, the Nao VictoriaHere is an image of a modern reconstruction of Magellan’s ship, which illustrates that it was similarly designed3.4 The Same Kind Of Ship Design in the Mayflower.4 Conclusions4.1 The Great Significance of Wang Anshi’s Invention of Investment Credit Creation Economics4.2 The Raised Fore and Aft Decks on the Zheng He Ships4.3 ObservationThe Zheng He fleets were like an entire Chinese village going to sea. These ships carried large amounts of fresh water for drinking and washing and a wide range of foods and seeds which prevented scurvy in their crews.Scurvy was the scourge of the European “voyages of discovery.” It is a pity that the Chinese understanding of the protection against scurvy did not travel along the land based Silk Road and the cure had wait for James Lind’s discoveries in the 18th century and their application in the British Navy after 1800.
