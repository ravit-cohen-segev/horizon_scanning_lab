If so, then here are some of my thoughts to share with you. I have over 40-years of engineering experiences with more than 10-yrs in energy storage and have a patent on a new generation of supercapacitors using nano-materials (that just confirms that I know very little about energy storage, galactically).Around the 1975’sh, Bell Labs announced a new lithium-polymer battery that uses a solid polymer material as the electrolyte and separator. So, it is pliable. As an avid hiker, I designed conformal backpack frame using this new battery. The polymer electrolyte was not for high-temperatures, so applications were limited to temperatures less than 150°F (66°C). I don’t recall its specific-energy, but it was better than anything else on the market, including NMH. For some reason, no one wanted to license this technology, at that time. The Chinese later used the Li-polymer term to mean Li-ion pouch cells or Li-Poly.Today, we have LCO, LMO, NMC LFP, NCA and LTO as popular Li-ion chemistries. Each with different performance characteristics, but none are above 300 Wh/kg. The upcoming metal-air batteries are projected to be over 800 Wh/kg or more, but cycle-life is still around 100–150 (not current numbers). For some applications, that’s good enough.Beyond metal-air, I see a hybrid of metal-air and EDLC (supercapacitors) using graphene nanoribbons; and guesstimating that the specific-energy will be over 1,000 Wh/kg and specific-power to be over 10kW/kg. Best of all, recharging time can be less than a few minutes for large power packs, and cycle-life to be more than 10,000+. Cell phone charging should take less than 10-seconds.These are plausible and potentially-promising future battery technologies.Beyond that, the crystal ball becomes cloudier.",410 followers,Timothy Rowe,659,1.2K,2.1M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-most-promising-future-battery-technologies

They’re pocket-sized, battery powered personal computers with wireless network peripherals. The last vestiges of “phone” technology is perhaps the circuit-switched voice connection, which ended with 3G cellular radio, a technology that’s end-of-lifed by most network providers, with sunsetting maybe starting soon (Verizon was going to pull the “plug” by January of 2020, but they gave it an extra year).You might also note that these pocketPhones are dead.

Well, let’s take a look at what made the smartphone so successful as a personal computer itself. There was a time, when I was a kid at least, when a computer wasThis changed fundamentally with the personal computer. The personal computer wasPocket computers started a bit before smartphones, but once you got smartphones, personal computing changed fromSo asking where smartphones are going is essentially the same thing as asking where personal computing is going. The easy answer: bigger, better, faster, more. Bigger not necessarily a matter of size of of scope — you can buy a $50 smartphone today, and you can buy a $2500 smartphone. Every year, some company or another tries out a new peripheral or two. Apple put a scanning LIDAR device in the iPhone 12 Pro… a bunch of companies made folding phones. Those that are well received get accepted by the public catch on, the others, not so much. But smartphones, like PCs before them, are mature enough that you don’t see too many big jumps in technology anymore. Which is not a bad thing given the cost of upgrades… unless you’re one of the companies making them.Nathan BrittWe see this with smartwatches, too. They do afford a bit of additional convenience over the phone. Actually, before the pandemic, I wasn’t very kind to the idea of the smartwatch: do I really need to save myself the arduous journey of my hand to my pocket. But since I got a smart watch (a simple one, the Honor Magic Watch 2), I’ve reconsidered. The smartwatch means I can answer phone calls without the “where did I leave my phone” question, I can enter those 2-way authentication codes, etc. It’s really the same thing asBut I specifically mentioned Nathan because he brought up smart glasses. We saw that with Google’s Glass project. Everyone thinks Google Glass just vanished, but in fact, no, it didn’t. The Google Glass Enterprise Edition 2 still exists, for various business uses. It’s still very much a first step. Glass gives you Android, a low resolution heads-up display at the periphery of one eye, a camera, and a small battery built into a pair of glasses. So it’s basically a very low end smartphone-like device, the main advantage being that it’s hands-free. This wasn’t ever going to be a hit, in this form, with consumers. But you have to start somewhere.The other end of the spectrum is the Microsoft HoloLens. This is a $3,500 PC for your head that, oh-by-the-way, offers full augmented reality by way of scanning lasers creating a visual overlay. And yet, even the HoloLens isn’t perfect… the eye box (the area of overlapping image) is about 52 degrees in HoloLens 2… you can fall off the edge of your AR pretty easily. But it’s a full fledged, smartphone-like computer, containing a Snapdragon 850, typical phone RAM and Flash, etc. But it’s bulky and weights over 0.5kg.And still, this one’s important because it’s not justThis would affect other products, too. When I can call up a virtual monitor tha floats wherever I want it, at sufficient resolution, my need for real monitors is greatly reduced. And the whole concept of an operating system changes. Rather than calling up apps from a menu, our most-used apps will present at virtual objects in our environment. Move from the livingroom to the kitchen, office, car, etc. and you’ll have different virtual objects, representing the ask-for apps useful in those situations. But we’ll also have more automatic apps, things that engage based on what we’re doing.And it’s quite possible that’s a large a change as the smartphone was in the first place. If not fundamentally more. Give that device five years of mainstream use and the idea of picking up a screen will look as quaint as a person typing into a big desktop computer does today (he says, typing into his big desktop computer).The problem, of course, is in the details: how do we get an advanced computer, display, radio, and battery into a thing you’re going to be willing to wear for 8–12 hours a day? How much of our regular set of smartphone peripherals migrate there? And how will society react in an era when pretty much everyone might be recording everything all the time (because we will for AR, the computer analyzing what we see, even if we don’t save it). We’ll be wearing these while driving… as long as it’s you and me driving and not robots, that makes all of those cellphone problems all the worse, because we’re already holding the device. The greater the actual value, the greater the impact on society and the number of new problems we’re likely to encounter and, maybe, decide to deal with.I do imagine at some point the major jump would be fromRead MoreVerizon 3G Network Shutdown","58,988 followers",Michael Wolfe,504,2K,17.3M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-kinds-of-technology-will-we-see-emerge-in-the-next-15-years
