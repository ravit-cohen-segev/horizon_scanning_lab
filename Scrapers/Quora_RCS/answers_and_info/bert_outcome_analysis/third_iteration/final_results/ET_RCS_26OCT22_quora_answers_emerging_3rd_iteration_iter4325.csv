You now pissed of every single colonist even further, made a giant bloodbath and killed the farmers and workers of the colonies. You (as a Overlord) are never gonna see taxes or goods delivered, you will have regular crimes against the crown, your soldiers are under constant risk and you need to have even more troops stationed.Furthermore what did the British lose while giving the US up? They didn’t lose all that much income, they didn’t lose their navy or any major trade routes (the 13 Colonies where basically blockaded and trade was hard for the next 50 Years) and they didn’t lose their influence in North America. Canada belonged to them as well as big parts of the Caribbean (which at that time was the most important part of the Americas due to its trade value). France didn’t grow stronger fighting it. The USA NEVER sent any large amounts of ships, men, or goods to the French when they where fighting against the British afterwards. They simply went isolationist.So once it became apparent that this movement was in fact the majority (from the people who cared about it). There really was nothing to win for the British and only a minor thing to lose.The only reason why they still fought with considerable amounts of manpower where the French. Imagine if China declared war against the US and the US would back down. You lose all reputation and all your “might” that you build up over the years. Britain simply had to fight against its biggest rival and put up a fight to not be mocked and completely disrespected by any other najor or minor nation in the world.And one more classification.

10,"As a preliminary,As a preliminary,Sacrificing so much for nothing counts as a loss by any objective standard.  The US killed more Vietnamese than Vietnamese killed Americans, but that's irrelevant.  We went into Vietnam in order to accomplish something other than simply running up a high body count of unarmed or poorly armed Third Worlders.  We spent a lot and sacrificed a lot in order to accomplish that something.  That something wasn't accomplished.  Ergo, ""loss"".As to why we lost, myriad reasons, but the most important one is that our enemies simply wanted it more than we did, and were willing to endure far more punishment and make far greater sacrifices to achieve their goals than we were willing to endure and make to accomplish ours.  It was their country at the end of the day, and we were a foreign armed presence in a country whose national identity and history revolves around and was shaped by a 1000+ year struggle against armed foreign hegemony.For the average Vietnamese arrayed against us, the sacrifice necessary to get rid of the armed foreigner in their country was worth it, while for the average American the sacrifice necessary to prop up a corrupt and inept government in some far off place eventually became too much.There were also moral factors - Americans never collectively rallied around and supported this war because much of the country couldn't bring itself to see America as the good guys in Vietnam.  For the good reason that we really were not the good guys:First, we started our involvement by supporting the French in their fight to hold on to their colony.  So in a fight between a foreign colonizing power trying to maintain its hegemony vs an occupied colonized people fighting for their freedom, we sided with the oppressor and against the oppressed underdog.Second, after the Viet Minh defeated the French and liberated their country, we prevented free democratic elections from taking place because we knew the winner would be Ho Chi Minh and his Viet Minh, whom we opposed.  I.e.; we stood in the way of democracy/ were anti-democracy.Third, we ensured that instead of a unified country, which was the clear will of the majority (a majority will we made sure would never get expressed in the polls by preventing elections from taking place), Vietnam was split between a nationalist North which, commie or not, had successfully fought to free their country from foreign occupation, and a corrupt US stooge government in the South with little popular support or legitimacy.Fourth, we killed a few million Vietnamese when points one through three resulted in the inevitable war for reunification.  And the reunification, by the Viet Minh, still happened despite all our efforts.And our military's treatment of the Vietnamese throughout was often unconscionable, such as in theThere were good wars this country fought, and some iffy ones.

You could even argue it happened much earlier than that. The north/south split was a major and long lasting issue dating back to our founding.The split was so severe that dating back to 1830s, members of Congress would arm themselves on the Senate floor out of genuine fear of getting attacked. This was 30 years before the war. Senators genuinely felt another senator may try to kill him. We have members of Congress bringing arms to Washington today, but it's not the same. They are doing it for optics. They don't genuinely believe Nancy Pelosi or Mitch McConnell are going to shoot them from the dais.This came to a head in 1856 where one member of the house tried to kill a senator. He beat him within inches of his life.We play it off today as quippy anecdote. LOL those silly senators. This is because we're so far removed from that setting that it's impossible for us to genuinely believe this was an attempted murder.During the attack, Charles Sumner was unable to see because he was blinded by the amount of blood flowing over his face. He was eventually knocked unconscious. The other guy continued to beat him anyway.This wasn’t a the result of a temper tantrum. It wasn't some random act. He came there that day to walk up and kill him. He chose a cane because it would be far more humiliating. He was correct, fact it was a cane is exactly why we don't take this event seriously today.The attacker’s allies on the Senate floor even formed a blockade around the two. They were brandishing pistols and threatened to shoot anyone who tried to intervene as pleaded to spare his life. We nearly had a full blown gunfight between congressmen.Eventually, some of Sumner’s allies were able to break through the wall. Cooler heads prevailed, no shots were fired, and the situation didn’t escalate. By this point Sumner's unconscious body was beaten so much the cane had broken into several pieces. This wasn't a simple stick. It was a genuine club with a metal top. One of the many errors in the political cartoon above is it depicts him holding the metal top and striking with the wood. All accounts of the event agree he was striking Sumner over the head with the metal portion of the cane.Sumner survived but needed three years to recover. It is suspected that he suffered brain inquiries. His attacker had to pay a fine and even got reelected.Sumners opponents made commemorative rings out of the broken cane. They proudly wore these on the Senate floor. The man who almost killed him was given many more canes afterward as tokens of appreciation and encouragement. He not only escaped punishment but people thanked him for nearly killing a fellow member of Congress on the Senate floor.The conditions that allowed this outrageous event to take place were quite extreme. Yet, we were still five years away from civil war.A review of the history of the American government and you’ll see that the US was fending off civil war for many decades before it actually happened. Many of the actions of our government in the hundred years leading up the war was about finding solutions to prevent the country from splitting. Most people in government who were either attempting to start or prevent a civil war were deceased by the time the war began. None of the people who fought the war were alive when the possiblity of one first came to light.Looking at things now, yes it looks quite bad. The situation is certainly much worse than 20–30 years ago. This makes a lot of people scream for the hills with “zomg civil war is on the horizon.” It’s not. We’re not even close. What happened was we’d gotten along so unusually and atypically well for such a long time that we’ve lost perspective.This is the norm. Our founding fathers drank heavily and regularly got in fights with each other. They slandered each other in the press. Not just on policy but personal attacks as well. When Burr killed Hamilton in a duel, Burr was the standing Vice President and Hamilton was our top military officer. That's the equivalent of Kamala Harris killing the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.It's just insane how the US was the truly the wild wild west even before the wild wild west. Andrew Jackson also killed many people in duels. Hamilton's son was killed in a duel as well. Nor were they even polite to each other. When John Adams was president, his rivals openly addressed him as a fatass at formal occasions. Can you imagine if Obama introduced Trump at his inauguration as President Fatass? That's just an impossibility today but used to be the norm.We’re also nowhere close to the kind of strife and disunity found in the decades leading up to the civil war. Civil War doesn’t come out of anywhere. It requires lengthy animosity to drive people to both take opposing sides as well as happily take up arms against each other.We have our issues, but they are standard issues. Even if enough of the population wanted to fight each other today, which sides would they be on? Where would they be located? There's no geographic majorities anywhere in the US. California and Texas are as divided as the US itself is. Maybe that kind of solidarity can happen. But you gotta remember there was a clear divide of slave vs non slave states in the civil war that doesn't exist anymore.Getting a lot of comments where people claim were still on the verge of war but they aren't accounting for logistics. Take California. While they vote about 60% democrat, most people choose not to vote. Recent polls have only 49% of the population identifying with the Democratic party. So let's say all 49% of those people felt strongly enough about their beliefs to kill other Americans (spoiler, they don't) and start a civil war.Well then they'd have to imprison or kill at least 1/3 of their state government officials. They'd also have to suppress their own population. They'd have their hands full with deportations and internment camps.Their water is pumped in from Colorado and their electricity comes from the national grid. So they'd first have to solve their own water and electricity issues. Which they wouldn't be able to do, at least not without a good decade of preparation. There's so many dependencies from businesses to food distribution that California would look post apocalyptic within a month of declaring independence. Most businesses would fall, many others would leave. Nor did California have their own military nor the capacity to create one on the fly.People who believe we’re on the verge of civil war need to read more history and gain some better perspective. Maybe if things continue, it could lead to some civil unrest but not civil war. Historians could perhaps look at this period as the beginning stages of a civil war. But that war would be so far in the future most of us won’t be alive to witness it.",UNKNOWN,Danielle,536,24.3K,16.9M,2016,https://www.quora.com/What-would-technological-innovation-look-like-if-the-United-States-lost-the-Revolutionary-War
