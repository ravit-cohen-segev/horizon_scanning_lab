The camera in a smartphone is one of many different peripherals in your phone. The whole camera assembly typically costs around $20-$35, and it’s inherently a compromise.It’s a market reality that a phone has to be no more than about 7–9mm thick to be accepted as a premium device. There’s absolutely no reason to make a real camera that way. Very specifically, the lens on just about any real camera, from a low end point and shoot, a high end bridge camera like this Sony RX10 here, or the many lenses for system cameras are far more sophisticated than those of a smartphone.Smartphones also use multiple cheap camera chips to get around the problem with their lenses. Every main camera on every smartphone is a wide angle lens, about a 75-degree diagonal field of view, equivalent to about a 28mm lens on a full frame camera. This is done to allow a 4–5mm lens to be used along with the tiny sensor, clearly shorter than the thickness of the phone. In order to get a normal or even telephoto camera in a smartphone, they might use a slightly longer lens, but they’ll shrink the sensor as well. This is why, on 2-camera iPhones, you can’t use the portrait camera in low light — it would give you a terribly noisy result, being a slower lens and smaller sensor than the main camera.The closest a point & shoot camera gets to a smartphone is at the relatively low end. A few companies sell very low end, $100 cameras, but most of those are older models. There is little point in making a P&S camera that’s not better in at least some way than a premium smartphone. When you go up a notch, like this Canon Powershot SX740HS, you’ll find a 1/2.3″ sensor, most of the time, which is only a bit larger than the 1/2.6″–1/3″ sensors used in most smartphones. At the widest angle, your premium phone will have a faster lens and probably outshoot the P&S camera, but most of these have crazy long zoom lenses, which will deliver Facebook-friendly shots at quite some distance. Not comparable to a pro system or the aforementioned Sony, but something a phone simply cannot do.The closest thing to a real camera using smartphone technology is the Light L16 camera. Light is not a traditional camera company, they’re a startup, and their stated goal is to deliver a DSLR-like result from a somewhat pocketable camera. To do this, they have 16 different 1/3.2″ cameras: five wide angle, five medium telephoto, and six long telephoto. They deliver the telephoto not by shrinking the sensor even more, but by using mirrors and folded optical paths. It’s still quite a bit thicker than any modern smartphone, and the result is nowhere near that of a DSLR, but it’s an interesting science experiment.The SoftwareBoth real digital cameras and smartphones have been evolving additional features, including things like computational photography, in which the on-board CPU is going more and more for the shooter. Even before smartphones were ever concerned about competing with real cameras for “keeper” photographs, P&S cameras developed “smart” exposure systems, which were based on multiple sensors and exposure libraries, or expert systems. Some smartphones have leapfrogged that, using even more sophisticated AI for exposure determination.One thing to consider as well is that smartphone and camera photography have a fundamental difference, especially when you look to more serious cameras. I’m typing this while I’m importing photos from memory cards, actually from a Sony RX10 Mark IV and an Olympus TG5, two cameras I took with me on the vacation that ended yesterday. The only thing I care about when shooting photos on these cameras is getting the best possible image capture. Anything that helps me get a better capture is worth having on my camera. But I’m shooting raw images on both of these cameras and will edit them with professional tools on my PC here, which has potentially a thousand times the overall resources of a camera or a smartphone system (RAM, CPU, FPU, GPU, etc). I have no interest in finalizing a photo on my camera.For a phone, you have the camera, the computer, the digital darkroom apps, and the delivery mechanism, WiFi or Cellular, all in one place. You’re not likely to be as sophisticated about your next Instagram photo as I am when I composite 50+ raw images into a larger whole, but most phone shooters work only on the phone. So they need the kinds of photo tools that don’t exist on cameras.And sure, some models often have a few of the things you can find on smartphones, like “creative filters”. My Olympus Pen F takes this kind of to an extreme by including a color control knob, right on the front. This allows fast switching between color and B&W film emulations, “ART” filters, and other special settings. It’s sophisticated enough to allow color filtering in-camera, much as if I slapped a color filter on the lens. I haven’t seen anything quite like this on smartphone apps, but there’s probably one that does it. Being software, you can more or less call it coevolution, as camera markers improve ideas based on what they’ve seen in apps, and app writers add things that were useful in real cameras.There have been a few cases of direct cross pollination from phone to camera. There have been a few real cameras, as well as phone-camera hybrids like the Samsung Galaxy Zoom series, which use Android and, of course, work with just about any Android camera app. That’s one direct import of smartphone tech into cameras, but it’s not widespread.Another are apps. Sony has supported apps for a number of their camera systems (not the RX10 Mark IV just yet), both free and paid. Many of these are, as I suggested, useful for getting the shot more than editing on camera, but certainly both kinds exist. For example, one of the popular apps is an Intervalometer, a program that lets you shoot repeated shots, for time-lapse photography. I have had external hardware for that function on all of my recent pro cameras, so I rekon if my RX10 had apps, I’d have downloaded that one, just in case.",5 followers,Bill Otto,7.6K,7.5K,43.3M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Which-cameras-utilize-the-same-similar-technology-as-in-the-top-smartphones

It has 32 megapixels.I did the same digital zoom with my DSLR. Mind you, it only has 18 megapixels. There are a couple of take aways here. With the tiny lens, all those megapixels do not get you a clearer picture. And the cellphone picture is very highly processed to look sharper when it just doesn’t have the detail you would expect from so many pixels. If you are really sharp you will notice that the DSLR did not automatically hide the chromatic aberration in the above picture. That is something usually done in post processing on the computer.Now, I just rotated my zoom lens to a longer focal length and took another picture.You still think that a cellphone image matches up to a DSLR?Look at this building in the cell phone.It’s pretty unrecognizable and the phone went basically to black and white.Here is the DSLR. Can you argue that the cell phone is anywhere near professional quality when we are comparing to a new phone to a twelve-year-old starter DSLR APS-C frame with a kit lens? A flagship Canon full frame DSLR with a prime lens would blow even the bottom picture away. By the way, I did not do any processing on the DSLR images and I have the camera set for minimal sharpening and minimal noise reduction and output jpeg files. If I had taken raw images into Photoshop, the difference would be another quantum leap.Or, in other words, if all you ever want to do is take snapshots for social media, your cellphone is all you need.

Depending on just how high-end you get, a high-end camera sensor can capture 10x-180x as much light as a phone sensor. That’s sticking to conventional digital cameras, not anything consideredYes, smartphones have been improving their photographic ability, adding better plastic lenses, more cameras, etc. But any new hardware technology going into a smartphone can be used in a larger-sensor camera as well. So sure, if you compare a smartphone of today to a professional digital camera from 2000, you’ll probably be happier with the smartphone for many uses. However, that professional camera still has the advantage of being able to change lenses, adapting itself to situations a smartphone can’t hope to match.Smartphones are currently shooting a bit above their pay grade by using computational photography and artificial intelligence. There is actually nothing in any smartphone, by way of image processing features, that couldn’t be implemented in a professional camera. However, novices and professionals do not use a camera in the same way, so it’s unreasonable to expect identical features.In the smartphone, the goal is to take over the functions of the photographer’s brain for a novice who doesn’t have access to a photographer’s experience and training. That means an AI to decide on an image’s exposure, maybe another to coordinate taking multiple shots based on image content or motion feedback/sensing. Then, once the photo is shot, another chunk of code analyzes the image and adjusts it — probably for display on the phone or on the internet, specifically — and then encodes it as a JPEG.When I take a photo with a professional camera, I’m going to have the camera’s opinion of the exposure, a preview of it in my electronic viewfinder, and my own knowledge of photography, of this camera, etc. to choose the final exposure. The electronics are offering me a suggestion, not making a decision for me. I know photography better, but even more importantly, I know my specific photographic intent when I press that button. Even if there’s an AI helping me out, it doesn’t know that intent. Well… not completely. Lots of cameras know you’re trying to get sharp focus on eyes. At least one other can be told you’re looking for classes of vehicles in terms of autofocus specialization.And that’s again one of those things that’s offering help. Focusing decisions can be too fast to make on your own, in some cases. So it’s great to have a camera with a reliable enough ability to focus on what I’m intending to focus on. Sometimes I force that using spot focus, sometimes I let the camera pick out the eyes, sometimes I just do it all manually. My choice — the camera doesn’t get in the way. You can do that on a smartphone in manual mode, but it’s usually awkward, and sometimes not even an option in the manufacturer’s default app.My cameras have a number of computational functions, but again, they’re oriented toward helping me get the shot. The presumption is that, in most cases, I’m shooting raw images which I’ll edit/finish later on a PC. So the camera’s not concerned with much of that. Well, most of them aren’t… I do own one camera that has an amazing amount of control of the image you’ll record in JPEG. But it’s still control I have, not decisions being made for me.Another factor is fast shooting. One of my cameras can record 30 shots before I even press the button. It can shoot 18 frames per second with full image stabilization and continous autofocus, or 60 frames per second with one-shot autofocus. Is that more than I need? Nearly always. But even in single shot mode, it’s effectively instant no matter how quickly I press the shutter button. Your typical phone camera is laggy, never intended for the sort of applications that need fast shooting, high end DSLRs have storage specifically designed for a high rate of image storage.And then there’s adaptabiliy to any situation. My camera with the right lens can shoot a closeup of the moon, or a closeup of a bug. When the memory card is full, I can put in another… or two. When the battery runs out, I can put in another. Or add an accessory grip and use two batteries. The typical modern smartphone is going to fill up on photos or run out of power. They will never even match a typical consumer point-and-shoot on flexibility. My camera is designed to have a flash gun fitted or link to an array of flash lights.So, bottom line is, what’s better for you, not what’s better on an absolute basis. If you just want perfectly good snapshots for the internet, a smartphone will handhold you better than any dedicated camera. It’s common, and probably will be increasingly more common, for a beginner to learn photography using a phone camera and find, if they get a real camera, they’re not getting better results. Possibly even worse. There is an absolute need to master a professional camera. Anyone can pick up a phone and get the same technical result as anyone else using the same phone, because the phone makes all the decisions. However, the creative result? That’s up to you… for a while, anyway.",907 followers,Manohar Batra,18.3K,150,2.6M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Which-cameras-utilize-the-same-similar-technology-as-in-the-top-smartphones

I was born in mainland China, and I studied in high school and did not go to university.The Chinese-language Wikipedia entry on the “Tver-Moscow War” edited by Zhemao, has been deleted from WikipediaBeginning in 2010, Zhemao posted entries with false stories related to the historical figure of Heshen, an infamously corrupt Qing Dynasty official.Eventually Zhemao had to create new articles to cover widening gaps in her decade-long narrative. Zhemao concocted elaborately detailed war stories and economic histories, interweaving them into real events in language boring enough to fit seamlessly into Wikipedia.Illustrations fromThe 90,000-word war story cited more than 100 references, and its ""normativeness"" was comparable to academic papers. In addition, the author also drew a map of the battlefield situation. More than that, ""there are 10,000 freemen working with 30,000 slaves in the Kashin Silver Mine"", ""20,000 pikemen, 12,000 crossbowmen, 5,000 boyars in the Moscow-Kazan campaign"" Installed cavalry and 18 bronze cannons"", and even ""Ryazan Kaya, a currency with a silver content of 92.7%"", the data is detailed and the description is meticulous, it is really hard to distinguish the true from the false.How was Zhemao able to keep her historical fiction off the radar? The secret lies in the hundreds of characters created in depicting the war between the Tatars and the Russians.Combining historical facts and fiction, it described in detail the mutual killing, infighting, rebellion, and siege of the garrisoned troops and Tatar rebels in various parts of Russia. In the end, the war ended with the leader being beheaded and the rebels defeated.Most remarkable is that no one knew about this, until fairly recently, when another author, Yihan, a fantasy novelistSilver coinage fromYifan went down the rabbit hole on the Kashin mine and the Tver-Moscow War, learning about battles, the personalities of aristocrats and engineers, and more history surrounding the forgotten mine. There were hundreds of related articles (206), describing this obscure period of Slavic history in the dull, sometimes suggestive, tone of the online encyclopedia.Russian-language versions of articles related to the period were shorter than the Chinese equivalents, or nonexistent.It turns out that one woman has been writing 'Fictitious Russian History' on Wikipedia for 10 years, and there are voices saying 'I should be a novelist'After the fraud was exposed, Zhemao stated in an apology letter:that she was a high school graduate who was unemployed at home, and that all the entries she wrote were ""fantasy literature”. Most of her fake entries were created to cover gaps left by her first couple of entries she edited. “As the saying goes, in order to tell a lie, you must tell more lies. I was reluctant to delete the hundreds of thousands of words I wrote, but as a result, I wound up losing millions of words, and a circle of academic friends collapsed,” she wrote. “The trouble I’ve caused is hard to make up for, so maybe a permanent ban is the only option. My current knowledge is not enough to make a living, so in the future I will learn a craft, work honestly, and not do nebulous things like this any more.”She went on proudly acknowledge that she single-handedly created one of the largest hoaxes in the history of Wikipedia, earning her the online nickname, “Chinese Borges.”As of June 17, most of the fictitious historical entries created by Zhemao on Chinese Wikipedia have been deleted, according to an official statement.",13 followers,Vishal Upadhyay,9.5K,52,717.9K,2022,https://www.quora.com/Which-cameras-utilize-the-same-similar-technology-as-in-the-top-smartphones

This is calledThe present radiative forcings of each greenhouse gas (compared to their greenhouse effects in pre-industrial times) are:3: Energy absorbed through CO2Since CO2 makes up 1.5 watts/m2 out of the total radiative forcings of 2.6 watts/m2. Thus, at present, carbon dioxide is responsible for 55% of the anthropogenic greenhouse effect, methane is responsible for 18%, nitrous oxide, water vapor and halocarbons for 9% each.This is easy to understand.4: The consequencesThis leads to a cascading greenhouse effect that takes decades to centuries to come into full effect:Due to this effect, a 1% increase in energy absorption results inThis is where we are at right now and this cascading effect is not reversible for several hundred years even if we stopped all CO2 emissions now, since it takes 200 years on average for CO2 to be reabsorbed by the surface or by the oceans.With another doubling of CO2, we can look at a total increase of 10% in energy absorption. Here is what happens when the sun delivered 10% more energy in the past. It led to an average temperature increase of 4 degrees Celcius.A temperature increase of 4 degrees would make the home of 90% of the world’s population uninhabitable and destroy 90% of arable land.Potentially moving to newly thawn land on the poles is also not feasible, because it takes5: What it is notOne of the popular arguments is that water vapor is responsible for the greenhouse effect. It is responsible for 60% of the greenhouse effect, but we cannot contribute to it via human emissions, because human water vapor emissionsThe only way we can contribute to it, is through increased CO2, which heats up oceans and increases water vaporization that goes into the atmosphere.Methane is also a strong greenhouse gas, in fact it is 84 times stronger by volume than CO2. However, its concentration is 250 times less than that of CO2 (0.00017% vs 0.04%). That’s why its contribution to climate change is 5 times less than that of CO2 (4% vs. 26%).Secondly, 80% of the Methane disappears from the atmosphere within 25 years on average while it takes 250 years for 80% of the CO2.So, if we reduced Methane emissions drastically, we would already remove most of its greenhouse effect. However, even if we reduced all CO2 emissions drastically right now, we would not see a reduction of the greenhouse effect and experience the entire cascading effect of CO2 for 200 years.That’s why CO2 is such a bigger problem than Methane or any other greenhouse gas.Read more about this here.This chart also shows how much the increase in those greenhouse gases increased their heat trapping.Here, just some more of those arguments that shows just how little effort is put into fact-checking:You’ve seen that people jump on sound bites like “CO2 is a heavy gas that sinks”, “medival warm period”, believe blatantly fake data without any doubt or fact-checking.This is the oldest technique in the book of pseudo-science, overwhelming the reader with 50 arguments, using scientific words and it works, so that they think it’s true and don’t fact check them.SummaryEarth receives 324 watts/m2 of energy from the sun constantly.Of those 324 watts, a total of 235 watts is absorbed, 67 watts by the atmosphere, 168 by the surface, and 107 watts are reflected back into space.Greenhouse gases increase the energy absorption of sunlight by 1.1% directly compared to pre-industrial times and by 3.3% overall due to the cascading effect.This increases total absorbed watts/m2 by 7.2 watts/m2 from 235 watts to 242.3 watts/m2.This effect is not reversible even if we stopped all CO2 emissions now, since it takes CO2 200 years on average to be reabsorbed by land or by the ocean.We can only try to slow down the cascading effect.All in all, the recent climate change is man-made and these numbers prove it without a doubt.",256 followers,Priyal Gupta,9.7K,0,0,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-top-5-hoax-technologies-of-2017

As an ex-private equity guy, I think that this is a winning finanical idea.5) Supportive of ""your"" choices. You can build a $B company, a lifestyle cash flow business, or a quick flip. Their model allows for all those outcomes, or even for you to change your goals as your circumstances adjust. That flexibility is really important to an entrepreneur.As far as flaws, some people consider it a negative that 500 Startups makes so many investments. Some VCs use seed investors as ""screens"" to find great companies, and because 500 does so many investments, they might consider the social proof of a 500 company to be lower than others.To solve this, 500 Startups doubles down on winners, which is, in and of itself, a big marker.
