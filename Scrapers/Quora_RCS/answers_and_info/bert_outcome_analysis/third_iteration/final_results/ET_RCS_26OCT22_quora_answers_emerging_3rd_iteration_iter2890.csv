We’ve only had any civilization for 10k years (0.001% of that time), and only had discernible technological progress for 500 years, a comparative nanosecond.So if that technological progress were to continue for another five hundred yearsSince this is longer than the whole evolutionary path from multicellular organisms to us, it’s a pretty good bet that evolution, if “we” survive that long, would make us unrecognizable in every conceivable dimension.Since the universe is structured in a way that precludes faster than light travel, we won’t be travelling faster than light, regardless of technology.On the other hand, assuming we survive and continue to develop technology for the next 1,000 years, it’s a plausible bet that we could build colony ships able to accelerate to 5% of the speed of light. If so, we could get people to the closest potentially habitable exoplanet we know of, Proxima Centauri B, in a century or two (allowing time to speed up and slow down). The farthest potentially habitable planet we know of is Kepler 443b, which is 2,540 light years away. So we could get a colony ship there in about 100,000 years. Let’s say we launched that ship two thousand years from now, and once it landed it took the colonists 80,000 years to fully populate and inhabit the planet, about as long as it took humans to do the same once we started leaving Africa. That’s still just a sliver of time, less than 200,000 years. We’ve still got 900,800,000 years to go before worrying about the sun.Conclusion: Long before the sun becomes a problem, if we solve our other potentially fatal problems and keep at it, we will have established colonies throughout the Milky Way and wouldn’t, as a civilization, have to worry too much about the sun running out of hydrogen.","5,990 followers",Jens Böttiger,566,2.6K,17.6M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Which-country-will-have-the-most-advanced-technology-in-2021

For us to even last another million years would be extraordinary, and that would only get us 1/10 of 1 % of the way to the point one billion years from now when the planet becomes uninhabitable. It’s the height of human hubris to think we can actually make it that long.To last one billion years would require human beings to be around roughly 1,000 times longer than they already have been. I hope that puts things in perspective.If humans do somehow manage to last even another million years (and it’s a rare species that can), doubtless we’ll have established another home for ourselves on other planets in our solar system or beyond, and the sun’s aging won’t be considered a huge problem. That’s the best-case scenario. Worst-case, humans go extinct in the next 1,000 years or less, which is perhaps more likely.","68,788 followers",Kanthaswamy Balasubramaniam,898,17.3K,413.5M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Will-humans-be-able-to-reach-and-stand-on-the-sun-with-some-advanced-technologies

They’ll then tell someone about it, and sooner or later rather than being written off as a loon, someone will give them an observation that would falsify this belief. Say something as simple as “the Sun goes below the horizon, but is always above the horizon somewhere, so we can’t all share the same horizon.”The person will then put just enough thought into it to say “Hey, maybe the Sun is a spotlight, so that it doesn’t light up the entire Earth at the same time.” And they’ll go with that, until someone points out that even with that model, the Sun can’t go below the horizon. So they make up something about perspective making it appear to go below the horizon.Basically, there’s no evidence anywhere. It’s “it could work like this” all the way down, with all the other assertions not there because of any evidence, but strictly because it has to be that way otherwise the Earth isn’t flat, and on that they are certain. They never really get into “and what are the implications if it does work like that” which is the core of invention. They don’t even take their own ideas and work them out enough to make sure they correspond to reality.As an example of this, you’ve probably seen the model of a flat Earth with a sun circling above it, showing it illuminating only part of the Earth. No one suggesting that this is how it works has ever taken the time to examine this model to determine what sunrise and sunset would be at different places on the Earth and compare that to reality.For example, if you’re on the equator, you have days that are very consistently the same length, and that length is just over 12 hours of daytime and just under 12 hours of nighttime. This varies by about a minute during the course of a year. Remember that animation? Does it look like it EVER illuminates half of the equatorial region? There is nowhere they could put the Sun over a flat Earth where it would illuminate half the equatorial region without also illuminating the North Pole if you assume geography based on an",152 followers,Gurenotto Doragon,3K,627,1.2M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Which-country-will-have-the-most-advanced-technology-in-2021

A single city-state, on the other hand, lacks the base to keep modern technology going.Where's the cut off point? It's hard to say.  I suspect that a country the size of Japan or the UK could probably survive and spread its technology, and being an island nation would certainly help fend off attackers, but it would probably be centuries before they could really spread their technology.For an analysis of the smallest unit that could spread, I recommend the ""1632"" series.  It posits a single West Virginia coal mining town transported back in time to the 17th century.  They have modern technology and knowledge, but no industrial base, limited resources, and only a few thousand people.  The whole series is about them trying to survive and build a society of sufficient size and power that they can advance the rest of the world to at least a 19th century level of technology.",2 followers,Richard Muller,3.2K,2.3K,202.3M,2015,https://www.quora.com/Which-country-will-have-the-most-advanced-technology-in-2021

The island status would make sure that any contact with others and any information exchange would be on our terms, when we are ready.The country would first have to get itself into order. No global trade exists. Maybe some trade with primitive neighbors could occur. A lot of tech might have to be initially discarded depending on how self sufficient the country was. Cars for example need gasoline and importing it will be impossible. Civil order would be in near chaos for the first few years. After that its recovery starts. Society would use a mix of high tech and low tech would be used until it stabilizes. Most likely high tech like electronic manufacturing would be very limited so new electronic devices would be in short supply. Newly built manufacturing might result in older tech electronic devices as the country re learns the tech.Maybe a decade or so, the country would be ready to either conquer or guide the rest of the world. There would be a big intelligence advantage though hindsight via historical records. But dont expect it to be easy.At least initially until political alliances are solid and the world has politically and socially matured, tech transfer would be limited. Any exports or equipment used outside the country which can be used against us will initially be deliberately be difficult to understand, reverse engineer or use against us. This would avoid a repeat of japan in ww2.Some examples are in guns. The principles of most modern firearms would be easy to understand and copy if one was stolen and got into the hands of the natives and you gave them a few hundred years. But try that with solid state lasers or coilguns/gauss guns. Basically try to make it as high tech as you can. Limiting it to present tech I would recommend caseless electronically fired guns. With special sneaky features like  hidden homing beacons, non rechargeable batteries with limited lifespan (like the ones on stinger missles thet the mujahedeen have), maybe even radioactive materials which could either kill anyone opening up the mechanism or would make it easy to track.Perhaps the most important export would be the idea of the scientific method.",0 followers,Lucas Martin,6.4K,65,4.2M,2015,https://www.quora.com/Will-humans-be-able-to-reach-and-stand-on-the-sun-with-some-advanced-technologies

For quite a while after that, we were still just spending time surviving. Language is evolving, we’re doing the hunter gatherer thing. Our days were mostly consumed with subsistence and learning how to express abstraction. There was no such thing as abstraction before we came along. We had to invent how to talk about the future, plan, and communicate with other tribes without killing each other. There were lots of things to work out with this new hardware upstairs.Finally, we learned how to control plants on a wide scale, i.e. agriculture begins. That was about 10,000 years ago. At this point, we have an abundance of food and we don’t have to chase animals around the land all year. So, we’ve really only had 10,000 years to develop anything resembling technology. Before we had an abundance of calories, we were too busy surviving and figuring out what to Do with a brain like this before that.If you think what has happened in 10,000 years, it is almost mind blowing. Everything in history, everything that has ever been invented, written, or built was effectively done in the last 10,000 years. Wow, incredible!Last thing, it was really industrialization that led to the acceleration of technological development. You have to have machines to build new machines. “Machine shops”, where they build parts for other machines, took off. From the early part of last century on, we built a ridiculous number of machines and figured out how to use electricity as a power source. Remember, that’s only about 100 years ago. Another wow. So, in 100 years, we went from a light bulb to a computer doing billions of calculations a second (that’s on almost everybody’s desk top). We built a huge machine, stuck a few computers, and some bottled up fire in it, and flew some humans to our moon. In about 100 years.
