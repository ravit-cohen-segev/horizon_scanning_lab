2,"Maybe. If we understand genetics deeply enough we might change our relationship with diseases (both in what we can treat and in how we approach treatment). Conversely, are we going to cure all diseases? No, because that would include curing vulnerability to infections, toxins, and epigenetic changes.However, we actually don’t want to cure all diseases. If we were to cure all disease then we would have to determine a way for people to die, other than truly falling apart. We are not nearly smart enough to build appropriate systems for managing our role on the planet in such a scenario. We are toMaybe.

We are not nearly smart enough to build appropriate systems for managing our role on the planet in such a scenario. We are too selfish, to focused on trivial things. As a species we do not yet have the grace nor wisdom to determine how to live constructively and then get out of the way and let someone else have a turn.",12 followers,Marc Lawrence,3.2K,12.7K,148.9M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Might-we-see-a-revolutionary-technology-that-will-cure-or-change-our-relationship-with-all-diseases-in-our-lifetimes

We are constantly discovering new things about how the body works, how diseases work, and how they are affected by various ‘assaults’.",922 followers,Rajat Agarwal,556,0,0,2018,https://www.quora.com/Might-we-see-a-revolutionary-technology-that-will-cure-or-change-our-relationship-with-all-diseases-in-our-lifetimes
