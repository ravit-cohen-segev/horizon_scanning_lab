You’d need to mine at least 100 solar systems to their bones, but why not… They’d rearrange galaxies to make them pretty…One could argue, that if Type 3 controls their home galaxy, type 4 should control a cluster, or supercluster, but whatever… It is crazy one way or another.If humanity were to reach Type 4 (or even 3), Earth would be a Universal Preserve full of old, restored cities and technology. So that the humans can see how their primitive ancestors used to live, where they came from.Our future selves would probably stop the Sun from expanding, and rearanged the continents back to the original configuration in which they were, back when humans used to live on it. Why? Because they can. Also, becauseAnd Humans and other species alike would come from all around the universe, to see where did the current masters of all creation come from. They would look upon our mighty cities, and our supersonic jets in awe. Not understanding how we managed to survive in such harsh conditions.For, by the time Type 4 civilisation rolls around, living on planets will be passé.

3,"Image by Brandon J. RichardI think that a Kardashev scale III civilization, which is capable of harnessing the energy of their galaxy, would have the capability of stellar and planetary engineering. They could use it to build a planetary cloud, which would be a cloud of planets in the Largrarian L4 point of a binary system of black holes. We have such asteroids that follow, for example, Jupiter in our system, 60 degrees in front and at the back. They could also put a star or two in that system so that the planets get light.Why would they arrange planets this way?Image by Brandon J.

Instead, they might use energy more efficiently.The question was: What kind of technologies do you imagine a Kardashev 3+ civilization would have?Image from Hubble Space Telescope.

The more layers of technology leads to exponential advancement.So hypothetically take the American Civil War in 1865.Now take the US military of today.Please tell me what entered the minds of those human soldiers in the civil war.Don't even think of a fleet of drones and nuclear weapons.How long would that battle last? USA of today versus USA of 1865? Mind you I am comparing the same country here, the same racial mix,they could very well be related by blood, great great grandfathers.The battle would be over in a matter of minutes. Total surrender before total destruction. Else…It would be Armageddon.It would appear like the end of the world.Satan has finally come to take humans to Hell.God is finally showing his wrath.By 2099 humans would appear like Gods to us today. Just like those Civil War soldiers seeing Apache gunships and F22 Raptors.Once we reach Type 1. It's pretty likely we can get all the way to Type 5. See the smarter the Civilization, the more civil they become. Civilization is opposite to NATURE. It's empathy, giving, selflessness. Nature is eat or be eaten. We have to layer civilization on top of human nature. We have to become Humanistic.

6,"Of course, the others are correct in that the apes, especially chimps and gorillas would create the most advanced of civilisations, being strong and well suited for advancement, but I will point out that by far the most dangerous species would become the ants.For this scenario, let’s say all ants become hyper intelligent, but remain loyal to the colony and queen ant.Firstly, the sheer number of ants that exist on Earth.

The best estimate I could find (BBC Four) stated that there are 100 trillion ants on Earth and they have spread to every single continent on Earth. Ants are absolutely remarkable and these are some thing they have already done, without the intelligence boost this question gives them.Humans have build cities, and some intelligent animals may have cobbled together a makeshift shelter for safety, but ants have built massive colonies underground, safe from most hazards that lie above, with rooms dedicated to specific purposes like storage, mating, nurseries, farms and even garbage disposal areas like we have with landfills, all connected with tunnels that ensure good ventilation.A group of scientists unearthed an ant colony that covered over 50 square metres of space and was 8 metres deep. The colony must have moved 80 tonnes of soil to build it. This would be a New York City for the ants to build. But, we have discovered supercolonies, built by these ants, most notably the Argentine Ant. One supercolony in Europe spread across 6000 km, formed by multiple ant colonies joining and working together, with billions and billions of workers, basically forming their own countries. That’s not all. Argentine Ants from different supercolonies are sociable to other Argentine Ants from other parts of the world, essentially creating a mega-colony that has spread worldwide.Ants are also the only animals other than humans, to go to war with each other and other kinds like termites. The Army Ants of South America band together into a gigantic unit, moving as a united front and tearing through everything that cannot get away. When the Army Ants start to move, birds take off, insects flee, snakes go into the water or into their burrows, even jaguars and horses turn and run when they spot the ants.Army Ants can eat an entire horse. Compare a horse to yourself. There, you see why everything runs. Army Ants also build things with themselves. Have to cross from one tree to another? Have to cross a small stream? The Army Ants build bridges with their own bodies, ensuring no obstacle can stop their movements.Ants have also been spotted using deceptions. When two ants from different species meet in the wild, they either duke it out instantly or size each other up to see how dangerous that ant is. Ants have been seen standing on higher ground or pebbles to look bigger than their opponent. That’s not all. Ants use tactics in war too. They put the weakest and crippled ants at the front lines to suicidally charge and overwhelm the target before the larger soldiers come in to finish the target effortlessly. This prevents the valuable soldiers from being injured or killed unnecessarily. This brings me to another point. Ants act as a superorganism, not as one. They are absolutely ready to die for the colony’s survival, there is no retreat, just endless waves and waves until the ants destroy the enemy, meaning large colonies almost always destroy other insects or animals. Ant wars are pitted at massive scales, since both sides are suicidally ready to throw out millions upon millions of lives to ensure victory, like the Argentine-Fire Ant War in California, for control of not just a small area, but practically the entire state. This war has already lasted years and to my knowledge, is still ongoing.I have just given you an infodump on just how crazily similar ants are to humans and how they have thrived for longer than the dinosaurs and spread to all continents other than Antarctica. How they construct country-sized colonies and wage massive wars with tactics. How they work as one. Now, imagine they all gain intelligence. Imagine they all become as smart as humans. They would take longer to get to our standards than the apes, but they would easily become the largest threat to all the intelligent animals. The superorganism they act as ensures little room for error and no personal nature will get in the way. They could learn to construct, become deadlier, form armies to attack cities and wherever intelligent animals stay. I assume that the supercolonies could join as one, alliances between ant colonies that consist of trillions of ants could be formed and there would be no betrayal, just a ruthlessness and bravery never before seen. Ants will find ways to be resistant to pesticides and water attacks. All intelligent animals would immediately stop fighting themselves and realise just how dangerous the ants became.Then…I don’t know. Maybe World War Ants happens or something.Sources:Edit:The stretch of the 6000 km supercolony.

7,"The Kardashev scale is primarily based on a civilization capturing and utilizing various levels of energy.

To increase this number we’d need to significantly increase the efficiency of solar panels, mirror arrays, and solar capture/broadcast technologies (imagine catching sunlight in space and then sending it in a usable form to the planet via microwave). That tech and more would be required if we stick to a very strict interpretation of the scale, but if we expand to say that we can use and store theSo there you have it! We need massive increases in efficiency/utilization of current tech, development and refinement of near-future tech, and a way to harvest antimatter that doesn’t violate our current understanding of physics.
