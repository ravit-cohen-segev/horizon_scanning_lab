0,"No, wireless technologies will never transmit or distribute large amounts of energy.That’s because of 1) losses of large fractions of the kilowatts that would be beamed to your home and of the megawatts that would be transmitted from town to town and 2) the flux of power through the air would fry birds and foliage that weren’t completely transparent to the wavelength of EMF that is being transmitted.No, wireless technologies will never transmit or distribute large amounts of energy.That’s because of 1) losses of large fractions of the kilowatts that would be beamed to your home and of the megawatts that would be transmitted from town to town and 2) the flux of power through the air would fry birds and foliage that weren’t completely transparent to the wavelength of EMF that is being transmitted.",2 followers,Richard Muller,11.9K,2.3K,202.3M,2022,https://www.quora.com/Can-wireless-technology-replace-power-lines-as-an-effective-method-of-energy-distribution
1,"see when it come to technology to replace the education we can say few things , first Physical preference cannot be replaced by the virtual preference , example in educations sector when we take class in school physically students are there infront of us we can have 5 senses working at that time , but when we take class on zoom or any technological thing we have inly audio and video ie hearing and seeing only two senses , my experience being a teacher says you can never replace technology with education but you can enhance education with technology.",26 followers,Balaji Viswanathan,1.3K,5.6K,427.2M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Can-wireless-technology-replace-power-lines-as-an-effective-method-of-energy-distribution

3,"Robots will definitely replace unskilled jobs in the near future.A number of predictions (see below) have been made on the number of jobs destroyed and the number of jobs created by automation.How robots will impact your job security will depend on a number of factors.

The factors include:1. The country you live in – e.g., technologically advanced countries like Japan, Germany, Korea, etc., vs. developing countries. The country you live in will also determine how economics, unemployment rate, demographics and underemployment can impact your employment.","17,165 followers",Pascal Morimacil,4.4K,4.3K,34.7M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Can-wireless-technology-replace-power-lines-as-an-effective-method-of-energy-distribution
4,"Good, no really good. Economic output hasn’t changed, the bots are probably working three shifts too, so output could be higher. 90% of the ‘voting’ population haven’t got jobs, do you think they are going to put someone in power that allows them to enjoy their leisure time? That is exactly what I think they will do. People that work are going to get more resources (pay) but in theory we’re looking at Startrek, people can do whatever they want.This scenario is some time off! The components cost of such robots are a lot of money currently. Lets just make some assumptions to work through the numGood, no really good.

The components cost of such robots are a lot of money currently. Lets just make some assumptions to work through the numbers. A company I have work with, produces the best robotic hands on the planet, they cost $100,000+ each. Nor are they as strong as human hand either. An entire automaton, $1m+ this assumes the software is there which it is currently not, if it falls over your looking at $100,000 repair bill!My own view is whoever creates a ‘useful’ mass production robot is going to clean up. They need to bring it in at $250,000. This is",26 followers,Balaji Viswanathan,6.1K,5.6K,427.2M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Can-technology-replace-education-If-yes-or-no-why

6,"Yes they will. In fact, every possible kind of job can get replaced in a couple of decades considering the rate at which we are injecting intelligence in robots. The question is whether the market will allow that to happen. Because, every single job lost is a customer lost as well. Gradually, the inequality of the wealth distribution will increase to the most extreme point. The way we have let things proceed, who knows, we have already","20,086 followers",Ben Kolber,1K,324,21.6M,2016,https://www.quora.com/Will-robots-replace-unskilled-jobs-in-the-near-future
