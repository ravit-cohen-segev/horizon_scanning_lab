0,Language is more than just a means of communication. It is a glimpse into a culture and how they view the world. It can be influenced by many things that are unique to that culture and the people's way of life.Language is more than just a means of communication.

Although these mistakes were based solely around not knowing the gender of a table or chair, they insisted that I had to learn how words change with the case. This I am somewhat good at retaining and applying. I have even struggled with the jussive, but I am a homophobe’s worst nemisis, because I have an appalling concept of gender. My solution is practice.In my career I often worked with linguists. Linguists with honours degrees who worked with native speakers of their chosen language every day. When I found that linguists of any standing have a reputation of being technologically inept, it was like a light being switched on. I too had always found them to be notably incompetent.I am by nature a maths and science person. Not many people in fields of interest to me, speak languages. There is a divide.Yet I can be instantly understood, despite my British regional accent. Foreigners speak English and we know whether they are Italian, Dutch or French. The world of people wanting to communicate is full of peoples making the yes grammatical mistake, wit dee schtrong akzent un de tereebul spelling. These problems can be quickly ameliorated, given the opportunity to hear the sentences which people are likely to say.When I have attended courses, the gifted naturals who sound like and even emulate the body language of their target nationality, have nothing to say. Give them an hour with someone interesting and they won’t ask any of the questions we all want to know.Now I am very effective at communicating with technologists, from engineers to physiotherapists to doctors of anything, in their language. A linguist would need a course to understand their vernacular, but would speak like a native. I am independent, although on my journey to this workable level of competence, I was supported by “Numpty” who used to go in after I had tried my best and entertained and shown respect by trying, then say, “Whatever he said, this is what he wants”.Do both.",1 follower,Maryam Qureshi,781,0,0,2020,https://www.quora.com/Will-technology-replace-the-need-to-learn-languages-in-the-near-future

At some point, the Latin that they spoke in France was sufficiently different from the Latin that they spoke in Spain that it stopped making sense to call them the same language.All of the Indo-European languages, from Hindi to Greek to Norwegian, are just one language, in the sense that there was an unbroken progression from the same starting point to today throughout which each language remained relatively the same from one day to the next. But with enough time, the creep of linguistic alteration—like the growth of your hair—marched steadily forward while never appearing to move at all.I guarantee you that when a permanent Mars base is established and a dozen generations have been born and lived and died there, the language that they speak will be different from anything heard on Earth.Languages never stop evolving.",29 followers,Dave Bailey,7K,397,2.7M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Will-technology-replace-the-need-to-learn-languages-in-the-near-future

Your background2. Your interest (red team versus blue team: red team attacks and blue team defends and both are equally important)3. Market/job opportunityYou can be an inch deep and miles wide in security or you can be inch wide and miles deep. For example there are different skill set required based on at which layer(network, OS,application , data) you are providing security. For example1. Network security (IPS, proxy, web filtering, email filtering, firewall, APT detection, next gen firewall and so on )2. Endpoint security (mostly desktops,mobile and laptops)3. Application security (code review, white box testing, black box testing and all three requires different kind of skill sets)4. Server security (web server, application server, database servers)5. Data security ( encryption, DRM, tokenization, compliance , data classification and policies and so forth)6. Network forensics or endpoint forensics7. Incident response and security monitoring8 malware analysis and reversing9. Hardware hacking (p0wning IoT devices smart meters, phones or Barbie dolls for fun)10. Surveillance (man in the middle for cell phones, sessions , cookie stealing, and so on)These are some of the high level buckets you have to think about and what matches your background.But before you do that I would strongly advice following .1. Read the entire TCP/IP illustrated volume I and when you finish it, read it one more time. If you can't finish the whole book atleast read first 10 chapters. You can thank me later.2. Read basics of port scanning on3. Read up on cyber kill chain4. Download kali from5. Once you are familiar with Kali and tools, Start with CTF (capture the flag) and try and solve few challenges.Now you have basics to conquer any advanced stuff in network and data security. For application security specially for white box testing or security code review you should have some programming background.Application security , malware reversing and security monitoring are really hot. Depending on the vertical you choose data security and compliance can be really in demand for example financial , healthcare or retail.Last but not least, there are ton of books on the topics I mentioned above , and ton of material onNow after all this if you say on top of this I have CISSP or CISA then it holds some water but it won't automatically get you a job just because you are CISSP . By the way there is an inside joke within security community but may be will table that for some other time.Good luck and I promise, you will never ever be bored in security.Regards,Vijay""If you can see the invisible you can do the impossible""P.S : the question was changed after it was answered. The initial question was how can you get a job as a cyber security expert and now it was change this is unfair to people who have spent time answering your initial question. If you wanted to change the question you should have asked separately.","129,190 followers",Jessica Su,3.9K,1.5K,49.7M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Will-technology-replace-the-need-to-learn-languages-in-the-near-future

When I heard the doctor tell her “six months”, it felt likeI met my wife, Jess, twenty-one years ago when she was nineteen.Our parents owned side-by-side cabins in the northern part of New York and we both happened to be along for the week-long hunting trip our fathers planned that year.Jess' father was a skilled hunter and could hit a headshot from a mile away — same as my dad.Jess and I didn't hunt with them — we hung out by the lake.The moment I saw Jess I fell in love. We've been together ever since.But now, now that she has an expiration date, I just don't know what to do — I'm scared and lost.Monday morning at work I was telling my best friend and supervisor, Timmy, about my wife's condition. Timmy told me that I.T. or Intelligent Terrestrial just came out with their latest models.These models are different than those of yesteryear because they are 52% mechanical and 48% biological.Timmy said all you have to do is mail a sample of DNA to I.T. and upload a digital copy of your consciousness through an app. You can then purchase a custom made clone at an age of your choice. When the clone arrives it will turn on, study it's surroundings and await a consciousness download.“Oh my God Timmy, what's the catch?”“The price, Leon.”When I got home from work, Jess and I plugged in and uploaded a digital copy of our entire conscious catalog to I.T. and then mailed off DNA samples.Jess asked me what age I wanted her to be. It felt awkward to say “twenty”, but I did it — I was honest. I miss her smooth, youthful skin and I want her to be young and healthy — especially if I have to cash my entire 401K in to afford it.We told her parents that we were going to basically bring her back from the dead and her father threatened to shoot any abomination that we brought into this world.One month later, on a day that Jess was particularly ill, the doorbell rang.Jess and I dragged the box through the door and laid it on the living room floor. I gently cut along the lines and when I opened the flaps, there,she,was.The last time my heart fluttered like this was the day I met her.Jess helped me lift I.T. out of the box and sit I.T. up.I.T. was warm and soft. I.T. was mine. I paid for I.T. I own I.T.Machines like this don't have rights — even though they are part biological, the governments recognize them in the same way they would a lawnmower — so, as I said, I.T. is my possession.The science behind uploading a digital consciousness is so cutting edge, that the laws just haven't caught up yet.Jess turned I.T. on and I.T. looked right into my eyes. I was in love — with two women, but, it was the same woman. We hadn't uploaded Jess' consciousness yet, so, I.T. was running on basic programming, but I.T. was gorgeous.Jess asked me what I wanted to do, and for the first time in a very long time — I lied to her.I told her we should go shopping and buy I.T. some clothes.I.T. doesn't seem to have a personality yet.“Hello…. Smile…”Jess picked outfits for both of them and we went for a walk through the park together. It was amazing — I was so happy.We walked down a cozy little trail and found a tuck away to sit and talk.I.T. watched and studied every move Jess and I made. I.T. was learning and adapting.I.T. was becoming aware.At one point Jess and I got distracted and I.T. wandered off. When we found I.T., I.T. was gazing at the sky.I asked I.T. what it was doing. I.T. said, “Where do I come from?”“You come from Heaven. You are my angel.”That answer seemed to work for I.T. We all walked back to the car and headed home.When we got home, Jess immediately started coughing. She fell to the ground and I tried to help her, but I didn't know what to do.Jess passed away right then. It was finally over.I called her family and the police. It took an hour for them to remove the body. I had Jess 2.0 sitting in my back room waiting for them to leave.After the police left, I plugged I.T. into my laptop and downloaded Jess' consciousness.After the download was complete, we walked outside and I looked into her gigantic brown eyes. I asked her, “Is it you, Jess?”She smiled and said, “It is, silly — now kiss me.”Her head slammed back. I didn't know if she was glitching or what and then I heard a bang and saw a hole above her left eye.My beautiful Jessica died twice today. I was crushed.Over the next two decades, I fell into a deep, dark, alcohol-fueled depression. Although I had developed a serious alcohol problem, I was able to work and save every single penny I earned.After twenty years of saving, I decided I wanted both of them back — the twenty-year-old Jess and the forty-year-old Jess.I sent my entire life savings off to I.T. and in one month, my doorbell rang.I cut the box open and wept when I saw my angel(s).I turned them on.I also clothed them. The younger version of me may have left them in the nude, but at this age, I just want my companion(s) back.The ladies helped me back to my room to lay down. I was so tired from all the excitement.I've waited and worked an entire lifetime to be with the woman I love. And now, at long last — she is beside me.I died, on that very night as a happy man.One day later, the doorbell rang. It seems my beautiful Jessicas used my direct deposit life insurance benefit to make a purchase.They gently cut the box open.And turned me on.You ask where technology will be in 2050?We will be everywhere.LeonSpecial thanks:Cameron — Dear friend.

Data scientists don’t necessarily come up with new techniques to a much greater extent than engineers.Another point is that engineers are supposed to build things, while the end result of a data science project is often just a piece of analysis in the form of a report, so there’s that.Oh, and I almost forgot the most important reason. Data science sounds cool.",21 followers,William Chen,998,930,28.8M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Will-technology-replace-the-need-to-learn-languages-in-the-near-future
