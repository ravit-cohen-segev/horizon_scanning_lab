Just maybe, we'll be able to make our brains consciously operate at frequencies that lore around the world says are necessary to access what now is seen as supernatural abilities.That or we might be able to create a piece of technology that reads human thoughts, and can translate those thoughts into a kind of Matter-Energy manipulation.Where we can through those devices sense the energy in us and those things around us. And by extending our mind into it we can make objects move or/and change their shape/state.And maybe if and when that technology is made common use, people will then never understand how such things were ever viewed as supernatural or magical.Those in the future looking back at us will laugh at our own naive and gullible understanding of the world.",326 followers,Anubhav Jain,2.4K,4.4K,123.7M,2020,https://www.quora.com/If-any-sufficiently-advanced-technology-is-indistinguishable-from-magic-is-magic-a-technology

Magical effects do - and are practised by entertainers all over the world, also by some charlatans who claim to have real magical powers (psychic surgeons, mediums, a certain spoon-bending oil-divining showman, etc.) but cannot prove them unless they control all the conditions of the test.Some magical entertainers do use technology - stage illusionists for example, rely wholly upon carefully designed mechanical props.

Bringing back the Horse would make the shades of every Cavalry man smile from whatever paradise they now exist in. Heaven, Valhalla the Elysian fields, you name it, They would love it! All Horse Warriors go to their reward, you know.Now to practicalities. What will we use? Kevlar. Relatively light and incredibly effective. It's used on modern warships in place of the wrought iron, Harvey Steel or Krupp cemented Armor of the past. Vests of some sort could be fashioned for man and horse with pockets to carry Kevlar plates. This is how a flak jacket is designed. Like knights armor, it would be thicker i.e. more Kevlar plates in front than back. The Rider could be protected. The Horse is the problem.You could swaddle the front and sides of a horse in Kevlar plates just as the future draft horses the knights used were protected. But there are three insurmountable problems.Primus, the legs. Horses are big but have relatively thin legs. Even big steeds like Percherons, Shires and Clydesdales. The mounts of the knights of France, England and Scotland respectively. How do you armor the legs? You cant.Secundas, logistics. Horses, especially draft horses eat a lot of grain and hay. You grow it in , say Nebraska and have to get it to wherever the horses are. It's all the same, whether it's grain and hay or oil and gasoline. Logistics are a bear.Tertius, size. Once again horses are big. And because they are, they are targets. Trust me, every horse on a modern battlefield would draw a maelstrom of fire.So, regretfully. We can't do it. But it was fun to try. Let's hear it for the Horse. The Horse has made us what we are. Fascinating new discoveries in genetics and Archaeology have shown us that a primal people of the steppes first tamed the horse. In doing so they went from wandering Hunter gatherers to the Lords of the World. In fact, these first horseman created the first Empires, long ago in the mists of pre history and generations before the Sumerians first started to farm the fertile Crescent. Their partnership with horses enabled them to dominate. And not just in battle. These Horse Lords are the Ancestors of most Eurasian people.
