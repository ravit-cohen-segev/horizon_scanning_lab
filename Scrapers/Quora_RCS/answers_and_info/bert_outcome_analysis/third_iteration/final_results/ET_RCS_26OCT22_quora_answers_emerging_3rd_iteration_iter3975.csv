5,"Do you think cellphone updates that could possibly, slow down the battery life of old phones, are forcing people to upgrade their phones?Yes and no.Yes, it's possible that as new features are added to the operating system, older hardware may have a hard time keeping up.But… I think the bigger factors that “force” users to upgrade are three-fold.First, it's a fact that as batteries age and undergo charge/discharge cycles, their life decreases. It's also a fact that many batteries are designed for about 2 years of “typical” charge/discharge cycles. The problem with “typical” is that everyone isDo you think cellphone updates that could possibly, slow down the battery life of old phones, are forcing people to upgrade their phones?Yes and no.Yes, it's possible that as new features are added to the operating system, older hardware may have a hard time keeping up.But… I think the bigger factors that “force” users to upgrade are three-fold.First, it's a fact that as batteries age and undergo charge/discharge cycles, their life decreases. It's also a fact that many batteries are designed for about 2 years of “typical” charge/discharge cycles. The problem with “typical” is that everyone is different, so some users may “wear out” a battery more quickly or more slowly than others. But, on average, you can expect a battery to last about two years.Batteries can be replaced, though they may need to be done by professional service centers, or external battery packs or battery cases can be used to augment battery life, so “old” batteries don't necessarily force device upgrades by themselves.That said, I think the bigger factor that forces upgrades is that most phone operating system upgrades stop coming to phones when they get to be about two years old. Apple is sometimes a little more generous in this regard, but sooner or later your aging phone will stop receiving updates.At first, most users don't notice any ill effects, except for, perhaps, not having the “cool” latest, greatest features. But as time goes on, existing apps are updated and new apps come out expecting a newer OS that the “old” phone will never get. Eventually, you end up with a “crippled” device because none of the apps you want to use will run on it.For example, a friend of mine was intent on holding onto his iPhone 4 as long as possible. After that phone stopped receiving OS updates, apps stopped working one by one, over time. First, his favorite weather app would no longer run because it needed to be updated, but the update required a newer OS than he would ever get, so that weather app was down for the count. That pattern repeated over time and, eventually, his banking app quit. That was the straw that broke the camel's back, so to speak, and he finally upgraded to a new phone.Having managed mobile software development projects, I know that developing software that is backwards-compatible for a couple OS versions isn't too bad, but it's virtually impossible to develop software that is “infinitely” backwards compatible with all previous OS versions, so we won't even try. I directed the team to make the software compatible with the current version, plus the most recent two versions. If the current version was, say, iOS 9.x, our mobile app would run on iOS 9.x, 8.x, and 7.x, but 6 or earlier was “iffy.” While we didn't do anything intentional to limit older OSs, we didn't go out of our way to support them, either. If it ran on iOS 5 or 6, great. If it didn't run, oh well.I didn't pull that 2 version limit out of thin air. A little research showed that over 80% of phones at any given time are running OS versions in that range. It just doesn't make financial sense for developers to support a shrinking minority.The third factor that “encourages"" upgrades is, most carriers offer 12, 18, or 24 month upgrade financing. When you “buy” a new phone, you agree to pay for it over a specified number of months (usually with no interest) and then you can trade in that old phone, get the newest phone, and just keep that same payment arrangement.Yes, I know that Apple infamously limited performance on devices with older batteries to help those users get a little more life out of their phones. I also know that affected users were incensed over it.But my honest opinion was that the whole fuss was much ado about nothing. Between battery life, software compatibility, and carrier financing plans, a vast majority of people upgrade within 2 years anyway. That's just the way it is, the vocal minority notwithstanding.","41,218 followers",Dave Haynie,708,6.9K,95.8M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-will-humanity-do-when-they-reached-the-peak-of-science-and-technology
6,"I think you are overly optimistic about the impact of life extension technology.If humanity llearns to extend human life by another 20 years at a cost that is widely affordable, that will obviously have a significant impact on population. This is not accounted for in the models (which predict increasing human longevity, but very slight increases in the most developed nations that are already close to the maximum achievable without a breakthrough).But I’ll be quite surprised if the projections are off for this reason.

(And if you dig into the projections, there is actually good reason to believe that they are too high because they perform their analysis at the level of countries and thus miss significant trends that are evident if you segregate population within countries by education level or economic level (either one will do, you don’t need both).

7,"I don’t believe that it will have the impact that many people imagine so my gut instincts tell me that when you look at the reality of the situation overall it not what you think, this is because the population is not increasing everywhere and in fact falling in many countries.

It’s highly possible that curing aging may exacerbate overpopulation issues in some countries in Africa and Asia but even there the birthrate is falling although currently it’s still far too high, regardless this will not be an issue for around 30 years after aging has become a treatable condition and must also be viewed together with technological progress that will increase the world’s carrying capacity. The other factor is that it's already becoming very apparent that in developed countries the tendency to have smaller families and less children is a consistent trend and has been for many years, and as I said above the birth rate is even dropping in many Third World and developing countries so I don't see that bringing aging under a decisive level of medical control would inevitably lead to the population catastrophe used as a justification for not tackling aging by many people.My personal belief is that when people know that they are going to live for a very long time it is highly probable they will take the decision either not to have children at all or to delay having children until late in life which is already possible due to recent developments to delay the menopause and extend fertility, medical progress in the future will have an even more important impact in this area.There are several additional factors which must be kept in mind when it comes to the population which I have outlined below; they are something we should all take on board.1. People not dying does not add to the population growth rate. Only people having children adds to the population.2. The younger people have children, the faster their population grows.3. The longer people live, the later they start having children.4. The later people start having children, the fewer children they tend to have.5. Declining fertility rates, when combined with anti aging medicine, will inevitably create a society with more older people and less younger people.The points above clarify why around the world, the countries with the longest lived populations have slow growth rates - leaving out immigration which is not new people, just people moving from A to B. And the countries with the fastest population growth rates all have short life spans.I should also explain one further factor which is likely the single most important consideration which is that any average number of children per couple that is less than 2 is no longer exponential growth, as asymptotic growth to an eventual maximum. Simplest case example, if the average per couple was 1 child, the population could never double regardless of all the other factors, even if no one ever died. If the birth rate was 1.8 children per couple over time the population would still decline although more slowly.","74,722 followers",Tiny Nair,2.7K,689,28M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-will-humanity-do-when-they-reached-the-peak-of-science-and-technology
8,"Lots of people on Quora ask what I think is likely to happen decades from now. Well, I wrote a Paper in 1974 predicting that the birth-rate of the developed countries would drop dramatically and life-expectancy would fall to 66 by 2027. At all stages of this predicted Life Table, I was right, even down to the prediction that Life expectancy for males and females would equalize at the male level in 2018.I never made predictions going beyond my own lifetime but if I had to now, I would say the world’s population in 2100 will be half what it is today.
