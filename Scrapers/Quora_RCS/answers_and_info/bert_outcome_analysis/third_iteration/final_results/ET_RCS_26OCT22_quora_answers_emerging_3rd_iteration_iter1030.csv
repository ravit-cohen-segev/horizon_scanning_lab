8,"Transfer learning in ML models.Humans are really good at generalizing. We only have to see a few dogs before we can recognize a dog when we see one.Machines are not.

If we could teach machines to do the same, they would learn exponentially faster and apply that learning more effectively.Transfer learning is a very hot topic in AI research right now, so I expect major breakthroughs in the next few years. I think this may be sufficient to achieve artificial general intelligence, but even if not, it will dramatically extend the range of tasks that machines can accomplish.","45,628 followers",David Seidman,790,3.6K,85.1M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Whats-the-best-technology-or-programming-language-to-learn-now-for-the-next-10-or-20-years-to-take-advantage-of-things-like-wearable-technology-the-internet-of-things-and-drones

Mars is being mapped by satellites in the kind of detail that would enable use of GPS if someone hypothetically had a car there right now.Even with terraforming, if permanent settlement is achieved by humanity there will inevitably be changes to physiology over generations. Subtle differences in gravity, the composition of all aspects of the environment (soil, atmosphere, oceans, lakes etc) will cause us to adapt. That is not likely to happen in 100 years, but if we can survive on another world physical changes are inevitable.Regarding the most likely changes, I would say the following would be the first to emerge:There are so many possibilities. An interesting way to think of this problem is to look up the genetic disorders that are known to medicine. In a different environment, these could become advantageous, especially if they are merely a difference in the way a gene acts (as opposed to missing/extra genes) and recessive. The gene for blue eyes is recessive, as a well known example.","15,776 followers",Daniel Super,662,11.1K,29M,2016,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-next-big-things-in-technology-for-2015-2020
