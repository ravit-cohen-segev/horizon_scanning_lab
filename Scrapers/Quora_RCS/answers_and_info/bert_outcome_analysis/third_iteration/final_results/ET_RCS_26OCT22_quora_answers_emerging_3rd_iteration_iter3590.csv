They walk at night - cooler. Imagine 200 people making that call. If you had a barrier - not happen.

4,If there were visitors maybe. But seeing there’s none atm sure hope asteroid is still faaaaaaaar away.Also seeing trip to other planet would be multi generational basically one way trip I would be more worried about the visitors.

5,"A few WW2 German subs were quite advanced.

7,"The german Type XXI Submarines. They were the first “real” submarines, designed to stay for long periods aka most of the time of their patrols under water .Until then submarines were more or less torpedo boats with diving capability. Well…. all torpedoboats have this capability, but submarines could also surface again ;)They were fast under water, quiet and had a great endurance, they could travel submerged with 5 knots for 75 hours and then had to recharge the batteries. Which could be done using the snorkel within 5 hours.",175 followers,Charles Florendo,6K,230,806.2K,2021,https://www.quora.com/Why-does-the-US-government-want-to-build-a-border-wall-while-there-are-much-more-advanced-technologies-available-to-protect-the-border

10,Accenture has Technical and operations so ATCI is technical domain. Level 8 is project lead you'll be having 70% technical involvement with client and 30% project activities within Accenture.

( Have you ever heard of decreasing Salary while you get more experienced? This happens in TCS due to its shitty appraisal system).There are many more factors in which Accenture is way better than TCS.( So, my suggestion to you is that if you you had an offer letter from Accenture and TCS, undoubtedly go for Accenture unless you want to ruin yourself in TCS ( Yes, I am very much sure about that).",2 followers,Tripti Shrivastava,586,0,0,2016,https://www.quora.com/Why-does-the-US-government-want-to-build-a-border-wall-while-there-are-much-more-advanced-technologies-available-to-protect-the-border

The hieroglyphics and cuneiform writing is often so small even adults can barely see it, let alone read it. Maybe there were a few giants but they could not have performed the majority of the work. The standard hypothesis is that the Giants were just larger humans with more Homo Erectus DNA admixture. There are beyond tall individuals in every culture and ethnicity, evenly distributed worldwide. Large Native America bodies have been discovered all over North America. The fact is that people with glandular related tallness have limited strength and are often quite weak. Even with giants though moving around multi ton blocks is not just some easy task. It is well known that elephants and the last mammoths were utilized to move the large blocks through the sand. What is less well known is that the Hebrew workers were paid in Beer for their labors, 2 Gallons per day. If the workers were all drunk all the time it goes to figure the stories revolving about this period seem to make no sense at all. In fact no single story from history seems to match the reality of the pyramids. Herodotus, Strabo, Lucian, The Torah, New Testament, the Koran: none of these have a single accurate description. The most detailed accounts of the actual construction process come not from Egypt but from China, where they also have large Pyramids. Essentially we know with absolute certainty that this means the original builders of the Pyramids left. The Pyramids must have been abandoned for over a thousand years before the new people arrived and picked up new tools to deface the statues and claim the buildings. The people who live in Egypt today are not directly connected to those who dwelt in Egypt before 500 BC, and those people were unrelated to the group who built the Pyramids before 3000 BC. The fact is that the people who claim to have built the Pyramids did not include accurate descriptions or measurements anywhere in any documentation. It is also been noted that the hieroglyphics are only present in a single pyramid, the Red Pyramid of Djoser, in Saqquara. This implies that the heiroglyphics were invented by the newcomers and not at all connected to the original builders. So everything we know about the timeline is based on lies crafted by illiterate vandals and uneducated thieves to cover up for their crimes.","14,895 followers",Krister Sundelin,1.6K,23.8K,89.8M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Why-does-the-US-government-want-to-build-a-border-wall-while-there-are-much-more-advanced-technologies-available-to-protect-the-border
16,"The problem with giants is that they are almost always ‘scaled up’ humans. 3 times taller, 3 times wider and 3 times thicker. And that just don’t work. Because then their volume and weight become 3 * 3 * 3 = 27 times greater, While their legs only become 3 * 3 = 9 times stronger. look at an elephant:OK. the human standing in front of it is a 4 year old kid. but note that the legs are big enough around that the kid could hide inside them (if they were hollow).The problem with giants is that they are almost always ‘scaled up’ humans. 3 times taller, 3 times wider and 3 times thicker.
