0,"Cell towers can communicate with devices tens of kilometres away. However, this doesn't work in densely populated areas: when a huge number of devices all share the same frequency spectrum in the same area, they end up talking all over each other and no one gets a usable amount af bandwidth. Also, the high frequency radio waves required for high speeds aren't so good at penetrating buildings and terrain. The solution is to have many little cells (radiuses of tens to hundreds of meters) instead of a few big ones.Transmitters for the smallest cells oviusly aren't put on cell towers, because whenCell towers can communicate with devices tens of kilometres away.

This would be a feasible alternative to cell towers; except if you'd like the entire world to make the switch over night; we just don't have the resources to replace that humongous tangle of infrastructure very quickly. The change would do wonders to the battery life and connection speeds of your mobile devices, but horrors to your phone bill.On the other hand, if by ""current technology"" you mean stuff that already works in labs and can be installed over the next decade, there are some interesting possibilities: Fiberoptic networks that terminate in gigabit wireless transceivers all over the place. Mesh networking (i.e. routing connections from one wireless device to the next). Solar-powered high-altitude drones, which can cover sparesly populated areas. Combine these, and you could theoretically do away with cell towers. Of course, a scheme that doesn't include any towers whatsoever would be more silly than realistic.",10 followers,Andrew Forrest,8.2K,6.2K,16.8M,2016,https://www.quora.com/What-current-technology-can-replace-cell-towers
1,"Its the technology you’re using to read this; your screen.Think about it. When you booked your tickets for Avengers: Endgame online (I’m assuming you fall into the vast majority who did watch it), did you actually select the option to pick them up at the box office? Of course not! ( Another assumption here, but a safe one to make) Why would you want to waste time standing in line to collect your tickets. You could just walk up to the theater entrance, hold up your phone for them to scan the QR code on the M-ticket and let you in.What about the last time you took a flight? Did you bother to takIts the technology you’re using to read this; your screen.Think about it.

Did you bother to take a printout of your ticket? Or did you go the E-ticket route again?Its not just about being environment-conscious. Its also about convenience. Imagine you are going on a trip and you have taken printouts of your tickets and itinerary. You leave your home in a rush. You get to the airport and you realize you’ve forgotten a certain document. What do you do now? Whereas if you have downloaded all your documents in digital form, you can access them with a few swipes of your finger right from your phone.Screens are replacing paper more and more everyday.","16,463 followers",Chris Everett,1.9K,11K,79M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-current-technology-can-replace-cell-towers

Performance has increased dramatically in the last 4 years to the point where smart phones rival many laptops.Apple sees itself as stewards of the best computing technology on the planet. The question is whether Apple (and others) can apply this technology to solve problems that matter to many millions of people. From my perspective, there are still areas where this could happen. Perhaps the most likely is health monitoring and medical care.Another area I find interesting is smart home and Internet of Things integration.Enjoy!",0 followers,Tim Ventura,765,1.1K,11.5M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-current-technology-can-replace-cell-towers
3,"Short answer:  Not any time soon.I'll talk specifically about single atomic layer graphene films, e.g. those made by chemical vapor deposition (CVD), and ignore the nanoplatelet/powder/reduced graphene oxide form of material. Maybe someone can A2A someone at XG Sciences, Vorbeck, or Applied Graphene Materials to provide a perspective on that side of the graphene community. An interesting side note is that most CVD graphene is formed on a copper substrate as in the picture below:Copper is used primarily for electrical/electronic and construction applications.

A perfect sheet of graphene is the most conductive material that's ever been tested (see WikipediaHaving said all of that, we may see a few niche applications in electronics where graphene’s unique combination of properties make it a better alternative to copper. Areas where graphene might ‘win’:In summary:  If you’re worried about graphene technology hammering your large portfolio of copper futures, I wouldn't lose any sleep over it.",0 followers,Ashok Bishnoi,12.8K,314,7.7M,2015,https://www.quora.com/What-current-technology-can-replace-cell-towers
