I think personally leadership is about timeless principles. I think it is about the nature of the individual and who they are, where they are going and what they are about. Creating follower-ship and I can give you all sorts of lectures on the nature of leadership and what that really means. I get a little bit sensitive when people talk about leadership styles, what that really means is how your personality comes across while you engage with the process of leading. The bottom line is, leaders lead. In order to be a leader, you have to have followers. Leadership implies, follower ship. When you have people following you because they like where yo are going and you have communicated that some what clearly. You are therefore by definition a leader. What personal style you have as you engage in that practice and those disciplines is a function of other things, other than maybe just leadership. Now short hand we call that leadership styles, I get that but, I did want to set that as a preface relative to this conversation. Having said that, I don't think leadership styles have changed significantly over the period of time of the technological boom. What I think has happened is the ability to project your style, your leadership mantra and the results that you create by virtue of that and a whole raft of other things can be more easily communicated to the marketplace. We are now looking for the Jeff Bezos’s or the Elon Musks of the world, WE worship them in terms of their leadership capabilities and what they have produced and i’m sure a whole raft of others that I am doing a disservice to by not mentioning. Nothing has changed, there used to be that same level of leadership and dare I say, style in the old days. You could map an Elon Musk to all sorts of old time, old school business leaders. The difference is, there wasn't the outlets for the general populace being aware of it. Those that worked at, Old Co., Henry Ford if you will, Ford motor company back in the day. They knew how good he was, They knew his style but, the general population didn’t because there wasn't the mechanism to distribute the results produced or to catalog and demonstrated and promote the nature of the individual. The ability of social media and the digital environment and all the channels that we have now, to message more effectively to a wider audience without huge cost and expense enables us to have greater visibility on leaders today. The rock stars of the day are the technological leaders because those are the rock star enterprises that have the high growth and so therefore are the “great leaders.” Boring companies also have great leaders. I can think, and I won't reference them right here. I can think of two companies in particular, both of which are very boring on what they are doing and how they do it. I will tell you what, the employees of those businesses will walk on hot coals for the leaders of those businesses. Because they are great leaders with, to coin the phrase or borrow the phrase, great leadership style that aligns with the people that are there. It also doesn't align with the people that aren't there or the people that used to be there. Not every style matches every individual. Some people don't like working for, XYZ style. Because it doesn’t suit their style, That's okay. Doesn't mean the leadership style is good or bad. What it means is, that there wasn't a good match there. I don’t think leadership styles have evolved. I think it is more obvious to track them and monitor them. For them to be promoted and have the results be demonstrated than it was in the past. I think the underlying principles of leadership are constant. That’s another lecture for another day but, to answer the question, I don't think leadership styles have evolved at all or certainly significantly since the technological boom.","358,962 followers",Sean Kernan,891,5.6K,726.9M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Who-were-the-members-of-the-initial-sales-team-at-Palantir-Technologies-How-did-their-sales-team-grow-What-critical-hires-were-needed-as-the-business-evolved
2,"Yes we have. We can stop arguing about “trans-humanisn” now, because we have stopped being what we traditionally call “naturally human” thousands of years ago.

If you are hungry, do you hunt for food like the tigers and wolves, graze like the sheep and goats, or do you head to a nearby shop to buy it? Since thousands of years ago, we stopped developing better stomachs to digest tough vegetative material or tough sinews. Instead, we have been developing tools such as fire, selective breeding, and recently, genetic engineering to greatly increase the nutritional value of our food while making it far easier to digest.The truth of the matter is that we are capable of and are continuing to developing new technologies that greatly improve our ability to survive in the world. In a darwinian sense, natural selection acts not just on our bodies, but on an integrated entity of us + the tools we develop to improve our selectivity. From an evolutionary perspective, we are part human, part technology.","220,613 followers",Franklin Veaux,1.8K,47.3K,782.9M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Who-were-the-members-of-the-initial-sales-team-at-Palantir-Technologies-How-did-their-sales-team-grow-What-critical-hires-were-needed-as-the-business-evolved
3,"Not evolved. Most humans have developed to be dependent on our technology. For instance, today the temperature is in the 30s. I coulf not survive without the technology of clothing, blankets, house, fire, etc. I do not get my own food from nature, but am dependent on all the technology of farming, animal husbandry, food processing, transportation, etc so that I do not starve to death.Does that dependence make me “part technology”? I do have quite a bit of dental work, so I have technology in my body.

7,"So where did your delusion that human evolution stopped when humans started using tools and technology come from? The paleontological evidence shows early stone tools in layers associated with early hominids, a quick Google search will give you loads of detail on this.
