To see what kind of banking they provided I opened a business account with this “online bank” settled some outstanding invoices from banks and left the balance standing.At the time I opened the account compnay documentation, passport etc was given and no questions were asked. As a dual citizen living (sadly) mostly out of suitcases around the world I have only a Swiss National Insurance number - this was the first hurdle with the compliance of the “T” bank - they could not understand that an AHV Nummer was and represented.So some months ago I thought to use the prepaid debit card and attempted to pay an invoice in a bar abroad. Declined - hmm strange the account was covered by a few thousand Pounds Sterling ( they can not provide multi currency accounts too complicated ) So I used their Chat - answer the account is frozen we do not know why - then next the account was frozen 1 year ago we have no British National Insurance number (NI) from you - then next was the account is not frozen you entered the pin incorrectly - then the software you are using is old and you need to upgrade ?The excuses have been spinning on for now 7 weeks no solution no nothing - that is internet banking of an internet bank.Banking is not a “Geek World” but it is built on centuries of expierence and knowledge NOT on Javascript or C++ and other exotic computer languages.Further these “internet banks” may have a legal head office in Europe but their staff sit in India, south Africa, and elsewhere answering chat requests thus the client is not protected by European Laws and Regulations. So Data Protection Laws say of Britain are nil and void as the ansering party is sitting in India and on a salary of “?”. Your data is sold in seconds and at the moment is floating in the dark web.On thee other side I have a private investment account with an established bank in Geneva since 1989 at the time the bench mark for opening accounts at that bespoken bank were lower.If I have a problem I can call the bank in Geneva, speak to a bank officer who has a ) knowledge of banking b) can resolve the matter either on the telephone there and then or in 24 hours c) is under regulations and laws which protect him/her and me.Fashions come and go but old fashion banking has been here since the Templar Knights (invention of the Letter of Credit ) and the first banking families in North Italy.Internet banks are a fashion hyper with very high risks for the customer base as the regulation bodies can not regulate such banks.","11,699 followers",Jared Crypto Friend,1.1K,1.9K,15.4M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Will-the-traditional-banking-system-physical-banks-be-able-to-withstand-the-emergence-of-financial-technologies-Why

Brin and Page are young, smart and ambitious, and they’re the founders, which doesn’t apply to the leadership of Apple and Microsoft. I explain the importance of thisIn Google’s early days, they set out to dominate search without knowing how they’d make money. AdWords wasn’t as obvious then as it is now. But Brin and Page knew all along that if they could dominate search they’d monetise somehow.And that has been how they’ve approached everything they’ve gone into. They don’t care about the money as the money will eventually come when they dominate.Chromebook, Android, Google Docs, YouTube, Gmail, their leadership in self-driving cars are all seeds that Google have planted, that will make them huge returns at some point. They’re patient.I mean, despite going in well after Apple into the smartphone arena, they now run 82% of the world’s smartphones. An absolutely incredible achievement. They knew this was a space they had to dominate at whatever short-term cost. And just imagine how much money they’ll make from this in the coming decades.The fact that Google trades at a broadly similar PE to Microsoft just shows how short-sighted Wall Street can be…",18 followers,Asim Qureshi,8.7K,996,156.1M,2017,https://www.quora.com/At-what-stage-in-the-growth-of-your-business-should-you-setup-a-department-for-general-research-potential-hires-emerging-technologies-pending-legislation-ect

We meant it in the same way Google owns ""search"", Coke owns ""cola"", and Tesla owns ""electric cars"".It means that when people think of that word they think of that brand first. That's powerful because people's decisions to try or buy your product takes place in their mind and in a world of multitudes of choices if you come first to mind you have a big advantage.Owning a word means building a great product but also focusing the marketing around a simple clear message.Everything we’ve done has focused around that one word, or message, payroll. Sure, we’re an HR product too, but we felt the pain point for our customers was payroll and so we focused our product and marketing towards payroll.Now, if you type ""payroll"" in Google Malaysia incognito, we're right at the top, even before “Malaysia” or “software”. Sure, we don't own ""payroll"" in Malaysia yet - no way near - but we're on our way.The takeaway? Make sure your brand stands for something simple, as consumers, in a world of millions of brands, won't have time to decipher your confusing messages - and so when a small business markets it needs to make sure it’s focused, clear, and consistent.Ultimately, if your brand doesn't stand for something simple and clear, it'll stand for nothing.",18 followers,Asim Qureshi,738,996,156.1M,2019,https://www.quora.com/At-what-stage-in-the-growth-of-your-business-should-you-setup-a-department-for-general-research-potential-hires-emerging-technologies-pending-legislation-ect

Do you know someone whose final weeks on Earth were spent racking up expensive medical bills for their loved ones to deal with after their death?When you really think about it, this idea is genius.

Two other small ventures had failed before this one. Failure was not an optionMissing a delivery was a huge customer service problem,I wanted to fire him right there, but contained my emotions trying to be smarter.Don Lupe was my first employee. He was an expert tailor. I relied blindly on his skills because I had zero clothing alterations experience. To date I have no idea how to even change the thread.I knew he was abusing my ignorance, but I had no way to prove it! How long should each job take? I had no idea!To complicate things a little further, I assigned Don Lupe a managerial position to help me supervise the rest of the employees while I was in school.I eventually understood that this old man wanted me to fail and he was negatively influencing the rest of the team with his cynical attitude.With a growing number of unsatisfied customers and limited production, this was taking a toll on my sales.I was in trouble!“What can I do? Oh! I have an idea!”So I did…I started timing the jobs, tracking each of my employees skills.It didn't work.They were all colluded against me and afraid of the old man.More frustrations! More anger!I was 20 years old, with no management experience.It was a tough start!To answer your question:I will never forget how my revenues BOOSTED from one month to another by changing the payroll formula!I TRIPLED my sales from one month to the other!Over the years we’ve perfected the compensation formula.Every employee has a variable bonus that is directly associated with their performance.Today, this business is still running +25 years later.

Bob would nowIf you can’t explain it simply, you don’t understand it well enough.I would try to explain Blockchain in the most simple way I can.Let us assume that there are two people Alice and Bob. Alice borrows some money from Bob and Bob writes it on a piece of paper signed by Alice. After some days Alice denies the existence of such document and claims that Bob has forged that piece of paper. Bob would now find it difficult to prove that Alice actually owes him Money.In this example Alice and Bob are two nodes.Now assume the same scenario, but among a society. So there are ’k’ pair of people transacting with each other. And the only proof that each pair has, is that piece of paper. Looking at this scenario, one person, Kate comes up with a solution. She suggests maintaining a common notebook of transaction for entire society. She designates town hall to be the place where every exchange takes place. In the common notebook, every pair writes the transaction and then the notebook is kept safely. People rejoice and accept Kate as their leader.That notebook can be called a database.But one day, somebody spills wine on the notebook. This makes the notebook illegible. Taking the advantage of this situation, Alice again denies taking money from Bob.This is the problem databases face - single point of failure.Irritated by this problem, Kate comes up with another solution. She suggests maintaining multiple notebooks. She chooses some trustworthy people from the society and gives them a notebook each. Now every time a transaction or exchange takes place between two people, Kate instructs some of those trustworthy people to mention the transaction in their notebooks. So the data is repeated in the notebooks. Now, even if one notebook is destroyed, chances are that all the data regarding transactions are still present in the combination of other notebooks.This is a distributed database and multiple notebooks are the multiple nodes.But next day, another problem arises. Kate has a friend named Bert who owes a lot of money to some people in the society. He asks Kate for help and she agrees to help him. She instructs all the people with the notebooks to remove the entries where Bert received money. Now Bert doesn’t owe any money based on the notebooks.This is the problem with distributed databases - they are centralized. That means one single entity owns all the nodes/resources and can make changes as they deem fit.When the people from the society come to know of it, they remove Kate from the leadership.* They decide to keep a notebook each. Every time a transaction is made between any two people , all the people from the town come together and mention it in their respective notebooks. So if there are n people in the society, then there are n notebooks and no one person controls the overall representation of the transactions. This is decentralization.","31,157 followers",Phillip Remaker,1.7K,11K,78.8M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Will-the-traditional-banking-system-physical-banks-be-able-to-withstand-the-emergence-of-financial-technologies-Why
