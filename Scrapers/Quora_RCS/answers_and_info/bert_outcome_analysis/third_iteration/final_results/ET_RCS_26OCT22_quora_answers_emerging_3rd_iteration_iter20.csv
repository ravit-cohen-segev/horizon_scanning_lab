Why did they bother?I began to realize that the web offered a new venue for a natural human spirit of generosity, of sharing. People love to help others. It is a very deep instinct, and probably more responsible for our civilization than is generally recognized.  We gain pleasure when we do it.Wikipedia is also such a miracle. It is amazing how good a job it does. I grew up with the Encyclopedia Brittanica, and Wikipedia goes so far beyond it that it is amazing.  Many people contribute to improving the Wikipedia web sites, just out of the pleasure they get in doing a good thing, in helping to create something so well-done. Jimmy Wales should be given a Nobel Peace Prize.Quora, in my mind, is the latest discovery of a method to extend this instinct to help others. I am addicted. If I have the right answer to a question, I really enjoy sharing it. Unlike email, Quora shares the questions and answers with thousands of other people.
