0,"It‚Äôs the old ‚Äúthe grass is greener on the other side,‚Äù phenomenon.Don‚Äôt let the fact that he is engaged fool you, either. Even if he does not plan to actually cheat on his fianc√©, he might easily become emotionally attached to you.Switch places with his fianc√© in your mind and ask yourself how you would feel about your intended spending so much time with a female coworker?At the very least, it looks bad to your other work associates.Time to start dropping hints, and go from there.",0 followers,Marsha Klein,2.8K,126,613.2K,2019,https://www.quora.com/Why-is-a-co-worker-who-is-engaged-trying-to-spend-much-time-with-me-He-never-goes-for-breaks-with-anyone-else-but-only-me-I-have-newly-joined-this-organization-and-we-work-in-the-same-technology
1,"It sounds like he really likes you but don‚Äôt encourage him into any other relationship while he is engaged. If he comes on to you, be shocked and turn away. That will show him what kind of a woman you are. It should also show you the kind of man he is.If he does that with you while he‚Äôs engaged to another. Chances are he‚Äôll do the same to you, should you become involved with him.","1,212 followers",Jennifer Finger,3.9K,7.4K,4.5M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Why-is-a-co-worker-who-is-engaged-trying-to-spend-much-time-with-me-He-never-goes-for-breaks-with-anyone-else-but-only-me-I-have-newly-joined-this-organization-and-we-work-in-the-same-technology

3,"I would try sketchup.

4,"I had a teacher in 4th grade that had an unconventional method of doing homework corrections.She refused to mark crosses on any mistakes. Instead, she would mark a little red dot next to the error rather than mark big fat Xs all over the page.The idea was to shift the focus of Xs ‚Äúnaming and shaming‚Äù mistakes to a more constructive approach that showed areas of improvement in a less threatening and more encouraging way.Looking back, it was a great gesture since a page full of red crosses was always disheartening and demotivating as a kid.I had a teacher in 4th grade that had an unconventional method of doing homework corrections.She refused to mark crosses on any mistakes.

5,"The main platform I use is Zoom. Many teachers in my district use this one. The other would be Google Classroom.Our schedule is district wide for elementary school.

I try to replicate the physical classroom experience as much as possible.I open the meeting at 8:15. Students need to show up hopefully by 8:30, some will be a few minutes late. Roll is taken during the first half hour. I greet the student as they enter, just like I would do the the physical classroom. If they‚Äôre there early, they can talk to each other and to me. They have morning work, a journal activity. This would be on Seesaw. I can share my screen while we go over the assignment. They‚Äôre are learning the basics of a simple paragraph, so we review the term, like topic sentence, body, conclusion, transition words. The assignment has sentence frames right now to help guide them. This is what they would have in the classroom.During the teaching blocks, I teach like I would in the classroom, I use my whiteboard, we read together, students take turns reading, we go over math lesson together and share work and students can raise their hands, like they would in the classroom. For P.E., we take breaks during the teaching sessions and use the program GoNoodle or sometimes we just do the various stretches that we would if we at school.I keep Zoom on the whole school day, so students can interact with each other during break and lunch, if they (or their parent) lets them. At the end of the day, we have reminders about thing coming up, just like we would do in the classroom and we say goodbye.So, for this age group, the best thing I‚Äôve found is to replicate the regular classroom experience, as much as possible.","284,850 followers",James Altucher,30.8K,878,91.7M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Why-is-a-co-worker-who-is-engaged-trying-to-spend-much-time-with-me-He-never-goes-for-breaks-with-anyone-else-but-only-me-I-have-newly-joined-this-organization-and-we-work-in-the-same-technology

10,"I think that many parents allow their children to use technology at very young ages. It should be limited and supervised. It can be EXTREMELY addictive, so parents should proceed with caution. I would hesitate to buy them their own tablets, computers or gaming systems until they are at least 10 or 12 years old. Even then, the amount of time they get to be on should be limited. It has been determined that allowing young children to use electronics excessively actually affects their brain. Brain scans have shown that they are comparable to those of drug addicts.
