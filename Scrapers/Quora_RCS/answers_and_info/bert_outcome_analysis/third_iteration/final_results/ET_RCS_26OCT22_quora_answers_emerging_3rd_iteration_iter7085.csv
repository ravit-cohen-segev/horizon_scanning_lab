I've read recent articles that point out that the very size of our brains, which is really what makes us what we are, are only possible due to having cooked meat available due to their high energy consumption.Cooked meat (and cooked vegetables most likely) makes much more of the nutrition value of the food readily available since it is effectively pre-digesting the food and breaking down bonds our body would otherwise have to expend energy doing itself.Effectively that allowed humankind to evolve into its current state of culture and sapience, so you can't realCollin's answer has a key point.

We are definitely allowing to breed those that 'nature' would haveMost interesting to me is that high achievers in contemporary human culture are likely to have the smallest number of offspring. That inversion of natural selection is more concerning to me than the allowance of previously unfit breeders to propagate.",366 followers,Brett Alder,1.1K,0,0,2011,https://www.quora.com/What-will-be-the-effect-of-technology-on-human-evolution

2,"No. Evolution will never stop.What people fail to understand is thatAccording to Meredith Small (1), professor at Cornell, ""evolution is defined as change in gene frequencies over time, which means that over generations, there will be changes in the gene pool, and humans experience those changes as much as any other organism"".Therefore, evolution is not a path that takes humans to perfection - fitness, resistance to illness, and so on.

But a process of constant change driven by the environment.Therefore, evolution has not stopped, and will never stop, but will change us because of the influence of our current environment. For instance, as populations become more developed (in the sense of richer, and more educated), they tend to reproduce less. At the same time, developed nations are a minority in sheer number. As a consequence, in the future, humans will have much more genetic influence from current ""poor"" populations (Latin America, Africa, some parts of Asia) than from developed populations (North America, Europe, Japan). This is evolution. Not necessarily for the better.(1) Scientific American article, October 1999..","105,675 followers",Dave Consiglio,544,6.8K,91.6M,2012,https://www.quora.com/What-will-be-the-effect-of-technology-on-human-evolution

New inventions are happening, and new paradigms are born almost every day. Conventional concepts we are used to as a human race for decades or even centuries are being disrupted by cutting edge technology.Just half a century ago, computers were only surfacing and were used for particular scientific or research work, but today they are found all around us. We see, and experience computing power around us in all shapes, sizes, and types. There are small and portable ones like in smartphones. There are big ones like desktops and mainframes. And lately, with innovative devices like Google Glass or Snap Spectacles — this computing power has also invaded our wearable devices.Whether we like this technological revolution or not — we can clearly see how it is affecting our daily lives. But an interesting question arises — what are long-term effects of this revolution? I am not talking a decade or a century from now — instead what are the implications on a human evolutionary timeline — which could span millennia.Technology is changing the patterns of our life. There was a time when we were very physically active, but now we rely on devices to do most of our work. The changes in our behavioral patterns and adaptations that are caused by these technological advances could prove to be the primary driving forces behind the next stage of evolution for our species.Charles Darwinproposed that evolution is the change in the characteristics of a species over several generations — which could happen over eons or within few centuries. This process of evolution relies on the process of natural selection.••••••••••••••• .Instead, the evolution is occurring in two other ways•••••••••• .In the end, we can say that human evolutionary cycles will definitely be affected by this rapid growth in technological advancements.","75,801 followers",Adriana Heguy,519,2.2K,35.1M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-will-be-the-effect-of-technology-on-human-evolution

Some of them are good but some are shaping us in directions that are increasingly harmful to us and to our society. We are coevolving with our technologies, as we did for hundreds of thousands to even millions of years, ever since we acquired fire, which shaped our digestive system because it provided us with an easier way of extracting nutrients from our food and that in turn provided us with excess energy to feed our growing brain. Or ever since the stone age, which shaped the evolution of the dexterity of our hands for creating and using stone tools or shoulders for throwing weapons made with stone tools when we were hunting.The question was: Has technology already affected human evolution?","74,723 followers",Tiny Nair,776,689,28M,2001,https://www.quora.com/What-will-be-the-effect-of-technology-on-human-evolution

Many telecommunications types have blurred lines as communications can cross between one type of network to another to reach their final destination. Mobile phones for example must be bridged with POTS to make a call to a ‘landline,’ or regular POTS phone. Fibre optic networks carry digitized communications over long distances, or are used where speed and noise resistance is required. Light is pulsed down the cable, and the light is basically modulated to carry the intelligence or data.","1,594 followers",Michael Van In,631,1.5K,2.9M,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-will-be-the-effect-of-technology-on-human-evolution

Access to the ALPR data base requires a criminal predicate and the requestor must have completed training in the use of the devices and information stored in the data base.
