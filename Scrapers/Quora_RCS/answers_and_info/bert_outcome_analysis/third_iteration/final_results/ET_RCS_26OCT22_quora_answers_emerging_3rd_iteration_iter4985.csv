That sense of judgment of the most appropriate approach is probably the last element of human skill that will be replaced by technology.Real estate brokers used to add value by simply providing access to homes and information that the general public doesn't have, including driving around and showing houses. Nowadays, much of that has been replaced by information portals online and the real estate salespersons who work for the real estate brokers.Since the position of the real estate salespersons (at least in California) is more tenuous, they tend to obfuscate their disadvantage by calling themselves real estate agents, which is a term that can only be accurately applied to real estate brokers. Since most consumers don't know that distinction, it's working for now. To further the obfuscation, the national association of real estate created the brand name of Realtor that both real estate salespersons and brokers can use.But, in the end, it's who can solve the most problems that count and real estate brokers, especially the seasoned ones, are the best equipped for that, even over real estate salesperson and definitely better than the general public.",2 followers,Steven Burton,1.1K,720,14.7M,2016,https://www.quora.com/How-can-real-estate-agents-be-replaced-by-technology

And that’s not even touching the iPad, iPhone, AirPods, etc.Basically no one. No one is close to replacing Apple, much less “soon”. It just won’t happen. Apple is a unique company that holds a special place in the market that allows them to be a leader.

2,"Apple is a design company, not a technology company. It designs WITH technology, other companies fail at design and are not organized to leverage design. Apple’s design-centrism also means they can’t grow their core organization much beyond it’s current size. But you can find commercial precursors for every Apple device after the Apple ][.","24,638 followers",Terry Lambert,777,23.1K,77.3M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-disruptive-technology-is-on-the-rise-and-will-replace-Apple-soon
3,"Apple, like Blackberry and Nokia did in the past, produces end-to-end solutions - i.e. it makes the software and hardware for its products.And, as Blackberry and Nokia have already shown, that's a risky space to be in.The iPhone generates more than half of Apple's revenue. With its sales in decline, Apple’s decline has already started.Apple has cash reserves of a staggering ~US$300B, nearly a third of its market cap, and it has a diversified range of products, so it's not going to do a Blackberry. Its decline will be FAR more gradual.Android has been making inroads into iPhone territory sinceApple, like Blackberry and Nokia did in the past, produces end-to-end solutions - i.e. it makes the software and hardware for its products.And, as Blackberry and Nokia have already shown, that's a risky space to be in.The iPhone generates more than half of Apple's revenue.

Apple will never match Android's software, ubiquity, and individual choice - it will always be fighting an uphill struggle.SoftwareUbiquityChoiceThe iPhone's main selling point is that an iPhone is a status symbol, a brand to aspire to. That counts for a lot. But it won't be enough.Apple urgently needs someone with a new radical vision for Apple, someone that innovates rather than milks its legacy products. Else its decline will continue.Apple needs another Jobs.","9,879 followers",Kenzi Mudge,1.8K,1.3K,8.3M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-disruptive-technology-is-on-the-rise-and-will-replace-Apple-soon

5,"Prof. Cleyton M Christensen of Harvard business school introduced the ‘market’ term called the ‘Disruptive Technology’. He describes it as a technology that unexpectedly displaces an old technology in such a way that the old technology becomes redundant and is phased out. Introduction of automobiles were an ‘innovative’ technology no doubt, but not a ‘disruptive’ one since, in those early days, automobiles remained as an interesting luxury ‘toy’ in the hands of a few, horse drawn carriages were still the norm.

But introduction of mass-produced automobile like the ‘Model T’ from Ford virtually replaced horse drawn carriages and is considered ‘disruptive’.Social perspective“The plan is like this, we first take the night train to Madurai, reaching there in the morning”.“Ummm….”“Then we take a car and straight go to Kodaikanal, we reach by noon”“Ummm….”“You know where I have booked up this time? Guess what, karlton”.“Ummm….”I realized that my teenage daughter was not paying attention. Her fingers were busy dancing across the Smartphone, typing out text messages.“Why can’t you listen at least, I took so much of pain and trouble for arranging this holiday. You are not even interested”. I was visibly upset.“Ummm….”.“What ummm?”“Ohh papa I am listening”.One more time Smartphone proves to be smarter than a dumb parent.Medical perspectiveWhen I joined my third year of medical curriculum, during the surgical posting, 9 out of 10 general surgical procedures would be some kind of surgery for peptic ulcer. A part of the stomachs was removed with cutting off the vagus nerve (which triggers off the gastric acid secretion) a technique called ‘gastrectomy’ and’ vagotomy’. Faster the surgeon more was his status. By 1980 Prof James black discovered a novel kind of drug that blocked the receptors in the stomach that resulted in profound reduction of acid secretion. It was a new concept, acting like a wrong key in the lock. The receptor, like the lock got essentially jammed by the drug, making the real key useless and the lock failed to work. Acid in stomach came down. The implication of the discovery of H2 bolceker drugs (Cimetidine and Ranitidine) were such that by the time I was doing my MD in medicine, routine peptic ulcer surgery became history. Disruptive technology at work in medicine.Blocked artery in the heart, birth defects, as well as heart valve disease, beyond a stage, were once considered treatable only by open heart surgery, Today with the advent of percutaneous catheter based interventions majority of them go home cured without a scar and anesthesia. Another example of disruptive technology.EndnoteSmartphone, I believe, is disruptive technology number one. Not because it made land phone redundant. It has made sure that family chitchats and relations are destroyed beyond redemption, forever.I was ready to go to bed.In the corner of my cell phone the ‘message’ icon was blinking.“Is Der swimng pool in dat hotel ? den tell amma 2 pak d hair straightner :)”Disruptive technology or disruptive generation?","58,988 followers",Michael Wolfe,504,2K,17.3M,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-disruptive-technology-is-on-the-rise-and-will-replace-Apple-soon
