The good thing with tetraethyl lead was that it also lubricated the valves.So General Motors, Du Pont and Standard Oil founded the Ethyl Corporation to produce tetraethyl lead and sell it to fuel manufacturers. Engine compression ratios, engine power and top speeds could be raised and everyone was happy.For a while. It came that several Ethyl Corporation employees began to demonstrate symptoms of saturnism and one employee died from it.As a chemical engineer, when I hear “organoplumbic compound” it is a signal to run fast. Tetraethyllead is extremely toxic, and it is especially damaging to children’s brains. Lead has also a nasty tendency to enrich in the food chain and causeA much viable alternative - ethanol - had been available since the beginning, but Midgley had dismissed it as “too trivial”. The World War Two saw a gigantic expansion on Otto engines - especially aircraft engines - and while the RAF had resolved the knock issue with aromatic compounds, American aviation fuel contained immense amounts of lead - it can be easily observed by white exhaust stains on cowlings and fuselages. That is lead oxide - widely also used as paint pigment!leaded fuel ran lean creates white exhaust stainsGazillions of tonnes of fuel were burnt for over three decades. Then in the 1950s, a geologist Clair Patterson (1922–1995) wanted to determine the age of the Earth from uranium and its decay. The problem was that radioactive heavy elements eventually decay into lead, and he found all his rock samples contained much more lead than what was expected - and they were contaminated all around the world!The culprit was air - there was lead in the air all around the world. In the end Patterson built a hermetically sealed lab and was able to determine the age of Earth as 4550 million +/-70 million years (which is also today’s estimate). But Patterson got alarmed. He published how lead in the atmosphere had contaminated the air - and it was everywhere. He published his research results on atmospheric lead in 1971. Naturally the automotive industry was not amused, and it tried to silence him.Finally the health authorities in the USA and Europe got alarmed too. Despite the lobbying of industry, leaded fuel was prohibited - first in the USA 1986 and five years later in the European Union.Turned out ethanol is a much better anti-knock agent and completely harmless. It lacks the lubricative properties of tetraethyllead, though - but as the lifespan of engines is limited, the solution was simply scrapping the old engines when they came to age. Modern Otto engines are much more fuel efficient than those of the 1960s and 1970s. As of March 2017, only Algeria, Yemen and Iraq continue widespread use of leaded gasoline for automobiles.But much of the lead is still in the air, and it diminishes by a nasty-looking first order differential equation. It is estimated the American average IQ is two points lower than what it could be due to the lead in the air. The problem is especially prevalent in cities and suburbia. The situation is less dire in Europe due to the popularity of mass transport and diesel engines, but bad still.Lead does not only impair cognitive development, but it also increases aggression on those who have the MAOA2 genetic variant and increases promiscuous behaviour. The violent crime numbers have decreased everywhere in the First World during the past thirty years, and I can well remember that from my own youth - the teens are far less violent today than what they were when I was young. Likewise unwanted pregnancies are far fewer today than they were in my youth.Leaded fuel is still allowed to be used in aero piston engines - simply because many of them are decades old legacy engines, many dating to World War Two. Fortunately the turboprop engine has superseded piston engines in all but the very smallest private aircraft, and turbine engines have used unleaded fuel since the beginning. Still the private aviation releases over 200 tonnes of lead into atmosphere annually, and children living next to airfields tend to have much higher concentrations of lead in their bloood than their inner city relatives.Reduction in the average blood lead level is believed to have been a major cause for falling violent crime rates in the First World. A statistically significant correlation has been found between the usage rate of leaded gasoline and violent crime: the violent crime curve virtually tracks the lead exposure curve with a 22-year time lag. After the ban on tetraethyllead, blood lead levels in US children dramatically decreased. Researchers say that declining exposure to lead is responsible for an up to 56% decline in crime from 1992 to 2002. Taking into consideration other factors that are believed to have increased crime rates over that period, the researchers found that the reduced exposure to lead led to an actual decline of 34% over that period.Although leaded fuel is largely gone in the First World, it has left high concentrations of lead in the soil adjacent to roads that were heavily used prior to its phaseout. Children are particularly at risk if they consume this.",2 followers,Himanshu Chavhan,20.4K,71,659.8K,2021,https://www.quora.com/How-far-will-technology-advance-by-the-2060s

Being permanently connected to the internet means there's always something vying for your attention.Apps are designed to make you excited to use them and keep you hooked.Instagram, Snapchat, Facebook, WhatsApp, Twitter and every stupid mobile game all spam you with notifications.These apps make people miserable. Lots of studies have shown the negative impacts of social media.Recent example:They make you constantly crave attention and validation from others and place everyone in your social group in a state of silent, passive aggressive competition. Let me be clear, Internet.Stop rubbing your success in other people's faces. It's rude and it makes other people miserable.The rudeness and noise of social media, and the nagging of games and apps drives me mad. It ruins concentration and is generally a waste of time.I love the ability to have a phone, calculator, games console, camera, encyclopedia, TV, dvd player, MP3 player, bookshelf, egg timer, newspaper, torch, satnav, photo album, pen drive, radio, hands free kit and Internet portal in my hands, all day, every day. I used to have to carry so much other stuff around! Hell, put a knife, corkscrew and a bottle opener on it any you don't even need a Swiss army knife anymore either.Of course somebody already did that…I guess my point is, mobile phones are great, but people can be oblivious to the irritation that they cause others when they use them, and the constant nagging from notifications is a curse for your mental health./Rant overImages from Google",UNKNOWN,Guy D.

One less-than-highly toxic metal alone being used to construct a rechargeable cell?Sadly, to date, it has been too good to be true. Nickel-Air cells are found in pharmacies as single use cells for hearing aids. They have a special plastic seal that is removed to expose them to air and while they are smaller and more powerful than Lithium or Mercury counterparts, they have a fixed life after unsealing. I have found no further evidence of work on a rechargeable version.Further because their life is fixed after unsealing, they are inappropriate to replace long-term low-use cells in remote controls etc.. :(The next big leap that we are likely to see sooner than later is Lithium-Graphene cells. The existing Graphite electrodes are prone to cracking and decay (even when not in use) which is why Li-Ion and LiPo have to be replaced and recycled so often. The graphene electrode (developed by a high school student) promises potentially ten times the capacity per cell and ten times the re-useable life-span. How much rounding of numbers has been done to give us the magic “10” I don’t know, but it certainly promises better capacity and better safety than what we are using at the moment.","58,988 followers",Michael Wolfe,504,2K,17.3M,2017,https://www.quora.com/How-far-will-technology-advance-by-the-2060s

That is exactly what we want to see happening. And one huge advantage of putting the battery complex next to the solar farm is that both solar panels and batteries are DC devices. It significantly reduces expense to collocate them and have them share a DC to AC inverter:EOS is working with partner companies to establish manufacturing plants near the consumers. Let’s say Australia decides to build out a massive solar complex in their desert interior. EOS would want to sell them large numbers of batteries to make that power “dispatchable”. To do that it is too expensive to ship from the US, so EOS would build an entire battery plant in Australia and close to the end-users.","45,628 followers",David Seidman,790,3.6K,85.1M,2019,https://www.quora.com/How-far-will-technology-advance-by-the-2060s
