1,"There was a time when there was a tag attached to each and every software developer. Some of them were C developers, some were C++, java, python etc.People used to learn languages and applications/products were built from ground up using these languages. People used to reinvent the wheel for each and every product. But today, there are frameworks that have extracted the commonality from all those products and made the development of products much easier. Also, these frameworks give flexibility to choose any language of your choice.So in today's industry, first you learn some language, then yoThere was a time when there was a tag attached to each and every software developer. Some of them were C developers, some were C++, java, python etc.People used to learn languages and applications/products were built from ground up using these languages. People used to reinvent the wheel for each and every product. But today, there are frameworks that have extracted the commonality from all those products and made the development of products much easier. Also, these frameworks give flexibility to choose any language of your choice.So in today's industry, first you learn some language, then you specialize in some frameworks, and then there are domains on top of that. For example there are people who know java as a language, hadoop as a framework and work in telecom domain, or finance domain, or healthcare domain.With the pace at which new frameworks are coming in the market, Its difficult to predict whats gonna last for long. Every other day, we hear of frameworks that fill the gaps in old frameworks.My advice is to become master in at least one language (could be java or C/C++), understand multiple frameworks (important to figure out which one works in which use case), and become expert in at least one of them. Domain is something which is generally learned based on the job that you are doing. You can not first specialize in a domain and then start finding a job. You first get a job based on language and framework proficiency and then you learn the domain for which you need to solve problems.ME: I started as a C developer 12 years ago, mastered hadoop 6 years ago, got a feel of other frameworks in big data domain, and worked in telecom domain.
