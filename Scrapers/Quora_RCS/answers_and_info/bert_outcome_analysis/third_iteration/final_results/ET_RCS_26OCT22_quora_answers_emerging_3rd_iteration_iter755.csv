3,"It's not a matter of technology. It a matter of dollars. A number of years ago I was mayor of a small town. We were doing a road and sewer project with a large local contractor. In a far ranging discussion this contractor told me how Europeans build their roads much better as they believe they will save money in the long term. In the US we don't seem to have that long term philosophy. As a result government officials spec out our highways so the short term cost is less. As a result, our roads don't last as long.","30,687 followers",Noam Kaiser,1.3K,3.5K,29.6M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-next-technological-advance-in-terms-of-road-building

7,"To start with, the question is a bit off simply because tablets and smartphonesI’ve been using tablets for at least a decade, but the first big change was my Galaxy Tab 12.2, in 2014.

This one had a good 12 hours of battery life, a Wacom pencil, and enough memory for a good working system. I could not do my CAD work on this, but then again, I could barely be productive doing CAD work on a tiny laptop with a single screen.The tablet did every general purpose thing I used my computer for as well as the computer. Not the hard stuff. For meetings, it was substantially better — I could take notes with the pen, meaning that it was far easier to draw, rather than write. Engineering is a visual language, not a written one, for the most part. On business trips, I sometimes bring a Bluetooth keyboard — the touch screen is nice for a self-contained unit, but always a trade-off.You may have noticed that people these days are upgrading their smartphones every 2–3 years or so. How often do they replace their laptops or desktops? For some people, these replace computers, SatNavs, cameras, PMPs, notepads, watches, and, of course, phone.Because, of course a smartphone is a phone is the same way a Swiss Army knife is a knife. Yeah, that function’s is in there, but it’s probably not in the top ten or twenty on your list of useful smartphone functions.More to the point, your smartphone represents the fourth major revolution in application computing, and so of course you’re going to replace your old stuff with it. The first revolution: computers. Huge, room-sized things only affordable by large companies. If you — a mere mortal — wanted to use a computer in the 1960s or early-to-mid 1970s, you probably had to use a terminal to dial up someone else’s computer. And you might have even had to pay for this, monthly or even hourly.The next major revolution was the personal computer — you could have a computer in your home. The computer wasn’t a never-seen thing you called up, it was a place you went. Your office, your computer room, etc. You could decide which programs it ran, you could buy new ones for the first time, you could add accessories, even open it up and hack it yourself (hopefully knowing what you were doing).The next important jump, though expanding about a bit from applications, is the advent of ubiquitous computing and connectivity. Computers are always networked, and they’re everywhere. In fact, those things are tightly coupled: the modem you use, the router you use, etc… those all contain full computer systems (a good portion of home routers run Linux). And once that sort of networked computer could run a router, similar low cost technology would be wired and designed to do a zillion other small digital jobs.This lead to the aforementioned ubiquitous use of computers… pretty much anything that says “digital” is a computer. Things you didn’t expect. Your CD player, your DVD/BD player, your camera, your washing machine, etc. became a computer, practically overnight. And your TV! Maybe not all at once, but today, there are no radio signals going to any my TVs other than WiFi — everything’s IPTV, even the over-the-air stuff (I have Silicon Dust networked receivers that stream OTA video as just another kind of networked digital data).And add in the Internet of Things (IoT), and now I have light switches, thermostats, coffee makers, garage door openers, doorbells, smoke alarms, etc. that are not just computers, but connected computers.And today, in the fourth phase, computers are a thing you have with you, everywhere, and always on a network. Your smartphone is the most personal of computers, because it’s always with you. As a “place you go”, your home PC is less personal. As a “computer guy” I have always had my own PCs not shared by the family, but plenty of times, when I had little kids, the computer was a centralized resource. Guests sometimes ask to use a computer. But think about it — it’s kind of weird for someone to use your smartphone, aside from emergency phone calls.And you probably use your smartphone for a ton of things that used to be done on the PC. And a bunch of new things the PC doesn’t do. Things are moving to increase that. I have a number of Internet of Things (IoT) support apps that only run on phones or tablets, not desktop PCs. You don’t typically find augmented reality apps for a PC — you’re not carrying that around a city. Or SatNav apps.This doesn’t meant PCs are being completely replaced for all things. But think about it. When I moved into my first house in 1984, I definitely had a few computers: one Commodore 128, one modem, and three 1571 disc drives. So I’m certain I had five computers, though only one “application processor”, aka, personal computer. In my room here today, I can easily count 45 computers, just in my office/mancave here. So you might just imagine that, while the desktop is important enough to me to have (hey, even for Quora, real keyboards rock!), it’s hard to be as attached to one system when I have all these other computers doing work for me. And between the tablet and phone, I’m computing more than ever, but less of that’s done on a personal computer, and some sorts of computing I never do on the desktop.And how about the numbers. Even what you see here, my desk with three monitors, PC hidden underneath to the left, hasn’t been the driving factor for consumer computing for a long time. Heck, laptops outsold desktops for the first time in 2005. In 2020, about 275 million PCs were sold, the most since 2015, largely due to the Pandemic. Also in 2020, about 1.38 billion smartphones were sold — a bit down from prior years, also due to the pandemic. The most popular personal computing OS today is Android, and iOS is getting pretty close to Windows, particularly in consumer use.","74,719 followers",Tiny Nair,776,689,28M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-next-technological-advance-in-terms-of-road-building

Why do I like it so much? Because when I purchased it, I wanted a phone I could make and receive telephone calls with. This little beauty has never failed on that front.Then Apple invented the IPhone. Since then, with few exceptions, all phones have been boring rectangles. I'll concede they are extremely feature packed boring rectangles, but boring rectangles they still are.Don't get me wrong, most of the phones I own are boring rectangles. I've got phones with 5000mah batteries, when that was something to brag about. I've got phones with night vision cameras, because why not? I've got a phone with a FLIR thermal camera because it looked cool.But ultimately, they're all just boring rectangles, because a phone company in Cupertino decided their phones were going to be boring rectangles, and everyone else has to follow suit.In 2036 I want phones like my SL55. Not the same specs, but the same ethos. Design, function, form-factor. Something different to everything else out there.
