1,"It depends if we have a tech revolution or not. If you compare 2007 and 2017 technology, the change isn’t that noticable in our everyday lives. But take another decade - 1994 to 2004… there was a huge change because the Internet revolution happened and we all moved online :)So in ten years we will certainly see some incremental improvement - gadgets like the next smartphone iterations, bigger nicer TV’s, flexible LCD screens.But it’s still not clear if we’ll see huge, revolutionary change.

There are two big things looming on the horizon, though. The smaller one is the mass deployment of electric cars. This implies big political (because oil will no longer be so important) and environmental (much cleaner air in cities) change.The really big revolution might be the coming of AI. I’m not so sure about the pop-culture AI horrors of aggressive Skynet-like AI’s. What I have no doubt about, though, is that AI will be used commercially and various new AIs will (practically overnight) wipe out huge swathes of jobs. It’ll start with automatic cars replacing cab, bus and truck drivers. Then you’ll see things like AI translators replacing human translators, and if you think that’s a tiny change - computer programming, for example, is basically translating sets of commands from human to computerese. All those desk jobs will be gone. From there, we can move toward some socialist utopia with a guaranteed citizen salary, or into a corporate dystopia with the privileged few “AI owners” who have everything, a small middle class who serves them and vast population of the unemployed.","51,713 followers",Chris Ebbert,906,11.4K,278.6M,2017,https://www.quora.com/How-will-technology-change-in-the-next-10-years

That esteemed expert, my father, asked the following question: who let 3D come back from its gimmicky demiseIn the late 1970s, 3D was the cause of much hype. As time went on, various iterations of 3D were relegated to the cultural trash heap—you only need to think ofDo I think today's 3D is eye-candy and certain to sell any number of theater tickets and HDTVs?
