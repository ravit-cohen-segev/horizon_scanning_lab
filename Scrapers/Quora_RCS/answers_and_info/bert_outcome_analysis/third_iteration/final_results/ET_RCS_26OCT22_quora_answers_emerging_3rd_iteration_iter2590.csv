We areHowever, it’s important for us to realise that we do not exist in isolation and there are perceptible graphic design trends that may or may not influence our decision making. We are communicators of messages and those messages are constantly shaped by patterns in marketing and advertising, architecture, technology, popular culture, as well as social and economic trends.The world around us will ultimately influence the constantly evolving perceptions of visual ideas and therefore influence the visual messages we send. Because of this, there are perceptible trends and cycles that emerge in graphic design.Oddly enough though, we currently do find ourselves in a kind of isolation. In light of Covid-19, we are facing the biggest challenge to our modern society yet. We are already seeing similarities emerge in the responses for designers and we are likely to see some of these patterns remain and become trends.Whether we want to step in line with these trends or defy the norms in favour of another path, understanding these changes and staying on top of key trends in graphic design is a crucial part of being a designer.At the start of 2021, we have so far seen quite polarising trends and like all good, fluctuating movements, it will be interesting to see which remain the dominant trends of the year. Read on for 9 of the current graphic design trends we can expect to see more of this year.1. Design for GoodSara AndreassonAs designers, we are constantly seeking to create something that will make a difference and it’s not the first time we’ve seen creatives step up to the plate to help create positive social impact. Throughout history, designers have used their skills to help extend visual messages about global health crises.From “broadsheet warnings of Indian cholera symptoms issued in 1831 and malaria warning posters from the dark days of 1940s wartime.” Through to “the colourful graffiti painted onto Liberian walls that educated the illiterate on the symptoms of Ebola and warnings of the late 20th century’s principal medical menace—Aids” check out the multiple ways designers haveIn our current situation, we are seeing an upswing in the number of designers creating works and using their platforms to spread the messages about how to slow the spread of coronavirus. This is taking the form of powerful images and animations to try and spread the message, including visual depictions of symptoms and providing some comic-relief through representations of self-quarantine.Check out the awesome typographic illustrations by2. Even More MinimalismNew Logo and Identity for Uber by Wolff Olins and In-houseReflecting the ongoing importance placed on the honesty and transparency of businesses in today’s landscape, minimalism really flourished in 2019 and is expected to continue well into the 2020s. “Design will continue to strip away extra flair and embellishment and move toward a much simpler, straightforward presentation,” says group creative director Brian Dixon atThis means design will be all about trust and believability and therefore tend towards simple or intuitive visual elements; flat designs, two-dimensional illustrations, primary colours, easy-to-read typography and even veering into design that feels intentionally unfinished. Andy Capper, creative director at3. SustainabilityConserva CollectiveIn addition to honesty and transparency, consumers around the world are now prioritising our relationships with our earth and vastly questioning the impact of certain materials and production processes on the environment. This in turn, is urging brands to review the design of their products.This new favour of eco-conscious products will lead to further simplification of materials, packaging and branding and will mean a continued focus on design that feels organic, calming and natural. Check out this example of minimal plastic-free packaging design for“More brands are trying to make a positive contribution by transitioning towards innovative approaches to packaging, such as using recyclable or ethically sourced materials,” says Charlie Smith, creative director at4. Type-OnlySeachangeHowever, not all designers are choosing to take the calm and minimal road. There are a growing number of designers taking an experimental, type-only approach and exploring more artistic or decorative typography and playing with scale. We’re also seeing a rise in designs that are typography-led over photography or illustration. Nazar Begen, Head of Project atTake a look at this unexpected, experimental approach to branding byAnd it’s not just sustainability campaigns taking this approach, we’re seeing full brand identities emerge that are letting typography take centre stage. For example, 2019’s branding for Assembly hotel by5. Mixed MediaWe Are CollinsEven more designers are beginning to rebel against the ubiquitous flat design aesthetic that emerged in 2017 and is continuing into 2020. Another trend we’ve been seeing is an explosion of overlapping and more layered compositions that play with texture, volume and analog materials laid out in a collage-like manner. We’re seeing designers experiment with depth-creation and a mix of varied elements such as photography and illustration with torn paper edges, fabrics, cutout text and even paint strokes.Consuela Onighi, UX designer atThis beautiful campaign forEven our own Shillington students are on top of this trend! This6. Three-DimensionalDiller Scofidio + RenfroFurthermore to the emergence of the layering approach to creating depth, we’ve also seen a marked increase in designs utilising 3D elements over the last year. Thanks to today’s technology and software capabilities, it is becoming a lot easier to create 3D graphics. Therefore, we will expect to see much more of these awesome 3D graphic design compositions.This visual identity and campaign byMoreover, designers are often combining it with other visual elements, such as photography and 2-dimensional objects. These 3D designs by7. Motion and AnimationIn a world where attention spans are becoming shorter and shorter, we’re seeing more and more brands using moving content to further cut through the noise, capture attention and create more interesting experiences for their audiences. Even simple animations like GIFs, achievable for any graphic designer, are having a big moment.Mark Chatelier, executive creative director atEmma Newnes ofFor the future seekers, Los Angeles-based motion giants Man vs. Machine are inspirational as ever, creating incredible multi-sensorial motion campaigns for8. Zero Negative SpaceBaptiste CarinAt complete odds with a trend towards minimalist, some designers are rebelling to create a fresh and revived experience through to use of maximalist, edge-to-edge designs. By filling the page completely, leaving no negative space behind, the results can be energetic, loud and fun.“There are signature works by established designers whose work embodies this trend, such asSloboda says, “This trend has been around for a while and it comes back periodically. In 2020, however, designers should be more careful about what they want to convey by filling the last empty space and how the final visual feels. It can be pleasing, provocative, abstract or full of information—as long as it’s constructed with an intention.”9. Breaking the RulesFixture font by SudtiposPerhaps refreshingly, this year we are seeing a greater number of designers scraping the rule book altogether, getting experimental and pushing the boundaries of graphic design. This kind of approach is a great way to create visual tension in your designs. It’s raw and unpolished and stands out well enough to grab attention.The unpolished look is no longer reserved for small, rebellious start-ups trying to make their mark. And this is a good thing, according to Curro de la Villa, Creative Director atPerhaps it’s that quest for imperfection that has inspired the one broken rule that is topping them all, stretched typography. Stretched typography has emerged as a trend with the new innovations of“What we were first taught not to do, we now do by intention,” saysThe graphic design trends of 2020 seem to exist on a wide spectrum that can only be exemplary of the same polarization that exists in the world around us. The last few years have seen a spotlight shone on the honesty and transparency of businesses, the immediacy and global concern of environmental degradation, alongside mass political division. Now, in the light of Covid-19, we are facing the biggest challenge to our modern society yet.These are factors that we all have an individual reaction to. Therefore it’s only natural that the same division in social responses can also be seen in the visual messages that we as designers are creating. From ultra-minimalism through to throwing out the graphic design rulebook in protest, we can expect to see a vast array of exciting trends emerge this year. Hang on to your hats, it’s going to be a wild ride.","7,437 followers",Xianhang Zhang,1.6K,812,2.5M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-advanced-technologies-in-graphic-design

Germany laughs when he sees this, and taunts USA.Big mistake. Because USA is big. Scary big. FREAKISHLY big. And now he goes wild, kicking Japan and hitting Germany at the same time.Germany and USSR are still fighting, bleeding, screaming. UK and USA jump on Germany from behind and the three hit him with everything they’ve got: CRACK! Germany loses two ribs. KTOW! And another rib! TWOCK!! His jaw! SMASH! His kidney!Germany staggers. Then USSR lands a final sickening blow in his face … and Germany goes down.USA turns around. A final bone-shattering blow, and Japan just drops.The brawl is over.So why did Germany lose?

Today's principle of nuclear fission reactor power generation is not fundamentally different from steam engines hundreds of years ago! Regardless of the current thermal power or nuclear power, it is heating water: heat converts water into steam, and the steam drives the turbine to generate electricity. (Note: The conversion rate of nuclear fission we use today is only 0.135%)It is most likely that human beings will not be able to ""go out"" the solar system, and even be ""trapped"" to die on earth!The nuclear fusion conversion rate is 0.7%. If nuclear fusion power generation is realized, it may alleviate the current energy crisis. It is not enough for interstellar flight. (Note: As science fiction says that ""Positive and Anti-Matter Annihilation"" is the most efficient, can achieve 100% quality conversion, can help us fly out of the solar system. )Realistically, if we fail to master the controllable nuclear fusion before depleting fossil energy, it is not only ""Civilization Retrogression,"" but the entire human sci and tech civilization will be ""locked out"" until we die. Because in those days we will be unable to ""organize higher-scale industrialization"" and not be able to further test our scientific theory.Human beings are powerless and insignificant. Think of Traveler 1, the man-made object farthest from the Earth, and the fastest man-made object. It takes 40,000 years to fly to the AC+79 3888 star of Ophiuchus. It takes 73,600 to fly to Proxima Centauri of Centaur. The interstellar voyage for it is just a simple fantastic lies. How negligible us? Please be humble~As for interstellar travel, if the person who does not wear the spacesuit leaves the surface layer, just like ""The deep sea fish leave the deep sea will detonate himself"", yes, in any other environment, the human body will be vulnerable to ""cannot withstand even a single blow"". Hey, we humans are the creatures born in the surface environment. We are destined to be inseparable from such environment, and it is even more difficult to cross the ""space measured by light years."" The earth is the cradle of humankind and it will surely be our destination and cemetery.Almost all of the Earthian is still bound by gravity, and it is difficult to fly out of it.Humans used to go to the moon with ""The primeval Chemical Rocket,"" but never went to Mars. Most people are trapped in the earth's tiny plot of land, let alone the universe.Although we can now ""observe dozens of billions of light years of the universe"", no matter how influential bigwigs can't leave the earth. They can only be like the common people who feet can't leave the ground. Exhausting the limits of the power of human tech can barely enough landing on the moon, its number can be counted on the fingers of one hand.The natural resources in the universe are inexhaustible, but we can only divide into some hostile factions, scheme against each other, intrigued, mutual suspicion, resorting to deception… excessive competition for such a little bit of unremarkable resource on earth. The human civilization at this stage is still too primitive.I really want to ""strive for the cause of human civilization in the universe all my lifetime"", but now I can only ""work for the sake of making a living and fortune"", such a life is not reconciled.We even have not been able to explore the earth.In terms of crustal exploration, the deepest borehole that our drilled has just reached more than 10,000 meters depth. Our drill bit with difficulty went to the bottom of the crust for humans and took a look at the edge of the mantle. This depth is only equivalent to ""The worm takes a bite of apple peel."" This is why we cannot predict earthquakes because even the ""normal state"" of the crust can only be inferred by indirect evidence, and the judgment of its ""abnormal state"" is even more unreliable.…SummaryIt seems that some of today inventions of ""redoubtable and formidable"" are mostly the advancement of Applied Science, not the progress of Basic Science. The development of personal computers is only consistently integrated and shrinking smaller, supercomputers are always stacking and piled up, naturally, their computing performance is strengthened…But quantitative change is unlikely to trigger a qualitative change. It won't bring us quantum computers.The so-called ""innovative tide and creative spoondrift"" is just something ""in application-level."" Basic theory has been stagnant for a long time, and superstring theory has not progressed for many years. In any case, ""Basic Theory"" is the ""source power"" of human sci and tech development. Tomorrow, we may have some room for growth in the application of tech, but the development of the ""fundamental power"" has not been reformed for a long time!Chier Hu's answer to Has fundamental physics stagnated?Chier Hu's answer to Do you think our technology is primitive?Chier Hu's answer to Why is medical technology so primitive compared to computer technology?Chier Hu's answer to What are some examples showing how underdeveloped or powerless present-day human technology is?","74,722 followers",Tiny Nair,776,689,28M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-was-the-very-cutting-edge-of-technology-science-in-World-War-2

23,"Question: Did God create men or did men create God?Answer: All current evidence points to the conclusion that Man created gods, all gods not just “your” god (your god meaning whoever is reading this who might be a theist of some sort).As an Agnostic Atheist I do not claim to KNOW that there are no gods floating around in this Universe or on some other plane of existence/dimension.

It is possible that they exist and just do not interact with humanity. It is possible that there are lifeforms that were more advanced than the Bronze Age civilizations and that visited this planet and thus were seen as gods (to an ant we might be seen as gods).However, the majority of the gods that have been worshipped by humans down through the ages are no longer believed in. They have been relegated to the realm of Myths and Folklore. All the pantheons of the Greeks tribes, Romans tribes , Germanic tribes, Egyptian tribes, Celtic Tribes, Mesoamerican tribes, African Tribes, etc. have disappeared into the mists of history (or gone on extended vacations).Each time a god stops being worshiped another god is created to take its place. As civilizations gained in knowledge and understanding, the need for many gods to fill various roles diminished and Monotheism was born.YHWH derives from the Canaanite god EL. EL was the god of war and the head of the Canaanite pantheon. As tribes were fighting each other over land and resources needed for survival, a war god was needed and had to be more powerful than the opposing war god. EL was just this god. When the Israelite broke away from the Canaanites they took EL with them. YHWH is referred to as EL throughout the Torah and is seen in many Hebrew words (IsraEL, SamuEL, DaniEL), It is only when asked what his true name was that the YHWH tetragrammaton get expressed. I use YHWH only as an example not to pick on the Abrahamic god.Over 4000 named gods and countless unnamed or prehistorically worshipped gods, and not one shred of real evidence to support any of them. Plenty of faith, and an extreme amount of confusing faith with facts, for each and everyone of them. Some have looked like animals, some like humans, some like a cross between animals and humans, but the majority have disappeared.So again, at this point, all current evidence points to one conclusion: Men create gods.","5,990 followers",Jens Böttiger,566,2.6K,17.6M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-was-the-very-cutting-edge-of-technology-science-in-World-War-2
