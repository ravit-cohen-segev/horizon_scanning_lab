Make sure you do have a little idea about it before you go through my answer.So just the way we use water, electricity etc. as a utility,Perplexed huh? I'll elucidate.We all have to submit our documents vis-a-vis PAN, Aadhaar, bank account details, resume, voter id, medical history etc. at various places. So every time we go to a bank/ govt. office/ hospital, we submit our specific documents separately which does consume some time to cobble, get it all photostat and submit. Now if we upload all our documents on a profile on blockchain which allots an ID to us and all we gotta do is give permission to an authority to have access to our information, it'll save us A LOT of time and fuss. Also, we can control what section of the information can be accessed i.e we are the owner of our identity (database) and we can allow the extent to which the other person can see our identity. We're not leaking our details so the problem that occurred with Aadhaar (data breach case) is quashed.Also, blockchain was prima facie hailed as unhackable but recently I read that there's a probability (very low) of hackers rewriting the transaction history so I don't know how this snag can be dealt with nor do I have the slightest idea about the implementation of this plan. The efficacy of overt and covert issues need to be addressed in which privacy will be a major challenge.So yeah, it wasn't a full fledged idea but if put to everyday use in a secure way, it'll be pretty conducive for the common man to siphon data easily and hence make our lives easier.",211 followers,Aman Goel,548,523,37.1M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-top-10-most-exciting-blockchain-startups

The price was sky high, have issues around privacy, and cultural backlash, this wearable product was not able to connect.2. Tata Nano, Tata Motors (2008)Tata Motors launched the Nano cars with motorcyclists in mind. Tata manufactured the Nano as inexpensively as possible. The price was 100,000 rupees in 2008.However, due to the low prices the company has to cut corners in production, as a result, there were many serious safety flaws. There were some reports that Nanos were bursting into flames after rear collisions. Tata ultimately sold fewer than 8000 Nanons in 2016–17. Due to low sales, Tata Motors announced the end of production without any direct successor. (Only one was assembled in June 2018).3. Facebook Phone, Facebook (2013)The Facebook Phone was surrounded by speculation from the moment the first rumors of it is surfaced. What the public got was HTC first, an android skinned device whose main feature was being geared towards the Facebook Home application. The phones exclusive carrier, AT&T, drastically slashed the price to 99 cents in a “temporary sale” that became permanent until the phone’s death.4. Juicero, Juicero (2013)Juicero was a California-based startup that raised $120M for its fresh-squeezed juice device. But after it was found that its $400, Wi-Fi-enabled machines were no more effective at making juice than squeezing the pre-packaged fruit with your hands, the company shut down within months of its launch.5. Google+, Google (2011-2019)Google+ isn’t the only social outing on this list from the search giant, but it’s probably the highest-profile disappointment. A closed launch made invites a hot commodity for about a week. Then Google discarded their restrained invitation model, throwing open the doors in an attempt to build a user base that never lived up to their expectations of creating a possible Facebook competitor. Google+ was shuttered permanently on April 2, 2019.6. Windows Vista, Microsoft (2007)We all have used the Windows operating system for at least one time in our life. Windows XP was quite successful and about 5 years after the launch of Windows XP, they launched Windows Vista.After review on Vista, it was found out that this is not so user-friendly OS. Microsoft accepted its mistakes and announced to offer XP instead of vista to all the computer manufacturers. Many users downgraded their OS from Vista to XP. It hastened production on Windows 7.7. Windows Phone, Microsoft (2010)Microsoft made up its mind to launch Windows Phone but took a very late step in the world of smartphones. Apple Phones had already created a great impact in the smartphone world. Android phones were already in the market for 2 years. All these things created the problems for Microsoft.The Windows Phone represented less than 1% of the total smartphone market in 2017, according to Recode — Microsoft discontinued the development of new features for the device that same year.The former Nokia engineer said:There are many well-known factors that caused WP’s demise, none of them alone took it down, but here are the ones that stood out most to me:8. Apple Newton (1993–1998)A PDA (personal digital assistant) that suffered from a poorly functioning operating system, the Apple Newton never caught on. However, the development of Apple Newton did indirectly lead to the iPad, proving that learning from failure can lead to great success.9. BlackBerryBefore the iPhone, there was the BlackBerry — or “CrackBerry,” as the devices’ obsessed users affectionately referred to them. Blackberry phones were the first choice for many people and have features like Internet connection, email, chatting on Blackberry Messengers, and many more. Research in Motion, as BlackBerry, was then called, sold more than 50 million of the devices in 2011.Time passed and RIM did not have any changes, it kept up with its trademark physical keyboard and did not bring a full touchscreen like the iPhone. The touchscreen had become quite popular at that time and people were very fond of it.By 2016, BlackBerry was selling only about 4 million devices annually. Blackberry is still in this world but due to its archaic fervor, but one thing has to be accepted company’s devices paved the way for the super-powered smartphones we carry around today.10. MySpaceMyspace was originally launched as a side project. It became the most famous social networking site before Facebook enter the world. It was officially launched in 2004 and gained 1 million users in one month only. MySpace first try to ignore Facebook but later on started copying it.They have poorly designed their interface and faulty applications on the site. No doubt they have an amazing marketing strategy, but from the technical side, they were far behind from other platforms.Facebook and Twitter have continuously rolled out major changes, new features, and redesigned their UI that have helped them to reshaped the social web for better, whereas MySpace remained stagnant for most of the time and never made a comeback.11. SegwayPerhaps no gadget evokes the early turn of the century like the Segway, a personal motorized scooter that riders control by leaning in one direction or another. Designed as a revolutionary new transportation option, Segways have largely been relegated to the realm of the mall cop and tour group. But for whatever reason, technologists never tire of trying to replace the well-proven movement method of walking around — The Great Hoverboard Craze of 2015-16 can trace its origins directly to this stand-up scooter.Sources: 1)2)3)Image credits: Google.Thank you!",0 followers,Abhishek Raj,3.9K,62,665.5K,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-top-10-most-exciting-blockchain-startups

The Germans in particular enter Tanganyika and claim it as their own.See those two Africans holding the dead animal? Yeah, those are slaves.See, Germans are efficient. Instead of bringing in labour from their country, which was a tedious affair, they forced indigenous tribes to work for them. They also imposed heavy taxation on them, because why not.Naturally, those tribes were not happy.So what do you do when some white guys take your livestock and steal your women?Simple. You REBEL AGAINST THOSE ASSHATS!That’s where our valiant revolutionary, Mr. Kinjekitile Ngwale, comes in. He told his fellow Africans that he was a prophet sent by the ancestors to get rid of the Germans. So he became the leader of the rebellion. Just like that.One tiny problem though…the Germans had GUNS. Lots of guns. The Africans only had spears and arrows. If you’ve ever played rock paper scissors you know how it feels when you put paper and everyone puts scissors. That’s how the Africans felt.So Mr. Kinjekitile Ngwale came up with an idea…Using his extensive knowledge as a witchdoctor, he mixed water, castor oil, and millet seeds. He claimed the concoction, when applied on the body,As soon as the Germans saw the Africans approaching, they…well…read this excerpt:Several thousand Maji warriors, led by a spirit medium, marched toward the Reich's compound at Mahenge. As soon as the rebels were within firing range, soldiers, backed by two machine guns, laid down a lethal fire. Row upon row of Maji warriors marched toward the guns, but were cut down.Hundreds were killed or wounded before breaking off the engagement.Kinjeketile was later captured and hanged by the Germans for ‘treason’.

Yesterday the multi-page websites were popular, today the trend for simplicity brought single-page apps back on the top, so I'll tell you a couple tips aboutProgressive Web ApplicationsThe world first heard about progressive web apps in 2015. The next year we met the pioneers of this technology, and in 2017 progressive Web Applications seem to have become the major competitor of native mobile apps.Progressive web appsWeb development trends are changing rapidly. Yesterday the multi-page websites were popular, today the trend for simplicity brought single-page apps back on the top, so I'll tell you a couple tips aboutProgressive Web ApplicationsThe world first heard about progressive web apps in 2015. The next year we met the pioneers of this technology, and in 2017 progressive Web Applications seem to have become the major competitor of native mobile apps.Progressive web appsOnline customer support2016 was the year of chatbots. 2018 will be the year of helpful chatbots. Since there are thousands of bots out now, the quality of their services will be the next web development trend.The prediction is that 85% of all customer interactions will proceed without human assistance till 2020.A customer service chatbot becomes a must on almost every website. Whether you are selling electronics, crocheted toys or software development services, you should have a chatbot.Static websitesYou definitely remember the concept of a static website from the early years of the World Wide Web. All the first websites on the Internet were static.But then the era of dynamic websites began.Websites became more functional and easier to update even for people with no technical background. At the same time, the development process became more complicated, as the extended functionality required communication with the server, so backend development got involved. Modern CMSs are the actual dynamic websitesNowadays, the web is returning to its roots. Static websites are becoming the web development trend of 2018 again.Single-page websitesAnother web development trend for simplicity is single-page websites. This solution allows putting all the content onto one long scrollable page, removing any clutter.One-page websites have a bunch of advantages. They don’t challenge the visitor with complex navigation, multi-level menu, and tons of text. The essential information is all on one page. The user only has to scroll to it.Of course, the use-cases of single-pagers are limited. This type of website will not suit e-commerce projects and blogs. At the same time, businesses can significantly benefit, presenting their services in a simplified and more engaging manner.Push notifications for websitesMobile apps notifications turned out to be a highly efficient means of user re-engagement. And recently this idea has been implemented for websites and is becoming new web development trend.The workflow looks quite simple: the user visits a website and is offered to enable push notifications. The user will then be notified of any changes on the website (like a new blog post or a private message), even after he has closed the tab with that website.The major benefit of such a technology is obvious - you can keep the user engaged without big efforts.Flash to HTMLIn 2010 Steve Jobs published hisThe major weakness of this technology is the incompatibility with mobile devices. An enormous amount of traffic is lost just because of the outdated technology.Motion UISimplicity is the trend in recent years. This is also true for web design. Users are already tired of crazy GIFs and flashing ads, that’s why websites with moderate design get more appreciation.At the same time, sophisticated motion UI is becoming more popular. Animations allow to add more style and enable you to distinguish your website from the thousands of others with the static UI.There are several ways to add some life to your minimalistic website. Consider page header transitions, nice hovers, animated charts, background animations and modular scrolling. These and many other elements may make your web presence much more enjoyable for users. The true artwork!JavaScript - Angular 2 and Angular 4JavaScript is the number one programming language for web applications. With dozens of JS-related technologies already existing and still in development, it will even strengthen its positions. The highly anticipated release of the last years Angular 2 becomes highly appreciated in modern web development.We met Angular 2 in 2016. It is a complete rewrite of the AngularJS framework. The main advantages are improved modularity, app architecture scalability,PHP 7.x - Laravel 5.xPHP remains the popular choice for website backend development. This programming language has improved its positions even further after the release of version 7.x. The latest update of the PHP framework Laravel 5.x is a recognized web development trend in 2018.Laravel is the most popular open-source PHP web framework. All the benefits of it can be fully experienced on dynamic websites with complicated backend.Laravel offers ready solutions for complex tasks. The variety of existing packages makes the development process faster and more reliable. Regular updates ensure that the framework complies with the current needs of the website owners and the requirements of the time.Also I decided to describe the anti-trends of the year as well.
