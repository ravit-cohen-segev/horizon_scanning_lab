Some estimate there are at least 500 allotropes of carbon. Graphene has a multitude of unique properties and we have just scratched the surface of it as far as what we know of it. However, given the rate of technological change, computational chemistry, Artifical Intelligence, the explosion in GPU design and manufacture, our knowledge of graphene will advance considerably within the next five years.Progress is currently being made in the technology necessary to produce graphene in large wide sheets. This will allow for much more efficient purification of very large amounts of water, which would be wise to get into.Grapheneis one of those things with such a wide range of unique qualities that it is a Golden Goose. Thus it may be wise to do a deep dive into it.Where it is now in economic impact, is similar to a train just before beginning to move. Within the next five years it will develop momentum. In ten, it will reach cruising speed of a bullit train.So your timing could not be better, as it allows for a full education as to the possibilities before pulling the trigger.I would also watch asphaltene. I know of a guy who has developed and patented a process to make it.If electric cars kill the internal combustion engine, and thus gasoline as a fuel, asphaltene may save oil companies from a certain death.There are more gems to come, but this should keep you quite busy.Good luck and remember me when you cash the first check!Addendum:There is one more fascinating carbon area,Nitrogen Vacancy Centers in DiamondRecently, this has been used to noninvasively visualize the inner workings of a neuron in a living creature in real time.

I believe that the ability of our children to access pornographic and outrageously violent material on video games rated for adults is spiraling out of control.- US senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, 2005The effect of rock and roll on young people, is to turn them into devil worshippers; to stimulate self-expression through sex; to provoke lawlessness; impair nervous stability and destroy the sanctity of marriage. It is an evil influence on the youth of our country.- Minister Albert Carter, 1956Many adults think that the crimes described in comic books are so far removed from the child's life that for children they are merely something imaginative or fantastic. But we have found this to be a great error. Comic books and life are connected. A bank robbery is easily translated into the rifling of a candy store. Delinquencies formerly restricted to adults are increasingly committed by young people and children ... All child drug addicts, and all children drawn into the narcotics traffic as messengers, with whom we have had contact, were inveterate comic-book readers This kind of thing is not good mental nourishment for children!- Fredric Wertham, Seduction of the Innocent, 1954The free access which many young people have to romances, novels, and plays has poisoned the mind and corrupted the morals of many a promising youth; and prevented others from improving their minds in useful knowledge. Parents take care to feed their children with wholesome diet; and yet how unconcerned about the provision for the mind, whether they are furnished with salutary food, or with trash, chaff, or poison?- Reverend Enos Hitchcock, Memoirs of the Bloomsgrove Family, 1790Does the telephone make men more active or more lazy?

It is quite sufficient to cast one's eyes on the voluptuous intertwining of the limbs, and close compressure of the bodies ... to see that it is far indeed removed from the modest reserve which has hitherto been considered distinctive of English females. So long as this obscene display was confined to prostitutes and adulteresses, we did not think it deserving of notice; but now that it is ... forced on the respectable classes of society by the evil example of their superiors, we feel it a duty to warn every parent against exposing his daughter to so fatal a contagion.- The Times of London, 1816","246,826 followers",Dushka Zapata,1.5K,8.5K,232.3M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-next-big-revolution-in-terms-of-technology-that-is-going-to-blow-our-minds-soon-and-how-may-I-position-myself-to-cash-in-on-it

23,"Mind activationThis is not new. Plenty of experiments have been conducted. What will be new though is the form this will take as products, systems, and services. We are looking at technology that will do what it is supposed to be doing when we think it should be doing it.Mobile phones may just be like a little in-ear plug that dials a contact we want it to dial up, and it will transmit a thought message or image to that contact.We will see software that records dreamsMind activationThis is not new. Plenty of experiments have been conducted. What will be new though is the form this will take as products, systems, and services. We are looking at technology that will do what it is supposed to be doing when we think it should be doing it.Mobile phones may just be like a little in-ear plug that dials a contact we want it to dial up, and it will transmit a thought message or image to that contact.We will see software that records dreams and plays them.We will see vehicles that stop because we think they should.And so on. It will be a move away from visual and haptic controls. The advantages are clear: Faster, more discreet, unedited. And a lot more inclusive of individuals who are unable to make use of their eyes or hands perfectly. It may also represent an opportunity to start interfacing with animals. We may understand what animals are thinking, and we may be able to speak to them in ways they can relate to, because software will facilitate brainwave translation in the form of transmitted emotion through brainwave stimulation.I look forward to that sort of world.Can you imagine going bird watching and listening to what the birds are saying?

Pacemakers, stents, and other implants already represent steps in this direction but when sensory or brain function is augmented, that is when radical departures will take place.Science fiction author, Peter Hamilton, postulates an excellent example of this with his “biotek”. Imagine having a chip implanted (after puberty) at the base of your neck which grows molecular tendrils into your brain and stores every sensation and thought that you experience. You become a perfect court witness as you now can recall every event with exact detail. Every day or week, the implanted chip’s data is downloaded to a server farm so that all of your memories are stored outside of your body in case of accidental injury.What’s more, upon reaching your physical prime, your physical body is cloned and embryonic copies are held in suspended animation. That way, if you suffer body death, one of the embryos can be grown under accelerated conditions, a new chip implanted, and your memory restored via an upload from the server farm where all of your memories are stored. Hey presto! You are alive once more.In addition, as your body wears out from old age, a new one can be grown and updated with all of your memories,This is one excellent example of how a physiological merger of the human body and advanced technology will create a “tipping point” in the future. It is equally likely that some segments of the human population will eschew such augmentation and, like the Amish, live without these modern advances.Read Hamilton’s work to see how he explores the physical and moral implications of biotek. It will answer a lot of your questions.","5,360 followers",Valerio Cietto,677,2.4K,9.1M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-next-big-revolution-in-terms-of-technology-that-is-going-to-blow-our-minds-soon-and-how-may-I-position-myself-to-cash-in-on-it
