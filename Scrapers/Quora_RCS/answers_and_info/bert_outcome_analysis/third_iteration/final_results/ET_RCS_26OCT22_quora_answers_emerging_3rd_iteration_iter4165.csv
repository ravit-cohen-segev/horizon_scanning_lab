As important as Bardeen, Brattain, and Shockley’s invention of the transistor was, its effectiveness was greatly magnified by the invention of the integrated circuit. Jack Kilby of Texas Instruments created a basic prototype in 1958 and eventually was awarded the patent and a Nobel Prize in Physics for his work. Robert Noyce at Fairchild Semiconductor later designed a more pragmatic version of the IC. Many others made significant contributions.Regardless of who gets the lion’s share of the credit, one thing everyone agrees on is the incredible imI am going to expand on Martin Bullen’s answer.

Jack Kilby of Texas Instruments created a basic prototype in 1958 and eventually was awarded the patent and a Nobel Prize in Physics for his work. Robert Noyce at Fairchild Semiconductor later designed a more pragmatic version of the IC. Many others made significant contributions.Regardless of who gets the lion’s share of the credit, one thing everyone agrees on is the incredible impact IC’s have had on our civilization. It isn’t just the capabilities of these amazing devices that have made them important. It’s the stunning exponential increase in those capabilities. Ever since they went into mass manufacturing in the 1960’s, IC’s have doubled in computational power about every 2 years. This growth over the course of half a century is unprecedented in the history of humankind. No other invention has ever doubled it’s power every 2 years for 50 years.IC’s were crucial to the creation of the Internet, itself a game-changing invention. A 10 year old sitting in his bedroom can post content that can be seen across the world within seconds. Even the most powerful people in the world didn’t have that ability 50 years ago.This exponential growth trend is referred to as Moore’s Law after the Intel engineer who was one of the first industry leaders to recognize and popularize it. As Moore himself often pointed out, Moore’s Law isn’t really a law. It’s just a trend that naturally emerged because of the balance between technical capabilities and economic realities. The laws of physics and economics will inevitably put a stop to Moore’s Law. Indeed, the last few years have shown a noticeable deviation from Moore’s Law as transistor dimensions approach the 1 nanometer scale.How will our civilization adjust to the end of Moore’s Law? Will it be a soft landing or a crash landing that takes down governments and industries? Will other technologies such as DNA manipulation or quantum computing step up to take its place? I think it’s very hard to predict what will happen next.One thing I do know is that my generation got a free ride from Moore’s Law like no other generation in history. And what a ride it has been!","6,479 followers",Michael Soareverix,28.3K,373,6.6M,2017,https://www.quora.com/If-you-had-to-guess-what-will-be-the-most-revolutionary-technology-invented-in-your-lifetime

2,"The shift from printed materials to digital ones. It’s had a profound effect on printing, publishing, education, information gathering, and just about anything else where previously we’d need a litho and a lot of dead trees.How good it is - well, that’s another matter. Time was when we’d actually have to get off our fat bottoms and look for stuff in the libraries. Now it’s all readily available with a few key presses and we seem to value it less.

4,I haven't heard of this but I could see the benefits if the person already wears contacts. Some people can't wear them and some people can't get used to the act of putting them in and taking them out. It could be a great thing for some as it would be an early warning sign but diabetic tend to be very aware of when something is not going right with their diabetes. At least the ones I know are. Then how would they see the colour change ? Would it change the overall tint like to red or green or something so they see a difference in the hue of everything?,"115,124 followers",Daveed Phoenix,4.9K,9.9K,160.6M,2019,https://www.quora.com/If-you-had-to-guess-what-will-be-the-most-revolutionary-technology-invented-in-your-lifetime
5,"Question asked:What I think- we will see, that’s what. This is not the first attempt to use tears as a simi noninvasive way to measure blood glucose levels. There was also a wrist unit as well.The problem is that while tears may have glucose in them it lags behind the actual blood glucose levels. This makes it an interesting phenomenon but not as useful and accurate as a finger stick.

This makes it an interesting phenomenon but not as useful and accurate as a finger stick. Constant glucose monitors have a sensor that is inserted under the skin and measure glucose in the interstitial fluids rather than blood. CGMs have a similar problem with lagging actual blood glucose levels as tears, but is much closer to BG if I remember correctly.If I were a type 1 diabetic I would go for the Dexcom G6 CGM and a pump. I wouldn’t mess around with contacts or wrist sensors that cause irritation and are not accurate of real time BG levels.","2,590 followers",Aakash Dhoundiyal,4.7K,99,2M,2019,https://www.quora.com/If-you-had-to-guess-what-will-be-the-most-revolutionary-technology-invented-in-your-lifetime

7,"If a brilliant wizard invented powerful magic items that no one else could reproduce, being allowed to market it or not would depend on what the magic did. Some things like weapons and medical treatments are more restricted than others because of the risk they pose to safety. Needless to say it is impossible for a brilliant scientist to invent revolutionary technology that no one else could reproduce.","3,411 followers",Louis Vaught,4.8K,1.2K,13.5M,2021,https://www.quora.com/If-you-had-to-guess-what-will-be-the-most-revolutionary-technology-invented-in-your-lifetime
