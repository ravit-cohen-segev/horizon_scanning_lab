0,"The reason Karl Marx is still read in most social science and history graduate programs, even with all the errors he did make in formulating his political philosophy, was his recognition that the technology that a society possessed and used was always directly related to the structure of their society at any given time. Perhaps the technology of weapons and other matters related to making war is a partial exception to his conclusions about technology since war making technology is always slightly ahead of every other technology in use at the time.",53 followers,Joyce Chung,999,130,1.1M,2021,https://www.quora.com/How-did-science-and-technology-evolve-during-each-period-in-history
1,"Science is a relatively modern-term, it is only by the 14th century that it meant ‘collective knowledge’. However, in the spirit of the term, for me this artefact shows prehistory astronomy rather well (a science).It is called bird-man, I’m not sure of the actual dating, it is found in Anatolia, not far from Gobekli Tepe (ca. 8000 BCE). It shows the number of days in the year in the background and upon the entwined snakes. To determine this, you need to make repeated solar observations (science) using for example theScience is a relatively modern-term, it is only by the 14th century that it meant ‘collective knowledge’.

Entire belief systems stem from the first device! Scientist have been trying to recreate the same level of cult following since, see the two books on Atlantis (see the works of Plato and Bacon). I have a lot more faith in those that can actually make these things a reality (technology).","46,127 followers",Steven Haddock,6.3K,25.6K,343.5M,2020,https://www.quora.com/How-did-science-and-technology-evolve-during-each-period-in-history

3,"Well, to some extent we already talk to animals - many airports around the world broadcast distress calls of different local bird species to get them to disperse from the runway to avoid being ingested into jet engines.That's pretty much us talking to animals - we're communicating danger.We can also recognise distress calls of animals - most people who work with wild animals regularly can understand animal noises for food and danger.",10 followers,Sajeev Rajan,11.5K,1.5K,46.7M,2014,https://www.quora.com/How-did-science-and-technology-evolve-during-each-period-in-history
4,"There’s the old proposal that if you could ask a gorilla what anatomical advances he’d prefer to make if he could, the answer would be;If you asked a man, the answer would be;The point being: No animal knows how to evolve itself to distinct advantage. Only obvious comparative advantages are valid, and only long after the fact.While it seems obvious to us that a gorilla should desire a larger brain, a throat and jaw adapThere’s the old proposal that if you could ask a gorilla what anatomical advances he’d prefer to make if he could, the answer would be;If you asked a man, the answer would be;The point being: No animal knows how to evolve itself to distinct advantage. Only obvious comparative advantages are valid, and only long after the fact.While it seems obvious to us that a gorilla should desire a larger brain, a throat and jaw adapted for speech and more prehensile hands, while WE know that, the gorilla does not. While we might have a wish list for human adaptations, we really have no idea what changes would be real advantages.",0 followers,Juan Hathaway,9.9K,112,3.7M,2019,https://www.quora.com/How-did-science-and-technology-evolve-during-each-period-in-history
5,"Without, at this time, dangerous genetic manipulation, changes occur very slowly over thousands of years. Possibly with the environmental changes that are happening from human manipulations, people will change a little faster out of necessity, and survival of the fittest.","105,674 followers",Dave Consiglio,544,6.8K,91.6M,2019,https://www.quora.com/How-did-science-and-technology-evolve-during-each-period-in-history
