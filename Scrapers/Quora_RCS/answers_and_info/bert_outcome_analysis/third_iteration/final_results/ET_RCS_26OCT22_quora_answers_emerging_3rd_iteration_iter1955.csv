0,"We could probably send a very compact fully automatic greenhouse as a payload of a future lander.  It would have to be very, very, tiny.  Possibly just a viable seed or two in a growing medium and and inflatable shell.  Just big enough to allow for a plant to begin to germinate.We could probably send a very compact fully automatic greenhouse as a payload of a future lander.  It would have to be very, very, tiny.

1,"About 375 million years ago two fish had a similar conversation, one identifies as conservative and the other progressive, the conservative fish said to the progressive one: “do fish really need to visit land? It’s incredibly dry and barren, there’s nothing there and you can’t breathe for more than 10 seconds or you’ll suffocate to death, what’s the point? We have everything we could ever want here in the ocean. Stop worrying about the future, you need to learn to live in the moment, dude.”The progressive fish didn’t respond, he just smiled and swam away towards the land, never looking back.ThAbout 375 million years ago two fish had a similar conversation, one identifies as conservative and the other progressive, the conservative fish said to the progressive one: “do fish really need to visit land?

2,"No we don't have the ability to create an automated greenhouse on Mars. The rovers are about the largest and most complicated complicated things we can currently manage to send to Mars.It would take considerably more than just a greenhouse to grow food. The Martian soil is most likely to be sterile. It's also very cold and the atmosphere is nothing like ours. Beyond that there are ethical issues about whether we would be polluting Mars with Earth life.Even if we could send a greenhouse, we probably wouldn't.",UNKNOWN,Robert Frost,944,9.4K,195.6M,2015,https://www.quora.com/Do-we-have-the-technology-to-create-an-automated-greenhouse-on-Mars-that-could-grow-and-store-food-for-an-upcoming-manned-mission
3,"No. Absolutely not and anyone who says otherwise doesn’t know what the word technology means and should not be answering questions about space exploration.This is a soapbox I find myself often standing upon, on Quora. There is a general poor understanding of what the word technology means. There is a common misconception that if the scientific principles are understood and there is an ability to make the machines, then the technology is there. That is not what technology means. This is where I must use one of my stamps.There really is no such thing as saying we already have the technology to dNo. Absolutely not and anyone who says otherwise doesn’t know what the word technology means and should not be answering questions about space exploration.This is a soapbox I find myself often standing upon, on Quora.

This is where I must use one of my stamps.There really is no such thing as saying we already have the technology to do something new and complicated in space. The complexity of space missions means they all require technology development. Fifty-four years ago we put humans in low Earth orbit, yet today, companies like SpaceX are developing the technologies needed to do the same. Space is not plug-and-play.Nobody currently has a launch vehicle that can propel a spacecraft large enough to hold humans, all the way to Mars. There are some in development, but the very word development tells us that they are still developing the technology.Nobody has a vehicle that can land humans on Mars. Mars has a very thin atmosphere, which means it doesn’t serve as an efficient braking mechanism as Earth’s atmosphere does. If you followed the various Mars Rover programs, you will remember how they had to do all kinds of crazy things to slow down those rovers before they hit the ground - things like airbags and sky-cranes.Nobody has a habitat that can maintain a crew for the time they would be on Mars.Nobody has a vehicle that can lift humans off of the Martian surface. We haven’t lifted a human off of a celestial body - without a massive rocket - since 1972. There is a lot of technology to develop, there.Nobody has a spacecraft that can hold and care for astronauts for more than two years, without regular resupply from Earth.Nobody has protocols to keep astronauts healthy for missions of that duration. This is one of the key purposes of the ISS - to help us develop that technology.To better understand what the word technology means, see these two posts:What is technology?What are Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs)?",33 followers,Matthew Lee,1.2K,548,11.5M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Do-we-have-the-technology-to-create-an-automated-greenhouse-on-Mars-that-could-grow-and-store-food-for-an-upcoming-manned-mission
4,"I can’t say what’s unknown to who. Gartner has become pretty good at early identification, and much better than they were at timing trends. Because it’s a hyper-competitive marketplace, and innovation is the key to competitive advantage, rocks get overturned quickly.I can’t say what’s unknown to who.

5,"It is hard to know what is well known or otherwise. Here on Quora, it seems that it isn’t yet well known that renewable energy (Solar PV and Onshore Wind) are now the cheapest forms of electricity generation where there is good resources availability. Likewise, most people are unaware of rapid progress in batteries, costs are coming down there as well (expect to see many more electric cars riding off the back of this one). Electricity storage costs aren’t at grid-scale yet, but a lot of progress has been made on grid-scale batteries as well. These factors in combination with the gradual rollouIt is hard to know what is well known or otherwise.

These factors in combination with the gradual rollout of smart grid technology mean that we are looking at a massive overhaul of energy provision in the next decade.Graphene is another big breakthrough which seems to be bubbling away just below the surface, yet to have much of a visible impact, but with the potential for any one of several application areas to be huge.",UNKNOWN,Valerio Cietto,677,2.4K,9.1M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Do-we-have-the-technology-to-create-an-automated-greenhouse-on-Mars-that-could-grow-and-store-food-for-an-upcoming-manned-mission
