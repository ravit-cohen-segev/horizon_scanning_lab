1,That is one of the issues that has yet to be demonstrated practically in the development of fusion power. In theory the energy output in the form of high energy neutrons will be captured to be converted to heat and thence power.This is why generating a self sustaining reaction is not the end of the development process. Going from there to a functioning commercial reactor requires other problems like this to be solved and demonstrated.,"220,634 followers",Franklin Veaux,1.6K,47.3K,783.1M,2019,https://www.quora.com/How-will-we-get-the-thermal-energy-out-of-a-fusion-reactor-without-destroying-the-fusion-process
2,"The energy does not come out directly in thermal form. It comes mainly from very energetic neutrons which leave the actual fusion reaction.

3,"Why is it more daunting to produce energy by nuclear fusion than by nuclear fission?Thank you for the interesting question Oliver.To put it simply, the sustainable fission of certain isotopes, (ie. U235, Pu239, U233) can be done with more attainable conditions than the sustainable fusion of Hydrogen, Deuterium, Tritium, Helium-3, Lithium, Boron, etc.Nuclear fission reactors of many different designs can be built and produce a surplus of energy far beyond the energy required to initiate the chain reaction.

With enriched Uranium, the splitting of nuclei by the correct-energy neutrons, releases energy and more neutrons which in turn split more nuclei.Nuclear fusion requires enormous pressures and temperatures to overcome the repulsion of nuclei, all of which are positively charged. To force the nuclei together, the heat and pressure needed are far greater than any known materials can contain, so the reaction would vaporize its own container. Many ingenious designs using electromagnets and other approaches are being tried, but at this time, all demand more energy than the fusion reaction can produce.","220,634 followers",Franklin Veaux,3.1K,47.3K,783.1M,2021,https://www.quora.com/How-will-we-get-the-thermal-energy-out-of-a-fusion-reactor-without-destroying-the-fusion-process

5,"Put simply it’s because to get fusion to happen you have to work against the tremendous force that causes and releases so much energy in fission.This force is the electrostatic repulsion between protons. In a fissile nucleus you have a large number of like polarity protons crushed extremely close together in a tiny nucleus, repelling each other and so trying to tear apart this nucleus. The strong force “glue” between adjacent pairs of nucleons is only just enough to hold it together. So it doesn’t take much disruption to split such a nucleus, resulting in a lot of that pent up energy in the rePut simply it’s because to get fusion to happen you have to work against the tremendous force that causes and releases so much energy in fission.This force is the electrostatic repulsion between protons.

The strong force “glue” between adjacent pairs of nucleons is only just enough to hold it together. So it doesn’t take much disruption to split such a nucleus, resulting in a lot of that pent up energy in the repulsion between protons being released. This is where all the energy release in nuclear fission comes from. To make things even easier, this disruption is readily available in the form of a speeding neutron which is very conveniently released by a nearby nuclear split, causing a chain reaction. It’s a bomb waiting to happen, just requiring sufficient fissile material to be in one place.But with fusion you have to force a pair of protons together against this tremendous repulsive force between them. It’s only a single pair when you’re fusing helium, but you’re still working against the same repulsive force that yields so much energy in fission. The goal in this case is the large amount of energy released when you finally manage to overcome the proton repulsion and get the four nucleons close enough together for the strong force to take over and glue them together. But the barrier you have to overcome to get there is huge. And there's no chain reaction to help you in this case, it’s all just brute force that’s required.","220,634 followers",Franklin Veaux,1.6K,47.3K,783.1M,1997,https://www.quora.com/How-will-we-get-the-thermal-energy-out-of-a-fusion-reactor-without-destroying-the-fusion-process
6,"First, you need very high temperatures, i.e. you need the hydrogen nuclei to collide at high energy in order to form an He nucleus…they are electrically repulsive until they get very close so the strong, but short range, nuclear force can take over. This means you can’t let the plasma touch any walls of your reactor because the wall will instantly cool the plasma, or the plasma will cut thru the wall. So you have to use magnetic fields to contain the plasma. But the plasma field interaction tends to be unstable.Second, although high temperature is enough to get fusion, it’s not enough to get oFirst, you need very high temperatures, i.e. you need the hydrogen nuclei to collide at high energy in order to form an He nucleus…they are electrically repulsive until they get very close so the strong, but short range, nuclear force can take over.

So you also need high density, which takes high pressure. But you can’t get close to the pressure inside the Sun, and inside the Sun the power density is less than in your body. So a practical power plant needs a power density millions of times higher than in the Sun.","3,658 followers",Brent Oster,3.6K,357,1.8M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Why-is-it-more-daunting-to-produce-energy-by-nuclear-fusion-than-by-nuclear-fission

8,"ITER is still a long way from producing economical power. We can not afford to build enough $10 billion reactors. The ITER is also a very complex reactor and having more money may not improve the rate of construction. The ITER should be ready for testing in 2025. A Chinese research reactor has just recently have produced plasma at twice the heat of the sun for 100 second which is a world record. Beating a recent German reactors record.

THE SILVER MAGNETS ARE POWERED SUPER MAGNETS. MERY EXPENSIVE.A much more effective and timely option could be the development of Next Generation, Generation 4, Fission reactors that will be much easier to build. Gen 4 reactors are less complex. But it is slowed down by testing of materials and equipment. And in some countries, the difficult bureaucratic process is expensive and time-consuming. With more efficient development fission reactors could be developed much faster. As it is being done in China.I think a number of prototypes could be built in 10 years and operational reactors could be in production in factories and shipyards. Most of the research, material, designs and equipment is already available. It would be less complex than the Manhattan project that started from scratch in 5 years. China is about the only country seriously developing Generation 4 reactors.+Generation 4 reactors are designs that are highly resistant to meltdowns even with failure of pumps and power for cooling. Using natural, physical properties There are a number of different types using a variety of coolants and fuels.China has just started operation of an air-cooled reactor using a pebble bed system with fuels in spheres of very heat resistant materials with long lifespans and easy testing and replacement. Natural air circulation can maintain cooling if it is needed. The reactor does not need to be shut down to refuel it.China is also developing a Molten SaltReactor, MSR, and a Travelling Wave reactor. The MSR uses molten salt for cooling, heat transfer and actually contains the nuclear fuel and moves it through a graphite reactor core. The salt can operate at higher temperatures than Pressurised Water Reactors, PWRs, that are currently in common use. The very high temperature, good for industrial uses as well as desalination and production of liquid fuels. At any time the Molten Salt can be removed from the reactor core into a safe holding tank without risk of meltdown. This can be done automatically before any risk of meltdown. It is walkaway safe. These reactors could run on Thorium that is 3 times more common than Uranium. It does not need enrichment and can use up almost all the nuclear fuel, leaving very little waste. Thorium is a byproduct of rare earth mining so it is easily available.The Traveling Wave Reactor, TWR, is self-contained and does not need refueling. It operates over a number of years on depleted Uranium waste which is already available in large amounts as low-grade nuclear waste. The Chinese TWR is based on a US design. It is hoped that this reactor will be very easy to operate and can be used in less developed countries. So it is designed to be simple and very safe to operate. When it eventually runs out of fuel it is replaced and returned to the factory where it is built for storage and recycling.Smaller and modular reactors could be produced more effectively and faster in a factory and transported to site. Able to fit in with existing infrastructure and transported to where it is needed. And used in countries that do not have advanced nuclear industries.Large scale production could be a vital option for low carbon energy and prototypes should be built. If they work as expected they could supply safe, cheap and clean power. With hundreds of years of fuel giving us the time to develop effective fusion energy.","29,974 followers",Tomaž Vargazon,3K,7.7K,249.9M,2019,https://www.quora.com/How-will-we-get-the-thermal-energy-out-of-a-fusion-reactor-without-destroying-the-fusion-process
