(#8)What else you know depends on your profession.If you are a Geologist, you might know what some elements look like in nature.If you are a Miner, you might know how to extract some of them from the earth.If you are a Refining Plant Manager you might know how to refine some of them.If you are a Materials Scientist or Metallurgist you might know how to combine some of them into polymers or alloys.If you are an Engineer you might know how to design parts of a cellphone, but probably only some of the parts.If you are a Mechanist or Factory Worker you might know how to build some of the parts.If you are a Software Engineer you might know how to program some of the electronics.What we are getting at is that there is no such thing as a “Cellphone Maker”.But it gets worse.While the professions listed above know aspects of how to make a cellphone, they also rely on other technology in order to do their jobs.For the Geologist, lets say he really knows his rocks and doesn’t need any fancy electronic testing equipment, which is a good thing, because such equipment is just as complex as a cellphone.But he needs the Miner to dig and get at rocks and oil underground before he can identify them. For this, theSo before we can start making a cell phone, we’re going to need to make an steel pickaxe.How to make an Steel Pickaxe:Oops. We don’t have a pickaxe yet, that’s what we’re trying to make. Now what? How else can we make a pickaxe?How to make a Stone Pickaxe:Oops. We don’t have any rope. Or leather cord. Or anything else to tie with.How to make a Leather Cord:Oops. We need leather first. Where are we going to get leather?How to make Leather:Oops. We don’t have any cows because they haven’t been domesticated yet. We’ll have to make our leather out of something else, such as a deer.How to kill a Deer:Really? A bow and arrow? How do we make that? Better just look for a dead deer lying around somewhere. Oh look there’s one over there. Perfect.How to make Leather From a Deer (Round 2):Just kidding. Don’t have a knife.How to make Leather From a Deer (Round 3):Where do we get salt?

Finally, progress.How to get Salt from the Ocean (Round 2):That took awhile, but now we got the salt. Now back to the leather.How to make Leather From a Deer (Round 4):Lime? As in the fruit?

You mean we can’t use a regular fire? Ahh. Its not hot enough.How to build a Forge:Charcoal?How to make Charcoal:????…As you can see. Even the simplest tasks are not so simple. It seems like technology is progressing really fast today, but that is because of all the technology that literally took ages to figure out.How long would it take to figure out how to do any of the simple technologies above, simply by trial and error? It could take a really long time, for example, to figure out what Iron Ore looks like, and how to build a forge hot enough to melt it. Especially if you didn’t even have any idea that Iron even exists.I mean, come on. Everyone knows rocks don’t melt. If they did, how could we use them to build ovens. Right????So there are a lot of hurdles. But once a technology has been figured out, we can build on it to create the next step.These days, we’ve figured out enough things to do a lot. We’ve also figured out something called science, which is the art of figuring out new things.Tasks that were once really hard, become much easier.

Mostly in the Green Party.

Also most of Europe is airable and thus most of Europe has valuable land which people fought over. Over time they become better and better at war and strategy and develop better weapons. Meanwhile Africa was very very big and much of the land was dessert and not very valuable. Also, the church ideologically wanted to spread Christianity outside of Europe, ironically the parts of Africa that were the most Christian (Ethiopia) managed to almost avoid colonialism until the very end.Ultimately because of geography Africa would not be able to advance past Europe and it would be the Europeans who did the exploring and colonizing.That doesn’t have anything to do with race through.

Instead of taking over and extracting profits for the benefit of shareholders back in Europe, Europeans would have traded with Africans, leaving behind more of the benefits of that trade in Africa, with the added bonus of fewer external disruptions on African politics. This is not to say that Africa was ever a peaceful, idyllic place, but at least conflicts would be based on local factors, not local and colonial ones layered on top of one another.

13,"Interesting question. I will give you my two cents an African.Is Africa poor because of colonization?Simple answer:Long answer:RespeInteresting question. I will give you my two cents an African.Is Africa poor because of colonization?Simple answer:Long answer:Respect and dignity are earnedWhat about if colonization never happened?These what-ifs questions are really pointless in my opinion.Imagine a Rwandan asking:Why are many African countries still lagging behind economically?Colonization was a terrible experience for Africans. No question about it.However, blaming Africa’s problems today solely on colonization is just preposterous. It is a lack of responsibility and accountability on the African’s side.For starters, this is a map of Africa and the European invasion on the continent in the early 20th century. Major colonizers are France, United Kingdom, followed by Spain, Portugal, Italy, Belgium, and Germany.In my opinion, the biggest mistake that Africans made after the so-called “ independence” was to keep Europeans around in their business. They should have cut them off completely, diplomatically and any other bilateral relations they had with Europeans. Till today, that is the African’s problems.The Europeans have never had any interests to develop or to “ civilize” Africans. All they came to Africa to do was for their own self-interests. This is why any African leader who tried to push for the complete independence of Africans was killed and murdered by the Europeans.Didier Champion's answer to Why was Thomas Sankara killed?Africa’s problems todayTill today, many African countries are not really free. They are “misguided” and controlled by Europeans and North Americans for the most part. Who would you blame for this? I blame Africans to allow Europeans to dominate them for another half a century. We have became way too dependent on Europeans. Many of our leaders are absolute shit and quite frankly useless.Africa Intra tradeHome | African UnionThe real reason why Africa still lags behind economically as a continent because:All these things are simple stuff we should be doing to create jobs, collect more taxes, increase GDPs and create independent and free economies. There is no way you can be free when you are still dependent on your former slave masters in the forms of “ peanuts” aid.Change of mentalityIf Africa had gotten rid of Europeans from the 1970’s, countries would have no choice but to trade with one another developing their economies. Instead of exporting their raw materials, they would have developed their industries to export finished products for more money. Instead, the events of imperialism, the cold war gave rise to dictators and all revolutionary leaders in the independence movement were killed one by one in more than 40 African countries.This list can go on and on. You can talk about DRC, Equatorial Guinea, Cameroun, and quite frankly majority of the countries. Again, if Africans had stopped bilateral relations with the West, they would have worked together to develop themselves and their economies through trade, business, innovation and entrepreneurship. The same way that Asian countries such as South Korea, China, and others did it.Look at this map above about Africa’s abundant minerals and other natural resources. There is absolutely no reason why we should have oil refineries in the middle east when we can produce ours right here at home. Are you telling me that all these 10 or so countries cannot get together to create their own industries to make final products? Again, this is Africa’s problems. Not working together and thinking long term.Education, tribalism, and corruptionColonization left Africans feeling inferior to Europeans. After 70–100 years of domination, torture and brutal inhumane acts of violence and genocides, Africans thought that they were not as competitive as the Europeans.They should have set their differences aside and unite one people. As a Rwandan, I say this with absolute shame and disgust. I was born in the middle of a civil war and a brutal genocide broke out when I was barely five. Can I really blame the Belgians and the French on the Rwandan genocide? Yes, partially. But, I would be stupid to not say that Rwandans did the dirty work whatever France did behind the scenes. You see, Rwandan issues in the past and present should be solved by Rwandans themselves and not the Europeans ( Belgium, France, or Germany). To think otherwise is absolute craziness.The tribalism we have today, the identity politics, corruption, and many other issues, Europeans have nothing or little to do with that. These are African issues and can only be solved when we own them, accept them, and be accountable. They might have started during colonization but it is our fault that we still have them today.What should Africa do?All of these are African’s problems and not the Europeans. From the beginning, Europeans never wanted Africans to be “ independent” anyway. They fought hard to keep their stronghold with colonization. When they were forced to give in, they were probably surprised by the free pass they were given.Today, they control Africa through the aid industry and unfair trade practices. By African working together, they would have developed themselves before waiting what the Europeans have to say about them.Do you ever wonder why Africa has absolutely little say about their state of nations? Popular statements such as “Countries who trade with one another tend to be peaceful with one another. After WWII in Europe, Germany and France got friendly not because they liked each other, but because they had mutual benefits exchanging goods and services. If Africa had been trading within themselves, the wars we had in the 1980’s and 90’s, many of them would not have happened.Africa is not really free.Africans are still tied in the colonial chains of their masters in Africa Today.How can Africans be free and independent?Didier Champion's answer to What does Africa need to do to be independent: politically and economically?

Not even Somalia.“We must understand that the time for babysitting is over and that we will never develop as we feel we have a never-ending need for Europeans, Americans, Asians, or other babysitters.”Good leadership matters.Just leaders who care and have the passion for their people.

That’s not correct.To be considered accurate you would plug in the data and it will give you a consistent result that you can correlate to what really happens. What you find is that the models in wide use need a rather large “Correction factor” to get the outcome. Think of adding imaginary money to your book keeping to get a result YOU want to see. What happens is you make decisions on that and it does not work out. There is only one climatology model that does not need major “Correction factor” to match reality. It’s not the one normally used.Of course they know that. The predictions use to come with a time line of when you could expected the prediction to happen. They went from claiming that they knew what would happen in 20 years to 100 years or open ended predictions. Now why would they do that? Maybe because they were unable to make a prediction that became reality.So how do they get away with using inaccurate predictions to influence the public and law makers? Anyone that fails to agree with them can count on getting attacked for doing so publicly. If you are a scientist that relies on public grants for funding you will think twice about publicly disagreeing.Europe was a major grower of wheat at one point since it had the climate to do so at one time, the Arabian peninsula had enough rainfall for trees. A look into tree growth rings, Ice cores and soil layers will give you a history of climate change and it runs from hot to cold.Right now we are exiting a cold period. That is reality.Nice or bad thing about reality depending on how you view it. It is not influenced by someones wants, needs or expectations.It is what it is.I like clean air and water and feel we could do more to get better than what we have. But please skip the junk science while trying to influence me with your views.

Apple does make a significant amount of its own hardware, including processing chips, retina screens, and so forth. These are primarily reconfigurations of existing technologies for streamlined use in Apple products.Apple's true core competency is the ability to foresee the intersection technological advancements and integrate them seamlessly into its products almost instantaneously.One classic example of this is the iPod. The company had a team conduct a formal study of the viability of a portable music device, only to find that the smallest hard-drives available were too large, delicate, and energy intensive to integrate into a portable device. Apple is not in the business of making better hard-drives, it purchases them from scale manufacturers. So they put the project on hiatus.Shortly thereafter, Toshiba started marketing a brand new disk with which met Apple's specifications. Having done its homework, Apple quickly integrated the new hardware into the iPod and rolled out a new product which had deemed impossible only months earlier. They also purchased exclusivity from Toshiba, so that competitors would have to wait for other manufacturers to build similar technology.Roderick is also correct in acknowledging that Apple frequently purchases leading edge technology in the form of acquisitions. One example of this is Apple's purchase of Authentec, which manufactured new type of electro-magnetic fingerprint reader. Apple rapidly integrated this technology into the home button on the iPhone 5s to create the invisible biometric passcode now standard on all models.To a large extent, Apple's only in-house proprietary technology is the user interface that it develops to facilitate the rapid integration of technologies developed elsewhere as they become suitable for the consumer market. As a result, there is a relatively short lead time between when a new feature becomes functional and when consumers first see it.This was demonstrated in Steve Jobs's demo of the first iPhone. Because software features were buggy and unsteady and Apple had not yet finalized the hardware configuration, Jobs had to use multiple devices, each optimized to demonstrate a particular feature. Several rehearsals proved disastrous, and many engineers strongly urged the event be postponed.Since then, best practices in software development have shifted considerably, and Apple frequently deploys early stage versions of new features to early adopters in a beta release to measure their response. So to answer your question, it is probably safe to say that Apple has led the charge in the rapid integration and deployment of even its most cutting edge technology.",652 followers,Al Barleta,3.4K,219,1.8M,2015,https://www.quora.com/How-come-some-humans-kept-primitive-while-others-developed-advanced-technologies-over-time

A better question may be,For me, someone that has worked in all areas of computer technology, at the end of the day, I just want my stuff to work, and I don’t want to have to buy a new computer every couple of years. I do not care about specs, I care about the user experience. For me, it is better that my laptop performs in 2 years the same that it does today, and that O do t have to replace parts very often. In Apple I get that experience.my Android has only received 2 security updates and no OS updates. My iPhone gets a free OS update every year, and frequent security updates.my Windows computers (Dell, HP, Compaq, Toshiba, Asus and IBM) all have suffered mechanical or electrical failures within 2 to 3 years. My last MacBook was 8 years old, and my wife’s was 11 years old… neither had any issues except for the need to replace the battery one time each after about 5 years of use.With a Mac, I get to play in a fully certified Unix shell, that is based on the BSD Unix Mach kernel. On Windows I still use a command line tool based on the MS DOS from 1981. A command line interface barely scratches the abilities of what a Unix system can do.in MacOS, software is more efficient, thanks to a more polished OS and highly optimized frameworks. In Windows everything is bloated, require more resources to do things.with my Windows based computers, if something goes wrong, I have to take the computer to an authorized repair center and wait several days for the fix (if I don’t work on it myself), with Apple hardware, bring it into the Apple store and they address the issue right there while you wait. Only in extreme cases do they keep your computer. I recently had a problem with my USB-C ports. They asked me if I could leave it, when I said I needed it for my work, they told me they would try to reset it, and if that did not work they would replace my Mac so I could leave there with a workin computer. Good luck getting that kind of service in the PC market for a computer that is 9 months old. Oh, and my issue was just a firmware issue that once it got reset was good to go.I used to visit my mother almost Monthly to work on her computer (remove viruses, replace bad hardware, correct a bad update) and she had to buy a new computer every few years. I recommended she get an iMac for her next computer, she has had it since 2011 and I have only worked on it twice — both times just to show her how to run the OS upgrade.People that buy Apple products buy them for the quality and support. And we know the real value is not on dollars saved at time of purchase, but in dollars saved over the life of the computer. We don’t buy anti-virus. Our systems are secure without it. We don’t show off that we have Apple products, only a small number of people think that is cool.Oh, and we don’t play many games on our computers. That is what we buy game consoles for. So we don’t care that the GPU is not good enough for gaming.
