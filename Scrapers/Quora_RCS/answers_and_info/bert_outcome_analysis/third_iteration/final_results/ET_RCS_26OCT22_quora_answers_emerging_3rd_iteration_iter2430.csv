The military had GPS long before it became something that people had in their cars and smartphones. Furthermore, the former head of Lockheed Martin Skunkworks said that they have had technology since the 1970s that people still think is impossible today. This is also true according to my Dad, who was in the Air Force for 22 years and is now an engineering manager at Boeing. Over the course of his career, he has seen so much bleeding edge technology that he can’t even talk about.If you’re talking about more mainstream technology, then usually it’s a mixture of research laboratories at big companies and at research universities. For example, Bell Labs, formerly owned by AT&T was responsible for the point contact transistor, which one a Nobel Prize, in addition to the Bipolar Junction Transistor (the distinction between the two is not incredibly important for this discussion, but they both are grandfather technologies that allowed for the explosion of computing devices). Also from Bell Labs came the Unix Operating System and the C Programming Language. Unix based operating systems are the inspiration for Linux, and Linux runs on everything from your Set Top Box to the world’s fastest supercomputers. The C programming language is 40 years old and still has applications today, especially in the sphere of embedded software development.ARPAnet, the precursor to the internet was developed at the University of California, Los Angeles in accordance with DARPA, under the direction of Professor Leonard Kleinrock who developed the packet switching protocol while he was doing his Ph. D. UCLA has also produced 7 Nobel Laureates, 17 MacArthur Foundation Fellows, and a Turing Award recipient.","1,441 followers",Knowledge Bank,6.7K,117,161.9K,2019,https://www.quora.com/Where-does-the-most-advanced-technology-or-knowledge-come-out-the-university-or-company

Germany is not the most technologically advanced country. It could be pretty close, but there are major elements of society who dedicate themselves to making sure that Germany uses inferior technology that kills more people, damages the environment more, costs more money, and will cause the total collapse of Earth’s biosphere due to a runaway greenhouse effect. Mostly in the Green Party.

For example at the siege of Neuss Charles the Bold had plenty of artillery (several hundred pieces) and they were used to bombard the camp of the relieving army.Below are some sections from…Other than that the Wars of the Roses included a small number of artillery although not always deployed to the best effect.The early 16th century would likewise see quite some artillery fielded. TheIt should be said that towards the end of the 15th and beginning of the 16th century there was a move towards fewer and more powerful cannons and as such it seems the total number of artillery dropped considerably.I have to admit that between the middle of the Italian Wars and the beginning of the Dutch revolt there’s something of a gap in my knowledge of wars. It might well be that the conflict between those two points involved fewer cannons, the French wars of Religion almost certainly did.The almost mythical (re)invention of light field artillery gets attributed to basically any commander who operated in the late 16th and early 17th century. Being the chauvinist that I am I might as well credit Maurice of Nassau with it. He introduced light 3, 6 and 12 pdr guns with the 3 pdr weighing only 300 lbs which meant they could be manhandled easily.A field army of 1622 counted 15 infantry regiments and 6x 12-pdrs, 18x 24- pdrs and 50x small drakes. This preponderance of 24-pdrs and small drakes continued throughout this period, the former often with equal numbers of traditional and short-barrelled pieces (24-pdr drakes). - Dutch Armies of the 80 years war Bouko de GrootIn sum artillery did get used throughout the period but there might have been a reduction in the overal number during parts of the 16th century when fast campaigns without sieges were fought.",256 followers,Priyal Gupta,9.7K,0,0,2020,https://www.quora.com/Where-does-the-most-advanced-technology-or-knowledge-come-out-the-university-or-company
25,"What’s interesting about this is that Leonardo Da Vinci had ideas for many of the mechanical technologies that were developed in the 20th century, in the 15th century (late 1400s), but he was unable to successfully make any of them.

The Industrial Revolution wouldn’t happen for another 300 years.How society comes to support the development of knowledge is complex. It’s not a straightforward matter, because that effort occurs in a social, I’d almost say anthropological context. I feel I can roughly say that the conditions in society need to be right before it can happen, but I’m not clear on what those conditions are. I can say that comfort with exploration and experimentation needs to exist, where people are not averse to taking risks, financial and otherwise, for the sake of gaining new knowledge.A point Richard Feynman made is that you also need a system of wealth accumulation; an economy, and a financial system. For that, you need some system of property rights, which had to be invented.The very notion of invention had to be invented, as well.For a more detailed history on this, I’ve thought James Burke did a great job creating an engaging, and fascinating history of how scientific and engineering knowledge developed in the West, in two series he created,There were many important points he made in these series, but some of them were that the critical inventions and knowledge that were developed came about because of other knowledge that came before them; that certain historical, philosophical, and social events contributed to the fostering of those inventions and ideas; and how that knowledge changed how people thought about, and perceived the world. It changed people’s thinking about what could be made, and why they’d want to make it, as well.Another good source on this is the book,","5,360 followers",Valerio Cietto,677,2.4K,9.1M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Where-does-the-most-advanced-technology-or-knowledge-come-out-the-university-or-company
