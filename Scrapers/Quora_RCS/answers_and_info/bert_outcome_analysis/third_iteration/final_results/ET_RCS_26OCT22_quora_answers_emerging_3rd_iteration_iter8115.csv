That means in the worst case it is the last element of the list you have to check allIf you have a Dictionary<string, Transform> where the key is the name, you don't need to search at all. You can just access it directly with the [ ] notation.This isn't searching, it's just like you knew it was index 348 in a giant list. You only need to access 1 element.(This is O(1) in big O notation, the most efficient possible)Before you ask, yes of course there's a trade off for the efficiency of indexing your data structure this way. Dictionaries uses a little more memory than a List, but it's not a significant enough difference to matter in the vast majority of cases considering what you gain in return. You can still iterate over the Values as an IEnumerable as well if necessary which is very convenient. (You know, like foreach.)So what's a real world example of how I’d use one in practice?Let's say I've written a bunch of different behaviors for enemies, that are all subclasses of a class named EnemyBehaviour… and I want to configure which behaviors the different enemies get from a .csv (comma spaced variable) data file.I can make aand then I can make my behaviors register their constructors in the dictionary like this.Then when the enemy is configuring itself it can get a new instance of the behavior from the string it parsed out of the data file.Of course, if you don't know about Dictionaries then you probably don't know about delegates or lambda expressions either, but I can't cover everything.",709 followers,William Ting,11.1K,70,2M,2017,https://www.quora.com/When-I-play-a-video-game-like-WOW-or-Starcraft-my-laptop-starts-to-heat-up-Is-that-harmful-for-my-laptop

I initially learned C in 7th grade summer, because my Dad was a vetran at C (working on low level things for the past 10 years) and he told me that It would give me a strong understanding of programming in general. Within 2 months I gave up.3 years passed from that day, and I took on C  once again 9th -10th grade summer. This time however, I took a different approach at the language. Rather than focusing on reading from books and trying to get the concepts, I just head on tackled the language with projects. I started off building simple things like Tic Tac Toe and few other quirky things. Then I took the same projects and tried to dig even deeper, I started using pointers, and I immesred myself in a whole new world of C. By the end of summer I got a fairly decent grasp of C, I was doing hackerrank challenges fairly well, building more advanced command line tools and I felt that I had achieved my goal.School started, and my interests started shifting, once again. I took a strong interest in iOS development, and I felt my decent understanding in a procedural language would help me in iOS development..And it did. I heard of people taking month long courses in order to develop a basic application, I managed to do the same within 2 weeks. I realized that a lot of what I learned in C, could be applied almost everywhere. Of course, getting used to an Object Oriented Language did take a bit of time, but none the less, I started getting a decent grasp of Objective-C. And then I jumped again.This time I got to node.js, because I wanted to build my own backends for my own applications. Suprisingly, the language felt so familiar to C, and I go the hang of it really quickly. It felt right at home and in a relatively short amount of time, I achieved what I wanted.I can keep going on and on. The point is I jumped everywhere from C to objective-C, to javascript to swift and then back to javascript and C, and python and ton of other stuff. Within a few months you will begin to realize that all languages are just tools. Tools, that will help you build anything you imagine. Some langauges are better than others when it comes to doing certain things, but most of the time, the topics you learn and understand stay with you forever, regardless of what language you are using. The reason why C is both a great and terrible place to start, is because it is a bit more complex than other languages, and has a steeper learning curve. However, if you stick with it, and don't give up like I did initailly (man do I wish I hadn't given up and let 2 yearsish go to waste), the rewards are tremendous. C being a very picky language, you are forced to develop good programming practices, and in the process of figuring out annoying errors, you will also get a strong understanding of many concepts. Combine that with some Object Oriented understanding, and you can do pretty much everything. I am not saying that you can't get the same understanding with other languages, but from my experience, no language is as strict as C, so its likely that you won't deal with many of the problems that you come by in C, and thus won't learn about some valuable concepts. Not knowing them, will definately huant you in the future, when you are doing much longer and complex projects.Sorry for the long rant, but hopefully that kinda helped. Just remember its the concepts, not the language. Just take small projects, or start doing exercises likeIf you found this answer helpeful, I would really appreciate an up vote.

Biology did not evolve literal wires and circuits to move electrons around (I’m not going to say itBut we aren't THAT fast. The processing speed of the brain is generally limited by things like the diffusion of molecules across (very tiny) spaces, and in some cases intracellular molecular signaling cascades and changes in gene expression (which take seconds, minutes or hours—insanely slow compared to how fast a computer can process an input and store something in permanent memory).So brains are slow compared to computers.Brains are incredibly space and energy efficientBrains still can do things that supercomputers can't do-and brains are way smaller and run off of a cheeseburger. Have you seen a picture of IBM Watson? Do you know how much power it takes? Humans gave Watson a real run for its money before it eventually creamed us in Jeopardy. But IBM Watson fills a room, and the human brain is just a few pounds. Just think about that.It's not clear if the human brain has a hardware advantage or a software (algorithms) advantage, but it’s probably an algorithms advantage. Modern super computers have 150 trillion transistors. The human brain has 100 trillion synapses. The human brain runs on about 12 watts of power. IBM Watson runs on 750,000 watts. And they are approximately equally good at Jeopardy. Think aboutYou can’t power the same number of processing units on 4 orders of magnitude less power unless you are doing something seriously different.Brains are not slow computers. Brains just work completely differently.That brings us back to parallelism.Brains process huge amounts of information and all of it is happening in parallel. And the power of that distributed processing architecture is only just starting to be understood. For decades brains justBut something “magical” (i.e., we don’t understand how it works…) starts happening when you start exploring highly parallel (and recurrent) processing architectures that are more similar to the anatomy of the brain and less like traditional computers. This is what is driving the explosion of deep learning and neural networks applications in the last 10 years (really the last 5 years) in computer science. Again, this is exciting and new because generally computers don’t work this way. In fact, computers still don’t work this way—we simulate these architectures in software (which is extremely expensive from an energy perspective).The downside of this is that we still don’t really understand how brains (or high performing artificial neural networks) actually work. We can describe the parallelism and characterize how the system behaves, but we can’t build it from scratch. The most advanced artificial intelligence systems using deep neural nets have to teach themselves. We’ve designed the algorithms that “train” these systems, but we can’t actually build the system ourselves.“Can the brain understand the brain?”Thus ponderedWe generally understand how computers work, and we can build them.We do not understand how brains work, and we cannot build them.

At that time, there were many pro-American factions within the CCP, not only within the Party but also quite a few intellectuals outside the Party who supported the United States.If Obama is given another eight years, it is really possible that China will be exterminated by the United States. This practice is very clever. The United States did not invade China, but the United States keeps exporting values to China, which will constantly subvert the Chinese people's views on the Communist Party and the Chinese government. Similar to the color revolution.In China, the pro-American faction has a special name called ""public intellectuals""（公知）, which is a neutral word in itself, but many pro-American people call themselves ""public intellectuals"", and now this group is almost equal to the treason group in China. At first, it was regarded as the light of civilization, but now it is regarded as a traitor to treason.But don't underestimate the pro-Americans. Many of them are rich, hold important positions in China, and have contacts with the United States. They are really likely to subvert the country. After Trump took office, Trump's successive trade wars and scientific and technological wars against China strengthened the Chinese Communist Party's determination to resist the United States and strengthened the Chinese people's determination. The former pro-Americans have become people abandoned by the times.* Trump forced China to embark on the road of further industrial localizationOnce China didn't have many high-tech products, so it could only complete basic assembly. With the development of China, China has continuously increased the research and development of high-tech products. But Trump sees the danger that China may bring. Therefore, various restrictions and attacks were imposed on Chinese enterprises. Trade war and science and technology war started three years ago.If it weren't for Trump's fierce offensive, Chinese enterprises would still have illusions about the US government. It is precise because of the various unequal treaties listed by Trump that Chinese enterprises have further realized the ideas of the US government. Now all Chinese enterprises regard the core technology as their life and are determined to overcome it. The idea of Chinese enterprises has been supported by the CPC and the Chinese people. It is very difficult to tackle technical problems, but abandoning fantasy to tackle technical problems will surely succeed one day.* Trump and Pompeo constantly confronted China on Hong Kong and Taiwan issues, which accelerated China's management of Hong Kong and now accelerated the process of China's unification of Taiwan by force.Former American politicians are very talented people.First of all, they know that Hong Kong and Taiwan issues are the core issues of China, and secondly, they know that Hong Kong and Taiwan issues can become a bargaining chip against China when necessary.China also knows what the US government thinks.Therefore, instead of taking over Hong Kong substantively, the CCP has given Hong Kong a high degree of autonomy. This is because the United States does not confront China on the Hong Kong issue. Before Trump took office, the CCP did not accelerate the deterioration of the Taiwan issue. On the contrary, before that, the CCP was vigorously promoting cross-strait exchanges. As the United States, they admit the fact of one China, but they have a vague attitude on the issues of Hong Kong and Taiwan in private. This practice is used to check and balance China.The American model once made it very difficult for China. On the one hand, the Chinese government cannot completely realize reunification. On other hand, patience is the only way to exchange for friendly relations between China and the United States. Only China-US friendship can promote China's construction and development. The United States is also very smart. On the one hand, it uses Hong Kong and Taiwan to check and balance China; on the other hand, its friendly relationship with China can also benefit the United States.But Trump broke the balance when he came to power. Trump underestimated the CCP's bottom line on Hong Kong and Taiwan issues. Trump believes that as long as China is completely suppressed, China will definitely bow its head. If Trump doesn't do this, maybe China will really bow its head.It's like if you want to kill 10 people, the best way is to threaten them with guns and say, ""You kill each other, and the last one who survives will not be killed"". At this time, these ten people will kill each other. If you point a gun at 10 people and say, ""I will kill you."" The final result may be 10 people pouncing on you and killing you.China is a nation with strong patience. As long as the Chinese can live, they will not riot easily. But if the Chinese can't stand it, there will be an uncontrollable counterattack.After Trump broke this tacit understanding and consensus. China can't endure any longer.First of all, China promulgated the National Security Law in Hong Kong. Now Hong Kong is an isolated island. All those who tried to make Hong Kong independent were all trapped in Hong Kong. Because Hong Kong is surrounded by Chinese territory, airspace, and territorial waters.

As the negative views of China continue to grow in US, it looks like (a) is inevitable. With a cold war type of relationship, it unfortunately becomes a zero-sum game. In that case, I believe China would rather pay the short terms price in exchange for long terms success. The following are my reasons why China favors 4 more years of Donald Trump:(1) Republicans vs. Democrats(2) Transactional vs. Ideological BasePeople may disagree with my arguments by pointing out that Trump actually imposes tough sanctions against China high tech companies like Huawei and SMIC. That is the the same contraction when he favors relationship with Putin while impose tough sanctions on Russia. My opinion is that there are China hawks in Trump’s administration like Wilbur Ross, John Bolton or Peter Navarro believe in tech cold war to contain China. Trump is taking advantage of those sanctions as bargaining chips. A good example is Trump commented that he could intervene in the arrest of Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou if it helps the trade deal negotiation. He does not care that implies US is holding hostage for ransom money! To Trump, he does not think of moral principles much. If a deal is good enough, he can let go those sanctions.(3) Trump’s Pacifism(4) Damage to Global Alliance RelationshipsThe hardline former Trump’s National Security Adviser, John Bolton, recently said in an interview that he is not going to vote for Trump. I am not a fan of Bolton, but he said 4 more years of Trump will do so much more damage to US alliance relationship to the point of irreversible.(5) Leaving Multi-Lateral organizationsTrump withdraw from TPP (Trans-Pacific Partnership) which is a free-trade zone that specifically excludes China. Trump does not believe in free trade and he probably does not understand Obama’s China containment strategy either. Then he withdraws from WHO in the middle of pandemic crisis which makes no sense to anyone. The withdraw from Paris accord makes China becoming the climate change leader. He actively undermines WTO, NATO and UN to the point that US is consistently out voted on issues related to China. Trump’s actively leaving or undermining multi-lateral organizations is becoming a perfect gift to China.Conclusions",0 followers,Samuel Billings,9.1K,1.7K,2.2M,2020,https://www.quora.com/When-I-play-a-video-game-like-WOW-or-Starcraft-my-laptop-starts-to-heat-up-Is-that-harmful-for-my-laptop

Trump has not done such friendly measures with China and has used a blunt tariff strategy in opposition with China. This was countered with a well placed tit-for-tat strategy by China targeting Trump’s voting base.His policies have appeared to be erratic and unreasonable towards China by other G8 countries, as evidenced by an overall European sympathy for China’s stable, rational foreign policy measures and economic partnerships. European response overall has been towards common strategic alignment on policy regarding China, without sidetracking either the US or China, as well as hoping US-China tensions do not increase.Although Biden’s political campaign has focused on being as tough or tougher on China, his prior track record during his time as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and leading Senate’s efforts to have China join the World Trade Organization would suggest this as a 180 degrees departure from his previous history (not that Trump hasn’t done 180 degrees departures before - he used to be a Democrat). I will not debate whether Biden will keep his campaign promises or not.

We outsource a good chunk of our labor to China, but a lot of the goods they were buying from us can be imported from other countries without the tariffs. Trump’s administration is filled with incompetent sycophants, President Xi’s government may be ruthless, but far from incompetent. They knew exactly what retaliatory tariffs would hurt Trump’s voters the most, so they went after the agricultural industry. Farmers lost their soybean market and their other commodity exports are down 40%. Even if a trade deal was reached, China wouldn’t go back to buying US goods at the same volume as before the trade war. Trump has to worry about reelection, among other things, President Xi doesn’t. It’s unusual for a GOP administration to oppose free trade, but like I said before, Trump is an idiot. China can wait this out until a mentally stable president represents the US, which shouldn’t be too far away, but the damage caused by Trump’s trade war may be permanent for farmers.Imagine growing up on a farm that’s been in your family for generations. Imagine working on that farm since you were a kid and continuing to work on it as an adult knowing that as long as the weather doesn’t get too bad, your hard work will be rewarded come harvest time. Then imagine Trump starting a trade war with our biggest trading partner and because of retaliatory tariffs, it would cost Chinese importers 15–25% more to buy your goods. You can lower your prices and say goodbye to most of your profits or have no market to sell your goods to. Chinese importers don’t really care if they get their soybeans from you or Brazil or Russia, they’ll go wherever they can get a better deal for the same quality product. Now imagine the money from the subsidies is running out because you used it to maintain your farm, the bills are piling up, and you have no other source of income. Eventually you may have to sell the farm that your grandparents used to work on because Trump is an idiot.

It’s more of an ignorantly misguided confidence, mixed with a totally deluded sense of grandiosity.He has an uncanny ghoulish way of getting away with things he knows very little about, (and that’s pretty much everything). It is not so much that he backs himself to outsmart his challenges, (obviously he’s incapable of doing that)… it’s more that he considers himself to be above even having to be answerable in the first place.(Edit: Somebody in the comments said, Despite who’s inside, Trump has the weird ability to suck the intelligence out of a room… lol... too funny… but funny as it is, unbelievably, it does seem to be exactly what happens.)He takes no responsibility for anything whatsoever…And when even slightly challenged, he will attack like a spoilt little baby, and will blame anybody and everybody in sight. He does this literally by name calling, and lying through the skin of his teeth.This tact is so outrageous, so preposterous… it’s simply astounding he gets away with it. But what’s even more ridiculous, is he actually believes this childish strategy to be something genius.In reality all he really does is make a fool of himself and a mockery of his own “undeserved” privilege.Unfortunately and rather bizarrely it seems, at least 40% of Americans were either fooled by his narcissistic bravado, or are themselves actual morons.I’m sorry… but from an internationally civilized perspective, this is truly shocking! It reflects something about the good old US of A, that the remaining 60% of Americans find rather, well… embarrassing.Actually to be perfectly fair, Mr Trump’s true clown trousers weren’t totally axiomatic till later on in his term. I mean nobody ever expected the levels of idiocy he is reaching on a daily basis right now. Nobody…Even those of us who were shocked from the beginning, are surprised by just how absurdly idiotic he is proving to be.I mean come on… the man is a total doucheburger.He’s* obtusely offensive,Hell… he doesn’t even read his briefs for goodness sake. What kind of president doesn’t freaking read?President Trump often struggles to focus during his intelligence briefings, and frequently ignores information he disagrees with.You can’t correct him (let alone reason with him) because he thinks he knows more about everything than anybody else, including experts on all manner of topics.Trump always thinks he’s the smartest person in the room. What a freaking joke… Only in his big bloated orange egomaniac head.He can barely string enough words together to form coherent sentences, and they’re often just flippant remarks based on petty nonsense.He says the most ludicrous things (as if they are supposed to mean something), despite being nothing but scatterbrained trumpery (pun intended). How he can not see how stupid he looks is just plain cringe worthy.He’s a freaking comedy show! That’s what he actually is. He’s damned entertaining… but “sorry mate”, we are laughing at you, and your weird whiny querulous lies, not with you.We don’t think you’re clever funny, we think you’re dumb-ass funny.Alarmingly…the comedy Trump provides for us, overshadows the increasing seriousness of the real danger he incites.The level of “crazy” that Trump gets away with is disturbingly shameful…I’d even be bold enough (and I’m not the only one I’m sure) to say,it’s a national disgrace.I’m not going to get into the nitty-gritty of all that right now, but it’s concerning to say the least.

29,"The Michelson-Morley experiment in 1887 showed that light has the same speed regardless of your reference frame. So if you observe a light wave from your couch or from an airplane or from a spaceship, it will always be traveling at the same speed relative to you. This result was counter-intuitive, since according to Newtonian physics, the speed you are moving at should impact the observed velocity of what you are observing, eg your tv might appear stationary from your couch, but to someone traveling 300 mph in a plane above, the tv looks like it's moving backward at 300 mph.The only consistentThe Michelson-Morley experiment in 1887 showed that light has the same speed regardless of your reference frame.

So it's not that we know for sure that nothing can travel faster than light, it's that the best theory we have for predicting physical behavior at high speeds yields results that are very difficult to interpret at speeds above c, and that no one has yet observed any object moving faster than c.

Note : Zero is common suffix for initial values. m0 does not mean the ball has zero mass.)First we need to understand that if an object weighs 1 kg when lying on a table. It wouldn't weigh exactly the same when it is moving - it would be heavier than that. For our everyday scenarios, the change is so slight that we can't notice (unless we have a weighing machine that measures to so many decimal places that we can see the change in weight)So for a body moving with velocity u, the mass is not the m0 butwhere u = velocity of objectwhere u = velocity of objectNow, How do I make things go faster than light and settle the argument that indeed going faster that light isn't that 'big a deal'?As You can see in the above formula velocity of object (u) approaches speed of light (c). It's mass approaches infinite (because u =c so denominator = zero).So as objects velocity increases it requires more and more force to make it go faster because mass increases and Force required = mass * acceleration (the same way you can easily push a cycle to move it but try to do that with a truck! It would barely move.)So this where we are stuck, we are not able to push objects to higher speed beyond a point. So far Large Hadron collider has achieved particles going at about 0.999999991Okay. So we are not there yet. Sigh!Now, What If somehow velocity of object exceeds speed of light (dream scenario).So far we have not found objects with imaginary mass (if equation applies in that context) nor have we been able to propel objects to equal speed of light and Einstein's theoretical equations are proving accurate for experiments carried out. Hence, we are assuming no object can travel at speed of light. :)But don't worry, if sound barrier was broken with change in design of aircrafts, Light barrier would also be broken someday.

What is a wave that does not oscillate in time? This made no sense to him. He then wondered how he would perceive a clock if he were travelling with light’s speed. Since the light from clock would never catch up with him (him travelling with the same speed) he realized that time on the clock would appear stopped: the clock would always show the same time.

The rules are thus: Each duelist will board his or her superadvanced spaceship and, on the count of three, accelerate away from each other for ten seconds. They will then turn (without stopping, that's an important technicality), and fire their tachyon pistols at each other.Alice, filled to the brim with loathing for Bob, boards her spaceship and waits for the count. One … two … three and she's off at some substantial fraction of speed of light. She counts down ten seconds, turns and fires at Bob.But since Bob and Alice have been receding from each other at high speed, Bob is time dilated in Alice's frame of reference. So when her clock says ten seconds have elapsed, only five seconds have elapsed for Bob. When she fires her magic instantaneous tachyon pistol, it hits Bob's spaceship when his clock reads five seconds.Enraged that Alice fired early, Bob turns and shoots right back at her. But since they've been receding from each other at high speed, Alice is time-dilated in Bob's frame. So when he fires at the instant his clock reads five seconds, only two and a half seconds have elapsed for Alice. Bob's aim is better than Alice's, so his shot hits her spaceship and kills her … seven-and-a-half seconds before she fired the shot that caused Bob to shoot her back.Faster-than-light anything and causality cannot coexist.Now the thing is, you’ll recall at the beginning of this answer I was specific aboutIn 1935 Einstein published a paper in collaboration with Podolsky and Rosen (the famous EPR paper), which at the time they thought was a nail in a coffin for quantum mechanics.
