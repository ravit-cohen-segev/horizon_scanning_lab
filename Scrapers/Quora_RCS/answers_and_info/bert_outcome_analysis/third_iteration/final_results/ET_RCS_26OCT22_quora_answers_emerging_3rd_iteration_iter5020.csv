Japanese and Korean actually do. Just imagine translating babies’ talks.Those languages don’t show much information spoken or written. They just let everything in the context. Who does what to whom?

6,"Think about it from the perspective of the mechanization of agriculture in the late 19th/early 20th century: is today’s low-skilled worker more like the farm laborer who migrated to a higher-productivity job in the city, or the horse he worked beside, whose job was permanently eliminated by machines?I take an optimistic view of human potential, but enabling this path will require much more productive K12 education, plus a commitment to lifelong learning.

If you able to take the software that first beat a chess master in 1981 and run it on modern hardware (1000’s of times faster) OR you could run modern algorithms on that 1981 hardware…which do you think would do better.If you guessed the modern software in the old hardware you would be correct. Software in modern devices has the advantage that it can be updated (often wirelessly).When you combine hardware speed, cost and availability of sensors and increased capability of software and project those curves forward they make the 1903 Flight of the Kittyhawk to the 1978 first flight of a 747 look ponderously slow (a 747 is only about 20x faster than kittyhawk, the chip in any new cellphone is 1,000s of times faster than any 20 year old processor, takes less energy, has 100’s of times more cache, has embedded graphics and costs less….it’s like going from the kittyhawk to a supersonic jet that costs $10).The first industrial revolution (steam) happened over a span 70–90 years, the second over 40–50 years. We’re going to see things change more in the next 20, probably in the next 10.That speed is the problem.So…it’s not the replacement of human labor per se. It’s the speed that we will (looking at the advancements of the component technologies) replace those jobs.Self driving cars have been on public roads for 6 years, within the next 5 they’ll likely begin driving without humans.

9,"No; in this sort of debate, both sides usually have a point but miss the big picture. And they certainly never hear each other.AI has already destroyed jobs. A lot of jobs.

But the curious feature of past technological revolutions is that they stubbornly refused to destroy the employment rate.In the Agricultural Revolution, we got rid of a staggering number of farmers; farming used to be the bulk of the labor market, and then suddenly it was a small percentage.

In the Industrial Revolution, people initially moved to factories, but later they also moved to academic and office jobs thanks to the GI Bill.

THEY are, in fact, talking about you and backstabbing you right now.You realize that all the dollars you spent on degrees to get you a job that will make you happy were completely wasted. You were scammed but you can't let the next generation know so now you become part of perpetuating the scam.A trillion dollar marketing campaign forced you to buy a house you didn't really want and now you will ""lose a house"" you never really owned if you don't bow down to the Masters every day.
