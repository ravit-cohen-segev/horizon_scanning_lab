Some of the water does return to the underground aquifers - but not all of it.Thus deserts grow… and there is less water available for drinking - as it has ended up in the oceans.","68,773 followers",Kanthaswamy Balasubramaniam,898,17.3K,413.3M,2021,https://www.quora.com/How-can-advanced-technologies-prevent-consecutive-subsidence-due-to-over-abstraction-of-groundwater-Please-help-with-your-answers-Thank-you
1,"There are dozens of extractive and process industries that have been contaminating groundwater for decades. Agriculture is one of the worst, and arsenic from the days of DDT pesticides is still working its way into groundwater.And, in areas of large tradition oil production where wells have been abandoned decades ago, forgotten, and the casings have eroded away, there is some nasty contamination going onFracking does not contaminate groundwater.This is one more myth created by activists to generate donations from misinformed activists.There are dozens of extractive and process industries that have been contaminating groundwater for decades.

The water we’ve been working a long time to purify is the water that’s been coming out of oil wells during, and after their useful life.It is true that we are facing a water crisis globally, due to over withdrawal of groundwater for agriculture, but since withdrawing groundwater leads to profitability, we do not hear the real global issues about groundwater.But, it has little or no relativity to “fracking.”","5,990 followers",Jens Böttiger,566,2.6K,17.6M,2020,https://www.quora.com/How-can-advanced-technologies-prevent-consecutive-subsidence-due-to-over-abstraction-of-groundwater-Please-help-with-your-answers-Thank-you

But, I think I can boil it down to one factor:Distance vs. habitabilityThe Moon is close. That’s nice, because it makes shipping stuff from Earth way cheaper.Mars is far more habitable.

That’s the $64 trillion question.I suspect living on the Moon will be cheaper at first, simply because the cost of launches to Mars are exorbitant. But once a Mars base is set up, living there will be cheaper long term. Why?1.

5,"I'm sure some people with real expertise will provide answers with some depth. I'm not one of them. But here is what I would offer based on some of my biology education: Mars is not a viable habitat for humans.Humans have been able to live, adapt, and thrive on much of the Earth. But if you think about it, all living things have suitable habitats. You don't see polar bears in jungles, and you don't see palm trees in the Arctic. Humans are clever and have technology, but surviving on Mars for any length of time, while possible, would be a Herculean task.","29,923 followers",Tomaž Vargazon,963,7.7K,249.7M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-if-the-Asgardians-Marvel-were-no-long-living-mortals-with-advanced-technology-but-really-immortal-gods
6,"China typically blows every other country out of the water with solar and wind installations.Last year, China installed more solar than the US has in total. While in the US, Republicans seem to think that the US shouldn’t bother addressing MMCC, or that it’s somehow unfair for us to be burdened- because China and India pollute so much. That seems to be the US President’s incredibly assbackwards position. Not surprisingly.So here’s yet another high tech field where the US gave up it’s mastery of the land. We ceded it to China because of one very stupid man.

10,"As a rule, anything officially (even unofficially) released to the public has already been replaced. So anytime a new weapon comes out with a new tech or weapon, i just assume they have something more badass being built in secret. That rail-cannon the officially unveiled in 2016? We’ve known about it for years. What qe didn't know was they were workingon Directed Energy weapons as well. Heard rumors, but no videos or anything. Once they officially announced the railgun, suddenly there were directed energy weapons videos on the net.","105,664 followers",Dave Consiglio,4.5K,6.8K,91.6M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-if-the-Asgardians-Marvel-were-no-long-living-mortals-with-advanced-technology-but-really-immortal-gods
11,"Yep, there’s loads of high tech- stuff going on we don’t know about. Assuming, as I believe we did, we really did put men on the moon around 50 years ago, our technology now is going to be incredible.

There is stuff that really would “blow our minds.” I’m sure science fiction is now science fact, in many cases.When president Trump talks of what the US could do militarily to N.Korea, he knows that any “war” would be won with overwhelming US technology. Trump himself is not going to know about every single development & project the US has. How could one man take it all in? But he’ll know about a lot of things that we don’t.My “uncle” Ted, (close family friend) worked on the design of missile guidance systems for the Canadian Navy. I nearly moved to Nova Scotia with him to do engineering there. Ted told me decades ago that the military had far more advanced stuff than the public had, & that it might take 20 or more years for the technology to filter down to things the public might use.I follow civil & general engineering closely. What’s now possible with that is mind boggling. With enough money, there isn’t much that can’t be done. Underground “cities” linked by high speed maglev trains, for example.— It’s all do-able. Maybe there is an underground system to whisk the president & VIP’s quickly out of harm’s way if there was an attack. Sounds a good idea to me.Even as far back as WW2 ,there were rumours the Germans were working on anti- gravity flying machines. Some people even believe there have been alien craft land on earth, such as the Roswell incident. There are theories that the US military have reverse engineered them & test secret craft at Area 51. Who knows?Laser & directed energy weapons exist. Google : CHAMP high powered microwave weapons too. They could be able to destroy much of the electronics on the battlefield.

Now, how advanced?
