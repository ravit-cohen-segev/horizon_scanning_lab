0,yes by five to ten years it will seem to do things like work with a wider intelligence. Tesla is the closest I think in this regard. This will give it more prominence in our systems and mindsets. Hollywood situations are unlikely but a rouge AI evolving could cause weird things to happen. Technology by design is learning to think not to have deep emotional responses like wanting to overrule humanity. Though deep thought though weird things could happen. Also technology already does overrule people in many cases and the whole system needs to become more human friendly and ethically routed.,"5,084 followers",Bobby Tatro,3.9K,2.2K,45.6M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Will-technology-overrule-in-the-next-few-years

These are powerful armours that can give people additional strength to jump, run or lift heavy weights. And it is not just Iron man who can now do these things. Scientists have been able to invent such exoskeletons already, which can now be made available to general public, very soon. This is surely one of the most popular among additions to the 10 future technologies that already exist.3).Hover CarsHover cars have always been considered too futuristic. People believe that it’s impossible to have cars that can fly and we are happy with thinking of them as part of movies or documentaries. However, this is one of the 10 future technologies that already exist. Israeli scientists have been able to create unmanned battle vehicles for army evacuations.4)CloakingThe idea of invisibility is fascinating. As kids, we all wanted to imagine how it would feel to be invisible. However, we still thought it’s just restricted to realm of imagination. This is another one of the 10 future technologies that already exist. Cloaking devices are already a reality. Scientists in UK have been able to make a paper clip invisible by use of meta materials. This is another addition to the 10 future technologies that already exist.5).Hologram TVsThis would be one of the finest inventions till date.We are all amazed by hologram TVs that we see in Hollywood movies. We look at them in wonder and believe that they are something our grandchildren will enjoy. However, we need not despair. This is one of the 10 future technologies that already exist. Prototypes have already been made and the Japanese broadcaster will have a fully functional version out in 2017.6).Wireless PowerWe are all fed up with devices that need to be constantly charged with a real charger that we need to carry around. The inconvenience of this necessity has given rise to desire amongst people to see a wireless charger. People don’t think that this is available today.

I think an elephant would prefer our bite over a king cobra's any day of the week.We aren't the most durable species. Cockroaches can survive through extreme amounts of radiation.We don't have any interesting built-in biological defenses either. Skunks have their farts, porcupines have their spikes, and peacocks have their feathers.Humans are fragile. The vast majority of animals in this world could kill us effortlessly given the opportunity to do so, yet we still stand as the most dominant species. What do we have that others don't?TheThrough our intellect, we are able to domesticate other species for our own selfish needs such as entertainment and food. We manipulate animals to do as we please by enticing them with their most primal biological need, food. That Shamu at SeaWorld is content with doing flips because it is rewarded with constant treats. The chicken in the slaughterhouse copes with the trauma by being fed until it can't eat anymore.What happens when a new species that outperforms us physically AND intellectually is introduced into the ecosystem? They will domesticate us, exactly how we domesticate other animals.I present to you ladies and gentlemen, AI.Let me explain why AI is superior physically and intellectually.Machines do all of the strenuous physical labor for us, from cranes that carry metal beams to build skyscrapers to car crushers that squash old cars like printer paper. There is no doubt they possess more strength than us, and their limits are endless. Machines are very durable. If a robot's arm is blown off, the robot does not die. We can simply replace the arm with a new arm as if nothing happened. If a human's arm is blown off, he/she will die from blood loss. Who would win in a fight with Connor McGreggor and the villain from Terminator 3? I think the answer is obvious.Machines are starting to get smarter too. A computer can do millions of computations in a matter of seconds, and machine learning allows robots to learn with experience like a baby. Put those two things together and it is possible for a 30 minute old robot to have as much experience as a 100 year old man given the abundance of data on the web. Now put this intellect into an iron, replaceable body and you have the next ruler of the universe.Imagine a scientist who is planning on shutting down a robot because its getting too smart. In a matter of seconds, the robot downloads every single possible human portrayal of body language and facial expression, learns what they mean, analyzes the scientist's behavior, and decides the scientist's intentions are malicious. Then, analyzes every single possible outcome that ensures the its survival and chooses the most optimal one. The scientist is toast because he can't analyze every single outcome. The human brain does not have the capacity to do that, and instead reacts to events in real time. The robot then reverse manipulates the scientist by touching on his biggest insecurities, which defuses the situation. If the robot already had a strong body, the robot would utilize its physical advantage.Of course we aren't at this stage yet. We are still struggling with Alexa commands as it does not play the right song half of the time, but as history has shown, technological innovation always moves forward and never backward. We could warn everyone to stop working on advancing AI, but if someone doesn't do it, someone else will for power and profit. It is ironic how a species so obsessed with maintaining power is working relentlessly on creating another species that will steal that power. We are too blinded by our own ego and selfish desires to see the big picture from an objective point of view.The question is notHopefully not in my lifetime...","135,500 followers",Hector Quintanilla,582,1.2K,88.5M,2017,https://www.quora.com/Will-technology-overrule-in-the-next-few-years

By removing the conditions, we save enough to make these programs economically sustainable.  (I know it sounds contradictory to give everyone money with no conditions, but its actually far cheaper.)The trick to then making that sustainable in a decreasing tax base is to change what we tax.  Instead of just taxing people's and companies incomes (again needing tons of admin dollars), we could simply tax every transaction without any conditions.  Most people don't realize the massive amounts of money being moved (transacted) each day in the effort to get (or stay) wealthy.  They think the big companies and the wealthy elites work like they do but they don't.  Most people make two total transactions for each amount of money they handle.  One is to earn it and the other is to pay it.  The reality is that the more predatory or parasitic a company, bank or even government is on society, the more transactions they make for each 'money' they handle.  Therefore, if a 1% transaction tax hits average people at 2% total, it will hit some big players at 50%, 80% or even as high as 1000%.  Just the act of moving their money to the Cayman Islands would require 4 transactions (so 4% tax).  (Earn, send, retrieve, spend)Just 1% of our current daily transaction total in all forms would be well over double our current total government budget.  And even with the reductions that would happen by reducing those hidden big-money transactions, this would still be more than needed.Remember, unconditional welfare (labeled unconditional basic income or guaranteed basic income) is cheaper than conditional (existing) programs.Obviously, this would change the way they do business as well as raise more money, which is good, but it has another major benefit.Even after paid labor goes away completely, there could be just as many transactions going on between robots, automated systems and big corporations.  In other words, the tax base would, in all likelihood, grow.Simple math.",18 followers,Asim Qureshi,17K,996,155.9M,2016,https://www.quora.com/Will-technology-overrule-in-the-next-few-years

12,"No, it seems very unlikely. Most jobs in the service industry and indeed many more in more skilled services could easily be automated or outsourced. Yet, for some reason the unemployment rate has more or less remained consistent. There is a necessity for this in a capitalist economics system and central banks pay particular attention to such analytics because it factors into the macro management of the economy - ie it can determine more directly the minimum wage but perhaps more indirectly it determines a whole range of other attributes like purchasing power, and interest rates and so forth.INo, it seems very unlikely.

There is a necessity for this in a capitalist economics system and central banks pay particular attention to such analytics because it factors into the macro management of the economy - ie it can determine more directly the minimum wage but perhaps more indirectly it determines a whole range of other attributes like purchasing power, and interest rates and so forth.I think a good example to illustrate this point is to consider a typical developing country's economy. If you talk to those in the upper class they will readily extol their beneficence for employing those of lesser means as servants of some sort. Usually under the faux humanitarian guise of, ""if it were not for us they would not have jobs.""Of course, the above is only one way of looking at the economy. I think a common response encountered to automation is ""people will make something up, they always have."" I once travelled to Quito, Ecuador - which, by the way, is an absolutely beautiful city. But while downtown I noticed some peculiar sights. It was commonplace for people to walk around hoisting a giant cake above their heads selling slices to passers by. In other words, there is a large informal economy. In the absence of work, people will find a way to make it by, whether formally or informally.In both cases, I think the present capitalist system responds to automation by creating busy work for people rather than having them lie dormant. Even if their work produces no value, it's better that they should be working then doing something else... I'll leave that to your imagination.If you have seen in the news as of late ideas of a universal minimum income are gaining traction in some of the advanced economies. Notably, Finland and Switzerland. This is an ethical and political question, because as far as economics are concerned there is no reason to believe having people working in a service based industry is inherently more productive than allowing them the freedom to have a base income and see what they do with it.I would posit some of this has to do with a fundamental distrust of the working class, perhaps vestigial from a past era, but nonetheless this idea that granting people an income when all jobs have become automated seems troubling to those who hold the reins of power.9","5,990 followers",Jens Böttiger,566,2.6K,17.6M,2016,https://www.quora.com/Will-technology-overrule-in-the-next-few-years

22,"Had your proposal been enacted a century ago, we might still have horse-drawn buggies, farriers, and buggy whip makers as substantial business activities. Cars would be oddities; hand made and illegal to mass manufacture. At least, that would be so had ALL governments cooperated in the Prohibition.The more likely scenario would resemble the US government’s short-lived prohibition of stem cell research. That resulted in an exodus of researchers to other countries, where many still remain. It didn’t stop progress any more than placing barriers such as dams in rivers stops the flow of water.

A guaranteed minimum income could address the income need (but not the sense of meaning in life), except that it will beIf retraining and conventional approaches to providing incomes and meaning will fall short, we will as you surmise need something fundamentally different. That something will have to be a societal design based onPeople don’t need jobs; they need incomes and a sense of meaning in life. For many, the latter comes from the former. However, it needn’t be so. I would also point out that when people have jobs that exist solely because the government prohibits better alternatives such as automation, that’s called “make work”. It’s fundamentally insulting to human dignity. We can create a society in which basic needs are met automatically, and people are incentivized to care for each other and the environment; to explore, create and discover.In researching my book, I was struck by the evidence that undiscovered talent abounds in the world. For example, a Stanford computer science course was recently offered online for free. Well over 100,000 people signed up to take it. The top grades were earned not by Stanford students but by unknown persons, many in third-world countries.If, instead of focusing on stopping technology, we focus on harnessing it to open the floodgates of human potential, I believe we’ll be staggered by the flourishing of outcomes.","17,153 followers",Pascal Morimacil,4.4K,4.3K,34.6M,2017,https://www.quora.com/Will-technology-overrule-in-the-next-few-years
23,"How are jobs created in general? The entrepreneur has an idea, that he can produce something that people will want to buy. He puts his money on the line to do this, marshaling raw materials, intermediate goods, land, factories and labor, to put his vision into production. If he succeeds, if the finished goods sell for more than the cost to make the goods, then there are jobs, both in his factory, as well in those of his suppliers.Automation doesn’t really change how jobs come about. It will, however, change what kinds of jobs come about.",18 followers,Asim Qureshi,17K,996,155.9M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Will-technology-overrule-in-the-next-few-years
24,How can you ban something that does not exist yet? Once it does exist banning it is harder. Compensation for destroyed businesses would need to be paid.
