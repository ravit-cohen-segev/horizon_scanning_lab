Baron argues the uncertainties regarding Arctic land set the stage for a possible war. Formerly thick, unbreakable ice, climate change has reduced the Arctic to retreating glaciers and melting ice. There is still no land, but there’s now more water for ships to move—and drill for oil. The U.S., Canada, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Russia, and Sweden all have a physical stake in the 3-million-square-mile region, and while it’s governed by international law, there’s nothing that says countries must obey that law. “The race to create new technologies to explore commercial gains in the Arctic should never fall out of the news cycle. Decisions made in one country about what to employ in the region could affect the entire world. Furthermore, technology once used for biological and geological research can easily become co-opted for military and commercial gain. This dual-use dilemma is something researchers may not have previously considered,” Baron writes.Your Digital TwinHave you ever wished you were a twin? Your mother may not have been able to make that happen, but a binary code can. A digital twin is a virtual copy of you that can be analyzed without your presence. Combined with personalized medicine, a digital twin is a gigantic step forward for human health. For example, an analysis of your digital twin could predict weeks or months in advance if you’re heading for a heart attack. Of course, it can also do the opposite: unauthorized and unethical experiments could be performed on your twin without your knowledge—and anything with a binary code is open to hacking.MIT’s Version of “Inception”This year, MIT researchers debuted Dormio, a sleep-tracking device that can alter dreams by tracking hypnagogia and then delivering audio cues based on incoming physiological data, at precise times in the sleep cycle, to make dream direction possible. For example, before sleeping, you choose a theme like “rabbits,” and then, once you begin sleeping, sounds associated with this theme are used to a) remind you of the theme at targeted times and b) suspend you in early sleep stages, so you can still hear the sound even as you dream. According to the researchers, upon awakening, a person’s guided dream content can be used to complete tasks such as creative story writing, and compared experimentally to waking thought content. But what if a person’s dream is something illegal, even deadly? And what if someone nefarious got ahold of your Dormio? Hello nightmares and possible psychological trauma.Robot AbuseDo you say sorry to inanimate objects if you run into them? Some people do, more out of reflux than anything. But what if the object was a robot that could walk and talk and, overall, act like a human? You would think most people would definitely be nice to it then, but it turns out “robot abuse” is a common thing. Humans all over the world have been caught mercilessly harming robots “for fun.” Then again, does it matter if we hurt a robot since it’s not a living thing? Baron poses a series of questions that we may not have the answers to right now, but raise some incredibly interesting points for the future: “Should there be rules, or even laws protecting [robots] from deliberate harm? If we abuse them, what does that say about us? And will allowing people to abuse robots lead to more aggression, perhaps against humans or animals? But perhaps the most important question is: is it truly immoral to mistreat a robot?”“Stalkerware” AppsReports of domestic abuse and family violence have increased around the world since social isolation and quarantine measures came to be. Some states in the U.S. have reported an increase in domestic abuse incidents by more than 40%. As victims are resigned to stay in place with their abusers, “stalkerware” surveillance apps have made matters worse. Stalkerware apps, which relay private information including location, photos, audio, browser and messaging history, are easy to install on someone’s phone—and they hide in plain sight. It’s difficult enough for victims to escape their abusers, only to find out they are still being tracked by their phone, which is often considered a lifeline.The Data Void Left by Search EnginesIt’s rare for a search engine to spit out a small amount of information when you search for something, but it can happen. When there is little to no relevant information on a specific topic, it’s called a “data void.” A data void by itself if not negative; the problem occurs when humans step in. Once people find and/or predict a data void, they create webpages and resources to exploit the void, redirecting searches to sites with anything from ads and viruses to conspiracy theories and misinformation. You can’t believe everything you read on the internet, and yet, a lot of people do. “Once it’s on the Internet, it becomes fodder for everyone from talk radio hosts to angry people who spend all day on social media sharing stories and videos that reinforce their view of the world,” Baron said.Telemedicine—For SomeIf you had a telemedicine appointment with your doctor during COVID-19, you are in good company. Before the pandemic, only 1% of medical appointments were done virtually. At the height of COVID-19, more than 50% of appointments were telemedicine. While that number is expected to decrease as the pandemic slows, the metaphorical cat is out of the bag and there’s no way to get him back in. For some, telemedicine is a fantastic option. “But the drawbacks include unequal access to healthcare among those without Internet access, untreated illnesses for those with conditions not conducive to telehealth, and clinician fatigue,” Baron explains. Additionally, as with most virtual medical situations, privacy concerns abound.App Profits off ForeclosuresThe unrelenting economic effects of COVID-19 caused many people to fall behind on their rent and mortgages. Of course, someone, somewhere, saw this as an opportunity. A “gig economy” app company developed Civvl, a service that contracts eviction crews to secure foreclosed residential properties. A spokesman for the company told CBS News, “Civvl is not actually carrying out evictions, but rather connecting independent junk haulers or contractors with opportunities to clear out property. It's basically like a job center. This is no different than you going on Monster Jobs - Job Search, Career Advice & Hiring Resources | Monster.com."" The app charges workers $35 a month to use the service on top of a 30% cut of their earnings. Many reviews accuse it of being a scam, taking a monthly fee but never connecting an individual to a job even though the app says the average is 6 jobs per day. Other reviews from non-users accuse the app of human rights violations and just not being nice: ""Attempting to profit off of human suffering is pure evil, especially during a global pandemic,"" one reviewer wrote.DoomscrollingLocal news used to (and still does) get a bad rep for constantly being negative—it’s all doom and gloom. Adults 50+ could easily escape the bad news when needed by turning off the television, or not picking up the newspaper. It’s different for today’s generation, though. Information from the entire world in in the palm of our hands—and it’s addictive. Doomscrolling (also called doomsurfing) is the act of constantly consuming negative online content to the detriment of your mental health. Baron notes the term has been around since at least 2018 but, for obvious reasons, 2020 took it to an extreme. The murder of George Floyd, BLM protests, COVID-19, the presidential election, the results of the presidential election—it was a tumultuous year that played right into the hands of doomscrolling.FacebookBaron included Facebook in the Tech Top 10 List even before multiple antitrust lawsuits were filed late last week. Does that mean she’s on to something? Possibly. The staggering amount of Facebook users— 2.45 billion monthly—is concerning when considering how many ethical violations and dilemmas the social media platform has been involved with in recent years. In 2018, U.N. human rights investigators concluded that Facebook played a key role in spreading hate speech in Myanmar that fueled a “military crackdown” that involved the mass killing and rape of refugees. Some have even called it a genocide. In the 2016 election, Russian trolls used Facebook to promote ads featuring conspiracy theories and misinformation that over 10 million people saw. In 2020, the platform is riddled with “fake news” and misinformation that they say they are trying to get under control. “The fact that we are so entangled in the platform that it would seriously affect our lives to close our accounts is a sign that we’re being manipulated. Facebook thinks it’s ‘neutral’ but also ‘moving in the right direction.’ That alone should make users wary of its ability to be a tool for good,” Baron writes.","14,900 followers",Krister Sundelin,880,23.8K,89.8M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-are-10-scientific-problems-that-may-be-solved-in-2021

Through drying and friction it turns out to dust and through air is going to all surfaces, at first stage the uro-genital organs, causing UTI, and later to all house, causing food contamination.That phenomenon is more intense inThe flying fecal dust emerges mainly from cloths of patients that can MOVE around, not the ones that are on pampers. Have in mind that in a more than 2 beds hospital wards, moisture and temperature conditions harbor microbes and also microbe density, due to constant feeding from feces residue on patients, is a one more factor that increases microbe chances in developing antibiotic resistance.It is obvious that the known hygiene measures, as is hand washing etc, are not enough, as nowUp to now NOT A SINGLE scientific study have ever doubted fecal dust’s existence and its role on microbe dispersion, but however no hygiene measures are imposed or advice is given by Health Institutes, particularly to women to prevent UTI, or any guiding to hospital hygiene managers to reduce HAI and the growing danger of microbe resistant to antibiotics.WhyThe COMPARISON TEST could be done in one 10 or 100 or more hospitals which take measures to prevent fecal dust, so to have more reliable results. In the one side we will have the known 99.000 deaths/yr and the in other the number of f. the 1.000 or 100.000 deaths /yr. Comparing the two numbers will give us the needed answer.Or comparing a hospital’s known HAI rates, with a year period, the same hospital, during which, are taken only the “extra” measures, that is to prevent fecal dust?On the case this test is not done promptly, everyone is entitled to think,It is obvious that only the facts given from the above comparison test, could prove or not this theory’s value.Many would say: why don’t you do it by yourself? My answer is:1. I am not allowed. I am an MD but retired. 2. I tried to cooperate with hospital doctors. They talked about expenses that usually are offered by Pharma Cos.

This is not just restricted to the party-boy Space Wolves or the violent Carcharodons and Flesh-Tearers. Marines of any chapter are very likely to see themselves as the Emperor’s hammer, and every problem as being a nail. This is a byproduct of the propaganda, indoctrination, and also experience. Some astartes have fought for centuries, and only fought, being supported in any other endeavor by chapter serfs, and allowing any part of their problem solving strategies to atrophy.Indeed, the less they think, the more they adhere to orders and regulations, the more they might be praised. This means that for all the intelligence they may have, astartes are just as likely to be dumb as stumps.Fortunately for astartes, since their brains have been enhanced, they do have the ability to learn and quickly. The issue may be whether they have the time and opportunity.So, while all astartes have the potential to be very intelligent, the actual intelligence varies from individual to individual.",539 followers,Papa Shadow,887,174,4.8M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-are-10-scientific-problems-that-may-be-solved-in-2021

Though he still played a pivotal role in the defense of his world.Hence why in Helsreach Grimaldus was given overall command of the city and its defenses as he was a high ranking member of the Black Templars overall forces on the planet.While some Astartes may be less inclined to do this, like the marines malevolent, and the Minotaurs, others specialize in this area, such as the Mentors, who largely fight only in squads and often not even that, with one marine being sent out to act as a advisor or even overall commander.Now one area of Astartes intellect is a bit questionable for some, this being emotional intelligence, meaning how they understand and react to emotional responses and other actions. This is best showcased in Helsreach again as Grimaldus while hyper intelligent in war is almost entirely unable to understand the emotions of many of his human command staff, like the two officers who fall in love and Andrea’s desire to be able to impress the woman who wished to marry. Though this also seems to be author interpretations/writing styles as many other Astartes still can understand these connections and feelings but are more distant from them like Dante and Calgar, or Grimnar and Tu’Shan, who all seem to still under mortals to a far greater degree than Grimaldus. This also Amy simply be differences in personalities or even in the different cultures of space Marines as the more distant chapters such as the Dark Angels, Black Templars, and sometimes Imperial Fists all seem more likely to act this way.

However this again is by far the lowest records.Primaris Space Marines are taller, bigger, and significantly stronger than their firstborn counterparts. Taking their enhanced strength in account, they should be able to lift from 5–11 tons (averaging at 7) inside of their armor.The size difference isn’t this dramatic in the lore, but they are noticeably bigger nonetheless.The last Space Marines I’ll go over are the Terminators.Bigger than even Primaris marines, these suits were originally used for mining and construction purposes. These enhance the marine’s strength significantly at the cost of speed. They’re so strong they can wield Dreadnaught weapons with one hand. They can lift anywhere from 5–20 tons (10–12 Average) in their suit. But that’s pushing it. That’s about as high as it gets AND that’s with the marine giving it all he’s got.Now for Halo Spartans:It is said that Spartans (at least Spartan 2’s) on average lift 3x their body weight inside of their armor. Which considering the weight of the genetically modified man and the set of Mjolnir armor is usually between 700lbs and 1000lbs. Meaning they can lift around 3–5 tons inside of their armor. I don’t read or play enough Halo to provide examples.

Usually when a Marine is critically injured during combat but is still alive to be saved, they are put inside Dreadnoughts. Tech marines take great care of Dreadnoughts, saying preservation prayers, applying sacred oils and fixing any damage it might have sustained in combat. They cannot get out of it since they’re hooked up to a life support system inside, and probably don’t have limbs to moveThey are given walkers with the firepower of a tank in exchange for their actual body’s health, which is a fine trade if you ask me.",0 followers,Alexander Novak,838,52,599.1K,2020,https://www.quora.com/How-intelligent-are-Space-Marines

And so on.Back in the good ole’ days, comConsidering that we are still only typically using 46-bit computers…No, not a typo.Let me explain what these bits mean. Memory in a computer is accessed using an address. Each address represents a byte. There is data at byte 0, at byte 1, at byte 2, … etc.When the computer’s processor requests data from the computer’s operative memory (RAM), it has to provide an address. A single electrical wire can have two states: off and on. That can correspond to byte 0 and byte 1. Two wires can have four states in total, addressing byte 0 through byte 3 in memory. And so on.Back in the good ole’ days, computers had 16-bit addresses. That means a total of 65536 memory locations (64 kilobytes). That was a lot back, say, in 1980, but not today.So there came 32-bit addresses, and for a while we were doing just fine. In fact, at first, processors that internally handled 32-bit addresses only had, say, 20 or 24 wires to access physical memory. With 20 wires, a total of 1,048,576 bytes (a megabyte) can be addressed. With 24 wires, it goes up to 16 megabytes.Now 16 megabytes was a Big Deal in, say, 1988. But soon, we had computers with hundreds of megabytes of memory, so now processors provided a full set of 32 address wires. This made it possible to access up to 4,096 megabytes (4 gigabytes) of RAM. That was good for a while… but not today.So we need more address bits. Going from 32-bit to 64-bit, that is. But do we really need 64-bit addresses? Not anytime soon. We are not exactly in need of 17,179,869,184 gigabytes of memory. Sure, the total amount of computer RAM in the world is a lot more than that, but individual computers rarely have more than a few dozen gigabytes of RAM even today, in 2019.Processor makers are aware of this, and know that there is no point providing a full set of 64 address wires in modern processors. That’s why a typical Intel processor “only” has 46 such wires, even though it internally treats addresses as 64-bit. Even with 46 wires, a processor can address 65,536 gigabytes, or 64 terabytes of RAM. That is still a lot more than the largest hard disk drive, so we are okay for now.Will we ever need more than 64 address bits, though? Perhaps. Will computers ever have more than 16,777,216 terabytes (that is, 16 exabytes) of memory? Sounds like an outrageous amount of RAM, but it wasn’t that long ago that 16 gigabytes sounded outrageous, too. Yet today, there are smartphones with this much memory. (I am talking about operative memory, not persistent storage.) So yes, I am pretty sure that in the next few decades, barring world wars, killer asteroids, or bioweapons gone berserk, we will have processors capable of addressing more than 16 exabytes of RAM.Will that mean a switch to 128-bit addresses? Now that, I do not know. While bigger addresses offer the ability to more RAM, they also make programs ever so slightly bigger and ever so slightly slower. And there are other ways to address additional memory. In any case, even if 128-bit internal address representations become common, it does not mean that processors will have 128 address wires. After all, a mere 80 address wires already allow accessing more than a million exabytes (that would be a yottabyte) of RAM. And for all I know, by the time this happens, we may have a brand new paradigm in computing.By way of past examples, as recently as 2000 or thereabouts, people were predicting that soon, we’ll have processors running at clock speeds of several ten gigahertz. That didn’t happen. Such processors would have been immensely hard to manufacture and would produce copious quantities of waste heat. Instead, we ended up with processors containing multiple processing cores. Perhaps something similar will happen with memory: Instead of providing one ginormous contiguous address space, future computers may divide up physical memory among a large number of processor cores, effectively creating a miniature computer network on chip. Or maybe instead of having as many addressing wires as there are address bits, address information would be communicated by other means, much like the switch, not too long ago, from the “PATA” parallel interface that was used to access hard disk drives to the serial “SATA” interface employing much fewer wires.For now though, we’re a long way away from exhausting the capabilities offered by 64 address bits. Remember: a typical Intel processor is really only a 46-bit processor, as it has only 46 address wires that can be used to connect the processor to memory.By the way, a full 128-bit address can access 281,474,976,710,656 yottabytes of memory.","31,159 followers",Phillip Remaker,845,11K,78.8M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-are-10-scientific-problems-that-may-be-solved-in-2021

But we didn’t really need to go to 64-bit architecture and OS to solve this problem… in fact, a 40-bit architecture would have allowed 1 terabyte of addressable memory space, which would have been more than enough for the foreseeable future.You see, for every bit you add to the architecture, you are doubling the number of addresses that are available. The addresses are basically the number of combinations that can be formed given a certain number of bits. For example:1 bit = 0 or 1, which is a total of 2 combinations2 bits = 00, 01 , 10, or 11, which is a total of 4 combinations3 bits = 000, 001, 010, 011, 100, 101, 110, or 111, which is a total of 8 combinationsSo going from 32 bits (which is a total of 4,294,967,296 combinations) to 64 bits (which is a total of 18,446,744,073,709,551,616 combinations) is already overkill.
