Just not the Church.It was going on six months since losing my job at a CALDOR department Store (They went out of business).Here’s a pic for those too young to know.The job paid $4.35 per hour in 1998. And it was my full time job. I was going to auto tech school at night hoping for a better career one day.I started drinking heavy. I didn’t care. It was bad enough that I was already poor, on welfare and housing assistance. But when all that misery combined with alcohol, my situation made me feel even more hopeless. And I was ready to let go.But life turned into a blessing on that fateful(SOOOO EMBARRASSING!)I started to walk out after my purchase when I decided to buy a NY Daily News. But it’s too early. No daily news, only The NY Times. So I grabbed one, handed over my $1.50 and walked out.I immediately went to the help wanted ads when I got back in my apartment. And there it was. The biggest help wanted add on the page.$12 - $18 per hour.For one day only 9AM-12PM. on that following Monday.Doors close promptly at 12.I was twenty-four years old and never came close to earning $5 per hour.I woke up early that Monday morning. And gave myself two hours to get there for a trip that takes about one hour. I put on my Sunday best, grabbed some résumés and started my trip to the JFK Hilton.I arrived and found the conference room and it was barren. There were only about fifty people in the conference room. It didn’t feel like a job fair. I almost turned around because I thought I was in the wrong place.We were called in the order that we signed in. I watched as some people left after the short interview and some sat back down. I was one of the people that was told to sit back down after my interview.Round two came as fast as round one. This company has this job fair thing down to a science. I’m called back up to the table by Mrs. Alexander. I will never forget her. She hands me a drug test cup and says follow me. A drug test! at a job fair. Probably the best way to weed out the druggies.After that, I fill out all my employment forms. And then she says. “let’s go over some things while we wait for your results. Because of your experience and interests I have decided to hire you as a motor pool mechanic. This is your rate of pay, you will be on 90 days probation with random drug testing, report to this man at this location this time next Monday. Now read and sign your code of ethics booklet.”(And with the most beautiful motherly I understand what you have been going through smile) Mrs. Alexander says “Congratulations Gerry and fix your tie.”I’M HIRED! The whole process took all of 40 minutes. I went from $4.35 per hour. To $16.52 in 40 minutes. I walked out of that Hilton with tears in my eyes.It only gets better from there. I start work and immediately fall in love with the company, the work hours, the people, and of course the pay. Life got good and was only going to get better.I get great advice from an older worker. One can go anywhere in this company. Just get your Qualies (Qualifications) for everything, go to class for everything, read and study everything and then get your ass out of the motor pool.So I did just that. I went from repairing company vehicles at the motor pool, to lineman electrician, and now my present position as a locomotive engineer earning six figures. Six figures with a high school degree and a technical school certificate. And I can honestly say that I do not mind paying taxes at the end of every year.Being poor and uneducated gave me serious depression. And That Sunday NY Times was destiny.Something was definitely pulling the strings behind the scenes for me. I was going the opposite direction of where I am today.",660 followers,Gerry Sankara,11.2K,143,1.6M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-life-changing-technologies-coming-out-soon

I never dreamt of stylishness, richness and money.I always had a desire to become a saint. I'm a very ordinary soul, living a very simple life. I never craved for making money in life. I was adjusted to the normal lifestyle.I never used to become jealous of anybody's wealth or dress. I used to prefer peace over money.People crave to look stylish, everyone is obsessed with their looks and their brand outfits, but I neither gave importance to my look nor about my outfits.I always had a dream to leave this materialistic world and to take oath as a saint in Himalayas.I believed in simplicity.> I believed in “Don’t be workaholic and money minded person, because the white cloth which will be wrapped around your dead body will have no pockets.”So, I never thought of becoming rich in life. Literally I had zero desire towards money.> Today!An incident at 2 am shook me away!!My mother asked me to wake up. She was tensed like hell.> Me: Maa, what happened? (I was in shock)She: Your father is struggling to breathe.I ran towards my father. He was literally struggling to breathe and His heart was having a burning sensation.For a moment I was stunned and didn't know what to do?We decided to take him to the hospital. I took out my neighbors mobile number from my dad's phone. (I didn't bother to keep my neighbors number till that moment)I called my neighbor at 2:30 am.At 2:35 am, he came out of his home and he took out his car and waiting for us.> Do you believe that? I've been living in this house for the last 6.5 years but have never spoke to my neighbor. Sadly yes, you should believe it.I spoke to him today for the first time in the span of 6.5 years.Somehow, my father felt quite at ease after sometime. So we dropped the plan of going to the hospital.My neighbor and his family came up to my house, as they were waiting outside in a car. They suggested some home remedies. My father felt ease after trying out the suggestion.I thanked my neighbors for coming up at the right time to help. My neighbors asked me to call at any moment, they will be there to help me.My father felt at ease and went to sleep at 3 am. Everything came back to normal, but not my mind.I couldn't sleep after that incident.That's when my life changed! I will explain you in detail in the last paragraph of this answer.A lot of thoughts going in my mind at that very short moment, when I saw my father struggling to breathe.* Can I call my supervisor to extend my leave for the entire week?","41,553 followers",Rakshith Akira,23.7K,467,18.3M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-life-changing-technologies-coming-out-soon

Therefore, there must be abundant life near other stars.  But we really don't know.  It is conceivable that the probability is so tiny, that if you plug it into Drake's equation you find that we expect life to have formed only once in the entire universe.My own guess (and this is not a scientific theory) is that there was a precursor form of living molecule that was capable of carrying limited genetic information, much less than RNA, and still capable of reproducing.  When RNA developed, the more primitive form of life could not compete, and was literally eaten up.There is a science fiction story that illustrates this.  A group of advanced computers rules the world. One little baby computer asks, ""How did computers come to being?""The mommy computer answers, ""We don't really know. We can trace our beginnings back to a microprocessor that was first created in what we call year zero"" [in human years, this corresponds to the late 1900s, but mommy computer doesn't know that], ""but we can't conceive how that first microprocessor was created. It's too complex to have come about by chance.  Maybe there was a primitive life form that preceded it, and which is now completely wiped out. Carbon is on the same part of the periodic table as Silicon, so some people think it might have been a carbon-based life form.  But carbon doesn't make very good electronic circuits, so I think this idea is foolish.""",264 followers,Surojit Mahato,3.3K,0,0,2016,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-life-changing-technologies-coming-out-soon

Came back after 45 mins. I took a shower and got dressed.I sat down in a corner of my house, closed my eyes, and started focusing on my breaths. I sat there in complete silence and tried to observe my thoughts.I saw the utter chaos my mind was experiencing. I was worried about every small thing in the world. I felt like I was in the middle of a battleground.I tried to trace back the origin of every thought and find out why I was thinking this way.When I opened my eyes, I was it was only 5 mins but it felt like an hour.I felt good. I had taken the first step.It’s been 7 days now, and I want to say that meditation didn’t solve any of my problems. In fact, it has no relation to the things I was going through.But, it is helping stay calm in tense situations and think from multiple perspectives. I am having better sleep and I am able to focus my energy on things that matter the most.The morning ritual is helping me a lot.When I wake up at 5 am and go for a run, and I see almost no one the roads, I feel I am ahead. When I come back, take shower, meditate and have a mega breakfast, I feel I have conquered the world.

Our minds and bodies will (if we want them to be) wired to control 3D printers and AIs and clouds of nano drones.I think it’s likely that we’ll have a solid grasp on quantum entanglement in 50 years and be able to use it for communication (my understanding is that this currently seems possible). If it is it could mean traveling to space with a cloud of nano robots, expanding our senses to feel variations in magnetic, gravitational and other spectrum.We may be able to decide to merge with groups of other people in a literal way (mentally) where we share our experiences, memories and attitudes.

But they would have an abundance of material on Earth, especially of carbon, which would likely be the building blocks of such an assemblers. If you were carrying a jar of them and tripped and they spilled out, and they had no limit, they would quickly devour the entire earth with no way of stopping them.But here is where things get interesting: These tiny robots would have the ability to construct molecules from atoms, giving them the ability to produce amazing materials like graphene, cubes of apple, and even brain material.With advanced nanotechnology in the form of self-replicators, the entire world would experience a revolution. Think for a second about what wouldn’t change in the face of machines that can produceProduction jobs would cease. The price of every item ever created would be lowered massively. Supercomputers and experiments regarding brain material would become almost commonplace. Terraforming other planets would take years if not months.

It’s one of the best tools at our disposal now for significantly reducing human suffering and needless death.","5,990 followers",Jens Böttiger,566,2.6K,17.6M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-life-changing-technologies-coming-out-soon
22,"The sky is the limit. Currently it is revolutionizing industries one after another with agriculture and medicine being two of its most important roles today. Some heavy inroads being made in the energy sector via (gmo) corn ethanol and microbes that produce fuel as well, along with textiles (gmo cotton). This trend will continue.SOME FUTURE STUFF:The sky is the limit. Currently it is revolutionizing industries one after another with agriculture and medicine being two of its most important roles today. Some heavy inroads being made in the energy sector via (gmo) corn ethanol and microbes that produce fuel as well, along with textiles (gmo cotton). This trend will continue.SOME FUTURE STUFF:Organs will be cloned from your tissues and grown in either a factory or perhaps inside pigs bloated full of a backup of all your organs in a farm for harvest in case of emergencies.Gene therapy will develop further and allow us to safely cure genetic diseases. With this knowledge and the cheap access to these technologies, some of us will decide to extend the utility of technology designed for... say... curing colorblindness to adding a fourth photoreceptor to increase human capabilities beyond their original state.This will open the door to ""gene doping"" in sports and create a dilemma.Services will allow you to design your pet the same way you can customize a car.Babies will be ""debugged"" of genetic diseases prior to birth (or immediately after) which is only a stone throw away from ""improved"" physiologically/intellectually or even ""designed"" cosmetically with the same technology used to create your perfect pet. Problems will arise when someone decides they want to make their kid born with autism.DNA has useful properties for computation in and of itself. We may be able to create living, multiplying, interconnected computers.Microbes are essentially tiny machines as well as tiny chemical refineries. We will combine this ability with computers to make new materials and chemicals for a variety of purposes.This will allow the creation of nanomachines (which is essentially what cell organelles ARE)...Along with new weapons that potential to kill individual targets or even ethnic groups and open the door to new forms of bioterrorism.The fusion of computer facilitated bioengineering will usher in the creation of NEW organisms with novel traits that never existed in nature that would straddle the boundary between ""biological machine"" and ""synthetic animal"".----deeper into the future----As with the above technologies, some will apply it to themselves, perhaps radically changing society (not necessarily negatively) and make new subcultures of body experimenters. New generations will be born that aren't afraid of biological diversity, leading to definition of human that is unlike anything we are familiar with today. Soldiers, along with people of other professions might be given an injection that improve their efficiency. Humans aren't made for zero gravity (it's really, really, unhealthy) something we could fix.I have more, but I'm writing a biopunk book and don't want to spill my juicier and more original predictions.",UNKNOWN,Kanthaswamy Balasubramaniam,898,17.3K,413.5M,2015,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-life-changing-technologies-coming-out-soon
