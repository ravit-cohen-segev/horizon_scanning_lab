From the 1950s to the 1990s, the US de-urbanized with suburban sprawl.It’s not a good idea, though.

Once those became common, the US (for example) did de-urbanize away from dense cities like Manhattan into the suburbs. From the 1950s to the 1990s, the US de-urbanized with suburban sprawl.It’s not a good idea, though. As an example, I’ve got a friend in this bit of Colorado shown below, a picturesque rural town far from crowded cities like Denver and sea level oxygen partial pressure. (I was visiting from Florida. The change in oxygen content was noticeable.)On one hand, my friend was capable of largely working from home before COVID-19 made that cool. She had internet access, electricity, running water, and a beer brewery in her barn. Thanks to her car, she could visit clients’ sites as needed. There was no need to live in a big city.On the other hand, this bit of God’s Country was dotted with countless vacation homes. They’re hard to see in this picture since they’re all hidden in the hills and trees for the best, scenic views, but they were there, human habitation sprawling all over the wilderness.Now imagine dumping the urbanized 82% of the US’s population across the landscape, and then repeat that with the rest of Earth’s billions. We could sprawl all over the landscape, plowing under beautiful landscape in endless suburbs and exurbs.(Wilderness beauty paved over by a de-urbanized population.)Cities often get knocked as bad for the environment, but they’re a lot better than having the same population spread across the rest of the landscape.So a counter question would be, “Maybe the technological advancement required for large-scale de-urbanization isn’t the car and internet, but something much further into the future: sufficient space development that most of humanity can live in space habitats.Get most of humanity’s future billions (or trillions) into space and then the few tens of millions left deep in Earth’s gravity well can living in the empty, de-urbanized landscape.","5,990 followers",Jens Böttiger,566,2.6K,17.6M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-role-of-advanced-technology-in-the-degradation-of-the-environment
1,"Problem:As an example, the Sahara desert is growing at an alarming rate. Some studies have shown that Africa has lost approximately 650,000 km² of its productive agricultural land over the past 50 yearsPossible solution:Possible opportunity:Problem:As an example, the Sahara desert is growing at an alarming rate. Some studies have shown that Africa has lost approximately 650,000 km² of its productive agricultural land over the past 50 yearsPossible solution:Possible opportunity:Technological problem:Technological advancement needed:That is the breakthrough point!We can create huge power plants and install thousands of pumps, and use this (extremely) cheap solar power to continuously desalinate and pump millions of liters of water back into the deserts! Of course many other technologies would be needed to do this at a vast scale, but none is more challenging than creating more consumable energy at a cheaper cost! The planet Earth has more than enough land-area to sustain a lot many more organisms, and those organisms have more than enough ways to sustain themselves! The only missing link — water — is the most plentiful resource on the planet, and yet it is the one used nearly the least.For the skeptics:Of course this rate of cost reduction is not sustainable, but if the need is high enough, if the political will is there, if just a bit of the arms-money goes into solar research instead, this price-point can be reduced significantly! Once you add the benefits of adding millions of tress to the planet in an area that was totally unsuitable for life, the amount of extra oxygen / lesser global warming, and the costs of dealing with the harm caused each of those, humanity can more than easily find ways to reduce the cost of producing energy and terra-forming the deserts in such a way that benefits life in general!Look at all that empty region where no one lives right nowMuch of that white region is desertNow imagine that region full of trees and wildlife! Imagine big nature parks, image billions of insects, imagine millions of animals living thereA further challenge is that a lot of animals might be harmed in such a terra-forming attempt, animals that have evolved to make use of the desert conditions. But don’t forget that human activity is responsible for much of the wildlife extinction, we are causing global warming that is destroying ecosystems all over the world, and simply by giving out much more desalinated water humans are just going to reconstruct what we ourselves destroyed!Existing exampleIn 1979, Payeng, then 16, encountered a large number of snakes that had died due to excessive heat after floods washed them onto the tree-less sandbar. That is when he planted around 20 bamboo seedlings on the sandbar.He started working on the forest in 1979 when the social forestry division ofThe forest, which came to be known as Molai forest, now housesThere are several thousand trees, including valcol, arjun (A herd of around 100 elephants regularly visits the forest every year and generally stay for around six months. They have given birth to 10 calves in the forest in recent years.Please Note:But THAT is a bigger hypothetical scenario than electrical power becoming cheap (as it has gotten for decades, through small iterative improvements or through big revolutionary improvements — fusion, anyone?!), so I’ll stay with my hypothesis.Also, please note that this is not a legally binding letter of statement. This is not a complete solution, this is not the only way, this is not going to solve everything. There might be other factual problems with this answer, and hence all this might never happen.

People often discount the negative aspects but more importantly, the negatives are not always readily apparent.Pollution is the addition of materials to the environment in amounts greater than nature can handle. Nothing is automatically a pollutant and everything has the potential to be so. If you're chomping on a jawbreaker in your front yard and your teeth shatter off a piece which goes flying off into the grass, you have not polluted. If the jawbreaker factory next door explodes and hundreds of pounds of lawbreakers land in your front yard, you have a pollution problem. So while a yard full of jawbreakers is obviously an issue, if your child spills his jawbreakers in the grass, you may never notice.That is the crux of the problem. Back when the industrial revolution started, nobody realized what the negatives would be. Over time we suspected that what ended up in our streams was a problem but the stream carried it away. It wasn't until drinking water supplies were affected that we realized we were in trouble. This process of discovery took decades and it also took considerable time to correct as well.While this process still happens, we're much more aware of the consequences of change. Because of this, the cycle of discovering and correcting the negatives occurs much quicker. So while all changes, including technology, results in negatives, any pollution and environmental damage is usually corrected very quickly.","5,360 followers",Valerio Cietto,677,2.4K,9.1M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-role-of-advanced-technology-in-the-degradation-of-the-environment

Do you think this is true and is there any way around it?Answer:It is entirely reasonable to argue that improved technology leads to greater efficiency and greatly reduced damage to the environment. And there is a lot of truth to this statement. Coal fired heating and steam engines, for example, caused far more damage than solar panels, wind farms, and renewable energy.But technological advancement has come hand in glove with two other major consequences:Population Growth.In 1900 Global human population was 1 billion people.But improved technology, particularly in heath care, meant that the millions of children who died before even reaching adulthood - lived.Global population is now pushing towards 8 billion.Certainly this was made possible by technological advances, but it didn’t have to be this way. Technology also gave us contraception and the pill, as well as improved education.Countries such as China, Bangladesh and Russia have managed their populations.But Western Civilisation has done nothing to manage or praise population control. Countries such as India, Pakistan and Indonesia have massive population increases still continuing. Iran’s population increases are terrifying. And South America has also done little to reduce population growth rates.Of course religions which preach that contraception is a bad thing (or that women must not practice it without the consent of their husbands) are a major factor in this. And the Holy Roman Catholic church is guilty (yes ‘guilty’ is the appropriate word, and I am a Christian) of this too.So while it is true that technology has facilitated the population explosion, it also facilitated population planning, but most of mankind’s governments. influenced by Western Civilization and irresponsible religions, have done little to tackle the problem.Improved Standards of Living.There’s a lot to be said for raising living standards, and I am no fan of the supposed virtues of poverty. Advances in technology have made huge improvements in increasing living standards for billions of people around the world.But improved living standards generally come at the price of diverting more of the world’s resources to human beings’ improved conditions.ConclusionImproved technology leads to improved efficiency, and less environmental impact for given outputs.Improved technology has enabled human population numbers to increase eightfold in 120 years, and this requires eight times as many people to be fed, clothed, housed, etc. This inevitably leads to more land being taken over for farming and human dwellings, which in turn results in ‘destruction of species habitat’ for other species - causing mass extinctions.Improved technology has led to more people having a better quality of life, with more and better food, better accomodation, clothing, transport, education, entertainment, etc.In 1900 nobody was in the air. In 2019 over 1 million people are in the air at any one time. Many of these are tourists, enjoying the quality of life to visit far away places in luxury and comfort. Cruise liners do the same. All these things have major negative environmental impacts.Better technology is the best thing that can happen for the environment, provided human beings reduce their population and everyone stops wanting to live the way the wealthiest 10% of the USA lives. One doesn’t have to travel as a tourist - one can simply watch travel documentaries, or have 3D Virtual Reality experiences at home. These things barely damage the environment at all. But - no, everyone wants the experience of ‘being there’.Is that the fault of advanced technology?Hope this helps.","1,594 followers",Michael Van In,631,1.5K,2.9M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-role-of-advanced-technology-in-the-degradation-of-the-environment

You could even argue it happened much earlier than that. The north/south split was a major and long lasting issue dating back to our founding.The split was so severe that dating back to 1830s, members of Congress would arm themselves on the Senate floor out of genuine fear of getting attacked. This was 30 years before the war. Senators genuinely felt another senator may try to kill him. We have members of Congress bringing arms to Washington today, but it's not the same. They are doing it for optics. They don't genuinely believe Nancy Pelosi or Mitch McConnell are going to shoot them from the dais.This came to a head in 1856 where one member of the house tried to kill a senator. He beat him within inches of his life.We play it off today as quippy anecdote. LOL those silly senators. This is because we're so far removed from that setting that it's impossible for us to genuinely believe this was an attempted murder.During the attack, Charles Sumner was unable to see because he was blinded by the amount of blood flowing over his face. He was eventually knocked unconscious. The other guy continued to beat him anyway.This wasn’t a the result of a temper tantrum. It wasn't some random act. He came there that day to walk up and kill him. He chose a cane because it would be far more humiliating. He was correct, fact it was a cane is exactly why we don't take this event seriously today.The attacker’s allies on the Senate floor even formed a blockade around the two. They were brandishing pistols and threatened to shoot anyone who tried to intervene as pleaded to spare his life. We nearly had a full blown gunfight between congressmen.Eventually, some of Sumner’s allies were able to break through the wall. Cooler heads prevailed, no shots were fired, and the situation didn’t escalate. By this point Sumner's unconscious body was beaten so much the cane had broken into several pieces. This wasn't a simple stick. It was a genuine club with a metal top. One of the many errors in the political cartoon above is it depicts him holding the metal top and striking with the wood. All accounts of the event agree he was striking Sumner over the head with the metal portion of the cane.Sumner survived but needed three years to recover. It is suspected that he suffered brain inquiries. His attacker had to pay a fine and even got reelected.Sumners opponents made commemorative rings out of the broken cane. They proudly wore these on the Senate floor. The man who almost killed him was given many more canes afterward as tokens of appreciation and encouragement. He not only escaped punishment but people thanked him for nearly killing a fellow member of Congress on the Senate floor.The conditions that allowed this outrageous event to take place were quite extreme. Yet, we were still five years away from civil war.A review of the history of the American government and you’ll see that the US was fending off civil war for many decades before it actually happened. Many of the actions of our government in the hundred years leading up the war was about finding solutions to prevent the country from splitting. Most people in government who were either attempting to start or prevent a civil war were deceased by the time the war began. None of the people who fought the war were alive when the possiblity of one first came to light.Looking at things now, yes it looks quite bad. The situation is certainly much worse than 20–30 years ago. This makes a lot of people scream for the hills with “zomg civil war is on the horizon.” It’s not. We’re not even close. What happened was we’d gotten along so unusually and atypically well for such a long time that we’ve lost perspective.This is the norm. Our founding fathers drank heavily and regularly got in fights with each other. They slandered each other in the press. Not just on policy but personal attacks as well. When Burr killed Hamilton in a duel, Burr was the standing Vice President and Hamilton was our top military officer. That's the equivalent of Kamala Harris killing the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.It's just insane how the US was the truly the wild wild west even before the wild wild west. Andrew Jackson also killed many people in duels. Hamilton's son was killed in a duel as well. Nor were they even polite to each other. When John Adams was president, his rivals openly addressed him as a fatass at formal occasions. Can you imagine if Obama introduced Trump at his inauguration as President Fatass? That's just an impossibility today but used to be the norm.We’re also nowhere close to the kind of strife and disunity found in the decades leading up to the civil war. Civil War doesn’t come out of anywhere. It requires lengthy animosity to drive people to both take opposing sides as well as happily take up arms against each other.We have our issues, but they are standard issues. Even if enough of the population wanted to fight each other today, which sides would they be on? Where would they be located? There's no geographic majorities anywhere in the US. California and Texas are as divided as the US itself is. Maybe that kind of solidarity can happen. But you gotta remember there was a clear divide of slave vs non slave states in the civil war that doesn't exist anymore.Getting a lot of comments where people claim were still on the verge of war but they aren't accounting for logistics. Take California. While they vote about 60% democrat, most people choose not to vote. Recent polls have only 49% of the population identifying with the Democratic party. So let's say all 49% of those people felt strongly enough about their beliefs to kill other Americans (spoiler, they don't) and start a civil war.Well then they'd have to imprison or kill at least 1/3 of their state government officials. They'd also have to suppress their own population. They'd have their hands full with deportations and internment camps.Their water is pumped in from Colorado and their electricity comes from the national grid. So they'd first have to solve their own water and electricity issues. Which they wouldn't be able to do, at least not without a good decade of preparation. There's so many dependencies from businesses to food distribution that California would look post apocalyptic within a month of declaring independence. Most businesses would fall, many others would leave. Nor did California have their own military nor the capacity to create one on the fly.People who believe we’re on the verge of civil war need to read more history and gain some better perspective. Maybe if things continue, it could lead to some civil unrest but not civil war. Historians could perhaps look at this period as the beginning stages of a civil war. But that war would be so far in the future most of us won’t be alive to witness it.","5,990 followers",Jens Böttiger,566,2.6K,17.6M,2021,https://www.quora.com/If-another-major-war-broke-out-would-all-the-advanced-technology-be-the-first-things-to-fail-like-some-people-say

Renewable Energy is a scam-taxpayer's money for Phony Capitalists & political campaigns.Add all the money in the world spent on renewables and there would no longer be any use of coal, oil or gas to generate electricity. And add the money wasted on the U.S. Dept. of Energy, the Nuclear Reg. Commission and on trying to develop fusion and I bet the world would have so much power that people would never have to turn the lights off. Except in a few cases, all transportation would be electrified and not need to use batteries.About ½ of the energy generated is presently wasted.

The State of California, with all their political power and a California Democrat, Chet Holifield, got the head researcher, Alvin Weinberg, fired and President John F. Kennedy removed funding. Obama was the last to impede progress by vetoing Republican legislation that would force the bureaucrats to act on approving the MSR's. Obama supported the MSR's but said the U.S. technology should be given to Foreign countries.Join us in asking President Trump & Congress to defund the two agencies mentioned above (Other countries are in the process of approving the MSR’s; the U.S. can use those approvals) (the NRC has had 60 years to approve the MSR’s- another 10 years & billions of $$$$ that they demand will all be wasted).The U.S. military needs to order at least 6 MSR’s for military bases to kick-start the industry.","1,441 followers",Knowledge Bank,6.7K,117,161.9K,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-role-of-advanced-technology-in-the-degradation-of-the-environment

The question becomes which consequences and which risks do we now, and will we in the future, find acceptable.Fire can burn you (and your possessions), coal and petroleum products can produce disease and pollution, nuclear power can make entire swaths of the Earth dangerous to inhabit, wind power installations can deplete bird life and affect the weather downwind, Solar power requires dedication of large swaths of land that can not be otherwise utilized, tidal power generates interference with sea life, and so on.The thing is, energy is useless unless you have a path fr it to follow that allows you to extract work from it.This is why dreams of tapping “zero point energy” are just dreams… until we find somewhere to “ground it out” in electrical engineering terms.The vacuum of spacetime is not empty- it seethes with more energy per cubic meter than we can put to use right now, tens of millions of times as much as the entire Earth now uses in a year.Vacuum energy - WikipediaThe problem is that all of space and all of time seem to be at the same potential. I’s like only having one terminal of a powerful battery available- you can’t complete a circuit to extract work from the battery.Until we invent a technology to solve that little riddle we will be unable to access what is probably the ultimate energy source possible in this universe and will have to make do with lesser ones.Good thing too- depleting the energy of the vacuum has its own theoretical negative consequences to risk, like collapsing the vacuum to a state in which matter as we know it could not exist.False vacuum - Wikipedia",0 followers,Hatice Aslan,570,164,11.7M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-role-of-advanced-technology-in-the-degradation-of-the-environment

We might switch over to all electric using nuclear reactors to produce the electricity but there are problems with that….besides the resistance to rapid and widespread use of reactors. This would require all forms of transportation to change over to electric motors. That means every one of the 1+ billion cars in the world would have to be destroyed and replaced with new electric cars. That is a cost that most countries - including the US - cannot afford in the short term.A much better fuel choice would be one that could be retrofitted into gasoline cars during a protracted phase-out of 4-cycle engines and into electric motors. This is also true of the heating of homes and offices, the fuel needed to produce electricity and most other forms of energy production. Unless we can do that, there will be a much greater disruption in our economy and in related energy and transportation industries that will make the transition into a new fuel much more expensive, difficult and take much longer.Essentially, we need a new fuel :that can directly replace oilthat does not pollute,can be retrofitted into most oil burning devices and facilities,can be produced cheaply andcomes from a natural resource that is abundant and easily accessed.There is such a fuel. Hydrogen.FUEL:We are headed toward what is called a “hydrogen economy”. As an alternative to fossil fuel, Hydrogen (H) is the ONLY fuel we now know of that meets these three requirements:USE:There are limits to hydrogen because it does have a lower energy density than oil. It would have very limited application in aviation and in large vessel shipping and trucking. For those, we would have to rely on fossil fuels until we can design either electric or other fuels that could be used.Hydrogen can be used to burn as a primary fuel for heating and vehicle power. It can be produced from water and when it burned, its exhaust is water. A pipeline or truck leaking hydrogen would not be an environmental disaster because hydrogen is a natural part of out atmosphere. It can also be used in a fuel cell to produce electricity. Fuel cell powered cars are already on the market with as much range and fill-ups as fast as gasoline cars.PRODUCTION:Producing H from water, compressing it into a liquid and using a reactor to produce it makes H a viable (and right now, the only) fuels that can replace fossil fuels and coal.Making H on an industrial scale using electrolysis is not practical but it can also be made by a process called “cracking” which heats water high enough that the molecules split up into H and O2. The heat needed is high but it can be achieved with some newer designed nuclear reactors such as the Pebble Bed Reactor (PBR).A PBR power plant can last for up to 40 years. The PBR fuel “pebbles” are cycled continuously and replaced, as needed, without shutting down the plant for refueling. This means that it is technically not a renewable energy source but 40 years is long enough that for all practical purposes, it is renewable.PRODUCTION FACILITY:A typical H production facility would consist of a PBR or some other 5th Gen VHTR (such as molten salt thorium reactor) located near a large water source such as an ocean. It would create electrical power in the usual way (PBR’s use helium (an inert gas) instead of steam as the primary heated media). The heat of the reactor would also be used to “crack” some of the water into H and O2. A lesser amount of the heat would be used to desalinate the sea water. The electricity produced by the PBR would power the entire process and the facility but would also be used to compress the H into a liquid and put it into liquid H storage tanks, trucks and/or to pump it thru underground pipelines - similar to those used to transport natural gas today.Initially, to reduce social resistance to the use of nuclear reactors, it might be necessary to build the H production facilities in remote areas but near water such as Baja, Mexico or Hudson Bay or Newfoundland and pipe or ship the liquid H back to distribution facilities. As the safety of PBRs is established, they could be built along any coast or around the Great Lakes.There are loses in the cracking of H - it takes more energy into the process than we can get out of the H as energy to do work later. This means that if you only look at the net energy input versus the net energy output, then this is not a practical process. However, if we gain the H energy by being able to use the produced energy in new applications then it is worth it. For instance - we can’t use nuclear reactors in cars but we can use H. A PBR is one of the few designs called a Very High Temperature Reactor (VHTR) that is efficient enough to make H with a net loss of energy but with a net gain in cost. This is because a single load of PBR reactor fuel will produce H for years.If the reactor can operate for a very long time on an infrequent fuel load (thorium) , then from a monetary perspective, it is profitable, i.e., the sale and use of the cracked H is higher than the cost of the PBR’s refueling.The output of the PBR facility would be large volumes of liquid H, large volumes of O2 as a compressed gas, fresh water made out of salt water, and electricity.That it takes a PBR or other VHTR to crack water into H is really no different than using an oil refinery to make fossil fuels - except that a H-cracking refinery would have almost no pollution, would use an unlimited resource of raw material (water) and would produce a fuel that, when burned, would return to being water.Given the hydrogen production capacity of a PBR or other VHTR reactor over its lifetime and the costs of the fuel used versus the value and sales cost of the hydrogen produced, it makes no difference that the net energy in is less than the net energy out.See more details about cost of a PBR at the end of this articleDISTRIBUTION:Since the PBR’s reactor is used to make steam to power electricity production. That electricity can then be used to power the equipment to compress the H into liquid form so it can be concentrated and transported to and thru distribution methods - pipes, trucks and into car tanks. The H is then used in other power plants to make steam for electricity without the pollution that coal or oil would make,It is a serious error and an impediment to progress to draw strict conclusions about potential solutions by using strict definitions or arbitrary limits on those possible solutions. A nuclear reactor that can operate non-stop for 40 years or more is essentially a renewable resource as long as there is a source for the raw material that makes up the fuel (uranium, thorium, etc.). Certainly a breeder reactor is renewable since it produces waste that is usable fuel in other reactors. When we perfect fusion reactors, they will be essentially renewable because they might be able to operate for as much as 50 to 75 years.This is actually not much different than a solar power plant. A significantly greater unusable energy (sunlight) is put into the process than usable energy taken out. The sunlight is unusable in the sense that it is not dense or powerful enough to power a car or heat a house or operate an electric power production facility. If enough solar panels are added together, it becomes more usable but that is impractical for vehicles without the ability to accumulate and store the solar produced electricity. We consider this renewable because we are using the renewable energy of sunlight.The efficiency and low cost of nuclear powered heat and electricity and the long intervals and relatively low cost of the fuel, is not the same as but is similar to the energy we get from sunlight. That heat and electrical energy is then used to create a more usable and transportable fuel. Using a VHTR or PBR in place of the sunlight is not the same but it is many orders of magnitude better than using fossil fuels or coal with multiple additional benefits - no pollution, much smaller footprint, lower overall cost, etc.When you consider that almost all transportation, all industrial uses, all home heating and cooling and all related forms of electricity production can be powered by Hydrogen, it is a logical choice to replace oil. Given that 7/10th of the earth is covered in water, that burning hydrogen gives off no pollutants and we have a viable method of producing the hydrogen without burning any other polluting fuel to get it, it is the ideal solution to our energy needs.PBRs and other 5th Gen VHT Reactor Designs:There will be those that argue that nuclear power is actually very expensive but it really makes a big difference how you create your statistics and charts. PBR’s, for instance, can be made so that 5 of them will fit on a football field with room left for parking. They are small enough that they the reactor core can be built off-site and trucked to where it will be used. They use 1/10th the plumbing of the currently used design. They do not require any cooling towers. The core heats helium gas directly which is then used to heat water for the generator but because helium is an inert gas, it cannot and does not become radioactive. There is also a quirk in the physics of using the “pebble” design (actually tennis ball size) such that if the reactor core rises about 1,600 degrees, it will automatically shut itself down, , i.e., it cannot overheat, melt down, or go “critical” like today’s reactors. It is also nearly impossible to make weapon’s grade fuel from the reactors depleted fuel pebbles.This design makes for a very efficient and low cost reactor with low maintenance, a small footprint, nearly zero pollution and as safe as it is possible to get. This all translate to avery low net cost over time and when considering the amount of power it creates.I find that the most honest values of cost come when you consider ALL expenses over as long a period as possible. A “total life cycle cost” gives a good estimate of the end cost to the consumer but it is difficult because not all production sources can last for the same length of time. Here is one chart that attempts to do this and is the one that the US and IEA accept as the definitive quantification of production costs.To be considered valid and usable, it is important to recite the fine print of how these numbers were produced. Here it is:Total Life-Cycle Costs for Electricity, normalized to capacity factor, life-span and amount of energy produced. Costs include construction, operation and maintenance (O&M), fuel, and decommissioning. Costs do not include electrical grid upgrade, transportation issues, connectivity of renewables and buffering of their intermittency by rapid cycling of fossil fuel plants as presently practiced in this country, and externalities such as any carbon-tax, pollution and health care costs associated with energy production and use. Also, these costs are not levelized but are actual direct costs. Once actual costs are known, better long-term planning can be done and some levelizing factors can be wisely shaped to affect a more desirable energy mix.Costs not captured include electrical grid upgrade, connectivity of renewables and buffering of their intermittency by rapid cycling of fossil fuel plants as presently practiced in this country, and non-carbon-tax externalities such as pollution and health care costs associated with energy sources, especially for coal. Costs for coal are highly dependent on the cost of gasoline, and the costs for wind are highly dependent on material costs like steel and concrete as wind requires about 10 times the amount of steel, concrete and copper per kWhr than any other energy source. These, in turn, are also highly dependent on the cost of gasoline. All decommissioning and waste disposal costs are relatively small compared to other costs, 0.1¢/kWhr or less, even for nuclear. Costs of a carbon tax @$15/ton of CO2 emitted are significant for the fossil fuels over this time period but, on their own, are still insufficient to force any change in fossil fuel use, or the total mix of sources adopted by a nation.If you read this carefully, almost all the things NOT captured in the above graph would significantly ADD to the costs of the fuels except for nuclear which would add very little.","5,360 followers",Valerio Cietto,677,2.4K,9.1M,2018,https://www.quora.com/If-another-major-war-broke-out-would-all-the-advanced-technology-be-the-first-things-to-fail-like-some-people-say
