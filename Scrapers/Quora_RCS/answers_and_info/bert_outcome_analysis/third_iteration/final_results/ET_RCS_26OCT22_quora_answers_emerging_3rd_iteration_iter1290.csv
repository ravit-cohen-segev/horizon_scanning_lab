That is when real change will be seen.Virtual tribes (if I may say so) can be created around chains and currencies but they don’t foster a sense of identity and hence are ineffective tools to create cohesive groups of believers. For example .. people who believe in Bitcoin can be labeled as “Bitcoin believers” but this identity is opportunistic, and cannot stand the test of time like identities fostered around religion or flag.Now, anarchists and at times futurists live in a bubble of their own, an alternate universe, and traverse the universe with their thought experiments. Those thought experiments fall flat when they come in contact with social and political orders.Blockchain is a data structure. One single way of organizing and sharing information. Today, blockchain is a placeholder term that implies “transparency” and “broker-less” environment. Well, it is like saying all evils of the world are because of these two limitations.

In the last few centuries, non-biological flight was achieved through human technology, and soon far surpassed biology.

To fully emulate the function of one neuron you need about the same processing power as one laptop of today. On supercomputer level, we are getting close to the processing power that would be needed to recreate the function of a human brain in real time. Around mid-century, in past trends hold, this kind of processing power should be quite trivial — about as common as a smartphone of today.And there is no reason to stop with emulations of a mere 86 billion neurons.

This is true for three reasons: (i) mental health has reached crisis status, (ii) mental health is a booming area of medical research with high levels of tech transfer from academic labs, and (iii) brain technology is benefiting greatly from tech advances in other fields.Mental Health Crisis1 in 5 American adults experience a mental illness.The prevailing theory used to posit that alleviating socioeconomic hardships would drive down all diseases; while this is true for many diseases of the last century, by virtue of longer life-spans other diseases have emerged, most famously: dementia. Other mental health challenges are also on the rise—Those suffering from Autism Spectral Disorder make up approximately 1 in 132 individuals (and growing)Biomedical Research: Focus on the BrainIn 2011 nearly a quarter of the National Institutes of Health $32B budget went to ‘neurosciences’ related projects.While some areas of basic research have legitimate reasons to complain about stagnating funding, medical research cannot. The NIH currently provides 50% greater funding than it did in the year 2000. Much of this growth has occurred in brain research. That being said, it is also easy to say that it isn’t enough to meet the demand and needs of those afflicted with debilitating disease. When the quality of life of 1 in 5 humans is on the line, mental health issues should continue to take a front and center position among public policy issues. That is all I will say about the politics of biomedical research right now—I promise.Many technologies are developing which, if successful, could have an immediate and massive impact on the treatment of brain disorders. One such device takes advantage of microarrays of stimulating electrodes to mimic the communication that occurs between populations of neurons in the brain. There are several examples of these types of devices already in the marketplace, including: cochlear implants, retinal implants, deep brain stimulation, and a proposed hippocampal prosthesis.There is hardly a science fiction book that hasn’t tried to imagine what part of the human experience couldn’t be improved by having a better understanding of our own brains. While the task of healing a sick brain is daunting due to the sheer complexity and inaccessibility of our brains, the benefits of doing so are incalculable.

The pollution of cities and a large percentage of greenhouse gas emissions will have been eliminated.As a button shows, I received some time ago, a brief summary of some innovations that, as a prediction, offer us an inexorable future in progress. I think your reading is very appropriate because it speaks precisely of what you are interested in knowing. This brief summary talks about the rest of your days.1- The auto repair shops will disappear.2- The gasoline / diesel engine contains 20,000 car components. An electric motor has only twenty. Electric cars are sold with a lifetime warranty and are only repaired by dealers. It only takes 10 minutes to remove and replace a new electric motor.3- Defective electric motors will not be repaired at the dealer's workshop, but will be sent to a municipal or regional repair shop where robots and intelligent systems will repair them.4- When a light comes on that indicates a malfunction of the electric motor, you can drive it to a place where besides a car wash station there will be a place where, while you have a good coffee, your car will be equipped with a new electric motor.5- The service stations will disappear or become electric charging stations, slow or fast, for all types of vehicles.6- All the edges of the sidewalks of the streets and the public and private parking lots will have electric recharging points. The companies will install electric charging stations that, in fact, are already installed in cities where they have already begun their transition to electric mobility, such as Oslo, Amsterdam, Paris, San Francisco, San Jose, San Diego, Shanghai, Beijing, Shenzhen, Montreal, Portland, etc., among others.7- The main manufacturers of road vehicles have already allocated funds to start building new plants where only electric cars are manufactured.8- The coal industries will disappear. The oil companies will leave. The oil drilling will stop. So say goodbye to OPEC. The Middle East will get into trouble.9- There are already ZEB technologies,10- A baby born within a decade will not see gasoline cars more than in museums.The FUTURE is moving faster than most of us can handle.11- In 1998, Kodak employed 170,000 people and sold 85% of all the photographic papers in the world. In just a few years, their business model disappeared and they went bankrupt. Who would have thought that this would happen one day?12- What happened with Kodak and Polaroid will happen with many companies in the next 5 to 10 years ... and most people do not see it coming. Volkswagen will no longer have any other opportunity to cheat.13- Did you think in 1998, that three years later, you would never take photos in a movie camera? Did you buy a digital camera? Nowadays, with smartphones, who has a digital camera to take pictures, if we have smart phones?14- Even when digital cameras were invented in 1975. The first digital camera only had 10,000 pixels, but they followed Moore's law. Then, as with all exponential technologies, it was a disappointment for a while, before taking off and becoming the only camera reference in the market, and it did so in just a few years.15- Now this pace of innovations or more will happen again - but this time everything will happen much faster - thanks to Artificial Intelligence applied to commercial sales, to artificial intelligence applications in professional activities such as intelligent health systems systems, to autonomous and electric automobiles, to education assisted by Artificial Intelligence, to 3D printing, to intelligent agriculture and to jobs based on Shared Intelligence, SI, which will modify the generic competences of workers.16- Do not forget to read the books17- The intelligent software has penetrated and will continue to penetrate most of the traditional sectors, during the next 3 to 10 years.18- The UBER platform is just a software tool, they do not have cars and now it is the largest taxi company in the world.19- Airbnb is now the largest digital hotel platform in the world, although they do not own an apartment.20-21- In the United States, young lawyers can no longer find work. With22- The23- Facebook now has a form recognition software that is able to recognize faces better than humans. By 2030, computers will be smarter in the vast majority of jobs than humans. Only human-machine collaborative work based on SI (Shared Intelligence) will have a future.24- Autonomous cars: in 2018, the first autonomous electric vehicles began to circulate in some parts of the United States. In the coming years, we will see how the entire automotive industry will begin to be affected. In about five years or sooner, you will not have to own a car, in addition to shared electric vehicles, you can also call a car with your phone, it will appear at your location and take you to your destination.25- You do not need to park the autonomous electric car, you will pay only the distance traveled and you can work or rest while driving. Many of today's youngest children will never have a driver's license and will not own a car either. The public transport, the shared electric car and the autonomous taxi will make it possible.26- This deployment will change our cities because we will need from 90% to 95% fewer cars on the streets before the end of the century. Thus, cities will be able to convert old parking spaces into pedestrian zones and green parks.27- Around 1.2 million people die each year, worldwide as a result of traffic accidents, even distracted or intoxicated. Now we have an accident every 62,137 miles; Thanks to autonomous driving, the accident rate will be reduced, becoming: an accident every ten million km. This ratio will save an extra million lives every year in the world.28- Most traditional vehicle manufacturers will surely go bankrupt. They will try to give you an evolutionary approach or they will simply build a better car, while the technology companies (Tesla, Apple, Google) will give you the revolutionary approach and build autonomous cars as if they were computers with wheels.29- Observing what the vast majority of the world's car manufacturers are doing now. As of this years, Volvo will not manufacture more cars with internal combustion engines. All 2019 models, all will be exclusively electric or hybrid, with the aim of eliminating hybrid models.30- Many Volkswagen and Audi engineers are completely terrified by Tesla and should be. There is more to observe all the companies that already offer electric vehicles. Something that was unheard of just a few years ago.31- The insurance companies will have big problems because, since without accidents, the costs will become much cheaper. The model of your car insurance will disappear.32- Real estate will change. Because if you can work while traveling, people will leave their towers to settle in more beautiful and affordable neighborhoods in the periphery.33- Cities will be less noisy and will not pollute the environment because all new cars will run on electricity.34- The cities will also look much healthier.35- The electricity will be incredibly cheap and clean.36- Solar energy and wind energy have known an exponential growth curve during the last 30 years, but now we can see the impact will be increasing. Fossil energies will be banned.37- Fossil energy companies are desperately trying to limit access to the network to avoid competition from domestic solar installations, but this abuse that undermines freedom of trade, simply can not continue because non-fossil technologies are much more competitive38- Health: The price of Tricorder X will go down a lot. Currently, there are companies that manufacture a medical device (called Star Trek Tricorder) that will work with your phone, which will take your retinal scanner, your blood sample and the rhythm of your breathing. Currently there are more than 70 biomarkers capable of identifying almost all diseases. There are also dozens of telephone applications available now for health reasons.39-Today, in the case of a gasoline vehicle, the sum of the weight of a 15-gallon gasoline tank (110.2 lbs, 45 kWh efficient) and the weight of the induction motor is 837.8 lbs. The total weight represents a total weight of 948 lbs. On the other hand, in the case of the electric vehicle, the weight of the batteries of a 60 kWh electric car is 882 lbs and if we add the weight of an electric motor of 67 lbs. The total also represents approximately 948 lbs. Which means that vehicles have the same energy density. The same would start to happen with commercial airliners.40. At present, substantial improvements have already been made with respect to the increase in the energy density of batteries for airplanes, which will grow between 5 and 8% per year. This means that we can achieve that this ambitious objective, consisting of the fact that the kerosene planes capable of transporting 150 passengers up to a distance of about 683.5 miles were all electric, would be fulfilled at the beginning of the 2040s decade. The biokerosene could be used in larger aircraft, until the technology allowed to use only electric batteries aided by the electrical generation from solar energy.WELCOME TO TOMORROW: although, in fact, it arrived a few years ago.Let's wake up with the desire to prepare for the future, so that the challenges of the 21st century do not surprise us as usual. Instead of strangling us with narrow thoughts, which prevent us from adapting to changes in a non-traumatic way, it is necessary to eliminate unnecessary obstacles in the spirit. We need to be owners of our future and thus enjoy our world as a better place that will allow all human beings to find the lost paradise.","135,501 followers",Hector Quintanilla,582,1.2K,88.5M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-can-I-study-next-after-a-BSc-in-radiation-therapy-technology
