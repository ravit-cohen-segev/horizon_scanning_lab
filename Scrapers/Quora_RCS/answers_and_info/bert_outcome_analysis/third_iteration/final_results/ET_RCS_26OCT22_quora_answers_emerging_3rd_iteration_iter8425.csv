Previous ships running Harriers were much shorter.Next up is brakes (or lack of) on the Harrier. The running joke about the Harrier is it don’t need brakes (they are much an afterthought!!). Because the Harrier did not have computer controlled anti-lock brakes, and to save weight ONLY the tiny little front nose wheel can supply braking power. This is done not only to save weight, but in case the pilot locks up the brakes. If you lock up just the front nose wheel, then the jet does not spin out of control. (Simple slides rather straight ahead). With rear brakes, then locking up on wet decks could cause a spin. If computer anti-lock breaks were available on the Harrier, then they likely would have adopted rolling landings.So with wet decks, and shorter decks, it was simply too dangerous for the Harrier to use rolling landings. It also why ONLY that tiny little front wheel on the Harrier provides all the stopping power. It really is poor, but then again, the Harrier really don’t need a lot of stopping power - it can land VERY slow . So on regular runways, they can and do use rolling landings - it thus requires little brakes to stop the Harrrier.With the F35B, you have 3 point computer controlled anti-skid breaking. So it can’t spin, and has full anti-lock brakes, and has them on all 3 wheels.In fact a long time Harrier pilot recently wrote British parliament warning against using rolling landings since with rain, bouncing decks and equipment on the deck, he stated that rolling landings are a disaster waiting to happen. You slide into a row of F35’s on deck, and you have real mess! What if you slide into equipment? What about sliding into the tower? So it is a significant worry and issue.However, I don’t think this pilot realizes how amazing and controllable the F35B is.So, here is a rolling landing. Should we brace for impact? Should we write parliament? Should we call mommy?Is this going to be oh so beyond dangerous?Well, we were all on pins and needles as to how well (or bad) this concept would work. Get out some popcorn.Here is the video of the first such landing on the new HMS Q:Ready?Are you all scared?Hang on to your pants!!Brace for impact!!!!Wow, was that easy or what?So due to computer controls on the F35B, this type of landing is now deemed to be operational safe. And this type of landing will increase the return fuel and payloads by 2000 lbs. As a result the total return store rating will be 7,000 lbs. The F35B is rated for 5,000 lbs return store rating in 100% vertical landing mode. The Harrier is famous for having littered the ocean floor with un-spent bombs,and having to dump fuel before a return landing on a ship. With the F35, even 100% vertical payloads are very good (double the Harrier). And with rolling landings, then even higher return store payloads will be permitted. As a general rule, you match the fuel loads and bomb loads to EXACT the mission. However, with this setup, they can add extra fuel for more afterburner time, or more time on station, but if such fuel etc. is not used, then they can return the F35 to the ship without having to dump expensive weapons.Keep in mind that 5,000 lbs is a great return store rating. A legacy F18 on a super-carrier is only rated for 4,000 lbs. So they face the same issue in terms of limiting fuel and weapons on a return ship landing. The new super Hornets fixed this huge shortcoming of the original F18. So the return store rating for a Super Hornet is in the 8,000 lbs range now.As the above video shows? Really easy - a walk in the part to land this way. However, with wind, rain, and large return payloads, slippery decks? Well, it may well that depending on how bad the weather is, they may well have to return back to the 100% hover over the deck and land mode. So a rolling landing is a great idea, as it increases return store loads, reduces hover time (increases rate of returning fighters).so this idea was not really used with Harriers, but with better brakes, larger decks, and a computer stabilized jet like the F35 B, this type of landing process will be part of regular operations on the HMS Q. I would like to see how well this works in a real storm and rain scenario, but it is a workable concept now.",4 followers,Mike Milne,987,117,879.3K,2020,https://www.quora.com/Will-a-shipborne-rolling-vertical-landing-SRVL-actually-work-for-an-F-35B-landing-of-HMS-Queen-Elizabeth

The UK decided against the Catapult Assisted Take Off But Arrested Recovery (CATOBAR) version, the F-35C, because the QE class don’t have a ready supply of steam for steam catapults and electromagnetic catapults have serious problems at the present time, although they could be retro-fitted in the future. The F-35Bs were selected to meet the current requirements of the RN in terms of sortie rate, weapon capacity, range and pilot training by people far more experienced than the OP and will provide a very competent capability, which will meet the UK’s needs.

It’s smart management to buy the best equipment available to protect the lives of your men-at-arms. If that equipment comes from another ally then fine. It makes more sense to save your R&D dollars (and pounds) for new designs to fit other requirements rather than trying to ‘reinvent the wheel’ and create a new design to fill a requirement that’s already met by an existing design.That’s just good integration with allies.List of active United States Marine Corps aircraft squadrons - WikipediaWhy the Marines Love the Old Harrier JetMarines have been flying the Harrier jet for over 30 years — here's why they still keep it aroundConsolidated B-24 Liberator - WikipediaRolls-Royce Mustang Mk.X - WikipediaNorth American P-51 Mustang - WikipediaAmericans in the RCAFEagle Squadrons",635 followers,Dominik Schachtsiek,1K,3.3K,4.4M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Will-a-shipborne-rolling-vertical-landing-SRVL-actually-work-for-an-F-35B-landing-of-HMS-Queen-Elizabeth

There wasn’t much detail about genetic changes to turn them into Superhumans (although that *did* come quite shortly after, as it’s covered in one of the first ever supplements) other than some bio-chem enhancements and the black carapace allowing them to interface with their armour. There’s even a full-page piece of artwork featuring “Imperial Commander” Marneus Calgar, Lord Macragge, Each chapter was led by an Imperial Commander, as opposed to a Chapter Master. Chapters were still limited to 1000 fighting marines. Colour schemes and iconography for a few of the chapters we know today were introduced, including the Blood Angels, Ultramarines, Space Wolves, Crimson Fists, Iron Hands, White Scars (“Whitescars” at the time) and Dark Angels.The Imperium stood pretty much as it does now, with the corpse-Emperor on the Throne powering the Astronomican, and being kept alive by the sacrifice of many psykers daily. However, the lore about the Horus Heresy came later (in one of the two Realms of Chaos volumes, if I remember correctly) - and even then, Horus was just an Imperial Commander, not a Primarch yet. The Emperor was confined to his Throne due to the strain of ten thousand years of building the Imperium and holding off psychic threats from warp space taking its toll on his body.There was an Adeptus Mechanicus (although no mention of Mars - in fact they’re referred to as the “guardians of Earth’s ancient technogical past”), Adeptus Custodes (although they wore pointy helmets and cloaks, not power armor), Adeptus Arbites, Adeptus Astronomica, Adeptus Astra Telepathica, Legiones Astartes, Imperial Army, Imperial Navy, Rogue Traders, Inquisition, etc.As there hadn’t been a Horus Heresy, the concept that would become Chaos Marines was just Traitor Marines that’d gone rogue, becoming pirates and suchlike. Something that was far more likely then as their indoctrination process hadn’t been defined.The Eye of Terror is still mentioned, as a dangerous part of space that you don’t want to get too close to.Abhumans were around in force - Beastmen, Squats, Ogryns, Halflings (now Ratlings)The Eldar (Aeldari now) were around in a fairly similar form to now, but there were no Dark Eldar (Drukhari). There were mentions of “Eldar Pirates”, though, which presumably evolved later into the Dark Eldar. Warp gates within each craftworld were mentioned, which would in later editions form the basis of the Webway.The Jokaero were in the 1st edition too, and haven’t really changed since.Genestealers were mentioned as being from Ymgarl. They were not retconned into being Tyranid vanguard organisms until later on, although the Tyranids were also part of lore at the time - along with one of their slave races, the Zoats.The Slann were featured as the most ancient race, and seemed quite active.Orks were, well, Orks. Although they hadn’t yet gotten tribes. Their smaller cousins, the Gretchin, were also there.“Warp Space” allowed for faster travel between worlds, and (for Humanity, at leaest) still required a Navigator and the Astronomican. It was home to strange, dangerous, psychically-attuned creatures such as the Astral Hound, Astral Spectre, and Psychneuein - no mention yet of chaos, although demon-like creatures called “Warp Entities” are there and manifest themselves in our reality through psychic possession, destroying the host in the process.The Inquisition were special agents of the Imperium, who rooted out traitors, cults, and rogue psykers - so pretty much unchanged, really.Looking for Chaos, Tau, Necrontyr? You’re out of luck, they didn’t exist yet!At the end of the book was an example scenario featuring the remnants of the Crimson Fists just after the destruction of their Space-Monastery, as they encounter an Ork patrol on their trek across Rynn’s World (there were even counters to play the battle with so you wouldn’t have to go buy a bunch of minis right away!) - something that has gone pretty much unchanged ever since, to the point that it’s now a major part of 40K history (and the invasion of Rynn’s World forms a big part of GW’s latest game, the new edition of Aeronautica Imperialis!)",37 followers,Bodoh Punya,587,114,275.4K,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-basic-lore-for-Warhammer-40k

While he may not be considered a super-genius, his ability must be significant enough he is able to rebuild and maintain his Kryptonian stronghold on Earth.That said, it is obvious that his natural abilities far exceed a Human's for a variety of reasons he displays every time he uses his powers.In SummaryApocrypha: All-Star SupermanPeople often look at the graphic novel/movie version of ""All-Star Superman"" as a sample of Superman utilizing his superhuman intellect. While he does use his abilities to their fullest there, this particular Superman is an Elseworlds version of the character, not a mainstream continuity version. The DC Animated feature film All-Star Superman was based on the comic book series All-Star Superman.As noted in Wikipedia:Parts of this essay originated on the Science Fiction and Fantasy Stack Exchange.

Given that this is supposed to be science fiction, this causes problems.The first episode hints at the show’s basic outline; earth was destroyed/badly damaged by a mystery object that did unspecified things to the air. A big interstellar ship was built to evacuate a chosen few and the big ship was conveniently equipped with dozens of escape pods that are also self-contained saucer ships. Unexplained alien robots show up and start killing the crew for no reason, so the ship goes to warp/explodes and the Robinson’s escape pod/ship are flung to parts unknown.A bit sketchy, but not irredeemably so.Their escape pod/ship collides with the alien’s ship as it enters the atmosphere of an uncharted planet and ends up skidding across beautiful snow-capped mountains. Because the ship is made of unobtanium it and the crew survive an uncontrolled re-entry and supersonic collision with a literal mountain because main characters don’t die, that’s why.(Mach 7 to this? Didn’t even scratch the paint.)This is familiar territory for Star Wars/Trek fans, but things go rapidly downhill from here.Rather than assess the spaceship that’s keeping them alive, the crew decides now would be a great time to go for a walk. In the course of doing so we find out this space ship doesn’t have airlocks, it just has big single doors that jam half open. This point is doubly made when the ship suddenly breaks through the top of the icy mountain into a mountain lake and promptly sinks like a stone. Because drama, that’s why! The Titanic apparently had more water/air tight doors than this space ship.Now stuck on a mountain top in the falling afternoon light, the crew decides to take off their space suits, why not, and go retrieve a power cell so they don’t freeze to death during the night. After some contrived drama regarding Will Robinson’s performance under pressure, one of his sisters suits up and swims down into the lake to get the battery. This is swiftly accomplished without any depth related concerns (because reasons!) but on her way back to the surface with the battery, the entire mountain lake suddenly and inexplicable freezes solid from top to bottom in about ten seconds, trapping her in ice, because drama.To freeze one gram of zero-degree water you must remove 333.55 joules of energy from it.To freeze a gallon of water, 1,262,620.17 joules of energy must be given off.The energy given off by 100 gallons of freezing water is about the same as a burning gallon of gasoline.Freezing an Olympic swimming pool gives off the same energy as burning 6600 gallons of gas or 833,329,312,200 joules.At a conservative estimate, the lake has at least the same surface area as 16 Olympic pools and is a minimum of 10 deep.Freezing 160 Olympic pools forces out 133,332,689,952,000 joules, or 133 terajoules.The nuclear bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki were 63 and 84 terajoules respectively.So one Robinson is trapped in ice and all the others are violently vaporized along with a substantial chunk of the mountain in a massive explosion.Except this doesn’t happen because the writers have apparently never seen water before and don’t understand how it works.Yeah.Moving On!Mom Robinson points out that the nearby mountain is on fire because the entire thing is made of un-burned magnesium and also, the air is rich in oxygen. Despite the ridiculous impossibility of this, the crew rolls with it and goes to gather a bucket full to melt a chunk of the lake and free their crewmate. While scraping at a deposit that couldn’t be more than a few hours old, Will Robinson goes slipping down a ‘main character’ slide that’s exactly the right size and length to quickly move him off the mountains and below the snow line so he can go have other adventures by himself in the forest while whining about how unworthy he is.(Welcome to set two.)While they’re gone, Mom Robinson must undergo emergency surgery at the hands of one of her daughters because drama! But that’s not enough drama on its own, so the surgery is carried out by the untrained daughter while the medically trained daughter remains frozen in magic ice. Double the drama!On the return of John Robinson, the crew use the magnesium shavings to burn a hole into the ice and expose the gloved hand of their trapped daughter whose air is running out. At this point a simple knife cut, some glue and a long plastic tube would ensure she has all the air she needs, but the crew elects to continue dropping burning metal onto her instead.As the temperature falls to -60 °C, their efforts are suddenly thwarted by magic rain that instantly turns to ice, but only after it fills up the hole they’ve dug. Drama! Instead of pulling the tent over the hole and continuing, the crew wail and gnash their teeth at the unbearable feelings this is calling up in all of them.Meanwhile on set two (sorry willing suspension of disbelief, I wanted it to work but we have irreconcilable differences), Will Robinson wanders off through the forest and finds the crashed alien ship they ran into on their way down. A pair of robot feet chase him through the woods and into a tree where he finds the top half of the robotic humanoid alien. As the alien looks scary and doesn’t speak English, he decides his best course of action is to sit around having feelings and looking anguished.Fortunately for everyone, the rest of the main characters (who can’t die—they’re on contract for more episodes) still need help from the robot on set one up in the mountains, so the entire forest on set two catches fire, why not. The magic fire which produces no smoke gets closer and closer until Will decides in a fit of feelings that he is doomed, dooooomed, and that if he can’t escape alive he might as well save the scary robot by cutting the soft branch it’s top half is stuck on. Apparently, no one told the robot that it’s sharp claws could cut wood.At any rate, the scary alien robot reassembles its two parts, decides it loves humans now, and proceeds to rush up the mountain side with Will to rescue his wailing family. Using its magic robot heat hands it applies enough heat to melt sister Robinson out of 8 feet of ice in three seconds, thus simultaneously cooking, boiling, irradiating her and setting her on fire.But main characters can’t die, so she’s like, fine.The first episode ends with everyone gathering round the robot as it heats them all with its magic hands.",UNKNOWN,Michelle - MAD PIRATE QUEEN,4.4K,4.2K,68.9M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-basic-lore-for-Warhammer-40k

Its a silly scene but its a fun one, and serves to demonstrate the lack of gravity can actually be an interesting plot point. It doesnt get it all right. They wear magnetic boots, but you don’t see their hair waving around wildly due to having no downward pull. Its a minor point, and its understandable that they handwave it away, for the purposes of keeping in budget and not having the actors look like high-tech hobos.The show has other interesting realistic features too. The ships tend to respect orbital mechanics (and use these to good effect in space battles). Often when a battle breaks out, the crew have to throw on their helmets so the ship can decompress. This is so that if a bullet pierces the ship the crew aren’t subjected to sudden decompression forces.So yeah, the Expanse proved that doing physics (mostly) realistically doesn’t make for bad television. So the question is, why don’t the other shows?And yeah, unrealistic gravity is probably the least of Star Treks problems.

For something to be “realistic”, it must be “grim” and also “dark” (hey! Grimdark! That's where it comes from!) and the black and gray morality must be so close to black and black that it's functionally pointless to differentiate between them anymore.This isn't a problem unique to superheroes; a few Twilight Zone episodes pushed the concept (for example, “A Good Life”. It's one of my favorite episodes, yes, but after living and seeing the concept repeated and repeated, it gets old.) as did it's modern-day analog Black Mirror in “U.S.S Callister”. “I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream” ran with the concept of absolute power in a crapsack world, not to mention Game of Thrones.But the real reason I'm bringing this up is because of the apparent ethos for why this trope is so commonly played out, best articulated in the below interview:The Boys' Showrunner Wants It to Be 'the Most Brutally Realistic Depiction of Superheroes'Those powerful forces are superheroes who represent the worst of humanity’s collective id. “So, overall, what we’re really trying to do is [ask] what is the most brutally realistic depiction of superheroes in the real world?” Kripke said. “And with superheroes as insecure and fucked up and self-serving and selfish as real humans really would be if given superpowers, they’d all be super Bill Cosby.

Everything minus does isn’tGee, that escalated quick.But still, the comic isn’t “grim”. It isn’t “dark”. It’s about a kid with reality-warping powers. Sometimes she uses them selfishly, as a child is wont to do, but like mostAnd have a little fun in the process.Again, she’s a child.This is, in my opinion, the most realistic of the whole “Oh, person gets phenomenal godlike power! What will they do with it?!” trope I’ve seen thus far. This is exactly how I would expect a real life child to behave if given this power.And frankly, I’d be fine with that. I wouldn’t live in fear or eternal dread. I’d just be like… okay. It might be weird the first time I see her turn a bully into a tree and not change them back, or take a friend’s request to be sent 80 years into the past literally. But it’s never malicious. It’s seldom vindictive. It’s usually harmless. And it’s always cute. Kids aren’t naturally malicious. People won’t give up all morals and ethics when given power.And sometimes a reality-warping girl will turn all human life into ghosts. What’re you going to do, really?And that was where I wanted to end the answer, but I feel like enough justice hasn’t been done to explain why this comic brings such powerful emotions up in my chest.That’s probably because the original author hasn’t been heard from since 2016, and the website that once hosted the comics is stillborn. The comic itself ended long before that, but still… it just hurts. It hurts to see the one kindhearted depiction of a child with these powers fade into obscurity.If I’m the only one out there to spread the good word of minus, then so be it.

An alien ecosystem is likely to wreak havoc on the average human, particularly if the atmosphere is close enough to human compatible that it supports life dependent on the same chemicals as ours. Just breathing the air is likely to trigger fatal anaphylaxis as our immune system freaks out from inhaling airborne biologicals.Then there’s quarantine. I can’t drive from one end of Australia to the other without disposing of any fruit and vegetables I might be carrying. I can’t take wood products into the country without serious certification. In fact, you can’t even enter Australia without certifying that you are not carrying any bees or beekeeping equipment with you.Why? More to the point, who carries bees on a plane?Biosecurity is the answer (not the carrying bees question, I don’t know the answer to that). Apart from all the appalling pests we deliberately introduced, Australia is remarkably isolated from other ecosystems. A new parasite or insect could destroy major parts of our ecosystem, much as the introduction of rabbits in a place where they had no natural predators and so bred out of control, or the poisonous cane toads that were introduced to control sugar cane beetles (they didn’t, they eat other native frogs, and anything that tries to eat them dies). With the bees, Australia is the only continent (apart from Antarctica - that doesn’t count) not to host the devastating varroa mite which is currently destroying bee populations throughout the world.The human body contains literally tens of trillions of microorganisms - bacteria, viruses, fungi, archaea, and so on. Any transference of biological material could be a disaster. The microorganisms on a single exhaled breath could be enough to create a cascading ecological catastrophe in an alien ecosystem. A drop of saliva, a spill of blood, sweat, anything that comes from the human body could be the start of an ecocide.God help you if you take a crap on an alien planet. That biological transference is a two-way street, remember.I don’t have a problem with this in most space operas.But something aspiring to even a bit of realism?

That room alone has so much wasted space it is astounding the engineers got away with such a design, it is also evidence that the movie did not consult a decent engineer and was more focused on aesthetics…Spacecraft are designed to have minimal living space in order to maximise storage and minimise structural mass. This is amazingly important. Here is a picture from inside the ISS:There is enough space for an astronaut to stretch out and move slightly… and that is it. This room has exactly the same function as the one I picked from ‘The Martian’, it is the exercise room. Notice how there are packets on the walls storing stuff, and things are compact and made to fold up to be put away?Naturally there are exceptions to this rule in movies…A spacecraft designed as a hotel would obviously be all about space and aesthetics.A work trip to Mars, though… no.Addition:Several people point out the lengths of time are different and the mental state should be considered…The amount of space for the ISS crew member would have worked just as well in centriptal acceleration (artificial gravity) as it would have in free fall (zero gravity)As for mental state, crew are exerted to psychological and wellbeing studies even before they get on the ship… it is likened to being on a submarine (or some ships) a situation studied extensively in the navy over extremelly long periods… and they have the same living issues with gravity included but no nice views.

Like,The opposite problem happens in some, like Star Wars. The turning point for me to leave Star Wars behind from the latest set of movies was actually the over-diversity of the alien species overwhelming Maz Kanata's castle.They’re obviously trying to recreate another cantina scene, but after the first Star Wars movie set (episode 4–6), the expanded universe largely tried to keep to these aliens that we initially saw, diving into their culture, their home worlds, unique abilities, etc. And it took decades to cover that ground.All of the sudden, we get an explosion of more aliens showing up, and then some more in the next, in the same instance George Lucas got a hold of computer-generated tech and vomited ungodly amounts of new aliens all over the place wherever he could. The problem this presents is… all of these alien species are unique creatures, but they’re set up as some kind of ultra-singular 1:1:1:1:1:1:1:1:1:2:2:3:4 ratio of uniqueness or close (except humans). On top of that, they all exist on the exact same atmosphere without problem. Even if each of these aliens shared a home planet with one other intelligent life form, we would get hundreds of home worlds.And yet, all of them work with and developed the same technology. They all breathe each other’s atmospheres… unless they’re droids, they breathe period. None of them are overly superior or inferior in technology over the other. We clearly see them convening on the same location, so all of them had to get there by space travel at some point.And like I said, not just the variety of aliens, but variety in technology is almost always lacking. I applaud those sci-fi franchises that can implement a strong sense of interesting diversity in it’s elements when different species come together. There’s a multitude of theories and possibilities on things like weapon usage, which shapes battle doctrines, and FTL travel methods.We should see something unusual and exotic like Japanese Samurai fighting a Spartan Hoplite, or as weird as rabid archer squirrels teaming up with hornets the size of lemons to fight against an invasion of anthropomorphic lawn mowers and vacuum cleaners.","105,674 followers",Dave Consiglio,631,6.8K,91.6M,2018,https://www.quora.com/How-smart-is-Superman-Does-he-have-the-potential-to-be-super-intelligent

My favorite film of his when I was younger wasThe trend now in movies is to just create female characters and hope they happen to be strong characters for purely political reasons. Think about the dumpster fires that are the new Disney-madeI deal primarily in self defense firearms training, I was a black belt, a decent high school wrestler, and now I do primarily weightlifting and BJJ. I am neither tough nor have I ever hit an intimate partner (especially a woman). All that said, what I'm about to say is very important: women now no longer understand how much stronger men are as a gender. Hell, half of America doesn't even recognize what gender is. If you are a woman who believes that gender is just some made up, oppressive tool of the evil patriarchy, why wouldn't you take it a step further and attack men like all the cool women you idolize on TV?Recently, I've been watchingI can appreciate the willing suspension of disbelief needed to enjoy a good fantasy/sci-fi story. If it happens on a parallel planet or world, away from Earth's laws, where dragons fly, I suppose it is completely harmless to pretend that your average female knight can just beat up the Tolkien Middle Earth equivalent of a SEAL Team 6 veteran with Tim Kennedy's combat skills. After all, we all just watchedIn actuality this is very dangerous.I'm meeting women who are legitimately coming to my store saying things like this: “I don't want a gun because guns are dangerous. What I need is a knife. If a man is trying to hurt me, I can claw and fight him off and then get to a knife and kill him.” Well, ladies, if stopping rape with an edged weapon was that easy I'm sure it would be common practice by now. Edged weapons have been around about as long as rape has been. If you could just pull out a knife and stop a rapist, then 12% of the world's population wouldn't have Genghis Khan's DNA.If that's not bad enough, I'm seeing a marked increase in women who want training after they acted up in a bar fight and someone disabused them of the notion that “women are just as strong as men"" in a very savage way. I've seen recent surveillance footage of women now instigating fights against men twice their size, with no real thought to the consequences. When they end up sailing back across the room thanks to a punch or a good, hard slap, they can't figure out what happened and immediately start crying (IF they are still conscious).Ladies, please, for your own safety let me use the little kid from“The day I can push something the size of a basketball out of my netherworld, I'll concede your point. Until that day, just assume that nature has bestowed upon males certain inherent physiological advantages that make them much, much more likely to beat the ever-loving shit out of you in combat than the other way around. You are not Ronda Rousey. Ronda Rousey's own mother was on record multiple times as saying that she wouldn't stand a chance in a fight against a male fighter. Yes, I'm aware that some women on planet earth are stronger or better with submissions than some men. This is not news to me.You are not that woman.The number of women who could actually beat up a moderately strong, 20-45 year old man who knows how to wrestle and fight is down to the single digits, if at all.Just because a female superhero you love can beat up a bad guy by punching him in the nuts (because of course, that always works in Hollywood in 2019) doesn't mean that you should just attack a man when you get angry with him. A man who is tuned up, who keeps himself in decent shape, who is in the prime of life, and who is angry, is not going to just fall over when you punch him in the balls. I'm sorry. Our testicles shrink or expand based off a variety of factors for a variety of reasons. The male species doesn't just have his penis and testes exposed for someone to smash in a fight. While it is vulnerable, it is nowhere near as vulnerable an area as Hollywood would have you believe. Watch a boxer take aThe easiest way to prove my broader point is to ask women who believe this malarkey a very simple question: Are women tough enough that they can do anything a man can do? If so, then why do we need to make sure and protect women from men who beat them? Either we all are equal, or else we aren't. If women are just as strong as men then you don't need special protection under the law from abusive male lovers or things like battered women's shelters. If women can protect themselves then why should men never be allowed to hit them in a fight?If you want me to teach men not to hit women, that's okay. I'm all for that. That's what good men have taught our sons for two millennia without feminists harping at us or sermonizing to us. However, I tell women that the one good part of getting hit in the face is that it is a very good reminder to you not to do or say dumb shit again in the future. Everyone is a good punch away from being polite.If all we teach women in movies is: “Girl power!”, and “It's sexist to assume I'm weak because I have ovaries!”, and “we can do anything men can do!”, we, as a species, can't really be shocked when our wives, daughters and girlfriends start showing up at hospitals after bar fights with broken noses and fractured skulls.",501 followers,Martin Guerra Vidal,552,304,3.3M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Which-unrealistic-science-fiction-tropes-annoy-you-the-most-Why

And other nobles like the Duke of Mars and the Lord of Uranus.Yet in the modern world nations have been moving away from being ruled by Kings and Queen’s for a very long time. While some countries may have kings or leaders who refer to themselves as king or queen. That’s just a nicer way of saying dictator. Most Kings, Queens and Emperor’s today are figureheads.Most of the people of the world prefer Democracy. People would rather choose their leaders even in countries that aren’t democratic. Why in a future society if humans can travel across the universe. terraform planets, have advancements in technology. Why would humans choose feudalism has a form of government? With an emperor ruling over us.Why would we regress? I’m not knocking Frank Herbert’s work. Herbert actually explained why the civilization in Dune exists.But this seems to be a continuing theme with some science fiction stories. Some writers I know always use the space empire trope. Or space dictator.Yet in the biggest science fiction franchise’s Star Wars and Star Trek. Star Wars had a Republic governed by a senate and chancellor. And a group of rebels opposing a megalomaniac tyrant who proclaimed himself Emperor.In Star Trek the United Federation of Planets was governed by the Federation council and lead by a President.The Klingon Empire was ruled by a council and chancellor. They hadn’t had an emperor in three centuries until the clone of Kahless became the new emperor. But his position was ceremonial.The Romulan’s were governed by a senate and lead by a praetor or pro consul. They never clarified if the Romulan’s had a Royal family. I have heard passing references to an Empress. If they have an Empress, she must just be a figurehead.The Dominion and Cardassian’s didn’t have an emperor or nobles. The Borg have a Queen. But she’s not exactly regal.I’m not sure future people will choose an emperor to rule over them. If they have space travel and other cool things like replicators and transporters. If they can cure diseases and allow humans to live longer and healthier. Why would they embrace an absolute monarchy? Wouldn’t they mostly be interested in maintaining their authority and position?The other trope that gets a little tiresome is the Nazis. The Nazis and Nazism isn’t really that interesting of a subject. They were a kleptocracy of scheming back stabbers. Their leader was a prima donna with one testicle who thought he was a military genius and was wrong.George Lucas based the empire on the Nazis. A ruthless authoritarian regime with snappy uniforms.But that’s where the comparison ends. And in the original trilogy we didn’t see the day-to-day workings of the empire. That would have been boring. Instead, we got cool battles and good vs evil. Not political and social commentary. The audience was left to figure things out on their own. And use their imagination. But the writers of the new films wanted to make the point the Empire and First Order are the Nazis Damnit!The makers of Rouge One declared in a tweet the empire is White Supremacy. Disney made them take it down.In the Force Awakens the First Order or Empire 2.0. General Hux gives a rousing speech that’s a bit to reminiscent of any fascist leader in history.I think they laid it on a bit thick with the allegory. Lucas never had scenes like that. Sure, the imperials lined up for Vader and Palpatine. But neither ever delivered a Hitler style speech.More allegory here and I think they were trying to make a point. They did drive the message home a little hard.Yet a lot of writers seem obsessed with Nazis and fascism. And these days they want to use it as an allegory for Trump and Maga country.The Purge movies are garbage, and this is just lazy writing. Idiots running around in costumes finding creative ways to murder people. That was the premise of every 1980’s slasher film. And then when Trump won the presidency and the alt right appeared. Suddenly Hollywood took notice. And seems convinced people would actually participate in this lunacy. Also, if all crime is legal doesn’t that include rape and child molestation? Are people going to allow such a thing to happen to their families? I don’t think they thought this through. Better writers could have done more with the premise. But I can see a room full of Hollywood assholes discussing how violent and awful Americans are. Without holding a mirror up to themselves.Over the past few years Donald Trump and his supporters have been in the spotlight. And the so-called alt right. And the belief America will become a fascist state any day now. Apparently with Trump has dictator and roaming bands of his supporters keeping us all in check. I think that’s personally bullshit. Did anyone actually watch January 6th? Do you think these idiots could take over our government? I don't think they could take over a Denny’s.A lot of Science Fiction and related stories keep using the Nazi and Trump allegory.I am not a Trump supporter and I never voted for him nor would I. The metaphors and allegory get tiresome after a while. I think they are giving him far too much credit.","3,351 followers",Eduardo Marqués Collado,4.2K,943,11.3M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Which-unrealistic-science-fiction-tropes-annoy-you-the-most-Why

Modern 5th-gen fighters would likely be able to kill 3–6 fighters per mission without being shot down.(Mind you the Empire could totally defeat Earth, just by bombarding from space, but that’s what it would take.)Another Example.A quick note.#1: Armor. That armor is supposedly VERY good against shrapnel. And in canon is more or less slug thrower-proof. (A slug thrower is more or less = to a modern hand gun round or shotgun pellet)#2: Blasters are again, VERY SLOW. Hand-held blasters in Star Wars fire a bolt that goes about as fast as a major league baseball pitchers throw.So stormtroopers would actually be more effective than TIE fighters. But they would still be more or less at a disadvantage against modern combat troops, whose weapons fire much faster, are impossible to ‘dodge’ and modern combat troops have better backup.This is all a massive issue, because what you end up with is an “advanced military” that would honestly have a lot of trouble with a WW2 field army. Hell, if they where using TIE fighters, WW2 era prop planes would be effective.A war with the Empire vs Earth would come down to:A: The Empire lands troops, vehicles, and fighters.B: They get totally wrecked by even a mid-range military on Earth.C: They try again only now Earth has figured out how the good bits of their tech work and are better now.D: They give up and just bombard a few cities flat. Get hit with nukes in space.E: Back up… and bombard more cities.F: Earth gives up and the Empire sets about the process of figuring out how all this “super advanced” technology Earth is using works.Star Wars… can to some extent be excused. Because it is very clearly a very heavily stylized sci-fi setting. And some sci-fi does a much better job at actually seaming ‘hi-tech”like….Star Trek.Star Trek gets something right in that it makes most strange tech problems seem more like choices then out-and-out flaws.They don’t use guns in Star Trek because modern body armor in Star Trek makes you immune to gun fire. The reason no one uses body armor is because no one is dumb enough to use a gun.",0 followers,Tamara M,2.1K,101,14.1M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Which-unrealistic-science-fiction-tropes-annoy-you-the-most-Why

Let’s go blow up some planets!”That’s fun, and I genuinely like Star Wars, but it does make character who are teetering on the edge, like Kylo Ren, seem a little out of place. How come Fin sees through years of brainwashing to just shoot people he’s told to and yet Kylo, who appears to be a little torn and also has access to the people in charge, is taking so long to cotton on to the fact that the First Order leadership has no plan beyond: ‘kill as many people as possible while looking evil’?I like baddies with motivation (even if that motivation is just that they are completely bonkers and just want to watch the world burn) and/or moral grey areas.The cylons who were enslaved by humans, then rose up and now relentlessly pursue them so they never come back and take back their colonies. The Vogons who destroy earth entirely, because it was on their to-do list and the apathetic bloody humans never bothered to check in with the galactic planning council to object to its demolition. The Borg, compelled to achieve perfection by forcibly assimilating any new species they encounter to add their biological and technological disctinctiveness to their collective hive-mind.

In the Clone Wars, some worlds were fought over almost as long as the war itself, much like the Siege of Leningrad in World War Two. In addition, single battle takeovers are more plausible if thr objective is merely a strategic location planetside (i.e. a capital city, a spaceport) and not the entire planet. In this sense, Episode I is actually a good example, as the combat primarily takes place around Naboo’s capital city.This leads me to…No Sense of Scale:One of the potentially great things about military sci-fi is the scale of it. A war forHowever, no one seems to realize that interstellar war should be huge. Take the Clone Army, for example. It’s exact size is hard to determine but it has about 3,000,000 “units” at the start of the war.If “unit” refers to an individual soldier (i.e. like an individual product, as these are literally clones ordered and sold like goods) then this is laughably small. 3,000,000 soldiers is about on par with the largest militaries on Earth right now, but still, it’s not nearly enough to conquer even a single planet.If we’re being generous and assume “unit” refers to, say, a whole division of 10,000, then we arrive at around 30,000,000,000 troops. More than enough to take Earth, but fight for a whole galaxy? I’ll have to think about that.
