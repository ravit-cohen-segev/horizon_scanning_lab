They can carry and accumulate debt until they cease to exist as there is potentially no limit to their earnings and ability to pay interest.Imagine how much would change if humans became immortal beings whose working life was possible infinite. Imagine going to the bank and asking for a loan worth two hundred times your annual income with an even longer time to pay back the principal. Imagine how credit institutions would struggle to even comprehend the implications of this.I wonder if I would simply be able to get a 100 million dollar loan and invest it immediately in a bunch of indexed funds that yield more than the interest rate on whatever loan I took out. That would be great wouldn’t it?Of course such a situation would be impossible or at least become impossible when people figure out the implications of this whole immortality thing.",3 followers,Mark Bradford,12.8K,579,2.5M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Without-waxing-too-philosophical-what-are-some-possibly-hidden-ways-the-sudden-surge-of-technology-will-change-the-way-society-develops

2,"“Hive mind” is exactly the kind of right wing propaganda that armors Americans in cultural resistance to cooperative behavior. Whether the OP is conservative or not is unimportant; plenty of liberals have bought into the negative depiction of cooperation by choice rather than by coercion, coercion being the ideal conservative motivator, the meaner the better. Incentives are the preferred liberal motivator.Seldom does anybody appeal to empathy.It is essential to the continuing dominance by the investor class through brass knuckle capitalism that Americans look askance at empathy.

Whether the OP is conservative or not is unimportant; plenty of liberals have bought into the negative depiction of cooperation by choice rather than by coercion, coercion being the ideal conservative motivator, the meaner the better. Incentives are the preferred liberal motivator.Seldom does anybody appeal to empathy.It is essential to the continuing dominance by the investor class through brass knuckle capitalism that Americans look askance at empathy. For empathy is the essence of a cooperative society. Few American liberals value or even believe in the existence of empathy. Rather, they argue for enlightened self interest, claiming that selfishness can be turned to do good given sufficient profit incentives. What I’m saying is that American Liberals usually lose the argument for cooperative behavior because they frame their propositions in defeatist terms, conceding the false proposition that empathy has no force.The hive mind is a propaganda boogeyman. The term is used pejoratively to mean socialistic or communistic societies where everyone resonates in agreement. The Hive is always portrayed as something to fear, something that will destroy a true American’s precious individualism, which is in practice just another word for the right to be an asshole in defiance of social well being.This indoctrination through entertainment, through the proxy stories about ourselves, has mostly worked. We are a greatly desensitized people. Even empathetic outliers have learned that their passion for the well being of all can be an embarrassment to them when the trolls (I’d say conservative trolls but that would be redundant) viciously attack them with smears and ridicule.So here we have a very typical American proposition: The Hive Mind does not exist and yet we are afraid of it. Empathy does indeed exist and yet we are embarrassed by it. The result is continual conflict that makes people doubt their own ability to govern, doubt that civility is possible, doubt themselves as a people so much that they willingly hand over power to businesses and political entities that will grind them to dust in pursuit of profit and power.A note of irony is in order. We do, in fact, have something rather like the hive mind that is not so much all minds joined into one, as it is, many minds severely repressed and thus greatly susceptible to both advertising and demagoguery. I see this in politics, and I see this in the marketplace. This condition is not a sharing of consciousness, it is the complete repression of consciousness characteristic of lynch mobs and Nuremberg rallies. The closest thing to the hive mind today is consumerist fascism, where people don’t think alike, they just don’t think at all..",1 follower,Kirk Scott,2K,13.4K,68.3M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Without-waxing-too-philosophical-what-are-some-possibly-hidden-ways-the-sudden-surge-of-technology-will-change-the-way-society-develops

5,"Yes, for those without higher education.For example, in the 1940s - 1960s, when manufacturing jobs abounded (across the US, at least), many people could make entire careers with jobs that required nothing more than a high school education, and sometimes not even that. Equipment operators just had to get familiar with the tools, something that didn’t require anything more than on-the-job training.In the late 1960s and early 1970s, more and more jobs were being taken over by automation.

Many jobs that are still handled by humans are only done so out of habit and “that personal touch”. For example, many fast-food restaurants could be completely automated, requiring just one or two people who just took charge in emergencies. They’re still staffed by people, though, because fast-food employers are used to having people make the food and assume their customers want real people making it.McDonald’s has experimented with automated ordering in some locationsBut we see technology displacing even non-manufacturing jobs. How many bank teller positions have been eliminated with the advent of the ATM? Some bank tellers have college degrees, but it’s certainly not required. I worked as a teller before I had my degree. All that was needed was on-the-job training.Real people are still required for jobs such as in healthcare, law and technical engineering. Despite the current hype over AI, computers still can’t program themselves and can’t really “think” despite any outward appearances. Technology has certainly helped in all these areas, but nothing has displaced the need for actual humans and their creative minds in these areas.And higher education is required for most of these positions. Even if a college degree isn’t strictly required for these jobs (such as software engineering), employers typically prefer that piece of paper for any perspective employee. So, an employer hires a software engineer with a degree, and he goes on to invent new technologies that further displaces people with automation…Image credits:","135,557 followers",Hector Quintanilla,3.1K,1.2K,88.6M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Without-waxing-too-philosophical-what-are-some-possibly-hidden-ways-the-sudden-surge-of-technology-will-change-the-way-society-develops
