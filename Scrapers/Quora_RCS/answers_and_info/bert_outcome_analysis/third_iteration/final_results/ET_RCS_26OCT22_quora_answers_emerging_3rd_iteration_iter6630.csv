6,Is Apple scrambling to keep up with the evolving and innovative technology on other smartphones?“Scrambling” implies chaotic and uncontrolled activity. It’s not that - it’s considered and planned with a sense of urgency. Because that’s how engineers do innovation best. Apple does a good job at that.,0 followers,Tim Ventura,801,1.1K,11.5M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-can-be-some-good-pictures-which-I-can-sketch-or-paint-for-the-topic-Evolving-Technology

They didn’t make the first personal computer, the first digital music player, the first tablet, the first digital camera, or the first mobile phone.

10,"When I was in college in the late 1970s, nobody knew what a computer scientist or a software engineer was. “Something about computers, right?” Now there are movies about hackers. “Have you ever cracked triple-DES in under 60 seconds?”In the years since I graduated from college, new fundamental algorithms and data structures have been invented. Fundamental problems that I thought were optimally solved have new, faster solutions.

Fundamental problems that I thought were optimally solved have new, faster solutions. I’m talking about searching and sorting, not something esoteric.When I was a new hire, every software project started with a blank slate. Today, every project is a feature added onto a 10-year-old code base. The optimal approach to a problem is different when you’re starting from scratch than when you have to fit into existing code. My finely honed skills are less employable than they once were.My graduating class was 35% women. My first development team was 1/3 women. Now they are gone. Damn brogrammers chased ’em away. I kinda miss women.At my first job in the 1980s, software engineers were a valued (even honored) part of a larger engineering team consisting of electrical and mechanical engineers. If I was working today, I’d be a frikkin’ galley slave, rowing my ass off for the privilege of staying employed.Every good developer once had a library of books. Remember books—those bundles of paper glued together on one side? Today most beginning and intermediate problems can be solved by asking a question that starts off, “Hey, google…” Every problem has been solved before, but today we can see the solution. You can tell you’re asking a really advanced question when google doesn’t give you any relevant search results. But books were like that too.I used to stare down the muzzle of a particle accelerator that smashed electrons into a sheet of phosphors located a few inches in front of my eyes. Jeez I love flat-screens. My first portable computer weighed 18 pounds. My current one weighs 18 ounces.","78,457 followers",Shovan Chowdhury,5.1K,505,37.6M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-can-be-some-good-pictures-which-I-can-sketch-or-paint-for-the-topic-Evolving-Technology
