Let me try to break it down a little, please correct me if I am wrong.Yes, mankind has some awesome technology, and yes we are interested in going to space (but we spend WAY, WAY more money on entertainment than we do on funding space research and exploration.So then, if those things are true, and you think of the surface of the earth as neutral territory, why wouldn't going in the other direction garner as much curiosity and exploration?I think the premise of that logic is faulty for a number of reasons, not the least of which is the extreme difference in physical characteristics between outer space and the core of our planet.Firstly, who’s to say we aren't fascinated? Remember that terrible movie The Core? I don't blame you if you don't, but it is essentially a sci-fi movie about humans and the core of the earth. There’s no good science in it, but if you love totally unreal space fiction, then you'll probably like it. Also, Journey to the Center of the Earth is a famously important 1864 novel by Jules Verne and you can find variations on the theme stretching from then to now.Second, we know A LOT more about the Earth and its core than we do about space, relatively speaking. We know how big it is, we know what it's made of and we know to a pretty good extent how it functions in some very basic physical ways. Those things we know are observable, provable and the information is readily available to interested parties. Check this out from National Geographic, it breaks it down pretty nicely and is also the first google result on “how do we know about the earth’s core”Earth’sSpace, on the other hand, as a whole, we know much less about, if only because it is essentially INFINITELY larger than the Earth’s core. In Cosmology (which is, among other things, the study of the entire Universe as a single unit) we can guess mathematically at what shape/form it may be on the grandest macro-scale, but we have very little ability to test or observe these predictions relative to the things we think we know about the core of the earth. We only recently were able to image the CMB (cosmic microwave background radiationThat doesn't tell us a whole lot, and please don't misunderstand that to be a picture of the shape of the universe, the way we take the measurements and stitch them together causes it to look like that.In a flat 3 dimensions, such as how we perceive reality now, the universe is infinite in all directions, which means no matter how far you go in any direction you wouldSpace is exciting, and I believe it will always represent a frontier of the unknown and mysterious, no matter how much we explore and learn about it. The core of the earth just doesn't rise to that level, in my opinion, and I think in the opinion of most people. Still, it is a fascinating topic in its own right, but one I think we’ve explored to a sufficient degree for now.",18 followers,Asim Qureshi,12.7K,996,155.9M,2016,https://www.quora.com/Is-it-because-of-more-advanced-technology-in-medicine-that-a-vaccine-will-be-ready-so-soon-by-the-end-of-this-year-as-opposed-to-years-in-developing

12,"Yeah, I’ve given up on the fight between “fracking” and “fracing.” Spell it how you will. Arguing over it is just petty.So, what do I think of it? It is a tool, a process for increasing the flow of hydrocarbons from a well. Doing it successfully depends on expertise and care. The wells I supervised were fracked by Halliburton and Dowell, and in over 200 completed wells, there was just one failure. It was due to a bad cement job, and the result was disaster for a small town in western Pennsylvania. I’ve been away from the oilfield for a while now, so I’m not sure how it turned out in the end.

It was due to a bad cement job, and the result was disaster for a small town in western Pennsylvania. I’ve been away from the oilfield for a while now, so I’m not sure how it turned out in the end. The last plan I heard was to extend the town’s water well by about 100’ to get away from the contamination.Most fracking failures are the result of a bad cement job. The thixotropic hydraulic cement is meant to solidify and seal the annulus, that space between the casing and the wall of the borehole. When the seal is incompetent, pressure will force fluid past it and up the annulus, thus contaminating the water-bearing stratum near the surface. That is a disaster.I never questioned the need for fracking. It was the process that made the exploration and development possible. Without it, we would still be totally at the mercy of OPEC. With it, we use more natural gas and less coal, although at this point the difference is academic.We’ve already put too much CO2 into the atmosphere and heated up the planet beyond recovery. We’ll have a difficult life as we go into the next few decades. It’s the grandchildren I feel most sorry for. They will bear the full brunt of catastrophic climate change. It is in their lifetimes that the glaciers and icecaps will melt, sea levels will rise, and billions will be displaced.Some folks will say “We still have time to change, to turn things around! If only people changed their habits!” Does anyone remember the paper drives and rubber drives of the WWII era? The call to save valuable resources for the war effort? Sharing responsibility for moving our country forward? It was all propaganda. The amounts collected were a pittance compared to what was needed. The effort called for was to give people something to focus on, to redirect their outlooks. That’s what’s happening now. People are calling for everyone around the globe to just care a bit more, recycle a bit more, eat a bit less meat, drive less, walk or bike more. It doesn’t shift the needle an inch. It’s worse than useless, because it moves us away from criticizing the 100 or so big multinational companies out there responsible for 70% of global CO2 output. There is no big push to shut them down immediately and shift to cleaner processes to get by. The crisis will build, and when it crashes upon us, it will be to late to do anything.If we stopped now, climate momentum would continue global warming for decades, too long for us to recover from the effects. We all know that it’s not going to stop today. We need the industries to make our current quality of life possible. No one is willing to give up cars and air conditioning and burning coal for fuel. It’s not going to happen.What do I think of fracking? It doesn’t matter a bit.","5,990 followers",Jens Böttiger,566,2.6K,17.6M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Is-it-because-of-more-advanced-technology-in-medicine-that-a-vaccine-will-be-ready-so-soon-by-the-end-of-this-year-as-opposed-to-years-in-developing

I am not going to elaborate this further because its for us to see. But should we be happy about it? That leads us to my second questionWhile it is true that India has advanced immensely in the last 20 years, the real question is has this made us more dependent on other countries? Most notably the United States and recently China?Despite having a population of 1.3 billion people and being touted as the software superpower (thanks to the IT services industry) not so long ago, India does not have self-reliance when it comes to technology. China created companies like Ali Baba, Baidu and Tencent a parallel to the American tech giants while India (even India’s telecom minister recently) takes pride in being the largest consumer of Whatsapp, and Facebook! Yes almost everyone has a mobile phone in India today and therefore the opportunities for growth is tremendous. But the real question one should ask is, who will be the beneficiaries of these opportunities? The mobile phones used in India are Chinese phones and the software used in these phones are U.S owned. Basically all our data, from our shopping habits to our entertainment preferences are in the hands of foreign technology companies. Now we know IoT is catching up fast and that means more control to these companies and India will be a proud consumer supplying data.One of the many important aspects discussed in Rajiv Malhotra’s latest book “Artificial Intelligence and the Future of Power, Five Battlegrounds” is India’s military dependence on foreign technology. While the manufacturing of Rafale jets will happen in India, the technology is owned by the French and let’s understand when such technology transfers occur between countries, the supplying country will always provide a technology that is one generation behind to the consuming country. That means we are technologically and militarily advanced compared to our previous generations but we are at least one generation behind the innovating countries! In certain areas like military that is not good newsMy last point on this is our pride in our Human resource and how skilled we are! Yes as individuals many Indians are CEOs of big foreign tech giants. But how does that benefit India as a nation? Do we have a stake in the intellectual property of these products? Can we say for instance Sunder Pichai as Google’s CEO holds the same clout in his company as Mark Zuckerberg holds in Facebook? Certainly not! Let’s not confuse individual brilliance with technological advancement as nation.For India to have a grand standing in the world stage as a technologically advanced nation, we need to come out of our consumer mindset and to quote Rajiv Malhotra’s words “be producers of knowledge and technology”.","68,768 followers",Kanthaswamy Balasubramaniam,898,17.3K,413.3M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Is-it-because-of-more-advanced-technology-in-medicine-that-a-vaccine-will-be-ready-so-soon-by-the-end-of-this-year-as-opposed-to-years-in-developing
