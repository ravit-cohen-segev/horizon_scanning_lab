I think US and many countries are concerned and wondering why China government is investing heavily in Huawei support. They have won many 5G deals with prices with clearly negative profit. Could there be a reason related in global politics and intelligence? Combining this to the fact that some Chinese chipsets has proven to include backdoor to access the data from outside, there is clearly a risk that there is something fishy in the motives of China government to push Huawei the world leader in the networks.On the other hand at this moment US don't have much choice than rely on foreign suppliers if they want to build 5G networks.
