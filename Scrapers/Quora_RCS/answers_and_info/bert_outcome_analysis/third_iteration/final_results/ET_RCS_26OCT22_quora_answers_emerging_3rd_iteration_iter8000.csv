0,"Lots of things are possible, but this one actually isn’t.Because to download information from “outer space,” there would need to be a real-world physical transfer of something. Energy or fields or particles. We understand all these sufficiently well that we can say: if there was, we’d know about it. There isn’t.",UNKNOWN,Robert Frost,1K,9.4K,195.6M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Is-it-possible-that-humans-are-a-super-computer-that-downloads-information-outside-the-human-visual-range-from-outer-space-and-uploads-information-to-outer-space-as-well
1,"It’s not impossible, but it is ludicrously far-fetched. Despite all our science, we have never managed to detect any such communication, and we have much simpler and more logical answers to any question that could be explained by your proposal.",UNKNOWN,Robert Frost,3.4K,9.4K,195.6M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Is-it-possible-that-humans-are-a-super-computer-that-downloads-information-outside-the-human-visual-range-from-outer-space-and-uploads-information-to-outer-space-as-well
2,"Yes, up is away from the mass that defines the local gravity well and down is towards the mass that defines the local gravity well.So, in Earth orbit, down is towards the Earth and up is away from the Earth. Once one leaves the Earth’s sphere of influence, up is away from the Sun and down is towards the Sun.",UNKNOWN,Ernest W.

3,"“Space is pretty much a vacuum. Depending on how near or far the closest star is, there can be extreme temperatures.

Depending on how near or far the closest star is, there can be extreme temperatures. Close to a star or gas giant, there can be extreme radiation.Space is very hazardous. We haven’t evolved to survive in vacuum, extreme temperatures, or under the onslaught of extreme radiation. Earth very kindly protects us from all three.When an astronaut goes outside the International Space Station to do a spacewalk, they wear a special suit that was especially designed to protect them from vacuum and temperatures. That suit does nothing to protect the astronaut from radiation. That’s part of the reason we keep the ISS in such a low orbit. Radiation exposure increases with altitude, in low Earth orbit.Far from a star, space has a temperature of 2.7 Kelvin (-454.81 degrees Fahrenheit). This comes from the cosmic microwave background - remnant photons from the big bang. Close to a star, such as in Earth’s orbit, an object is exposed to aboutAnd we haven’t even gotten to the long term biological effects of microgravity.Keeping people alive and healthy in space is hard.",UNKNOWN,Viktor T.

4,"Space travel costs so much for various reasons. For one thing, it's more dangerous and requires a larger safety margin.Consider the relative costs of a bicycle, a car, a private jet, and a spacecraft. Each goes faster and is more dangerous than the last. Each requires more training than the last.The cost of cars has come down a lot from what it was in its early days, thanks to the assembly line and economies of scale, but it's still 100 times the price of a good bicycle.At present, spacecraft have no economies of scale. Nobody is building them in bulk. There isn't the demand. So each one is buSpace travel costs so much for various reasons.

Nobody is building them in bulk. There isn't the demand. So each one is built from scratch by hand, like an early car was. And it requires a ton of supporting equipment to be useful. The fuel isn't that expensive, but the launch pad and telemetry are.Finally, and this is where the rubber meets the road so far as economics are concerned, there's simply nothing in space that we need so badly that large-scale missions there will pay for themselves. Exploration, yes. Colonization, no.To put it bluntly, we don't colonize space because the investment is extremely high and the return, at the moment, is zero. Anything we can get from space, we can find more cheaply on Earth.",64 followers,Shivansh Singh,1.9K,401,926.7K,2017,https://www.quora.com/Is-it-possible-that-humans-are-a-super-computer-that-downloads-information-outside-the-human-visual-range-from-outer-space-and-uploads-information-to-outer-space-as-well
5,"If the human eye was not limited to seeing between certain frequencies, would outer space still appear to be dark and void? Can you imagine what outer space would look like?Forget space, earth would be a visual seizure. You could see all of the waves from the wifi in your house and your neighbors house, and the city wifi. You’d see gps signals and every radio station signals, and the tv station signals, you’d see body heat rising off of people and animals and you’d see weird uv reflections off of long dried stains on the road and sidewalk.We see 0.0035% of the EM spectrum, that means there areIf the human eye was not limited to seeing between certain frequencies, would outer space still appear to be dark and void?
