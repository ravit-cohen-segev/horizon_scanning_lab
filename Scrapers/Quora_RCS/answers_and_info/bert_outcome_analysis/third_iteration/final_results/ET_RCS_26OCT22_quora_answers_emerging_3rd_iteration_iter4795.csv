We live in a rural part of the country where there are a lot of Amish families, and we have had two different families live next to us, although in the country, “next to us” simply means within a mile of our home.I imagine one’s answer depends on what particular community and what particular individuals are around you. There are a few Amish out here to avoid, just like there are English (non-Amish) we also avoid. However, the majority of the Amish people we know are part of a tightly-knit, warm, friendly community who seek to avoid involvement with the outside world as much as possible. They do not invite people to watch them live. They are polite and respectful to the rest of the world, but do not seek to be close friends with them.They avoid technology, but so what? I managed to grow up in the 1950’s and 1960’s with very little technology and am none the worse for wear. Our parents can say the same for their childhoods. I taught high school for many years and have watched technology in the lives of our kids dumb them down and rob their sense of creativity.The Amish have been some of the best neighbors we have ever had. They walk over to our house to use our phone for free. In exchange, every time the husband comes over to use the phone, we ask if he can pick up something too heavy for my husband and me to move. Or use his chain saw to cut up a tree blocking our trails. Or get a gallon of the “white gas” (Coleman fuel) they use for their lamps. I give the wife a ride to town (twenty miles) to get groceries and we both get groceries at the same time, and then she gives me vegetables from her garden. When I had a major operation, she brought over meals for us to eat. When she teaches in the local Amish school the first two months of the school year (until the regular teacher gets his crops harvested), I give her school supplies from my many years of teaching.If the Amish say they will do something, then they will do it. We keep our promises, as well. We consider ourselves to be very fortunate to have wonderful neighbors, who happen to be Amish. They feel the same way about us. It’s simply called being a good neighbor. We both help in any way we can help. When you live in the country, being a good neighbor is essential for all of us.We both understand that we are from two entirely different cultures, and we respect each other’s differences. I keep my cell phone away from their kids. When we drive somewhere, the car radio, is turned off. She doesn’t look at me in my summer shorts and short sleeves, and address me as a prostitute. We don’t have to agree on everything, but we do need both to be as helpful to each other as possible, and that is something that we both happily do. There are many common values and faith in God that we all share. We both feel blessed to have each other as neighbors.","2,286 followers",Sage Kadow,1.3K,13.6K,4.1M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-main-objective-of-wireless-technology

Their lack of education, experience and training hinder them from being accepted outside. They have little to no support outside their familial community which won’t support advanced education, as the adults understand that will lead to the kids leaving the community.It’s like a horrible tease for these Amish kids to see for the first time what lies beyond their scope of the world and discover they cannot fit in.Pinterest","6,841 followers",Sharyn Wolf,47.3K,1.9K,13M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-could-we-learn-from-the-Amish-to-improve-our-way-of-life

11,"I’m responding to this only to counter an answer that I found somewhat insensitive. I’ve spent a good 20+ years of my life in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, so I feel qualified to answer this question.First, no one, not even the Amish, are keeping the Amish in servitude. They have the right to leave the church and the community as they like, and the practice of “shunning” is reserved for egregious behavior, not just for leaving the church. I have a very good friend (named Amos, just imagine!) who is ex-Amish and is one of the coolest people I know. He also seems to be a hit with the ladies, becauseI’m responding to this only to counter an answer that I found somewhat insensitive.

I have a very good friend (named Amos, just imagine!) who is ex-Amish and is one of the coolest people I know. He also seems to be a hit with the ladies, because he’s very trustworthy, I think.Second, Amish women are hardly abused or mistreated. Sure, there’s an understood division of labor between men and women, but the reality of it all is that are pretty equal partners in life. Heck, I know more than a few Amish women who wear the pants in the family, so to speak. The husband will of course complain to his mates, but he knows he’s in good hands, so he doesn’t complain so much.Amish women run their own businesses at markets across the county, bringing in cash to the family. I buy all my fruit trees from an Amish couple in the southern end of the county.The Amish make frequent compromises with the “English” ways, which are debated and approved by the bishops. In recent years we’ve seen the Amish being allowed to use electricity in their barns and for business, modern machinery for woodworking, and cell phones for business purposes. But you’ll still see plows drawn by a team of draft horses. the laundry drying on a clothesline. and the house lit at night by lantern. Foot-powered scooters are all the rage among the youth now. I’ve even seen Amish women inside Victoria’s Secret, checking out the merchandise. It looks like they’ll be allowing bicycles pretty soon. If there’s anything I don’t like about the Amish ways, it’s that some (but not all) treat their animals like animals…T EDIT: There have been credible reports about sexual abuse against Amish girls,and we take those allegations seriously. Craig Stedman has been a driving force in this problem, and I don't think that he will quit. Amish girls are encouraged to “ forgive the attacker, and strongly discouraged to report abuse. There are problems, no doubt.Whereas many might consider the Amish uncouth, unwashed, and uneducated louts The thing to understand about the Amish is that they distrust modern society, considering it a barrier to understanding with the divine, and everything that they do and believe in with regard to us “English” is predicated upon that belief.So they purposefully lag behind the English (that’s the rest of us, btw), but not so far behind that they can’t prosper. The Amish control huge amounts of wealth in this county, mostly in valuable land.They will make accommodations where necessary to preserve their business interests - and they are shrewd business people. They are really very friendly, and enjoy the gab just like everyone else. They don’t huddle amongst themselves, but at least here in Lancaster are very much a part of the larger community.Teens often own cars and get into trouble just like every other teen. They are baptized late in life (the Amish believe that baptism must be witting and voluntary, so you must be of age to accept that). They have some years after blowing off some steam as teenagers to either join the church or not (but this is not an irrevocable decision). I’ve seen buggies parked at the watering hole, where the Amish guys flirt with the English ladies (and vice versa to some degree). The barn parties are legendary. And just like us English, a lot of marriages occur when the couple is already expecting a child. Amish men can’t fib about their marital status - once married, they must sport a beard. When you see a clean-shaven Amish man, he’s not married.They aren’t necessarily any more law-abiding than anyone else: More than once I’ve seen Amish kids trying to hide that they were hunting out of season.The Amish church is really entirely voluntary. Children are given every chance to leave - the fact that so many of them remain is really a testament to the resiliency of that culture. By the way, they tend to make the most awesome pies. If you’re ever in Lancaster, by all means, seek out the Amish and have a good chat. And buy a pie.To finally answer the question: What you can learn is simplicity. You don’t need all the stuff you have - it’s just stuff. What you need are relationships with your fellow women and men, and if you’re so inclined, with your god. You should live more slowly, and you ought to live in a way that empowers you - that is, to be more or less self-sustaining and have a relationship with the land. You would be wise to turn away from the material world and find your bliss in those other things. Everything else is really pretty unnecessary.PS fun facts: Esther Schmucker of the old HBO series “Amish Mafia” is ex-Amish, and has been in trouble with the law more than once (and btw, there is no such thing as an Amish Mafia, if you didn’t already know that). Some years ago two Amish teens got into serious trouble for dealing cocaine - my only gripe is that they seemed to have received special treatment from the authorities since the issue was remanded to the church.

Often people see the outside, the wealth they have, the quaintness and miss the horrors that are common among them.Suicide, incest, beatings until death in the name of punishment, lack of access to medical care, isolation, is very common. If you are a part of a healthy community, often you have people from the community around you, but if you disagree, they use social isolation to make you realize the wrongdoing. This keeps the control very tight.So, if we want to learn how to control a society, they are great to learn from.

We would drive endless miles of backwoods and see little rickety signs that said; eggs, honey, & bread for sale next the road. It was literally the land of “milk and honey”, and sometimes I reminisce about those days. We would pull up and pay ridiculously cheap prices for homegrown food that would retail for triple the price at Whole Paycheck. They had delicious baked goods for sale and they were very industrious people. They had big families and all the children had important roles in the family structure. Sometimes it was dangerous work, it wasn’t uncommon to see a 5 year old boy helping in the wood mill. There were fairly frequent injuries and sometimes deaths of children just from the dangers of everyday life. Before you gasp and get upset realize this is their way of life, and the children are vital to the farm operations. It’s not like it’s a case of we need to call CPS, they are generally very responsible people, but farm life is hard and dangerous at times. The ones I knew were also very religious and Sunday everything was closed and it was a day of rest and prayer. The little bakery we used to visit was full of religious and moral sayings plastered on the table and hanging on signs. They do not like their picture being taken so if you happen to visit please refrain from acting like a tourist.

To disregard your friends spiritual counsel will deeply offend him. To disrespect and ignore church leaders may result in excommunication, which means humiliation and rejection to many Amish. Excommunication means you cannot ever eat with your family again unless you make a public confession and return to the Amish, and excommunication also bars one from partaking in Communion.So you want to leave the Amish? For most Amish this means excommunication. The Amish church my family left is quite liberal, so none of my family is under the ban yet, but that is not the norm in most places. We also were given some leniency because were are originally from the “world”.Being Amish is a lot of fun sometimes. I was lucky to have great friends (still do!) who thought a lot like me, and we had a lot of fun building snow ramps in winter and snowboarding off, mountain biking on severe terrain on some of the best mountain bikes available (most Amish are very wealthy), and we had fantastic sleepovers where we stayed up all night drinking Monsters and discussing various intellectual topics.But everybody has to grow up. My friends have felt the pull to join the church, and they all have except for myself. My best friend already regrets joining. He was deceived into thinking that he would gain respect if he joined the church, and it was only after he joined that he realized that nothing was going to change for him. He wants to leave but he has to work through all the misconceptions drilled into you as an Amish teenager.Being a teenager in the Amish sucks. There is no chance for higher education, and no chance at using any higher education you have. You have no respect, and you have no voice in church operations. Your behavior is scrutinized constantly to make sure you match everyone’s individual expectations of how you should behave. Any “worldliness” (ordering pizza delivery, wearing Under Armor winter beanies) is detected as soon as possible and rooted out.Being Amish is not cake and ice cream like some novel writing idiots would want you to believe. I haven’t even mentioned the very hard labor involved with the lifestyle, and the lack of conveniences that make life so much easier, no electricity, no refrigeration (in the church I was in), no modern washing machines, etc.",2 followers,Rana Ashish,29.7K,316,27M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-could-we-learn-from-the-Amish-to-improve-our-way-of-life

Many times they didn't even ASK, countless pilots would find their names on the sign up sheets despite the fact they never accepted the offer.Japanese society is very different than Western society. In Japan the desire to conform is almost impossible to resist. This is how it would often go:CAG: We need pilots that are willing to do whatever it takes to damage the enemy. I believe all of you are fully willing to do so. However, if you wish to decline to serve the Emperor, stand up and state so verbally.” That's an extraordinary amount of peer pressure they put on these young men. They didn't want to be seen as cowards in front of their comrades, and were often afraid their families would face some sort of punishment should they refuse the call to serve.These pilots often had extreme nervous breakdowns in the days leading up to the missions they were to be assigned to. The stress was so intense that in those run up days, they were given truly epic amounts of cocaine in their tea in an effort to calm their minds and fortify their courage.The other misconception is that kamikaze pilots never returned from missions they were assigned to, that they would crash into insignificant ships or even into the water if they couldn't find a target. Not only is this untrue, it's actually not the way they were instructed. They would be given pamphlets that said “Do not waste your life for no reason. If there are no suitable targets for your attack, there is no shame in returning to base.” They didn't want their pilots to sacrifice their lives just to damage some rickety cargo ship. Many kamikaze pilots did end up surviving the war.The zealotry of the Japanese, while certainly rooted firmly in reality, is far less black and white as people assume. Japanese soldiers often refused to surrender, instead fighting to the death, because they were genuinely terrified of what might happen to them should they be taken prisoner by the Allied powers. Very rarely was it out of a suicidal desire to die gloriously in combat for the Emperor. More often, it was because they thought death would be preferable to capture.",6 followers,Mats Andersson,1.3K,20K,369.9M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-could-we-learn-from-the-Amish-to-improve-our-way-of-life

The French have never quite forgiven us for winning a war that most of them abandoned.The American ‘myth’ is that US forces ‘saved Britain’s bacon’ and, therefore, the world’s. If nothing else, it’s a self-serving exaggeration. There is absolutely no question that America’s armed forces and industrial guaranteed the Allied victory and the world is appropriately grateful. No one has ever questioned the significance of the contribution made by the United States but it was only one part of a much larger story.Sadly, some American commentators and self-styled ‘amateur historians’ (though by no means all) seem to see the war as a sort of zero-sum game in which everyone but them has to be a loser.Understandably, those of British, Canadian, Indian, Australian, New Zealand and South African descent, feel a degree of resentment at comments that seem to belittle their contributions to victory.I am just as sure that those brave souls who escaped Occupied Europe to continue the fight from the British Isles feel exactly the same way. The Free French, Polish, Danish, Dutch and Norwegians have never claimed that they “won” the war but they, too, made a difference.Some Britons like to claim that Britain “stood alone”, but of course, this too is something of a myth. Britain was never alone. The support that was given to Britain by the Dominions and Colonies never wavered. Even India, which aspired to total independence from Britain, didn’t hesitate to commit hundreds of thousands of its troops to the war effort.Even with its hands tied by an isolationist public, the United States government under President Franklin Delano Roosevelt did what it could to bend its own Neutrality Acts.Canada’s ‘myth’ (if we have one) is that we are a ‘polite, peace-loving’ nation without a military tradition. It’s a ‘myth’ that’s been perpetuated by a series of federal governments that seems determined to downplay the achievements and sacrifices made by our armed forces in both world wars. It’s a position largely dictated by our French-speaking minority without which no party can long hold power.Even now, Canada has no WWII national monument or memorial. Until 2003, there was little evidence of the Canadian presence in the D-Day landings other than the Canadian military cemetery at Bény-sur-Mer. When the Juno Beach Centre was completed, it was only through the efforts of individual Canadians, veterans, and private donations. Governments were eventually shamed into participation but, as someone rightly observed, much of the government contribution to the centre seems to focus more on Canada’s history of multiculturalism than it does on WWII.",0 followers,Robert Marian,594,281,128K,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-could-we-learn-from-the-Amish-to-improve-our-way-of-life

Mcavoy/The LIFE Picture Collection—Getty ImagesThe big one and the one I get asked all the time and the one I’ve spent most of my career debunking is the notion that FDR knew aboutFrom the beginning, there was a group of scholars you could call revisionists, who have this whole theory that FDR maneuvered us into war by the back door.

In the inter-war period, he taught tactics at the German war school. He caught Hitler’s attention one day, and Hitler completely sponsored his career, made him what he was. Eventually Rommel got to command a pretty big force in North Africa,But he can never win anything lasting. He never, for example, gets to the Suez Canal. Why? Because he doesn’t care about logistics. He just thinks logistics and supply are someone else’s problem. Logistics is everything in the fight in the desert. Every bottle of water, every shell, every replacement tank tread had to be shipped from continental Europe across the Mediterranean to North Africa. It’s not like you just go to the store and pick one up. Logistics is the art of modern war. It’s not just running around the countryside. Rommel was good at running around the countryside, but he wasn’t particularly good at admin. His final act was to try to ward offMyth: Hitler was solely to blame for the German defeat in World War IIAdolf Hitler (center, in glasses) and members of his General Staff review plans for 'Operation Bodenplatte' (also known as 'the Great Blow'), an airstrike in support of the Ardennes offensive, late 1944.Heinrich Hoffman/The LIFE Picture Collection—Getty ImagesThis notion is in 90% of the books written on the war in Europe, which is that every mistake, every wrong turn the Germans made, every stupid offensive they decided to launch, was Hitler’s idea. I’d love to blame Hitler for everything; he certainly started World War II, and he’s the author of the Holocaust, there’s no doubt about that. But he certainly wasn’t responsible for every bad decision that the German Army made and every rotten offensive it undertook and every wrong turn it made, becauseWhen German generals wrote their memoirs after the war, they told this fable of “Hitler put us all in jeopardy.” But they’re conveniently forgetting the enthusiasm with which they carried out his plans, and they stayed loyal to the very end. The top German officers, the generals, bear a large share of the responsibility for unleashing the war, for fighting the war, and for keeping the war going long past any chance of victory.Myth: Japan could have won World War II, if only the Japanese had bombed the oil depots at Pearl Harbor in addition to the shipsThe USS Shaw exploding during the Japanese attack on the U.S. Pacific fleet at their base in Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941, on the island of Oahu, Hawaii.Keystone—Getty ImagesI hear this one all the time. Many analysts say that Japan should have hit the oil depot, the oil tanks, the port facilities, the repair hangers.At most, I think that have might delayed U.S. victory a few months. Japan didn’t want to conquer America. I just don’t see the Japanese sailing to California and fighting their way ashore, certainly not fighting their way across the country to the other coast. What Japan wanted was a sort of limited war: destroy our fleet and build a big Pacific empire free of American interference while we were rebuilding our fleet. By the time we were ready for action, Japan’s defense perimeter would be so strong that the United States wouldn’t have the will to fight its way across the Pacific.Sunday morning is a special time—at least it still was in America in the 1940s—and that surprise Japanese attack on a clear blue sky meant that Americans were ready to do just about anything, to make any sacrifice, to indeed, fight their way across the Pacific. There are bigger issues at play than whether Japan destroyed the fuel tanks, because we would have rebuilt those fuel tanks, and we would have come at Japan at some point.Myth: There was a turning point in World War IIAmerican shock troops huddle behind the protective front of a landing craft as it nears the beachhead on the Normandy coast of France (Omaha Beach) in front of Vierville-sur-Mer, June 6, 1944.

Without American supplies of food (not part of lend-lease and not counted as such) Soviet Union loses the war, period. Soviets starved wholesale even with copious amounts of food aid and hungry armies are dead armies in short order.If you assume that food reaches the Soviets anyway reality kicks in all over again. You see, the actual reality is Germany not only had the manpower and industrial base to win against the Soviets, it was winning the war of attrition until late 1943. Forget the defeats at Moscow and Stalingrad, so long as every German soldier killed two Soviets Germany was going to win the war in the long run. Stalingrad was a painful defeat sure, but the ratio of losses was exactly where it needed to be: two Soviets for each German. At Kursk the German defeat was a victory in disguise, four Soviets lost for each German, at Moscow it was six to one. The USSR couldn’t sustain this in perpetuity, the country was within months of running out on human flesh for the grinder.It’s commonly assumed the fact 80% of German war dead on Eastern front is what should be counted. The number isn’t just misleading (it’s 60%S'ils tombent, nos jeunes héros,Or in English:If they fall, our young heroes,Producing more humans to fight is easy and done with minimal government expense. The hard thing is to provide them with weapons and ammunition. The Eastern front only consumed approximately 20% of German industrial output (estimates vary, but none are above 40%) in 1941–45 period, the rest was aimed at the Westen allies. The standard G7a torpedo cost 50,000 RM. The number probably doesn’t tell you much. Let’s put it this way:You can have two of these for a single salvo aimed at a convoy, or else a whole platoon for the standard load of a single Type VII submarine, good for a single patrol. There were over 700 Type VII sumbarines in service and many served more than one patrol.Myth number 2:French war planning left something to be desired in the plan to hold Belgium in that Belgium didn’t turn out to be the fortress-nation it was in the first world war and in the speed of communication.

Euromaidan PressThe Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact Harmed the USSRA common myth has it that the 1939 German-Soviet Nonaggression Treaty, AKA the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, signed a week before Germany invaded Poland, was calamitous for the USSR. While Stalin proved disastrously wrong in trusting Hitler to honor the agreement, and in stubbornly ignoring warnings of impending German attack in 1941, the fault lay with Stalin, not with the Pact. The Pact itself actually served Soviet interests, and while they did not make the best use of it, they were better off for having signed it.From a Western and Polish perspective, the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact was calamitous. But from a Soviet perspective, it made good sense. The Western Powers had demonstrated their unreliability during the Munich Crisis, exhibiting greater distaste for dealing with Stalin than with Hitler. The Soviets made solid offers to defend Czechoslovakia, but the Poles refused them permission to march through Poland to reach Czechoslovakia, while Britain and France negotiated halfheartedly and ended up appeasing Hitler.After Munich, the USSR had something to offer both sides. The Germans negotiated seriously and made attractive offers, while Britain and France did not. And the Poles, looking at the only force that could physically come to their defense, were astonishingly shortsighted.The Pact bought the Soviets nearly two years in which to prepare for war. Poor as the Soviet military’s performance was in 1941, it was even less prepared for war in 1939. Moreover, the Pact, which gave the USSR nearly half of Poland, pushed the Soviet borders hundreds of miles westwards, giving the USSR that much additional buffer. Space and distance proved decisive to Soviet survival in 1941: the Germans came within 10 miles of the Kremlin before they were turned back. Without the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, the Germans would have launched their invasion from a start line hundreds of miles further to the east. The same effort that ran out of steam within sight of the Kremlin, would likely have pushed far beyond had it started hundreds of miles closer to Moscow.As the Soviets saw it, they owed the Western Powers and Poland nothing. Indeed, they had outstanding border claims against Poland. The Germans offered to satisfy those claims, while the British and French offered little. Indeed, seeing how they would be the ones expected to do the bulk of the fighting and dying in a war against Germany, it seemed like chutzpah to the Soviets for Germany’s foes to offer so little in exchange for the high price the USSR would pay for siding with them, instead of entering a benevolent neutrality with Germany.Operation Sealion. WikimediaGermany Could Have Successfully Invaded BritainBritain was not as vulnerable to German invasion as is commonly thought. After the humiliating evacuation from Dunkirk and the collapse of Britain’s main ally in 1940, the British stood alone against the German juggernaut. Things were grim, and to their credit, the British, led by their indomitable prime minister, soldiered on and fought the good fight when the easier course would have been a negotiated peace that left Hitler Europe’s hegemon.Propaganda painted Britain as a plucky and stolid underdog, gritting its teeth and girding its loins to repel an invasion that could come at any day. However, Churchill and Britain’s higher ups were aware that a German invasion, had it been attempted, would have stood no chance of success. Their main concern was not to repel an invasion, but to maintain public morale to continue what they knew would be a long and costly war, despite a dismal start.Churchill’s confidence came down to one word: logistics. The Germans simply lacked the landing craft and shipping capacity to transport and supply an invasion force large enough to subdue Britain. The main reason why the D-Day landings occurred in 1944, instead of 1943 as US commanders wanted, was the lack of sufficient landing craft in 1943. That problem was even worse for the Germans in 1940-1941.Even as the aerial Battle of Britain raged in the summer of 1940,While Britain’s leadership did not fear invasion, they wisely kept it to themselves: public morale and spirit of defiance were high in the face of an “imminent invasion”, and there was no reason to tamper with that and risk complacency. Moreover, the image of an endangered Britain played well across the Atlantic, enhanced American public and governmental sympathy for Britain, and solidified US willingness to support the British.German supply column mired during the Rasputitsa on the Eastern Front. QuoraGermany’s Invasion of the Balkans Delayed and Doomed the Invasion of the USSRThis myth has it that Germany’s invasion of the USSR, which supposedly ground to a halt because of Russia’s winter, would have succeeded if it had only started a month or two earlier than its actual launch date of June 22, 1941. The reason it did not start earlier, goes the myth, is because Hitler got entangled in the Balkans, invading Greece and Yugoslavia in April of 1941, which delayed the launch of Operation Barbarossa.The first flaw in the myth’s logic is that it gives winter top billing for stopping the German advance. However, other factors such as fierce Soviet resistance, the over extension of German supply lines to the snapping point as theThe myth’s main flaw is that, if Barbarossa had been launched two months earlier, in April instead of June, it would have been even less successful and ground to a halt earlier, after advancing a shorter distance. The Germans advanced as rapidly and plunged as deeply into the USSR during the summer of 1941 because the months-long dry weather perfectly suited theirIf the Germans had invaded in April, 1941, their advance would have churned to a standstill after only a few weeks because of theAmerican battleship sinking during Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. Encyclopedia BritannicaFDR Knew of the Pearl Harbor Attack in AdvanceOne of the more pernicious myths, which first surfaced during the 1944 presidential campaign, claims that FDR knew in advance of the Japanese plan to attack Pearl Harbor, but allowed it to happen in order to bring the US into the war on Britain’s side against Germany. Aside from the absence of any evidence to support the myth, the claim is irrational and illogical.The myth stems from the fact that American cryptanalysts had cracked Japanese codes and gleaned messages indicative of hostile intent, but that did not specify the when and where of Japan’s aggressive designs. Warnings were issued to American commanders throughout the Pacific, but the ones in Pearl Harbor failed to take adequate precautions – as did Douglas MacArthur in the Philippines, who was also caught unprepared despite the warnings.As to the myth’s illogic, while FDR saw Nazi Germany as the world’s greatest menace, and was busily rearming and preparing the country for what he deemed the inevitability of war against fascism, there is no causal nexus between allowing the Japanese to bomb Pearl Harbor and the US going to war against Nazi Germany. It was Germany that FDR wanted to fight, not Japan. The Japanese attacking the US would have resulted in war against Japan, not in war against Germany.The only reason the US ended up in a war against Germany was because Hitler, to the consternation of his generals, declared war on the US when he had nothing to gain, and everything to lose from gratuitously adding to his enemies the world’s wealthiest country and greatest industrial powerhouse. Absent that irrational decision on Hitler’s part, there is little reason to think that Congress would have declared war against Germany, which had not attacked America.Even if there had been a logical link between a Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor leading to war against Germany, FDR’s alleged goal of getting the US into the war would have been accomplished just as well if US forces had been prepared. A Japanese attack defeated by alert US forces would have still been an act of war by Japan. Roosevelt would still have gotten the war he supposedly sought, without thousands of American servicemen and civilians getting slaughtered. The US Navy could have ambushed the Japanese and sunk their fleet before it launched a single plane against Pearl Harbor, and its mere presence in the vicinity of Hawaii would have been sufficient indicia of Japan’s hostile intent to justify war.Malay plantations as seen from the air. QuoraThe Japanese Were Supreme Jungle FightersAfter Japan joined the war in December 1941, a perception developed among the Western Allies that the Japanese were preternaturally gifted ”jungle fighters”. The British in particular convinced themselves that their foes were “natural” jungle fighters during the Malay Campaign, when the Japanese, invading from the north, advanced the length of the Malay Peninsula, brushing aside or sidestepping all opposition, and captured the fortress city of Singapore at the peninsula’s southern tip despite being outnumbered by the British.However, Japan has no more tropical jungles than does Britain, and the Japanese had no more natural aptitude for jungle fighting than any other people whose homes lie well north of the Tropics. The Japanese prevailed in the Malay jungles because their troops were hardened veterans, while their opponents were inexperienced and ill trained.The Japanese were also innovative and adaptable, as illustrated by their vanguard’s commandeering of bicycles to speed up the advance, while the British commanders ranged from mediocre to incompetent. British generals, looking at all the greenery of the Malay Peninsula, assumed it was an impenetrable jungle, and thus never expected an advance on Singapore from that direction. When the Japanese invaded from the north, British generals set up defensive positions to block their advance, frequently anchoring their flanks to “jungle” on one or both sides.However, a significant portion of the Malay Peninsula’s foliage was not jungle, but plantations. They looked formidable when seen from the air, but on the ground they posed no barrier, comprised as they were of rows of trees with wide spaces in between, carefully cleared of underbrush, that formed straight leafy boulevards down which the Japanese easily bicycled or marched in the shade.Malay plantations as seen on the ground. QuoraOblivious British commanders in far off headquarters set up defensive lines that seemed formidable on their maps, with flanks secured by “jungles”, only to have those defenses outflanked by the Japanese strolling past them via the plantations surrounding British positions. Flabbergasted British commanders convinced themselves that an unnatural talent for jungle fighting lay behind the ease with which their foes outmaneuvered them, giving birth to this myth.Australian troops advancing on a German position during the Battle of El Alamein. The AtlanticThe North African Campaign Was Vital to Winning the WarThis myth goes that Hitler had grand designs in the Middle East, and that had the Axis won in North Africa and seized Egypt, they would have gone on to seize the rest of the Middle East and its oilfields, and, most importantly, gone on to win the war by outflanking the USSR and attacking it from the south. The concept looks good on a map, but it was unrealistic. Far from having ambitious plans for the Middle East, Hitler only got involved in North Africa in order to bail out Mussolini, and the Germans kept their investment in that theater to a bare minimum because they had greater objectives elsewhere with a higher claim on their resources.Had the Germans won in North Africa and conquered Egypt, they would have severed the Suez Canal, which would have discomfited the British and their supply lines to India and Asia, without severing them: at various times, the Axis managed to make the Mediterranean too hazardous for shipping, and forced the British to reroute around Africa and the Cape of Good Hope. It took longer, but the supplies reached their destination.However, grander designs about seizing the rest of the Middle East, or bigger ones such as using the region as a base to attack the USSR from the south, were nonstarters. The Germans lacked the shipping capacity to supply a force large enough for such goals. Throughout the North African Campaign, the Axis had struggled to keep the Italians and the Afrika Korps minimally supplied, and frequently fell short. This, with a force operating near the shortest supply routes from Italy.If the Axis lacked the shipping to adequately supply a force as negligible as the 4 German divisions of the Afrika Korps positioned nearby and close to the sea, it is inconceivable that they would have been able to supply a much larger force capable of overrunning the Middle East, or impacting the gargantuan war against the USSR, where the Germans and Soviets pitted hundreds of divisions against each other.French Resistance cell in Corsica, 1942. The EconomistThe Resistance Was Vital to Winning the WarA common myth, romanticizing the Resistance movements, particularly in Western Europe, has it that resistance was widespread and that the efforts of those clandestine groups tipped the balance in the Allies’ favor, spelling the difference between victory and defeat. It is true that Eastern European resistance movements, such as the Soviet and Yugoslav partisans, contributed materially to victory with intense sabotage and guerrilla activities.However, the greatest contribution of Western Europe’s resistance lay in intelligence gathering: their sabotage and guerrilla efforts were negligible. It took great courage, and the men and women of the Western European resistance risked their lives on a daily basis, but their impact was more symbolic than substantive, contributing more to the locals’ pride and self esteem after the war for having done something, than to the actual winning of the war.The disparity between the resistance movements in Eastern Europe and the Balkans versus those of Western Europe is due to the manner in which the German occupiers treated their conquered subjects in different parts of Europe. Jews excepted, German occupation of Western Europe, while severe, never approached the levels of psychotic cruelty and mindless brutality meted out to the conquered in Eastern Europe and the Balkans.With the exception of communists, who made a drastic turn from acquiescence to German occupation during the period of Russo-German friendship to fierce resistance after Hitler attacked the USSR, Western European civilian populations in the main did not exhibit a willingness to risk the horrific reprisals and atrocities the Germans were prepared to inflict upon restive subjects. It was not due to lack of courage, but lack of incentive. Because they were not treated as atrociously as were, e.g.; Soviet or Yugoslav civilians, Western Europeans’ backs were not as much against the wall to where they felt they had nothing to lose, and so never flocked to the resistance in the kinds of numbers that transformed it into a mass popular movement as happened in the Balkans and the USSR.During the war, the resistance in Western Europe was not as widespread or intense as is often depicted in film or fiction. Far more people were willing to accept German occupation and make the best of a bad situation than were willing to resist and risk German vengeance. E.g.; far greater numbers of Frenchmen collaborated with the German occupiers than joined the Resistance, whose numbers only boomed following the successful D-Day landings, after which late arrivals swelled the resistance ranks.Trinity Test, 15 seconds after detonation. Atomic Heritage FoundationHitler Was Close to Getting the A-BombThis myth has it that German physicists were on the verge of unlocking the secret of fission and giving Hitler an atomic bomb. During the war, the Manhattan Project operated on the assumption that Hitler had an advanced nuclear program which might bear fruit at any time. As such, those in the know viewed the US as being in a race against Germany over which country would first produce nuclear weapons.However, it was discovered after the war that the German nuclear program was nowhere near as advanced as had been assumed, because early in their research, German physicists took a wrong turn and followed it away from the path that leads to nuclear weapons. The war could have lasted another decade, and Germany would have been no closer to producing an atomic bomb in 1955 than she had been in 1945.Germany’s chief nuclear physicist, Werner Heisenberg, had nebulous ideas that splitting the atom could produce a powerful weapon, but he never understood how to put in practice nuclear fission. In Germany’s last test in the spring of 1945, scientists failed to achieve the preliminary first step of criticality – a self-sustaining chain reaction that the Manhattan Project achieved in 1942. Criticality was the crucial foundation without which an atomic weapon program could not have succeeded.Additionally, the German nuclear program lacked necessary support. After achieving criticality, it took the US nearly 3 years, with a massive investment of resources and the personal support and attention of the head of state, to successfully test the first atomic bomb. The Germans had not accomplished the criticality breakthrough by the time the war ended, and their nuclear program had never received anything close to the support enjoyed by the Manhattan Project.Lend-Lease convoy en route to the USSR via Iran. Historical Boys ClothingThe Soviets Could Not Have Won Without Lend-LeaseAnother myth has it that the Soviets could not have survived or won WWII without massive American Lend-Lease. Lend-Lease clearly helped, and Soviet successes in the second half of the war would not have been as dramatic without the hundreds of thousands of American jeeps and trucks that improved logistics and allowed for deep advances. And American airplanes were greatly appreciated – the Soviets’ second highest scoring fighter ace of the war downed most of his kills while flying an American P-39 Airacobra.However, the bulk of Lend-Lease did not arrive until 1944-1945, by which point the Soviets were already nearing victory. Indeed, meaningful amounts of Lend-Lease did not begin arriving until late 1943, by which point the Soviets had already halted the German advance and gone on the counteroffensive, rolling back German gains and beginning the relentless march westward that ended in Berlin and Central Europe.By the time the bulk of Lend-Lease arrived, the Soviets already had significant accomplishments under their belts and were well on the way to winning the war, including halting the Germans at the Battle of Moscow in 1941; major victories at Stalingrad and Kursk in 1943; liberating the Ukraine and reaching Poland in the winter of 1943-1944; and shattering Army Group Center in Operation Bagration in 1944.It all comes down to when the Lend-Lease equipment was delivered. USAdditionally, deliveries, especially during the war’s first year, were further delayed by a perception that the USSR might collapse at any moment, so Lend-Lease equipment could simply end up as German war booty. Because of such fears, on more than one occasion during the Soviets’ darkest hours in 1941-1942, ships loaded with Lend-Lease destined for the USSR were either offloaded and the equipment redistributed to the US military, or the ships were diverted to Britain and the equipment given to the British instead.Even when the goods were ready and fears of Soviet collapse had receded, it took years to establish reliable routes. Deliveries were initially routed across the Arctic Ocean to Murmansk, but it was a hazardous passage in which many convoys were decimated by German planes and submarines operating from Norway. The quantities delivered were more symbolic than meaningful, and were of use only in the peripheral Arctic fronts facing Finland.Another more meaningful was through Iran, which the Allies occupied precisely for that purpose, but the road and rail infrastructure necessary for the delivery of significant aid was not completed until the second half of 1943. Aid through this route went mainly to the Soviets’ southern fronts, which were more important than the northern ones supplied through Murmansk, but were not the main front.The main supply route, through which Lend-Lease finally gushed like a torrent, was through Vladivostok and thence across the Trans-Siberian railway to the central fronts and the Soviets’ main war effort. However, that was the most difficult route that took the longest time to establish, requiring not only significant work on the Soviet end, but the creation of an entire road and rail network from scratch, across Alaska and Western Canada, to handle the massive mountains of aid.Raising the Red Banner over the Reichstag. WikimediaThe Red Army Won Only by Weight of NumbersA myth developed during and after the war, propagated by German generals whose memoirs explained their defeat by claiming that their professional and technical superiority were undone by the Soviets swamping them with numbers. Running counter to that perception, before the war was even a year old, is the often ignored Battle of Moscow in 1941 – history’s biggest battle when measured by number of participants. During most of that battle, the Germans outnumbered the Soviets 2 million men to 1.4 million, yet the Soviets not only halted their foes, but went on the counterattack and pushed the Germans back 100 miles.During the war’s first year, Soviet performance, with some exceptions, was marked by incompetence and poor leadership. However, the Germans and bitter experience were good teachers, and by late 1942 Soviet commanders had become quite proficient. Indeed, many of the Soviets’ greatest victories resulted not from superior numbers, but from superior Soviet generalship. Examples include Operation Uranus in November, 1942, which caught the Germans by surprise and culminated in the surrender of a German army at Stalingrad, and operation Bagration in June, 1944, which completely wrong footed the Germans, shattered an entire army group (Center), and cost theDuring the first year of the war, particularly after the huge losses of Operation Barbarossa, the Germans frequently outnumbered the Soviets on the Eastern Front. The Soviets eventually gained a numerical superiority, and steadily widened the gap, but numerical superiority was not something they enjoyed throughout the entire conflict, and they did manage to hold on when they were outnumbered. By the war’s late stages, the Soviets achieved significant numerical superiority during offensive operations, but it was not because of unlimited manpower, but because Soviet commanders had grown adept at concentration of force, and because the necessary logistics had improved significantly.Stalin, especially early in the war, frequently overrode his military professionals’ advice and ordered ill-advised last stands or foolhardy attacks. Even without Stalin, Soviet commanders were more ruthless and less concerned about casualties than their Western counterparts. However, it was not a reflection of callousness, but a mark of their desperation early in the war, when they had to buy time at any cost. Later in the war, when on the offensive, it reflected a rational calculation that even a high price paid up front in an attack, so long as it resulted in an exploitable breakthrough, would translate into overall lower casualties, both in the medium term because losses during rapid advances following a breakthrough were lower than the norm while those of the reeling Germans were higher, and in the long term by bringing the war to a speedier end.Territory still under Japanese occupation (in blue) at the time of the atomic bombing. GifexThe Atomic Bombing of Japan Was UnnecessaryAnother of WWII’s persistent myths is the one positing that the atomic bombing of Japan was unnecessary because Japan was already reeling and on the verge of surrender. The Allies simply had to blockade Japan, goes the myth, and the Japanese government would have come to its senses sooner rather than later, and thrown in the towel. A variety of factors make that theory nonsensical.The first is that the war when the atomic bombs were dropped was not limited to the Japanese home islands and the choice of whether to invade or simply blockade them. Japan in August of 1945 still occupied vast territories in Asia and the Pacific, and misgoverned hundreds of millions of conquered subjects who endured daily horrors from their Japanese overlords, from casual brutality to torture, rape, murder, and massacres. Their suffering would have continued every day the war dragged on.Japan also had millions of soldiers stationed in her overseas empire, who were fighting millions of Allied opponents, producing thousands of casualties on both sides every day. Moreover, Japan held hundreds of thousands of Allied POWs, and subjected them to barbaric treatment every day, beating, starving, withholding medication from, or murdering them. Those casualties from continued fighting and from Japan’s atrocious treatment of POWs would have continued to mount every day the war continued.The main reason, however, is that the alternative to the atomic bombings would have been a massive invasion of the Japanese home islands, which the Japanese government was determined to resist via national suicide. Japan’s leaders were morally bankrupt and cowardly, and refused to confront the fact that they had taken their country into an unwinnable war and lost. Ethical leaders would have shouldered the responsibility for getting their country into such a fix, but Japan’s leaders sought to escape their burden via histrionics, and determined to immolate themselves and their country with them.So they sought to save face by training women to fight off heavily armed invaders with bamboo spears, and training little boys and girls to fight US Marines with pointy sticks. Rather than sacrifice themselves in order to spare their country, Japan’s leaders sought to sacrifice their country in order to spare their egos from the humiliation of surrender.Such dishonorable notions of honor meant that the estimated cost of an invasion was upwards of a million Allied casualties, and tens of millions of Japanese, the overwhelming majority of them civilians. Compared to that, the 200,000 casualties of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki atomic bombings were an acceptable price. Morally speaking, there was nothing exceptional about the innocent victims of the atomic bombings that would have justified sparing them at the cost of the millions of other lives that would have been lost elsewhere had the war continued.Hiroshima after atomic bomb. NBC NewsJapan Was Atomically Bombed Because of Racism/ Germany Would Not Have Been NukedAnother myth related to the atomic bombings posits that the bombs were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki because of racism against the Japanese. The theory goes that atomic bombs were not dropped on Germany, and would not have been dropped, because the Germans were Caucasian and neither the US government nor US public opinion would have stomached nuking them. The Japanese on the other hand were racially different, which made the decision to drop atomic bombs on them easier.While there was undoubtedly intense and vehement racism against the Japanese during the war, far exceeding that directed at the Germans, the theory is flawed for a variety of reasons. The first is that Germany surrendered before the atomic bomb was ready to drop on anybody. Germany surrendered unconditionally on May 8, 1945. The first atomic bomb was successfully tested on July 16, 1945, more than two months after Germany’s surrender.Additionally, the US atomic program, which began with a letter from Albert Einstein to FDR advising him of German research into atomic weapons and the danger should Hitler get an atomic bomb first, was viewed and pursued as a life and death race to beat Germany to the atomic punch. The entire goal of the Manhattan Project – itsMoreover, nuclear weapons were not viewed at the time with the same repugnance with which they are viewed today. Far from horrific last resort weapons whose use would be unthinkable except in the direst emergency, atomic bombs in August of 1945 were new weapons whose potential and impact had not yet been thought through. They were simply seen as another bomb, albeit a big and exceptionally devastating one. Modern abhorrence of nuclear weapons did not exist to the same extent when Hiroshima and Nagasaki were bombed, so if the US had atomic weapons before Germany’s surrender, there would have been little reason to refrain from dropping them on German cities.Source:This source may or may not help.",0 followers,Brent Cooper,692,7.9K,409.9M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-could-we-learn-from-the-Amish-to-improve-our-way-of-life

Only the first month of the war (September 1939) contributed to the creation of quite of an interesting list.September campaignIn the minds of many people in the West when it comes to September Campaign, there is complete ignorance or repeated stereotype of the Polish, ill-equipped army, which, in as much romantic as reckless elation, attacked numerous German tanks with sabers.Common knowledge of what happened during the first month of the war is very superficial, and often full of distortions and stereotypes created by war and post-war propaganda.Poland was not preparing for the war at all, which made it totally surprisedOne of the most common myths is that, as a country, Poland prepared too little for the war.It was a huge effort, practically every available penny was spent on the army. Of course, it was hard to keep up with the Germans, who due to their much greater economic potential, could spend more money on strenuous armaments, especially the production and purchase of the most modern equipment needed, but Poland tried to do so too.It is worth remembering that even in 1937, and even in 1938, the military potentials of Poland and Germany were very close, the moment of inevitable defeat appeared only after Hitler took over Czechoslovakia at the beginning of 1939. The takeover of the well-developed Czech military industry, allowed the Nazis from that moment to switch to armaments production in full swing.After the liquidated Czech army, the Germans took over a lot of high-quality equipment - 1,582 aircraft, 501 anti-aircraft guns, 2,175 artillery cannons, 200 tanks, later renamed PzKpfw Pz-35 (t), (which were technologically superior then the ones in German equipment).Nearly 500 combat vehicles were also acquired, 43 thousand machine guns, a million ordinary rifles and several million rounds of ammunition for them.This rapidly strengthened the combat capabilities of Hitler's army, and no one had anticipated it before (and could not have foreseen it), so it was difficult to prepare for it.Polish authorities disregarded the role of modern equipment, hence they had so few tanks and planes in 1939.The fact is that there were people (also in the command of the Polish Armed Forces) who disregarded the importance of armored forces, which in World War I were more of a battlefield decoration than an element determining its course.As the old saying goes, the generals are getting ready for the previous war, and there is indeed something to it, but it was not quite the case with the Second Polish Republic.The truth here is much more complex - the command and the authorities were well aware of the fact that the Polish army lacked modern equipment, so the preparations were made to change this state of affairs (including the great 15-year plan to modernize Poland).Firstly, the financial support was prepared and funds were raised for large purchases of equipment and armaments (in a gigantic move where the amount was exceeding two annual state budgets).However, war was not expected to start until 1942 or 1943, and the modernization schedule was prepared in such a way that the most modern equipment and machines - planes, tanks, which were only on the drawing boards at the end of the 1930s, could supply the Polish army with the widest possible stream until 1943.It was believed that if, for obvious reasons, Poland could not afford such extensive purchases as the Germans, so the buying should be delayed so that the army would be as saturated as possible, but only with advanced equipment (not in 1939, but in the year in which the war was expected, i.e. 1942 or 1943) .For example, the data on the planned production of cars in newly established Polish plants are interesting. In 1940, more vehicles were to be produced for military there than you could count all in 1939, on Polish roads!It is not true that there was no modern equipment in the Polish army. There was, although there really wasn't much of it. There are many examples, for example the perfect Polish anti-tank rifle wz. 35 Ur, capable of penetrating the armor of virtually all German armored vehicles.A very successful design was also the 7TP tank, which in terms of armor was second only to the newest German tanks PzKpfw III E and PzKpfw IV B-C, which, however, were still very few in the German army at the time.An interesting fact is that Hitler himself did not initially plan the war earlier than of 1942. The entire chain of geopolitical events contributed to the acceleration of the decision to invade Poland.Especially the system of clever ""guarantees"" that Poland received from France and the Great Britain, enraged the leader of the Reich and made Hitler, who had initially planned to strike the West first, to change his mind by 180 degrees. There are many indications that this was the right intention of the Polish ""allies"".The Germans had a totally motorized and armored army.This is one of the most common myths. Yes, the German army was definitely more saturated with cars and tanks than the Polish one, but the one who thinks that all German soldiers only drove trucks, as it is presented in the movies, is wrong.In September 1939, out of nearly 70 large units deployed against Poland (divisions and independent brigades), only 6 armored divisions and 4 infantry divisions were partially or fully motorized.The basis for transporting both equipment and people in the army of the Third Reich, even at the time of the invasion of the USSR, was, as in the Polish army (and any other armies at that time), the horse and the carts.Each German infantry division had about 5,000 horses in stock.The transport of rolling stock (i.e. logistics facilities) was entirely transported on horseback, including those ridiculed ladder carts.Horse transportation was just much more reliable than motorized transportation, especially in the absence of fuel, and that happened quite sometimes on the front.The secret of the success of the German invasions, both on Poland and later on France, was the innovative tactic. The fact that the Germans were able to use their motorized equipment in a masterly manner, amassing it in strong armored groups, which, like a spearhead, smashed the enemy's lines, rushing deep into its rear causing panic and disorganisation. The normal infantry dominated then in the rest of what had left of the front.Meanwhile, the French army in 1940 had even more tanks than the Germans but was crushed just as quickly as Poland. Precisely because the French ignored the knowledge of the tactics used in Poland and their own tanks were dispersed instead of grouping them, like the Germans, into compact armored units.The Germans ran across Poland like a roadroller, not encountering too much of the resistance.This myth is very widespread, especially in the Western world. The campaign in Poland was very easy for the Germans - it is commonly believed.Meanwhile, it was not like that at all. The German plan to attack Poland assumed the occupation of the entire designated area (from the secret protocol of the Ribbentropp-Molotov Pact) within two weeks. This failed and the Polish resistance was much stronger than the Germans expected.The biggest clash of the September Campaign, the Bzura battle, is often told as just ""Meanwhile, it was one of the largest battles of the entire Second World War, the largest one before the great clashes between the Wehrmacht and the Red Army on the territory of the USSR.Secondly, it was a Polish counterattack and the attempt to reverse the fate of the war, which turned out to be very effective in the first days of its duration.It was fought (during 12-13 days) on both sides (in the area from Stryków to Łowicz), by total of almost 30 divisions (including 5 armored) and as many as 650 thousand soldiers.In order to repel the Polish counterattack of the ""Poznań"" Army of gen.Tadeusz Kutrzeba on the wing of its 8th army commanded by Gen. Johannes von Blaskowitz, the Germans had to call over 1/3 of all forces that they had in Poland at that time, which stopped their all action everywhere in Poland for almost 2 weeks.The significance of the Battle of Bzura was enormous, which was greatly appreciated even by the Germans themselves. Already then, General Blaskowitz wrote in the order of the day to his soldiers about ""Years later the eminent strategist, Marshal Erich von Manstein pointed out that no similar action had taken place during the subsequent campaign with much stronger “The Luftwaffe managed to destroy the Polish air force on the first day of the war, when most of the defenders' machines were still on the ground.An example of this misconception was Martin Gilbert's statement in his 1989 war history that said ""Donald Watt's core work, “How The War Came”, proclaims something similar. A year later, John Keegan wrote that “In his monumental history of World War II, published in 1994, Gehrard Weinberg maintained thatAntony Beevor reiterated claims about the destruction of Polish aviation in his 2012 WWII story, writing: ""In fact, the Polish air force lost only 7 percent of its operational aircrafts on the first day of the war and took active part in the fighting for a total of 17 days - until the Soviet invasion.Revolutionary WehrmachtThe exploits of Wehrmacht in Poland is usually presented as an example of a revolution in military tactics and technology.Its great dependence on the seized Czechoslovak equipment and the fact that most of the German artillery was mounted on horseback (as in 1945) gets omitted.The German invasion appears in the pages of history books as an elegant operation, destined to success, where the armored divisions advanced at great speed, creating circles around the Poles.The truth is, three days after the start of the fighting, the Oberkommando des Heeres (OKH, Supreme Command of the Land Forces) decided to modify the plan by leading the 19th Army Corps (motorized) of Heinz Guderian's armored general from the Warsaw direction to Brest-on-the-Bug.The closing of the great circle around Warsaw, that can be seen on many maps, in fact never happened.The famous armored divisions, often depicted as unstoppable in 1939–1940, suffered a series of tactical failures during a short Polish campaign, such as the ""Kempf"" Armored Division near Mława on September 1 or the 4th Panzer Division in the suburbs of Warsaw on September 9.The even more catastrophic clashes at Ruszki and Kiernozia on September 16 are not mentioned at all in the existing English-language works.As soon as the Germans tried to attack fortifications or cities with tanks, the results were invariably meager. Upon closer inspection of the latest works, it can be seen that Beevor, Evans, Hastings, Keegan and Weinberg relied mainly on German accounts, and did not use any sources in Polish.So far, only a few historical works, such as “William Russ's ““That is why laziness or one-sided research allowed the war propaganda and stereotypes to shape the image of the Polish campaign of 1939 as something almost like a Wehrmacht victory parade.Nazis conquered Poland by using BlitzkriegAlthough Nazi Germany conquered Poland by carrying out several spectacular actions during its invasion, the victory over its neighbor did not yet fit perfectly into the Blitzkrieg framework, like in the model example, the campaign in France in 1940.Nothing is more offensive to Poland than naming the German actions in Poland, by the historians' with the term ""The Wehrmacht learned something from the battles of the Condor Legion in Spain in 1936–1939, but these forces were too small to be used as an example of operational activities.That is why the Polish campaign was a great experiment for the German Heer (land forces) and the Luftwaffe. Many organizational issues and many methods were unclear.At the beginning of the campaign, it was not decided whether it was the best to use tanks as an independent strike force or to directly support infantry units.Even the mechanized divisions were in a transitional phase; Panzer divisions had too many tanks and not enough infantry, while the Leichte-Divisionen (light divisions) quickly proved to be of the little use.In turn, the Luftwaffe did not cooperate with the ground troops as efficiently as the German propaganda claimed. According to modern terminology, the Wehrmacht in September 1939 was a ""beta version"" in which there were still many technical, operational and organizational errors.Unlike other campaigns, Heer was not a smashing army back then and had to use a bundle of the police and border forces on the offensive. Senior officers had well-founded concerns about the morale of the soldiers, and reported that to Hitler.Most of the German soldiers who took part in Fall Weiss did not know until the last minute that they were going to war; they were told that extended maneuvers awaited them. The marines assigned to the capture of the Westerplatte outpost in the Gdańsk port took training hand grenades with them.Hitler wanted to carry out a massive invasion of Poland instead of a surprising strike on Gdansk itself, because he had to make sure that the Wehrmacht was capable of quickly achieving operational goals before the great campaign against Anglo-French troops began.The Soviet invasion on September 17, 1939, was no longer significant for the course of the Polish defense.It is a view that was propagated throughout the years in the People's Republic of Poland and its main task was to weaken the sound of the USSR's invasion on Poland on September 17, 1939.Polish communists did not want the blame for the September defeat to fall on the later greatest ally of the People's Republic of Poland.It was easier to say that the Germans had already crushed most of the Polish forces by that time, and the Russians had entered Poland to protect the Belarusian and Ukrainian minorities living in the borderlands.Meanwhile, it was completely different story. The prolonged fighting in the west of Poland made Hitler seriously afraid of the intervention of the Allies and that is why he began to transfer some of his troops to the western border of Germany.Of course, this does not mean that if the Soviets had not attacked Poland with 650,000 soldiers, 4,700 tanks and over 3,000 aircraft, Poland would have a chance to win this campaign.Certainly, however, there were prospects that the defensive war could be significantly extended, and thus finally gain some - maybe even a material - support from France and the Great Britain.In the third decade of September, Polish defense began to harden clearly, and the progress of the German troops was not as spectacular as at the beginning of the campaign.Fatigue with the campaign and more and more serious shortages in supplies made itself felt to the Germans. The Poles managed to withdraw considerable forces to the East and, in the areas still controlled by the Polish authorities (over half of the territory of the Republic of Poland), there were significant mobilization resources that could have been activated.Third Reich diplomacy was fully aware of this and almost daily reminded the Soviets of their ""Hitler himself said after the campaign that ""In this situation, the Soviet blow of September 17 was completely unexpected (and here one can blame the Polish intelligence, which failed to catch on the Moscow's preparations).It caused confusion at the highest level of the command, it completely canceled the plans of resistance in the eastern part of the country, and the Polish Army was simply unable to face the two more powerful invaders at once.It was only from that moment that the real chaos and doubt began to creep into the Polish armed forces, because the previously planned operation of withdrawing the main forces beyond the Vistula line was basically already successful. After Russia struck, the situation became hopeless.The Poles, just crystal heroism.One of the common and false beliefs about those times is the myth that during the campaign Poland had lost, there were practically no attitudes of betrayal, desertion and mental breakdowns.Poles were heroes, fighting steadfastly from the beginning to the end ... Unfortunately, this is not the case, and it is not about the Supreme Commander who crossed the Polish-Romanian border on September 17, a common knowledge.Unfortunately, even among the leadership staff there were bad and even terrible attitudes. The first example is the commander of the ""Pomerania"" Army, General Władysław Bortnowski, who, as witness reports in the first days of the war show, simply collapsed due to the size of the enemy's advantage in the area he was supposed to defend.Instead of commanding divisions, after the great battle in Bory Tucholskie, he simply became a resigned and passive observer of the situation, and that had a terrible effect on the morale of his soldiers.Little is known about the story of the first commander of the legendary submarine ORP ""Orzeł"", who, after a strange indisposition, deserted it right at the beginning of the war.An even worse example was given to his soldiers by General Stefan Dąb Biernacki, commander of the strongest - at least in theory - of all September Polish armies: the ""Prussia"" Army, that was to be the reserve of the Commander-in-Chief.Unfortunately, during the first days of the fighting, he made a number of disastrous decisions that caused his troops to suffer defeat. On September 5, he escaped from the battlefield near Piotrków Trybunalski, and on September 6 he deceived the Commander-in-Chief that the defeat was the fault of his soldiers.He deserted for the second time after the battle of Tomaszów Lubelski, there were even accusations that he escaped from the front in civilian disguise.Unfortunately, there were many more such attitudes, although it must be honestly admitted that they were the exception and not the norm against the background of universal heroism.There were many wrong decisions on the tactical and strategic level. Here, however, it's hard to blame anyone. Poland had been in a war for which they were not prepared.So where do all these myths come from?Their source lies in the German and Soviet propaganda maintained throughout the Second World War, as well as in the post-war distortions of Western and Soviet military leaders and politicians who tried to minimize their blame for the outbreak and course of the war.Foreign historians are also not without fault, by treating the September campaign neglectfully, reproducing myths that are damaging to history.",0 followers,Alexandru Zaharia,2.2K,167,873.7K,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-could-we-learn-from-the-Amish-to-improve-our-way-of-life

The Japanese Naval Doctrine of ‘Kantai Kessen’ is a relatively passive, textbook re-imagination of the Battle of Tsushima. Japan does not want to win a war in the Pacific by the total capitulation of America. With the pre-war situation and American oil exports grinding to zero, Japan had to settle by shocking the U.S. so much in a ‘decisive battle’ to force them to sign an unfair peace treaty that would increase their holdings in the Pacific. One problem- the context of Russia as a country during Tsushima is different from American prior and during WW2.-Japan, as a country, cannot afford to take many losses. With no real supplies of natural resources except for lumber in their country, they have to rely on their colonial holdings and other countries like China in order to build much needed war materials. America is abundant in resources and was the world’s largest exporter of oil at the time. Losses, while demoralizing, could be replaced.-Due to the supply situation, Japan focused on quality over quantity. See creations like the Yamato-class, and the rigorous training of airmen.From this, it is evident immediately that Japan was also attempting to pull a ‘Pacific Blitzkrieg’, capturing Pacific Islands and depending on their resources until their ‘Kantai Kessen’ could finish their decisive battle and MOST importantly, before American war production could pick up the pace.If every American carrier had been sunk at Pearl Harbor- a rather far-fetched thought process- American production could crank into overdrive. Before the attack on Pearl Harbor- eight Essex-class carriers had been ordered. Following the attack, funds were drawn to order nineteen more (though only ten were ordered). If American had lost all their carriers, they would focus on naval air power even more.America can very much afford to play a stalling game in the Pacific until the Essex-class carriers arrive, in much greater numbers than the Japanese even if they do not lose a single carrier (not to mention their numerous advantages over their counterparts, as shown during Midway).

There are all kinds of down in the weeds details that tank historians and armored warfare specialists can get into, but no matter how you slice it, the Sherman’s bad reputation in some histories (particularly the earlier postwar works) was mostly undeserved and inaccurate.In the first place the M-4 was a medium tank. It was not conceived as, nor was it meant to fight as, a heavy or main battle tank.M4 Sherman Tank FactsM36 tank destroyer - WikipediaA Recent Photo of a Standard Configuration M-4 Sherman Tank.

The Main Gun Was Also Used in the M26 Pershing Heavy Tank.Although American tank destroyers were generally successful, it gradually became clear that in most cases, tanks themselves were the best weapon to use against other tanks.Which brings us back to the Sherman. Was it outclassed against the biggest and best German machines? Well, yes. But again we are talking apples-to-oranges. How well do most middleweight boxers or MMA fighters do against heavyweight opponents? Some will win, some of the time, but more often the bigger, stronger, heavier fighter prevails. It was the same in WWII with the Sherman.However, heavier and better armed variants, such as the M4A3E8 aka “the Easy Eight”, the M4A3E2 “Jumbo”, and the British-modified “Firefly” were competitive even against the best German armor. It was a Firefly that destroyed the Tiger tank commanded by the greatest Wehrmacht tanker ace, Michael Wittmann.Sherman Firefly v Tiger - Joe Ekins v Michael WittmanMichael Wittmann Stands in the Commander’s Coupola of His Tiger Tank While Heading for Combat in France Following the Allied Landings in 1944.“Michael Wittmann - The Death of Germany's Tiger Tank Ace”, a Historical Documentary Video From the Mark Felton Productions YouTube Channel.This M4A3E2 Heavy Armor Sherman Tank Was Refitted With a 76mm High Velocity Main Gun. Machines of This Type Were Often Able to Defeat The Best German Tanks.Even standard Shermans could sometimes prevail if they were able to position themselves for a kill shot at closer ranges against the thinner side plating on mostThe M-4 also proved to be effective against Russian-built North Korean T-34s during the Korean War, and upgunned Israeli “Super Shermans” were still blasting more modern Egyptian and Syrian machines from the battlefield during the 6 Day War in 1967.Now: were uncomfortably large numbers of Shermans, particularly the earlier models, destroyed by more powerful German opponents? Yes. Was the M4 helpless against them and a death trap for its crews? No, especially when later versions appeared in 1944–45. So, let’s move on from this myth.Myth Number Two: the Me-262 Was Invincible and Germany Would Have Won the War If More Had Been Produced Sooner.The Messerschmitt 262 “Schwalbe” (Swallow) Was the World’s First Effective Jet Fighter.The Me-262 was certainly impressive, and when flown by the Luftwaffe’s best pilots, it tore numerous American bombers to pieces. Yes, it was too little, too late, but if only Hitler hadn’t meddled in its production, the Germans would have had thousands of them a year or two earlier and that would have been that for the Allied strategic bombing campaign. Right?Wrong.Although definitely an improvement over propeller driven aircraft, the 262 was not quite the quantum leap forward that many believe today. Its maximum speed of about 540 mph was not dramatically better than the mid-to-high 400s achieved by late war Allied types, and the first generation turbojets that powered the German machine were a maintenance nightmare. I read somewhere a number of years ago that some P-51 Mustangs were field modified to make them lighter, and that these could reach 500 MPH in level flight. I don’t know if that is true, but it would not surprise me. P-51s used in non-military configurations in post-WWII air races reached 520MPH-plus, though again this was with the benefit of modern technology and at a far lower weight than when fully loaded in wartime.P-51 Mustang PerformanceThe point being that the German jet was not night and day faster than existing Allied piston engine fighters, which could be altered to close the gap somewhat. But even stock fighters were far from helpless against the 262, which was vulnerable when taking off and landing at far lower speeds than when it was attacking Allied bombers. Large numbers of 262’s were either shot down during takeoff and landing or destroyed on the ground by bombing and strafing attacks.In addition, both the RAF and the USAAF developed their own jet fighters during WWII. Although the British Gloster Meteor did not fully mature until several years later, had the war continued we can safely assume that the bugs would have been worked out sooner. Meanwhile the excellent American Lockheed P-80 would have given the 262 all it wanted, and then some. It was also a beautiful aircraft in my opinion.The Lockheed P-80 Shooting Star, Shown Here With Wingtip Extra Fuel Tanks, Entered Service at the Tail End of WWII.In short, the Me-262 definitely rode the wave of the future, and it was a nasty surprise for the Allies when it first appeared and for some time afterwards. It was good, to be sure. But it wasn’t great.This leads us to our third and final myth: the US Bluffed Japan Into Surrender Because it Didn’t Have Any More Atomic Bombs in the Wake of the Nagasaki Mission.Actually, the bombs that fell on Hiroshima and Nagasaki were not the first ones produced by the Manhattan Project. They were the second and third, respectively. The first was expended in a test detonation code named “Trinity” near Alamagordo, New Mexico, in July 1945. The fourth was already complete even as the second combat mission was hitting Nagasaki on August 9th. All of these devices except the second were Fat Man plutonium implosion bombs.The Trinity TestAccording to several primary source documents, the third atomic bomb used in combat would have been dropped on the Kokura Arsenal in Japan on or about 19 August, 1945. Again, this bomb had already been manufactured (though not yet fully assembled until it would have reached the B-29 base at Tinian Island in the Marianas chain) and was already making its way through the logistics pipeline on its way to the Pacific.William Pellas's answer to Where did they first try to drop the atom bomb but couldn't drop due to bad weather?The following transcript of a telephone conversation between Colonel L. E. Seeman and General John Hull indicates that at least seven (7) more atomic bombs would have been manufactured by 1 November, 1945—the date on which the invasion of Japan itself was scheduled to begin. It is not clear from the conversation whether Seeman was talking strictly about the Fat Man type and not whether any additional Little Boy bombs might also be ready, but I think this is likely given two memos from General Groves that mention one or two of the latter type also being completed ahead of Operation OLYMPIC.https://nsarchive.gwu.edu/documents/atomic-bomb-end-world-war-ii/087.pdfColonel Lyle Seeman, US Army Corps of Engineers, Served as a Special Assistant to General Leslie Groves, the Top Man in the Manhattan Project in WWII.Note that Groves had previously sent a memo to Joint Chiefs Chairman General George Marshall concerning the faster than expected completion of the third Fat Man bomb:https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu//NSAEBB/NSAEBB162/67.pdfMarshall gave consideration to the then-new atomic bombs as tactical weapons in support of OLYMPIC, and had in mind to use 9 of them for that purpose. This presumably meant that he had added Seeman’s estimate of 7 Fat Man bombs to Groves’ mention of 2 Little Boy types. Keep in mind that these are estimates, and under wartime conditions it is entirely possible that even more would have emerged prior to the invasion.

Their resistance to Hitler was basedMy two “favorite” myths — meaning the two I know the most about — are:Allow me to explain in turn.The July 20th Coup and Assassination AttemptThe coup attempt of July 20, 1944 was the culmination of years of resistance to Nazi rule on the part of a network of influential individuals both civilian and military. Their resistance to Hitler was based on profound moral objections to his ideology and his policies. Their numbers included theologians such as Dietrich Bonhoeffer, legal experts such asHelmut Graf Moltke, dipomats such as Dr. Adam Trott zu Solz and civil servants such as Carl Goerdeler. That military men seemed to be in the fore was a function of the fact that only the military had the means to depose Hitler in wartime.The first serious coup attempt by this core group that included Generaloberst Beck, General Stuelpnagel, and General Olbricht was planned for September 1938 — that is during the Sudenten Crisis and before the Second World War even started much less before it was lost. The commanders of divisons slated to invade Czechoslovakia were prepared to disobey Hitlers orders and remain in place while senior officers arrested Hitler and a panel of leading doctors declared him insane. The Munich Agreement that made it possible for Germany to secure the Sudetenland without war, robbed the conspirators of the pretext for Hitler’s arrest. (Below General von Stuelpnagel, a key figure in the plot at this time.)The core conspirators continued to plot against Hitler despite his early military successes and they made several daring assassination attempts before July 20. One of the most promising attempts entailed smuggling a ticking bomb aboard Hitler’s aircraft as he returned from a visit to Army Group Center on the Eastern Front. The fuse failed probably due to excessive cold or altitude. Had the bomb gone off, Hitler would have been killed in an explosion while flying over Soviet held territory. This would have enabled the coup leaders to seize control of the apparatus of government without being viewed as traitors and assassins — a huge advantage. (Below: General von Tresckow, who devised and executed this assassination attempt.)The fact that during the war years,the Resistance leaders recruited to their number men such as Generalfeldmarshal von Kluge and General Rommel — neither of whom shared the fundamental aversion to Hitler as the core leaders of the Resistance — has confused observers into dismissing all the conspirators as opportunists. Tragically, Hitler’s description of the conspirators as a “tiny clique of ambitious officers” still dominates modern images of the German Resistance.For more information about the history and people behind the July 20th Plot visit:Note: I earned my PhD with a biographical study of General Freidrich Olbricht, published by the prestigious German publisher Bouvier Verlag.

Every personal account by Battle of Britain pilots mentions the first-rate, dedicated, and unflappable ground crews, yet few modern accounts give them any attention at all.

Our neighborhood was picketed by German Wehrmacht soldiers who, unlike theirWhat started as a normal Sunday for me was soon abruptly interrupted by the dreaded sound of the war siren. To us, that meant only one thing, leave everything and rush towards the walnut tree. At the base of the tree, my father, who at the time was away, garrisoned somewhere in the territory, on stand-by and awaiting deployment to the front, had dug an air raid shelter and had left provisions for such a situation.Just as soon as all five of us got in the damp underground chamber lined by wooden planks and covered with sedge-weaved mats and we closed the hatch above us, the dark enveloped us. As the first bombs started dropping around the city with incredibly loud bangs and we laid down on the cold mats, we realized that in our rush we had forgotten to bring any candles and matches or to verify if there are any in the shelter. My older brother who was about 14 and the man of the house in father’s absence, decidedly raised up off the mats and went to grab the hatch to get out and bring some candles from the house.

Five thousand souls perished on the ground in Ploiești and Bucharest, mostly civilians, 440 American aircrewmen out of the 660 lost their lives.

But USSR just doesn’t go down.Meanwhile UK has asked his old mate USA to help. USA hesitates … until Japan hits him. In the face. With a chair. Germany laughs when he sees this, and taunts USA.Big mistake. Because USA is big. Scary big. FREAKISHLY big. And now he goes wild, kicking Japan and hitting Germany at the same time.Germany and USSR are still fighting, bleeding, screaming. UK and USA jump on Germany from behind and the three hit him with everything they’ve got: CRACK! Germany loses two ribs. KTOW! And another rib! TWOCK!! His jaw! SMASH! His kidney!Germany staggers. Then USSR lands a final sickening blow in his face … and Germany goes down.USA turns around. A final bone-shattering blow, and Japan just drops.The brawl is over.So why did Germany lose?

But still the pictures from those days are shocking.As a side note, I once talked to a very old woman from Berlin. She said, “When I was young I believed the Kaiser. He took us to war and my husband never came back. I was left a single mother. Then came Hitler and I believed him. He also took us to war and my son never came back. Then I was just an old mother without a child. The communists came and said that this time, everything would be better. I believed them. They took away the beautiful house my late husband built for me and gave it to someone else.

It’s just not possible to cover all the practical, strategic, tactical, geophysical and geopolitical, economic and political territory that makes up the many faces of World War II. So most Americans are left with movies and a diminishing supply of first-hand accounts.What they see, then, are movies about WWII that are barely snapshots of tiny pieces of a campaign or battle. Yes, “Saving Private Ryan” had a shocking opening sequence on the D-Day beachhead, and in the final battle in the town, but it was a movie, and a mythical one as well. From what I’ve gleaned from men who were there—on the beach, on the ships, in the planes flying overhead(my dad)—it was a nightmare, often full of fuck-ups, played over and over and over again for hours, and then days, and weeks as the American forces moved toward Berlin.Movies like “Tora Tora Tora,” or “Midway,” or “Twelve O’Clock High,” or “Patton,” “A Bridge Too Far,” “Letters from Iwo Jima,” “The Bridge at Remagen,” “Stalingrad,” ‘The Battle of Britain,” or even “The Longest Day,” simply cannot extend the verisimilitude of WW II beyond the surface of the screen on which the movie plays out—and that screen is always two-dimensional, and the audience can leave anytime. War is four-dimensional—it has width, depth, height, and the inexorable factor of merciless time— and for the soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines, or Coast Guardsmen who were suspended in those four dimensions for months, if not years, there was no way to casually leave the theater and go to dinner, or for a late-night drink with friends. Every day—every second—was real and capable of ending horribly.“Das Boot,” a fine 1981 film written and directed by Wolfgang Peterson, is one of the few movies I’d point to as showing the miserable life of a U-Boat crew in World War II. But it’s one of the rare films to portray the world of submarine warfare with enough claustrophobia and fear to give an audience the heebie jeebies. But for every “Das Boot,” there are a hundred other WW II movies that end up as unintended black comedy, insensibly unhistorical duds, or just flat out sugar-coated propaganda, lacking any legs of truth.Very few movie makers have attempted to show what happens in a B-17 as it flies through heavy flak over Europe, although parts of “Memphis Belle” were pretty bloody. But for the planes that were hit and began to spiral downward, filled with 10 men—some badly injured—who were trying desperately to get out amidst flames, screams, smoke, and the wild physical pressures of a spinning bomber, no movie has done that horror scene justice. And for the men who did make it out and survived to land in a field or forest, no movie has accurately portrayed the brutality of what happened when they were captured—”The Great Escape” is really that—a great escape from the reality of German prison camps.There are some exceptions, notably among documentaries that were either shot at the time, or incorporated battle scenes shot during the war. Henry Salomon’s 1952 26-part television series, “Victory at Sea,” is, to my mind, the quintessential guide to World War II seen through the eyes of the men who fought in it. Though it has a strong Pacific Theater bent, it is, nonetheless, a worthy movie based on you-are-there images and historical documentation.But, this reply is not meant to be a movie review; the question is about a persistent myth about World War II, and all I have tried to say here is that the overarching myth about the war is that it can be neatly categorized, populated with easy-to-identify heroes and villains, sanitized for popular consumption, and, all the while, telling the truth about that global conflict. It is a myth to think any such thing is possible.War is horrible and undefinable at the human scale. And that is not a myth.",UNKNOWN,TC,4.2K,179,7M,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-could-we-learn-from-the-Amish-to-improve-our-way-of-life

The warstarts in 1939 and they remain in the fight for over 2 years, yet we treat them as jokes.In reality, the French were tough. The Germans concentrated their tanks in armored units rather than dispersing them among the infantry and when the Germans broke through the Ardennes forest, the French were forced to fall back to avoid encirclement- and it didn’t work.The French were thrown into disarray by the German onslaught. France is not very big and they didn’t have much space to fall back. Regardless they tried though but sadly failed.Yet even after France fell, the French kept fightingFunny, the French Medium tanks were world-class and arguably better than the German Medium Tanks in 1941.France did not fall due to cowardice and the French military was not “bad” by any means. Germany pulled off a serious upset against France and yet even with the entire country occupied- the French fought on.3: The “Pacific theatre” was a conflict between the US and JapanThe Pacific theatre was as big as the European theatre and nearly as deadly. While in American we imagine this as island combat between US Marines and Japanese infantry when in reality it was so much more.In fact, the waritself was focused far more in China. The Chinese front was the second-deadliest of WW2. It was pretty much as deadly as the Western Front with 20 million Chinese people being killed in the war.This front is sadly ignored WAY too often and many have no real idea it existed. This is strange too considering the Sino-Japanese conflict was full of massive offensives, insane Stalingrad-like battles, and insanely large military clashes.",5 followers,John Smith,1K,0,0,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-could-we-learn-from-the-Amish-to-improve-our-way-of-life

They saw themselves naturally aligned with Japan and Germany. They were Germany’s main raw materials supplier. The Soviets saw this as an opportunity to pick up more territory.After long discussions and proposals, Germany presented the Soviets with a draft written Axis pact agreement defining the world spheres of influence of the four proposed Axis powers (Japan, Germany, Soviet Union, Italy). The Soviets would no longer just be a supplier but a full partner. However, the proposal did not give the Soviets all the territory they wanted.A few days later, the Soviets presented a Stalin-drafted written counterproposal with slight modifications where they would accept the four power pact, but it included Soviet rights to Bulgaria and a world sphere of influence focus on the area around modern Iraq and Iran. Hitler hesitated because of the oil in these countries.The deal never got made and Hitler decided to invade the Soviet Union rather than take them on as a partner. (Part of the decision was Hitler thought the Slavs were inferior) But if the Soviets and German had gotten together, they would have crushed Europe. The Brits would have been forced to seek peace.This was Churchill’s biggest concern. He knew the Soviets were supplying the Germans. If they joined them, Europe could be lost. That is why he embraced the Soviets so quickly when they went to war with Germany.
