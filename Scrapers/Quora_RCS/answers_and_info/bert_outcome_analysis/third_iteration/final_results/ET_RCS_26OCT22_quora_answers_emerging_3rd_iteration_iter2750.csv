Sure your physically body was there but as far as your concerned you went to sleep in 2018 and woke up on 2118.Another form could be what we see with relativity. Astronauts in essence comeback in time a very little bit after orbiting the Earth.Traveling to the future is actually the only form of time travel that we know we can do and wouldn’t actually be that difficult depending on your definition of time travel.For one, of you were cryogenically frozen for 100 years and you didn’t age during that period, in essence you time traveled.

This is more in the realm of science fiction but it is the most like time travel as the wormhole could allow people to pass into the future. What paradoxes arise from that could be complicated unless wormholes are only one way.Getting to the future isn’t that hard, we can already do it to a very small extent with today’s technology as seen with the astronauts.

6,I think a lot of reason that the United Kingdom has sadly lagged somewhat was because they won the war. The finest moment and their entire history like the Battle of Britain should be celebrated through the ages but it brought her to her knees and I think in many ways the country has never recovered from the war it didn't get the bailouts the others did. The US was scarcely touched at home and had a mammoth industry absolutely intact by the end. And England had better things to do during the cold war.,469 followers,Daniel Cohort,11.9K,377,1.2M,2021,https://www.quora.com/How-can-a-time-traveler-prove-that-he-is-from-the-future-without-having-to-show-some-advanced-technology

We simply instilled the concept of a trinity of super beings who collectively had the ability to speak a world; nay, an entire universe into existence, then selecting one of the planets to populate abundantly with lesser and greater plant and animal life.Furthermore, these super beings developed a set of rules and punishments in accordance with mankind being allowed to enter this afterlife. They also selected various men throughout history to establish a flow of communication between us and the super beings via these selected individuals called prophets. These prophets were enabled to both speak to and hear what the super beings wished to convey to the common man in order that he might rise by faith within himself, and be perfected in order to obtain unto this afterlife.‘However, there was a jealously that developed between one of the super beings an the rest of them with the result that him and his cohorts were displaced from having any further abode with the rest of the super beings, and was subsequently excommunicated and sent to find habitation on this planet.Now, as the story progresses, this disposed individual and all who followed him in his rebellion were stranded here. As a result they have systematically, ran interference between the super beings and mankind. Their most successful ploy was to invent a different way for mankind to obtain unto this ‘after life’ which of course was not the truth. Unfortunately, because it catered to mankind to play along, believing the lie to be truth, many people lost their chance to obtain unto perfection, thereby disallowing their entrance into this after life.

A bowler cannot be taught to bowl fast by any coach.Coaches can only help and nurture a young tearaway fast bowler to develop accuracy, control & variations.I feel no amount of technologies or techniques can teach a bowler to bowl genuinely fast, above 150-155 kmph.Techniques can help a medium-pace bowler to a certain extent, to slightly improve his speed, say, 125 kph bowler to increase his speed to 130-135 kph.They can help bowlers to avoid injuries by slight tweaks of action, and also help to develop new deliveries and improve accuracy and control.But I don't think any technique can help a bowler bowling 155 to make him bowl 160+.A genuine fast bowler's own ambition, motivation and continuous untiring efforts to become the fastest bowler in the world play a huge role to help him achieve that.This is again just my personal opinion.

12,"We haven’t yet found a way to inject fast twitch muscles into any human being!You can have any number of different ways to deliver a cricket ball at speed.

Some get it with a quick arm action, some with a smooth run up, some with the most blessed coordination between various parts of the body that work well in rhythm.But no human can generate any speed, flat out speed, of any part of the body without those blessed fast twitch muscles, which are purely genetic to start with, and then maybe honed for peak performance.Each bowler has his own or her own action and technique and it comes down to what action settles that bowler to bowl many deliveries repeatedly, that makes a career out of it. The fundamental mechanics of what comes naturally cannot be altered too much into a bowling career, only tweaked.So, for someone to bowl really really fast, a number of factors come into play like in the life of any star athlete. The statistical chance of getting a supreme athlete to decide to bowl and rise to prominence on the world stage is actually, surprisingly small. Simply because very few countries play the game at the highest level and offer the incentive for choosing fast bowling as a sport, compared to any other. So the cream of the world’s gifted athletic pool is still probably not leaning towards cricket. The West Indies team of the 80s may have come closest to setting up an assembly line of fast bowlers, pick who you might.Since then, tearaway quicks have indeed been fairly uncommon in large numbers, despite all the advances in biomechanics and sports training methodologies that build specific muscle groups for specific actions. All this said, 160 kph is a freak occurrence, that is not repeatedly displayed by any bowler. That is when all the conditions for a perfect fast release simply come together. It’s kind of like Bob Beamon’s long jump record.Some feats are just so freakish that it won’t be easy to simply train to beat them.Personally I wonder why there haven’t been any left arm tearaway quicks in that demonic speed region of fast bowling. Perhaps just statistics, since left arm bowlers are indeed rare in themselves, and the chances of a left arm freakish quick is that much diminished in comparison to a right arm tearaway quick showing up.Too many factors simply have to fall in place for such records to be broken. A sureshot contender for breaking such records might get left out of squads coming through the ranks because he simply isn’t good enough a bowler!I haven’t seen a wind speed conversation come up in cricket at all, when it comes to speed of bowling.It is also worth mentioning that the way bowling speed is measured has changed and favours the current crop much more than the older crop of fast bowlers to simply get clocked at higher speeds.I am still left wondering how different bowling speeds in the real world will be clocked for bowlers delivering the ball at vastly different heights. A taller bowler will put the ball on a longer path onto the pitch, towards the batsman and past the stumps. So, assuming the same release speed, the batsman facing a taller bowler with a higher release will be facing a less faster delivery, compared to when facing a bowler with a lower release point. This would be even more exaggerated because the ball is slowing down all the time in the air, and if it has to travel longer through the air, it will be that much slower.",UNKNOWN,Deep,1.6K,0,0,2021,https://www.quora.com/How-can-a-time-traveler-prove-that-he-is-from-the-future-without-having-to-show-some-advanced-technology

Who have played for decades and it's not the injuries curtailed their career. They played until they felt it's good time to bid adieu. Where as, the bowlers who focused more on speed had relatively shorter career, be it Shaun Tait or Shane Bond!Shoaib's career was always prone to and fraught with injuries.In many matches he could only bowl very few overs that had made the team handicapped. They had to resort to part time bowlers to fill the quota made vacant by their spearhead bowler! In batting also they weren't able to do much, so eventually become a “baggage” for the team..These days players and coaches are fully aware about the lucrative career in front of them. So they are satisfied with genuine speed which can be generated with their original bowling action. They are not very keen about those few extra yards. There are many players who can generate decent pace without much of an effort. Jofra Archer is one such bowler, India's Umesh Yadav is also capable of bowling over 150 kmph speed effortlessly.",148 followers,Tarun Khelani,528,0,0,2021,https://www.quora.com/How-can-a-time-traveler-prove-that-he-is-from-the-future-without-having-to-show-some-advanced-technology
