For going between cities and provinces, China has a high speed rail system in place that is more extensive than the American highway system! For example: I lived in a city called Nanjing in China - about 200 miles/300 km from Shanghai. I could take a high speed train from Nanjing to Shanghai in about 1.5 hours!In contrast, I took an Amtrak train from Detroit to Chicago (about 300 miles/480 km) and it took over 8 hours!Another area China wins at is public utilities. They provide electricity, water, and gas for billions of people for very affordable prices! I paid maybe a total of $20 (US) per month for all utility bills, whereas it cost me over $100 in America! Atop of that is wireless technology (which is considered a public utility in China). I paid 100 rmb ($15) monthly for 16 GB of 4G data, with 1000 texts and 500 minutes of talk (which pretty much meant unlimited everything for me). In America I pay $50 a month for my unlimited plan. Yes, the 4G is a little faster, but that may just be because I’m not trying to access the foreign web here…A third area (kinda related to the second) is how the CCP controls markets and prices so everyone can live a comfortable life. I ate a big plate of food at a small restaurant for between 10 and 20 rmb… ($1.25-2.50).

Without time, well, there would be no change, no way to experience a progression from past to future. So we need a time dimension for a causal universe in which “things happen”.Could we have more than one time dimension? Perhaps, but it is very difficult to conceive of a universe with two or more temporal dimensions that nonetheless remains causal (with the present uniquely determining the future). So two (or more) time dimensions, that’s probably out.Could there be fewer than three spatial dimensions? Sure, but “flatland” is very restrictive. For instance, you couldn’t have an internal digestive track in flatland: something with two openings would necessarily split your body into two disconnected parts. To allow such complexity, three dimensions appear to be the minimum required.Could there be more than three spatial dimensions? Now that might actually be too much of a good thing. In four spatial dimensions, for instance, tying a knot is no longer possible: the knot can always be unmade by sliding parts of it through the fourth dimension. That shows that, somewhat paradoxically, more dimensions can lead to reduced complexity (e.g., no tangled mass of wires behind your desktop computer in 4D-land.)So it seems that a 3+1 dimensional universe is almost an inevitability: Anything more or less would lead to a universe that is incompatible with the very idea of us being here and asking questions about its nature.Now of course that does not exclude the possibility that additional dimensions are present but suppressed, e.g., by compactification, which of course is how superstring theory tries to hide its embarrassing riches of excess dimensions.I thank my generous supporters on","5,990 followers",Jens Böttiger,566,2.6K,17.6M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Which-country-had-more-advanced-technology-in-the-late-19th-century-the-UK-or-the-US

In particular it hardly meets our everyday experience of live, and its understanding ot the world as being made of inanimate objects, moving and otherwise evolving around us.Such a representation of the world is reasonnably well accounted for by the Kantian view, that we live in a three dimensional space, which is changing with time. (you may call it Newtonian instead of Kantian if you will). There are lots and lots of theories in physics, which are based upon this latter conception. They form a whole domain of physics, which is labelled “classical”.However, if you limit yourself to this understanding of the world, you are sort of forced to accept as given data, a number of coincidences, which are absolutely mind blowing (colours of light - constitution of the matter explained with “only” some 100 atoms of elements - etc…). Considering the amount of “explanations” that we have of these other features, no one in his senses would accept them as pure coincidences nowadays.I trust that the above will be sufficient to lead you to rephrase your question.

Meaning she probably had control of the hammer entirely.Top this off with the fact that Mjolnir only existed to give Thor a way to control his power, and it wasn’t a far superior weapon as say Stormbreaker, and this probably leads to saying Hela had to have certain advantages to crush the hammer.Now, with that out of the way, we get to the other details.First off, Uru requires a forge powered by the heart of a star to melt and pour properly.As shown in Infinity War.During the process, the weapons are also imbued with magical properties and abilities.That isn’t any ordinary axe.Vibranium on the other hand, requires some sonic and heating abilities to forge. Heck, Cap’s shield was made back during WWII.Definitely not as advanced as using a star in stasis to forge weapons.Plus, as shown, we have far more examples of vibranium reaching its limits.Black Panther vs. Klaw2:10 in the video:Black Panther vs. Wakanadan army.(Geez, you think with how much of a cultural phenomenon this supposedly was, you could find better footage of the film.)Against both the heavy weapons of Wakanda and versus their war rhinos, his suit was overwhelmed and broke apart.Cap vs. ThanosThe most famous.The Mad Titan himself breaking Cap’s shield.Now let me start out that, out of ALL the PIS Cap has suffered through in film and comics, the way he decided to stop Thanos’ sword quite possibly was one of the dumbest of all time.You DON’T CATCH A SWORD ON THE EDGE OF A SHIELD YOU IDIOT!!!I’m sorry, I did love this scene and how symbolic it was, but the fact that in order to break his shield that Thanos had to his the edge of Cap’s shield was just really dumb.EDIT 7/8/2021: Thanos’ sword has been said to be made out of something other than Uru. Not told WHAT it is exactly, just that it is made of something else.Anyway, suffice it to say, it is believed that Thanos’ sword was actually forged of Uru as well. Plus, there is the fact the shield shattered at all, and Thanos’ sword was unscathed. Which considering now we know the sword was made out of something that is not Uru, we can firmly say Vibranium is nowhere near the strongest substance in the universe.But to wrap this up, in the MCU, vibranium is both proportionally weaker in comics, as well as weaker than Uru.Uru has shown itself to be far stronger, considering the only people who can forge it are servants to the gods, and it can be imbued with magics. Vibranium can be worked by humans with relative ease with modern tech, and even back in the 40s could be worked into shape.Uru is stronger than Vibranium based on shown feats. It is possible with magic imbuing and other advances that a piece of Vibranium could become as strong as Uru, but we have never seen it.Hope that helps, cheers!",3 followers,Michael Ahn,601,523,13.4M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Which-country-had-more-advanced-technology-in-the-late-19th-century-the-UK-or-the-US
