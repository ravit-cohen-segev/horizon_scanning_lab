Wouldn't that suck?Another interesting thought is that based on your question phrasing, the further out we can detect objects actually makes it worse, since the comet would be farther away it would be coming in faster, which means a longer missile flight time to change the trajectory, which means less time to change the comet trajectory.

The cost of storage was too high, especially after looser wartime restrictions were ended.There were of course surplus SMLE I, II and III Lee-Enfields after WW1, and they were used to standardise the various rifles of the Indian Army, Royal Navy and Commonwealth armies. But there can’t have been that many still in good order, by the late 30s, because the new-tooled No.4 Lee-Enfield was designed in 1934 and orders for several million placed in 1938.Deliveries were scheduled for 1941, as the general opinion was Germany wouldn't be ready to go to war before 1942.As far as machine guns go, the Vickers was a large, expensive bit of kit approaching 40 years old in 1938. The Lewis guns were shagged out and the Bren had not yet come into service. So there wasn’t much to abandon when the British Army made its first huge orders preparing for WW2.All that spare .303 ammunition and remaining small arms wouldn't have gone to waste, they would have found a home in reserve units. They had to go to the regular army instead an in 1940 we had to buy half a million M1917 Enfield rifles and BAR’s in .30–06 from unused American stocks to equip the Home Guard.Doesn't feel like there was a ton of WW1 surplus just lying around.I don't have the figures but the entire British stock of .303 before rearmament, but it can't have been anywhere near the annual production of ammunition they were contemplating for the next war. New ammunition types were also needed - the Mk.VIIz to extend the range of the Vickers guns and DeWilde tracer for RAF Brownings.In 1938 new production lines were set up, across the empire to ensure German bombing wouldn't destroy the British .303 factories: 768 million rounds were ordered from South Africa, 2.5 billion from Canada, more still from India and Australia - against a total of 7 billion rounds of .303 produced in the U.K during WW1, a lot of which got used.The British army had been in the mood for something different for a while. They had trialed the Pedersen .276 in Garand and Pedersen rifle form back in 1932. it was well liked and a big argument for the new smaller round was the saving of a ton of money in production (each one used just 2/3rds the resources of a big .303)The rimless design also allowed for superior capability through self-loading rifles and simpler machine guns.There was no money for new weapons in 1932 and by the time there was money for re-armament it was feared the war could begin before the new production tooling was ready. Thing is it wasn’t the lack of tooling that was the bottleneck, just like WW1 it was the lack of propellant and run down chemical industry. The British government had sold off its state propellant factories in the early 20s. Commercial production had been hit by the depressionThroughout WW2 British ammunition production was dependent on imports of propellant from the USA and India. If they had switched to .276 that demand could have been cut by 1/3rd.‘The sinews of war are endless finance’We stuck with .303 for several reasons, none of them good or even sensible. You could say they were judgement calls, but if so the mess we ended up with shows judgement was in short supply back thenBetween 1935 and 1937 the Army was seriously in love with its brand new Bren gun, they had expensively modified it to fire the rimmed .303 for standardisation with the Lee-Enfield and Vickers. Re-chambering it again might look silly, but so few Brens had been built by 1938 they wouldn't have been slowing down deliveries much. Indeed if they had made the call earlier and gone for Pedersen’s .276, the Bren could have been in manufacture much earlier as the original was already chambered for a rimless round.During re-armament Someone else decided all ammunition should be standardised to ease production. Some were concerned the .276 lacked the power for the support fire machine gun role, tank co-axial gun and aircraft armament, so .303 was retained as a compromise between those competing demands.Except it wasn’t good enough to cover all bases and the various services went out and muddled it all up again.The big water cooled Vickers took up far too much space in armoured vehicles, so for 1938 the Royal Armoured Corps chose the Czech TKvz.37 (BESA gun) as their standard Co-Ax and hull gun. Problem was it couldn't sustain its high rate of fire with the .303 rimmed case, the ejection sequence became unreliable and awkward. So the RAC stuck with its original German 7.92x57mm for the hull gunner and co-ax, while the tank commander got a .303 Bren. Thus creating a second ammunition production and logistics chain.Around the same time the RAF was expensively modifying the M1919 Browning to accept the rimmed .303 (in disintegrating link not cloth like the Vickers, so incompatible). It had been originally built for the rimless 30–06, and was a pretty good gun, in fact it would have made a perfectly good Co-Ax and hull gun for the RAC.In fact it was such a good tank gun the RAC kept the M1919 Brownings, in their original 30–06, on their lease-lend Stuarts, Grants and Sherman tanks. So now we had three separate logistics chains for the medium machine gun role.The RAC would eventually tire of this problem so they chose to standardise on one MG - the M1919 Browning in 30–06 not the BESA. They lasted on the Ferret scout cars until the early 80s.The Lee-Enfield SMLE MKIII was a legendary piece of kit, but the argument for keeping that weapon through rearmament was the existence of tooling and standardised ammunition. In 1936 this may have looked like an expeditious advantage, but by 1940 we had ruined that idea by insisting on a new tooled No.4 rifle and two separate MG ammunition chains, but by then were too far into the war to make big changes.Prior to rearmament the British Army knew of and liked the .276 Pedersen round and knew a .276 rimless Bren would have been simpler to adapt. Choosing the Garand or Pedersen rifle or even a No.4 Lee-Enfield in .276 could’ve cost less and arrived in service earlier as the expensive modifications to the Bren wold be unnecessary.If .276 was chosen for infantry company work it would have freed the RAF to keep the perfectly workable (slightly better) 30–06 in their Brownings. Which can become not only a replacement for the Vickers in the Royal Armoured Corps, but replace the Vickers gun in the infantry support fire role too.You get two ammo streams, but in practice they were handling three streams for small arms ammo by 1941 (.303, 7.92x57mm and 30–06).",46 followers,Ian Lang,1.1K,5.8K,64.3M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Is-technology-advancing-too-slowly

You’re only supposed to do one shot at a time. That magazine, I’m informed, does five rounds.

10,"There’s a little bit more to this issue than has been covered in other answers. The prevalence of high powered bolt action rifles in the early stages of WW2 - not limited to the British Army - was ultimately based on assumptions about the ranges at which engagements would take place. In Britain’s case, the .303 Lee Enfield had originally been adopted in response to experience during the Second Boer War (1899–1902), where engagements on the open ‘veld’ terrain were conducted at extreme ranges.

In Britain’s case, the .303 Lee Enfield had originally been adopted in response to experience during the Second Boer War (1899–1902), where engagements on the open ‘veld’ terrain were conducted at extreme ranges. This required rifles with powerful cartridges that could reach out to 800m or more with extreme accuracy; Boer farmers equipped with superior quality German rifles, and possessed of well honed shooting skills, held a frustrating advantage. Britain responded with improvements to the Lee Enfield, and a strong training focus (which we still have today!) on developing individual marksmanship skills. Indeed, based on the experience of the Boer War, immediately prior to the outbreak of WW1 the British Army was on the brink of adopting the Pattern 1913 Enfield Rifle, which was even more powerful with a very high velocity .276 round. That was prevented by the outbreak of hostilities, which was just as well - as it would have been a mistake - but the experience of WW1, fighting in the flat open expanses of Flanders, the Somme, and in the desert against the Turks, actually reinforced the value of the combination of a powerful bolt action rifle and the emphasis on long range marksmanship; at the start of the war, Lee-Enfield equipped British troops of the BEF decimated German formations in the flat, open fields of Flanders, and there was no significant fighting in built up areas or in woodland terrain because those environments were literally wiped off the map by the artillery. SMGs emerged right at the end of the war when the Germans developed the MP18 as a niche weapon for close quarters trench clearing, but British troops had an extremely effective mix of weapons with their Lee Enfields and the American designed Lewis gun. The other aspect of this is that the Lee Enfield was far superior to any other bolt action rifle in this sort of fighting. Compared to the long barrel K98 used by the Germans, the slightly less powerful .303 round, combined with double the magazine capacity (so far fewer reloads/pauses), better designed sights for snap shooting, and the smoothest bolt action of any service rifle (which uniquely allowed troops to stay in the aim when working the bolt) meant that the British soldier could achieve rates of fire with the Lee Enfield that are simply impossible with other bolt action rifles. The record was 36 hits at 300 yards in a minute, set in 1908 and never surpassed, but any competent soldier with this rifle can achieve 15–20 aimed shots per minute in combat, whilst with a K98 10 rounds was probably a good rate of fire. The Lee Enfield is the only bolt action that can come close to competing with self loading weapons like the M1 Garand for rate of fire, whilst out performing them in terms of range and accuracy. Between the two world wars the British Army was policing the Empire, but fighting in places like India’s NW frontier - just like the earlier S African conflicts - was the perfect environment for the bolt action Lee Enfield. The British Army has also had a consistent, irrational fear that the ammunition expenditure of troops would get out of control of you give them an automatic weapon (Again, this has persisted; Britain was slow to adopt an assault rifle after WW2, and then they did - the FN FAL - they had the fully automatic capability removed. With the current L85A2 rifle, the change lever to switch to full auto is deliberately difficult to use, and use is discouraged), which is another reason why they stuck with the Lee Enfield and developed it into the simplified No.4 variant. The Second World War was drastically different to all previous experiences though. Fighting at very close ranges (50–300m) in built up areas, terrain like Normandy’s bocage, or the jungles of Burma was suddenly the norm, and the bolt action Lee Enfield was suddenly far less handy than the powerful SMGs that had started to appear. It nevertheless retained the aforementioned advantages compared to other bolt action rifles, so in the midst of the war there wasn’t the sort of urgent desire to replace it, disrupting production and supply chains, that necessity would have imposed. Most German and Japanese soldiers had inferior bolt actions in their hands. The Germans had a bigger problem due to the profusion of powerful SMGs that their Soviet enemies possessed, and the far clearer superiority of the US M1 Garand in battle vs the K98k. This led the Germans to develop and issue the first assault rifles to their troops - albeit in small numbers - with shortened, less powerful cartridges to create a compromise between SMGs and full power bolt action rifles. Britain noted that this was the future, leading to postwar development and adoption of such weapons and the retirement of the Lee Enfield (except as a sniper rifle). The full story is therefore a classic case of an army being perfectly prepared for the last war(s) that it had fought - due to experiences that favoured the Lee Enfield, and the development of strong institutional bias - and then finding itself slightly ill equipped for the unanticipated nature of the fighting in WW2!One irony though - after holding out against adopting the 5.56 NATO round until the mid 80s (the Americans stopped the development of an indigenous short cartridge by imposing NATO 7.62 back in the 50s, but the British Army quietly savoured those…) - the most recent combat experience in Iraq and, more particularly, Afghanistan, has led to renewed interest in more powerful rifles! There are plenty of British veterans of that war who would, at times at least, have much preferred to have had a No.4 Lee Enfield in their hands than the L86A2, because they lacked the range and killing power to take out Taliban who were engaging them at long ranges. And the most ironic part of all? Amongst the profusion of AKs, a small but significant number of those Taliban fighters were using Empire vintage Lee Enfields!",93 followers,Kevin Oliver,508,13K,18.4M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Is-technology-advancing-too-slowly

Bear in mind that the British Army didn’t deploy a fully-automatic assault rifle until 1985, not least because it felt that the average soldier, equipped with a gun that fired quickly, would blaze through all his ammunition to no good effect and then — ungrateful little wretch! - ask them to buy him some more. In fact, marksmanship, not rate of fire, was the Holy Grail of the British infantryman, and the official view (to which there is, in fact, some merit) was that the Lee Enfield No. IV Mk. 1* could, at 25 aimed shots per minute, waste ammunition quite rapidly enough, thank you kindly.(There was also the whole weaselly 7.62mm NATO business that killed the select-fire EM-2 and the .280″ British intermediate round so that Col. Rene Studler could leave his mark on US ordnance history, but that’s another, later story and we shan’t go into it here.)In short, it was felt that semi-automatic rifles would place an unjustifiable burden in terms of logistics and production on the Armed Forces’ existing arsenals and British manufacturing capacity while offering insufficient benefits in terms of current operational doctrine to merit the expense and risk.",161 followers,Wilbert Kieboom,1.4K,131,751.9K,2019,https://www.quora.com/If-an-asteroid-the-size-of-the-Moon-is-going-to-hit-Earth-in-10-years-can-we-develop-technology-to-avoid-the-impact

Why did pretty much every military of WW2 use bolt action rifles instead of semiautomatic rifles, except the U.S. and their M1 Garand? There are a lot of interesting points, and why bolt action rifles were the predominant rifles in use.A funny thing happened before WW1. A lot of militaries and gun designers were interested in developing semiautomatic rifles. The first successful gas-operated semiautomatic rifle, the Mondragon M1908, was developed by General Manuel Mondragon for the Mexican Army, who not only issued it to regular troops, but actually used it in battle in 1911 during the Mexican Revolution. In the U.S., there were several attempts at developing semiautomatic rifles, from the Remington Model 8, designed by John Browning, of 1906, to Winchester Model 1903, designed by T. C. Johnson. In fact, several militaries knew that the rifles they were fielding were a little long in the tooth, and were looing to develop replacements for their bolt-action rifles. The French actually deployed the Fusil Automatique M1917 rifles towards the end of WW1, but found the rifles lacking; a later improved model, the M1918, showed its effectiveness during the Moroccan Rif War (1920–1926). The Germans, Soviets, and British began experimenting between the wars, but still kept bolt-action rifles as the main weapon of the infantry.What prevented the semiautomatic from making a major impact in WW1 and WW2? There are several good reasons. One, it takes time to develop, test, and refine a rifle design, even moreso for the military. Designing a firearm relies on many factors, right down to the ammo that you're going to use. The ammunition determines how beefy of a rifle and its mechanisms have to be. It also helps determine dwell time, ammo storage and reload, and recoil systems. The M1 Garand rifle was actually originally designed for a smaller cartridge (a special .276 caliber round), and later was changed to accommodate the demands of the Army Chief of Staff, Gen. Douglas MacArthur, in 1929.Two, what type of system do you use to make your rifle self-load? Again, the Garand shows us some of the thinking back then. The original Garand designed was a primer-actuated rifle, relying on the blowback from the primer and not the gas created from the burning of the propellant. There were several competing designs, and other new ideas for cycling ammunition in a firearm. Each competing system had its quirks, such as the Pederson rifle requiring waxed cartridges to cycle ammunition properly.Three, changing out a weapons system is expensive; changing out a weapons system with a new one that requires an entirely new cartridge is even more expensive. Between both world wars, the major European countries were economically weakened, relying on American credit to keep their economies afloat. With the American Great Depression, those lines of credit dried up, kick-starting a global depression that raged from 1929 until WW2. This actually froze a lot off weapons development, and forced nations to focus on specific systems to maximize dollars. After witnessing the Spanish Civil War, and the Nazi military performance during the war, most nations focused on modernizing armoured vehicles and aircraft. At first glance, one would assume a rifle would be simple, but think again. The cost of a new P-47, in 1945 dollars, was $83,000 ($1.16 million today) per aircraft, and a total of 15,636 were built (total cost: $1.3 billion in 1945, or $18.1 billion today); the cost of a new M18 Hellcat tank destroyer, in 1944, was $55,230 ($787,990.36 today), and a total of 2,507 were built, for a total cost of $138,461,610 ($2 billion today) ; the cost of a new M1 Garand was $85 in 1940 dollars ($1,524.58 in today's dollars, more than twice the cost of an M4A1 today, at $642 per), and we produced 5,468,772, for a total of $464,845,620 ($8.3 billionThe logistics of a rifle are nuts. It's not just about making the rifle, but sourcing the parts, keeping the rifle in the supply lines, making parts available for the armories, tools and consumables for maintaining them out in the field, and training soldiers not to kill them. And changing that logistics train is expensive. I think it's pretty telling that the only two major new rifle adoptions of WW2 were the American M1 Garand, which had been deployed because it was able to use current stocks of .30–06 ammunition, and could be comfortably produced in massive quantities while production facilities weren't under attack; and the French MAS 36, originally intended to be the backup rifle in case they couldn't get mass production of the MAS 40 semi-automatic rifle in adequate numbers for frontline use and also the main rifle chambered in the modernized replacement for the 8mm Lebel, which was woefully obsolete by the end of WW1.Everyone else had the same bolt-action rifles, with only minor changes (usually shortened barrels and minor improvements in the action), that they had been using since essentially the late 1890s, and using ammunition designed for use during WW1. The Germans essentially had the finest bolt-action ever deployed, with regards to reliability and accuracy, in the Mauser, and the British were an extremely close second with the Lee-Enfield rifle. The Russians, while developing the SVT-38 and SVT-40 semiautomatic rifles, couldn't really afford the production of new rifles for the frontline fighters, and had massive stockpiles of the Mosin-Nagant, a very reliable bolt-action with an extremely heavy, powerful round, and their doctrine was about to fundamentally shift in a way that relegated their service rifle secondary to submachine guns, since their combat was about to go urban in a big way; with the refinement of . The Japanese were quite happy with the Arisaka, since it had been successfully deployed and adapted since before the wars with Russia and China.Between being broke, having large stockpiles of excellent rifles and good ammunition, the logistics to support these older rifles were already in place, and no one wanting to test new equipment in the middle of a shooting war, I hope you can understand why most nations stuck with something that they already had.",0 followers,Ray Wilson,602,968,17.8M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Why-did-Britain-use-the-bolt-action-Lee-Enfield-as-their-primary-battle-rifle-when-repeating-technology-M1-Garand-Gewehr-41-etc-was-already-developed-and-working
