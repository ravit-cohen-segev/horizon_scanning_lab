2,"Liquids with metallic particle suspended have interesting properties. How exactly they will advance technology depends on so many things.What practical applications do they serve, and what do they replace? That will help answer the original question.as far as I know ferroflyids have only seen limited use on shocks in vehicles. Fluids never wear out like mechanical shocks. So they may replace older, mechanical spring style shocks","5,990 followers",Jens Böttiger,566,2.6K,17.6M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Why-hasnt-Apple-acquired-GT-Advanced-Technologies

4,"You don’t advance technology as a monolith. Germany is a leader in material science and mechanical engineering.Germany is sub-par in software engineering and in its physical communication infrastructure.

Germany is not the most technologically advanced country. It could be pretty close, but there are major elements of society who dedicate themselves to making sure that Germany uses inferior technology that kills more people, damages the environment more, costs more money, and will cause the total collapse of Earth’s biosphere due to a runaway greenhouse effect. Mostly in the Green Party. Because radiation from nuclear accidents is apparently scarier than way more people dying of regular pollution constantly and the total annihilation of all life on Earth as the oceans boil away.","5,360 followers",Valerio Cietto,677,2.4K,9.1M,2021,https://www.quora.com/How-will-ferrofluids-advance-technology
5,"TL;DRExplanationDisclaimer: I won't use formal language, so physicists are warned...Let's first assume that the peaks are not there. Then the configuration looks like:Cross section. The green thing is our physical structure, the black layer is the ferrofluid (TL;DRExplanationDisclaimer: I won't use formal language, so physicists are warned...Let's first assume that the peaks are not there. Then the configuration looks like:Cross section. The green thing is our physical structure, the black layer is the ferrofluid (please neglect gravity in this anwer).Now assume a tiny microfluctuation in the layer:Normal fluid: negative feedbackIf this was a normal fluid, say water, then the surface tension would create a negative feedback, bringing the surface towards the spherical (rest) state again. Why? Because the surface tension creates a force towards the center of the radius of the curvature:If the fluid was a non-ferrofluid (eg water), the surface tension opposes microfluctuations: we have negative feedback.Therefore the peak is pushed inwards again, while the valley is pushed outwards. The result of surface tension, is a water-air interface with minimal curvature.Ferrofluid: positive feedbackBut now for a ferrofluid. So you might know that a ferrofluid becomes magnetized itself, due to the applied magnetic field.Now mathematically, the difference between a microfluctuation and the rest situation (the spherical surface) can be described as follows:Mathematically, a lack of ferromagnetic material (the valley) is equivalent to a presence of a diamagnetic material (anti-magnetic material), marked with the blue, negative dot below:So now consider the red blob as extra ferromagnetic material, and consider the blue blob as extra diamagnetic material.Now with respect to the initial field, these extra blobs of material will also become magnetized:Everyone knows what happens, if you bring two magnets together, whose orientation is opposite. It's hard, and you feel that they tend to rotate such, that they will be positioned in a serial configurations, in which they both face the same way:Now in our microfluctuation, this causes the following forces:So the netto force on the peak, is a force outwards. This makes that the microfluctuation will be enhanced, instead of suppressed: there is a positive feedback loop, creating a constellation something like this:Again the blue dots mark an absence of ferrofluid, which is equivalent to a presence of diamagnetic fluid. The red dots marks the presence of extra ferrofluid (the visible peaks). Note that I haven't sketched the total field, but the sole effect of the peaks with respect to the begin situations. In reality the total field is pointed towards the left lower corner in this whole detail.Note that the interface has not that much curvature, the interface forms a cone, so it has only radial curvature. In the top of the cone (the visible peaks), the curvature is maximal, however, also the magnetic field is maximal there, creating a 'stiff' equilibrium.","246,850 followers",Dushka Zapata,1.5K,8.5K,232.4M,2016,https://www.quora.com/How-will-ferrofluids-advance-technology

There are hundreds of thousands of years of human existence prior to history, and there are hundreds of millions of years of Earth being a reasonably inhabitable planet prior to human existence. We do not know enough about those very long stretches of time to reasonably exclude the idea that someone built an advanced civilization on Earth and then eventually decided to leave and take most their identifiable artifacts with them. It’s not even that unlikely that humans would do the same if they ever got advanced enough to actually do it, one of the results of advancing technology is a growing preoccupation with leaving the natural environment of the Earth (and even other planets that are inhospitable wastelands) as pristine as possible.I would be inclined to place the odds against it having actually happened on Earth, especially with humans. The most plausible scenario would be a civilization of some other species fleeing the Earth in the face of some mass extinction event. They would have had to have been more advanced than modern humans to accomplish this, but given the distance in geological time and the conceptual difficulty of identifying non-human artifacts in the first place, it would be more likely to miss any evidence.Throw in extraterrestrial ancient supercivilizations, and it’s pretty much a certainty that some of them have had technology we can’t replicate today.","62,882 followers",Jay Bazzinotti,3.9K,22.2K,179.7M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Why-hasnt-Apple-acquired-GT-Advanced-Technologies
