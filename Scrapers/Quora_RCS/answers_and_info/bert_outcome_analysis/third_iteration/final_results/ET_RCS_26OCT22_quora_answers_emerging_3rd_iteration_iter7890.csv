The primary, when it detonates, first begins to radiate X-rays from its surface, with an energy on the order of 20 keV, corresponding to a temperature of about 200,000,000 K, into the Hohlraum, which is filled with some low-Z material, typically said to be some sort of plastic foam holding the other components of the bomb in place.The low-Z material is very quickly rendered into fully ionized plasma at about the temperature of the X-rays from the primary.The secondary, which contains the fusioIn a Teller-Ulam type device, a small primary nuclear explosive is placed inside a Hohlraum (cavity). The primary, when it detonates, first begins to radiate X-rays from its surface, with an energy on the order of 20 keV, corresponding to a temperature of about 200,000,000 K, into the Hohlraum, which is filled with some low-Z material, typically said to be some sort of plastic foam holding the other components of the bomb in place.The low-Z material is very quickly rendered into fully ionized plasma at about the temperature of the X-rays from the primary.The secondary, which contains the fusion fuel, is surrounded by a tamper of high-Z material, and the walls of the Hohlraum are composed of a large mass of some high-Z material. Suddenly the walls of the cavity and the tamper are in contact with fully ionized plasma at 200,000,000 degrees. X-rays of such energies are sufficient to partially ionize and impart significant momentum to atoms of the high-Z material, typically lead or uranium, easily tearing the ionized atoms away from the material. As a result atoms are rapidly ablated from all of the surfaces of high-Z material that are exposed to the plasma, causing rapid jets of material to enter the plasma.At the same time a tremendous amount of momentum is transferred in the opposite direction, causing huge pressure. This compresses the secondary enormously and also begins to cause the walls of the Hohlraum to expand outwards.The compression is very, very fast and it generates tremendous heat and pressure in the fusion fuel, which then satisfies the Lawson criterion, and begins to fuse rapidly, releasing copious fast neutrons as well as much more heat. These fast neutrons can be used to cause fission of uranium included as the high-Z tamper or in the core of the secondary. This greatly increases the energy yield.Eventually the Hohlraum expands too much, and the temperature and pressure both drop as it expands. So finally the fusion cuts off. Then, finally, the fireball reaches the outer skin of the bomb. Everything is vaporized, and the development of the fireball in the atmosphere continues in a very complex manner.The fission primary produces a very efficient compression of the fusion fuel which heats it and makes it denser. That is the basic mechanism that starts the fusion reaction. That’s why it is called a thermonuclear weapon.","220,637 followers",Franklin Veaux,823,47.3K,783.1M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Is-hydrogen-bomb-controlled-or-uncontrolled-fusion-reaction
1,"The simple answer is that there are two processes for releasing the energy of the nucleus of the atom, fission and fusion. Fission means tearing apart, and fusion means pressing together. The heaviest atoms, Uranium and Plutonium are split through fission to release energy, and the lightest atoms, specifically Hydrogen, are fused together to release energy. Therefore, the fusion weapon which uses Hydrogen for it’s fusible element, is called the hydrogen bomb.",UNKNOWN,Viktor T.

The majority of people today consider “uncontrolled nuclear fusion” as something that cannot be used for constructive purposes.It is widely perceivedIt is widely suggested that there are two types of fusion —Are there in reality two types of fusion?It is widely perceived that that there is a category of uncontrolled nuclear fusion where vast amount of energy are released in a manner that so far mankind has mostly used for causing destruction — the hydrogen bomb is an example. The majority of people today consider “uncontrolled nuclear fusion” as something that cannot be used for constructive purposes.It is widely perceived that in controlled nuclear fusion, the vast energy of fusion reactions is released steadily and smoothly so it can be used for peaceful purposes, say, in continuously burning Magnetic Confinement fusion reactors like the international ITER experiment and the planned follow on DEMO Magnetic Confinement demonstration power plant that is expected to one day produce commercial electricity.But is there really a difference (or is it just a difference in perception?)The reality is that the distinction between controlled and uncontrolled fusion is an artificial one devised by early fusion project managers at the Atomic Energy Commission during the mid-1950s during the height of the cold war in an effort to try to win over greater public support for their peaceful fusion reactor projects. AEC managers knew that the public deeply feared the newly invented H-bomb fusion weapons and that some market stratagem was needed to distinguish and separate in the public’s mind explosive H-bombs that they knew the public feared and the peaceful fusion reactors which they wanted to acquire the public’s funding support for. Early politically savvy AEC fusion program managers hit on the idea that we can propose the existence of two different types of fusion (controlled and uncontrolled) when in fact there is just fusion and depending on the specific fusion conditions and the amount of fusion fuel used, will produce a more or less rapid fusion burn and release of energy.Even in thermonuclear weapons, fusion actually produces a rapid thermonuclear burn of plasma versus a neutron driven exponentially increasing chain reaction as in the case of nuclear fission.While the density of the plasma and the smoothness and the time of release of energy from fusion may be different, the fusion reactions (Deuterium Tritium or Deuterium-Deuterium) are all the same and the waste products produced (helium and neutrons) are also all the same.Inertial Confinement Fusion produces fusion power in a series of discrete small controlled controlled bursts of fusion energy. Magnetic Confinement fusion devices like tokamaks attempt to produce smooth controlled thermonuclear burns of plasma, but in reality, no tokamak device has operated producing near to engineered power for more than about five seconds before the plasma containment is lost and the fusion device has to be shut down. Today’s Tokamaks including ITER typically employ a electrical transformer or solenoid to produce an intense plasma current that heats the plasma to fusion conditions. Use of such a transformer drive limits the operation of smooth burning tokamaks to periods of no more than a few hundred seconds or less - even in the very best case.So while the marketing spin is that Inertial Confinement Fusion experiments that produce fusion power in a series of short intense controlled bursts are BAD (explosive – nasty-dangerous), the reality is that ICF fusion can be just as safe and reliable as smooth burning MCF fusion experiments that in reality actually produce power in irregular pulses of unpredictable length of not more than a few hundred seconds in length (best case).","220,637 followers",Franklin Veaux,1.6K,47.3K,783.1M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Is-hydrogen-bomb-controlled-or-uncontrolled-fusion-reaction

When it does the rarely unsafe thing, it is significant, but that really doesn’t happen too frequently.The main problem is that it’s expensive, and nobody wants to pay more for it, or have their taxes go to subsidies that paper over the high cost.Some amount of nuclear is probably reasonable to mitigate global warming, but it’s expensive and slow to come online.

It doesn't make it safe, but it does allow that to happen at a sewage plant. If it just dumped it straight into my local river that could be a problem, but it doesn't, it manages it.

These have been promised forJeff Brown email I received:Economical clean energy is less than five years away…As regular readers know, I have been tracking the rise of nuclear fusion technology very closely. And one of my favorite companies in the space, Commonwealth Fusion Systems (CFS), just made a big-time announcement.CFS is building a 47-acre research and manufacturing facility just west of Boston. The facility will operate at the location of the old Army post Fort Devens, which is now an economic development zone. That means CFS is getting some tax incentives to build there. It’s a smart move.As a reminder, nuclear fusion is essentially the power of the Sun. It involves taking two separate nuclei and combining them to form a new nucleus. This produces an enormous amount of energy. And it is 100% clean.Unlike nuclearCFS is pursuing the classic tokamak design for its nuclear fusion reactors. We talked about this designThe key to CFS’s approach to its reactor has been through the development of new superconductors that enable advanced magnet technology. This is necessary to control the super-hot plasma in the reactor, causing hydrogen atoms to fuse and release energy.Commonwealth Fusion Systems’ Tokamak ReactorSource: Commonwealth Fusion SystemsCFS believes that this technology will enable compact fusion reactors small enough to fit inside a small room. Yet these reactors will produce enough energy to power 100,000 homes each.We’re talking about a decentralized, clean- energy power grid with zero carbon emissions. That’s the vision.So this is one of the most exciting projects in the nuclear fusion space.And it is very well funded. CFS has raised over $250 million to date, and it will have no problem getting additional funding in the private markets right now. Clean energy is such a hot space right now, and CFS has a clear road map to develop a nuclear fusion reactor.And get this – the new facility is being built right now. CFS expects to have a full-scale demonstration of its new magnet technology by summer. We are just months away.And the company is in a full sprint right now to go from demo to final product. To that end, CFS is doubling the size of its team from 150 to 300 employees. That will put the company on track to potentially have a fully functional nuclear fusion reactor by 2025.That means that the first demonstrations of utility-scale, economical clean energy are less than five years away. I can’t overstate how important this is.And this is why the venture capital and private equity communities are so excited. They won’t have to wait 20 years for a return. We are finally within a relatively short window from an investment perspective.Nuclear fusion is how we get away from burning fossil fuels without sacrificing our ability to provide for the power needs of everybody on the planet.Rather than poking around at the edges and making small contributions to baseload energy generation, nuclear fusion can literally provide for 100% of the world’s need for electricity","4,773 followers",Fergus Mason,6.5K,6.6K,28M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Is-nuclear-really-safe-and-clean-I-am-genuinely-curious

Though their understanding of nuclear power is very poor.There is some slow change in Washington with Generation 4 reactors getting more recognition. Currently, there may be no detailed planning that would be needed to get approval for a reactor. There is not support from industries and businesses to get to the proposal stage. Generation 4 prototypes need to be built as the next major step in the US.Applications for licensing is very expensive and complicated. Current licensing policies are based on current reactor technology and getting approval for a generation 4 reactor would be even more complicated.I think the Chinese will be able to continue without further US support. China has started the operation of Gen 4 gas-cooled reactor using pebble bed fuel. The pebbles are made from heat resistant carbon and silicon materials that are unlikely to melt. If cooling, power or pumps fail these reactors can remain safe by using natural airflow. The pebbles are routinely checked as they go through the system. When checked they can be easily returned to the reactor or be replaced if damage is suspected or a risk. The reactor does not need to be turned off for refueling. The pebbles are easily replaced or returned to the top of the reactor as other pebbles empty from the bottom. The longer the pebbles last the more fuel is burnt and less waste is produced. No metal fuel rods that could melt are needed. And no high pressure water is in the reactor. The fuel spheres, pebbles can tolerate more than twice the heat a fuel rod. Meltdown are highly unlikely.It is also likely that China is about to complete a Molten Salt Reactor/ MSR, that also has no fuel rods or water. The fuel is mixed with the salt coolant. The salt/fuel mix can be safely drained from the reactor at any time into safe cooling tanks. Overheating will automatically drain the salt before any meltdown. The salt has an unlimited lifespan so fuel can remain in the reactor until most of the fuel is burnt. Including the radioactive products produced from fission. Leaving minimal waste. Potentially salt reactors can run on nuclear waste from current PWR reactors. Without expensive separation of the toxic products. MSR reactors should use up far more waste than they produce. No need for expensive metal fuel rods or pebbles.China also holds the record for fusion reactors. Operating a research reactor producing plasma at twice the heat of the suns core for 100 seconds.China is also building a number of advanced water-cooled reactors from different countries.

Billions of dollars of funding have been made available over the decades since the mid-1950s for a variety of Magnetic Confinement Fusion experiments (tokamaks, stellarators, mirror machines, etc.). Sadly, there has been frustratingly little payoff for all this MCF pure fusion effort as never once in over six decades of effort has any MCF fusion experiment produced any net energy from fusion (even for micro-seconds).MCF fusion researchers and advocates promise (but do not actually deliver) smooth controlled release of MCF fusion power.ICF fusion worked and produced net energy from fusion from the very first experimental ICF fusion test (Ivy-Mike 1952).Practical Inertial Confinement Fusion produces power in a regular series of short controlled fusion bursts. This “pulse mode” of practical ICF power generation, and the military origins of the underlying technology, tends to scare the public and the public’s elected representatives in government who do not vote equivalent funding for practical ICF fusion, even though practical ICF fusion is the only form of fusion that has generated any net energy from fusion in over 60 long years of fusion experimentation.Inertial confinement fusion is the only form of fusion that has to date been proven to work in actual field experiments (not just in computer simulations). Cold war era Halite-Centurion series underground test shots (1977-1988) were fusion related add on shots piggy-backed onto DOE-DOD shots already on the underground test schedule. These shots were designed to utilize a small portion of the X-rays produced from the primary of an experimental device through a line of sight to ignite a remote fusion experiment housed remotely some distance away in the underground experimental test canister.Once classified Halite-Centurion pure fusion test shots experimentally proved that small DT filled spheres could be ignited and brought to full fusion ignition using an intense beam of X-rays. ICF fusion has beenIf the public was comfortable in producing fusion energy in a succession of short fusion “bursts” instead of in a smooth continuous fusion burn; providing funding and committing National Lab design resources in a way comparable to MCF research, we could have with very low technical risk reliable ICF fusion power plants in a time frame that matters (proof of principal within 5 years - commercial ICF power plants in 10 years).","220,638 followers",Franklin Veaux,3.2K,47.3K,783.1M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Is-hydrogen-bomb-controlled-or-uncontrolled-fusion-reaction

20,"Have humans ever created an energy-positive fusion reactor?Apart from bombs, which I’m assuming don’t count even though they are energy-positive?I believe a few reactors and experiments have very briefly produced more energy out than in, but none have done so in what you might call a “useful” fashion, where that energy could be exploited for power generation.",2 followers,Richard Muller,1.7K,2.3K,202.4M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Is-nuclear-really-safe-and-clean-I-am-genuinely-curious
