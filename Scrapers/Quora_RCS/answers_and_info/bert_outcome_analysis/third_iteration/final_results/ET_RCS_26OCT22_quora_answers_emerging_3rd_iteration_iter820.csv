They were:-Israel: Golda Meir-India: Indira Gandhi-Argentina: Isabel PeronSo we had a great democrat, a tyrant and a buffoon.Not much different than the men.",0 followers,Robert Arthurs,5.8K,57,1.1M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-would-be-the-next-technology-which-rule-the-world-in-automotive
1,"I've been waiting for this kind of question my entire….errr… Well, for a while! This is my moment. This is it! I finally get to useLet the Spider, Varys, do the talkin’“In a room sit three great men, a king, a priest, and a rich man with his gold. Between them stands a sellsword, a little man of common birth and no great mind. Each of the great ones bids him slay the other two. ‘Do it,’ says the king, ‘for I am your lawful ruler.’ ‘Do it,’ says the priest, ‘for I command you in the names of the gods.’ ‘Do it,’ says the rich man, ‘and all this goldI've been waiting for this kind of question my entire….errr… Well, for a while!

It really makes one think about power and an individual’s relationship with power. When I first saw/heard this quote my mind instantly raced to theThe way I see it, the answer is to Varys’ question is more subtle than predicting who lives and who dies.People in power only enjoy it at our (the people's) pleasure.The answer to your question is thatPower only resides where We think it resides.Edit:Update:",0 followers,Lucas Martin,6.4K,65,4.2M,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-would-be-the-next-technology-which-rule-the-world-in-automotive

3,"We don’t know. If I had to make a guess, I would say “VR” though.The concept of a immersive “cyberspace” has been around for a long time, starting with science fiction, but gradually we have gotten to the point it has become a practical option.Early immersive VR was incredibly crude; the headset was so heavy it had to be supported on a crane rig, and computer image generation was limited to low-polygon counts lest response times be so laggy people would be nauseated.however, that has changed; the more modern iterations of (say) the occulus are capable of realtime rendering with shading, from aWe don’t know.

The technology is ready for VR; the network capability (high speed internet, accessed via wifi, and always-on) is ready, and all that is really needed for “metaverse” is a framework and description language so that your local ISP can define the “world” but individual sites can define how their volume of space looks. We even HAVE such a language, and it has existed for a long time - VRML is the VR equivalent of HTML and can be coded by hand or output by many 3D design tools (there are other, more modern output formats however)Ignore “Web 3.0” though; that’s just an attempt to make money for no value (hence, is all about blockchain, naturally)","246,828 followers",Dushka Zapata,1.5K,8.5K,232.4M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-would-be-the-next-technology-which-rule-the-world-in-automotive

5,"Assuming that the person who creates this technology gives it away, and doesn’t sell it to the highest bidder, and the governments of the world don’t use “national security” as a reason to ban it, the world would come to a standstill.If you were faced with any decision - get a job, go on holiday, get married, place a bet - and you knew you could see the outcome, everyone would do it.Sports matches would be a thing of the past - why play football when you know if you will win or lose? And if you go to a match expecting to win, and play like that and you lose, does that mean you have changed theAssuming that the person who creates this technology gives it away, and doesn’t sell it to the highest bidder, and the governments of the world don’t use “national security” as a reason to ban it, the world would come to a standstill.If you were faced with any decision - get a job, go on holiday, get married, place a bet - and you knew you could see the outcome, everyone would do it.Sports matches would be a thing of the past - why play football when you know if you will win or lose? And if you go to a match expecting to win, and play like that and you lose, does that mean you have changed the future and will cause a paradox? Or can fate be changed?What about bigger things?If you know the result of a general election, do you declare a winner a week in advance? And so do you bother holding the election? But if you don’t hold the election is there really a winner?And if you have declared the winner, but several thousand people don’t bother to vote because their party won, would that cause a world ending event of universe destroying proportions?Or would the government force everyone to vote and vote the way they know they voted to ensure the world isn’t ripped apart?Even something as obvious as crime detection would be a nightmare.If Mr Smith sees himself being murdered, and knows who did it, can he actually have Mr Jones arrested for something Mr Jones hasn’t done? Or does he have to wait until Mr Jones murders him? Or attempts to murder him?I am pretty sure the governments would have to ban the device and destroy the technology within a few weeks, otherwise chaos would ensue.",18 followers,Asim Qureshi,17K,996,156M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-would-be-the-next-technology-which-rule-the-world-in-automotive
