I am not actually super well-informed about his life and biography, but I'll indicate roughly the way to think about this question in a way that reflects the real personality of the real Einstein, not Einstein as poster physicist or Einstein as Symbol of the State of Physics.Let's take a serious shot at profiling.He was extremely creative and had startlingly unusual perspectives on things. His talent lay in coming at things from completely weird angles. Angles that others would never have thought of.These traits do NOT map to becoming a finance quant. Or an ad targeting. Those would actually require vastly more energy AND complicated technical proficiency AND a singular lack of aesthetic sensibilities AND a sort of worldly interest in money/visible success that I doubt he had.The profile does not fit.The traits also do not map to some usual suspects list of questions. The problems outlined by Richard Tabassi represent aAn ""end of physics"" state where we can no longer answer the questions we can pose. John Horgan has argued this point of view nicely in his book The End of Science. If so, we're in an angels-on-pinhead state of ""ironic science.""Assuming optimistically that we're in the second kind of state, an Einstein type personality will actually not be able to contribute anything until the current paradigm is ""broken"" by something like the M-M experiment, creating a radically unexpected situation/paradox that requires someone of his talents to put humpty-dumpty together again.This situation favors heavy-lift theoretical systemizers (Edward Witten, J. C. Maxwell, Poincare) with formidable synthetic powers but not necessarily a talent for surprising shifts in perspective or paradox-resolution.I mean think about it: an idea like ""maybe the speed of light is constant for all observers"" is just so completelyThis is the sort of guy who comes in after everything has been devastated by a paradigm failure, and comes up with a new way to put the pieces together. Things aren't exactly working well now, but they aren't shattered.So physics is not actually in a favorable state for an Einstein type personality to do big things. Maybe in 20-30 years if an unexpected experimental result emerges from CERN or somewhere that topples the current models.So is there some other field of human endeavor that would reward an Einstein?I think one possibility is nailing the connection between computing and physics.Another might be making a genuine advance in computational complexity. Possibly casting P != NP in a surprising new light that breaks the impasse of understanding/insight there.A third might be coming up with a true theory of complex networks (scale free graphs and all that sort of thing). Right now, that stuff is a sort of Keplerian-empiricist state.But basically, it is completely unpredictable. What is interesting about the Einsteins of history is that they force very sharp turns in our thinking that we cannot predict before the fact. That's why they're called ""paradigm shifts.""By definition an Einstein is someone who asks the right question rather than answering questions assumed to be the right one.If I could REALLY predict what question an Einstein would work on, I'd be that Einstein.",6 followers,Mats Andersson,18.9K,20K,370.3M,2013,https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-intuitively-understand-Kernel-in-kernel-ridge-regression-Gaussian-kernel-regression-and-SVM-kernels-Are-they-all-the-same

A disabling problem will only impose restrictions and negativity.Breaking The PatternHumans are creatures of habit. The human mind is loath to do anything that takes it out of its comfort zone. Hence, people feel reluctant exercising, learning a new language or any such thing. Thorpe writes that Einstein was most successful when he was willing to consider anything, particularly ridiculous ideas. Breaking patterns tears you out of your rut by generating novel ideas that people are usually too practical to consider. Constantly pushing oneself to doing and trying new things every day is how patterns are broken and greatness achieved. As the quote goes, “Get comfortable with being uncomfortable. It will take you places.”Breaking The RulesBreaking rules is not a sign of rebellion which you must adopt to distinguish yourself from the majority. Rather, Thorpe comments, it is a focused, deliberate and systematic way of finding solutions. When you have exhausted all acceptable alternatives in your quest for the perfect answer to your problem, the only option is to break the rules and see what solutions it yields. Moreover, the kind of thinking that pathological training and compulsion to obey rules produces is not one that changed the world. Of course, obey the traffic rules and respect each other’s privacy. But in everyday life it is essential to break away from enforced norms and regulations to realize your true vision.Grow The SolutionEinstein’s labour of love, the theory of relativity, was eight years in the can before it could be released to the world. Chances are, you already know how you are going to make your mark in the world. The prospect seem impossible, or difficult at the very least, because the idea is raw and obscure. It has to be protected, nurtured and nourished it in your own special ways so it can take root and flower. It requires effort, preparation and perseverance. The mass media would have us believe that all innovators are solution superstars who woke up with the perfect idea one fine morning.

After that, there would be a lot of squabbling between scientists (I wrote this before the actual squabbling began — see comments, questioning my decisions of including Galileo and, to include one non-physicist, Charles Darwin. This commentary below argued for replacing Darwin with Maxwell which was reasonable, but made my point—only Newton and Einstein rule incontrovertibly).The point is that Einstein is one of the two greatest giants of science of all time. Not just of the last century. Not just in physics. And for the people who know this best, the only question is whether Einstein should be to the left or right of Newton.There is a lot of silly stuff on Quora asking if Einstein’s IQ is the highest, and even sillier questions about Tesla and Einstein. All of that is noise. And by people who just don’t get it. Einstein’s IQ, and his knowledge, and his intellectual stamina, and his dogged personality and perhaps most of all, his imagination, it all added up to something very deep and grand and earthshaking. Newton taught us that movement and forces could be all mathematically understood whether it was an apple falling from a tree or planets orbiting the sun. It was a big deal.Einstein told us that we needed to view space and time completely differently. That there was an equivalence between falling freely and being without gravity. An equivalence between gravity and acceleration. And that all this is really about distortions in space-time. Gravity, matter, energy, and momentum are the curvatures in space-time. How bizarre! and against all conventional wisdom. His theories of special relativity, and even more so, of general relativity, describes a reality that we, puny humans living in a sheltered world of medium sized objects moving very slowly, could never have evolved to understand. I want to emphasize that. Almost four billion years of biological evolution on earth have refined the human mind to adapt to, to see and interact with a certain type of world. Einstein breached that mindset. He thought of and understood things we could not possibly have evolved to be able to see, to do. In that sense (and not the silliness about IQ) Einstein was “super-human”. And the consequences of his deep understanding of our universe are greater than anything man has done before. I don’t think it’s possible to overrate him.","56,133 followers",Jean-Marie Valheur,7.8K,3.4K,310.4M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-might-young-Einstein-ponder-today

But when he dallied it was because he had a chance to discuss things of interest that had previously escaped his notice and thought. And this, despite my mother's efforts, was not talking about physics. Her field was what today we would call molecular biology but he resisted her efforts to have him explain physics to her.But occasionally, Einstein would pick up on a discussion that the animated younger women were having for which Einstein had questions. Politely, and with a cool intellectual demeanor, he would ask my mother questions. And he would bore in to a deeper point. One example she related was on her plans on hosting a Jewish religious meal (Seder). My mother was from Italy and hence Sephardic Jewish. Einstein, though German and hence Ashkenazi Jewish, had lived for a time in Italy and knew some of the differences in customs. Though not interested in the religious parts, he queried her understanding of these different customs and their meaning. Like an anthropologist, he tried to calculate where and when the Jewish traditions had diverged.Einstein was, according to my mother, genuine and gentle but persistent and occasionally impatient. He was inquisitive. He didn't make small talk. He tried to understand things, and only spoke to ask a question or clarification. He never patronized or disrespected these two young women. And, according to my mom, when asked on the IRS tax forms for his occupation, Einstein wrote in ""student"".

At other times, he would be highly supportive, feeling ‘moved and honored’ when offered the Israeli premiership… but declining it because he felt incapable of ruling a country. He could speak against religion, yet also defend his notion of God passionately. Some of his more socialist-leaning views, surely, would raise eyebrows today.Albert Einstein was not a “man for all seasons”.

Hans Albert was a pretty brilliant scientist. He was a professor of hydraulic engineering at UC Berkeley and the world's foremost expert on sediment transport. That might not sound as impressive as his father's achievements, but that still makes him a pretty smart person.Hans Albert's children, again, had many of the health problems that characterized the first generation of Einstein descendants. You see, Hans Albert had four biological children, but only one of them, Bernhard Einstein, survived to adulthood.Bernhard EinsteinBernhard was a pretty smart guy. He became a physicist, worked in engineering for Texas Instruments and Litton Industries, and received half a dozen US patents in his life. That's pretty decent, but that's not quite as great an achievement as his grandfather's.Bernhard had five children, but I was unable to find information on any of them.

If you were half the world away (10,000 km) you would not see the fireball since it would be below the horizon, but 33 minutes after the impact an earthquake of magnitude 11.2 would arrive. 8 hours after this the air blast would arrive as a loud (88 dB) noise and a 200 kph wind, knocking over some trees and earthquake weakened buildings. In another 8 hours after this, coastal regions will be met with a 75 m tsunami, which will basically wipe them clean of any surface structures.Many people will survive this initial impact that were on the hemisphere opposite to it, but their bad times are just beginning. Remember that 166,000 cubic kilometers of rock that was vaporised at impact? Well that dust is now sent high up into the atmosphere where the jet streams act to diffuse it all around the globe. The amount of available sunlight falls significantly and plants cannot get enough energy to grow. It takes years for the worst of this dust to fall out of the stratosphere, but residual effects will most likely persist for decades, making for greatly reduced crop yields.Humanity will not be made extinct, but only a tiny fraction of it will survive, and recovery will be a slow, painful process. Perhaps in a few hundred years we could start to reestablish civilization of some sort and gradually make inroads into the “blasted zone”.Such an impact is calculated to occur once every 4.1 billion years, and gets more unlikely with time (everything big has either already impacted or is in a stable orbit).Now let’s look at the exact same object, but now coming from the Oort cloud, which a lot more likely since although we have a pretty good idea of what’s in the asteroid belt and what the orbits there are, the Oort cloud still remains mostly a mystery with very little data concerning it available.If something were to “fall in” from there, it won’t be dawdling along at at mere 17 km/s, it’ll be hustling along at 51 km/s thanks to our friend orbital mechanics. If we reset the Impact Earth program to suit, the energy delivery now becomes 61 billion megatons of TNT, or 9 times the first value. That makes a difference.We now have a crater 348 km wide by 123 km deep being made, and 1,490,000 cubic kilometers of bedrock vaporized at the impact site. as far as our hypothetical observers halfway around the world go, the earthquake felt would be indistinguishable from the first scenario, but the airblast would be significantly more powerful with a velocity of 612 kph. If anything survived that blast, then the 130 m tsunami arriving 8 hours after that will certainly cure that.If the unfortunate observers were on the opposite side of the planet, then they would encounter similar conditions to what the first case scenario would see with a 17 km/s hit. There would be some that survived, but they would be the unlucky ones since they will now have an Earth that has all infrastructure comprehensively destroyed, and facing a super severe winter that will last for years. Whoever is left will be dead from starvation before the skies could have a chance to clear. The few surviving plants that managed to hibernate through the years of extreme cold can get reestablished and start growing again, but most of the animal life will be now extinct.This is now Earth V2.0, and in a few million years there will be a whole new range of life on planet Earth, but it won’t include us, or anything we could recognize.","105,674 followers",Dave Consiglio,894,6.8K,91.6M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-might-young-Einstein-ponder-today

Formidable to many. Not why I’m picking him. Those are bonuses. It’s all about the Spider sense.This gives him a slight advance notice of any danger coming.

Although he can’t always dodge the attacks coming, imagine if those few seconds were perceived by the atto second perception of: #2 The FlashNothing, but nothing could get the jump on you. Ever. The Flash’s feats are flat out ridiculous. Many other posts go into why. These two alone are incredible, but since we can keep going… let’s next pull in: #3 Plastic ManGo try that stuff with the Bat, Bane. Nothing for you here.This guy is damn near indestructible. He doesn’t seem to age, but evolve. He spent 3000 years at the bottom of the ocean as shards and when he was able to pull himself back together, was physically fine (mentally he needed a bit of help, but well, whatcha gonna do?). Telepathic attack? Immune. Physical attack? Not likely. Healing factor? Got one, but barely need it. He is fully functional at the bottom of the ocean as well as on the moon. Plus, this guy can shape shift into just about anything. Mystique is limited to a certain percentage of her mass. Plastic man, not so much. He can shift his mass in either direction (from the size of a building to thin as a sheet of paper to liquid), is capable of generating moving parts within his own body, even adding superhuman strength if he desires. Some of his forms include a fully functioning tank, Batman and a can of bug spray, and I’m barely scratching the surface. So convincing are his transformations he was able to get away with this:Not saying I would do this (though if I had a willing gf we would be the talk of every comicon/social event/formal event/…) but making your body feel like a silky dress is amazing molecular control.Now, with just these three, you can go anywhere, be anyone and no one can get the drop on you, and even if they do, there isn’t much they can do to you. Now for the fun of it, let’s bring some more power in here with: #4 Forge! Wait, Forge? HELL YES FORGE!His power is dual in scale. His mutant power is one of invention and mechanical understanding. He is literally able to invent whatever he needs for a given situation and understand any tech he sees including alien tech. Now give him the added genius of Spider-Man and the speed of thought of the Flash.Is there a crazy powered individual giving the world a hard time with his huge space gun or whatever? By the time the space gun has the trigger half pulled, you’ve already identified what it is, come up with a way to stop it, ran all over the world to get the parts you need, built it, stopped the bad guy, had an ice cream cone and built your parents a new house just for the fun of it, because you should always take care of your family. Now, one other fun thing about Forge is he is a powerful Shaman. Just so we could have magic in this mix of top 5 brand awesomeness.So now, maybe there is some Batman level guy that might be all ‘I could take him with prep’ or a Superman level guy that’s all ‘I could beat him with my sun dips n cold breath or whatevers’. Well, maybe you could somehow. But could you take:All of me? Yep, #5 (6,7, 8,9,10…) is Jamie Madrox - The Multiple Man. Everything I have, times a 1000 plus. I could do everything everywhere all the time. No more excuse to not learn how to play the cello.Seriously, I’ve always loved the cello.If I assign one of my guys - just one - to generate power on a big treadmill or other device? The world has unlimited energy. Assign one of my guys - just one - to cure diseases? The world is cured. You get the idea. Crime? Non-existent if I decide to go on patrol. Impoverished countries need help farming? Planted all your fields before I finished the sentence. Next up, let’s explore space.

He also possesses enhanced strength, stamina, durability, agility and reflexes.#5. LongshotHis power is literally good luck. He is capable of altering probability in order to make things go his way, even if the probability is only 0.1%. He is superhumanly acrobatic (speed, agility, dexterity, flexibility, reflexes/reactions, coordination, and balance), to the point of being able to hold his own against Spider-Man in combat. He also possesses superhuman attractiveness, which makes women fall in love with him at first sight.With all of these powers in mind:I could use the Flash’s powers to build various things at superhuman speeds (with Tony/Forge’s intelligence and technical prowess), use Karnak’s ability to see the flaws in my designs and make them stronger, and Longshot’s ability to make sure everything always worked out in my favor. And there are BILLIONS of other ways these powers can be combined and used.","6,018 followers",Johan Torres,1.5K,1.8K,24.1M,2016,https://www.quora.com/What-might-young-Einstein-ponder-today

I love the Ghost Rider not only because he's amazing but as well as the fact that he's taken down some heavy hitters.A few of these people include: Doctor Strange, Satana, The Swampthing (I think), Thor, and many more. Some may point to his defeat by Punisher as an exception but this was primarily due to bad writing and secondarily due to plot stupidity.So, from Ghost Rider, I am going to take the source of his powers directly: The Spirit of Vengeance.It has occured to me that I may not be able to control this spirit but I've thought of a solution…Charles Xavier:One of the most, if notI'd use this ability to sort of program my mind to block any and all actions that are not mine (i.e. should the SOV attempt to control me without my permission, this 'algorithm' would block it and give me time to mount a defense against it.)Oh, and that defense? Well…Darwin:He's the unsightly, pale fellow there in the bottom right panel.Regardless of how odd he may look, Darwin is quite the capable young…man…thing.His ability, for those who don't know, is advanced adaptibility. This means that, for example, should he be met with a situation in which he surely wouldn't be able to survive in, like a super P.O.’ed hulk, he'd simply teleport away.Or, if he should find himself in the harsh vacuum of space, his body would get denser and he wouldn't need to breathe to survive anymore.However, this ability isn't limited to his body only. No, it can also affect Darwin's mind. For instance, if you wouldn't mind scrolling back to the image I started this particular character exhibition with, he read some of an alien language as well as had heard it spoken and thus he now can speak and read this alien language.Now, should our little friend The Spirit of Vengeance feel the need to take control of me because it doesn't particularly agree with what I deem necessary, then I'd use this ability (an ability I'd have total control over thanks to Legions ability to basically customize these powers) to find the simplest solution that doesn't involve exorcising the SOV from my body.If I'm being honest, I misread the question. I read that there were to be four super powers instead of five. Tsk, my bad.Guess I'll go with the default…Mobius Chair:The Mobias Chair! Oh goody! I love this one as much as I do our old buddy Spirit Of Vengeance.This chair does the following:Essentially, you are a god whilest on this chair. And yes I know, it has a high physical strain. However, I'm sure the combined powers of Legion, Darwin, and The Spirit of Vengeance are enough to keep me goingOr:Oblivion:Oblivion, nigh omnipotent, and seriously sinister in appearance.

Foil has the ability to imbue non-living objects with the ability to ignore select laws of physics. Most notably, the ability to punch through anything. And I mean anything. Theres a parahuman in worm who can freeze things in time by touching them. When frozen, they cannot be hurt. Flechettes ability allows her to hurt them. Her power would easily cut through Supermans skin. She can one shot the majority of things on earth, and probably kill Galactucus, or at least injure him a shit ton. She also has a minor ability for timing and suchlike, but when combined with the power at the bottom this isn’t needed.Second - AlexandriaSuperman, but not Superman. Her ability, roughly, puts her body in a stasis, where her skin is invunerably, inside and out. Her skin is cannot be broken by any known thing bar the entitys and possibly Foil. While she can be drowned, she also has Superstrenght. While not level with Superman, she can lift about 1.75 million tons. She can fly super fast, at least faster than the eye can follow. She also has vastly improved mental functions, being able to learn super fast and never forget what she learnt. She can be hurt however, and takes longer than most to heal. She is functionally immortal from old age.Third - ArmsmasterPretty basic ability. Has the ability to make any device super efficient and miniature. Uses this to make weapons and armor that’s packed with far more features than should be physically possible. In other words, if he ever go his hands on Iron Man tech, the world as we know it is doomed.Fourth - RegentRegent has the ability to make targeted involuntary movement of any target. This can range from making a leg twitch so they fall over, to controlling internal organs and making them spew. While not amazing in battle unless he caused, say, the flash, to go flying, this is simply a side affect of his main power, which means that close range prolonged exposure, any where between 15 minutes to several hours, he can completely control their actions, and their power. While this ability only has a certain range, and his control gets worse the further away that person is, any time the target re-enters his range he gains instant control over them. He can also control more than one person at once, however his control gets worse, and if he gets distracted he can stop controlling someone momentarily, and that can be quite a bad thing.Last - ContessaProbably one of the best powers on this entire question page. Contessa is from the web-serial worm (great read btw), and has what is called the Path to Victory shard. In other words, any problem she has, she will beat. Why? Because her power is quite literally, a way to see the outcome of any conflict that will lead to her winning. Superman comes? Every attack he makes will be dodged no matter what, and eventually she’ll kill him with kryptonite she had to go to the batcave to get. When combined with the above powers, I am unstoppable. There are very few people that can stop me, only Scion, Edilion, and the Endbringers. My abilities as Contessa would allow me to steal Iron mans stuff so I could run around with super Iron man stuff. I can fly superfast, I could easily beat literally every person in the Marvel/DC universe, assuming they can’t insta kill me from anywhere.",2 followers,John Nofsinger,1.6K,3.1K,14.9M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-might-young-Einstein-ponder-today
