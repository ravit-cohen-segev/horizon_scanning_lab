0,"Absolutely.But there's a huge mistake made by most science fiction books and TV shows.

And that mistake is that they just follow with biotechnology, instead of our normal machine technology from the beginning.That is just nearly impossible to happen.Only through our technology made of machines did we learned about the DNA, and how to map DNA.Now we're working with RNA and mRNA. Most of the vaccines developed to fight COVID-19, were only accomplished through use of the knowledge acquired by understanding RNA.So a civilization whatever that might be as to possess an era of mechanical technology, before being able to branch off completely into biotechnology.Where for example, they can not only decode DNA but decipher it altogether, thus getting the literal blueprint of Life.Once you understand what all genes can do then you start to develop completely original organisms, that will work as technology. Biotechnology.Instead of building something they'll grow something. Buildings, vehicles, generators/reactors, medicine and medical treatments.Such a thing would demand that any species, even our own, had a complete understanding of DNA and DNA coding. Meaning we could design biotechnology at first with machines, but then after the first pieces of biotechnology are created, we would use those instead of mechanical machines.Biological machines and materials that could never have evolved that way naturally.Even our bodies would eventually become part of that same technology. Because, why suffer from ailments when you could just reprogram your entire DNA, and become something far better.You could literally switch off the aging process of your body, and even turn back the biological clock to those already past their prime.Now. What seems extremely unlikely is that any species can just make the jump to biotechnology, without first going through the same technology we're going through.Like for example the Wraith in the Stargate Atlantis TV show.The Wraith apparently just evolved to be capable of creating organisms, that in turn have specific functions much like any piece of technology.And that is extremely unlikely. Not impossible mind you… Just very hard to achieve without something else going on.A lifeform like the Wraith would need to possess some form of telepathy, that allowed them to sense, understand, and ultimately control DNA with their minds.It would be like focused and forced evolution of simple cell organisms, to become something more. Something they would've never become through natural means.But biotechnology itself is not some science fiction dream that can't happen, if anything it will happen once our understanding of DNA reaches a mastered status.Once DNA and also RNA holds no more secrets to us.We would be able to create technology that had its own artificially created DNA, that was created to consume certain materials be them organic and non-organic, in order to create biotechnology.Technology that was biological at its core.It may happen or may never happen, and instead humanity will keep on building more and more advanced machines. Not only advanced but also smaller in size.I'm talking of course about mastering nanotechnology. And nanotechnology seems the more natural way to go.Where in time we'll created technology that can manipulate matter on many levels. Even the biological matter in our bodies.Why cut people open when you can have a swarm of microscopic machines flow through your bloodstream, spread throughout your body and fix anything wrong with a level of precision we can only dream of today.We would be able to cure all diseases. We would be able to make the blind see, and those that can't walk walk again. We would be able to even regrow entire limbs, that had been lost.And of course over time people might even let go of biology entirely, and choose to go full on technological. Placing their minds inside highly advanced technological artificial bodies.Both paths will be open eventually.Which one our species will choose is anyone's guess.",183 followers,Dean Gibson,19.1K,336,402.6K,2021,https://www.quora.com/Is-the-science-fiction-trope-of-an-advanced-technology-based-on-living-creatures-rather-than-machinery-plausible

Corn ethanol was envisioned as a substitute for fossil fuels, trying to change our dependence on fossil fuels. Shellac increased the longevity and beauty of wood furniture, and was the forerunner of polymer plastics. Cocona is processed coconut fibre that can be made more cheaply than cotton, and is twice as strong and durable. Casein Glue was a light and strong glue based on cow's milk and other forms of calcium, and it is water soluble and completely non-toxic.Leonardo da Vinci is widely regarded as the forefather of Aeronautics. His early ideas were all inspired by bird flight. Same with Optics, we would not have the understanding we do about how light behaves without studying our own eyes. When Watson and Crick mapped the human genome, research was launched later about how to re-write DNA, and they looked at the simple power of the common virus to learn how to do that. RFID tags, nanoscale structures that carry a certain magnetitc charge were said to be inspired by bees, who can see the pollen of flowers because the pollen sparkles at a certain ultraviolet frequency, which revolutionized the world of security and logistics.So you see, plenty of advanced technology to be had.

Don’t deal well with temperatures below freezing either (they need a liquid solvent), but that is a much easier problem to solve. The biggest advantage of biological machines is that they can self-repair and (if designed to do so) reproduce themselves. At molecular level the world is abundantly stocked with spare parts. This can be important if the machine must operate far from any source of supplies.So I suspect the single biggest area for biological machines will be space. I wish I could claim it is my original idea, but it is not — the first person to come up with it was Freeman Dyson:""Small, lightweight, and intelligent, Astrochicken is a versatile space probe that has a clear advantage over the bulky, exorbitantly expensive space missions of the past, which have been a bottleneck to space exploration. ... It will not need huge quantities of rocket fuel; it will be bred and programmed to 'eat' ice and hydrocarbons found in the rings surrounding the outer planets""Anything that can build more of itself out of ice and hydrocarbons, is pretty much by definition biological.",UNKNOWN,C.S.

3,"It’s not plausible that a culture developed technology based on living creatures without developing technology based on machinery to some degree first.There are two ways to develop technology based on biology - adaptive breeding and genetic engineering.

But finding a tube that can handle enough pressure to get a decent range is going to be difficult.Genetic engineering makes it much easier to achieve what you want. It’s difficult to conceive of a species getting enough knowledge to perform this without having some mechanical technology. You need to figure out what DNA (or the alien equivalent) is, and how to detect and manipulate it. While cells and viruses can manipulate DNA, figuring out how to do this effectively by natural means seems unlikely.

Lord knows the Soyuz and Progress rockets were both designed in the 1960’s, based on modified R7 rockets initial built from the captured V2 rockets built by the Third Reich in the mid-40’s.To this day, the Soyuz is still launchedThat’s not what I’d call “space-age technology.”The U.S. government, with the end of the shuttle, pushed for the reuse of all the parts used to make the shuttle for the new replacement Constellation program. A program that even the most optimistic estimates put at launching in the 2020’s at a cost of over $40So, Constellation was canceled, except for the Orion capsule. And then they pushed the SLS instead, still re-using the parts of the 1960’s designed Space Shuttle (along with updates from the 90’s and early 2000’s).SLS has now burned through at least $12So, China started developing space flight, and they’ve successfully put astronauts and even two space stations into orbit. But calling them advanced would ignore the fact that they have, almost bolt for bolt, copied the Russian Soyuz capsule and the Progress rocket with its horribly poisonous UDMH and N2O4 hypergolic fuel. Even Russia is retiring that sad old dinosaur.In fact, a lot of the current batch of decades-old rockets are being retired.Why?Because of two corporations. One of them is very public, and one is very secretive, but both of them have taken the Aerospace industry and shaken it to its absolute core.The public one is SpaceX, the private one is Blue Origin. Both of them went out and did what everyone said was impossible. They built new engines from scratch with new technology, put them into new rockets built from scratch with new technology, and launched them.But, more importantly, they landed them.You see, other than one part of one rocket, the shuttle orbiter, no other rocket has ever landed before. (Yes, they re-used the boosters too, but the price of refurbishing them after a dip in the ocean was arguably higher than just building them over every time, and they had to be shipped back to Utah to be refurbished anyway. If you have to take something apart down to parts, swap out half the parts, and then rebuild it — is itSo, this has scared the entire launch industry, worldwide, out of their socks.SpaceX is talking about reusing a Block 5 booster within 24 hours. They’re working on BFR, which they claim can be reused as quickly as you can refuel it.Blue Origins’ New Shepard is a bit of a hobby rocket for sightseers, but it proved out BO’s ability to land a rocket and reuse it. New Glenn is a super-heavy lifter that has yet to fly, but will have the same reusability as a SpaceX Falcon 9.And they’re not stopping there. SpaceX is already on the brink of recovering cargo fairings, which would save them $6M per flight, and they’re about to test second stage recovery, which would mean the entire consumables from a flight would basically reduce to the fuel, and a few plastic covers, a compression ring on the second stage engine bell, and a small amount of ablative heat shielding.We already know that the cost per flight for those goods is under a million dollars.We know the full cost of a Falcon 9 flown in expendable mode, is $63 million.If SpaceX can really refly a rocket 100 times, then your amortized cost per flight drops under $2M. To put 30 tons into orbit. That’s $66 per kilogram to orbit.Current spaceflight averages are in the $20,000 per kilogram to orbit. That means a 300x difference in cost.That’s not just a “leader” in space technology, that’s utterly disruptive to the whole industry.Spending $66 a kilo to put something into orbit is about three times the cost FedEx charges to ship a package overnight. Now you can get to orbit for three times the cost of sending cookies across the country as a care package. That’s going to open whole new industries in space.And no other country is close. Russia is claiming their new Angara rocket will be reusable, but they have yet to build even one.The traditional US companies are claiming Vulcan will be reusable, but they have yet to build even one, and they’re asking for $5 billion in research funding from the Air Force to build it.China is making noise about a fully reusable craft, but as I pointed out, their launch vehicle is based around the same technology that Russia has been using since the 1960’s, and they’ve taken to dropping first stages onto populated cities, which is not exactly going to be helping with national pride.The only competition for SpaceX right now is New Glenn, and that has yet to fly.In fact, their closest competitor might very well be……SpaceX.Their next rocket, the BFR (BigNo one else, no government, no nation, is even close to that.So, yeah, the leader in space right now — it’s a corporation, not a company.Honorable mentions: Rocket Lab is getting ready to send “It’s Business Time” — their latest Electron rocket — into space carrying several hundred kilos of cube-sats into orbit. They’re doing this for $7M a launch (estimated) which is still in line with the $20,000 per kilo launch price, but very few other services cater to micro-sat launches yet, so this is a way to get your own, personal cube-sat into orbit for less than the price of a new car.There’s also about a dozen other companies that are following in Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos’ footsteps and starting private launch companies.

Most high-school kids and 80% of all adults have smart-phones.For obvious reasons the Military industries are very advance and support our High-Tech Army. We have portable computers with most field-companies, drones overhead, the latest jets in the air and our satellites in the sky.Our tanks are technological wonders. The technology for tanks to fire, at a pin-point target while on the move-at 50 Km/h is made and used in Israel.We have robot boats, tunnel -destroying technology and face-recognition cameras in most ‘hot-spots’.The technology to shoot down enemy rockets-while in the air-over the enemy side of the fence is made in Israel and well applied.Our computerized and radarized anti-‘car-crash’ system is now sold all around the world.In medicine, We have the latest technologies and we have developed many of them....","5,990 followers",Jens Böttiger,566,2.6K,17.6M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Is-the-science-fiction-trope-of-an-advanced-technology-based-on-living-creatures-rather-than-machinery-plausible

20,"North Korea is a sovereign state and they are free to carry out any and all of the research and development they want to do on their own soil.  All they need to do is train people and procure the resources.  North Korea does have allies.  Sanctions impair North Korea's ability to conduct R&D efforts.  This slows things down, but it does not stop anything.North Korea has achieved amazing things given the conditions they are operating in- at the cost of a starving population.","1,438 followers",Michael Lipphardt,870,7.3K,7.7M,2016,https://www.quora.com/Is-the-science-fiction-trope-of-an-advanced-technology-based-on-living-creatures-rather-than-machinery-plausible
21,"UN sanctions do make it more difficult for North Korea to pursue its military ambitions, but far from impossible. Sanctions the UN imposes usually concern international trade. For instance, a UN sanction might force North Korean ships to undergo an inspection in any foreign harbor, or it may prevent the North Korean regime from (legally) importing luxury goods aimed to benefit the country's elite.In theory the UN sanctions should prohibit North Korea from launching rockets and having nuclear tests.In practice North Korea is probably the world's most cunning black marketer.

North Korea's illegal trading activities are facilitated in large part by the two-faced role China plays. In short, China injects the North Korea economy with billions of Dollars every year. It doesn't take a lot of imagination to see where a lot of this money ends up going.As long as China keeps granting the North Korean economy some pulse, the North Korea regime will not bother itself with angry letters from the UN.Finally, as others already pointed out here, North Korea's space program (""NADA"", I'm not kidding) isn't exactly the cream of the crop when it comes to technical sophistication. I'm not a rocket scientist, but it would seem most people working for NADA aren't either.David Pan",UNKNOWN,"Raymond K.

22,"North Korea obtain Soviet SS-1 SCUD missile systems decades ago.  During the 1980s they decided to reverse engineer and produce their own versions of the Scud missiles and created many variants (Scud-C,  Scud-D) for domestic and export. They also experimented with scaling up the Scud design to create the No Dong Medium Range Ballistic Missile which was exported to become the Pakistani Ghauri missile.  They then decided to cluster those No Dong engines to test fly the TD-1 missile with a No Dong second stage.  The TD-1 only flew once in 1998.

25,"Ballistic Missiles are actually very very complicated things. They don’t just have to be designed to incredibly high standards, but also manufactured to incredibly tight tolerances. The slightest flaw anywhere in the process results in a dud missile, one way or another. Bad fuel, bad metal, a dud navigation chip, a hair too little bracing on a minor part of the structure. When you’re moving that fast, with such a heavy load, pretty much any flaw is fatal.","26,858 followers",Janus Dongye Qimeng,877,0,0,2017,https://www.quora.com/Is-the-science-fiction-trope-of-an-advanced-technology-based-on-living-creatures-rather-than-machinery-plausible
