1,"I guess, it would be using powerful next generation game engines like unreal engine 5 instead of render engines.That way the render time could effectively decrease several thousands times. I mean it takes like at least 30 minutes to render a single frame of a high quality 3d animation with Arnold render or similar tools.Instead in Unreal Engine you get 30 frames per second. Mathematically speaking:30 minutes x 60 seconds x 30 frames = 54,000 frames instead of the just 1 frame in 30 minutes.And it is already done in Unreal Engine 4 too. But with Unreal Engine 5, there would be such drastic imprI guess, it would be using powerful next generation game engines like unreal engine 5 instead of render engines.That way the render time could effectively decrease several thousands times.

But with Unreal Engine 5, there would be such drastic improvements in picture quality that makes using conventional rendering methods totally absurd and obsolete, except for very few exceptional cases where insanely high picture quality would be very very critically important.",755 followers,Landen Drake,714,1.2K,5.6M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-next-technology-leap-beyond-electronic-ignition-for-the-internal-combustion-engine
2,"AI animation systems are looking very promising. There are demos of AI allowing fluid motion in an environment, such as automating ducking, touching the environment to steady an avatar, vaulting fences, squeezing through nooks, etc. The AI gathers all motion types and procedurally uses them in situations that current games haven’t done. I expect higher quality animations will make games feel more “alive” than the stiff ones we have in most games today.","246,830 followers",Dushka Zapata,1.5K,8.5K,232.4M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-do-you-think-is-the-next-technology-like-3D-and-2D-technology-that-will-change-animation-forever
