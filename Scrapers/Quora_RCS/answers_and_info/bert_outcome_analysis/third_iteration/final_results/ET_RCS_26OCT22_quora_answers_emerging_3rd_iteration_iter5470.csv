With this revolutionary technology, humans have successfully colonized the entire Solar System, allowing them to travel from Earth to Mars, to back again with relative ease.

With this revolutionary technology, humans have successfully colonized the entire Solar System, allowing them to travel from Earth to Mars, to back again with relative ease. What once would have taken years to travel to, can now be achieved in a matter of seconds.Sounds easy-peasy right?Well there is a catch, of course!YouIf you are conscious while Jaunting, you will go insane, your consciousness doomed to an eternity of oblivion.Imagine being left to only your thoughts, in an endless field of white, for what would feel like billions of years, your sanity slowly disintegrating and mind starting to auto-cannibalize itself.“How long in there, in terms of years? 0.000000000067 seconds for the body to Jaunt, but how long for the unparticulated consciousness? A hundred years? A thousand? A million? A billion? How long alone with your thoughts in an endless field of white? And then, when a billion eternities have passed, the crashing return of light and form and body. Who wouldn't go insane?”For this reason, every person who goes under the Jaunt must be asleep and unconscious. The solution to this is to put everyone under general anesthesia before take-off.But what happens to the poor unfortunate souls who don’t go to sleep? Here is what happened to little Ricky, who held his breath while the attendants administered the anesthesia.The thing that had been his son bounced and writhed on its Jaunt couch, a twelve-year old boy with a snow-white fall of hair and eyes which were incredibly ancient, the corneas gone a sickly yellow. Here was a creature older than time masquerading as a boy; and yet it bounced and writhed with a kind of horrid, obscene glee, and at its choked, lunatic cackles the Jaunt attendants drew back in terror. Some of them fled, although they had been trained to cope with just such an unthinkable eventuality. The old-young legs twitched and quivered. Claw hands beat and twisted and danced on the air; abruptly they descended and the thing that had been his son began to claw at its face. ""Longer than you think, Dad!"" it cackled. ""Longer than you think! Held my breath when they gave me the gas! Wanted to see! I saw! I saw! Longer than you think!"" Cackling and screeching, the thing on the Jaunt couch suddenly clawed its own eyes out. Blood gouted. The recovery room was an aviary of screaming voices now. ""Longer than you think, Dad! I saw! I saw! Long Jaunt! Longer than you think-""It said other things before the Jaunt attendants were finally able to bear it away, rolling its couch swiftly away as it screamed and clawed at the eyes that had seen the unseeable forever and ever; it said other things, and then it began to scream, but Mark Oates didn't hear it because by then he was screaming himself.So remember kids, always go to sleep, so you don’t turn into a creep.In all seriousness, this is probably one of the creepiest technologies available because it combines my 2 biggest fears:It just seems so tempting too. It’s like the elephant game. Tell someone not to think of an elephant. Then they probably automatically think of elephants! Same theory goes with Jaunting, I am sure after being told not to be awake during Jaunting only helped to increase Ricky’s curiosity. And I can relate to that.Also, the Jaunt technology opens up all sorts of sinister possibilities. The Jaunt is purported to have been used by tinpot dictators to get rid of political dissidents, and imagine if someone with connections kicked you awake into a Jaunt portal, while closing up the other exit, leaving you screaming in limbo for eternity….Anyways, I got a flight to catch, see you on the other side of Io, loser.The Jaunt - Stephen King (large text for mobile).pdf","135,539 followers",Hector Quintanilla,582,1.2K,88.6M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-do-you-believe-is-the-most-impactful-emerging-technology-that-has-yet-to-catch-the-public-eye

ASW has always been the wicked stepchild of the undersea world. Nothing replaces being on station and being able to touch an adversary and satellites are next to useless for ASW, despite lots of promise. (nobody spent money for that)Everything from the QDR to USN evaluations and even Senator McCain, US ASW capability, and that of ALL of the West is prehistoric and not kept up with modern threats. Even USNI has no bragging article of US ASW prowess,(since there really isn’t) but mostly begging for funding or illuminating the threat.Exercise after Exercise, Subs go undetected, including now twice the Chinese popped up in RIMPAC alongside the carrier.Swedes have many times had Kilo Class Submarines only a few hundred meters in their own harbors and they cannot find them once submerged. Modern wealthy countries have nothing to do with capabilities. More often Sosus informs Sweden their friend is visiting or its human who sees the mast from shore.A decade ago, I was at a SEAL show and tell. A Senior Chief was showing off their SDV. I mentioned I bet the North Koreans have the same thing and the whole room laughed. its turns out they have lots of them. A submarine is the poor man’s NAVY because its effective and among the most lethal platforms at sea. Its also the greatest fear of a Carrier Group Commander.The US cannot detect most submerged objects in Littorals and has nothing in inventory that can do that now. (that means Carriers stay in deep water far offshore) It is because of the US ASW posture that Colombian drug smugglers build more submarines than all the countries in SOUTHCOM combined.No other country has done more research and developed more inventory in nuclear torpedos than Russia. It can wipe out an entire fleet with $100K munition.The Technology pieces exist, but the systems are meagerly updates of the 1980s. Even the SOSUS and towed arrays are ridiculously old. We can’t find the newest German, Japanese and North Korean midget subs. its a very sad state of affairs.You can read all the Tom Clancy books you want, but its not going to make ASW great again and neither will the 2018 defense budget.",103 followers,C M,1.5K,1.3K,6M,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-interesting-emerging-technologies-with-potential-applications-to-Transhumanism

The Chinese could sink a US carrier group in ASM range if it wanted to. It’s hard, but doable.But -1. It would not happen. If there is the slightest chance of something kicking off kinetic, ie real shooting, the US Carriers will keep out of the threat envelope of the Chinese mainland ASM threat. That’s why the Chinese build them - to ensure the CBGs stay away from the mainland, not to kill carriers but to limit their use close to the mainland. You cannot kick off a surprise war with the Americans in this day and age, that’s impossible. There will be warnings, intelligence and analysis as you just can’t keep something like a preemptive strike on a US CBG secret. Also the moment the Chinese launch even one from land bases (let alone from a submarine or ship) and the Americans will know. Their satellites will see it clear as day in real time.

With the proliferation of precision-guided munitions like guided anti-ship missiles, surface ships including aircraft carriers are increasingly vulnerable.War today is dominated by the logic that if a target can be detected it can be destroyed. Surface ships like aircraft carriers are increasingly vulnerable due to their acoustic, electronic and radar signatures, making them easy targets. This new logic has taken over due to the fact that the economics of this new form of warfare highly favor the attackers. US Navy surface ships in a carrier battle group range from $2 billion in the case of destroyers to $14 billion in the case of the carriers themselves.A US Carrier Battle GroupTo protect themselves from this threat, carriers rely primary on their escorts in their carrier battle group. Every US aircraft carrier is escorted by at least 1 nuclear-powered attack submarine, 1 cruiser and 2–3 destroyers when deployed. All of these ships have significant anti-submarine warfare capabilities of their own. Additionally, the aircraft carrier can rely on its fleet of SH-60 Seahawks to detect and sink submarines.SH-60 SeahawkNevertheless, submarines are at a distinct advantage on this new battlefield, because they are far harder to detect than surface ships. Additionally, many modern submarines are capable of firing anti-ship missiles, giving them stand-off capability. For instance, the Russian Yasen-class will eventually by capable of carrying up to 32 zircon hypersonic missiles. These missiles are incredibly difficult to intercept and have a range far exceeding that of the SH-60. As a result, in a competition between a carrier strike group and a Yasen-class, the Yasen-class is likely to come out on top.Yasen-Class Cruise Missile SubmarineWhile common diesel submarines like the Kilo Class might not be able to fire off as many anti-ship missiles in a salvo against a carrier battle group, they would still have some distinct advantages in a battle with a carrier battle group. In addition to being quieter and therefore harder to detect, submarines like the Kilo class and its successors are far smaller and cheaper than most surface combatants. An Arleigh Burke-class destroyer costs approximately $2 billion. By contrast, a Kilo-class submarine costs $300 million.
