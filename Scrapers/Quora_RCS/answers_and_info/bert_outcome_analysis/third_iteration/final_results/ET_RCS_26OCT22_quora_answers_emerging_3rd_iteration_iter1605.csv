You name it, we’ve got it.#3: VR.Unlike other technologies, VR can neverIt will simply be a compliment, an enjoyment, a tool. But that doesn’t mean it won’t be widespread.One, VR can be used to capture video, and play them back in such surreal reality, that real life can’t compare to it. (That’s an exaggeration.)Two, VR can be used to visualize models, charts, designs, and make dataThree, VR can be used to play games, and keep ourselves so immersed into a story, and action, that it can be entertaining. No doubt video-game stores and malls will be full of sections dedicated only to VR gameplay.

Video calling will replace it.-Much faster internet speed. 7G or 6G atleast.-All watches will be smart watches. They will support fitness counters and mobile accessible apps.-Live photos over still pictures. This trend should pick up in the next few years.-Air purifiers will be installed in homes - especially in the metropolitan cities.-Shopping will mostly be online through apps.

They might be someone who could never afford to fly unless someone subsidized their effort (military) or paid them (flight instructor?).If you want to be a pilot, you better be willing to put every other thing secondary. You better be willing to move. You better be willing to get up at any time of the day or night, go accumulate some hours.

To heck with fire, flint axes, the bow and arrow, fishing hooks and nets, agriculture, the lever, the inclined plane, the arch, metallurgy, carpentry, electricity, plumbing, radio, the transistor, liquid crystal displays, packet-switching networks, cell phones, the Internet protocols, and the web browser.","58,987 followers",Michael Wolfe,504,2K,17.3M,2013,https://www.quora.com/What-technologies-will-be-in-our-everyday-life-in-the-next-5-years
32,"Transfer learning in ML models.Humans are really good at generalizing. We only have to see a few dogs before we can recognize a dog when we see one.Machines are not. ML models require millions of examples before forming a reliable classifier, and that classifier is very specific to the data on which it was trained. If your training data doesn't include dogs with three legs, the model won't recognize them. A machine that plays Go is useless at checkers.Transfer learning is the ability to apply a model from one domain to a different one.

A machine that plays Go is useless at checkers.Transfer learning is the ability to apply a model from one domain to a different one. It's hypothesized that the reason humans learn so quickly is that we are fitting new examples into our existing knowledge rather than forming entirely new categories. If we could teach machines to do the same, they would learn exponentially faster and apply that learning more effectively.Transfer learning is a very hot topic in AI research right now, so I expect major breakthroughs in the next few years. I think this may be sufficient to achieve artificial general intelligence, but even if not, it will dramatically extend the range of tasks that machines can accomplish.",650 followers,Ryan McKillen,724,0,0,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-technologies-will-be-in-our-everyday-life-in-the-next-5-years
