1,I don't understand why we need to sell nukes to any nation in the middle east.All mid East countries want Israel dead. And the West for.that matter.The only reason Saudi is our ally is because we told them your either with us or against us. And they like the money we give them for oil.Even the religiously fanatical can be baught in the middle east.I seriously disbelieve these efforts can be true or wise.If America ever goes bankrupt the entire middle East is going pro Russian and there will be another hullacost in Israel.I've been looking at it. The only reason turkey is part of NATO is becausI don't understand why we need to sell nukes to any nation in the middle east.All mid East countries want Israel dead.

The only reason turkey is part of NATO is because of territorial stakes in Europe and they are also acting as northern guardian to the middle East from Russian invasion. They need NATO help to stop that.Notice how they fight the american Kurds in Syria.

I think as long as we can understand how animals communicate with each other we can communicate with them.E.g., there're artificial tails and I think humans can use it to communicate with cats.","5,800 followers",Savas Abdulhamid Cicekci,16.4K,103,6.7M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Do-Trumps-and-Jareds-efforts-to-sell-nuclear-technology-to-Saudi-Arabia-endanger-Israel-MBS-told-us-that-he-will-develop-a-nuclear-bomb-Are-they-in-for-a-quick-buck
3,"I talk to my animals every day. They understand much of what I say. They read my body language too. I watch their body language to verify their understanding. My cousin talks and sings to his cattle. He tells them what gate to go through. They follow his directions. We do not talk about things that are out of their range of understanding, and we pay attention to their responses.We don’t need tools for that.",366 followers,Abhimanyu Roy,13K,0,0,2021,https://www.quora.com/Do-Trumps-and-Jareds-efforts-to-sell-nuclear-technology-to-Saudi-Arabia-endanger-Israel-MBS-told-us-that-he-will-develop-a-nuclear-bomb-Are-they-in-for-a-quick-buck
4,I’m not familiar with G-force. I do know there are no translation devices that have been created to allow us to communicate with animals.There are studies where we listen to the vocalizations of many animals. But interpreting their sounds to their peers is nowhere near trying to understand what they’re saying.,10 followers,Sajeev Rajan,6.6K,1.5K,46.7M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Will-technology-one-day-allow-us-to-communicate-with-animals
5,"Animals already talk. They say everything they need to, and if you take the time to learn how they communicate you will see this for yourself.If you mean “where animals can speak English”, probably never - unless you change the animal to the point where it can think like we do. Otherwise you’re essentially looking for a voice box that gives single words/phrases for things we can already deduce.",36 followers,Adam Ambrozy,579,0,0,2018,https://www.quora.com/Will-technology-one-day-allow-us-to-communicate-with-animals
6,"There are several possibilities for military technologies in the future.One technology that could come into prominence is the introduction of robotics into the military.RoboticsWe technically already have robots in service, such as drones, but they are not true robots that can think for themselves.DroneEntering robots who have some rudimentary AI can help many tasks in the military become more streamlined, such as using robots to help increase the efficiency of logistics.Your courier is here!We could also use these robots to help inspect aircraft before they are allowed to fly.AircraftThere arThere are several possibilities for military technologies in the future.One technology that could come into prominence is the introduction of robotics into the military.RoboticsWe technically already have robots in service, such as drones, but they are not true robots that can think for themselves.DroneEntering robots who have some rudimentary AI can help many tasks in the military become more streamlined, such as using robots to help increase the efficiency of logistics.Your courier is here!We could also use these robots to help inspect aircraft before they are allowed to fly.AircraftThere are many applications for military robots and this is just a snippet of their total number of applications.Another way military technology can progress is to enhance our troops using technology.Having a mere helmet and a flak vest wouldn’t do in the future.Nope.aviDARPA is almost finished on a suit that gives troops superhuman strength, allowing them to easily carry equipment that can weigh around 100 pounds!DARPAAnd that’s not all.There are plans for an Exo-suit that gives Its user enhanced strength and protection which is known as TALOS (TALOS versionsAnd finally, we could see the arrival of widespread use of electrically fired firearms.ElectricityIt's important to note that electrically firearms are already a thing, thanks to the Metalstorm machine gun.Metalstorm machine gunIt fires the bullets electrically, as seen in this picture.How Metalstorm worksThis way of firing bullets can be applied to anything, including pistols.Pistol metal stormThis is the future and I am honored to be able to see It with my very eyes.That’s all folks!",55 followers,Wade Black,1.9K,0,0,2018,https://www.quora.com/Do-Trumps-and-Jareds-efforts-to-sell-nuclear-technology-to-Saudi-Arabia-endanger-Israel-MBS-told-us-that-he-will-develop-a-nuclear-bomb-Are-they-in-for-a-quick-buck

Rather, they are being driven by many technologies. Advances in surface-to-surface missiles, surface-to-air missiles, lasers and various different kinds of radars are threatening to make fighter jets obsolete. For the past 50 years, fighter-bombers have been some of the most powerful and versatile weapons systems on the battlefield. They were largely responsible for the US’s stunning victories in the Gulf War and elsewhere, serving as the backbone of US defense strategy. Nevertheless, a number of technologies are coming online that are spelling the end of the era of fighter dominance.Over the past decade, countries like Russia, China and Iran have fielded a number of precision-guided cruise and ballistic missiles that are specifically designed to take out US and allied fighters at their bases. Fighter jets spend most of their time at fixed, known bases. This makes them easy targets for modern, precision-guided, stand-off munitions.Similarly, Modern air defense systems equipped with high speed surface-to-air missiles are becoming extremely difficult for planes to evade. During earlier conflicts, pilots could outmaneuver or jam enemy air defenses. However, modern air defenses are increasingly difficult to jam, because they can be equipped with frequency hopping radars. Additionally, the performance of missiles has significantly increased over the past couple decades, making it extremely difficult to outrun and outmaneuver modern SAMs.In the coming years, a number of laser technologies will come online that will make it even more difficult for aircraft to stay aloft in contested skies.

8,"This: a high quality, twist-locking carabiner. I’ve encouraged many people who train with us to carry this. It is nigh-indestructible, provides a place to clip your keys to your belt or hang a bag (or purse) from a counter, stool, table or chair. It provides quite a lot of functional utility. It is not a weapon. It can function exactly like a kubaton, which essentially serves no other “non-weapon” purpose. If you're going to carry a mini-baton you might as well carry a knife. It’s still a weapon, just a less efficient one. The advantage is that most average-sized people can fit their four fingThis: a high quality, twist-locking carabiner.

If you're going to carry a mini-baton you might as well carry a knife. It’s still a weapon, just a less efficient one. The advantage is that most average-sized people can fit their four fingers inside of it and get a very steady grip. This leaves the bottom loop exposed under the hand and creates an excellent striking surface.If asked post-incident what someone used to strike an attacker, with a carabiner the answer is “my keys”. It will be a hard reach to articulate that a simple loop that has so many utilitarian uses was purposely being carried as a weapon. It becomes a weapon of opportunity if needed, but under a potentially life-threatening attack, so would anything else that a person randomly picked up to protect themselves.Caveat: the true importance in personal defense cases like these relies heavily on being able to articulate a reasonable fear that one was actually in danger.Caveat 2: this is not legal advice, just a perspective on potential personal defense options.Edit: I used this specific item as an example because it is most likely to be legal everywhere. Obviously other non-firearm weapons like tasers, pepper sprays and knives have their place, but people often live in places where these, as well as firearms are not legal to carry.","5,990 followers",Jens Böttiger,566,2.6K,17.6M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Will-technology-one-day-allow-us-to-communicate-with-animals
