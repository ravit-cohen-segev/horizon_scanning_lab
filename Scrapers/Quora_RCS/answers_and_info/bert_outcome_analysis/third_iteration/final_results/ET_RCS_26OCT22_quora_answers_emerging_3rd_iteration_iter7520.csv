What is a Bitcoin?A Bitcoin is form of currency which is similar to the old US  ""Gold Standard"" currency system, but its directly tied to the internet and is the world first free market global currency.  Bitcoins can be exchanged for other currencies, goods or services.1. Where do Bitcoins come from?I’ll now try to explain the words ‘Lottery’ and ‘Gold’ in terms of Bitcoin mining.‘Lottery’‘Gold’So for all you smarty kids out there, would you agree it makes more sense to invest in a currency that is finite, like Bitcoin, or infinite, like the US dollar?2. How do Bitcoins have real world value?People worked their asses off for at least a few months/years to mine these things, plus all the hardware and electricity they used.  This is where the initial value of the currency is born, since time and money was used to create them.Put yourself in the shoes of a miner, you put time, $$$ and brainpower into mining these coins against thousands of other people around the planet. You’re not just going to give them all away for free. Everyone wants to get their money back from these things (risk vs. reward), so people started exchanging Bitcoin for different things including currencies like the USD and Euro.  In return this allowed new people outside of the mining ring to get into Bitcoin and the network began to grow, which started to create a networking effect.Now normal everyday people are exchanging cash for Bitcoins.Wondering what the hell can I do with these things?3. Why are people investing so much money into bitcoin?Given all the problems we’re seeing in world economies, like what happened at Cyprus. People are rapidly beginning to lose faith in their standard currencies like the EUR and USD.  I mean the government can literally seize your assets in the bank if things get as bad as they did in Greece.  With Bitcoin they can’t.  They have no access to your funds.  Your Bitcoin wallet is essentially your own bank.  It’s similar to the idea of people stuffing cash into their mattresses, except this is a lot more profitable and accessible.  It’s basically the gold rush of the 21st century.ConclusionWhom ever Satoshi Nakamoto is, they're a freaking genius. I hope he/they come forward one day.Did I help you out?

The fundamental concept to explain is this “ledger” list of transactions and how clever mathematics make this list trusted by anyone without the need to ask some authority about it.",26 followers,Balaji Viswanathan,17.1K,5.6K,427.2M,2017,https://www.quora.com/How-do-you-explain-Bitcoin-to-a-6-year-old

More crypto investors joined the bandwagon in various methods, including staking coins to earn interest and spending them in metaverses. Crypto mining is still one of the most effective methods to profit from the rise of digital currency. In reality, miners’ computers compete by solving complex mathematical equations that aid in the verification of digital currency transactions and update the blockchain, a shared ledger. They get a portion of the cryptocurrency linked with the blockchain they are members of as a reward for addressing these difficulties.Crypto mining: What Is It?A common misconception about crypto mining is that it is simply used to create new coins. However, cryptocurrency mining also involves adding cryptocurrency transactions to a distributed ledger after they are validated on a blockchain network.Additionally, crypto mining prevents a distributed network from double spending.Due to the fact that it must be debited from one account and credited to another whenever a member spends it, cryptocurrency has a similar impact on the ledger to physical currency. The problem with digital currencies is that they are easy to manipulate. As a result, Bitcoin’s distributed ledger can only be updated by verified miners.It is therefore up to the miners to prevent double-spending.During this period, new coins are generated by the network to reward the miners. The mining process is crucial to validating transactions on distributed ledgers because there is no centralized authority.By participating in the validation process, miners are rewarded with newly minted coins, which incentivizes them to secure the network.Only verified cryptominers are able to mine and validate transactions when a proof-of-work consensus protocol is in place. It also makes the network completely unaffected by external attacks.Bitcoin mining: should you do it?The machine must be operated 24 hours a day, and electricity bills will be high. Even then, earning bitcoins is not guaranteed.Is bitcoin mining environmentally friendly?Activists believe that bitcoin mining is environmentally unfriendly due to its heavy electricity use. As much electricity as an entire country is drawn by bitcoin mining. With the transition to renewable energyFour steps to mining BitcoinBuy mining hardware for Bitcoin.To mine bitcoins, you need special hardware. It’s called a mining rig. Ordinary domestic computers could mine bitcoin at the outset of the currency’s history. Because of Bitcoin’s popularity, the algorithm’s complexity had to increase, which forced the need for more computing power. It consists of a specialized chip called an ASIC. The majority of miners use ASIC chips.Bitcoin’s consensus algorithm exists solved with the help of these powerful machines.Install the software you prefer to mine Bitcoin.You must now download the software required to connect your mining rig to the Bitcoin blockchain once you have your Bitcoin mining rig set up. New blocks are added to the blockchain by the software, and Bitcoin mining can be there with several free software programs.Join a Bitcoin mining pool online.Despite the latest hardware and software, an individual would not be able to mine Bitcoin. Large mining farms backed by major mining companies are not competitive for small miners. A Bitcoin mining pool provides a solution. The group can use the combined computing power of individual miners to compete collectively. The pool operator charges fees and rewards somewhat lower than personal mining. However, by using a pool, you can ensure frequent rewards.MineNow that you have chosen a pool, you can begin mining bitcoins. Plugin your mining equipment, connect it to an electrical outlet, browse to the Bitcoin blockchain using the software you choose, enter the details for your Bitcoin wallet, and choose a mining pool, and you’re ready to go.How much does a Bitcoin miner make on average?While single Bitcoin miners may struggle to make a profit, individuals joiningReturns on Bitcoin mining must be sufficient to cover the cost of electricity and initial investment in mining equipment to generate a profit. Bitcoin miners concentrate on low-cost power, low-cost technology, and a solid Bitcoin mining pool to offer themselves the most excellent chance of success.Another factor to consider is the tax on Bitcoins that are mined. It is unlikely that a miner will make a profit, but you may be required to pay tax depending on the jurisdiction.Furthermore, the profitability of Bitcoin mining operations is governed by cryptocurrency prices. Bitcoin must maintain a high price to compensate for mining equipment and power expenses paid for in fiat money.",2 followers,Kelly Pearson,1.7K,0,0,2022,https://www.quora.com/How-do-you-explain-Bitcoin-to-a-6-year-old

In the technology’s early days, for example, CPU mining was the go-to option for most miners. However, many find CPU mining to be too slow and impractical today because it takes months to accrue even a small amount of profit, given the high electrical and cooling costs and increased difficulty across the board.GPU mining is another method of mining cryptocurrencies. It maximizes computational power by bringing together a set of GPUs under one mining rig. For GPU mining, a motherboard and cooling system is required for the rig.Similarly, ASIC mining is yet another method of mining cryptocurrencies. Unlike GPU miners, ASIC miners are specifically designed to mine cryptocurrencies, so they produce more cryptocurrency units than GPUs. However, they are expensive, meaning that, as mining difficulty increases, they quickly become obsolete.Given the ever-increasing costs of GPU and ASIC mining, cloud mining is becoming increasingly popular. Cloud mining allows individual miners to leverage the power of major corporations and dedicated crypto mining facilities.Individual crypto miners can identify both free and paid cloud mining hosts online and rent a mining rig for a specific amount of time. This method is the most hands-free way to mine cryptocurrencies.",18 followers,Asim Qureshi,1.4K,996,156.1M,2022,https://www.quora.com/How-do-you-explain-Bitcoin-to-a-6-year-old

Something that he can use to later go to his cellmate and give him in return for the book that he wants from him. The cellmate also needs something in return for the book to use for getting himself another book.How do you do this without money?Well, they use cigarettes as a currency. A hair cut is worth 20 packs. A chance to play basketball is worth 10 packs. A book is worth 5 packs and so on. There is a problem. There are not enough cigarettes inside the prison in each person’s hands to be able to do all the transactions. But everyone knows that once a week a new supply comes in. So instead of getting the packs from each other, they start “owing” each other some packs of cigarettes. Joey gets a haircut and he owes the barber 20 packs. The barber gets a book and owes John 5 packs. Once the new shipment comes in, everyone will settle their debts.But how do we keep track of all this?Well, everyone will have to carry a notebook with them. Whenever two people make a transaction, they both write it down in their books. Luke writes “I owe Johnny two packs” and Johnny writes “Luke owes me two packs”. This way we know who owes what to whom. But we all write everything in the same format. One transaction after another. So it becomes a long chain of transactions. If I know how many cigarettes I had at any point and go through the transactions after it, I can figure out how many cigarettes I will have.Last problem: how do we know what people wrote in their books are correct and no one is faking transactions? I can go steal someones book and write a fake transaction in it.Well, to overcome this we assign the wisest most trustworthy person in the prison as a witness. Whenever two people are making a transaction, he has to witness it and sign both books with his own signature. This way, we know that each transaction is witnessed by our trusted person and actually happened.Cigarettes are bitcoin. Notebooks are ledgers.
