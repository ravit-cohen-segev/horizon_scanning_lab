Well, unfortunately, those microbots are impossible, but there is a similar technology that’s being developed in real life.The idea is to build tiny replicators that can create more of themselves, like a sort of super bacteria that never stops replicating. Such a technology would be“…the first replicator assembles a copy in one thousand seconds, the two replicators then build two more in the next thousand seconds, the four build another four . . in less than two days, theyNanotechnology, but in a really cool way.You remember the microbots in Big Hero 6, right?

But they would have an abundance of material on Earth, especially of carbon, which would likely be the building blocks of such an assemblers. If you were carrying a jar of them and tripped and they spilled out, and they had no limit, they would quickly devour the entire earth with no way of stopping them.But here is where things get interesting: These tiny robots would have the ability to construct molecules from atoms, giving them the ability to produce amazing materials like graphene, cubes of apple, and even brain material.With advanced nanotechnology in the form of self-replicators, the entire world would experience a revolution. Think for a second about what wouldn’t change in the face of machines that can produceProduction jobs would cease. The price of every item ever created would be lowered massively. Supercomputers and experiments regarding brain material would become almost commonplace. Terraforming other planets would take years if not months. And all of this is actuallyThere is a lot of power contained within those tiny machines.","91,598 followers",Roland Bartetzko,1K,3.4K,314.6M,2017,https://www.quora.com/Can-you-briefly-describe-some-upcoming-revolutionary-technologies-in-the-field-of-computer-science
