He is a lead architect of AMD’s Infinity Data Fabric and an expert in processor, caches, coherency and memory subsystem architecture.You know AMD, right? The company that drove Intel into the dust?He manages the Infinity Fabric architecture and design team which delivers coherent interconnect protocol and technology across all AMD products.Nathan joined AMD in 2002 and has been in the industry for over 25 years.He has a Bachelor of Technology degree in Electronics and Communications Engineering from NIT, Kurukshetra, India and a MSEE degree from Texas A&M University, College Station, Texas.Compute Express Link™ (CXL™) is an industry-supported Cache-Coherent Interconnect for Processors, Memory Expansion and Accelerators. CXL technology maintains memory coherency between the CPU memory space and memory on attached devices, which allows resource sharing for higher performance, reduced software stack complexity, and lower overall system cost. This permits users to simply focus on target workloads as opposed to the redundant memory management hardware in their accelerators. ​CXL is designed to be an industry open standard interface for high-speed communications, as accelerators are increasingly used to complement CPUs in support of emerging applications such as Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.​September 16, 2019The core group of key industry partners announced their intent to incorporate in March 2019, and remain dedicated to advancing the CXL standard, a new high-speed CPU-to-Device and CPU-to-Memory interconnect which accelerates next-generation data center performance.The five new CXL board members are as follows: Steve Fields, Fellow and Chief Engineer of Power Systems, IBM; Gaurav Singh, Corporate Vice President, Xilinx; Dong Wei, Standards Architect and Fellow at ARM Holdings; Nathan Kalyanasundharam, Senior Fellow at AMD Semiconductor; and Larrie Carr, Fellow, Technical Strategy and Architecture, Data Center Solutions, Microchip Technology Inc.It has taken him 25 years to get there; and that is the true measure of an engineer’s success: to be on a standards body.▲Rakesh is Product Development Engineer at Intel Corporation, Krishna, Andhra Pradesh, India.This is my problem.

I see that you are bundling a wide range of firms in your tags for this question.As a CSE, the answer you can extract will depend onThere are definitely some firms that tend to get a lot of buzz and glamour for being 'Best'. But if you chase these 'Best' firms and lose sight of your interests and development needs, you'll either fail to get recruited by them or you'll fail to be happy once the high of being recruited by them goes away. My usual advice to engineers at the end of school is to find a few things that they want to invest 3-5 years becoming an expert on and then find a place where they can pursue that learning.  If you like working on Algorithms, then work on projects that put you at the top 20% of those with relevant skills at your age group and experience level, then you'll easily find yourself moving towards working for the best companies in that space.
