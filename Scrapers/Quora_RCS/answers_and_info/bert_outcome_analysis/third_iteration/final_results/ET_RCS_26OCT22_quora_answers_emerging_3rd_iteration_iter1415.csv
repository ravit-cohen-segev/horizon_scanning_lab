2,"Ethical internet: Tech brands need to take a more proactive approach to exploring ethical implications of their platforms and wares, according to tech journalist Kara Swisher in NYT article.In May 2018, Amnesty International, Access Now and other partner organizations launched the Toronto Declaration, which protects the right to equality and non-discrimination in machine learning systems.More andEthical internet: Tech brands need to take a more proactive approach to exploring ethical implications of their platforms and wares, according to tech journalist Kara Swisher in NYT article.In May 2018, Amnesty International, Access Now and other partner organizations launched the Toronto Declaration, which protects the right to equality and non-discrimination in machine learning systems.More and more tech companies are realizing the order of magnitude that their products have on societal issues like mental health, isolation, cyber-bullying, and suicide.Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, wrote in a blog post on Medium: ""For all the good we've achieved, the web has evolved into an engine of inequity and division; swayed by powerful forces who use it for their own agendas. Today, I believe we've reached a critical tipping point, and that powerful change for the better is possible -- and necessary.""Future tech cities: Tech brands are turning their attention to every aspect of life and reimagining these areas with tech solutions. Now Urban design is getting a rethink for a hyper-connected future.Tech giant Alibaba is developing a City Brain artificial intelligence layer. It is testing elements of the AI in Hangzhou. Thousands of street cameras are used to collect data to control traffic lights, optimize traffic flow, detect accidents, and deploy respondents.However, constant surveillance and the data it generates has the capacity for the greater good and personal invasion of privacy.As technology companies roll out their solutions to urban problems, privacy advocates are ringing alarm bells over the potential abuse of on-going surveillance.Also: 5 technologies you'll get sick of hearing about in 2019 [ https://www.zdnet.com/article/5-technologies-youll-get-sick-of-hearing-about-in-2019/ ]Humanizing tech: Tech brands try to blend in to our homes and bodies to seamlessly integrate into our everyday life. The shift will be toward services that are made to smoothly integrate with the user.Information is presented in playful, non-threatening ways, complete with carefully constructed imperfections and idiosyncrasies.Brands are trying to have a friendly identity, such as Uber's new rounded fonts, Grindr's creation of Kindr -- to foster a more welcoming environment, and curved, rounded, tactile audio speakers that blend in with home decor.Real-time tech: Advances in technology are incorporating devices and materials with biological capabilities, turning them into an extension of the wearer's body. Products and devices that instantly adapt to their surroundings shows how intuitive technology is becoming.Reebok released a shape-shifting sports bra in August 2018 that adapts to wearers' movement. The material incorporates a thickening fluid which changes texture in response to movement. The bra stiffens to provide more support while moving, and softens while the wearer is at rest.Puma, in partnership with the MIT Design Lab, has created adaptive shoes that respond to the wearer's fatigue.The insoles use bacteria that responds to sweat and collects biological information about the wearer. Electronic circuits detect changes, transmitting data to help prevent fatigue and improve performance.Social media wellbeing: Growing pressures caused by using social media have had a negative impact on mental health. Mental strain due to social media can encompass unhappiness, anxiety, and depression.There are over three billion social media users, according to statistics from Hootsuite and We Are Social.Facebook's research team said in December 2017 that ""when people spend a lot of time passively consuming information -- reading but not interacting with people -- they report feeling worse afterward.""Social companies offering a social platform are taking responsibility by cracking down on heavy consumption and antisocial behavior, and by educating users with new research. Finding a measured way to use social media is key before everyone gives up their accounts for good.Also: 7 Technologies that will transform Advanced Manufacturing in 2019 [ https://www.zdnet.com/pictures/7-technologies-that-will-transform-advanced-manufacturing-in-2019/ ]Sound empires: From the explosion of audible entertainment to the expansion of listening formats, your ears are becoming a key gateway to brands. Apple AirPods, introduced in 2017, are becoming normal ""always-in"" earbuds.Spotify has introduced Spotlight, which integrates video content into podcasts alongside audio. Amazon-owned Audible has released 77 original audio works between 2017 and 2018, according to The New York Times.According to Ericsson's TV and Media 2017 report, 70 percent of consumers now watch television and video on mobile devices, a figure that has doubled since 2012.The pattern is expected to continue, with Ericsson estimating that by 2020, half of all viewing will be done on a mobile screen. These platforms represent a shift toward mobile-first entertainment, particularly among young smartphone users.Tech's hidden figures: As with every aspect of culture and popular discourse, the #MeToo movement, fourth-wave feminism, and widespread vocal discourse about white male patriarchal power are ...","58,988 followers",Michael Wolfe,504,2K,17.3M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-will-be-the-next-big-technology-fad

9,"A technology revolution is both desperately needed and highly likely to come in the area of mental health. This is true for three reasons: (i) mental health has reached crisis status, (ii) mental health is a booming area of medical research with high levels of tech transfer from academic labs, and (iii) brain technology is benefiting greatly from tech advances in other fields.Mental Health Crisis1A technology revolution is both desperately needed and highly likely to come in the area of mental health. This is true for three reasons: (i) mental health has reached crisis status, (ii) mental health is a booming area of medical research with high levels of tech transfer from academic labs, and (iii) brain technology is benefiting greatly from tech advances in other fields.Mental Health Crisis1 in 5 American adults experience a mental illness. [1] [2] This number is likely to be higher in developing nations. If you live past the age of 60 you have a nearly 30% chance of being killed by some form of dementia.  [3]The prevailing theory used to posit that alleviating socioeconomic hardships would drive down all diseases; while this is true for many diseases of the last century, by virtue of longer life-spans other diseases have emerged, most famously: dementia. Other mental health challenges are also on the rise—Those suffering from Autism Spectral Disorder make up approximately 1 in 132 individuals (and growing) [4], 1–3 of every 100 will experience epileptic seizures in their lifetime,  [5]and a whopping 1 in 10 with mood disorders [6].Biomedical Research: Focus on the BrainIn 2011 nearly a quarter of the National Institutes of Health $32B budget went to ‘neurosciences’ related projects.  [7]The proportion of brain work through this agency has bloomed following new initiatives focusing on breakthrough technological advances from the field [8].While some areas of basic research have legitimate reasons to complain about stagnating funding, medical research cannot. The NIH currently provides 50% greater funding than it did in the year 2000. Much of this growth has occurred in brain research. That being said, it is also easy to say that it isn’t enough to meet the demand and needs of those afflicted with debilitating disease. When the quality of life of 1 in 5 humans is on the line, mental health issues should continue to take a front and center position among public policy issues.

Even if the heart is rejected and the donor dies, what we learn from the process will enable us to succeed the next time. I reckon this will become the mainstream way we get spare parts by the end of the decade in an optimistic scenario, by the end of the next decade in the pessimistic one.Either way, the moment is as groundbreaking as December 3rd, 1967, when the first human heart ever was transplanted, ushering the era of organ transplants of today.
