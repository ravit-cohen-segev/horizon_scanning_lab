2,"From a technical standpoint:From a technical standpoint:From a business angle also you are in uncharted territory, so there is much uncertainty in pricing, go-to-market models and approach, customer acceptance (and overall demand uncertainty), required infrastructure (if any), etc. All these factors are unknowns and getting them right is critical to eventual success of your product or company.The above factors add up to why technopreneurship is such a thrill and such an incredible experience and why so many of us are so eager to take the plunge.","358,971 followers",Sean Kernan,11.4K,5.6K,727M,2019,https://www.quora.com/If-I-am-interested-in-researching-the-effects-of-emerging-technologies-and-social-media-on-the-mental-and-behavioral-health-across-generations-what-field-should-I-seek-a-degree-in

Frequent outages, hours of hold times on the call queue and nothing I could do about it.Disclaimer: I am on the marketing team at Nextiva - a business communications company.Why do I love working with Nextiva? Because our founder believes in customer service so much, that the company was built on that principle. Nextiva even trademarked the phrase “Amazing Service [ https://www.nextiva.com/amazing-service.html ]” because we believe in it so much.Here’s the Reality:Customers expect employees to have excellent customer service skills [ https://www.nextiva.com/blog/customer-service-skills.html ] nowadays.We are living in the world of online reviews, where companies with shitty customer service can no longer hide in the shadows.Unfortunately, there are still too many businesses who do not get it - and that’s the problem.Businesses Need Multiple Ways for Customers to Connect With Them:Too often, there have been times when I wanted to live chat with a support representative on a company’s website, and it wasn’t available.Sometimes I just need a QUICK ANSWER and don’t feel like waiting for hours to talk to a rep on the phone.Whenever this happens - I feel a sense of frustration.Solely having a phone number for customers to call is not enough. Businesses must provide ample opportunities for customer service experiences to happen.When I decide to reach out to a business, I want to do it when and wherever I want.

4,"Chatbots, all the way!Chatbots can improve customer satisfaction - if used right.Conversational marketing already is one of the cores of effective customer support and sales. With chatbots, your agents can actually take a breath instead of answering tedious requests. While chatbots can’t eliminate the human factor and replace people (EMPATHY is the key), they can help solve their issues and requests quickly.I’d also highlight the importance of knowledge bases - they are so underestimated but with them, you can save up to 60% on operational tasks and customer service queries.There are a few morChatbots, all the way!Chatbots can improve customer satisfaction - if used right.Conversational marketing already is one of the cores of effective customer support and sales.

5,"China. Think of it as a very large very populous “Wakanda”. Genius devoted to STEM — plus absolute control of a material resource essential to even fielding a team into the ‘paradigm-revolution’ game. For “Wakanda©”? STEM genius + “Vibranium™” — and for China? STEM genius + ‘Rare Earth Elements’.China (along with its East Asian neighbours sharing the South China Sea ‘cul de sac’) worships faithfully at the altar of ‘optimal return on investment’.

For “Wakanda©”? STEM genius + “Vibranium™” — and for China? STEM genius + ‘Rare Earth Elements’.China (along with its East Asian neighbours sharing the South China Sea ‘cul de sac’) worships faithfully at the altar of ‘optimal return on investment’. This (and, for Japan, Taiwan, and South Korea, relative lack of sufficient indigenous raw material resources) millennia ago informed and moved their socioeconomic evolution to a sharp focus on ‘value-adding’ as the essence of wealth creation within their cultural context. (Really it is an understanding that ought to drive all economies — if they wish to remain viable in the ‘real evolving world — especially on that ‘cutting edge’.)‘Value-added’ is a synonym for ‘technology-applied’. And ‘technology’ is no more nor less than ‘intellectual properties’. STEM. ‘Science’ discovers, isolates, identifies, ‘factual things’. ‘Engineering’ innovates ‘factual things’ into problem-solutions. ‘Technology’ is in the business of manifesting and utilizing those problem-solvers. A short term for a problem-solving device is ‘tool’. (Math? It separates scientific sanity from superstitious insanity. In science math filters data into fact and fancy — in superstition belief filters math in an effort to substantiate and support beliefs. China, as a nation, has no use for superstition — and eyerolling tolerance for it. This offers a huge advantage over cultures where ‘big wheel yada yada faith — little wheel yada grace of god’ compromises STEM’s ‘well-oiled machinery’ with superstitious dross.) In other words? It’s not just that China was anSo. Bottom line answer to Q#1 — what I thought of as “eagerness to adopt new revolutionary technology”? Yes. Yes China is an eager adopter of evolutionary or even paradigm-changing revolutionary advances. Committed to technological progress — and the inevitable contigent and consequent socioeconomic/cultural evolutions.On to Q#2.Competing.China’s vision of the future of cyberspace is intent on one single salient endgame. That intent being? Simple. Pre-emption of the metastasizing American hegemony and preclusion of that hegemony’s entrenchment as an enduring status quo. It’s a noble vision.China is far from alone in this — its perspective is shared by most of the planet beyond the red/white/blue stars’n’stripes-cum-stars’n’bars’ aggregation ‘America’. The concern over America’s presumption of righteous aegis over that infinite tangental territory we all so blythely dub ‘cyberspace’ simply expresses the same concerns vis a vis ‘actual’ space-time territories. America can envision only a single tolerable global village — the vision that has America encastled above the village. That has village affairs kept orderly by an overarching ‘Pax Americana’. It’s either ‘Pax Americana’ . . . or no pax at all. China begs to disagree. As do pretty much all the several hundred nations largely define themselves as ‘No interest in being an orbital satellite of America’. 121 of them are long-time members of the de facto ‘not interested in the American pack’ community organization: the Non-Aligned Movement. My Canada and the countries of the European Union? De facto we’re spiritually and philosophically ‘on the same page’ — we’re just ‘too chill’to join anything we’re not charter members of. Include us? 150 nations. Representing a similar majority of humankind. Nations running the spectrum from theocracies through autocracies and oligarchic plutocracies to various forms of democracy — all sharing one common perspective and vision: we want America leashed or else sent to ‘good doggie etiquette school’ .America’s squandered decade after decade on ‘power projection’ in the cause of bringing ‘we the at best ‘quaint’ but commonly ‘shit-hole’ households of the global village’ into (grateful?) defferential ‘alignment’. China? Quietly invested the same decades in the same boring repetitive contractual and nonverbal insistance that it predicated its eagerness to trade on mutual noninterference in each the other’s domestic affairs. China will keep its distaste and disapproval to itself — and those wishing to trade will do likewise. Australia has recently taken to reneging on that tacit fundamental. China has shown its disappointment. China’s “Whatever” shrug dismissing ‘alignment’ from ITS ‘we can do business together’ criteria.China, by rejecting ‘alignment’ as a ‘requisite virtue’ has become a trusted friend of the nonaligned. Of the ‘de jure’ ‘dues-paying’ ‘tee-shirt-wearing’ NAM members —China’s vision of the future of cyberspace is pretty much akin its vision for space — which is fundamentally its geopolitical vision. Which is? A world that finds the idea of ‘hegemony’ — any hegemony — counterproductive to global optimization and therefore unacceptable. The Rest of The World choruses “F___-yeah. Amen.” to that.Q#3.Is China influential in the evolution of rules and standards governing behaviour in international cyberspace? Most certainly. And rightly so. Every nation — and every person — has a natural inalienable right and an ethically unshirkable responsibility to participate in the evolution of our universal cyber society. China, like the EU, has the right and responsibility to ensure that cyberspace isn’t American territory under American jurisdiction shaped for America’s benefit.Before rules and standards can be negotiated into a code? Various standards and rules — especially standards — are competitively fielded. Standards and rules that are abstracted into and entrenched as code must first survive the gauntlet-run of consumer-driven market reality. The realities brought to bear by the technologies themselves — in their natural convergence — and in the consequent/contingent changes their convergence make complexly inevitable. China’s clearly a powerful agent in those evolutions. China among others. And, apparently, America has now begun to grasp the reality that ‘American global hegemony’faltering a half decade ago is now terminally-ill and aliveonly via ‘extraordinary measures’. In recent days [26/04/2021] Secretary of State Blinken — on behalf of the American government — declared that the nationsof the EU — and specifically of NATO — would incur no American emnity were they to not align with America against China. This addressed the reality that Europe has been making clear — if America pressed for an ‘EU/AM’ alignment — the presure would only drive them closer to ‘laissez-faire’ diplomacy China. A face save. And an admission that the era when America could presume the world would either stand aside or fall in line? That era is over.And nowhere is that more true than in the open range of cyberspace.",12 followers,John Cate,935,14.4K,186.2M,2021,https://www.quora.com/If-I-am-interested-in-researching-the-effects-of-emerging-technologies-and-social-media-on-the-mental-and-behavioral-health-across-generations-what-field-should-I-seek-a-degree-in
