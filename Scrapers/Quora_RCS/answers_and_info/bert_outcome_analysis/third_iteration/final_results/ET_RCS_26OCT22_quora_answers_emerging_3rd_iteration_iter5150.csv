After all, writers have a 33% chance of losing their jobs to automation within the next two decadesI wrote about this in my book,It’s not just oncologists that could be at risk of automation. After all, writers have a 33% chance of losing their jobs to automation within the next two decadesBut I doubt it will be as bad as that. AI is highly skilled at certain specialized tasks, but we won’t see the software taking over jobs that are fundamentally human. Don’t just take my word for it – take it from Neil deGrasse Tyson. In a stunning YouTube video in partnership with Mashable, the celebrated astrophysicist weighed in on the debate of whether to send robots or people into space. Tyson believes that it’s an irrelevant question. Here’s what he said:Split the question into two parts. Are you only interested in scientific discovery? Send robots. It's cheaper. You don't have to bring them home. If you only care about science then there's no rational reason to send humans, really. For the cost of sending a human, you can send 100 robots. And robots are getting better, smaller, cheaper, faster, smarter, all of the above. But here's the catch. I've never seen a ticker tape parade for a robot. I've never seen a high school named after a robot. I never saw a kid read a book about a robot and say, gee, I wanna be that robot one day. There's value in human inspiration. It's less tangible than the scientific results of an experiment. It's more emotional. It's more philosophical. It's more cultural. It's more human.And humans can deduce things way faster and more intuitively than robots can, at least for now. We can see something we've never seen before and then interpret it. Computers currently only think the way we've programmed them to think. Take a robot and take a human and have them confront something they've never seen before. Whose analysis are you gonna want first? It's gonna be the human analysis, at least for now.Maybe the day will come when robots will be smarter than humans. But it's very hard to program a robot with curiosity for something it’s never seen before. How to process information it knows nothing about. And if you program a robot that has consciousness and curiosity, is it even ethical to send that robot on a space mission with no intent of ever bringing it back? Are you killing a sentient being? So maybe there's a whole frontier we have yet to breach.At first, that may sound like it has little to do with the world of artificial intelligence in healthcare, but many of the same arguments apply. Picture a future in which healthcare technology has progressed to the point at which human doctors are irrelevant. Would you rather receive a devastating diagnosis from a human or from a robot? And how many people would prefer to be operated on by a human surgeon instead of a robot – even if the robotic operation was statistically less likely to lead to complications?We’re entering a period of history in which a new type of ethics is coming to the forefront. If AI progresses until it’s indistinguishable from a human, should it have the same rights? For the technology to continue to progress, we may need a ratified bill of rights for AI software that’s designed to protect friendly AI while shutting down unfriendly AI for the greater good of the world as a whole.[1][2][3][4]","220,610 followers",Franklin Veaux,10.5K,47.3K,782.8M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Will-technology-replace-the-need-for-health-care-professionals
1,"A while ago, when we were exhibiting the Mitra robot at an event, a doctor walked up to me and broached on this subject. He was quite strong in the view that we are killing jobs of receptionists, security personnel and so on.I told him politely that doctors like him have put most shamans, black magic healers and village medical practioners out of business. Is that not wrong? To make it worse, their science has removed many diseases and make it hard for other doctors to get business. Dammit you scientific people - destroyer of jobs!And the mother of all job killers in humanity was agriculture.A while ago, when we were exhibiting the Mitra robot at an event, a doctor walked up to me and broached on this subject.

Dammit you scientific people - destroyer of jobs!And the mother of all job killers in humanity was agriculture. General purpose AI and singularity would not even come near the “chaos” that agriculture created. Until 12000 years ago, ourThen these random dudes and dudettes come with their mastery of wild seeds. And before long, food production became a much easy thing. A single farmer in a few acres of land could produce more food than dozens of hunters attacking many square miles of forest. This gave rise to the “Instead of foraging and hunting, most people got involved in other things - like pottery, painting, urban planning, building homes & drainages, administration, mining, jewellery, accounting, medicine…A few thousand years later, another bunch of dudes would start harnessing the power of steam and create “nasty” things like locomotion. Rather than beating our horses to get to the next village, we would get to the other end of the continent reading newspapers. We moved around, explored things. Rather than using little children for many jobs such as chimney sweeping we kept finding better methods. Eventually the horse carriage workers and others moved on to other things.We often confuse general purpose AI with robotics.Let’s assume the worst case and we have a general purpose AI - that can do everything a human can. What would happen?It would be only as bad as agriculture - that destroyed most of what we did everyday. We could be doing things like sports. In most video games, bots are way better than humans. Does it mean we are less likely to play with other humans? In fact, we would play more with other humans just because the bots are better than us.We would do art, psychiatry and so many more human fields that we have not even created. Just like people could not imagine separate professions like art before the invention of agriculture, we have a problem with imagination.And we would spend more time with our children - who often grow alone with their TVs and more time with our parents - who often rot away alone.But, this is assuming there is a general purpose AI. Robotics is not the same as general purpose AI.Oh, what about movies like The Matrix and Terminator. Oh, you guys are now giving us Hollywood? If you believe in those weird movies, do you also believe in other dystopian movies like “I’m a legend”? In the latter movie, a germ gets out and wipes out most of humanity. Does it mean we have to close down the pharma and medicine industry?Hollywood can paint a dystopian picture from anything possible. They have even made something as harmless as vacuum cleaners into dangerous things. Should we stop doing all of them?In fact, anything useful can be made dangerous - think fire, water, air, cars, electricity, trains, medicines, petrol, sugar - any of them can kill you very easily.Anything that cannot kill you, is not of much use to you.Robotics, like any major revolution, can indeed cause chaos in the society. No different from agricultural revolution or industrial revolution. There will be displacement. People said the same for computing too. Could the people who were worried about computers doing spreadsheets in 1970s have thought about the whole new industries created by computing 40 years later?But, there are a whole set of important things that are not effectively today and we need robots there. Let me give you some examples of these:It need not always be life threatening. You walk into most stores now, and it hard to find anyone to assist you. The robots could walk with you, understand your requirements, help you shop and get things on your vehicle. It could play football with your children and take them off TV.I could give you 100s of such examples and that is the future. But, to get there we have to have more simpler robots doing more mundane things. A baby has to go through the toddler stage before becoming an adult.40 years ago, your parents would not have imagined what you do with computers. They could not have thought of the kind of revolutionary applications that we take for granted.A new revolution is beckoning us.

6,"I feel compelled to answer this question, because I disagree with most of the answers here.The common answer here seems to be: yes it will kill jobs, but only the jobs low on the food chain, and it will create more jobs to at least offset the jobs it does kill.I disagree. I think AI will kill jobs, and over time, AI might kill most “jobs” as we know them.

I think that people are somewhat complacent in regard to the economic impact of AI, and will likely be ill-prepared for the changes we have to adapt to in the not-so-distant future.First, let's start with the comparisons to machinery and automation. They did indeed put factory workers out of work. In that respect, I agree AI today is similar in many applications, replacing workers who have less specialized skills, perhaps call center operators, office assistants (in a limited extent), and maybe soon, taxi drivers and truck drivers. But I would argue that AI is fundamentally different from machinery or most of the other analogies commonly made when answering this question, because AI is growing and is unlikely to stop growing. It's growing in breadth (of applications and industries), in geographic and economic scope, and in power (it's capacity to address increasingly complex tasks). A more fitting analogy would be machinery in an automobile plant that not only made the parts one day, but then learned how to assemble them the week after, and then how to design cars a year later.I think that there is little that is out of reach for advanced AI of the future. Let's leave the question of the AI singularity alone for now. Instead, I think that deep learning efforts at Google and elsewhere are making AI systems learn faster and faster, with a growing rate of acceleration. Advanced AI can now address increasingly complex tasks including medical diagnosis, stock market trading, weather prediction and human behavioral modeling. Very soon, it will be able to take the place of certain types of teachers, and find a role in education. It can already deal with complex systems in software and mathematics, and seems to be only limited in applications that require interactions with the physical world (sensors are still imperfect), and with people.So without projecting too far into the future, we can ask the question, what jobs will NOT be killed by AI? Jobs that involve labor are already (or soon to be) replaced. Jobs that require logical reasoning are being replaced, albeit at a slower rate. What are the qualities that humans have that cannot be captured by AI? Perhaps creativity, emotional responses? So perhaps researchers in academia will survive longer than most, and artists (though AI stylistic mimicry is already quite impressive and their results enjoyable), and counselors/psychologists/case workers, and decision makers like CEOs who cannot be predictable or error prone. And hopefully software engineers and algorithm designers who develop AI systems.This leaves a very, very small portion of today's jobs intact. Many say: we just need to train people to fill higher level jobs created by AI, e.g. Programmers, ML researchers. But this is no easy feat. The US educational system is struggling to meet the demands created by advanced technology today. This failure is in part responsible for the economic divide plaguing the country today. The challenge of educating the public for a job market that is both decreasing in scope and increasing in complexity, is nothing we've ever faced before.I am far from original in this opinion. But if I had to guess, I would say that AI will put far more people out of work than we can (re)train in time. That will have significant economic repercussions as corporations seeking to minimize cost will do so at the cost of rising unemployment. There will need to be dramatic changes in social policies in order to avert large scale economic disaster, first dramatic rises in minimum wage, then eventually some type of universal income/welfare. It's the kind of change that requires significant leadership in our government, something that seems woefully absent today.","41,554 followers",Rakshith Akira,4K,467,18.3M,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-jobs-to-choose-if-AI-or-robots-going-to-replace-most-of-jobs

Go back 50 years in time, and you will find people back then never looked to computers beyond mathematical computations and now without computers we can’t sustain.Technologies change and evolve all the time and we always end up changing with them and those who fail to adapt to change are thrown out from the civilization up gradatioShort answer is Yes, Blockchain will sure replace may of the traditional technologies being used by us.read below for the extra long explanatory answer.When we talk about technology we are always present focused, meaning we never look beyond what is available to us. Go back 50 years in time, and you will find people back then never looked to computers beyond mathematical computations and now without computers we can’t sustain.Technologies change and evolve all the time and we always end up changing with them and those who fail to adapt to change are thrown out from the civilization up gradation race.Lets discuss a case study on one of the Blockchain company, Cashaa which is focused towards Fin-tech sector and how a company like Cashaa, by making use of Blockchain can replace the exiting technology of fin-tech sector.Cashaa is next gen digital bank built on blockchain. if you go deep into the history of its inception, you will end up with a name “BTC2BID”. This was the name given to prototype version of Cashaa. This prototype remittance app was used by people to exchange crypto currencies with real cash and this allowed people to buy sell different currencies by eliminating the remittance companies like WesternUnion and MoneyGram completely. This also mean that these people paid zero fees for these. The prototype product of Cashaa was an instant hit and by the time they closed the support for the prototype product, the app had successfully allowed 12500+ traders from 147 countries with 97 different currencies to trade 2100+ bitcoins.With the success of the beta app, the team moved on with full fledged development of Cashaa and by 2016, they had made so much significant progress that they launched the public token sale of CAS Token which is the fuel of Cashaa ecosystem.Now, lets come back to why Cashaa will shatter the traditional Fin-Tech sector. Lets first talk about the current fin-tech sector, specifically the remittance industry. The current remittance industry is dominated by the brick & store companies like Western Union and MoneyGram . Although Banks too have a good share in international money transfers using their SWIFT network, however they are expensive and more time consuming than the companies like WesternUnion.So when you go to a store of WesternUnion to send money to some one sitting in other country, the store executive takes few information about your receiver and once you confirm the amount which you want to send, he gives you a total payable amount including the fees and the forex rate applicable. Usually people here ignore the fees and forex rates as they get to send money to their receiver in less time and within minutes, the reciever can go to a western union store in his country and submit his identity proof and collect the money.There are 2 key problems here. First is that the receiver is bound to go collect the money from a western union store and if there isn’t one near him he has to go find it. Second thing is the forex rate. When you have to send the money you usually don’t care for the forex rate as sending money would be your priority and this is what cashed out by companies like WesternUnion. These companies usually give you a bad forex rate, and its obvious as they want to make profits.They can’t simply rely of fees as there are lot of middle men involved with WesternUnion and majority of the fees goes to these middle men.Now with Cashaa, all of these problems are solved by making use of Blockchain. If you analyze the primary aspect of a remittance company and an end user using the company to send or receive money, it is trust. Now that is the basis of blockchain. Blockchain concept is based on a universal trust concept hence there is zero chance of anything wrong happening with the transaction. Now digging deep into the Cashaa platform, what we see is that when you want to send or receive money using cashaa, Cashaa internally does the following:Now compare this with the traditional remittance companies, Cashaa has no middle men, so no need of Cashaa to charge extraordinary fees.The only fee which is charged is while initiating the transfer to the sender and that to it is minimal charged in the form of CAS token. Since the currency exchange is happening over crypto, you will get the best forex rate, better than any other forex exchange in the world.It’s true that the companies like WesternUnion and MoneyGram will collapse for sure ,but hey not every one is adamant to change. Who knows either of these companies or some low level companies make moves and integrates with cashaa payments platform and still survives.So finalizing the answer, yes blockchain will for sure replace the current technology but the industry will also adapt to it for a greater prosperity.","31,157 followers",Phillip Remaker,1.7K,11K,78.8M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Will-technology-replace-the-need-for-health-care-professionals
