1,"Hi.In my opinion the game changer across the board is going to be the next generation batteries.Goals: Charge cycles in the 10 thousand range, ultra high storage capacities in the KW range, negligible power leakage and finally affordability.This would would pretty much put every thing around you up to a new level:On and on and on.The good news? We are getting closer to that day yearly.Hi.In my opinion the game changer across the board is going to be the next generation batteries.Goals: Charge cycles in the 10 thousand range, ultra high storage capacities in the KW range, negligible power leakage and finally affordability.This would would pretty much put every thing around you up to a new level:On and on and on.The good news?

Well, unfortunately, those microbots are impossible, but there is a similar technology that’s being developed in real life.The idea is to build tiny replicators that can create more of themselves, like a sort of super bacteria that never stops replicating. Such a technology would be“…the first replicator assembles a copy in one thousand seconds, the two replicators then build two more in the next thousand seconds, the four build another four . . in less than two days, theyNanotechnology, but in a really cool way.You remember the microbots in Big Hero 6, right?

But they would have an abundance of material on Earth, especially of carbon, which would likely be the building blocks of such an assemblers. If you were carrying a jar of them and tripped and they spilled out, and they had no limit, they would quickly devour the entire earth with no way of stopping them.But here is where things get interesting: These tiny robots would have the ability to construct molecules from atoms, giving them the ability to produce amazing materials like graphene, cubes of apple, and even brain material.With advanced nanotechnology in the form of self-replicators, the entire world would experience a revolution. Think for a second about what wouldn’t change in the face of machines that can produceProduction jobs would cease. The price of every item ever created would be lowered massively. Supercomputers and experiments regarding brain material would become almost commonplace. Terraforming other planets would take years if not months.

5,"1. Artificial Intelligence in web development (chat bots) -Chat bots are powered by AI to communicate effectively to improve user experience, customer support. When you browse through products in some website or an app then you visit particular category and then sub category like Women-> Clothing> Formal-> Color-> Size.Instead of going through all these categories, chat bots will be replaced by browsing and navigation. Like you can directly chat with the bot, place your requirements, it will display your choice of products.Creativity is a fundamental feature1.

Like you can directly chat with the bot, place your requirements, it will display your choice of products.Creativity is a fundamental feature of human intelligence, and a challenge for AI, especially in web designing. I am not sure whether AI will completely replace website designers but there might be a bot or a software where it will analyze user inputs or requirements and website will be designed as per user’s choice.In fact Wix website which is a popular website builder is using Wix Aritifical Design Intelligence technique to build websites. Its going to be launched soon!2. Progressive Web Apps (PWA) -PWA’s are actually websites but they appear to user like a normal app. We can get many benefits from PWA like app works offline, fast loading, safe, responsive.3. Motion UI -Motion UI is a front end framework which helps web designers and developers to create excellent animations, Sass maxims and Css animations. It is the next emerging trend especially in 2018.4. Javascript framework (Angular js 2 and 4) -Angular js is already trending in the field of web development and it will continue to be implemented in future too. Its biggest advantages are templates, MVC, dependency injection. There are other frameworks like Node.js, Meteor.js, ReactJs which are going to be more trendy by next year.","9,705 followers",Tim Mensch,626,3K,18.8M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Is-there-a-website-that-keeps-track-of-upcoming-technology-business-announcements-press-releases-or-launches

So you have to be always on your feet and learning.

10,"The traditional answer would be:I think this is all in the process of changing, though. The open-source movement is making proprietary software like MATLAB and LabVIEW less attractive. Python is taking over for scientific computing and is also making its way into IoT/embedded and robotics.
