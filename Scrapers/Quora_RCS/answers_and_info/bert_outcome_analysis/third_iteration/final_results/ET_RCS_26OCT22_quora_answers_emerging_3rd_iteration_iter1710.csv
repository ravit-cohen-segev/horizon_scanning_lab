4,"Thanks for the A2A and a great question. The answer is straightforward. The problem is, not many (unlike you and me) concern themselves with the question. Obviously one needs to be technical to see what’s wrong with the industry. Otherwise it’s vague Forbes “trend” analysis. So what’s really wrong? We have amazing gadgets, self-driving cars, slick websites/apps, and mind-blowing AI (ML, etc.) algorithms backing them. All of that space-age tech is getting better every year. Unfortunately things are not so rosy in enterprise software.Advanced as they are (also arguable), 10 or so of topThanks for the A2A and a great question. The answer is straightforward.

All of that space-age tech is getting better every year. Unfortunately things are not so rosy in enterprise software.Advanced as they are (also arguable), 10 or so of topRegardless of the fresher front-ends, the enterprise technology dates back to late 1970s (Oracle’s relational database invention). Half of business software is even older than that: the mainframe crap saved from Y2K. Take a moment for it to sink in. The original creators of that software never expected it to linger that long and live past year 2000, hence they didn’t allocate the precious (at the time) two additional digits for the year. “Averting” Y2K was a huge step backward - akin (sorry, steampunk fans) saving steam (or carburetor) engines in a similar manner.Did IT try to replace COBOL and the rest of that stuff with newer technology? It did and failed. The infamous IT (meaning outside of Googles and Facebooks) project failure rate of 70% started to manifest itself in the late 90s during those attempts. The technology was no longer adequate to tame the runaway business process complexity - regardless of the project budget and headcount, which predictably made things way worse.Larry Ellison’s invention: related tables of data coupled with old-school procedural programming (the only one available at the time, not to mention the flat two-dimension data nature - inherently foreign to OOP and other modern programming paradigms) doesn’t scale well complexity-wise. Imagine doing even a moderate enterprise system in Excel with VBA macros, etc. Or Access for that matter. Yes, it’s possible. Just extremely inefficient - like an army of slaves building an Egyptian pyramid vs. a relatively lean team of modern construction professionals operating robust machines.Google’s, Facebook’s, and Netflix’s niches are different: consumer. Yes, they’ve invented a lot and donated it to the open-source community, but their products/services are still 100% consumer. Mighty Google won’t touch targeted (meaning always custom) enterprise software with a 10ft pole. Not cool enough, but more importantly very complex domain-wise - way outside of an average “algorithmic” techie attention span.What happened? An 18-year (since the Y2K) if not longer enterprise technology stagnation. Why it happened? I gave you a hint, recalling the Egyptian pyramids. Ever since the dawn of our technology-driven civilization it is the shortage of labor, that led to inventions to automate something. The surplus of cheap labor (found in a few well-known overpopulated countries) halts, and in some cases (pre-Y2K 1960s-70s crap) reverses the technical progress.How long that stagnation will last? For another 10 years, until everything saved from Y2K will crash and burn, as it was not very robust to begin with, let alone five bugs an average “outsourced” code monkey makes by fixing one - supporting that crap. The real Y2K was just postponed until 2030s. I am talking about major banks, hospitals, and the rest of Fortune 1000 IT. Security breaches, outages, and overall chaos. It’s going to get much worse.What can we do about it? Whether or not Google sees itself as a giant MIT or CalTech lab working on cool “scientific” consumer stuff, programming is the same, and Google (Facebook, Twitter, Netflix, etc.) inventions can and should be adapted for the enterprise technology. It can only be done by people who spent a good portion of their career in corporate IT due to the aforementioned attention span issue.The freshest best of breed business process automation technology dates to 1999: Salesforce. And IMO it is just a meticulous optimization and refinement of the age-old Oracle Forms. Remember where Marc Benioff worked before he founded Salesforce.Developing the 21st Century enterprise tech is not rocket science. It is largely the art of putting together already existing pieces, though in a very unorthodox manner, foreign to all current approaches, that cater to man-hour happy Great IT Consulting Food Chain making its money on bloated bodyshop and “offshore” headcounts.Bashing those parasites is pointless. I am just merely pointing out, that people with money (investors, various Stanford- and Harvard-educated “influencers” and “visionaries”, etc.), a developer would seek to take him/her under one’s wing to finance his/her efforts, are not interested at all in the new gen business software development process/technology. It’s nothing new. Was IBM interested in financing Ellison’s relational databases? was Yahoo interested in financing Paige’s and Brin’s new search engine?See, the rich and influential always think that everything is fine the way it is. Google and “scientifically-minded” others consider it beneath them. All of the startup accelerators in between don’t understand that area at all, considering multi-million enterprise projects too complex and expensive to be done by a lean startup. Accelerators specialty is simple couple form SaaS developed with conventional technology e.g. admin database management front-ends and other “techie” things.Everyone thinks that the IT Consulting Food Chain is doing fine - by MBA standards. Oracle and Deloitte make a lot of money, don’t they? All that matters for technically clueless MBAs and ultimately the Wall Street. So don’t waste your time on pitching revolutionizing enterprise software development to one of those rich and/or connected “visionaries” in some elevator. Just go and do it (like yours truly) for a concrete project/product.What are you waiting for? You can event do it part-time. Everything is free (open-source) and highly efficient time-wise. Start by asking yourself how you can redo your dysfunctional, underpaid, and abused team’s project completely by yourself in 2–3 months, and you’ll figure out what tools you need to build to write 100x less code and otherwise be orders of magnitude more efficient.I don’t want to write several pages on the topic.

But they would have an abundance of material on Earth, especially of carbon, which would likely be the building blocks of such an assemblers. If you were carrying a jar of them and tripped and they spilled out, and they had no limit, they would quickly devour the entire earth with no way of stopping them.But here is where things get interesting: These tiny robots would have the ability to construct molecules from atoms, giving them the ability to produce amazing materials like graphene, cubes of apple, and even brain material.With advanced nanotechnology in the form of self-replicators, the entire world would experience a revolution. Think for a second about what wouldn’t change in the face of machines that can produceProduction jobs would cease. The price of every item ever created would be lowered massively. Supercomputers and experiments regarding brain material would become almost commonplace. Terraforming other planets would take years if not months.

In both Persian and Hindi, Aryan means noble, and has nothing to do with the Nazi ideology.This is just one example of the cultural exchange that have been between the two countries. Persian and Hindi are also closely related as they belong to the Indo-Iranian language family, which is a subgroup of the Indo-European language family.ThiIran views India as a important strategic and economic partner.

Persian and Hindi are also closely related as they belong to the Indo-Iranian language family, which is a subgroup of the Indo-European language family.This is a map of all countries, where Indo-Iranian languages, are spoken by a majority, and together the languages are spoken by 1.6 billion people as their mother tongue.Besides this, India is the country with the largest Shia Muslims population in the world, after Iran. So the two countries also have some religious ties.The Iranian President, Hassan Rouhani, praying in a mosque in Hyderabad in India, in unity with Indian Muslims, February 15th 2018.Historical TiesCurrently, there are more than 70.000 Parsi’s in India, which are of Iranian origin. Parsi means Persian. The Parsi’s that are Zoroastrian in faith, emigrated from Iran to India in the 7th century, following the Islamic conquest of Iran. They did so, because Zoroastrianism was prohibited in Iran so they were prosecuted, but in India they were granted religious freedom.It’s a huge tragedy, that the Parsi’s were treated as dirt and second class citizens in Iran, as they were a very innovative and bright people. But it were also a great sign of humanity, they were accepted and welcomed in the Indian society.Some notable Parsi’s includes:Economical TiesIran is the second largest supplier of crude oil to India, and as India industrializes further, it’s going to have an even larger demand. That’s why India is planning to double Iranian oil import within one year, and are one of the largest foreign investors in Iran’s oil and gas industry.In 2017 the Chabahar port was expanded on Iran’s southeastern coast, with help from the Indian government. The Chabahar port will provide an alternative route for India to Afghanistan and central Asia, bypassing Pakistan.The Chabahar port is also rival to the Pakistani “Gwadar” port, that is being built with help by China. Besides that, the Chabahar Port reduces India’s dependence on Pakistan, for trade with Afghanistan and it’s related neighbouring states. This deepened Iran and India’s economic and political ties.Iran has huge natural resources: Iran has the worlds second largest natural gas reserve in the world, and the fourth largest oil reserve in the world. Combined, only Russia has more natural gas and oil in the world than Iran. This is one of the reasons why India is one of the largest foreign investors in Iran’s oil and gas sector.On February 18th, the Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani, met with the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi.Both leaders held substantive and productive discussion on cooperation in trade and investment, energy, connectivity, defence and security and regional issues.-Raveesh Kumar, the Indian external affairs spokespersonSo I would say that Iran and India have very deep ties, given their shared history and culture, but the two nations also share many views, regarding the region’s future. Last but not least, India and Iran are also great trade partner’s and will probably be even more so in the future.",0 followers,Alex Nikov,14.5K,714,4.7M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-upcoming-technologies-used-in-the-field-of-software-engineering
