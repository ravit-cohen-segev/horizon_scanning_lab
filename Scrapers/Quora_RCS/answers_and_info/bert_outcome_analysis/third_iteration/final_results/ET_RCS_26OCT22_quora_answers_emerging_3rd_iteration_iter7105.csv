Then off course Ola put hard effort to increase supply so that it is able to reach the critical mass to sustain the businessWhen a customer opens the app, the app sends the location data of the customer to Ola server. Ola server then sends back the available car locations (which are nearer to the customer location) to the customer's mobile phone. Then when customer requests a booking, the information is sent to all the drivers (who are in neighborhood area). If a driver accepts the booking request the driver details is sent to the customerThe whole process needsBut there are some issues",UNKNOWN,Anonymous,1.6K,0,0,2016,https://www.quora.com/which-technology-is-used-to-develop-olacab-app

Technology is advancing very rapidly.My grandfather would have grown up in a world very similar to that of his grandfather, but in just my lifetime, there has been enormous change. When I was a student in the 1970’s, I lived in a house with no central heating, one telephone wired into the wall, and a black and white television with two channels. My Dad had a car, but it was technically not much different to the car he would have had twenty years earlier.

In case you are a developer and you have not, find yourself a favorite combo because you gonna spend a lot of time using it.I personally have an M331 Logitech mouse which has a simple design, low price but high quality and makes very little noise when clicking (important to me as the clicking sound usually pretty noisy at night and I don’t want people to feel annoyed about it).

So manipulating those symbols is a huge part of the job, which is where the editor or IDE comes in.Much of programming is “thinking on paper”, meaning literal paper if you don’t have a whiteboard to draw your diagrams, or on a whiteboard, or on the screen as you express and articulate your ideas in the form of code.Most programming is a team sport, thisLet’s skip past the obvious - a computer & peripherals and a programming language compiler or interpreter. And of course the programmer’s brain.Programs are a stream of symbols (source code) that the computer turns into mathematical operations. So manipulating those symbols is a huge part of the job, which is where the editor or IDE comes in.Much of programming is “thinking on paper”, meaning literal paper if you don’t have a whiteboard to draw your diagrams, or on a whiteboard, or on the screen as you express and articulate your ideas in the form of code.Most programming is a team sport, this is where whiteboards can be incredibly useful. Even if you’re a solitary programmer, diagramming things out can be critical.Revision control systems are important for lone programmers and essential for team programmers. Again it’s about dealing with those streams of symbols.Libraries, components, platforms and frameworks allow you to “use other peoples’ brains” and save yourself a ton of work, if you use them right. A lot of a programmer’s job is to understand these tools and how they fit together, and where the code they develop plugs into the picture.To that you can also add, to some degree, more powerful programming languages. “Power” in the context of programming languages means greater expressivity — again, programming is about manipulating symbols, so the greater the amount of things you can get done with fewer symbols, without sacrificing flexibility and scope, the more useful programming becomes.Approaching the same thing from the other direction, these days a lot of programming is not just about composing code, but about breaking the problem down into subsystems and getting all of them to cooperate and collaborate. This is where we get into things like docker images and orchestration systems and cloud platforms.In between the two are build tools (starting with the venerable make and up to ant, maven, gradle, etc), continuous integration tools (jenkins, etc), deployment tools, etc, and somebody has to get those working right. The line between development and deployment is no longer sharp and clear:But “most useful” is a tricky criteria to apply. In almost all of the above, the editor or command line is involved. That certainly makes “typing” omnipresent, but does it make it the most useful?While all of the above are critical, I’d have to say that the biggest force multiplier is libraries, components, platforms and frameworks, and more powerful languages. Programmers these days accomplish a lot more in terms of providing end-users with functionality, largely due to these.","246,868 followers",Dushka Zapata,1.5K,8.5K,232.5M,2018,https://www.quora.com/In-what-ways-is-technology-develop
