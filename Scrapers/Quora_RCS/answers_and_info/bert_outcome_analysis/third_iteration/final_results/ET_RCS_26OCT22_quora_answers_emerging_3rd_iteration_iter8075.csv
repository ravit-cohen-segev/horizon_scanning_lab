Although almost all the data it enumerates are false, exaggerated or lack credible sources.The quality of China's GDP is indeed not high enough. A large number of low-end manufacturing industries account for a relatively high proportion. However, the author claims that American workers have more robots to help production, so American workers are more efficient, but this is obviously a wrong conclusion. Because there are still a lot of jobs that must be produced manually by skilled workers, and in the field of robotics, such as the textile industry, China has long been the most advanced and powerful country. When the manual textile industry was transferred to Vietnam and Bangladesh, printing and dyeing factories in Zhejiang, China were purchasing and upgrading automated textile machines in large quantities, which were 20 times more efficient than manual production.If the author's conclusion is correct, then the more efficient world manufacturing center should still be the United States. but it is not the truth.The author also cited other disadvantages of China. For example, he believes that China's private companies have insufficient R&D investment and that the scientific research capabilities of universities are not strong enough. Although the author obviously does not understand the leading role of state-owned enterprises in the Chinese economy, his evaluation is still valuable. The accusations from the enemy will help us to improve.However, the mentality changes shown in this article are very interesting. Yesterday, when Reuters reported on the G7 foreign ministers meeting, the headline was: The West is not over yet. Some time ago, when Biden called for ""the unity of the Liberty Alliance"", he declared that he wanted to prove that ""democracy still works."" But in fact, if God is truly omnipotent, then you have no need to prove that God exists.In fact, Western political elites like Biden are still trying to monopolize the interpretation of the ""Bible"", that is, ""democracy and freedom."" They are like the Holy See before the theocratic rule was overthrown by the civilian priests. Democracy is not equal to Western vote politics. It is still effective. For example, in China, democracy works very well.Devout religious believers should not prove the existence of God to us atheists through logic or scientific methods. Once they did this, they fell into a predicament predetermined by scientific logic. The West today is very different from the West that arbitrarily tried to build a ""Middle Eastern democratic world"" twenty years ago. The most devout believers seem to have begun to shake their faith in God.I have always maintained that the Western world’s belief in so-called ""democracy and freedom"" is not based on any facts or logic, but on the Christian doctrine after the Reformation. ""Justification by faith"" is the source of their psychological defense. The obsession with this political concept is simply because they have to believe in some false illusions. To pierce this illusion, you need not to persuade them, but to learn how to say ""F*ck you"" , with a language they can understand.Whether or not they believe that China is a paper dragon is their topic. China does not need to follow its topic setting, because there will be more and more articles about injecting faith into Americans by explaining the ""Bible"" like this. Reading their articles, finding the valuable parts of them, and using them to improve China is what the Chinese should do.","1,859 followers",Donald Canton,2.3K,1.4K,7.6M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Is-China-a-paper-dragon

He then proceeded to joining Mayor Rudy Giuliani’s presidential campaign in 2008. Yes, tIs China a ""paper dragon""?I didn’t read the linked article. I will never read the linked article, or anything else Mr. David Frum ever write. But I can tell you what this publication aimed to do.The author of the linked article, Mr. David Frum, was President George H. W. Bush’s speech writer in charge of selling the Iraq War, which led to hundreds of thousands of civilian death, the rise of ISIS, religious cleavage of the whole country, impoverishment, and the waves of refugees inundating the whole region. He then proceeded to joining Mayor Rudy Giuliani’s presidential campaign in 2008. Yes, the one of the “Four Seasons Landscaping” fame. He was then recruited by The Atlantic, a “literary saloon” magazine founded in 1857 to argue for the abolition of slavery, because he was anti-Trump…So it’s kinda like Mr. Churchill walks into Berlin and hires Mr. Goebbels to write opinion columns, because he wants to reach out to the Nazis. The Atlantic is hoping that the Nazis will be more amiable if Mr. Geobbels tells them that for reasons 1 to 5, we can get our lebensraum without starting World War III. This is what counts for being “left wing” in the US nowadays.The big picture is that in WWII there was draft and 90% tax on the rich. Roosevelt, Churchill, Stalin - all of them had family fighting on the front line, getting killed, getting injured. Congress passed the GI Bill in the week of the Normandy landing. Basically, the rich needed the poor and the middle class to stuff the bodies so they paid. By Vietnam war, the draft was on everyone, and the 6% war tax was on everyone. Clinton, Trump, John Bolton, Dick Cheney, Giuliani, Romney, these are all famous draft dodgers. Basically if you were rich you didn’t have to go, The poor and the Middle class not only had to go, but they had to pay to fund their sons and daughters being shipped out to the Vietnam jungles. So you know what happened.The 60 - 70’s “left-wingers” were anti-war, period.Now being “anti-war” is a big problem for US foreign policy, because war is the ultimate form of coercion. If you won’t resort to killing the other guy, the other guy may end up with the ultimate freedom to say no to you. Do you want that???So the US politicians and generals put their heads together, hired a bunch of “intellectuals” to stuff “think tanks”, and pumped money. The new arrangement works like this:The rich still get the upside without the downside.The middle class don’t have to die for it (abolish draft) but still have to pay. The money they paid is split three-ways: a part goes to the rich arms dealers, a part goes to “job creation” by putting arms factories in every state (and well publicized by politicians to persuade the middle class to keep paying), a part goes to Hollywood, newspapers, “think tanks”, universities, to make wars glorious (i.e., that’s how “super heroes” get money, girls, and fame).The poor - I don’t care, do you. -/sThus in the last 30 - 40 years, the Republicans do tax-cuts. The Democrats do de-regulation. Both are pro-war and pro-one dollar one vote, but of course only wars we can win easily because nobody is volunteering to go back to paying 90% taxes and sending Eric Trump, Hunter Biden, etc., to the front line and actually get killed or maimed. Such is the current US political main-stream.PS: The problem is actually not with Mr. Trump or Mr. Frum. Every village has its share of village idiots and assh*les. The problem is that in normal villages, these guys get sent to watch goats, while in the US these guys get to be presidents and columnists for “intellectual magazines”, but millions and millions of really great people don’t. The New York policeman who bought shoes for the homeless in the winter. The San Francisco doctors who volunteered to go to New York to help with Covid surge. The chef who volunteered to cook food for people whose houses were burned down. Millions and millions of great people, why can’t they campaign for the presidency? Why can’t they get paid writing for The Atlantic? But the Trumps and the Frums do. Why? Is it … money?I mean it’s pretty much political consensus now that “nice guys aren’t gonna cut it” and “we need the biggest assh*le on our side to fight it”. A society consensus on the need for assh*les, and the popular anger not against the irresponsible top, but towards the bottom: the poor, the immigrants, the “jews (scapegoats)”, is NOT NORMAL!

If anyone still deny China's development and progress and stubbornly believe that China is no different from its weakness during the Opium Wars, I strongly suggest that he or she should come to China and see it for him or herself. If you always stand on the American territory and taking the position of the United States across the ocean, it is difficult to make an objective judgment on the real situation of China.First,Let's look at the set of pictures of performance ""The Great Journey"" which was held in celebration of the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China.Come and look at China's 5G, Internet of Things, Cloud Computing, artificial intelligence, spaceships, Navigation Satellite System, and world-class research projects. These technological developments have enabled China to successfully break through the shackles of development and achieve breakthroughs in various aspects from following to leading in this information society.Look at how China's poverty alleviation programs have lifted 100 million people out of poverty, and how can China feed one-fifth of the world's population in self-sufficient way for so many years.What's more, look at how the Chinese government protected its people and restored economic operations and health care at an extremely fast pace when COVID-19 pandemic was raging around the world. In the country with a very transient and numerous population, Chinese people have been highly cooperative with the government's anti-epidemic measures, and the government has made every effort to ensure the safety of the Chinese people as well. China has made remarkable achievements in this regard, which is hard for any other country to match for now.If some people believe that China is just a “paper dragon”, maybe they should not use threats to force China to give up rights which originally belongs to China, and maybe they should not use trade blockade and exclusion to restrict China's growth as well.

The most famous one is the “You can read more about that exercise here:Here’s a summary:The PLA stopped publishing the results of the Stride exercise in 2017, for secrecy reasons. By then, it had published the results of the 3 year period from 2014 to 2017. In that 3 year period, REDFOR (Red team representing China) pretty much lost every engagement except for 2.The OPFOR (blue side) simulating a hybrid of NATO and the armored divisions of peak USSR.So it’s safe to say China’s exercise are as tough and as realistic as it gets. So Beckley’s argument doesn’t have a leg to stand on.Next point:Worried about Chinese students’ high scores on comparative math tests? You’re looking at the curated outputs ofWhereas public school is free through high school in the United States, China’s government only covers the costs of elementary and middle school. At many Chinese high schools, families have to pay tuition and other expenses, and these outlays are among the highest in the world. Consequently, 76 percent of China’s working-age population has not completed high school.Can’t believe this lazy argument ofIs this guy for real? Are you saying the students America sends to International Mathematics Olympiad are not a “highly selected group of students”.Totally not highly selected team members of the American team at the 2019 International Mathematics Olympiad. If the white guy wasn’t there you’d be forgiven to think this is the Chinese team.The top performing country at the International Mathematics Olympiad.But let’s give him to benefit of the doubt, and assume he’s talking about the PISA test score.Yes, China’s score does not represent the whole country, because it was only assessed in 2 provinces and 2 cities.The competition between China and the US is not comparing Guizhou (a poor and landlocked province) With West Virginia (another poor landlocked state). It’s a competition between Silicon valley and Shenzhen, between Shanghai and New York.The rest:Most of the remaining argument revolves the same talking point:Which according to this racialist author “Chinese can’t be creative, Chinese fakes everything blah blah blah”But according to the Nature Index, the most authoritative ranking in Natural Science research prowess. China is ranked a solid 2nd in the world.According to the Nature Index, of the top 50 research institutions and Universities, 12 are in China. Second only to the US.Conclusion:This is just one of many typical China collapse theorist. Their talking points range from coming up with a conclusion first, then use their distorted and ignorant view of the Chinese system to confirm their own biases. It’s basically drawing the target around the arrow.They are also using borderline racist arguments such as “Chinese can’t be creative” as an argument for anything they cannot refute.

Their average education is 13.7 years – largely all of them received an education of high school or above.Another example: “The Chinese military’s first and paramount mission is preserving the power of the Chinese Communist Party against China’s own people. “Concluding remarks like this is far from being accurate to the point of being lies.

When you outspend your competitor in defense, that means you’re more powerful.With that said, I don’t agree that somehow China with a larger GDP is a threat or challenge to the US.

China knew exactly who he was, where he had come from, and where he was going. This makes any attempt to disintegrate China from within doomed to failure. This is why China has survived all the brutal ordeal imaginable and unimaginable in its 5,000 year history, but it has always been able to rise from the ashes just like a phoenix.In fact,Every three hundred years the phoenix runs into the flames and is born from them.The dragon symbolizes the China's power of ""Out of Many, One"", while the phoenix symbolizes China's ability to turn every devastating disaster in history into its own wealth and promote its own evolution.The humiliation of the past century is one of China's most valuable spiritual wealth, which helped China's rapid evolution from a feudal dynasty to a capitalist republic and then to a socialist republic without a stop.That is to say, China has died twice in 100 years, and has also been resurrected twice, just like the phoenix reborn from the ashes twice in 100 years.To return to the title, the history of China is the alternating history of dragon and phoenix.In the dynastic period of great unity, China was a dragon, and ""Out of Many, One"". In the Great Divide Period, China was a phoenix, able to turn its great suffering into the driving force which speeded its own evolution, that is, to bury the old China with fire and tears and then smile to welcome the new China born out of the fire.I believe that in the competition, confrontation and even war between China and the West, China will surely suffer unprecedented defeats, and I also believe that the new China will emerge from the failure.China may be a paper dragon, but the dragon can be reborn like a phoenix.",14 followers,Nathan James,718,8.3K,26.4M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Is-China-a-paper-dragon

Over time this modeling has become more robust to include the affects of materials and surfaces in the scene.These days it's rarely necessary to even consider how those systems work. They are already present in game engines and audio middleware so that we just use it naturally.In Unity we just attach an audio listener to the camera and place audio sources at the source of a sound and boom, 3D positional audio just works.

Everything will work as long as you are consistent.However, just having the world coordinates system is not enough in practice.For example, when you define models that can be placed anywhere in the world, you don't want to define the vertices in world coordinates. Instead, you define a point in the model to be the origin, assume an orientation and scale, and specify the vertices in that coordinate system instead. That's ""model coordinates"". The coordinates are only transformed to world coordinates when the model is actually placed in the world. This allows you to use the same object in many places, instead of having to make a new one every time (and things would get really complicated in that case if objects can move).So world and model coordinates give you convenient ways to define where everything is relative to each other, and also define objects that can be placed anywhere in the world.Then you have camera coordinates. When you actually need to render the world as seen from a camera at a particular point in the world, you need to know where everything is relative to the camera. That's camera coordinates.However, that's not all you need to render something. The camera coordinates (where objects are relative to the camera) are still in 3D, and we have 2D screens (even when you are rendering 3D, by the way), so there needs to be a final transformation that goes from camera coordinates to screen coordinates. Screen coordinates would be like pixels on your screen.",244 followers,Shashank Mudgal,26K,0,0,2015,https://www.quora.com/Is-China-a-paper-dragon

For example, when you create the model using Blender.http://www.blender.org/World Coordinate SystemA Model Coordinate System is the unique coordinate space of the model. Two distinct models, each with their own coordinate systems can’t interact with each other. There needs to be a universal coordinate system that allows each model to interact with each other. This universal system is calledWorld Coordinate System. For interaction to occur, the coordinate system of each model is transformed into the World Coordinate System.Camera Coordinate SystemWhat is seen on a screen, is relative to a viewer. More specifically to a camera. A change in a camera’s orientation and position changes what a viewer sees. A World Coordinate System is transformed into a coordinate system calledCamera Coordinate System. This coordinate space defines what it is seen on a screen.Projective Coordinate SystemWhat is perceived on a screen as three dimensional is just an illusion. It is just a two dimensional image.

16,"Did you have Maths at school? Do you remember those XY graphs you did?Well, that's pretty much what these coordinates are. A graph ""area"" / ""volume"" on which a particular point can be given a specific location. With XY you have 2D, and XYZ ... you guessed it: 3D.To use this coordinate system, you need some ""origin"". E.g. you need a point where the XYZ are all 0. But you also need to know the directions (orientation) - in what direction does the X values grow, and the Z or Y values? Generally you ""choose"" some such point and ""orientation"" for the ""virtual"" world you're modelling. There's otherDid you have Maths at school?

But you also need to know the directions (orientation) - in what direction does the X values grow, and the Z or Y values? Generally you ""choose"" some such point and ""orientation"" for the ""virtual"" world you're modelling. There's other means of stating such coordinates as well, e.g. Polar coordinates work with degrees around origin (referred to as azimuth) and distance to point - this in turn has other variants (e.g. cylindrical may add a height for Z, and spherical may have a 2nd degree ""dimension"" for ""altitude""/elevation). Whatever coordinate system you work with and whatever origin point and orientation you have chosen for the ""environment"" in which you model is referred to as the ""E.g. here's the difference between a left-hand and a right-hand Cartesian coordinate system:Mostly you'd come across the right-hand Cartesian system.Or a spherical coordinate system (Θ or Theta as the angle from the X axis giving the Azimuth measured in this case in a clockwise direction; Φ or Phi as the angle of elevation/altitude from the XZ plane towards the Y axis; and r or radius as the distance/magnitude from the origin):Let's make this simpler ... let's just assume we're working with 3D right-hand Cartesian coordinates:By convention X grows to the right, Y to the top and Z towards you as you look down at the plane defined by XY (i.e. ""outward"" from the page if you draw an XY graph sheet). Note, this isn't a ""rule"", just a convention (e.g. the Unreal game engine has its own ""weird"" convention).LocationWhere is something? This we get from a coordinate point. In 3D space that means 3 values defining how far along any of the 3 axes the point lies.Notice we're viewing the coordinate system at a skew angle? We're not seeing any of the axes (X/Y/Z) direct on. Those graphs from school would be as if we were standing at the top arrow point of that Z axis and looking down, with the X values growing to our right and the Ys growing to the top (i.e. we're looking down at the XY plane). Those axes are just ""chosen"" as some arbitrary point. Where they intersect, we define that ""origin"" point as (X=0; Y=0; Z=0).Notice the cube? That cube is at a specific location. In this case it's coordinates are: (X=10; Y=5; Z=5).OrientationSay the cube above is the viewing point and it's looking at the origin. That would mean everything closer to the origin (or past the origin) is ""in-front"" of it and everything with larger X/Y/Z values is ""behind"" it.To make it easier to understand, say we have a ""character"" in our ""game"" walking towards the origin. The character is 5 feet high, the ground is on the XY plane, and we're viewing (on screen) from her eyes. We can give her a ""local"" coordinate system which makes understanding what's ahead/behind/to the left/etc. a lot less complicated:So now our charcter has her own coordinate system. But to make use of it, we'd need to convert between the word system (WCS) and the local system (LCS).How do we define her LCS? Well, its origin is ""easy"", it's just the point (10,5,5), but what about her oreintation? One way to do that is to define a ""vector direction"" through delta XYZ values (i.e. given one unit distance or vector of one unit length how much does the XYZ values change). In this case such would be (-0.8944, -0.4472, 0). So her LCS is defined as [[10, 5, 5] [-0.8944, -0.4472, 0]] relative to the WCS. That basically gives a vector/direction along her Y axis (or in front of her). Very simplistic, since we haven't defined if she's standing upgright (i.e. Where does her Z point to?) - but let's just assume that for now she's standing upright so her Z vector is (0, 0, 1). So we have a final LCS for her of [[10, 5, 5] [-0.8944, -0.4472, 0] [0, 0, 1]]. That's 3 sets of 3 values - i.e. a sample of what in Maths is referred to as a matrix.In View / NotNow say there's a glass on a table at WCS point (14, -20, 3). Would she see it? To work that out we need to convert it's location in WCS to her LCS. Well, that means we need to apply a bit of maths. We have a WCS (relative to itself) its orentation matrix is [[0, 1, 0] [0, 0, 1]]. And we have a value for the glass as [14, -20, 3] as the value to convert.You'd need to go look for transformation matrixes, cross product and the like. This is a bit of advanced math you'd not have come across in school - so you'd need a bit more ""learning"" here. What you're after is to get an XYZ value of the glass as defined in her LCS. Many game engines have such calcs built-in for you so you may not need to know exactly how to do it - not to mention, the way ""you'd"" do it may not be as optimal as the engine's way.Needless to say, after the calc you get something like this: X = -24.1495     Y = 7.6026     Z = -2.0000Now, from that we can see that the glass is to her left (a negative X), slightly in front of her (a positive Y) and a bit below her eye level (a negative Z). Would she see it? That depends on her visual angle, i.e. where to does her eyes still register something to the sides. At this point you calculate angles - remember trigonometry? Well, a simple way do calculating this would be using those sin/cos/tan functions.The angle to her left calculates as 73 degrees, and downward by 5 degrees. Assuming her visual angle is close to 90 (like normal humans have) then she'd see it ""in the corner of her eye"". Of course in a game, that visual angle is defined by a ""camera"" which may not have such a great angle. This you'd need to calc from your own data.E.g. here I've modelled a cone simulating what her ""eye-camera"" can see if its visual angle is 25 degrees.What if she had a better view angle? Say something closer to a real person? Well, let's try it: I place a camera where her eyes are and adjust its view angle to something in the order of 85 degrees - here's a plan view (i.e. as seen from the top) where I've selected the camera to show to where its view angle extends:And then here's the side 3d view of the same:Notice the glass and table is now inside that volume? She'd now see it right? Well, there's a problem - here's the perspective view from that camera:Notice something strange? That table looks all distorted. Stretched out - not even close to the ""real"" thing. That's because the computer displays it in a 2d image. Our minds interpret the visual stuff our eyes see - which then accounts for such distortion. But when we view the 2d generated thing - those distortion correction functions of our brains don't kick in to gear and we see it exactly the way the camera sees it.Thus with games (especially 1st person perspectives) we have to choose a much smaller viewing angle - to minimize such distortions.","9,994 followers",Brett Bergan,1.3K,7K,83.6M,2015,https://www.quora.com/Is-China-a-paper-dragon
