I think less number of structural engineers will be needed, as a lot of the repetition will be done by machines. But I don't think they will be replaced completely.70 years ago structural engineers designed structures without calculators, let alone computers. They used to perform all calculations using slide rules. It took a long time to analyze an entire building.35 years ago few used computers, most had calculators.

They used to perform all calculations using slide rules. It took a long time to analyze an entire building.35 years ago few used computers, most had calculators. They were able to perform calculations much more quickly, but because of this ability, more detailed calculations were demanded from them.Now we almost always use computers, but we need to perform many checks that were not necessary 35 years ago.As machines become more able, they will speed things up, but we will be required to investigate things we didn't use to. Because the the society will demand safer, more efficient designs.All in all, most of the grunt work will be done by machines, but we will need people to communicate with the computers.",4 followers,Carl Elliott,14K,0,0,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-emerging-civil-engineer-technology-which-India-is-lagging

3,"“China developed faster than India”China used more concrete in three years than the USA did in 100 years of the 20th centuryChina: More cement used in two years than US in 20th centuryWhich means that there are so many buildings, roads, hospitals, toilets, homes, Schools, Recreation centers, i.e. You can’t have a civilization in a Desert.To have a civilization you need Infrastructure. The history of USA begins with revolutions - the rail road connecting the west to east - the inter state highways etc…It is easier to show than to tell. Let me show you a few maps and try to figure out why China“China developed faster than India”China used more concrete in three years than the USA did in 100 years of the 20th centuryChina: More cement used in two years than US in 20th centuryWhich means that there are so many buildings, roads, hospitals, toilets, homes, Schools, Recreation centers, i.e. You can’t have a civilization in a Desert.To have a civilization you need Infrastructure. The history of USA begins with revolutions - the rail road connecting the west to east - the inter state highways etc…It is easier to show than to tell. Let me show you a few maps and try to figure out why China is developing faster than India.Exhibit 1 - USAExhibit 2 - CANADAExhibit 3 - EuropeExhibit 4 - ChinaExhibit 5- IndiaTHE YELLOW LINESDo you see the yellow lines? The yellow lines are six lane express ways - Interstate high speed lines. Do you see how many highways exist in USA? USA is filled with yellow lines - These yellow lines are like high speed - 1GBPS optical fibers laid across the country i.e. I can take my huge truck full of cars from one corner of my country to the other without applying any brakes in full throttle and conduct my business. i.e. SELL;Now COMPARE USA with CANADA.In Canada - Unfortunately only three cities are well connected with Highways - Toronto - Ottawa - Montreal - Qubec city and Nova Scotia - The rest of he nation is a barren waste land - Yes people live there but - they are virtually disconnected - unless they are willing to fly!So is USA better than CANADA - Not Really - USA has a better climate than Canada - If Canada was not the SIBERIA of AMERICAS it would have been filled with mesh of express ways like USA.EUROPE VS RUSSIAThe tale repeats - The most concentration of expressways is in a few countriesNetherlands - Belgium Germany -Denmark - France - Have this tightly knit spider web of express ways - Check them outCHINA vs INDIANow let us take a look at china - They laid so many roads that it is filled with express ways - six lane roadsCompare that with IndiaIndia has only two express ways - For a country of Billion People(1) New Delhi - Agra - Lucknow - The Yamuna Express way - (Vishal Khanna - Thanks for the edit )-(2) Ahmedabad to Vadodara - Barely visible on this mapPAKISTAN - It has one huge expressway connecting - Islamabad - Lahore - Peshawar - Thank to CHINA.What is TRADE?(1) MANUFACTURING AND SERVICES - Development Products (R&D) or People (training)(2) LOGISTICS - The movement of Goods or People(3) SALES AND MARKETING - The art of Selling Goods or PeopleLet us take this simple definition - for practical purposes - There are tons of other factors involved in trade and development - like Imports - Exports - Comparative Advantage - Exchange Rates - Fiscal Policy - Monetary PolicyLet us ignore all of them for a moment - Let us consider internal trade of various countries.The hallmark of a developed country is the ease of trade - The ease of starting a business.If I do not have a place to sit - i.e. to set up shop - Where would I start Manufacturing or Training PeopleIn India - If I wish to set up a factory - I would not have any buildings - I would not find any free space - If I do find a free space - There would be tons of red tape before I can get approvals - If there is no infrastructure to begin with I would not be able to do anything. I visit the local government school and I find that the roof leaks when it rains - does not have a fan in hot summer - is not connected by roads - the roads that are laid - were laid ten years ago and are now filled with pot holes. LOGISTICS i.e. the art of moving goods - there are no roads - There are no air ports - there are no shipping ports. SALES and MARKETING - selling Indian Goods - is pain not just in the ass but all over! You will understand this because - every Indian Good falls short in quality - according to international standards - most of the Indian goods are discarded i.e. thrown away because they don’t fit the requirements set by the buyer. Corruption is not a problem - it never was - Businessmen would earn more profits to pay for the corrupt - but the problem is that the corrupt money is not being used for infrastructure - China is as corrupt as India!What is China Doing?China has many structural advantages compared to IndiaThey are communists - They will kill anyone who stands in the way of the state! They will not hesitate - They will not forgive - They will exterminate ruthlessly.The state is atheist not secular - The state only tolerates religion and culture - mind the word TOLERATES i.e. if the state at any point of time believes that the religion is against the state or any culture is against the state - It will exterminate the religion or the culture. The great cultural destruction during Mao’s era is a proof of the extremes to which Chinese would go!It is a very good thing - China had a clean slate - a fresh slate - a slate cleansed with blood of many people who died during the struggle. China got rid of all the superstitions along with their old culture. India on the other hand lives in these superstitions -China is a COPY PASTE MACHINE - of profit makingChina copies - it copies profit making machines - If a business model is working - they will copy it - They copied Iphone - not just the phone but the Istore - that is an incredible achievement - They copied KFC - They copied McDonalds i.e. in china there is a chain of McDonald stores - not owned by McDonald. They have a copy of facebook - they have a copy of uber - they have a copy of twitter - they have a copy of a copy of a copy i.e. there are other companies trying to make copies of the chinese copies.The entire chinese state understood - the necessity of development - and they are pushing for it at any cost. Most of the chinese cities are covered with smog - but chinese can’t afford to stop their development - They need to make goods - services and sell them to make profits - as long as they make profits they develop.The Chinese are done with roads within their countryThe Chinese are done with RailsThe Chinese are done with PORTS - All these are ports developed by ChinaThe Growth Engine of China owes a lot of its Exports and Export trade is done by ships - not by road or by rail. Globalization happened over Container Terminals, Ports and Oceans - Unfortunately most of Indian - Ports are unfit for Docking International Ships - Hilarious but True - Indians never invested in making their ports world class - Chinese are done with ports not only in their country but also internationally -The Chinese are NOT Done with AIRPORTS YETThe only comparable infrastructure of India with China is in terms of AIRPORTS - India can compete with China on air traffic.But this too will pass - With China building hundreds of airports - by 2020 they will induct more than 100 new airports - to tackle the extreme congestion and delays in air port travel across the nation.I WILL SUM IT UPIndia pales in comparison to China in International PatentsNOTHING CAN BE DONE WITHOUT INVESTMENT IN INFRASTRUCTURE - i.e. utilization of WEALTH to create more WEALTH - which starts a virtuous cycleEquivalent to investing the first twenty years of your life to education - China spent twenty years of its life from 1980 to 2000 in learning about developing profit making machines and investing in them - building cities - tows - roads - railways - and everything and anything in a mad rush to build - sell - repeat;make - sell - repeat; after millions of these selling cycles to international customers - The Country is now reaping the fruits of its investments made decades ago and pursued relentlessly.","1,372 followers",Akilesh Radhakrishnan,4.7K,726,2.2M,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-emerging-civil-engineer-technology-which-India-is-lagging

As an ancient civilization with a history of 5,000 years, it is very difficult and sad to admit that China is backward.During this time, the Chinese humbly welcomed all investments in the world, even those with low technology, high pollution and low economic value.The Chinese government has created numerous special economic zones in the best coastal areas of China to facilitate land use, tax collection, export, employment and firing of workers,The Chinese government has focused its efforts on building large docks, highways, airports, power stations, water facilities, and communications infrastructure to meet the needs of investors who don't have to worry about water shortages, electricity shortages, and transportation costs.The Chinese government and the Chinese people have built the world's largest manufacturing base, the most convenient logistics system and the most complete division of labor in 30 years.Personally, as another ancient civilization of the world, India also needs a major change to change the face of India!","227,241 followers",Gopalkrishna Vishwanath,726,11.9K,117.9M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-emerging-civil-engineer-technology-which-India-is-lagging

It’s not easy to organize fragmented data from multiple sources. To operate efficiently, you’ll need well-curated and timely operations.In a recent study, an estimated $3 trillion goes down the drain annually due to bad data. Therefore, it’s quite imperative that you address this problem early as a company. Luckily, CDPs help to solve this problem by collecting data from all sources. They then organize it, tag it, and make it usable.Device Form FactorsThe current customer needs include small, light, and effective devices. Therefore, manufacturers are heading to the call by providing hybrid devices that double up as phones and tablets. For instance, the Samsung Galaxy Fold 2 does this quite well. 2021 will see a return of stronger and more efficient folding and unfolding devices.Quantum ComputingQuantum computing has helped in the management of COVID-19 in terms of managing the spread, looking for possible vaccines, and the development of therapeutics. As people continue to realize the power of quantum computing, we are more likely to witness its application in many industries in 2021 and beyond.Anywhere OperationsThis IT operating model supports customers everywhere. It also enables employees anywhere in addition to enabling the deployment of business services across distributed infrastructure.Internet of Behaviors(IoB)IoB is an upcoming trend that you’ll hear more of in 2021. Companies and businesses are taking advantage of technology to monitor consumer and customer behaviors. Some of the effective technological tools here include location tracking big data and facial recognition.According to a prediction by Gartner, more than half of the global population will be under an IoB tool by 2025.Total ExperienceOften abbreviated as TX, the total experience goes side by side with the customer experience, user experience, and employee experience. As most of the interactions today are virtual, distributed, and mobile, it’s important to use the TX strategy even more.Already, the COVID-19 pandemic has forced a new norm in collaborations. And that’s why you need to bring together the customers and employees. Intelligent Composable BusinessThis trend focuses on taking advantage of packaged business capabilities. You can develop it through vendors or do it in-house. ICB helps to bring different things together, including better access to changing data, better decision making, and application delivery.Hybrid CloudMost businesses are moving towards the hybrid cloud model. The reason is simple – the hybrid cloud is more convenient. It helps businesses to strike a balance for their distinct cloud infrastructural needs.Most of the giant public cloud providers have started focusing on the hybrid cloud. Some of them include Google Cloud,Oracle, and IBM. All of this aims at dealing with different customer challenges including:Privacy and Confidential ComputingIt involves the encryption of the entire computing process and not only the data. This creates extra layers of security that help to protect sensitive information. We should expect more of privacy and confidential computing in action come 2021.Smart Work from Home TechnologiesThe coronavirus pandemic has shifted the way we do things and carry out business. Initially, it would be radical to allow employees to work from home on a large scale. Even when employees were asking for enhanced work flexibility, it was never to be.The current lockdowns have led to the common acceptance of the work from home formulas. And many pundits argue that this work-from-home policy will outlast the pandemic. We have seen many tech giants extending the work from home flexibility to their staff. Some like Twitter have even given their employees the option of working from home entirely for the rest of their working careers.Part of what made all this a reality is the deployment of smart work from home tools such as WebEx, Zoom, and Microsoft Teams. Such apps have witnessed massive usage over the past few months, and this is expected to continue even in 2021.Artificial IntelligenceAI has continued to improve operations for many companies and businesses. The pandemic even made its usage more common. AI, data, and machine learning have played an unmatched role during this coronavirus period.We have seen how AI has helped in the suggestions customers get when shopping on Amazon, or even when they are watching movies on Netflix. More companies will benefit from AI since the cloud continues to enable access to the rising computing power, software, and frameworks. It’s estimated that 45% of companies using artificial intelligence have increased their total spend per customer, and their ASPs.Hope you like Article.","246,859 followers",Dushka Zapata,1.5K,8.5K,232.5M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-emerging-civil-engineer-technology-which-India-is-lagging
