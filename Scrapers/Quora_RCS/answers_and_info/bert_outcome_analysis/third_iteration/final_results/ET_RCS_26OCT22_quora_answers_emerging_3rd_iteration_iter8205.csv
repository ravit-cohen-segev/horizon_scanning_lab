But that’s generally latency either from the processor to DRAM (because access patterns are too random for hardware prefetching to do much good) or between-node latency (which we solve using very expensive interconnects such as Infiniband).Being “mobile” doesn’t help either of those.

1,"No, the size of modern computation is bounded by power and heat constraints. Most of the volume and weight of a mobile phone is the battery. Switching transistors consumes electrical energy which must be dissipated as heat. Adding more processing power would generally require more power input and more cooling technology (heats sinks and fans like in a workstation). Miniaturisation addresses these problems a little bit over time. However, transistor size is approaching hard physical barriers which will likely halt this trend.(Also the definition of a suNo, the size of modern computation is bounded by power and heat constraints.

Basically, parallel processing involves the breaking up of tasks into smaller tasks that can be processed in parallel. The end result is obtained by combining outputs from each processor.Here is the story of how India’s first-ever indigenous supercomputer was made, a major milestone in modern India’s technological odyssey.The supercomputer effort in India began in the late 1980s, when the US stopped the export of a Cray supercomputer because of continuing technology embargoes. During the 80s, USA and some other European countries had developed super computers, which were critical for developing satellites and nuclear weapons. These countries refused to transfer the knowledge of creating super computers to India, fearing the developing nation might use it to design missiles and warplanes rather than forecast the weather.Faced with a technology-denial regime that denied its scientific community access to supercomputers, India set up Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC) in March 1988 with the clear mandate to develop an indigenous supercomputer to meet high-speed computational needs in solving scientific and other developmental problems where fast number crunching is a major component.Following a specific recommendation of the Science Advisory Council to the Prime Minister (SAC-PM) to that effect, C-DAC was established as a scientific society of the then Department of Electronics (now the Department of Information Technology (DIT) under the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology).To lead the project, PM Rajiv Gandhi turned to a man who hadn’t seen a ‘super’ all his life to build one in double-quick time. But Vijay Pandurang Bhatkar knew all about shortcuts: the country’s top number-cruncher had begun school directly in the 4th standard and still made it to the top. When Rajiv Gandhi met Bhatkar, he asked him three questions:> “Can we do it?”“How long will it take?”“How much money it would take?Pleased, the Prime Minister gave the go-ahead for the project. Based in Pune, C-DAC summoned scientists from all over the country to work on one of India’s greatest technology projects.Within three years, the extraordinary happened. With everyone involved working their socks off, C-DAC finally completed its work well within the proposed deadline. With components that could be bought off the shelves, in 1991, C-DAC rolled out India’s first indigenous supercomputer: PARAM 8000.In pic above: Vijay Bhatkar.For the first time ever, a developing country had pulled off such a feat in advanced computer development. Needless to say, the world was shocked at this achievement. Many were doubtful about PARAM truly being a supercomputer. That’s when Bhatkar decided to take the PARAM prototype to a major international conference and exhibition of supercomputers. Here, it was demonstrated, benchmarked and formally declared a supercomputer. A US Newspapers published the news with headline, “Denied supercomputer, Angry India does it!”A multiprocessor machine, PARAM 8000 was benchmarked at 5 Gflops, making it the second fastest supercomputer in the world at that time. It also costed a fraction of what the legendary US machine Cray did and performed just as well. So much so, that the US company which manufactured Cray had to slash prices to woo a nation it spurned just eight years ago!PARAM 8000 also set the platform for a whole series of high-performance parallel computers, called the PARAM series. In 2002, PARAM 20000, or PARAM Padma, broke the teraflop (thousand billion flops) barrier with a peak speed of 1 Tflop. The latest machine in the series are the PARAM Ishan and the PARAM Kanchenjunga.Installed at IIT Guwahati, PARAM Ishan can be used in the application areas like computational chemistry, computational fluid dynamics, compu...","359,008 followers",Sean Kernan,9.1K,5.6K,727.2M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Are-there-mobile-super-computers-for-just-in-case-communication-latency-overweighs-the-compute-time

The second was that he was willing to burn a lot of power.I heard him speak once at Stanford, just wow. You can study the machine designs yourself.The other factor I know a little about.

The first was that Seymour Cray was a genius of a computer architect. The second was that he was willing to burn a lot of power.I heard him speak once at Stanford, just wow. You can study the machine designs yourself.The other factor I know a little about. The Cray machines were built with emitter coupled logic, which was very very fast, but used a lot of power compared to other circuit designs for logic gates. The transistors in ECL operate in their linear regions and never saturate. This lets them switch very fast, much faster than other schemes, but the downside is that they are always using a constant amount of power, even when just sitting there. ECL designs are usually careful to always have balanced circuits, so when current increases somewhere, it decreases somewhere else, which leads to constant current power supplies.. A third design point is that ECL gates are capable of driving low impedance loads, which lets you arrange the wiring of the computer as transmission lines. You get incident wave switching, which cuts wire delays in half, again at the expense of power.It is a general rule of thumb that you can build a computer with a clock cycle that permits about ten gate delays between clock edges. The Cray 1 ran at 100 MHz, which, more or less, requires 1 nanosecond gates at a time when most people were building computers out of TTL with 10 or 15 nanosecond gates, plus TTLs horrible signal qualities and asymmetric output stages. Schottky TTL was a little faster, but with even worse signalling, because the high switching rates would cause glitches everywhere in nearby high impedance wiring.ECL signalling is usually 50 ohm transmission lines, with beautifully smooth switching transients. A moderate level of discipline among the board designers can get you reliable logic boards without any drama.In the same way that true expert generals study logistics, Cray studied power and cooling, the logistics of computer systems.",214 followers,Chaitanya Sohani,13.7K,0,0,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-are-lesser-known-facts-about-Indias-first-supercomputer

If not then have a look at these pictures.If you are thinking that these images have been edited, then let me tell you one thing: that these are real.Crown shynessThe effect usually occurs between trees of the same species and sometimes between different species.One theory assumes a tree's leaves can feel when they are approaching another tree. Once they sense a nearing neighbor, the growing process halts, ensuring that light can penetrate the canopy and photosynthesis continue.Another possible explanation is that this is a defense mechanism against leaf-eating insects. The gaps mean bugs wouldn't be able to reach other trees, impeding their spread.The next time you're out walking through the forest, take a moment to look above you and you might be pleasantly surprised by what you find.Edit 1: Thanks Robert Taylor for the correction.Edit 2: Thank you all for your love, affection, and kind comments.","45,262 followers",Srinath Nalluri,15.2K,757,85.9M,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-are-lesser-known-facts-about-Indias-first-supercomputer
