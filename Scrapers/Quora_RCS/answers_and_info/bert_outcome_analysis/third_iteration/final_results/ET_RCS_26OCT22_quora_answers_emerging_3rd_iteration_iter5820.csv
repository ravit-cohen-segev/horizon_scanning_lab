You need the actuators to give it the stretch but the suit would fall apart from stress so you need the exotic materials but then you need to power it so you need a power source that generates enough power in a tiny space that doesnâ€™t kill the wearer with radiation and heat, but you canâ€™t fly unless you have repulsors and then you canâ€™t control it because you donâ€™t have the mind interface, but then you are limited in what you can do unless you have the most advanced and complete and benign AI installed but you canâ€™t do that unless you have the computing power that is insanely powerful in a tiny space and none of that matters because a couple hits from physical attacks would turn your body and brain to jelly from the outside shocks so you need electronic inertial dampeners that would put the Enterprise to shame.And thatâ€™s why we canâ€™t have nice things.PS - Iâ€™m sure I missed something. :)",3 followers,Mark Bradford,12.8K,579,2.5M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Which-emerging-technologys-possibilities-excite-you-the-most

2,"In terms of consumers, probably none, but for the developers/manufacturers they can lose a lot of money if the idea of the technology doesn't satisfy a lot of people, i would say windows phone as one of the example but it is not really an emerging technology","358,973 followers",Sean Kernan,9.1K,5.6K,727M,2022,https://www.quora.com/Which-emerging-technologys-possibilities-excite-you-the-most

Jews have been at the forefront of science, technology, medicine, inventions, the arts, economics and social issues for the last 150 years.

We have portable computers with most field-companies, drones overhead, the latest jets in the air and our satellites in the sky.Our tanks are technological wonders. The technology for tanks to fire, at a pin-point target while on the move-at 50 Km/h is made and used in Israel.We have robot boats, tunnel -destroying technology and face-recognition cameras in most â€˜hot-spotsâ€™.The technology to shoot down enemy rockets-while in the air-over the enemy side of the fence is made in Israel and well applied.Our computerized and radarized anti-â€˜car-crashâ€™ system is now sold all around the world.In medicine, We have the latest technologies and we have developed many of them.The simple facts that Google, and many other high-tech companies have R&D centers in Israel â€”and that the second â€˜Silicon Valleyâ€™ concept is found in Israel-is a reflection of â€˜advanced-technologicallyâ€™ Israel.â€¦and the local joke: â€œ Why donâ€™t they move theIsraelThe acute distance between the scientific/technological Israel and all her Arab neighborsâ€¦is astounding.

5,"Occumetics bionic lensYes. Iâ€™ve been waiting patiently. Iâ€™m still waiting.Image source:The Occumetic bionic lens was predicted to be released on the market in 2017 but as of April 2019, theyâ€™re back in for pre-clinical and clinical trials. Iâ€™ve been waiting since early 2016 for these bad boys.I looked into Lasik and even went so far as to get a consultation but they can only guarantee results for two years and repair a couple of the issues. ðŸ˜¥The Bionic LensOccumetics bionic lensYes.

6,How many jobs will involve using technology? Close to 100%How many will require a person to understand the technology?

7,Technology has been taking jobs for over 200 years. But so far we keep developing new ones.We have been automating stuff for a long time. From the time of the first steam engine in the late 1700s. Imagine all the workers that were displaced who tended the horses that powered the water pumps.All the weavers displaced from all the powered looms in the early 1800s.And so forth.,UNKNOWN,Denis O'Sullivan,902,68,362.2K,2021,https://www.quora.com/Which-emerging-technologys-possibilities-excite-you-the-most
