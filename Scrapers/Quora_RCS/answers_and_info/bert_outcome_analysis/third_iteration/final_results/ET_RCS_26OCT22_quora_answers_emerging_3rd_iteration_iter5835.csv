Most don’t go forward with the next steps of starting a company.Most first time entrepreneurs get caught up and don’t actually grow.They expect a mentor or coach to do the work for them.First time entrepreneurs need to know that there isn’t a magic box or person with all the answers.Your path to success will be different than someone else’s.Finding your own way is part of the journey.Though having a great mentor can help, you can’t expect them to do the work for you.The watch strap I invented!",0 followers,Dhiva Gar,1.2K,0,0,2018,https://www.quora.com/Which-one-of-the-following-factors-is-against-the-European-Union-as-emerging-as-a-super-power-geopolitical-power-technological-power-geographical-power-or-military-power

Brin and Page are young, smart and ambitious, and they’re the founders, which doesn’t apply to the leadership of Apple and Microsoft. I explain the importance of thisIn Google’s early days, they set out to dominate search without knowing how they’d make money. AdWords wasn’t as obvious then as it is now. But Brin and Page knew all along that if they could dominate search they’d monetise somehow.And that has been how they’ve approached everything they’ve gone into. They don’t care about the money as the money will eventually come when they dominate.Chromebook, Android, Google Docs, YouTube, Gmail, their leadership in self-driving cars are all seeds that Google have planted, that will make them huge returns at some point. They’re patient.I mean, despite going in well after Apple into the smartphone arena, they now run 82% of the world’s smartphones. An absolutely incredible achievement. They knew this was a space they had to dominate at whatever short-term cost.
