If they turned around and burned all remaining propellant, it wouldn’t slow them down by more than a percent or so. They used a big rocket to get going that fast, and multiple planetary slingshots to boost back up to speed as the sun’s gravity slowed them down. They aren’t coming back unless some Vogon destructor fleet picks them up on its way here.","35,157 followers",C Stuart Hardwick,1.2K,12.3K,143M,2017,https://www.quora.com/Is-it-possible-that-in-the-future-we-can-have-a-spacecraft-that-goes-faster-and-overtake-Voyager-1-Same-goes-with-advancing-technology-in-far-future

2,"Of course. Voyager used a particularly good positioning of orbits of the larger planets, but it’s purpose was to pass those at a speed at which good observations could be done, especially considering the limitations of instruments at that time.It would have been quite possible to achieve a faster speed but would have been counter-productive. We could launch a craft now that would pass it, but why would we go to that bother?

4,"The speeds of Voyager 1 were not constant the whole time it has been travelling away from the earth. It was launched with so much speed by powerful rockets and has had to fight the pull of first earth and then the sun slowing it down. It was able to use some clever slingshot maneuvers to increase its speed around Jupiter,Saturn, Uranus and Neptune as a gravity assist as it blew by those planets in a rare and convenient alignment.Still with a speed well above solar escape velocity it is clearly leaving the solar system at a brisk pace for most human projects.We are not at the limit of our speedThe speeds of Voyager 1 were not constant the whole time it has been travelling away from the earth.

Voyager has satisfied many of the questions about very deep solar system conditions; there’s not much out there to really see, and its really way too slow to get to another solar system in any reasonable time even if we were to go 10 times as fast.",UNKNOWN,Robert Frost,1.9K,9.4K,195.6M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Is-it-possible-that-in-the-future-we-can-have-a-spacecraft-that-goes-faster-and-overtake-Voyager-1-Same-goes-with-advancing-technology-in-far-future

When I heard the doctor tell her “six months”, it felt likeI met my wife, Jess, twenty-one years ago when she was nineteen.Our parents owned side-by-side cabins in the northern part of New York and we both happened to be along for the week-long hunting trip our fathers planned that year.Jess' father was a skilled hunter and could hit a headshot from a mile away — same as my dad.Jess and I didn't hunt with them — we hung out by the lake.The moment I saw Jess I fell in love. We've been together ever since.But now, now that she has an expiration date, I just don't know what to do — I'm scared and lost.Monday morning at work I was telling my best friend and supervisor, Timmy, about my wife's condition. Timmy told me that I.T. or Intelligent Terrestrial just came out with their latest models.These models are different than those of yesteryear because they are 52% mechanical and 48% biological.Timmy said all you have to do is mail a sample of DNA to I.T. and upload a digital copy of your consciousness through an app. You can then purchase a custom made clone at an age of your choice. When the clone arrives it will turn on, study it's surroundings and await a consciousness download.“Oh my God Timmy, what's the catch?”“The price, Leon.”When I got home from work, Jess and I plugged in and uploaded a digital copy of our entire conscious catalog to I.T. and then mailed off DNA samples.Jess asked me what age I wanted her to be. It felt awkward to say “twenty”, but I did it — I was honest. I miss her smooth, youthful skin and I want her to be young and healthy — especially if I have to cash my entire 401K in to afford it.We told her parents that we were going to basically bring her back from the dead and her father threatened to shoot any abomination that we brought into this world.One month later, on a day that Jess was particularly ill, the doorbell rang.Jess and I dragged the box through the door and laid it on the living room floor. I gently cut along the lines and when I opened the flaps, there,she,was.The last time my heart fluttered like this was the day I met her.Jess helped me lift I.T. out of the box and sit I.T. up.I.T. was warm and soft. I.T. was mine. I paid for I.T. I own I.T.Machines like this don't have rights — even though they are part biological, the governments recognize them in the same way they would a lawnmower — so, as I said, I.T. is my possession.The science behind uploading a digital consciousness is so cutting edge, that the laws just haven't caught up yet.Jess turned I.T. on and I.T. looked right into my eyes. I was in love — with two women, but, it was the same woman. We hadn't uploaded Jess' consciousness yet, so, I.T. was running on basic programming, but I.T. was gorgeous.Jess asked me what I wanted to do, and for the first time in a very long time — I lied to her.I told her we should go shopping and buy I.T. some clothes.I.T. doesn't seem to have a personality yet.“Hello…. Smile…”Jess picked outfits for both of them and we went for a walk through the park together. It was amazing — I was so happy.We walked down a cozy little trail and found a tuck away to sit and talk.I.T. watched and studied every move Jess and I made. I.T. was learning and adapting.I.T. was becoming aware.At one point Jess and I got distracted and I.T. wandered off. When we found I.T., I.T. was gazing at the sky.I asked I.T. what it was doing. I.T. said, “Where do I come from?”“You come from Heaven. You are my angel.”That answer seemed to work for I.T. We all walked back to the car and headed home.When we got home, Jess immediately started coughing. She fell to the ground and I tried to help her, but I didn't know what to do.Jess passed away right then. It was finally over.I called her family and the police. It took an hour for them to remove the body. I had Jess 2.0 sitting in my back room waiting for them to leave.After the police left, I plugged I.T. into my laptop and downloaded Jess' consciousness.After the download was complete, we walked outside and I looked into her gigantic brown eyes. I asked her, “Is it you, Jess?”She smiled and said, “It is, silly — now kiss me.”Her head slammed back. I didn't know if she was glitching or what and then I heard a bang and saw a hole above her left eye.My beautiful Jessica died twice today. I was crushed.Over the next two decades, I fell into a deep, dark, alcohol-fueled depression. Although I had developed a serious alcohol problem, I was able to work and save every single penny I earned.After twenty years of saving, I decided I wanted both of them back — the twenty-year-old Jess and the forty-year-old Jess.I sent my entire life savings off to I.T. and in one month, my doorbell rang.I cut the box open and wept when I saw my angel(s).I turned them on.I also clothed them. The younger version of me may have left them in the nude, but at this age, I just want my companion(s) back.The ladies helped me back to my room to lay down. I was so tired from all the excitement.I've waited and worked an entire lifetime to be with the woman I love. And now, at long last — she is beside me.I died, on that very night as a happy man.One day later, the doorbell rang. It seems my beautiful Jessicas used my direct deposit life insurance benefit to make a purchase.They gently cut the box open.And turned me on.You ask where technology will be in 2050?We will be everywhere.LeonSpecial thanks:Cameron — Dear friend.

7,"The main difference is that we’d be able to fit better sensors in a lower weight, and possibly lower power requirements. Considering that Voyager was initially planned to only last 3 years, maybe we would have increased the number of sensors until the whole package was as heavy as it is now, or maybe we would have used the lower power load to make it with a smaller load of plutonium and had a lighter and faster spacecraft. But it’s hard to argue with the success of a spacecraft that was designed for 3 years that has lasted as long as it has.",UNKNOWN,Viktor T.
