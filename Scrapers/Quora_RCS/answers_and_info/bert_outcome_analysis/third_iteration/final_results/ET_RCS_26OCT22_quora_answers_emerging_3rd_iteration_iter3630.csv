2,Spoken like someone who has never had cancer. In the past a cancer diagnosis was a death sentence. I think many people still think that the minute they hear the word. The truth is that many cancers are curable if they are caught early. Some are lucky and get cures when they are diagnosed late. It is really a crap-shoot. Cancer is tricky and not easy to get rid of. It is perfectly normal to cry and be upset when you get that sort of diagnosis. It is the normal human reaction to something that could and might kill you. I am one of the lucky ones so far.

You see, that’s a big reason for fighting. When I was diagnosed, a colleague of mine told me, “if you were diagnosed 10 years ago, you’d probably be dead by now.” The point is to live long enough to make it to the next breakthrough and possibly a cure.I wish good luck to your friend and as her friend, I urge you to support her and encourage her.

Annnnd there you have it!Two weeks ago, I got home from a run, got into the shower and started peeing (as all civilized humans do). Looking down at my yankee-doodle, I noticed what looked like fresh squeezed pink grapefruit juice (no pulp please, which, stick a pin in that, we’ll come back to it). I wrote it off as a one-off occurrence likely caused by dehydration from the heat and my long run (about six miles).Next day, I ran again, jumped into the shower but THIS TIME, my husband was physically in the bathroom. Also this time, I peed what looked like tasty and delicious cherry Kool-Aid with a touch of the aforementioned “pulp” which was rather concerning (see: I almost passed out). My husband took a peek (he’s an ICU nurse, FWIW) and that got me a quick appointment with my urologist. I went in, pissed in a cup and that brings us to this past Tuesday when the nurse, clearly frantic and hiding it, called me to make an “urgent” phone appointment with the doctor.[Side note medical people: you’ve gotta’ work out a system. I don’t overly care as I knew the moment the appointment was made that something was wrong because over the past ten years we went from, “Nothing over the phone, ever, no matter what,” to “We will tell you over the phone if you’re okay but we’ll schedule an appointment if it’s worrisome,” which, again, I’m fine with but you aren’t doing any favors this way.]So, the doctor called. He informed me that they tested the cells twice and they came back looking like a particularly aggressive form of bladder cancer. We cried a lot that night. Clearly, this sucks. (Please, if you’re gonna respond, don’t. Look. I get it, when we read harrowing news, we want to chip in with good vibes, inspirational quotes, statistical analysis, or that you’ll pray to your deity to try to intervene on my behalf — that’s cool. I accept all good comments in the spirit in which they are given, but I’ve got plenty and I’m not the kind of guy whose mood is lifted by people chiming in with heartwarming comments. Ribald jokes would be preferred at this point. Questions are welcome.)I went in Wednesday of this week to get “cystoscopy” which is basically a large hose shoved up my dick-hole and into my bladder. The nurse, whose exceptionally stunning Indian princess looks were utterly wasted on me, had to prep me. That was fun. She had a great sense of humor and I just don’t care who fiddles with my wedding tackle from a “shame” standpoint — it’s either this or a toe-tag so, I’ll take “this” over the permanence of death.Joking around with her, I told her, “Hey. You’re in luck. I shaved my balls today.” Which was probably the best timedA fucking fire hose. That goddamned probe was a fucking fire hose that I’m certain they dipped in honey, glass shards and lemon juice because after the lido wore off … lava. Pure, molten hot lava. Anway, we’re getting ahead of ourselves. I’m not exceptionally gifted in the department down below and the sight of a long tube about as thick asTherein, I have a very small fissure? Spot? The word he used escapes me at this point. (LESION!!! Thanks“How are you feeling?”Numb. Physically, I’m 100% fine a bit tired all the time. Slight achy lower back, some slight trouble expelling urine, but I’m up and about doing things. Emotionally? I’m just numb. Maybe I’m a mac-daddy (probably not) and have simply digested this and adjusted accordingly. I’m inclined to doubt that fact as this is big news and it’s not impossible to have processed and accepted it, it’s just unlikely for now. It’s likely that this window of numbness is something bequeathed to all of us by our evolutionary inheritance — we can accept bad news of even the worst variety and compartmentalize to tend to our affairs.My friend“How’s Rick?”Awful. Amazing. Inconsolable. Perfect.This is the part that is the hardest and it’s the part that even now, has tears running down my face. I get asked a question by people all the time, “Is that real?” My husband and I have a strange relationship. We don’t bicker or fight but on the rarest of occasions. He’s everything, my entire world. Him on one side of a oldey timey libra and the rest of humanity, all lives that have ever lived, every building, every life, every animal and indeed, all of existence in its entirely would not compare. They’d be violently, through lever forces, flung from the device and into the non-existent ether that was sacrificed at the foot of his life and its importance to me.He’s distraught. He thinks he’s witnessing the death of his husband. I put myself in his shoes. He just lays next to me, hugging me with every drop of his energy until he can’t hold any longer. He will take a lot of work, regardless of how much time I have left on the planet, which I hope is for a long time, but I have few doubts will be as long as we’d both like.“What next?”CT scan on Monday. I go to Cleveland for two weeks next Thursday to see my family. It’s early stage. Bladder cancer is one of the most treatable cancers there is and it is usually caught early (as mine was) due to how quickly we noticed something is off (blood in urine). I have an appointment with another urologist scheduled while I’m in Cleveland just as a second opinion. Then we return here and treatment begins. I’ve taken medical leave from my job (a job I love) to best focus on this challenge.If ever I doubted my career choices, this convinces me I did the right thing. Between the compensation protection and the benefits I get, I realize now that this was the best possible choice I could’ve ever made.The money shot.EDIT","1,121 followers",Ann Silberman,971,381,2.8M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Why-do-many-people-cry-when-they-are-diagnosed-with-cancer-when-we-live-in-a-time-when-we-have-advanced-technology-that-should-make-cancer-treatment-as-easy-and-painless-as-possible

It indicates you are aware this is an area you can get better at — which is the best thing about it.Mental strength (also referred to as mental toughness) is theIt is alsoIn other words, it’s a big deal.Developing and improving mental strength is no small task. It’s not something you get to check off a list at the end of the day. It takes time. It also requires you to push yourself outside your comfort zone in situations where you cannot protect yourself, can’t complain about everything that’s happening to you, can’t run back to a place that’s familiar.Working on your mental strength takes guts.The benefits, however, are priceless to your personal growth and the quality of your life. Mental strength will help you deal with life, other people (in your professional, personal, and social interactions), challenging situations at school or work. The sooner you start working on it, the faster you’ll notice the results.Here are five ways to improve mental strength.#1. Train yourself to nurture a growth mindset.Carol Dweck, professor of psychology at Stanford, wrote a book calledHow can you do it?Shift your focus from the end result (making straight A’s in school or getting a promotion at work) to the actual process of becoming successful. A growth mindset person doesn’t think that success is being the best — they believe success is#2. Use every obstacle you encounter to your advantage.How often have you told yourself,How can you do it?In his book#3. Don’t resist unexpected situations; go with the flow.It’s a normal thing to encounter unexpected situations in life. More often than not, our week takes a different turn from what we imagined it would be. You think you have two full weeks to complete a project and then suddenly your co-worker tells you there are actually three days to finish everything. You meet a friend for coffee and what you thought would be an enjoyable chat turns into several hours of complaining about their relationship. You’re proud of yourself for paying off your credit card debt and then a forgotten bill that’s past due shows up out of nowhere. Regardless of the situation, the last thing you should do is let your emotions take over. It’s better to go with the flow, even if it feels uncomfortable.How can you do it?Step one is to be aware of your thoughts and emotions as you’re reacting to the unexpected event. The thoughts might sound something like this.#4. Practice self-discipline daily.There’s something about the words “self-discipline” that upsets people. For me, self-discipline is a positive thing. It’s about focusing my energies on an outcome I want — to increase my writing skills, improve my physical strength, or keep myself on track with a new habit that will make me feel proud. What’s at the core of self-discipline? It’s knowing how to postpone things that are more pleasurable and take care of the essentials first. This practice actually yields long-term benefits. In a study performed by Stanford University scientists called theHow can you do it?Start by observing the things you’d like to indulge in whenever the opportunity presents itself — for example, when you see a tempting dessert in the bakery or candy section of your grocery store. Resist the temptation to immediately pick it up and put it in the basket or cart. Instead, think of one reason why you shouldn’t buy it: maybe you’re starting off the month with new fitness goals or better eating habits. And it’s important to follow up — take your attention away from the distraction and focus on your priorities for the day. Go for a short workout like a bike ride or quick run, complete your homework, or listen to a podcast.#5. Repeat today, tomorrow, and the day after.Mental strength doesn’t just appear in your life one day, nor does it have an expiration date. That said, it is important to keep up the progress you're making over an extended period of time. What’s the point of doing something meaningful this week and then letting yourself go the following week or month? If you do that, you’ll lose momentum, get complacent or just plain lazy, even worse — you’ll forget how confident you felt when you overcame that initial obstacle. That’s why it is critical to keep at it and hold yourself accountable every step of the way.How can you do it?Be smart with your time — plan everything out.

Essentially, being mentally strong helps us process the world — and our role in it — better.I wouldn’t say that my way of developing mental strength is necessarily unique. It’s more a matter of understanding what I need at this point in my life, which skills I need to work on more, and which habits I want to incorporate into my day so I can get better at those skills.Here are three habits I’ve been practicing to develop mental strength.✅ Mental strength building habit #1. Riding with the turbulence.It’s nothing unusual to encounter unexpected situations in life. Granted, the current situation with the pandemic and COVID-19 is definitely something out of the ordinary, but it’s not the first time I have encountered a turbulent time. We’ve all been there in the past. We study for an exam, yet when exam day comes we aren’t able to concentrate and this affects our final grade. We get laid off from work or find a new job that turns out to be worse than the previous one we’ve had. We spend more time working from home and have to homeschool our siblings or children because they, too, are stuck indoors during the pandemic. Everyone is nervous because our lives have been disrupted. What is something we should be aware of? It’s important not to let emotions take over our whole day, whether they are feelings of sadness, anger, helplessness, or frustration. It will actually benefit us more if we go with the flow, and take things day by day.How can you do this?Step one is to be aware of the thoughts that are running through your mind as you’re reacting to the unexpected event. The thoughts might sound something like this.✅ Mental strength building habit #2. Seeing obstacles in a new light.If we’re really honest about it, there are obstacles we run across every single day of our lives. Some are really small ones, like running out of laundry detergent just when we realize we have no more clean clothes left to wear. Others are bigger ones, like not being able to pay bills at the end of the month because those textbooks we had to purchase last week were more expensive than we anticipated. And then there are all those obstacles in between — road construction that’s slowing down traffic, being late to a meeting, a difficult landlord, friends who demand our time and want to party, or maybe that box of cookies calling your name right when you’ve decided you want to lose ten pounds and go back to your fitness regimen. In all of the cases, what do we typically do? We blame the obstacles for not “allowing” us to achieve a short or long-term goal. But what if obstacles were to serve a different purpose in our life? Instead of using them as an excuse to avoid something or even quit something, we can use them to our advantage.How can you do this?There’s a cool hack for overcoming obstacles that I read in the book✅ Mental strength building habit #3. Growing my mindset.There is one book that has completely changed the way I think about the capabilities of the human brain. It is calledTo apply this way of thinking to the present challenges we are facing around COVID-19, having a fixed mindset can mean we see the world completely out of our control. Governments are in power, presidents can “save” or “destroy” the population of their country depending on the decisions and laws they put into effect. And we, the regular people, just react — no choices, no decision-making is up to us. We merely receive — the news, changes in laws, restrictions, you name it. And that way of thinking can make us feel powerless. It’s exactly what we should avoid. Here’s where having a growth mindset can prove helpful.How can you do this?Shift your focus from awfulizing about the global health crisis to identifying something that is within your control and that you can work on every single day. Instead of reading the news on Twitter for hours and getting more anxious by the minute, you can find one area of your life that you can improve and that has a positive side effect of making you feel better about yourself. For example, you can dedicate 30 minutes a day to practice a skill. Go on YouTube and learn how to bake bread from scratch. Take that book that’s been sitting on your shelf for months and read the first chapter. Take 15 minutes early each morning to take a brisk walk outside to get some daylight and also produce more endorphins (your “happy” hormones).Remember —",18 followers,Asim Qureshi,2.9K,996,155.9M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Why-do-many-people-cry-when-they-are-diagnosed-with-cancer-when-we-live-in-a-time-when-we-have-advanced-technology-that-should-make-cancer-treatment-as-easy-and-painless-as-possible

My daughter, Maryam, who was 11, also got an A* - they studied together.And not only did they get an A*, the highest grade, if there was an A*+++ they would have got that - I mean they clearMy son, who was 9 at the time, got an A* in his Physics IGCSE (UK 16+ exams).To give some perspective for those unfamiliar with the UK’s IGCSE, it is usually a two year course, which is usually started after around 8 years of prior study.So Danyal, my son, might be the youngest person in the world to have achieved an A* in a Physics IGCSE.

Understand it and it’s piss easy. I mean there is hardly anything to actually know - for most physics exams they give you all the formulas - you just need to understand how the formulas work.Ok, so here’s how they did it…We didn’t use any syllabus or textbook, apart from for reference. So,For each question, when they got stuck, which at the beginning was pretty much all the time, they’d look it up in a textbook, and if they still didn’t understand I’d explain it. They then moved on to the next question, and by doing question after question they eventually understood all the concepts. It helps a lot that the answers to all the exam questions are readily available. By referring to those they got an amazing sense of what the examiners were looking for.This simply answering question after question is essentially how I was taught physics at Oxford University, so it’s not some crazy new system. The benefit of this is that all learning is done with a purpose – which is to answer the question at hand – and that makes one focused and it also sticks in one’s mind.In terms of time, they started off with an hour a day, after about a month it rose to around 2–3 hours a day. A month before the exam they spent around 5 hours a day, 7 days a week.So physics is piss-easy if you know how to study and put in the time. It’s all a matter of doing past papers fairy intensively. Forget lectures and going through a textbook.","5,990 followers",Jens Böttiger,566,2.6K,17.6M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Is-there-any-evidence-of-a-lost-superior-technologically-advanced-human-civilization-that-destroyed-themselves
