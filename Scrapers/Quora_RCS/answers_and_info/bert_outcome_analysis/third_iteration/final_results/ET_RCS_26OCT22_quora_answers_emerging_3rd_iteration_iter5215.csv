There is a lot more to being a soldier than just shooting a gun (we do have a robots capable of that). This applies both physically (being able to traverse terrain, manipulate objects, etc) and to other tasks like interacting with the local populace to win hearts and minds.No.We don't currently have any robot that is versatile enough to do everything a soldier does.

They will simply become another enabling technology. Vehicles and tanks are valuable assets, but after a hundred years of use they still haven't replaced dismounted infantry.",36 followers,Adam Ambrozy,579,0,0,2015,https://www.quora.com/Is-todays-technology-able-to-build-robots-which-can-replace-professional-soldiers-in-the-event-of-war-If-no-what-technology-is-lacking

The rise of fintech has forever changed the way companies do business. The traditional model of a new business turning directly to its local high street bank and/or a conventional investor is no longer the only game in town.From crowdsourcing to mobile payments, there has never been as much choice to entrepreneurs as there is presently. It’s never been cheaper to not only set-up your business, but also to expand it. The rise of the smartphone has massively changed the behaviour of consumers. Thanks to the ‘always online’ culture we live in today – and the proliferation of services and apps that feed it – people can not only access information and data they had never previously been able to, they can do so whilst waiting for a bus.Whether it’s checking their online account or setting up an online investment portfolio, people now expect to handle financial affairs as easily and conveniently as they do their email or Facebook page. It’s a huge opportunity for businesses and soon no enterprise will succeed and flourish without the right fintech services in place.Employees in financial services probably feel particularly threatened because several major areas of the industry are already seeing considerable changes to jobs due to technology:","135,539 followers",Hector Quintanilla,3.1K,1.2K,88.6M,2017,https://www.quora.com/Is-todays-technology-able-to-build-robots-which-can-replace-professional-soldiers-in-the-event-of-war-If-no-what-technology-is-lacking
2,"No, technology replacing a teacher is a horrible idea. It about guarantees that many students will get less out of the course if there is no human interaction. For one, it becomes much easier to cheat if you are working online.

Even in online courses, we find that it is important for teachers to give lectures, whether in the form of videos, lessons, Skype sessions, etc. It is important that we remember that the teacher is more than just a facilitator of knowledge. An instructor also acts as a guide, mentor, and inspiration for students, a role that no technology can replace. Keeping in mind important skills like decision making, time management, etc., a child needs a teacher because the technology does not teach these human skills.","220,612 followers",Franklin Veaux,1.7K,47.3K,782.9M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-is-financial-technology-fintech-and-what-jobs-will-it-replace

5,"Technology has added a remarkable dimension to the modern classroom - but the first purpose of a teacher in a classroom is to keep safe order.

6,"Technology is not the panacea. My father, an immigrant from pre-WWII Germany taught me about how to use Socratic Reasoning. Using a Q&A format, he would challenge my views and force me to think critically about and defend my concepts and those I had read. This method was NOT being used in my high school in the 60’s. Even outside of my assigned school work he made me read the classics and taught me public oration skills by reciting famous speeches like FDR’s Declaration of War and made me listen to and gain a deep appreciation for classical music and opera.He was an astute observer of what hadTechnology is not the panacea.

Even outside of my assigned school work he made me read the classics and taught me public oration skills by reciting famous speeches like FDR’s Declaration of War and made me listen to and gain a deep appreciation for classical music and opera.He was an astute observer of what had happened in Germany after WWI and the environment that enabled Hitler his National Socialists to come power. He kept detailed journals (in German) and shared those with me as he taught me his native language. Most disturbing to me was what he told me did NOT match with what I was learning in school. Either he was wrong, or the history books were wrong. Now the tables were turned, and I forced him to defend his observations and statement. He did and quite effectively. This was the age before technology so, as father and son, we'd go off to the library; you recall what those were don’t you? Microfiche newspaper articles and reference volumes became our main research sources and not questionably biased web sites.The Socratic reasoning method I learned from my father was a very popular teaching style in US colleges until after WWII, when the influences of the Frankfurt schoolers took over and teaching became lecture based rather than (Socratic) discussion-based. Lecture-based teaches WHAT to think, (Socratic) discussion based teaches HOW to think. The difference is like night and day (i.e., left brain right brain) for young impressionable minds. It is extremely rare to find colleges in America today (outside of law schools) that are dedicated to the classic Socratic style of exploratory (not explanatory) teaching.Can technology reproduce these experiences? Can technology like Artificial Intelligence (AI) interact “intelligently” with humans like my father did with me? Can it reproduce a Socratic Q&A style that does not introduce political, social or cultural bias like human professors do in their current lecture-based formats? Students everywhere are routinely taught how to arrange pieces of information by educators who are unaware of elementary pieces of information that are well-designed to be easily arranged. I see that as a huge disaster for any attempt at technological implementation. How would you ever be able to implement AI to teach physics or mathematics?I recently retired from the Defense industry. I worked on advanced decision, command and control systems that used software agents and relied on first-order logic, ontologies and controlled taxonomies to support primitive forms of AI. One of the programs I was familiar with was Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI). It is one of a handful of recent (maybe still current) DARPA programs that are hoping to enable what they call third-wave AI systems – apparently AI comes in “waves” and not generations. These systems are where machines ""understand"" the context and environment in which they operate, and over time build underlying explanatory models that allow them to characterize real world phenomena, This is sort of what the human brain does, at least in semi-normal people. This XAI architecture would support the requirement for the AI agent to have a constructive dialog with the human; to be what technologists call human aware. Is this the future technological teaching architecture?Human-aware AI agents need to exhibit behavior that is ""explicable"" to the humans and be ready to provide ""explanations"" where needed. ‘Explanation’ has always been possible with inference engines driven by theories. In those circles, we have called ‘explanation’ “proof”, just as logicians and philosophers have for two thousand years.Computer hardware would provide the physical layer for AI agents. But computers are physically architected in an hierarchy of layers; computer languages are also organized in a hierarchy of layers; and classiﬁcation schemes and taxonomies (and indeed, ontologies) are organized as a hierarchy of layers. Could there be one ideal linearly recursive straight-line integration of this entire framework across all these levels?But then we face the specter of Technological Singularity that, according to such intellectual luminaries as Stephen Hawking and Elon Musk have expressed concern that fully realized AI artificial intelligence could result in human extinction. Or Ray Kurzweil, who has predicted that the “Singularity” could occur as soon as 2025. Then again, the man who invented the internet and discovered Global Warming said that by 2012, North America would be a frozen wasteland.I could write volumes, but I’ll leave you with this: ideas rule the world. We need to understand ideas and we need to be able to accurately categorize them as good ones, bad ones, confused ones, crazy ones. Why, Socrates asked? Your turn to answer.","1,611 followers",Thanos Papangelis,1.5K,0,0,2019,https://www.quora.com/Is-todays-technology-able-to-build-robots-which-can-replace-professional-soldiers-in-the-event-of-war-If-no-what-technology-is-lacking
