1,"For me, there is really no one platform that speaks with 100% accuracy. What I do is read articles from different news outlets and technology websites. With the uprising of hoaxes and false news statements, what do I do with it? I read it as it contains an interesting topic to research more on. This helps develop my own knowledge and keeps my curiosity in check. There are a lot of big news outlets that publish similar content. The small outlets and credible blogs help too. It becomes a daily habit of mine when I have my lunch break and it really helps keep me informed.",179 followers,Tony Moir,684,403,2.5M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Whats-the-most-accurate-and-useful-platform-for-news-about-emerging-technologies

He said it wasn’t something he was interested in doing and gave me the phone numbers for a couple other plumbers who might be willing to help.It took me a week and a dozen phone calls to get the job done properly. It turned out to be four manhours of work. The parts couldn’t have cost $20.The trades are alive and well. Baby Boomers are retiring in droves and leaving their high paying jobs unfilled.

And that’s not the first time by a long shot. I have also spent many nights, staying up late reviewing drawings to keep my staff employed. My days and nights ar not filled with the creative design time I though would await me upon graduation. Today, I truly believe I spend less than 5% of my days doing what I was trained to do in University. It’s a profession that demands a lot of you, and you need a passion for design and building beyond what most people can comprehend.It’s a tough profession. But it’s a rewarding profession, too.

He could talk sports, politics, science… all the while making it seem like you were old friends.The thing we shared is that we didn’t rush people, we didn’t judge them as potential good or bad tippers, we didn’t make them feel like they were an inconvenience or that we were just ‘doing our job.’We both genuinely like people.Serving is a difficult job and it’s not for everyone. It’s fast paced, you have to multi-task… and some peeps are just plain jerks who don’t care if you have 5 other families that also require your attention. One of the main skills you need as a server is the ability to hide all that stress behind a happy face, so your tables can enjoy their meals without feeling guilty for asking for extra napkins.End of day, I worked about 35 hours per week and made about $24 per hour. I don’t know if you consider that ‘good money’ but… I wasn’t on call 24/7, I wasn’t required to work 50 hours per week (on salary, no overtime) and I met a heck of a lot more interesting people than I do as a manager.A good server can make decent money.

It took me twelve years on the job to make those kind of wages. Before that, I hacked my way though a decade of hourly gigs, salaries in the $20,000 range, freelance payments that were always late and too little.It's a hard business.
