1,"The vast majority of private equity acquisitions today are represented by investment bankers so you keep in touch with bankers and they’ll feed you deal flow. It’s not the best (read: cheapest) way to buy a company but that’s how it is today and that goes for lower middle market all the way up to mega front page news deals. When I first got into the business there were many more off market deals where you’d network around specific industries and approach management/ownership but bankers have become involved in almost every deal today.

It’s not the best (read: cheapest) way to buy a company but that’s how it is today and that goes for lower middle market all the way up to mega front page news deals. When I first got into the business there were many more off market deals where you’d network around specific industries and approach management/ownership but bankers have become involved in almost every deal today. It’s sometimes possible to acquire spinoffs of companies without bankers involved but even then there’s a good chance someone’s representing them as well.Most fund operate in a, or a few, specific sectors (e.g. industrials, telecom, tech, service co’s., pharma, or whatever) at specific sizes so you keep networking with executives and advisors in those industries to try to unearth an off market deal and so that if a banked deal does come along those execs/owners/advisors of the selling company know you personally. It’s a lot easier when a target’s investment banker brings them a bid from the person they’ve met and know rather than a random name from a random fund.As for what metrics you look for, it depends on your fund’s strategy. If you are in it for financial engineering and leverage, you look for cash flow that can service a soon to be highly levered company. If you’re looking for growth, you look for recent past growth, a product/service with enough open market potential to continue growth with a few operational tweaks and new equity and/or debt financing, if you’re a restructuring fund you look for a troubled company you think you can turn around or has assets to sell that are worth more than you can buy them for. That’s a vast over simplification and there are many other metrics and analyses but it’s really strategy dependent.","358,956 followers",Sean Kernan,9.1K,5.6K,726.9M,2017,https://www.quora.com/Who-are-the-best-PE-firms-for-emerging-technology-companies-that-are-still-under-5-mill-in-revenue

This is especially important as the number of Internet of Things (IoT) devices rises, along with the amount of data they generate.Credit image:20 Industries The Tech Could Transform:1. Manufacturing2. Energy & Utilities3. AgricultureThe technologies currently available are not advanced enough to cope with the massive data quantities and speeds required for smart farming. The agriculture industry will have to wait longer than most industries to reap the benefits of 5G, as 5G networks will largely be deployed in urban areas first.4. Retail5. Financial Services6. Media & Entertainment7. Healthcare8. Transportation9. AR/VRBoth AR and VR technologies require a cheaper, more extensive network with lower latency and more consistency to continue developing successfully. AR and VR require massive amounts of data to be processed. An unreliable and lagging connection can ruin the immersive experiences, even making users physically sick.With a 10x decrease in latency, 100x improvement in traffic capacity, and 100x improvement in network efficiency, 5G could address these issues. This is critical for the mass adoption of AR and VR.10. InsuranceWith more efficient data sharing, health and life insurers could make more informed and accurate decisions when it comes to providing quotes. As wearable 5G-connected healthcare devices gain popularity, health insurers could offer “positive reinforcement” policies, where premiums would be reduced if a certain level of activity or fitness is maintained.11. EducationFor students in high-risk fields such as medicine and aviation, these VR learning experiences could prove to be especially useful.12. Cloud ComputingThe technology’s ultra-low latency and high throughput would also allow the cloud computing experience to rival corporate LAN connectivity to desktops.13. Gaming5G could solve the latency problems that currently face cloud-based gaming. Feedback would feel instantaneous, as latency would be reduced from 4G’s 10 milliseconds to 1-2 milliseconds. This technology would benefit those playing complex multiplayer games like Fornite on their phones — or any other mobile device, for example.14. Real Estate15. Public SafetyAn enhanced network of sensors, cameras, and other automated devices would become help create a fuller picture of any public safety situations, potentially making cities around the world safer to live in.16. Supply Chain Management5G-enabled IoT devices could improve food tracking and waste disposal. Ordering platforms, from menus to drive-throughs, could evolve into more immersive and interactive experiences for customers, as 5G allows enhanced performance with better speeds and lower latency.With all of these new 5G technologies, the restaurant industry is likely to see reduced costs, more efficient food production, and enhanced consumer experiences.18.
