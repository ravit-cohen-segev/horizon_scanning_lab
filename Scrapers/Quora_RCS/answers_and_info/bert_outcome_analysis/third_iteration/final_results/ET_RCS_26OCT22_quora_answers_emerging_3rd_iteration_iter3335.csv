0,"You might find some insight in the pages of the book of Enoch. Jesus and Jude both quote the book of Enoch, and I’m not sure why the early church fathers left it out… probably too bizarre to believe. But as more and more things are discovered around the world (megalithic structures, and all the weirdness that goes along with them) you simply HAVE to start re examining the narrative of “stone age, then copper age, then iron age,” etc.With that said, I would imagine the wars fought back then were like nothing we can imagine. And that’s about all I can say.","220,549 followers",Franklin Veaux,1.5K,47.3K,782.4M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Suppose-Noahs-flood-was-real-and-humans-before-the-flood-had-advanced-technology-lived-to-be-hundreds-of-years-old-and-had-access-to-every-dinosaur-How-would-wars-probably-be-fought

3,"First of all, those people who think that the Yemenis are not responsible for this attack are lying to themselves, you are falling into the Saudi Arabia trap, what Trap I am talking about, Saudi Arabia leaders live in a fantasy, look at how they speak about Yemenis and houthis, they belittle them, they keep acting as if Yemenis are poor beggars that cannot fight and are not worthy, they keep talking as if Yemeni people are some mountain hillbillies that do not know how to fight and how to act ……. more and more underestimation of what Yemeni people can do, I have never seen that much underestimFirst of all, those people who think that the Yemenis are not responsible for this attack are lying to themselves, you are falling into the Saudi Arabia trap, what Trap I am talking about, Saudi Arabia leaders live in a fantasy, look at how they speak about Yemenis and houthis, they belittle them, they keep acting as if Yemenis are poor beggars that cannot fight and are not worthy, they keep talking as if Yemeni people are some mountain hillbillies that do not know how to fight and how to act ……. more and more underestimation of what Yemeni people can do, I have never seen that much underestimation and dehumanization to the Level of an animal like how the Saudis look at Yemenis, they take the Medal, and that is why they are losing, many powerful empires attempted to conquer Yemen in the past, but they all failed, we are talking about empires that had mighty power, so why would you think the Saudis have any chance of winning.second, there is nothing wrong in the US radars and advanced tech, they are just pointing towards the entities that did not do this attack, all those tech are pointed towards Iran and Iraq, and if Iran, or Iraq would have launched the attack, I can assure you 100% that they would have been noticed, and the radars will work, so what is the area that US tech is not pointed at, its the mountainous borders between North Yemen and Saudi Arabia another likely story is that its possible that the Yemenis launched the attack from inside Saudi Arabia, the drones hit the Oil refinery from the back.third, What is with all the people who woke up as of late about this attack, as if its the first attack done by the Yemeni people deep inside Saudi Territory, understand something, Saudi Arabia thought that the Yemenis are an easy picking but due to Saudi incompetence the Yemenis are deep in Saudi Territory ages before this attack, there is a video of Yemeni fighters even walking in a Saudi Town, the Saudi Soldiers in bases deep in Saudi land fled and left all their equipment inside, this is how much Saudi Arabia is incompetent, and before this Oil attack, the Yemeni army reached and launched an attack on Saudi Arabia own capital Riyadh international airport, so how come everyone all of sudden is susceptible when Yemenis have done a lot of successful missions deep in Saudi territory, its not like its the first time.fourth, I see people trying to make speculations of why did this attack happen, as if people were born yesterday or do not live on the same planet, have you forgot already that Saudi Arabia and its band of mercenary have launched a genocide campaign in Yemen which killed a lot of people half of which are kids, and starved the other half, have you forgot that Saudi Arabia is at war with Yemen, this attack is to tell Saudi Arabia that “hey, look, your pockets are in danger, you keep attacking and slaughtering our people, we will keep burning your Money maker which is oil”, the fact that some US senators and a group of Politicians in the west that blindly support Saudi Arabia are more butthurt about the oil than the Saudis means that the Yemenis have struck a nerve a very vital nerve in Saudi Arabia, the Yemenis right now are holding a powerful card they can pressure the terror coalition with.Finally, Saudi Arabia is embarrassed, is in shock, that a group of people that they belittle, that they consider to be inferior humans according to them, are capable of conducting such an attack, and will blame everyone but Yemenis, even if it was the Yemeni people.",119 followers,Mazen Al-Angari,1.8K,0,0,2019,https://www.quora.com/Suppose-Noahs-flood-was-real-and-humans-before-the-flood-had-advanced-technology-lived-to-be-hundreds-of-years-old-and-had-access-to-every-dinosaur-How-would-wars-probably-be-fought
4,"In 2003 I was working for Cisco Systems and at the time we learned that the US Department of Defense had worked with Intel and other chip manufacturers to install in their hardware the ability to remotely disable any device using their technology with a certain radio frequency.

Supposedly, this technology was used to help cripple the Iraqi air defense system when the US invaded.This was important to Cisco because we were working in security and cryptography and the NSA was forever trying to get us to corrupt our products so they could un-encrypt foreign transmissions on the fly. One time we were required to corrupt product that had been shipped to China and it started a major debate about our fiduciary responsibility to the country or to the customer. The issue was that if you sell a security product that you know is corrupted, you are knowingly committing fraud and are liable. As the Product Manager at the time I asked the NSA if they would stand behind us (and me as I might be personally liable) in court if we were discovered. Of course the answer from the NSA was “Hell no.”We were on our own. We then entered into a long debate about how to detect Easter eggs and other corruption introduced into security products unknowingly through another vendor’s corrupted hardware. The issue was never resolved but it should be known that our security source code HAD to be provided to the NSA in order to get FIPS certification and they made certain changes to it.So to answer your question, USA military technology is advanced far beyond anyone’s knowledge to describe the extent.On the other hand, the Chinese probably know more about our technology than we do since they perpetrated the greatest security breach in history by compromising the RSA key technology used by almost everyone in the world. We only learned of it through the vigilance of Lockheed-Martin who discovered the breach accidentally. But for months the Chinese had the key to almost every computer in the world.","16,058 followers",Pavel Fekula,929,11K,118.5M,2017,https://www.quora.com/Why-does-the-US-with-all-its-advance-technology-and-huge-military-present-fail-to-stop-even-a-drone-from-attacking-the-Saudi-oil-complex

If it is Israel, the US will tell Israel: ‘don’t do it again.’ If it is the US that staged this attack, someone else is to blame.

6,"The most simple answer is that American forces are not deployed in any large numbers on Saudi soil. The defense of the KSA and its oil facilities is the responsibility of Riyadh, not Washington DC.Aside from a small training contingent, the US does not want to deploy forces on Saudi soil bc it encourages Saudi radicals who view any foreign presence to be a blasphemy against their understanding of Islam. The Saudi and American governments know this, so, barring a threat of invasion, you won’t find that presence at that level.","16,058 followers",Pavel Fekula,533,11K,118.5M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Why-does-the-US-with-all-its-advance-technology-and-huge-military-present-fail-to-stop-even-a-drone-from-attacking-the-Saudi-oil-complex
