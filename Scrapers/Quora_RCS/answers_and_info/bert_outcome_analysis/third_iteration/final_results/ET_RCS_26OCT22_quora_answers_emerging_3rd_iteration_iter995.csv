As Robert Wright argues in the amazing book,Most of the massive changes driving human history have been communications revolutions. I mean this in the sense that they enable more and more brains to be in close proximity to one another -- creating, spreading and iterating ideas/technologies more rapidly than was previously imaginable.There are a few major communications revolutions in human history that qualify.The development of languageSo what will be the next?  Well, if you buy the argument that the big revolutions are those that bring more and more brains into proximity of each other, then the next big change will be the merging of the internet with our brains.Right now, the main things keeping our brains from being literally connected to the internet areBut things change.My guess is that the technology that enables our brains to communicate with the internet will start with the treatment of major neurological disabilities.The therapeutic use cases could very easily evolve into enhancement. Human enhancement of this nature raises a massive host of ethical issues.But again, things change.I don't know if this will lead to the Singularity that people like Ray Kurzweil talk about.

4,"Thanks for the A2A.The question when I answered it is “What are the next big trends in mechanical engineering”There are actually more trends going on right now than most people think and they’re all happening simultaneously.

Trends occur for one of a few reasons (all are business reasons so if you want to try to change the trends good luck with that). These are government regulations, product improvements, cost reductions.The most obvious trend is green technology/environmental engineering This stems more from government regulations that people asking for more green technology (people really aren’t asking for green technology). So things like electric/hybrid cars, solar cells (yes I know this is primarily electrical but there are mechanical aspects to it), pollution reduction systems, etc.Product improvements is where many of the people in industry look at trends. The biggest trends here I’m going to call interdisciplinary integration (there isn’t really a word for it and people don’t notice it too much they just started doing it). This is the combination of two specialties into a third new specialty, the most obvious of which is mechatronics (the combination of mechanics and electronics). The are other combinations too. Biomechanics is fairly new (has been around for a while but is picking up more steam now), Electronics and materials are combining to make super tiny sensors. mechanical and Aerospace/aeronautical are combining, there are a bunch others and I’m sure I will miss most so I’m going to stop here.The biggest trend (at least in my opinion) is happening in the cost reduction space. Simulation is becoming HUGE, its turning into either you use simulation or your company goes under kinda thing. 20 years ago simulation didn’t really exist in mainstream engineering because of the cost and the amount of computation needed to reach a usable result. Data analytics is also becoming huge. This is going hand in hand with the tiny sensors that the electronics and materials people are making. The idea is that the more sensors you have, the more data you can obtain, the tighter your design tolerances can be, the less waste you make (You can use data analytics for a bunch more than this but this seems to be the popular route in mechanical engineering). Then there is additive manufacturing, most people call this 3D printing but that is a small subset of additive manufacturing. Most manufacturing is done through subtractive manufacturing which is when you continuously remove material until your product is finished. This clearly creates a lot of waste and it becomes incrementally difficult to reclaim this waste material. Additive manufacturing only adds material together until your product is finished which greatly reduces this waste and save money that way.So next time you’re looking for trends (especially in mechanical engineering) remember…1.) interdisciplinary integration is a thing even if there isn’t really a term for it (if someone know of a term for this please let me know because I feel like an idiot for not knowing it). This results in new products/markets and will always be going on.2.) Look at government regulations. If the government has a plan to change a standard by some time mechanical engineers are involved (right now it’s climate)3.) Look at ways to reduce costs.Hope this helps",181 followers,Anuj Kumar,2.4K,55,2.7M,2016,https://www.quora.com/What-will-be-the-next-truly-revolutionary-technological-development-to-see-widespread-use

A very futuristic design.4) Startups in various countries are already planning routes.Disgruntled by the “soul-destroying traffic”, serial entrepreneur Elon Musk sent out a couple of tweets last December. What started as musings on twitter, ended up as a full blown startup aptly named ‘The Boring Company’5) Hyperloop will be completely self sustainable.The technology that powers the compressor needed to run the Hyperloop tubes will be solar powered, with the tubes lined with Solar Panels and energy storage capacitors so that it doesn't loose efficiency or power even under cloudy conditions.6) Hyperloop's design requires it to travel only in a straight line.The tech by design is a rapid mode of transportation, sometimes accelerating to more speed than a human can handle, and as such, the tubes need to be in a straight path to avoid any untoward accidents.7) The tech requires pods to be spaced 5 miles apart.While there are emergency brakes for each pod, the design requires the pods to be spaced 5 miles apart from each other, with one pod leaving every 30 seconds, and the space between the tube and the pod being small enough to stop pods easily in case of an emergency.8) The Hyperloop pods will be designed using Dense AluminiumThe train would be comprised of durable aluminum pods that would contain skis with a durable SpaceX alloy called Inconel. The acceleration speeds were a concern but the element encased in this element to handle high pressure and heat.9) Elon Musk believes Hyperloop to be the transport mode of choice on Mars.It's not a secret that Elon Musk's true love is Space Exploration. His plans for starting a colony on Mars also involves planning cities and it's mode of transport. The natural atmosphere of Mars ensures that the Hyperloop tubes will not be required to build the mode of transport on Mars!But what about earthquakes, you say?Few Glimpses from futureWaiting for the future!",0 followers,Rohit Kapoor,7.8K,2K,23.3M,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-next-big-thing-in-the-field-of-Mechanical-Engineering

This rapidly growing field is one that offers abundant opportunities for mechanical engineers.In the years ahead, mechanical engineers are expected to be integral in using nanotechnology to:BiomechatronicsThe role of mechanical engineers in robotics is taken a step even further with the rapid growth of biomechatronics. This field, which seeks to merge body and machine, involves the design and testing of complex and intricate device architectures that mimic the body’s musculoskeletal design.Mechanical engineers will be primarily involved in the design of mechanical sensors, controllers, and actuators for biomedical devicesManufacturingManufacturing is an ever-evolving field. Mounting pressures to increase production efficiency while minimizing operating costs have fueled demand for new and innovative technologies.Automation and roboticsNon-of the engineering is dead end...Edit:1.0For people in the comment section asking the reason for high unemployment for Mechanical Engineers. To answer the questionThe Problem of unemployment is not only with Mechanical Engineers, but with the whole Industrial Sector.A lot of Electrical Engineers and Electronics Engineers are working in IT Services like TCS, Infosys, Wipro, CTS, IBM etc.Many Civil and Mechanical Engineers are either working in Banking Services or pursuing Teaching in Coaching Classes.Some are selling Credit CardsFortunate Ones are going to US, Germany, Netherland to pursue M.S.The reason for this is, after Independence Indian economy has shifted gradually from Agriculture Sector to Service Sector (be it formal or Informal) leavingAccordingly the Share of Workforce in the Industrial Sector also remained Stagnant.However, Total no of Engineering graduates each year has risen drastically leaving many graduates unemployed.As per National Employability report engineers annual report 2019, Approximately 80 percent of Indian engineering graduates are not employable in the current knowledge-driven economy. This signify the pathetic condition of engineering education in India. Some major initiative in the direction of quality of education, is the need of the hour.What are Future Prospects of Industrial SectorIt has already been perceived our Government that Industrial & Manufacturing growth is the best route for overall economic development.Make In India, Skill Development, Start-up India, Stand-up India, Entrepreneurship Skill Development Program are some of the examples.Under Make in India thrust sectors have been identified to provide a push to manufacturing and Start-up India to strengthen the start-up ecosystem.The Ease of Doing Business initiative aims to create a conducive environment by streamlining existing regulations and processes and eliminating unnecessary requirements and procedures.Foreign Direct Investment policy and procedures have been simplified and liberalised progressively.Hope Future Industrial Sector is Bright, Everyone will be Employed !.Thank you Ayana Vini for pointing this out..Edit-2.0For people contending that the rate of innovation in Computer Science and Electronics is much higher and there is very less innovation in Mechanical engineering.I agree that the rate of innovation in computer science and electronics is far than the mechanical engineering.I totally agree.However, There is a world beyond the computer too. We can not eat data, we can not wear motherboard and we can not brush our teeth with a transistor & we can not drive a mouse.What i mean to say that for the innovations in computer science and electronics to use practically we always have to have a base. Where will we use those innovations ?? We will use these innovation in electronics over a car, or robot, or drone or rocket or spaceship or aeroplane , helicopter, fighter plane or any other equipment which must have a chance of using Mechanical engineering and we can witness the innovations in these technologies, can’t we?The rate of innovations in computer science and electronics is higher because these are new for the humanity. Both came into existence in the later 20th century and innovation has just picked up in the last decade. Hence, everything is new for us and we are able to perceive the little changes in it. Like after every 6 months we see a new smart phone with some new technology. There are millions of Applications releasing everyday. It looks quite fascinating to us, isn’t it ?However, we have been unable to see the innovations in materials. We don’t know about carbon fiber. We have ignored these innovations in Biomechanics.AWe have no idea about innovation in the field of Fluid dynamics because we can not feel it.There are innovations in mechanical Engineering too.The world is dreaming about a flying car, an smart robot, smart machines, and smart materials.There are huge innovation in nanotechnology, robotics, biomechanics going on.And i hope that in the NEXT EPIDEMIC like CORONA virus our worriers will be smart robots equipped with artificial intelligence ( off course credit goes to computer science), who will be carrying the infected to the hospitals and operating them.And in the coming time biotechnology is going to take over both Computer Science and Electronics Engineering as world has started witnessing biological warfare.Where as Mechanical Engineering will keep growing with the slow pace like a tortoise!Regards,ReferenceImage Source -phone gallery & GoogleMechanical engineering - Wikipedia4 Things to Expect for the Future of Mechanical Engineeringhttps://www.gedcouncil.org/sites/default/files/Engineering+Education+in+India+Dec1608-1.pdfDATA STORY | 80% of Indian engineering graduates not employable, says surveyIndia struggles but Bangladesh's GDP rides high on manufacturing, export boomKey Initiatives for Industrial Development Post GST and Demonetisation",0 followers,Glen Boston,655,71,1.7M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-next-big-thing-in-the-field-of-Mechanical-Engineering

He is an engineering manager with one of the biggest pharmaceutical companies today, and when we were in college I helped him (or watched & fetched beer) while he modified the engine on his car (added a 4 barrell carb to an old V8 and tuned it). Same with building experimenta hydrofoils for a catamaran sailboat. Later he built an intercooler for his non-intercooled turbocharged car. Still later he built a fiberglass shell around a vintage wooden boat. He us currently building a heat exchager system to take the waste heat from his home air conditioner to heat his pool (a thing that apparently works so well it is a wonder that they are not commercially available). This guy has always been a hands-on builder. But in his job he mainly manages other engineers now.Then there is my brother. He is handy, and does typical car and home repairs, but does not “build” things. BUT in his career working for the marine unit of a giant oil company he designs floating refinery platforms. These are multi-billion dollar projects that are built in huge shipyards, and thousands of builders do exactly what he tells them. The stakes are huge and mistakes are unacceptible. And he is (to put it bluntly) a mechanical engineering guru. His projects have always been succesful, and he has been brought on to fix other engineer’s mistakes before they became catastrophes. He has grown from designing and supervising individual subsystems to full marine engineering orojects. But he is not the kind of guy who builds mechanical devices for fun at home (though he does light carpentry)These guys are both mechanical engineers… *excellent* mechanical engineers. One builds mechanical devices for fun, and tends to be very hands-on, the other does not. Having a mechanical engineering degree did not automatically make them the way they are.The same goes for other engineering disciplines. I’d use myself as an example for electrical engineering, but I went into computers and software before I even earned my degree.

Even then, cooling will be a major issue, but the advantage of volumetric computing will be unparalleled.3D Printing3D printing will likely be involved to assemble the CPUs, network wiring, internal sensors, wired connections, and cooling tubes in the data block. The engineering process will be to assemble the cube, boot it up, and evaluate the extent and quality of the cube and turning off portions that are non-functional. Current integrated circuit technology performs these tasks regularly, and the circuits voluntarily shutting off areas that do not work.Component InterfacesA volumetric computer will have electrical, network, and cooling connections, but won’t need much more to operate. A cube the size of a basketball could replace entire data centers. B2B transactions across hundreds of business partners might not ever need to leave one cube.Example Hypothesis SourcesThis hypothesis is an extrapolation of 3D printing,Satellite BasedPutting entire data centers into a space the size of a basketball really points towards satellite operation, and I could see swarms of these circling the Earth. Individual rocket launches are becoming cheaper per satellite while real estate and energy on Earth become more expensive.

This will not appear to be helpful to all the people who make their living driving, particularly truck drivers, but it will accomplish their tasks without requiring nearly as much human intervention and might, as a result, greatly reduce the transportation costs associated with every product. Likewise with services like taxis and Uber in which transporting someone to a destination, such as an airport, or even a shopping mall, might become super-simple, and therefore super-inexpensive.I get that there are people who have jobs now because such an ability doesn’t exist, and any lost job feels terrible at the time, but that is not where the benefits will come. There will be other drawbacks to this future, which I am certain that many commenters will list at length under the mistaken assumption that I don’t realize that it’s a two edged sword, so I’ll get to those. But before we get to the glass-half-empty mindset, let me give you the dramatic advantages.I say this is the next technical breakthrough because it is imminent. Driverless vehicles are a near-term reality and while they’ll probably go through a 3 to 7 year adoption and adjustment cycle, the world at the end of those 7 years will be vastly different than it is before it. Once fully adopted, total knowledge of traffic patters will make public transportation far more viable in ways that it is not now. By more viable I mean, not requiring taxpayer subsidies to run profitably.A side technology that will co-evolve is monitoring systems which will be necessary to minimize vandalism, but will have the added advantage that they’ll improve passenger safety.This isn’t without negatives, however. Much like cell-phones, this creates a situation ripe for abuse, and it will have negative consequences as well. The positives will far outweigh the negatives as they do any time you reduce the competence necessary for humans to achieve things, but the negatives will be there even after the current professional drivers of the world have found their new niches to thrive in. Probably biggest among these are the ‘big brother’ fears of too much knowledge and power being concentrated in the hands of too few people. It’s not a free lunch. It’s just a breakthrough that is so near-term with so many companies concurrently pursuing it that I think it’s the","4,192 followers",Antonello Frau,4.9K,2.8K,17.6M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-will-be-the-next-truly-revolutionary-technological-development-to-see-widespread-use

18,"A technology revolution is both desperately needed and highly likely to come in the area of mental health. This is true for three reasons: (i) mental health has reached crisis status, (ii) mental health is a booming area of medical research with high levels of tech transfer from academic labs, and (iii) brain technology is benefiting greatly from tech advances in other fields.Mental Health Crisis1A technology revolution is both desperately needed and highly likely to come in the area of mental health. This is true for three reasons: (i) mental health has reached crisis status, (ii) mental health is a booming area of medical research with high levels of tech transfer from academic labs, and (iii) brain technology is benefiting greatly from tech advances in other fields.Mental Health Crisis1 in 5 American adults experience a mental illness. [1] [2] This number is likely to be higher in developing nations. If you live past the age of 60 you have a nearly 30% chance of being killed by some form of dementia.  [3]The prevailing theory used to posit that alleviating socioeconomic hardships would drive down all diseases; while this is true for many diseases of the last century, by virtue of longer life-spans other diseases have emerged, most famously: dementia. Other mental health challenges are also on the rise—Those suffering from Autism Spectral Disorder make up approximately 1 in 132 individuals (and growing) [4], 1–3 of every 100 will experience epileptic seizures in their lifetime,  [5]and a whopping 1 in 10 with mood disorders [6].Biomedical Research: Focus on the BrainIn 2011 nearly a quarter of the National Institutes of Health $32B budget went to ‘neurosciences’ related projects.  [7]The proportion of brain work through this agency has bloomed following new initiatives focusing on breakthrough technological advances from the field [8].While some areas of basic research have legitimate reasons to complain about stagnating funding, medical research cannot. The NIH currently provides 50% greater funding than it did in the year 2000. Much of this growth has occurred in brain research. That being said, it is also easy to say that it isn’t enough to meet the demand and needs of those afflicted with debilitating disease. When the quality of life of 1 in 5 humans is on the line, mental health issues should continue to take a front and center position among public policy issues.
