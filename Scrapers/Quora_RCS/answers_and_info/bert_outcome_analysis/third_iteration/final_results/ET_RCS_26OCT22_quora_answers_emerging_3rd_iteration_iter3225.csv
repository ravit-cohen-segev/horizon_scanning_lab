3,We can develop various high level technology in our own country. We have various good university in India giving same standard of education like developed countries.The problem is you need a lot of money to do research to develop new technology.

It will become latest technology for Indian people.The main reason why this is happining is1.India needs population control: Due to high population we are not able to spend money on new scientific research. India as a country has to feed a population on 135 crore or 1.35 billion people so a lot of money of our country goes for providing subsidised food education clothes etc.2. There is not much awareness among Indian people related to development of new technology in India.A)A lot of money in India is wasted on political activity with more than 200 political parties in India.Indian people are overinterested in politics. Every year new political are inaugurated. This leads to more corruption.B)Religious activities such as celebrating festivals is done very lavishly in India. People give lavish amount of money to various spiritual organizations of different religions.Religious organisations are also making big money like politicians in IndiaC)lavish marriages expences and dowry :In India we need to reduce lavish marriages and dowry .If India as a country can control population growth stop wasting money on lavish marriages and dowry. Reduce the number of political parties in India to 5or 6 only.stop wasting too much money on spiritual organizations and festival celebration.We can use the money for science and technology research and development,189 followers,Prashant Kumar,5.7K,428,335.1K,2018,https://www.quora.com/Rather-than-use-prophets-and-holy-books-why-doesnt-God-use-much-more-advanced-technology-to-reveal-Himself-to-the-world-By-advanced-I-mean-something-akin-to-the-fictional-Tears-of-the-Prophets-See-link-for-reference

It can do the job, much faster and perfectly.In manufacturing, research and development, and technology India doesn't even stand a chance against China. Comparing the two is preposterous. The pathetic state of Indian manufacturing can be gauged from the fact that 69 years after independence, India can't even manufacture products as simple as earphones. Yes, even your earphones are probably manufactured in China, though they might contain a Made in India tag, to fool the Indians.Comparing the two countries would be a great injustice to China. Most of Chinese people don't want their country to be compared with India, they think of it below their dignity, the same way we think of Pakistan.

5,Hey i appreciate your question and well it is questioned by many. Since india is a diverse country with people having different perceptions about a certain thing. We lag behind a lot in terms of education i think this is the major factor we ain’t able to develop it . Other major factors are lack of Fund and planning as well. I must say planning is easy execution is herculean. But surely after a decade or two we would shine the brightest as IT sector is growing day by day.Thanks for your question..,4 followers,Carl Elliott,14K,0,0,2018,https://www.quora.com/Rather-than-use-prophets-and-holy-books-why-doesnt-God-use-much-more-advanced-technology-to-reveal-Himself-to-the-world-By-advanced-I-mean-something-akin-to-the-fictional-Tears-of-the-Prophets-See-link-for-reference

The history of USA begins with revolutions - the rail road connecting the west to east - the inter state highways etc…It is easier to show than to tell. Let me show you a few maps and try to figure out why China is developing faster than India.Exhibit 1 - USAExhibit 2 - CANADAExhibit 3 - EuropeExhibit 4 - ChinaExhibit 5- IndiaTHE YELLOW LINESDo you see the yellow lines? The yellow lines are six lane express ways - Interstate high speed lines. Do you see how many highways exist in USA? USA is filled with yellow lines - These yellow lines are like high speed - 1GBPS optical fibers laid across the country i.e. I can take my huge truck full of cars from one corner of my country to the other without applying any brakes in full throttle and conduct my business. i.e. SELL;Now COMPARE USA with CANADA.In Canada - Unfortunately only three cities are well connected with Highways - Toronto - Ottawa - Montreal - Qubec city and Nova Scotia - The rest of he nation is a barren waste land - Yes people live there but - they are virtually disconnected - unless they are willing to fly!So is USA better than CANADA - Not Really - USA has a better climate than Canada - If Canada was not the SIBERIA of AMERICAS it would have been filled with mesh of express ways like USA.EUROPE VS RUSSIAThe tale repeats - The most concentration of expressways is in a few countriesNetherlands - Belgium Germany -Denmark - France - Have this tightly knit spider web of express ways - Check them outCHINA vs INDIANow let us take a look at china - They laid so many roads that it is filled with express ways - six lane roadsCompare that with IndiaIndia has only two express ways - For a country of Billion People(1) New Delhi - Agra - Lucknow - The Yamuna Express way - (Vishal Khanna - Thanks for the edit )-(2) Ahmedabad to Vadodara - Barely visible on this mapPAKISTAN - It has one huge expressway connecting - Islamabad - Lahore - Peshawar - Thank to CHINA.What is TRADE?(1) MANUFACTURING AND SERVICES - Development Products (R&D) or People (training)(2) LOGISTICS - The movement of Goods or People(3) SALES AND MARKETING - The art of Selling Goods or PeopleLet us take this simple definition - for practical purposes - There are tons of other factors involved in trade and development - like Imports - Exports - Comparative Advantage - Exchange Rates - Fiscal Policy - Monetary PolicyLet us ignore all of them for a moment - Let us consider internal trade of various countries.The hallmark of a developed country is the ease of trade - The ease of starting a business.If I do not have a place to sit - i.e. to set up shop - Where would I start Manufacturing or Training PeopleIn India - If I wish to set up a factory - I would not have any buildings - I would not find any free space - If I do find a free space - There would be tons of red tape before I can get approvals - If there is no infrastructure to begin with I would not be able to do anything. I visit the local government school and I find that the roof leaks when it rains - does not have a fan in hot summer - is not connected by roads - the roads that are laid - were laid ten years ago and are now filled with pot holes. LOGISTICS i.e. the art of moving goods - there are no roads - There are no air ports - there are no shipping ports. SALES and MARKETING - selling Indian Goods - is pain not just in the ass but all over! You will understand this because - every Indian Good falls short in quality - according to international standards - most of the Indian goods are discarded i.e. thrown away because they don’t fit the requirements set by the buyer. Corruption is not a problem - it never was - Businessmen would earn more profits to pay for the corrupt - but the problem is that the corrupt money is not being used for infrastructure - China is as corrupt as India!What is China Doing?China has many structural advantages compared to IndiaThey are communists - They will kill anyone who stands in the way of the state! They will not hesitate - They will not forgive - They will exterminate ruthlessly.The state is atheist not secular - The state only tolerates religion and culture - mind the word TOLERATES i.e. if the state at any point of time believes that the religion is against the state or any culture is against the state - It will exterminate the religion or the culture. The great cultural destruction during Mao’s era is a proof of the extremes to which Chinese would go!It is a very good thing - China had a clean slate - a fresh slate - a slate cleansed with blood of many people who died during the struggle. China got rid of all the superstitions along with their old culture. India on the other hand lives in these superstitions -China is a COPY PASTE MACHINE - of profit makingChina copies - it copies profit making machines - If a business model is working - they will copy it - They copied Iphone - not just the phone but the Istore - that is an incredible achievement - They copied KFC - They copied McDonalds i.e. in china there is a chain of McDonald stores - not owned by McDonald. They have a copy of facebook - they have a copy of uber - they have a copy of twitter - they have a copy of a copy of a copy i.e. there are other companies trying to make copies of the chinese copies.The entire chinese state understood - the necessity of development - and they are pushing for it at any cost. Most of the chinese cities are covered with smog - but chinese can’t afford to stop their development - They need to make goods - services and sell them to make profits - as long as they make profits they develop.The Chinese are done with roads within their countryThe Chinese are done with RailsThe Chinese are done with PORTS - All these are ports developed by ChinaThe Growth Engine of China owes a lot of its Exports and Export trade is done by ships - not by road or by rail. Globalization happened over Container Terminals, Ports and Oceans - Unfortunately most of Indian - Ports are unfit for Docking International Ships - Hilarious but True - Indians never invested in making their ports world class - Chinese are done with ports not only in their country but also internationally -The Chinese are NOT Done with AIRPORTS YETThe only comparable infrastructure of India with China is in terms of AIRPORTS - India can compete with China on air traffic.But this too will pass - With China building hundreds of airports - by 2020 they will induct more than 100 new airports - to tackle the extreme congestion and delays in air port travel across the nation.I WILL SUM IT UPIndia pales in comparison to China in International PatentsNOTHING CAN BE DONE WITHOUT INVESTMENT IN INFRASTRUCTURE - i.e. utilization of WEALTH to create more WEALTH - which starts a virtuous cycleEquivalent to investing the first twenty years of your life to education - China spent twenty years of its life from 1980 to 2000 in learning about developing profit making machines and investing in them - building cities - tows - roads - railways - and everything and anything in a mad rush to build - sell - repeat;make - sell - repeat; after millions of these selling cycles to international customers - The Country is now reaping the fruits of its investments made decades ago and pursued relentlessly.",26 followers,Balaji Viswanathan,10.7K,5.6K,427M,2017,https://www.quora.com/Why-is-India-lagging-in-advanced-technology-For-example-India-will-buy-bullet-trains-from-Japan-why-can-t-we-develop-that-by-our-own

That would be absurd.Government should not just plan for 2016, but also for 2030. The investments in highways and metro trains 15 years ago are now paying off as we zip through the highways and trains. By 2030, we would have 4 times bigger economy and 20 crore more people in the middle class. How are we going to move them?The middle class of 2030 would choke without fast transportation. Airports would be clogged, roads would be beyond their capacity and express trains cannot move people fast enough. On the other hand, bullet trains can transport people fast enough for them to leave their cars and planes behind.By moving the entrepreneurs and merchants fast enough, we can produce a lot more value to the economy. Would you rather have a productive entrepreneur stuck in a slow moving train between Mumbai and Ahmedabad or be producing something useful on the ground? Again when the merchant leaves the polluting cars and airplanes for an electricity driven bullet train, we can have cleaner skies [assuming in parallel we can move out of coal as a producer of electricity]. The bullet trains can reduce the acute scarcity in availability of train tickets as well as reduce accidents [the alternate is the much riskier car transportation].Two centuries ago people would not have comprehended the need for a train. Horses and oxen did their job well. Now, it is hard to imagine India without its railways. We have to now get into the next era of innovation. High speed trains are the future as we can see in Europe and east Asia. They are far more cleaner and convenient than air travel and much more convenient than regular train travel. It would push both business and tourism.The same answer also applies to why India invests in Mars missions & lunar landings when some basics like water and electricity needs to be fixed. Of course, we have to invest in the basics too, but this idea of sequentially doing things doesn't always work. We have to build the basics as well as the advanced sciences in parallel.Just as a student eats for today as well as studies for the exams to come in a few months, we have to invest our efforts in both present as well as the future. Just as a driver looks both at the traffic ahead as well as mentally plans his route, we have to think both long and short.We cannot let our present cloud our future.Also see:",26 followers,Balaji Viswanathan,5.1K,5.6K,427M,2016,https://www.quora.com/Why-is-India-lagging-in-advanced-technology-For-example-India-will-buy-bullet-trains-from-Japan-why-can-t-we-develop-that-by-our-own

The researchers discovered that the glass was impregnated with particles of silver and gold.The metal particles measure about 50–70 nanometers diameter, smaller than the wavelengths of visible light, but through colloids with other particles are able to absorb various wavelengths.The effect of the exactly dosed mixture is that it not only creates a two-color effect, but also lights up in different colors depending on the fluid it was filled with.At least that’s the theory, because testing this on a priceless artefact is out of the question. Instead a similar mixture was created in an experiment.The scientists imprinted billions of tiny wells onto a plastic plate about the size of a postage stamp and sprayed the wells with gold or silver nano-particles, essentially creating an array with billions of ultra-miniature Lycurgus Cups. When water, oil, or sugar and salt solutions were poured into the wells, they displayed a range of easy-to-distinguish colors—light green for water and red for oil, for example. The proto­type was 100 times more sensitive to altered levels of salt in solution than current commercial sensors using similar techniques.The Lycurgus Cup - Ancient Roman Glass that Magically Changes ColorsWould it have detected poison in the drink in the cup?

(THE CITY WALL OF NANJING, built 600 years ago, was the first line of defense for the founding capital of the Ming dynasty. Originally 22 miles long, it was built with 350 million bricks, most of which have survived centuries of weathering.Many kinds of materials have been used over the years in masonry mortars, and the technology has gradually evolved from the single-component mortar of ancient times to hybrid versions containing several ingredients. Beginning in 2450 BCE, lime was used as masonry mortar in Europe.Sticky RicePerhaps because of the absence of natural materials such as volcanic ash, hydraulic mortar technology was not developed in ancient China.The earliest record of this technique can be found in an encyclopaedia, theThis use of gummy grains in Chinese concrete as an adhesive is not entirely surprising. Cooked rice was first boiled into a paste, then blended with sand and lime, a substance produced by heating limestone.Scientists have long been fascinated with this unusual formula, and in recent years, different teams have conducted studies to better understand it. Researchers Jiajia Li and Bingjian Zhang spent six years collecting 378 samples of ancient mortar from 159 sites throughout China, dating from the Taosi phase (2300-1900 BC) all the way to the late Qing dynasty (1644-1911).Parts of Nanjing’s city wall are held together with sticky rice mortar. (One notable sample, from a 2000-year-old tomb in Jiangsu province, turned up what the researchers say is the oldest known trace of sticky rice mortar.Pyramid-shapedSticky rice is sweet, and augments savory dishes such asMortar samples from ancient constructions were analyzed by both chemical methods (including the iodine starch test and the acid attack experiment) and instrumental methods (including thermogravimetric differential scanning calorimetry, X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared, and scanning electron microscopy).Mortar samples from halls and the garden of the famed Forbidden City, built in the 15th century, tested positive for the starch.Animal blood might sound like a grisly substance for building walls, but it was a perfectly normal additive used by several cultures. Historical recipes written in French, Italian, and English have detailed ways to mix oxblood and lime mortars.Tiger Hill Pagoda - WikipediaConstruction workers were a disposable commodity when it came to building the wall. It’s estimated that as many as 400,000 people died building the wall, earning it the sobriquet “longest cemetery on Earth.”Many other organic additives favored by the Chinese helped repel water. Oil samples from 87 sites, contained tung oil, a common waterproof seal for wooden ships.Researchers found sugar in the mortar of Suzhou’s Tiger Hill Pagoda. (Great design is often the result of thinking beyond form and function. Philosophy, the researchers posit, might be one poetic inspiration for these fusion pastes:“Ancient Chinese people advocated a view of nature often termed ‘heaven-and-human oneness. The use of agricultural, forestry, and animal products in building materials reflected architectural aesthetics that sought to integrate architecture and nature.”After the Song and Yuan dynasties, the recipe of sticky rice mortar matured, being utilized in the famous Forbidden City in Beijing, a stretch of Great Wall built during the Ming Dynasty, the Chengde Mountain Resort, the Eastern Qing tombs, and the Qiantang River wall built during the Ming and Qing dynasties..Fujian Tulou (“earthen buildings”).(The Fujian Tulou (literally “earthen buildings”) are famous for their durability. Giant multistoried homes capable of housing close to 800 individuals and built with wood and fortified with mud walls were constructed between the 15th and 20th centuries.Incredibly, structures built with sticky rice mortar have survived more than natural erosion. A Ming tomb, of the minister Xu Pu and his wife, was nearly damaged by a bulldozer when found in 1978, but it was “so firm [the vehicle] could do nothing about it.”Although clearly effective, these revolutionary adhesives fell out of fashion in the late Qing dynasty. China’s first cement factory opened in 1889 in Hebei province,Shouchang BridgeBut researchers still see potential in these ancient formulas, especially to stabilize historical sites. Due to high quantities of salt, cement is detrimental and incompatible (being too strong and rigid) with traditional lime-based mortars.In Xichang, Sichuan Province, a restoration projectEvery day, the builders put 500 kilograms of glutinous rice on the boil, and then mix this starchy alternative with a few other ingredients, such as limestone, to form a mortar which will hold the wall together. It’s estimated that the entire project will require an impressive total of 50 tons of rice, in all. At the site of construction, five giant pots are heated over coal, and workers must keep stirring the rice inside these pots to prevent it sticking, as they haven’t invented non-stick crockery of these proportions yet.Researchers and conservationists from the Getty Conservation Insitute have combined the ancient technology of sticky rice with relatively new nanotechnology to develop an innovative treatment for historical sites.","5,990 followers",Jens Böttiger,566,2.6K,17.6M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Why-is-India-lagging-in-advanced-technology-For-example-India-will-buy-bullet-trains-from-Japan-why-can-t-we-develop-that-by-our-own
