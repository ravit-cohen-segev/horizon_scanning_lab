4,"Transfer learning in ML models.Humans are really good at generalizing. We only have to see a few dogs before we can recognize a dog when we see one.Machines are not. ML models require millions of examples before forming a reliable classifier, and that classifier is very specific to the data on which it was trained. If your training data doesn't include dogs with three legs, the model won't recognize them.

It's hypothesized that the reason humans learn so quickly is that we are fitting new examples into our existing knowledge rather than forming entirely new categories. If we could teach machines to do the same, they would learn exponentially faster and apply that learning more effectively.Transfer learning is a very hot topic in AI research right now, so I expect major breakthroughs in the next few years. I think this may be sufficient to achieve artificial general intelligence, but even if not, it will dramatically extend the range of tasks that machines can accomplish.",0 followers,Glen Boston,655,71,1.7M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Is-AI-the-next-big-thing-in-technology

In that time, the US military has embarked on a number of programs like the SPIW and ACR programs that looked into things like caseless ammunition, flechette rounds and a number of other ideas that have yet to offer a sufficient improvement to justify replacing more traditional systems.The US military appears to be considering a new squadSmall arms technology plateaued about 50 years ago.

However I would be surprised if anything like that gets adopted in the next 20 years. The M-249 works well enough, and the US military needs to devote its funding to other more pressing needs.The Russian military has been tinkering with counterbalance rifles like the AK-107 in recent years. These guns have a mass is designed to travel forward to counter out some of the recoil from the bolt’s rearward travel. Nevertheless, these guns will likely only see niche application, like in some squad automatic weapons for special operations units. Most soldiers fire their weapons on semi-auto, so the advantages of the recoil mitigation are not that great and largely canceled out by the added weight.","29,920 followers",Tomaž Vargazon,5.9K,7.7K,249.7M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Is-AI-the-next-big-thing-in-technology

But the things taking almost all the bandwidth... guzzling media and vast volcanoes of *Self-Expression!!*... are bull-puckey.  Sorry.The core features of those earlier, mature creative-competitive arenas is that they are effective of change. In markets, good products and services rise in influence and poor ones fade. Same with POLICY in democracy and Theories in science. These arenas are always in danger and on the verge of failing - anyone can see this.  But they do have this trait, never seen well in other societies.

I reckon this will become the mainstream way we get spare parts by the end of the decade in an optimistic scenario, by the end of the next decade in the pessimistic one.Either way, the moment is as groundbreaking as December 3rd, 1967, when the first human heart ever was transplanted, ushering the era of organ transplants of today.
