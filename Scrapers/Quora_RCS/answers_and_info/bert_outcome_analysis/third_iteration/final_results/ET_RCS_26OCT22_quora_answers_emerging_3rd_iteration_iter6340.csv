2,"Archimedes alone lived over 2000 years ago so I can’t imagine where you got the 400 year number from.Science would date back to basket weaving, curing hides, and making tools from wood, stone, antler, bone, sinew, or plant fibers. It would include fire starting and cooking. It would include some types of food storage and some primitive agriculture. It would include early clothing and some hunting techniques.Chimpanzees and early hominids grasped the value of tools. But there is no indication of testing or development. So, no science.

3,"Evolution. Evolution takes time, and the more time it takes for a species to reproduce, the more time it takes evolution to make changes in the species.As we evolved, we developed greater cognitive ability and eventually learned to control fire, to make and use weapons and tools, to plant seeds and grow crops, to capture animals and breed them. In increments, we developed social groups, began to ask questions about the world around us, and learned to share knowledge.

4,"Excuse me?The development of agriculture and understanding of the seasons is science. The Greeks not only understood that the world is round but had a very good estimate of its size because of science.The wheel is technology. So is gunpowder, concrete (which the Romans had), and the antikythera mechanism.Humans have had “technology” since we first became tool makers, long before the “scientific method”.","284,852 followers",James Altucher,992,878,91.7M,2019,https://www.quora.com/The-human-race-went-through-the-last-100-thousand-years-without-science-or-technology-What-took-it-so-long-to-develop-the-scientific-method-about-400-years-ago-and-evolve-the-human-race-to-where-it-is-today
5,"That is not true.Humans seem to have always had technology. Whether it was unique flint heads for different applications. This in itself is a technology, albeit primitive by our standards.To say they were without the scientific method doesn’t mean that what they were doing didn’t follow principles that we enshrine in that scientific method. Trying, testing, repeating. We also see great signs of what we would call predictive models. Again we see evidence of mass herding of wild beast off cliffs.

A small discovery can lead to massive changes. Fire transformed our species immeasurably, as did the discovery of metals and forging technology, when we discovered steam power it transformed our lives and indeed the world.Whats important to remember is without all of the steps that went before that we wouldn’t have been able to be in the position we are now.The scientific method doesn’t exist in a vacuum. Even if it was declared 50,000 years ago it would have made no difference to us, since it couldn’t be supported. We needed peace, the rule of law, established financial institutions, ownership rights, distribution networks, transport and mail.

6,"Long but interesting story-I went to an Amish sawmill once to discuss placing an order for wooden pallets. The owner was there but his son handled the business end and he would not be back for an hour so I waited. I was having a pleasant conversation about the usual things- how the weather was, how the crops were doing this year, etc and all. During the course of our discussion somehow it came out that I was a mechanic and he had a broken diesel air compressor, so we moved into the building and while I was looking at his compressor (which powered all his shop equipment) I asked him to explainLong but interesting story-I went to an Amish sawmill once to discuss placing an order for wooden pallets. The owner was there but his son handled the business end and he would not be back for an hour so I waited. I was having a pleasant conversation about the usual things- how the weather was, how the crops were doing this year, etc and all. During the course of our discussion somehow it came out that I was a mechanic and he had a broken diesel air compressor, so we moved into the building and while I was looking at his compressor (which powered all his shop equipment) I asked him to explain to me the philosophy regarding the Amish and electricity.His answer was that electricity was not “bad” or “evil” in any sort of way, but that it was for the most part “unnecessary” for most important things in life and the one certainty is that once allowed in where do you draw the line as to what is necessary and what is not? He used electric lights as an example, it is easy to install them and then have light whenever and wherever you need it, but then you wind up subconsciously doing thing you should have done during daylight that you can now do later on and as a result your life can gradually change without you being completely aware of that happening and without being completely aware perhaps it is changing in a way that is not in your best interest and well being. So for many it is their choice to not allow electricity into their household even if many of them now have electrified places of business.Anyway, that is my interpretation of my discussion with one Amish business owner and in no way did I ever get the feeling that technology was something they “feared”, most simply believe there are more important things in life that modern technology has a tendency to usurp given the opportunity.I got his compressor fixed, his son showed up (on a tractor) and we talked business for a bit and before I left the Dad picked a bunch of sweet corn for me in exchange for fixing the compressor, which I thanked him for.",137 followers,Mark White,1K,769,1.7M,2018,https://www.quora.com/The-human-race-went-through-the-last-100-thousand-years-without-science-or-technology-What-took-it-so-long-to-develop-the-scientific-method-about-400-years-ago-and-evolve-the-human-race-to-where-it-is-today
7,"Socialization.Most people in first world countries prefer to communicate to each other through social media or through either phone calls or messages, increasingly becoming more common with messaging.

This AI will prove itself to be more effective than therapists, obviously more loyal and faithful as spouses, a good friend to talk to and most importantly always available when you need it. Most likely, this form of AI will come out in the form of a robot type called “Androids”, a robot that is completely human-like in shape and physique. Think about this, an Android will never cheat on you, nagging nor talk behind your back, no? Their pros will outweigh the cons, and I wouldn’t be surprised if almost if not everyone prefers to date and marry Androids and have Android friends rather than hang out or marry other humans.The final problem to this would be procreation. In this far-fetched future, the solution would be for female Androids to feature artificial wombs containing eggs from which they can be impregnated from if turned on or off. So this would spell the complete end of human socialization and a new era of either soft slavery (Affectionate AI that doesn’t rebel) or hard slavery (AI Overlords that are ruthless, similar to Skynet ect.)","220,617 followers",Franklin Veaux,1.8K,47.3K,782.9M,2020,https://www.quora.com/The-human-race-went-through-the-last-100-thousand-years-without-science-or-technology-What-took-it-so-long-to-develop-the-scientific-method-about-400-years-ago-and-evolve-the-human-race-to-where-it-is-today
