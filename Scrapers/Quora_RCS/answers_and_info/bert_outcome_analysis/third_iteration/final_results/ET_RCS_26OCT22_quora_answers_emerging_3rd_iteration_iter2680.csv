Others, perhaps better skilled in critical thinking or even just plain curiosity, do search, question and explore for the truth.Advanced technology as you mention may definitely help in that we have information at our fingertips instantaneously. So maybe it does seem a change is happening more quickly but it’s just undoing the damage already done for many.

4,"By “alien race” you probably mean race of intelligent aliens. I'm going to offer instead my opinion on which alien species is most implausible, because one leaps out at me more than all others.Remember in Empire Strikes Back that the Millenium Falcon flew into what it thought was a cave but really was the belly of a massive monster? And that everyone made it clear that only desperate people enter asteroid fields?So what does that big monster usually eat? It can't be spaceships, because hardly anyone goes into asteroid fields.

Maybe it could eat the parasites that were chewing on the Falcon's power lines in the monster's stomach, but it doesn't seem like it, since they lived there unharmed.I suppose it could eat some unnamed species that flies in space and tries to nest in asteroid caves. But it would have to eat a LOT of them to grow so large. A lot of something Star Wars never showed.When you combine it having no known substance to feed on with it needing a lot to eat, the beast seems very, very unlikely. Add to that it had an atmosphere that was in its gut (with fog supported by its inner gasses) and a mouth open to the vacuum of space, with a tunnel between its stomach and mouth that was an unblocked tube big enough for a spaceship to fly through smoothly, and no, there's just no way.While Star Wars showed plenty of improbable creatures, that particular asteroid monster wins my vote as the most implausible life form in all of Star Wars.",0 followers,Andres Castellanos,3.6K,209,228K,2019,https://www.quora.com/Why-did-ancient-civilizations-lose-their-advanced-technologies

One small subtle thing I’ve noticed… when I was a kid I’d see those PSA ads around winter time saying “Winter is coming, make sure you check your tire pressure.” I see them these days except they say “Winter is coming, make sure you get your tire pressure checked.” Did you see the difference? It’s subtle but speaks volumes.

It’s subtle but speaks volumes. Airplane owners are people who do things for themselves. We have to be, because there aren’t many options, and we (do it types) are a dying breed.I just finished my annual inspection on my plane. It cost just over $3,000 and that was with me and my buddy putting in our own labor to open all the inspection panels, change the oil, repack the bearings, change the tires, tubes and brakes, replace the left starter, fix the heating ducts, and clean up various wiring. $1,500 in parts. $1,500 for the inspector to verify it was done right, help re-rig the landing gear (which wasn’t going up all the way), validate the logbooks, airworthiness directives with the FAA (which is just a paperwork exercise), inspect for corrosion and damage and sign the logs. This plane has 6 log books, airframe, avionics, engine 1, engine 2, propeller 1, propeller 2, all of which have compliance items.And that’s a CHEAP annual. If we just left all the work to the mechanics it’d be $15,000 easy. Every. Single. Year. Now, that’s just the inspection & minor repairs, not tax, insurance, hangar rent, major repairs, or databases. Just the GPS database is $1,000 per year for 2 navigation radios.None of that cost includedany fuel or oil. All of that is just to exist, now you want to fly too? Okay, AVGAS is cheap these days at around $4/gallon and we burn around 16–18 gallons per hour to fly 200 miles per hour.So for this kind of cost, to be a viable machine, you need to make about $400,000 per year to keep it from being a burden. I have it as a partnership with another guy who’s 90% a mechanic and that keeps the costs reasonable.But in a nutshell, THAT is why you’ll never, ever, EVER EVER see flying “cars”. Never. Tell me how many people you know that 1) walk around their car and check it out before driving2) periodically replace parts that aren’t worn out but are getting close to being worn out 3) annually dismantle their cars, inspect them inside and out, and then have a certified mechanic verify all the work and 4) document all repairs, inspections, etc. That’s the sort of discipline you’d need from every car owner before the law would allow flying machines.And that doesn’t include pilot training.",9 followers,Andrew McGregor,605,13K,67.2M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Why-did-ancient-civilizations-lose-their-advanced-technologies
8,"Antimatter is not very useful. The only way to create it is using vast amounts of energy - far more than you could get out again. And the amounts of antimatter we can create are measured in hundreds of particles per second - absolutely minute.So enough antimatter is being produced for research into its properties, but no more.I am not sure what you might expect more than this. There are no antimatter mines or anything like that. If there is any antimatter in space, which there probably is not, it is many galaxies away. So there is nothing to abandon or put on hold.","6,091 followers",David Tussey,3.1K,1.8K,37.5M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Why-did-ancient-civilizations-lose-their-advanced-technologies
