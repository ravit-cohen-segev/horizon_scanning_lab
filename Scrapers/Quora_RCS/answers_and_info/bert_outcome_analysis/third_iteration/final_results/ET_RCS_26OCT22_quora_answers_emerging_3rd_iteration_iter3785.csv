Common sense dictates that in a country which has ample rain and freshwater resources, turning to desalination is not the in thing to do. Existing water can be recycled cheaply and reused.

Leaving all these options and going for desalination is not wise. Politicians look for expensive methods because there is money to be made in big ticket projects.

1,"After saving and reusing maximum amount of water that has been received in rainfall, the sea water has been sought for a solution in countries that has desalination plants.

Some, people say this is a talk against technology but as far as my understanding, a technology that cannot serve all the living beings and becoming a mark for human to exploit the nature can’t be a technology.As of now, the desalination plants are not capable enough to give water to all the people living in Tamil nadu and it is definitely not a feasible option looking at the cost and the population. Why to invest in something, that can’t provide a solution for all? Instead, the same amount can be used for desilting and restoration of water bodies efficiently.

Therefore, despite the economic incentives to engage in military actions overseas, Americans will most likely stop short of an actual war with China, and instead engage in brinksmanship and posturing.
