Each one select the strategy fitting the best to the founders and the markets they knows.Hedge funds can pursue a varying degree of strategies including macro, equity, relative value, distressed securities and activism. A macro hedge fund invests in stocks, bonds and currencies in hopes of profiting from changes in macroeconomic variables such as global interest rates and countries’ economic policies. You can see the Forex involve in this part.Few of them have the forex part representing more than 85% of their investment strategy. 2018 was not the best year for them.You can have below a look of the performance for each type of hedge funds.Cheers,Do not hesitate to follow me,",217 followers,Arnab Roy,714,0,0,2018,https://www.quora.com/Which-fund-traded-in-India-focuses-on-emerging-technology-companies-listed-in-the-US
1,"What if I tell you a secret instead - A secret for finding the best mutual funds every single time. Don’t believe me?No issues. But make sure you see below the results I have achieved.32% annualized return and all I did in the last six months is spend only 15 minutes on this.I think you have already realized that you need to listen to me. So let us move forward!So what exactly is my secret strateWhat if I tell you a secret instead - A secret for finding the best mutual funds every single time. Don’t believe me?No issues. But make sure you see below the results I have achieved.32% annualized return and all I did in the last six months is spend only 15 minutes on this.I think you have already realized that you need to listen to me. So let us move forward!So what exactly is my secret strategy?It is a 3-step process:1. I log in to either Value Research or MoneycontrolBeware of experts who tell you that the past performance of a fund is not an indicator of its performance in the future.Ask yourself this. If Mister Sharma’s son has topped in his class last year then is it not likely that he will at the very least, finish inside the top three this year?You don’t need an expert to answer that, do you?There is a sound rationale behind it as well.You see asset-heavy funds often maneuver the market defensively, which hampers its returns. But lighter funds are much more dynamic in comparison and thus are more likely to yield better returns.Source : Value ResearchSo lets say if I had to pick a couple of funds from the list above, I would pick :1. Kotak World Gold FundStart my SIP and relax for the next 6 months.In this very way at the start of 2018, I picked 3 mutual funds which were :1. Aditya Birla Sun Life Small Cap FundI started SIP of Rs 5,000 in each of them for a total of Rs 15,000 every month.Fast forward a year to January 2019 and it was review time and the results were just out of this world, like Usain Bolt.My best performing fund had went DOWN about 3%. While the worst one had plummeted nearly 9% in one year.The actual annualized return (XIRR) was of course even lower.My overall corpus was down around 6% with a net loss of around Rs 11,000. Whereas at the same the Nifty had went up around 28% itself. I was well, devastated.So why on Earth did I tell you that I have a magic formula ?Because I wanted you to show that there is actually NONE.So did I really pick those winning mutual funds or was it all a hoax ?Yes I indeed did.The screenshot you saw at the start of this post is from my portfolio only. But its only now I will teach you my method of scouting outstanding funds.Now to the method :So after my historic failure it was time for me to do some introspection. I needed to understand what went wrong and how can I fix it?But like most people I had no idea where to start from.By then I had heard a lot about the need for assessing ones risk profile as an investor. So I thought lets start by analyzing mine.I asked myself a few basic questions :1. How much money I can put aside monthly which I will most likely not need at least in the next 5 years ?What were the answers ?1. The answer to my first question was Rs. 20,000.I was confident that I can put away Rs. 20,000 every month from my salary and still be able to do fine.Mainly because I had almost no burden on myself and I also live with my family.You see I am a very thrifty person and I cannot simply think of losing my money whatsoever.Yet I decided to be aggressive.Because I figured that no matter how bad the market goes, if I give my investment 10 years to ripen up then they will at the very least give returns similar to a normal fixed deposit.I have that much trust on the stock market.So I bit a bullet and decided to put on 20,000 per month from January this year (5,000 more every month than I did in 2018).So your first task as an investor is to ask yourself two questions :1. How much money you can put aside monthly which you will most likely not need at least in the next 5 years ?The next question was how aggressive would I get ?Professionals call it portfolio risk management.Which essentially boils down to what percentage of your portfolio will be invested in large cap, how much will be in midcap and dare I say how much will you invest in small cap or even penny stocks?Well I figured that since I was basically building my retirement corpus with my mutual fund investments I still have about 25 years.So I came up with a 30-50-20 rule :1. 30% in large cap fundsBut since I had already invested about 1.8 Lac in the last 1 year I needed to figure out what my portfolio distribution currently looked like.At that time it was 5% large cap, 40% midcap and 55% small cap.No wonder since small cap stocks did not perform well in 2018 my portfolio had tanked.I had found the reason of my failure.But now was the time to fix it.So how did I fix it ?I needed to reach 30% in large cap from 5%.Which meant that I had to invest much more in large caps than I wil...","246,856 followers",Dushka Zapata,1.5K,8.5K,232.5M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Which-fund-traded-in-India-focuses-on-emerging-technology-companies-listed-in-the-US

3,"I have a working proof of concept prototype of a Centrifugal propeller. A video of it is posted on YouTube. I am within a couple of weeks from having a practical purpose prototype that will actually lift into the air. The Centrifugal Propeller will replace all jet engines, rockets, and most air and marine propellers. It will also be used for lifting purposes both commercially and domestically. It has no speed limit in outer space because it will continually accelerate.",0 followers,Lucas Martin,6.4K,65,4.2M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Which-fund-traded-in-India-focuses-on-emerging-technology-companies-listed-in-the-US

5,"More likely, what happens is: some innovative filmmaker working with zero budget, like a Robert Rodriguez or Kevin Smith, makes a modestly successful independent movie that impresses Hollywood with the director’s talent and uncompromising vision (uncompromising because the director didn’t have to answer to financial backers or water down the movie for commercial reasons in order to recoup a large investment). Even more likely, rather than a zero budget, it’s a modest nonzero budget, like the early films of Quentin Tarantino, Christopher Nolan, Chloe Zhao, or Taika Waititi.

Even more likely, rather than a zero budget, it’s a modest nonzero budget, like the early films of Quentin Tarantino, Christopher Nolan, Chloe Zhao, or Taika Waititi. Hollywood promptly signs the talented-on-the-cheap director to direct the next $200 million superhero sequel. Resulting movie shows few flashes of the individual style and personality that got the director noticed in the first place, because the stakes were much higher and the production much more risk-averse. The resulting mediocrity is enough either to send the director back to the minor leagues, or else, like Tarantino and Nolan, they become a brand themselves and therefore don’t have to do work-for-hire franchise films, but are still heavily dependent on the Hollywood studio system and its capital to make films. The system remains undisturbed, having co-opted any filmmaker talented enough to offer any real challenge to The Way Things Are Done In This Town.Look, there is actually a viable, zero-budget film industry that rivals Hollywood. It exists on YouTube and TikTok. It’s not making feature-length films, it’s not releasing movies theatrically, and its top talents aren’t household names. But it’s viable in the sense that its creators are niche-famous enough to monetize their work and make a good living.","46,124 followers",Steven Haddock,4K,25.6K,343.5M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Which-fund-traded-in-India-focuses-on-emerging-technology-companies-listed-in-the-US
6,"No, because there’s no money in it — not reliably, at any rate.Yes, directors like Robert Townsend and Don Coscarelli largely self-financed their breakout films and the actors either worked for nothing or very little, but those are “Get Your Foot in the Door” movies.

To work, and keep working, for very little money means you have no budget to promote your productions so there’s far less chance of reaching their potential audiences. Yes, if you do a really interesting first film you’ll get a lot of free press from film critics and writers wanting to tap in on The Next Big Thing, but if you keep doing stuff at that same level they’ll lose interest quickly.The kinds of movies that stand the best chance with little promotion are genre pieces and exploitation movies, all of which have built-in audiences. It’s why during the home video boom there were so many crappy SF, horror and action films put out, because there was a built-in market for them — if you had a completed film or video production with 10 - 15 minutes of grabber content front-loaded, then you stood a good chance of selling your project. If you turned out enough of them, you became a reliable producer — but you weren’t “challenging Hollywood”, because as soon as Hollywood notices your movie made a lot of money for a small budget they’ll start to turn their own out! (That’s what the FRIDAY THE 13th series is — a major studio, Paramount, making bank on cheapo sleazy slasher movies they really hate to admit they produced.)Exploitation films usually cost a lot less and have a lot smaller audience (because they’re not for general audiences, at all), but if you can produce them cheaply enough you can probably find a market for them.
