2,"Several incremental advancements  in technology, mostly focused on either cost reduction, weight reduction (often both), or an increase in access to a particular component.Take batteries for example.  I remember a decade or two ago, the best batteries were NiCad and NiMH, which were too heavy to allow for small hovering drones (fixed-wind aircraft were fine however).  Today, we have lightweight and energy dense Lithium Polymer (Lithium Cobalt Oxide) that can provide enough power while being light enough to lift its own weight in a hovering drone.

I remember a decade or two ago, the best batteries were NiCad and NiMH, which were too heavy to allow for small hovering drones (fixed-wind aircraft were fine however).  Today, we have lightweight and energy dense Lithium Polymer (Lithium Cobalt Oxide) that can provide enough power while being light enough to lift its own weight in a hovering drone.  The battery weight issue is actually part of an overarching challenge to electric flight, it's why we're only just starting to see all-electric human-scale aircraft.Hovering drones rely on an electrical stabilisation system, which needs accelerometers and gyroscopes, only in the last decade, and thanks in  part to the smart-phone industry, has low cost MEMS accelerometers and  gyroscopes been available, necessary for the stabilisation and AHRS  system in drones.  I remember only 5 years ago, a good MEMS gyro/accelerometer system would cost over $100, a decade ago it may have cost thousands, today we're talking less than $5.Along with the sensors needed for stability, the drones also need some processing power to calculate its orientation and process the sensor data.  Microcontrollers have been around for a long time, but it's somewhat thanks to the maker movement that have made access to small, cheap, but powerful microcontrollers more accessible to hobbyists.  The barrier to entry to developing with these systems was lowered.Hovering drones also need very powerful motors.  But powerful motors tend to be heavy.  It's actually relatively recently that small high torque (direct-drive) permanent magnet brushless motors have become available to hobbyists.  Maybe a decade ago, the best you could do (unless you were prepared to fork out a lot of money) were brushed motors with relatively weak iron magnets.Along with the motors are the high power density switching semiconductors.  Hovering drones use a lot of power, and this power has to be controlled (necessary due to the brushless motors).  Only in the last couple of decades have FET technologies achieved high enough  power densities and efficiencies to allow miniaturisation of high-power  rectifiers needed to run high-torque brushless motors.Finally, also thanks in part to the smartphone industry, but also the advancements to the GPS system (the US Air Force flipping a switch to enable higher accuracies for civilians; the launching of additional GPS satellites; the availability of SBAS systems, etc.) that has allowed higher accuracies and cheaper GPS modules.  This is necessary for autonomous drones.So despite there being no single technological breakthroughs that made drones suddenly possible, it's a result of the compound effects of many incremental improvements in technology.","5,990 followers",Jens Böttiger,566,2.6K,17.6M,2015,https://www.quora.com/How-do-you-think-the-emerging-technology-of-drones-will-advance-within-the-next-100-years
3,"Yet another iteration to this question, which is clearly one of the most commonly asked on Quora:Why does the US give ‘financial support’ for Israel?The US government has decided that spending in excess of $120 billion per year to promote its geopolitical goals is worth it. And the $3 billion of credits that is given to Israel against purchase of US military hardware is chump change compared to what it actually spends on other allies.David Vine, a professor at American University, states inYet another iteration to this question, which is clearly one of the most commonly asked on Quora:Why does the US give ‘financial support’ for Israel?The US government has decided that spending in excess of $120 billion per year to promote its geopolitical goals is worth it. And the $3 billion of credits that is given to Israel against purchase of US military hardware is chump change compared to what it actually spends on other allies.David Vine, a professor at American University, states inWhat does the US government get from those credits?While the Israel-haters would like to present the US military aid package as some kind of ‘no strings attached’ gift, the reality is more of an exchange of goods and services, as well as the fulfillment of promises made by the US in peace treaties.Containment of Soviet/Russian InfluenceOne telling point is that the US did not support Israel militarily until after 1967, and economically perhaps not until the 1980’s. The Cold War dominated US geopolitics, spurring endless operations to contain Soviet influence in nearly every corner of the globe. Only when Israel proved itself as a worthwhile adversary to the Soviet client states that surrounded it in 1967 did the US support begin.Although the Cold War is over, in many ways the US behavior towards Russia is similar to that of the USSR. In the following chart, note how the nations who receive the most US aid are adjacent to Russia and her allies (Syria, Iran, Hizbullah).United States foreign aid - WikipediaA US aircraft carrier in a troubled regionIsrael exists in a highly strategic and yet highly unstable region. And yet even the most ardent Israel-hater must agree that Israel can be counted upon as a most reliable US ally. US Secretary of State Alexander Haig likened Israel to “the largest American aircraft carrier in the world that cannot be sunk, does not carry even one American soldier, and is located in a critical region for American national security.” It could be added that this ‘aircraft carrier’ does not cost nearly as much as the floating variety (carriers are hugely expensive to build and maintain). It could and perhaps should be noted that the US does now operate a very small base in Israel, with about 100 personnel. Israel philosophically finds it distasteful to have a foreign base on its soil, but the size and benefits of this mini-base were enough for it to make this one exception.The cost of maintaining a US military presence in Germany and Japan, very wealthy nations which exist in much less volatile or strategic regions, is estimated to cost US taxpayers at least $20 billion per year for each nation. Israel is quite a bargain in comparison.Balance of military aidUS provides economic and military aid to several nations who exhibit lukewarm acceptance of Israel’s existence if not outright hostility. Israel’s immediate neighbors figure large on the list of US aid, as do the terror centers of Pakistan and Afghanistan. The Camp David Accords, which provides many geopolitical benefits to the US, promised Egypt substantial economic and military aid. If one wants to be seen as fair and balanced, equal assistance must be given to both sides.Camp David Accords - WikipediaFurthermore, US has sold advanced military hardware worth tens of billions of dollars to wealthy Arab petro-states who have regularly demanded Israel’s destruction in the past. If you want to make the sale and yet keep Israel as an ally, you have to provide some reciprocity.Boost domestic defense industryWith new Obama regulations, 100% of US aid to Israel is spent on buying equipment from the US. This is distinctly in contrast to US military spending in Germany and Japan, for example. In those nations much of the military budget is spent locally, aiding the local economy much more than that of the US.Control of the sale of Israeli weaponry to US rivalsIsraeli high tech weaponry is valued throughout the world, and sought after by many nations, including some which are not exactly friendly to US interests. To exert this specific influence over Israel, which also affects Israeli GDP, some incentive must be provided by the US.US acts over Israeli arms sales to ChinaIntelligence SharingA recent Trump scandal in the last few months revealed a bit of the reliance of the US intelligence community on the Mossad. Trump revealed to Russia some details of a Mossad operation whereby Israeli agents penetrated Islamic State and discovered their plan to plant bombs in laptop computers taken onboard commercial aircraft bound for the US.It is clear that the US relies on Mossad for access to crucial information, and this has been the case for decades. George Keagan, former head of U.S. Air Force Intelligence, said that “Israel is worth five CIAs.”Is Israel an asset or a burden to our country?Application to a recent news item: when an Israeli F16 was shot down by a barrage of Syrian anti-aircraft missiles, the details of that confrontation is of huge importance to the US military. The US can expect to get extensive details that will help plan future potential interactions with Russian developed systems.Joint military hardware developmentIsrael has a unique position in its cooperation with the US on development of military hardware. Many projects, such as the Arrow missile, are developed together to the advantage and cost savings of both.Arrow (Israeli missile) - WikipediaFurthermore, Israel is a significant test bed for US military hardware. It was mostly Israeli-flown but US-built F-15 fighter jets that accrued the F-15’s enviable record.From“The first kill by an F-15 was scored by Israeli Air Force aceFurthermore, much information about the latest Soviet technologies were received during Israel’s many wars to defend its existence.Safe StorageIsrael is the only truly reliable location in the region for the storage of US military hardware if US needed to get that material to a nearby theatre of operation quickly.War reserve stock - WikipediaDefending Shipping LanesArguably one of the most important roles for the sole global superpower is to maintain the safety of the world’s shipping lanes. Much of what can be said in praise of Pax Romana and Pax Britannia was their defense of trade routes, and the increase in global wealth because of that. In this regard, Israel is a great help to the US, considering its location near to the Horn of Africa and one of the most notorious shipping bottlenecks accessed by Somali pirates.Israeli guards repel Somali pirate attack on cruise shipIsrael: A Strategic Asset for the United StatesOmnipotent AIPAC lobbyists?In spite of all of this, Israel haters love to single out AIPAC as having immense influence in Washington. Even though it is clear that AIPAC is hardly the most powerful lobby for a foreign nation in Washington, we could also look to the success of AIPAC in lobbying congress to vote against Obama’s Iran deal. AIPAC failed completely. Omnipotent? Perhaps not.Here is a list of the funding of foreign lobbyists:Foreign Lobby Watch“In 2010, foreign governments spent approximately $460 million on lobbyingFrom:Where is the outrage about South Korea and Japan, who spend far more than Israel in lobbying the US government?

But when it comes to actually doing this, the industry is seriously lacking.Shipments are lost, damaged, or delayed too often because of confusion in the chain of custody. For example, many companies have not yet digitized, so their documents must be faxed or scanned. Due to this antiquated process, there’s a high risk of “pen and paper changes,” when someone alters a document, and no one knows who did it, or why it was changed.Even tech-savvy shipping companies can run into trouble. If they’re part of a longer chain of delivery, digital businessesThis causes a lack of trust. If a shipment is lost, you can potentially lose millions of dollars worth of inventory. Needless to say, that’s a gigantic problem. But blockchain has the potential to making shipping more transparent, reliable, and secure.This is a net good that stands to benefit everyone involved in shipping, from warehouses, drivers, customers, and regulators.Here are three ways this technology can usher in a new era of transparency for the industry.1. Blockchain Creates An Immutable Ledger.Blockchain will allow us to easily track changes along the chain of custody. What was modified, who did it, when and why did they do it?The key feature behind this ability to increase transparency is hash functions. A hash is like a mathematical fingerprint, no two hashes are the same. If someone makes a change to a document—even just adding a period, for example—the hash will reflect this. Data is stored alongside a record of who made changes and when, which makes it difficult for someone to tamper with it.Let me give you a real-world example:When independent truck drivers hitch up with major carriers, they often have to make handoffs between trucks. Part of the problem is that many different companies own many different trucks. So, when a driver needs to transport a pallet from Chicago to Miami, he may be dealing with several shippers and vehicles. The chain of command is long, and there’s plenty of opportunities for things to go wrong. With blockchain and hashes, though,This brings some much-needed visibility into the process. And it can also work in conjunction with existing technologies to increase transparency.2. It Offers Synergy With Existing Tracking Systems.Blockchain is certainly revolutionary, but it shouldn’t exist in a vacuum.If you merge Internet of Things (IoT) tracking technology with the distributed ledger, you get an even clearer picture of every step of the shipping process. This will help us determine where and when problems occur.There are so many moving parts, from trucks and warehouses to shippers and drivers. Using blockchain with existing tracking systems will put all the information from the various actors in one visible spot. Let’s say you receive a damaged product. By using IOT with blockchain, you can determine if a certain truck on the route performed hard braking, when that happened in transit, and which driver was responsible for it.Layering IOT on top of blockchain also comes in handy when transporting perishable goods. Think about food, for example. When refrigerated trucks are moving consumables to other refrigerated trucks and warehouses, you’ll be able to track the temperature while the items are in transit.Besides limiting spoilage, this information will increase safety and accountability throughout the entire supply chain.3. It Allows for Secure Oversight and Accountability.International shipments can be problematic for regulators, who have to contend with missing paperwork, documents that don’t arrive in time, and fraud. In the U.S. alone, there’s about $30 billion of reported cargo fraud and theft each year. Because many companies don’t report this, the actual number is much higher.But with blockchain, shippers can provide regulators access to a private key—allowing them to immediately confirm that all the documentation is there and track any edits made. This increases efficiency, for sure, but it also minimizes fraud. Companies who try to dodge customs by under-declaring an item will no longer be able to fool regulators.This oversight and accountability, then, will have positive effects on the economy. Regulators will be able to more accurately assess duties, tariffs, and fines—and the proper taxes will be collected more easily.It doesn’t stop here: the benefits go beyond economic. Using blockchain in the shipping industry will also make us significantly safer. Think about all the dangerous items that could be included in a shipment but not declared. Blockchain technology, combined with sensors that weigh and analyze the contents of cargo, allows the shipping industry to be transparent. We will be able to say with certainty: this is what’s in the cargo and here’s the ledger as proof.Shipping and logistics is an old industry, but we’re already seeing a lot of interest in adopting blockchain technology to increase transparency. This will benefit everyone and bring positive changes including cutting down on paperwork, improving tracking of shipments, and reducing fraud.",22 followers,Nishchal Arora,9.5K,131,3.7M,2019,https://www.quora.com/How-do-you-think-the-emerging-technology-of-drones-will-advance-within-the-next-100-years
