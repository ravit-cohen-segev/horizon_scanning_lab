3,"Humans aren’t physically inferior to most other mammals. Just physicallyOur superior manual dexterity and high endurance more than make up for less relative raw burst power and immediate speed.And we are actually bigger and stronger than most of them.We aren’t the only species with these cognitive abilities, just the one in which they are the most sophisticated.Evolution is a divergent process. In such a process, for every class of adaption",18 followers,Joshua Walters,2.3K,259,10.8M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Why-are-humans-the-only-species-to-have-evolved-to-our-level-of-technology
4,"I think it goes without saying, but this is an extremely hard question to answer.Though, a few of my own opinions.Moore’s law (the law that states processing power will double every 2 years) has been slowing down for years now. Due to limitations on the quantum scale, the manufacturing process can only be made so small, we’re hitting that limit.As a result, though in the past we’ve seen technological advancements primarily come from the rapid increase in computing power, in the future this won’t be the case.Instead, we’re going to have to improve our utilization of available processing power.II think it goes without saying, but this is an extremely hard question to answer.Though, a few of my own opinions.Moore’s law (the law that states processing power will double every 2 years) has been slowing down for years now.

Now bear in mind, my understanding of quantum mechanics is limitedIn standard computing, we use bits, with 0’s and 1’s, quantum mechanics uses ‘qubits’ which can be any combination of 0 and 1.Now, should quantum mechanics progress at the rate companies like google claim (double exponential, as opposed to exponential for standard computing), we could be set for a quantum revolutionBut ultimately, I can’t predict the future, only time will tell.",35 followers,Noah Green,578,0,0,2020,https://www.quora.com/Why-are-humans-the-only-species-to-have-evolved-to-our-level-of-technology

Filipinos were already aware of therapeutic properties and medicinal values of plants. Filipinos were already engage in farming, poultry and use of trees for building homes.With the Spanish colonization, Filipinos started to learn and got education on science and technology. Spanish has introduced formal education and founded scientific institution.The study of medicine was given priority in schools and engineering and constructions to build infrastructures such as, houses, building, ports, roads and bridges were introduced.During American colonization further studies were made in the field of medicine, engineering, architectures, sciences, agriculture, etc. On July 01, 1901 Bureau of Government Laboratories was established and placed under the Department of Interior.In 1905, The Bureau of Science was established and later in 1946 it was replaced by Institute of Science to address the lack of information which were required in country’s industries.In 1958, President Carlos P. Garcia through the Philippine Congress passed Science Act that established the National Science Development Board.From 1968 to 1986, the government of President Ferdinand Marcos has given more importance to science and technology. He declared that the advancement of science and technology shall have priority in the national development. During his era a number of institutions to advance science and technology were created. Some of these institutions are as follows;President Corazon Aquino era was also aggressive in the development of science and technology in the country and established the following;President Ramos and Estrada have passed the Science and Technology Agenda for national Development and Estrada the Philippine Clean Air Act and the electronic commerce act.The current administration of President Duterte has encourage the repatriation or return of Filipino Scientists from all over the world to help in various health issues such as the cure for dengue, etc.",26 followers,Balaji Viswanathan,516,5.6K,427.2M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Why-are-humans-the-only-species-to-have-evolved-to-our-level-of-technology
7,"If you are talking about ‘mainstream’ education, that which is provided by state systems across the western world, and forms the compulsory curriculum for 5–18 year old people, then technology has been incorporated quite substantially in that curriculum, teaching aids, media presentation the use of computer networks; most schools have their own LAN/WAN implemented, and also limited internet access.The emphasis here is on high levels ofIf you are talking about ‘mainstream’ education, that which is provided by state systems across the western world, and forms the compulsory curriculum for 5–18 year old people, then technology has been incorporated quite substantially in that curriculum, teaching aids, media presentation the use of computer networks; most schools have their own LAN/WAN implemented, and also limited internet access.The emphasis here is on high levels ofFor example, social media, Wikipedia are both strictly forbidden, as is access to independent education projects and alternative sources of information.As with most legacy establishments, the legitimacy of social media and other sources of pluralistic information is labeled ‘fake news’ or invalid.We have today a growing warfare between ideologies, and the open source world of education has grown in sophistication, with many independent educators presenting resources and training courses that might not comply with official forms of curriculum.For example, the ‘Home Schooling’ industry has seen an explosion of independent teachers and educators offering bespoke types of courses, which suit different factions, religions, and political/social ideas. Parents and guardians of children, and teenagers can choose to present these alternative types of education for their offspring, and charges, and as long as they also stick with the ‘compulsory’ curriculum, for the Core subjects, their choices are not interfered with in many cases.However, the education establishment forms an important part of the ‘social reproduction’ process, which in simple terms means producing citizens who are going to comply and agree with the authority and ideology of the mainstream society, so the type of curriculum being taught to children is monitored closely.Now, in real terms, the only aspects of education institutions which give them authority, is this collective agreement in democratic societies that government manages education, and boards of investors and other underwriters who purchase universities and other tertiary institutions, these form the power base of specific groups in our society, if you are in control of education, you naturally have a great deal of influence and effect on social outcomes.The World Wide Web has enabled the mass distribution of education from all kinds of sources. Independent education, and alternative education are growing in popularity.People can now gain all kinds of skill sets and abilities from these alternative, and private enterprise education projects.Social media offers us an extremely powerful means to build learning communities, and support groups, and this is being ignored by many academics, who persist with accusing social media as being ‘toxic’ or harmful.I think we are poised to see a major confrontation between ideologically based education establishments (Yes, the mainstream is ideologically biased) and this ‘Open Source’ and alternative education community.Today we definitely are immersed in an ‘Information War’, a certain independent media personality is bang on the money with that one.While technologyAs an adult educator, working with language, and technologies I am aware of this turbulent environment, we are amidst great change, much of this is healthy, but also controversial to many people.",4 followers,Matthew Bates,1.4K,9.8K,293.1M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Why-are-humans-the-only-species-to-have-evolved-to-our-level-of-technology
8,"It has. Kids are given calculators at 7, so they can no longer understand numerical relationships or do math for themselves. Since they have keyboards, they are no longer taught cursive, and are allowed to depend on the keyboard instead. Since they have online search engines, they no longer think they need books, and library use is way, way down in schools, colleges and universities.
