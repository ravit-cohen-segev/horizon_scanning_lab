Every owner of a computer or smart phone now has years of emails, calendar events, documents, songs, pictures, videos, messages, apps and more that have to be continuously browsed or searched, and viewed.  What's more, the web has become our window onto the world, a great tumultuous ocean of almost unordered unstructured text and images.  Complicating things still, it's essential that we be able to access allof  this in different ways to serve different purposes at different times -- sorting by date/time, location, text labels, image content, data type, etc.  And sometimes you don't have a clear handle to use to retrieve what you want.  (""Which movies starred John Wayne in a business suit?"")You need clever heuristics to navigate through all this stuff.  You start by describing patterns of data (semantics) that interest you, and then you match them via search, and then browse through the results.  The bigger the data or the more vague the search criteria, the smarter or more discriminating the pattern filter needs to be.  That requires AI.Improving the process of devising and matching patterns requires trial and error.  You need to iteratively tune the pattern to find positives and reject negatives (and noise).  That's learning.Of course, once you can find useful patterns (the signal), you'll want to track them as they change (trends), watch changes to individual examples of a pattern (like consumer behavior) or collectives (sectors / demographics).

I say this as an AI researcher who works on these problems and I see how truly difficult they are. We can, and will solve some of the problems but we are a long way from AIs that can match human minds. An AI that plays Go better than humans is buildable because the game is a closed small universe.

Each of it’s enabling technologies themselves are massive forces of change—AI, robotics, drones, computer vision, sensors, etc.—all in various stages of exponential growth, having crossed vital gestation thresholds.The automation of makingAs the industrial and information era developed, the economics of making increasingly came to be determined by the cost of people who manned the factory floors. This is changing.Co-botsHow long before we flip the term toScaling cheap labor is easy. Scaling bots needs some serious capital (in the medium term until they get commoditized). “Making” at scale will consolidate even further into the hands of large players with appetite for big investments.All this doesn’t mean that countries that built on low-cost, scale production model like China need to necessarily lose out. China is investing towards making its factories automated and building them at scale. Yet, it still trails some other countries that had a greater motivation to automate earlier, like Japan or Germany. The era of throwing more men to get something done is getting over.But it isn’t just factories. Fast food chains will be closely watching when the cost of burger flippers and automated serving robots dips below minimum wage. Agriculture is already getting increasingly automated with drones monitoring the crops, precision control systems determining nutrients and automated seeders and harvesters.What does all this mean? We will have a period of pain and shock as jobs are lost, economic dynamics are shifted and wealth distribution gets skewed further. New economic models and frameworks may need to be considered? Is free-market capitalism the right model going forward — it’s been tolerated as long as the trickle down feels just about enough to justify its existence. But the chasm between the rich top tier and others is growing wider by the day. New skills and jobs will rise. New power centers will emerge.MovingSelf-driving individual cars may yet take some time (perhaps a decade down?) but increasinglyThe result:Also significantly, goods will increasingly move autonomously. The robot-led fulfillment centers of Amazon and those in China aren’t showcasing a far future. They are going to alter the process of logistics and distribution quite quickly. FedEx wants to have a handful of pilots streer a fleet of hundreds of flights from a control center. Amazon and UPS wants to use drones and autonomous driving systems for deliveries.And it will get cheaper. A significant portion of any product’s cost includes the costs of warehousing and distribution attributable to human labor and its inefficiencies (handling and driving). An automated supply chain will bring down the costs of moving goods (including reducing loses due to mishandling, pilferage, etc.).If extended to its ideal end state, this will potentiallyBut on the flip side, a consolidation of ownership to big companies will increasingly place us as puppets in the hands of a few who know more and more about us and increasingly dictate how we lead our lives.ThinkingAutomation is coming toAssociated press claims to generate automated reports for small sports events that match the skill level of an experienced writer. Robotic arms, which aid surgeons today, could eventually take over when their precision is better than the best human surgeon.

Automation will create new jobs ranging fromThe drop in costs and a plug-and-play ecosystem will enable enterprising entrepreneurs to build new businesses on top that offerWill all this free up people for more ‘life’? I am not so sure. The industrial and information era only ate up more and more of our time with ‘work’. Perhaps it’s a trend that’s set to continue. But, hopefully, work will get more meaningful and less mundane.Pain isn’t avoidable. Millions will struggle to cope. Nearly 50% of the jobs in the United states are at risk. In India, it’s nearly 2/3rds of all jobs. It’s not just laborers, drivers and factory workers. The middle class will also be impacted - office workers, security guards, doctors, lawyers, etc.Governments need to get creative and smart to manage this transition.

The world is going to change the way it acts: How financial institutions work?, How organizations conduct business?, or How governments govern? Everything is going to change, all because ofThe technology likely to have the greatest impact on the next few decades has arrived. And it's not social media.It's not big data. It's not robotics. It's not even AI. You'll be surprised to learn that it's the underlying technology of digital currencies like Bitcoin. It's called the Blockchain.— Don TapscottIt's aBlockchain technologyThe Blockchain has the ability to make the organizations that use it transparent, democratic, decentralized, efficient and secure.The Blockchain is likely to disrupt many Industries in the coming five to ten years. These are some of the industries it's already disrupting.1. Banking and PaymentsSome people say that the Blockchain will do to banking what the internet did to media. Blockchain technology can be used to give access to financial services to billions of people around the world including those in countries who don't have access to traditional banking. Technologies like Bitcoin allow anyone to send money across borders almost instantly in very low fees.2. CybersecurityAlthough the Blockchain ledger is public, the data is verified and encrypted using advanced cryptography. This way the data is less prone to being hacked or changed without authorization. The Blockchain eliminates the need for middlemen making it more efficient than many legacy systems in cyber security.3. Supply Chain ManagementWith Blockchain technology, transactions can be documented in a permanent decentralized record and monitored securely and transparently. This can greatly reduce time delays and human mistakes. It can also be used to ––monitor costs labour and even waste in emissions at every point in the supply chain. This has serious implications for understanding and controlling the real environmental impact of products. The Blockchain can also be used to verify the authenticity or fair trade status of products by tracking them from their origin. Some Blockchain start-ups working in this sector are Providence, Fluent, SKU chain and Block Verify.4. ForecastingThe blockchain is set to change the entire approach to research consulting analysis and forecasting. Online platforms like Augur are looking to create global decentralized prediction markets. These technologies can be used to place and monitor bets on anything from sports to stocks to elections in a decentralized way.5. Networking and Internet of ThingsSamsung and IBM are using Blockchain technology for new concepts called Adept which will create a decentralized network of IOT devices operating like a public ledger for a large number of devices. It would eliminate the need for a central location to handle communications between them. The devices would be able to communicate to each other directly to update software, manage bugs and monitor energy usage.6. InsuranceThe global insurance market is based on trust management. The blockchain is a new way of managing trust and can be used to verify many types of data in insurance contracts like the insured person's identity so-called Oracles can be used to integrate real world data with Blockchain smart contracts. This technology is very useful for any types of insurance that rely on real-world data, for example, crop insurance. Eternities, one Blockchain project that is building tools that are useful in the insurance industry.7. Private transport and RidesharingThe Blockchain can be used to create decentralized versions of peer-to-peer ridesharing apps allowing both car owners and users to arrange terms and conditions in a secure way with of third party providers. Startups working in this area include Arcade City and la ‘zooz. Use of built-in e-wallet can allow car owners to automatically pay for parking highway tolls and electricity top-ups to the vehicle. UBS, ZF and Innogy are some of the startups developing Blockchain-based e-wallets.8. Cloud storageData on a centralized server is inherently vulnerable to hacking data loss or human error. Blockchain technology allows cloud storage to be more secure and robust against attack. Storj is one example of a cloud storage network using Blockchain technology.9. CharityCommon complaints in charity space include inefficiency and corruption which prevent money from reaching those who are meant to have it. Using Blockchain technology to track donations can let you be sure that your money is going to end up in the right hands. Bitcoin-based charities like Bitgive foundation use Blockchain secured and transparent distributed ledger to let donors see that the intended party has received the funds.10. VotingProbably one of the most important areas of society that Blockchain will disrupt is voting. The US election is not the first time certain parties were accused of rigging election results. Blockchain technology can be used for voter registration and identity verification and electronic vote counting to ensure that only legitimate votes are counted and no votes are changed or removed creating an immutable publicly viewable ledger of recorded votes. It would be a massive step forward in making elections more fair and democratic. Democracy earth and follow my vote are two start-ups aiming to disrupt democracy itself by creating Blockchain-based online voting systems for the government.11. GovernmentGovernment systems are often slow and opaque and prone to corruption. Implementing Blockchain-based systems can significantly reduce bureaucracy and increase security efficiency and transparency of government. Dubai, for example, is aiming to put all its government documents on the Blockchain by 2020.12. Public BenefitsThe public benefits system is another sector that suffers from slowness and bureaucracy. Blockchain technology can help assess verify and distribute welfare or unemployment benefits in a much more streamlined and secure way. Govcoin is a UK based company that is helping the government to distribute public benefits using Blockchain technology. The Blockchain is also a good contender for implementing a basic income. Circles is a project working on developing a Blockchain-based technology for implementing a universal basic income.13. HealthcareAnother industry that relies on so many legacy systems and is ripe for disruption is healthcare. One of the challenges hospitals face is the lack of a secure platform to store and share data. They are also often victims of hacking because of outdated infrastructure. Blockchain technology can allow hospitals to safely store data like medical records and share with the authorized professionals or patients. This will improve data security and can even help improved accuracy and speed of diagnosis. Gem and Tierion is two startups that are working on disrupting the current healthcare data space.14. Energy managementEnergy management has been a highly centralized industry for a long time. Energy producers and users cannot buy directly from each other and have to go through the public grid or trusted private intermediary. Transactive grid is a start-up using the etherium Blockchain that allows customers to buy and sell energy directly from each other in a peer-to-peer way.15. Online musicSeveral Blockchain start-ups are coming up with ways for musicians to get paid directly from their fans without giving up large percentages of sales platforms or record companies. Smart-contracts can also be used to automatically solve licensing issues and better catalogue songs with respective creators. Mycelia and ujomusic are two start-ups creating Blockchain-based solutions in the music industry.16. RetailWhen you shop you trust the retail system of the store or the marketplace. Decentralized Blockchain-based retail utilities work differently. They connect buyers and sellers without middlemen and associated fees. Sorry, Amazon. In these cases, trust comes from smart contract systems. The security of exchanges and built-in reputation management systems. Two startups disrupting the retail space are openbazar and ob1.17. Real estateSome of the issues in buying and selling real estate are bureaucracy, lack of Transparency, fraud, and mistakes in public records. Using Blockchain technology can speed up transactions by reducing the need for paper-based record keeping. It can also help with tracking verifying ownership ensuring the accuracy of documents and transferring property deeds. Ubiquity is a Blockchain secured platform for real estate recordkeeping that is an alternative to legacy paper-based systems.18. CrowdfundingCrowdfunding has become a popular method of fundraising for new startups and projects in recent years. Crowdfunding platforms exist to create trust between project creators and supporters but they also charge high fees. In Blockchain-based crowdfunding, trust is created through smart contracts and online reputation systems which removes the need for a middleman. New projects can raise funds by releasing their own tokens that represent value and can later be exchanged for products services or cash. Many Blockchain projects have now raised millions of dollars through such token sales. Although it's still early days and the regulatory future of Blockchain-based crowdfunding is uncertain. It's an area that holds a lot of promises19. Your industryIf your industry deals with data or transactions of any kind it's likely a field that can be disrupted by Blockchain technology. Space is wide open and the opportunities are many.Hope you guys will not just think of revolutionizing the world using Blockchain Technology but will also do something about it.Peace!!References:",UNKNOWN,Valerio Cietto,677,2.4K,9.1M,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-will-be-the-next-three-biggest-disruptive-technologies-in-our-lifespans-and-why
