In Uganda, goat milk was generally not considered palatable, possibly due to the abundance of cow milk, so we never milked goats. He would sell a couple of them to supplement income from other produce to send his children to school. He also reared a couple of chickens, more as a hobby.The farm produces more than he can consume. He sells the surplus to afford such essential services as kerosene (recently upgraded to solar), soap, sugar (at his age he no longer takes sugar, he uses honey — doctor’s orders).Scattered across the farm are sugarcane (for eating, not for making sugar) and fruit trees (guava, mango, pawpaw, avocado, orange, passion fruit, pineapple). He drinks fresh juice from mangoes and passion fruit. As is evident, everything here is on a subsistence basis, but very organic. He has done this for the past 75 years.He had eleven children, my mother being his first born. He sent all of them to school, saw eight of them through college. He sold at least two cows, some goats and some produce each school term to send his children to school.I went to live at grandfather’s place when I was 5 years old. I left when I was 14 (my family lived in an urban area). I learnt how to farm, milk cows, tether goats, harvest fruits (by climbing the fruit tree) and harvesting honey (at night using smoke).Why the long story?My grandfather, just like millions of other Africans that live like him, is considered poor. He rarely holds money, and he rarely needs it. He produces most of what he needs. But using the standard World Bank/IMF description of ‘poor’, my grandfather is poor. I live in the city and earn about USD 12,000 a year after tax, which in Uganda is a decent salary. But I can hardly match my grandfather in terms of providing for my family with fresh milk, fresh food and fresh fruits.This is one thing most people that watch International media do not know about Africa: not all Africans are poor, many simply live differently than you.(Image source:Ugandan farmer riding bananas from his farm to the market.

But, I learned some valuable lessons.Lesson 1: Most people know that on Windows, if you press the Shift key 5 times, the computer emits an ear-bleeding screech, then displays the following window:This window is Sticky Keys, an accessibility feature that lets you press and release keys like Ctrl, Alt, Shift instead of holding them down to make inputting key combos easier.What happens when you press Shift 5 times is WindowsI'm not sure how legal this is, so don't tell anyone.So in freshman or sophomore year of high school (year 9 or 10), I got banned from using the computer lab for doing this. But, I learned some valuable lessons.Lesson 1: Most people know that on Windows, if you press the Shift key 5 times, the computer emits an ear-bleeding screech, then displays the following window:This window is Sticky Keys, an accessibility feature that lets you press and release keys like Ctrl, Alt, Shift instead of holding them down to make inputting key combos easier.What happens when you press Shift 5 times is Windows will try to find an executable file named sethc.exe in the System32 folder and run it.Remember that.Lesson 2: Another really useful feature on Windows machines is they have a recovery mode you can enter before the computer boots up all the way. Usually you have to either hold down F2, press enter 10 times, do a backflip, to the right now y'all, one hop this time, and it will enter recovery mode. This is mainly for trying to restore Windows to a previous version, or recovering information if the computer breaks.Remember that, too.Lesson 3: When you use Windows, even if you don't have to enter a password, you are signed in as a user. Each user has specific access rights and privileges. For example, Administrators usually have more access to system files and settings than regular users do.Ok, so here's where I got in trouble.I'd come into the computer lab during lunch to dink around, play flash games, etc. because I didn't have a computer at home. Eventually, I got my hands on a flash drive that I downloaded games like Goat Simulator and Gmod and the like during lunch breaks. The problem was: I was a student, and the student accounts on the computers were not able to run programs directly off of removable media. So, in order to play my games, I'd have to copy the files over to the computer and run them from there. The other problem was: the school computers had Deep Freeze installed on them, so I'd have to copy them back if I wanted to save my progress.That copying/pasting took way too long.So I thought,But Deep Freeze will revert any changes made to specified drives on the computer whenever they're rebooted, which happened automatically every night. So I could either disable the automatic rebooting and risk some dumb kid turning my computer off accidentally, or I could disable Deep Freeze.*cracks knuckles*I tried deleting the program files for it, but it wouldn't let me. I did some research, and this is where I learned Lesson 3. So I made myself the owner of the Deep Freeze folders, then deleted them.Nice.Except, when I went back to school the next day, it was back.This is where I learned Lesson 2. It was a bit more difficult on the school computers, but I was able to get the computer I was on into recovery mode. Since the “user” that accesses system files in recovery mode is technically the computer itself, it had permission to make any changes it wants. I tried deleting Deep Freeze from here, hoping it wouldn't be reinstalled the next day. Sadly, it was.…Now I did not come to this next conclusion on my own (I think I followed some long-lost YouTube tutorial). But I did figure out how to implement it in this specific situation.When the computer is in recovery mode, since it's mostly there in case of emergency, most Windows features are stripped away (like the basic file explorer), and you're basically left with nothing but a command line. But a command line is a very powerful tool, if you know the commands.Since I didn't have a file explorer, and trying to open one just opened another command line, I opened notepad. Then, I pressed “File”, then hit “Open”.Boom. File explorer. But what good is a file explorer, you ask?To which I reply:With the computer under the assumption that I was trying to open a text file, I navigated to the System32 folder and located sethc.exe, and renamed it to something else (I think it was sethcq.exe or something). Then I found the command line exe (cmd.exe).Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V.I now had cmd.exe and cmd (2).exe. I renamed cmd (2).exe to sethc.exe.Now we're cooking with grease.I rebooted the computer, and since Deep Freeze didn't see anything wrong, nothing was reverted. On the login screen for the computer, before I was even logged in, I press Shift 5 times, and a command line comes up.Success!Using that command line, I made myself a full admin and gave myself full rights to everything. Then I deleted Deep Freeze.Next day, it's back on.I came to find out that there was a program running on a network drive that would reinstall Deep Freeze if it was uninstalled. I didn't even have permission to give myself permission to edit those files, so it seemed like I was stuck. I was an admin on this computer, but I didn't have the login for the network drive.Then it hit me: the computer has to be connected to the network drive in order for the network drive to make any changes. I couldn't disconnect the drive from the computer, butI still didn't have the login for the drive, so what I did is (and keep in mind, I've been doing all this in chunks of 45 minute lunch breaks) I downloaded a full, clean .iso of Windows, burned it to my flash drive (which meant I had to delete all my games, rip. But it's for the greater good), and booted the computer from the flash drive instead of the hard drive. I reinstalled Windows on the hard drive, and voila!The teacher came out, and I was instantly banned from the computer lab.Lesson 4: don't get caught :PEdit:So a lot of the comments suggest I should've just installed my own OS on the flash drive, and they're right. I just didn't think of doing that. The problem I was trying to solve at that point had changed from “how do I play games on the school computer” to “how do I delete Deep Freeze.”",588 followers,William A Bagnall,21.1K,202,1.3M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Can-you-name-some-latest-upcoming-technology-that-most-of-us-dont-know-about-but-should-know

In this way, we can prevent the water bodies from pollution, at least to a certain extent.This small hack may bring a huge change.Happy Reading!!!Image Source: Google.","135,530 followers",Hector Quintanilla,10.3K,1.2K,88.6M,2012,https://www.quora.com/Can-you-name-some-latest-upcoming-technology-that-most-of-us-dont-know-about-but-should-know

28,Because “robots” in surgery are not really robots. They are not in any way autonomous. They are devices to assist the surgeon in operating more precisely or in areas where hands cannot reach. We are nowhere near a point where a robot can do even the simplest surgery on its own. The near endless minor variations in anatomy would stop any robot dead in its tracks or cause a disastrous complication. It’s much simpler to have a robot fly a plane autonomously yet that hasn’t happened either. Autonomous cars? Same issues. Too many variables. Those other cases will be solved long before we have robotBecause “robots” in surgery are not really robots. They are not in any way autonomous.

29,"No. The robot is only as good as the technician working it and the patient its operating on.I am of the old school of nursing, and yes minimally invasive surgery plus new materials and equipment like instruments gave the surgeon a wider range of choices in operating.Back in the 60s the suture material was catgut, nylon and silk, two of them causing tissue reactions. So many wound break downs. Jump to the turn of the century and clips and better suture material, meant faster and improved success rates, just in abdominal surgery alone. [Plus anaesthetics]IF a tumour is in a hard to get to placeNo. The robot is only as good as the technician working it and the patient its operating on.I am of the old school of nursing, and yes minimally invasive surgery plus new materials and equipment like instruments gave the surgeon a wider range of choices in operating.Back in the 60s the suture material was catgut, nylon and silk, two of them causing tissue reactions.

[Plus anaesthetics]IF a tumour is in a hard to get to place and is wrapped or grown into a vital organ like the spinal cord, then no robot will make a miracle of the operation. What it can do is more precise action and movements reducing the chances of damage.
