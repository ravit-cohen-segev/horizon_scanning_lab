Germany is not the most technologically advanced country. It could be pretty close, but there are major elements of society who dedicate themselves to making sure that Germany uses inferior technology that kills more people, damages the environment more, costs more money, and will cause the total collapse of Earth’s biosphere due to a runaway greenhouse effect. Mostly in the Green Party. Because radiation from nuclear accidents is apparently scarier than way more people dying of regular pollution constantly and the total annihilation of all life on Earth as the oceans boil away.","5,990 followers",Jens Böttiger,566,2.6K,17.6M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Is-the-opposite-of-technologically-advanced-technologically-behind

I see a pattern that has been around for centuries: the speed of development of technology-dependent objects can be enhanced if “someone” commissions additional R&D. Mega-rich people can be that “someone” on multiple concurrent projects in multiple areas. Think of the military objects in major museums: typically they embody the advanced technologies of the day. Examples include innovative weapons (eg the first military explosives, the first guns) and innovative protective outer-wear (eg the first bullet proof vest or, centuries earlier, the first chainmail). Jump to the present, and the technologies may be different (eg e-Neuroscience, AI, nanotech, rather than past-era metallurgy and inorganic chemistry) but the pattern is the same as in past ages: being rich (in terms of money or influence or contacts or smarts) makes it easier to hire experts who can provide early insights into which scientists or technologists to support, and to get early warning of breakthrough advanced technologies, then to commission fast-track applications of those breakthroughs, without having to wait the decades that the rest of us endure before we can buy affordable versions of yesterday’s breakthroughs. DARPA, NSF and NIH are publicly-funded organisations that play a significant part in creating initial versions of today’s publicised “advanced technologies and methodologies”, which form the basis for future-facing products whose developmental road maps are apparent to any professional involved in Horizon Scanning or similar ways of tracking or creating the Next Big Thing.

But as you can see, this set-up is a very different beast to our pocket smartphones with Skype or Facetime, because Côté simply couldn’t have imagined the technological changes that would take place in the intervening century.If you’d told people back then that we’d invent the internet, miniaturise electrical devices to pocket sized, and mobilise our telephone network, only for it to be dominated by porn, cats, food pictures and duckfaces, they’d have thought you were mad.Back to our space station predictions, well, we’ve probably got as much chance of accurately foretelling what they’ll look like as Côté did of predicting video calls. We know it will exist, and based on what we currently have available we can make a stab at what it might look like, but beyond that we’re likely to be wildly off the mark except by sheer luck.If you look atFor my money, there are a couple that get close to what we might see, and that’s only because they approached the issue from an engineering perspective rather than visual effects.2001: A Space OdysseyThe design of the space station and theThese structures don’t stand a chance on Earth, but they don’t need to.

He has a number of quaint and useful sayings pertaining to his work. A personal favorite, and the one that’sLet’s make some comparisons to various types of real life spacecraft, and identify their purposes, and how they were designed for the job.The Apollo Lunar Module was built with a few key purposes in mind. It was built to operate in a vacuum (so aerodynamics could be ignored) and to land on another world with a small crew of explorers. It didn’t have to last terribly long, but it still required precautions, such as gold foil, to help it last as long as it did. It needed to be able to communicate with people really really far away. It needed to be able to slow down, change direction, stop, and start with incredible precision.Compare this to the space shuttle orbiter.Clearly, the shuttle is designed for a completely different task. It’s built to operate in the atmosphereLong story short, every element you might see in a spacecraft wFictional spacecraft are a little bit different. While real life spacecraft are cool as a consequence of their original design, fictional spacecraft are inevitably designed to be visually appealing first, and not always especially practical.Oftentimes, they’re loaded with features meant to awe us. Not very many real contractors would actually want to employ the use of a(I mean, doesn’t it?)In the end, I’d propose an alternative hypothesis.I think that science fiction spacecraft look the way they do, partially from influences of real life spacecraft, and partially from the influences of our real world experiences. After all, the craft from Star Wars are pretty clearly inspired by real world vehicles: trashy cargo trucks, or military jets and war birds.As time goes on, our spacecraft will advance technologically, and their purposes will expand. With that, their appearances will change to match, as necessity demands.With this, science fiction spacecraft will continue to draw influences from existing technology, and fit to match their appearances.(1950s sci-fi picture. Note the close resemblance to the V2 rocket and the spacesuits worn during the Gemini missions.)My prediction?Spacecraft in the future won’t look the least bit like they’re predicted to appear in our works of science fiction. Rather, their appearance will reflect their functionality.

The lasers then decelerate the ship back into the solar system.The ship has a kind of shield that has multiple layers to protect it from interstellar debris.The ship takes 6 odd years to travel to the star system in the movie.The ship has radiators. Large “wings” that use EM radiation to eject heat from the spaceship. Antimatter drives would generate loads of heat.It also has a setup that keeps the whole ship in tension, so as to minimize mass.Which all make the ISV Venturestar pretty dang cool, to me at least. I mean, how many spaceships in sci fi have radiators?The red things are the radiators, followed by the engines. Between the two are propellant tanks, and followed by that is the truss structure. Getting towed along is the payload, followed by the crew module and the ship’s shield. It flips around after accelerating to put the shield first, and to put it into position to decelerate. The engines are slightly angled to protect the crew.",0 followers,Jim Hogarth,10.5K,94,5.5M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Is-the-opposite-of-technologically-advanced-technologically-behind

This is the entire premise of a “nuclear deterrent”.Star Wars is a galaxy with tech so powerful, they can propel city-sized objects to the speed of light (and into another dimension) in mere seconds. Going by relativistic physics, as matter approaches the speed of light, its kinetic energy approachesYet they spend hours in battles, chipping away at enemy ships with laser beams, and sending fleets full of people across parsecs of space to engage in said conflicts.The Holdo Maneuver inIf war in Star Wars followed realistic military trends, space battles would just be a series of projectiles (explosive or otherwise) sent through hyperspace at military targets, with the power to obliterate entire blockades, bases, planets, or even star systems.

This will make stealth pretty much impossible(you’re glowing hot in the infrared, people will see you from across the solar system)The crew module will account for a tiny amount of the mass. More often, more than 50% of the mass will be fuel & propellant. The next most will be the giant armour plates over the ship. Then radiators. Then weapons and ammo. Crew might come in dead last in the mass breakdown.Armour plates will usually be Whipple shields, first layer breaks down the projectile, the second layer actually protects against the splintered shards.Weaponry could be all sorts of things, like railguns launching tiny micro-flak bombs, or single use tubes crammed with propellant and launching a 145t yield mini-nuke at 9 km/s, or just a railgun firing solid projectiles at ludicrous speed. Lasers, due to beam diffraction and beam quality factor, will have damage drop-off at range. They are also power-hogs, so aren’t amazing for ship-to-ship, but they excel at targeting fragile parts on another ship, or destroying incoming drones and missiles.Sidenote:It isn’t quite as realistic as OP would like: see fusion reactor and fusion rocket engines, but it still follows the design conventions that a realistic military spacecraft would have to follow, and fusion engines aren’t",495 followers,Megan McCarthy,3.5K,85,682.3K,2020,https://www.quora.com/Do-rich-people-have-advanced-technology-the-public-does-not
