9,"I passed out of VESIT this year and I am lucky to witness the transition from what VESIT was before CBSGS and what it is after that. Mine was the first batch under the CBSGS schedule.Here are my two cents about student life at VESIT -1. Your ID card is more important than your life at VESIT. Principal, Professor, Senior, Labrarian, non teaching staff, Watchman, ground staff .. everyone are equally authorised to confiscate / ask for your ID anytime, anywhere. It's the ultimate key to roam freely about.2. Hostelite Vs Localite divide (although it's blurring year by year) is huge. A few years bacI passed out of VESIT this year and I am lucky to witness the transition from what VESIT was before CBSGS and what it is after that. Mine was the first batch under the CBSGS schedule.Here are my two cents about student life at VESIT -1. Your ID card is more important than your life at VESIT. Principal, Professor, Senior, Labrarian, non teaching staff, Watchman, ground staff .. everyone are equally authorised to confiscate / ask for your ID anytime, anywhere. It's the ultimate key to roam freely about.2. Hostelite Vs Localite divide (although it's blurring year by year) is huge. A few years back it was more profound than Sunni or Shia tribes. But hostelite VESITians would always be helpful. Be it studies or hiding you for a night, they can come in handy.3. VESIT is very lively. The hustle is always in the air. Some or the other activity, be it sports or culture or technical, something is always happening at VESIT. But everything comes at the cost of attendance.Since you asked 'what it's like to STUDY at VESIT' I would not touch the other (more interesting) things at VESIT.4. At VESIT, the amount of hatred you have against your department depends on what floor you are studying. (CS and IT guys usually say that their lives are easy because it is the ETRX guys who get caught bunking, thanks to the open amphitheater at their floor.)5. The Library has transformed a lot. With AC and comfortable seats, the corner places are always occupied with someone dozing off. But the massive collection of books and the humble staff make it all perfect for a nerd. Yes. VESIT is nerdy.6. Studies haunt you three days before each paper of end sem exam and three hours before each paper of the unit tests. Don't let this turn into panic. Start early in the semester and be in touch with syllabus. Easier said that done. And expect the unexpected for it's MU.7. Talking of syllabus, number of hours allotted per chapter has got nothing to do with the weightage of marks for that chapter in the final paper. Its a myth.8. Tech max publications shall be your best friend in need. You start like a patriotic soldier with 4 reference books like canons up in arms ready to shoot the villainous examinations, only to find that you have slowly started using a small tech max handgun that works only at point blank. Choice is yours.9. A minimum of 16 out of 20 at internals, and a minimum of 55 out of 80 in end sem for every subject is enough to land you 8 pointer. Which is decent. But tough if you get into other useless activities at VESIT.10. Teachers are very helpful. A few are quite talented and its our job as students to dig deep into what our teachers are working on. This can help land some projects with them and that's the ultimate thing you ought to do at the department.All in all, understand that 8 pointer, good projects, balanced extra curricular activities and good rapport with everyone is something that is necessary at VESIT for a fresher to thrive.These are obviously my personal views and things have changed a lot in these 4 years.Edit -Some excerpts from my experiences at VESIT apart from academics-1. The first thing you'd notice at VESIT is the crowd. You would come across students from different backgrounds with a plethora of interests and talents. Every year brings in fresh ammunition to different frontiers at the college, be it academic or non academic. Competition is felt everywhere.2. The three student councils - Sports, Cultural, and Music shall make sure you are always away from studies and bring in the much needed 'spice' in the otherwise monotonous life. ( # council_elections )3. There is a fourth 'council', the Social Responsibility Team (SoRT). Although it has lost its sheen , this is the most dedicated student group that has touched lives all over Mumbai for the past 7-8 years. Highly underestimated and always in the background, the humble SoRT has always made VESIT proud.4. VESIT enjoys a certain aura of its own. Be it the vibrant waste of the RCF flowing by the campus, be it the mesmerizing ammonia odour, or be it the close proximity to the red light area, it's all magic. After all the college lies right in the heart of a gas chembur.5. The four leading student organizations, A.K.A. the (not so) 'Technical Societies' have managed to tap the most skilled and the most strenuous ones only to put them to work round the clock. Being a part of these orgs truly adds feathers to your co curricular endeavors.6. In the recent 'Seat Badhao, Jagah Banao' yojana at VESIT, the canteen has been halved, and common rooms cleared to make room for classrooms. Do not be surprised if you don't get a fixed classroom each week. Welcome to the nomadic tribes.7. Lifts, gardens, corners in the corridors, places underneath the stairs, library corners and terrace are NOT safe (private) anymore. (For any purposes). But there are a few iconoclasts who dare it and make it to the breaking news!There's actually a lot to pen down here.Every floor has its own story. Each room has its own secrets (apart from the usual WiFi hacks). The more you put in here, the more you get out of it.""At VESIT, Help Shall Always Be There For Those Who Seek !

I really don't know what is reputation of V.I.T in companies having presence in North India.Now coming to International Reputation, V.I.T is not that well known. I have met people form different countries, they know there are IITs and that's all what they know sometimes.What I personally feel is that V.I.T is fairly young university as compared to other reputed universities in India and if everything goes well it might take another decade to build a good International reputation. Reputation is also a chain reaction. Whenever we (V.I.T Students) do an Intern-ship, Project etc. at a company, he/she is not only building his/her reputation but is also building reputation of University. If the student performs well then that company might be more open to V.I.T Students and if the performance is bad then forget about more opportunities at that company.
