This is very bad because there is no consensus or decentralization and it goes to shows the entire Bitcoin core is monopolized by a single group of developers.If you noticed lately, Everytime there is a tether pump, Bitcoin pumps with it. Bitcoin‚Äôs current valuation is based on how much tethers are used to buy btc. Otherwise, there are no real life usage of btc with transaction fees averaging at 15USD. Nobody is going to buy pizza and pay 15 dollars for transaction fees, so it's just a game of hot potato until it crumbles.Litecoin is much faster, but bitcoin still has the branding and first mover advantage. As of now, the closest currency to claim the brand of Bitcoin is Bitcoin Cash. With transaction fees at sub 1 cents and confirmation in minutes, it's the second crypto currency that's above 1k USD although they only forked 4 months ago.Due to wide adoption on everyday use, Bitpay and Coinbase will be supporting Bitcoin Cash very soon, you can Google it up. For a cryptocurrency to have such massive scale and growth, you should consider reading it up and understand both sides of Bitcoin core and Bitcoin cash. If you've not done your homework yet, please do not risk buying into either one, it's very risky and you should only buy if you are confident and sure if your choices.",0 followers,Glen Boston,588,71,1.7M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Could-Litecoin-replace-Bitcoin-as-top-dog-Even-though-theres-more-of-them-theyre-quicker-and-with-better-technology-Could-Bitcoin-stall-at-say-100k-and-Litecoin-go-on-to-grow-passed-that

Be careful out there for there are so many fake investment website claiming to be paying.In late August or early September, Litecoin will experience a halving.A halving is when miners receive half as much compensation for mining a single block in the blockchain.Currently, miners get 25 LTC per block and will get 12.5 LTC in three months.Such a halving has occurred in the past as well in 2015 when miners were getting 50 LTC per block. But then, the halving didn‚Äôt affect the price too much, as a lot of coins were emitted during it.This year, however, it‚Äôs going to be much different. People are saying that 100% increase is likely, but that 100% won‚Äôt the for today‚Äôs price, it will be for the price before the halving, which could be around $150.What I think is that LTC will grow not by 100%, but by 70%. This is because the halving is always accompanied by coin emission, and this year it won‚Äôt be different.Around 23 million coins will be emitted during the halving, which will put it at a grand total of 85 million in circulation. Based on the fact that those 23 million are 30% of the current total, I believe that the price will be affected by around 70%, maybe 50%.The supply and demand will be corrected either way, so an increase is guaranteed.",27 followers,Fernando Reyes,706,0,0,2020,https://www.quora.com/Could-Litecoin-replace-Bitcoin-as-top-dog-Even-though-theres-more-of-them-theyre-quicker-and-with-better-technology-Could-Bitcoin-stall-at-say-100k-and-Litecoin-go-on-to-grow-passed-that

Supports variety of cryptocurrency like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin. I find that it has a really nice UI and support.This has simply to do with the fact, that Bitcoin is the first Cryptocurrency, is the biggest Cryptocurrency, and also that it is the best-known Cryptocurrency by the general public.It is important for any store of value to be largely recognized, so I really think Bitcoin is a better store of value than Litecoin.On the other hand, Litecoin clearly wins in regard to how usable it is as a day-to-day currency.Litecoin just has faster transactions times, and also the transaction fees of Litecoin are way smaller than the ones of Bitcoin.This makes Litecoin more ideal for doing small day-to-day transactions and using it as regular money since its transactions are faster and cheaper than Bitcoin‚Äôs transactions.I would also say that in regards to mining, Litecoin is better than Bitcoin.The goal of most (excluding Ripple üòâ) Cryptocurrencies is, that the transactions on the network are controlled and verified by a decentralized network so that no fraud can occur, and malicious actors do not have the chance to lead the network in a bad way.Litecoin‚Äôs hashing algorithm Scrypt enables smaller miners to participate more easily in Litecoin‚Äôs network since Litecoin isn‚Äôt as easily mined by the professional ASIC miners as Bitcoin.On the other hand, Bitcoin uses the SHA-256 hashing algorithm, which leads to the centralization of Bitcoin miners in large warehouses, packed with professional ASIC miners.Litecoin is being mined in a more distributed way, which is good for the decentralization, and security of the whole network.Both, Bitcoin and Litecoin are planning to implement the Lightning network, which will enable users to complete lightning-fast and super-cheap transactions, by doing off-chain transactions. And only when the off-chain payment channel is closed, the final balance is noted down in the Bitcoin blockchain.The Lightning network will also enable atomic swaps, which is essentially a way to exchange between different Cryptocurrencies, without having to use a centralized exchange, but simply by using the Cryptocurrencies themselves.","99,900 followers",Alcatraz Dey,9K,1.4K,68.2M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Could-Litecoin-replace-Bitcoin-as-top-dog-Even-though-theres-more-of-them-theyre-quicker-and-with-better-technology-Could-Bitcoin-stall-at-say-100k-and-Litecoin-go-on-to-grow-passed-that

The trend is just beginning in my humble opinion.So while some in here, and on facebook are saying LITECOIN is dead, if they actually bothered to get off their butt and do the correct research they will realize that blockchain has not even started yet, and if that is correct, LITECOIN would be in the same situation!, its barely even started, no matter what you are hearing on social media and online. As an expert I can tell you have invested in litecoin since it was $9 and I do not plan on getting rid of them.Do your due dilligence, and realize this is the next INTERNET coming, its not just some fad, or some weekend trend. This is going to revolutionize everything we do online, offline, and everything in between.Charlie Lee has a major announcement coming the end of this year, I already know what this will be about, and its going to be earth shattering, that is all I will say, and it will prove my point that LITECOIN is going to play a major part in crypto-land as we move forward on this historical technological revolutionary journey.We have never had something disrupt individual currencies before, and that is why people are so skeptical. I would be the last one to be skeptical about all this. This is going to change lives, but you are entitled to your own opinion.This space is not only going to create millionaires, and billionaires, its going to make day to day life completely different from what it is now. The only thing is that its going to take longer than people think! When you have such big changes, like when we never had the internet, it takes years to design, and implement. Actual idea to things that work in the real world take time, dedication and lots of hard work. But I can say things are on track right now as we go into the next 24 months for all things crypto.So No!, Litecoin is not dead, or dying, or going to burn out like most are saying. Litecoin is solving many problems, that have been begging to be solved for years, and that [litecoins game] has not even started, the opening credits have just been rolled up.

17,"Some companies have higher standards than Google or Facebook, and some are just looking for something different. Apple, for example, is even harder to get in to, both because of fewer places and because of even stricter culture for requirements.Just because an individual can't get hired at those places does not mean they're a poor developer; just as likely they don't fit with the company culture. Which is OK, they may well fit somewhere else. And vice versa too, many Googlers would be a poor fit in other environments.","129,177 followers",Jessica Su,573,1.5K,49.7M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Why-do-top-tech-companies-like-Google-Facebook-and-Quora-test-their-candidates-mainly-on-their-DSA-but-not-software-development-and-technological-skills

Getting to the level of ‚ÄúStaff Engineer‚Äù at Google is notoriously difficult (arguably, the title means less and is easier to achieve at many other tech companies due to a phenomena called ‚Äútitle inflation‚Äù). Most engineers at Google will never reach the Staff-level.2).
