1,"Prediction, as a concept, is based on just one main factor, pattern. Our limitations lie in defining and identifying accurate patterns, in all aspects of the universe. For instance, technology has evolved as a result of patterns in Human behavior. We dream, ponder, we want and therefore, we create. So the question detailing - “why” we haven’t evolved the way we ought to, is a conundrum because, we are humans; and, we can not determine why, when and where we want what, in our lives. Our evolution is strictly guided by our wants and desires, - towards the pursuit of happiness.So, if we declare aPrediction, as a concept, is based on just one main factor, pattern.

The clothes, the planes, the cars, the houses are all pretty similar. The technology that no one really saw was the internet, WWW, and the ubiquitous smart phone. The concept that the web would transform our lives didn’t even occur to most of us in the 90s, when we started using it. I can remember a couple of friends having mobile phones in the mid 90s and wondering why they felt a phone at home wasn’t enough.So the technology to communicate and control your home from your phone or watch is pretty cool, but it’s far less than we were expecting.","5,085 followers",Bobby Tatro,3.9K,2.2K,45.6M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Why-has-technology-not-evolved-the-way-people-thought-it-would-in-the-50s-and-60s

7,"One of the main advances that I see on almost all of the highway and road construction projects that I work on is the use of computer modeling with the heavy equipment.

These would always get knocked down because they were in the way of the work. With today’s technology, the Contractor will have a handheld survey unit that has the important features already set up in the machine. For example, they can know exactly where an irrigation box will go just by letting the machine tell them.When we have a new design, or change, that can be entered into the computer and the Contractor can get right on that change, rather than having to lay it out in the field first.The picture below is a model commonly used by the surveyor.

8,"Infrastructure is everything.It took early humans many thousands of years just toInfrastructure is everything.It took early humans many thousands of years just toWhile there were very many practical reasons for why our early ancestors hadn't advanced as quickly as we would've hoped, here are just a few:• No formalized language• No conception of mathematics or value of its use• No formal logic skills• No education on which to build information to advance the next generation• No advanced commerce techniques• No cities to flee to for protection or greater safety• No understanding about how diseases can be communicated or possibly guarded against• No awareness of how simple biology worked• No awareness of basic, good-practice hygiene or sanitation• No knowledge of how or why the seasons change• No agricultural skills (not until around 10,000 B.C.E)• No knowledge of how to refine environmental items into more useful tools• No laws or any sense of justice governing society• No formalized history to connect one generation to the nextThey had little to no awareness of what was over, let's say, a mountain range in the distance. If they could climb over the mountain range, they didn't know if there would be other humans on the other side, if they were friendly, or if they could even communicate with them. There was no standard language, no understanding of reading, and outside of ones fingers and toes used for comparison, there was not even the slightest conception of mathematics. They had to learn how to make fire, and learnThe list could go on and on, but all of humanity’s advancements can best be understood asWhat our ancestors 200 years ago did, was finally awaken to the value of the accumulated knowledge those who lived 199,800 years earlier had acquired; of course, at the time they didn't know about evolution, genetics or even how old humanity was. Unlike our early ancestors, those living 200 years ago were now living in bustling towns and cities with warm homes and universities, and able to aim all of their refined and sophisticated curiosity at things that we didn't yet know or understand.Looking forward, with the advent of the internet and the eventual computational abilities of Artificial Intelligence, we are going to see an even higher spike in human advancement, probably within the next 50–100 years, there will be more changes than we can even attempt to model.My argument is that it takes a long time to start anything from scratch, but given enough time, the growth is explosive and exponential.I hope this was helpful,-Rodney Upton-",UNKNOWN,Erwin,11K,7.4K,52.6M,2017,https://www.quora.com/How-much-has-TCP-IP-technology-evolved-in-the-last-15-years
9,"The Singularity Is NearTo appreciate the nature and significance of the coming “singularity,” it is important to ponder the nature of exponential growth. Toward this end, I am fond of telling the tale of the inventor of chess and his patron, the emperor of China.THE LEGEND OF THE NEVER ENDING CHESSBOARD RICEIn response to the emperor’s offer of a reward for his new beloved game, the inventor asked for a single grain of rice on the first square, two on the second square, four on the third, and so on. The Emperor quickly granted this seemingly benign and humble request.

The Emperor quickly granted this seemingly benign and humble request. One version of the story has the emperor going bankrupt as the 63 doubling’s ultimately totaled 18 million trillion grains of rice. At ten grains of rice per square inch, this requires rice fields covering twice the surface area of the Earth, oceans included.It should be pointed out that as the emperor and the inventor went through the first half of the chess board, things were fairly uneventful. The inventor was given spoonfuls of rice, then bowls of rice, then barrels. By the end of the first half of the chess board, the inventor had accumulated one large field’s worth (4 billion grains), and the emperor did start to take notice. It was as they progressed through the second half of the chessboard that the situation quickly deteriorated. Incidentally, with regard to the doubling’s of computation, that’s about where we stand now–there have been slightly more than 32 doubling’s of performance since the first programmable computers were invented during World War II.The point to ponder over this story is thatNotice how your Nokia 3310 remained ever so hip and up to date for years on end, but today your brand new iPhone 6s is obsolete within 6 months?Here’s an exampleSO IS THERE A LIMIT ?Apparently yes. At least that’s what Moore’s lawGordonIf this holds true than we might just reach a future where every new piece of technology becomes obsolete, the second its launched.How ever that seems to be impossible as of now. Why? Because we have literally started making transistors the size of atoms. We have reached the limit of modern computing and the only way to move on is throughFINAL VERDICT.Long answer short.

Fire, agriculture, building cities, etc., these are all things that we teach our children and continue building on for generations. Cultural transmission is responsible for so much in human history. Of course our ability to use language is a major reason why this is possible. Some animals also have cultural transmission in limited ways (mother animals showing infant animals what to eat, etc.) but not to the scale that humans use it.But more recently, writing has allowed us to specialize in and share our knowledge. Not everything needs to be passed down from one person to another over generations, but now it can also be transmitted horizontally within the same generation. A biologist, a physicist and a chemist can write a research paper together based on their shared (but not overlapping) knowledge, and then the whole world can quickly learn about the results and benefit from them. You may have heard of the “Last Man Who Knew Everything” (for example:So the first type of knowledge is innate, in our brains, our genes. The second type is shared and accumulated over time, transmitted vertically through humans over generations. The third type is dispersed across societies, and shared especially through writing.Interestingly, today we are on the edge of another revolution of intelligence: augmentation by machines.
