When launching a career in blockchain development, it can be difficult to determine which skills are the most important to pursue. Job postings can give candidates some indications of what organizations want, but these ""requirements"" tend to be tailored toward a company's specific needs.Because Blockchain is such an emerging concept, no single person could pretend to be a master in every Blockchain developing skill. So, for this reason, we will talk about skills that are essential for any Blockchain Developer.Blockchain architectureBlockchain developers should fully understand how blockchain works and the architecture on which it's based. They should be well versed in concepts such as cryptography, consensus, hash functions, distributed ledgers, smart contracts and any other concepts integral to understanding blockchain's inner workings.CryptographyEffective cryptography is essential to providing a secure blockchain environment, and developers should have a strong foundation in cryptographic concepts and practices, including wallets, keys and digital signatures. They should know how to use public-key cryptography to prevent unauthorized access to data and understandthe differences between cryptographic hash functions like SHA-256 and Keccak-256.Data structures. The entire blockchain network consists of data structures. Each block can be considered a type of data structure that clusters transactions for the public ledger.Smart contracts.Blockchain developers should also be familiar with the programming languages commonly used for smart contracts, such as Vyper, Solidity or Chaincode.Programming languages:Blockchain technologies often use different programming languages, depending on the platforms used to implement the blockchain environments. Although developers can't be experts in every language, they still need to be proficient in any number of them. Some of the more common languages used for blockchain include Java, C++, Python and JavaScript.Developers should also have a strong foundation in object-oriented programming and be familiar with an assortment of development libraries and frameworks.So above are basic thing you a commerce student must know to start a career in blockchain technologyTo master in blockchain and want to learn from zero level i suggest to do Blockchain Certification Which will definitely help you to grow your career in BlockchainIf you're looking for a better career I personally suggest to go for blockchain professional certificationIf you are wondering where to begin this journey? Then you should check the blockchain certificationBut you first check if the institute has goodwill in the market and if this blockchain expert certification online is accepted globally or not. Check the review before applying.From my experience I personally recommend to do certificates in blockchain certification from the GSDC website online.As I have one reference for a blockchain for business certification I found one course on google they provide certificatesThe certification cost is also affordable here.The blockchain for business certification costs $200. This certification is from GSDC. You can check the syllabus on their official websites.Cost : $200Location: OnlineThe GSDC certification bodies provide blockchain for business certification online and it is valid and accepted globally.Many of the reputed company employees have done this courses from here and give good responses and rated the blockchain certificationTo get this certification you have to pass the Blockchain Certification online course exam from GSDC Institution.GSDC's certification is aimed towards sharing a deep understanding of all the advanced blockchain for business certification coursesThe purpose of Blockchain Professional Certification qualification is to confirm that a candidate has sufficient knowledge and understanding of the benefits of this certification.","31,157 followers",Phillip Remaker,1.7K,11K,78.8M,2021,https://www.quora.com/How-can-a-commerce-student-contribute-and-make-a-career-in-the-most-exciting-emerging-blockchain-technology

The 300kya date is for Levalois cores in Europe and Africa. That tweaks the timelines a bit, but it’s not something with profound implications for evolution.","2,691 followers",Peter Losh,744,8.9K,16.8M,2019,https://www.quora.com/How-can-a-commerce-student-contribute-and-make-a-career-in-the-most-exciting-emerging-blockchain-technology
2,"Why would it?The theory of evolution is about biodiversity, not about the emergence and development of technology.It would not be the first time we realize that knowledge may grow, stagnate, disappear only to be re-established later on; the whole time period called The Renaissance was about the return of Antiquity’s knowledge to the western world after centuries of “dark ages” when this knowledge had been lost.

Such fluctuations has no incidence whatsoever on the theory of evolution.Tools appearing earlier or later than previously found could modify our understanding of technological achievement for hominids; but nothing of consequence at all with the biological evolution of said hominids. They are still found where the theory expect them to be, albeit with a different level of technological sophistication.And even if the later had been the case; that is what science is all about: correcting our knowledge and understanding to better conform to reality as new evidence are found.Moreover, new evidence do not erase previous evidence.All evidence must be considered when trying to understand reality. Because science look at evidence with rigorous tools like peer review to remove human bias, what has been established can be revised even profoundly in light of the new evidence; but it can not be completely wrong once it has been recognized as factually explaining reality, making correct novel predictions and leading to actual applications. At worse, it is replaced in it’s better, proper context… and overall understanding grows further.Case in point; Einstein theory of relativity deeply changed our understanding of physics and the universe way beyond Newtonian physics ever could; but what Newton found still is valid in a local setting like our planet and is in fact the very basis on which relativity itself sprouted. It was inadequate to explain fully the mechanics of the macroverse and the microverse, but what Newton understood like all the laws of inertia and motion he defined still holds when we build a bridge or drive a car.it is important to make the difference between a hypothesis (i.e. abiogenesis) which is a working idea based on facts, and a theory (i.e. evolution by natural selection) which is a validated explanation of the facts. Too many people confuse the two; not to say confusing a scientific hypothesis with a mere opinion or belief which are ideas that are not based on facts and/or can not be worked with (i.e. God did it).A hypothesis can be completely wrong from the get go and invalidated by evidence. A theory has proved itself to be right with enough evidence to back the hypothesis it validated, even if still and always open to revision and even refutation; but the longer it stands scrutiny and new evidence it predicts keeps piling up, the less likely it becomes that it will be proven “completely” wrong.",75 followers,Reo Maynard,1K,1.8K,653.3K,2019,https://www.quora.com/New-analysis-of-artifacts-found-at-a-South-China-archaeological-site-shows-that-sophisticated-tool-technology-emerged-in-East-Asia-as-long-ago-as-300-000-years-Are-our-current-timelines-of-human-evolution-completely

6,"Well, I don’t know that it’s necessarily in my nature to feel “safe.” Call me a child of the 80s, but I read once (where is long since lost to the winds of time) that a defining characteristic of GenX is that we watched our (mostly) fathers be relieved of their jobs and lose their pensions as they neared retirement after 30-odd years at the same company. Thus, the age of job hopping employees was born and along with it, an attitude of vulnerability in any role, which I embody acutely.UX would “appear” to be safe, if only because, as Bayu suggests, the core skills are not specific-technology deWell, I don’t know that it’s necessarily in my nature to feel “safe.” Call me a child of the 80s, but I read once (where is long since lost to the winds of time) that a defining characteristic of GenX is that we watched our (mostly) fathers be relieved of their jobs and lose their pensions as they neared retirement after 30-odd years at the same company. Thus, the age of job hopping employees was born and along with it, an attitude of vulnerability in any role, which I embody acutely.UX would “appear” to be safe, if only because, as Bayu suggests, the core skills are not specific-technology dependent. If you take this perspective, then you should be able to just keep shifting as new innovations come and you just keep rolling.However, on closer view, even as you change technologies, the specific knowledge of human behavior required to adequately create experiences with that technology begins to vary. For example, designing for voice interfaces draws from knowledge of human communication behavior, as well as memory, cognition, the auditory system, and speech (voice, fluency, articulation). Chatbots require some of this too, but instead of speech and hearing, a strong background in language and literacy would be helpful. Designing for mobile interfaces requires knowledge of vision and visual perception, along with cognition and memory, as well as some fine motor skills. A visual designer doesn’t just “become” a voice designer any more than a painter becomes a novelist. It requires different skills, although some may overlap. Certainly, knowledge of a UX process and experience in executing it is critically important to both types of design.So what does the future hold? Who knows… UX is a fun, challenging, creative, fascinating, complex field, but I’d argue it’s far from being “safe.”","7,437 followers",Xianhang Zhang,1.6K,812,2.5M,2018,https://www.quora.com/How-can-a-commerce-student-contribute-and-make-a-career-in-the-most-exciting-emerging-blockchain-technology
