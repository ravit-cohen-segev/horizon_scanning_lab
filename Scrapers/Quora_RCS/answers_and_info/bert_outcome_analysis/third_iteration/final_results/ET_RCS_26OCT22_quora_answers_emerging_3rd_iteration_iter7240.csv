Languages come and go. Adaptability is more important.Java as higher audience than the other two you mentioned and has more jobs.People pay developer based on how well do you know something and just because what do you know.Example: Given a choice , I would hire most skilled PHP/.net developer for Java development over a newbie.According to YouWorth, these 3 languages are averaging at:JAVA - $101k/yearPHP - $101k/year.NET - $80k - $90k/ yearIt could be argued that Java and PHP are not only higher paid, but are in higher demand. Java is the standard for a lot of web based content, games, apps, and even the Android operating system. It is also designed to work across multiple platforms. If possible, having a knowledge of all 3 would definitely help you in the marketplace but I would prioritize them in the order above. However, at the end of the day, your ability to solve problems will be what allows you to command a higher salary. If you are lacking in your ability to solve problems, you will be of little value to the company your work for.YouWorth is a free mobile app for both iOS and Android. Not only am I a champion for the product, but I use it myself. The app allows anyone to import LinkedIn skills and track their job market value over time. I'm also notified if there is a change in the skills being watched. This could be a great tool for you to use to compare the value of these skills over time.Well, most of the java developers write sophisticated mission critical application where serious expertise is crucial and budget is not always the issue.Having said that, if you have better skill set, you can always make higher than average programmer.",30 followers,Robin Thomas,8.6K,731,13.7M,2017,https://www.quora.com/Why-are-experienced-Java-developers-paid-so-much-higher-as-compared-to-experienced-Android-ruby-AngularJS-other-technologies-developers

3,"Invasions happen only to those regions that were worth conquering. People have always fought for the regions around the rivers of Jordan, Tigris, Nile and Rhine, because they found it worthy.

Throughout history they were so frequently invaded that there is very less link between their present culture and their glorious past. In the past 2000 years,In short, the history of civilizations is primarily about the history of invasions. No one was spared. Again, scientific superiority goes only so far. In a street fight between a mathematician and a thug who would win? To make it more complex, imagine another mathematician rival who sides the thug to fight the first mathematician. Technology cannot always overcome petty politics.In case of India, we talk about the handful of invasions because they were quite rare. India had resisted the invasion of Darius & others so that India never came under the Persian rule although so many ideas were exchanged. Then Alexander came and his armies had to turn back after an engrossing battled at the banks ofThe Kushans from central Asia had briefly penetrated that shield in 1st century, but were eventually Indianized and power restored to Indian rulers (Guptas). The central Asians (now Hunas) once again penetrated at the end of Guptas in 6th century, but after a brief rule they were both Indianized & replaced. The unstoppable Arabs were then stopped at theIn short, in Indus banks greatest world warriors like Darius, Alexander, Genghis Khan and the generals of Umayyad Caliphate were stopped.  And all of this is only for the northern India. Southern India for the most part avoided external invasions until the modern era. For over a century, the all-conquering Mongols tried invading and were not successful other than few border territories [The reduced number of invasions & extraordinary assimilation is one reason why India among the ancient civilizations has a cultural continuity. Ancient practices of the Vedic saints of pre-1500 BCE and those of Buddha & Mahavira of 600 BCE as much relevant today as it were probably centuries ago.Finally, about scientific advancements, some misconceptions need to be cleared. To understand that, let me give you an analogy from Cricket. We had an excellent opening partnership with Sachin like Harappa and Saurav like Mohenjodaro blasting the skies. Then they got out and there was a period of lull. Things were rebuilt under a Dravid like Vedic era and we kept slowly consolidating. Then after a period of slow moving, there was a vintage Yuvraj-Dhoni like Gupta & Chola civilization that rapidly got the civilization going.Then wickets kept falling and by the start of the powerplay like industrial revolution we were playing with a tailender and a substitute batsman lent by the opponent. When other teams blasted out in the powerplay, we were playing maiden over after maiden over. Part of that is good bowling from the opponent, but most of it is bad batting from our side. Even though we had a good start, we are now at a point our run rate is far below other times playing in parallel games.",26 followers,Balaji Viswanathan,4.5K,5.6K,427.2M,2015,https://www.quora.com/Why-are-experienced-Java-developers-paid-so-much-higher-as-compared-to-experienced-Android-ruby-AngularJS-other-technologies-developers

This definitely is advanced science. The mystical perception about India was an attraction for people across the globe. We are also geographically placed to enjoy the abundance of nature -sub tropical. So, many kingdoms came towards India to enjoy the prosperity.Also look at the leaders who inspired us - from Ashoka to Abdul Kalam. They ultimately take interest in things that are not really 'rational'. We are nonviolent to the core.  Even when we fought British, we used Satyagraha, supposed to be the highest form of Courage. Our outlook to strength is different. If you look at our attitude, none of this is really helpful in defending the borders as understood today.","38,615 followers",Krishna Suryakanth,6.6K,2K,76.1M,2015,https://www.quora.com/If-India-was-so-advanced-in-the-past-why-did-it-get-invaded-repeatedly-Why-were-we-defeated-if-we-had-scholars-in-the-political-sciences-and-masters-of-strategy
7,"First of all, 'India' as a continuous political entity did not exist until the British Empire. Apologies if you believe in 'Akhand Bharat', but the 'Akhand Bharat' map also shows the extent of the British Raj, not any continuously existing subcontinental civilisation.First of all, 'India' as a continuous political entity did not exist until the British Empire. Apologies if you believe in 'Akhand Bharat', but the 'Akhand Bharat' map also shows the extent of the British Raj, not any continuously existing subcontinental civilisation.Secondly, the subcontinent was greatly insulated from foreign invasions courtesy natural boundaries such as the Hindu Kush in the North-West, the Balochistan Desert in the border with Iran, the Himalayas in the North and North-East and of course, the Bay of Bengal and Arabian Sea. When nations are that insulated from invasions from outside the subcontinent, most of the wars would be played out between these nation states. But this relative insularity also came at the cost of the development of military technology and strategy, unlike most of the then-invaders.So when invasions did take place- the Greeks, the Parthians, Indo-Bactrians, Scythians, Huns, the Chinese, the Turks, the Persians, the Mughals and the British; the ruling Kingdoms and Empires were often found wanting.And no, the subcontinent never had technology that would have put the rest of the World to shame at the time. Civilisations emerged roughly around the same time in the Old World and technological development was comparable. Playing 'top trumps' with long-dead philosophers, scientists, rulers and religious leaders of long-dead kingdoms and empires, is an exercise in stupidity which has little bearing on actual history and only serves in propagating myths and fabrications.Finally, technological development is no guarantee against being invaded and routed by a less technologically developed military force. This has happened repeatedly across history, the most notable being Genghis Khan's hordes overrunning the far more advanced Song Dynasty in China and Khwarazmian Empire that controlled Persia and the Western part of Central Asia. That didn't happen in the Indian subcontinent, by all accounts, but it pays to remember that technological prowess while being excellent insurance, isn't a guarantee of invulnerability.","1,367 followers",Rahul Badami,16.4K,0,0,2016,https://www.quora.com/If-India-was-so-advanced-in-the-past-why-did-it-get-invaded-repeatedly-Why-were-we-defeated-if-we-had-scholars-in-the-political-sciences-and-masters-of-strategy

However if you've been using Google Translate for the past few years, you'll recognise that the service has been rapidly improving and approaching human-level.I've been learning French for ~30 minutes per day for the past 5 years, yet my vocabulary is nowhere near as broad as Google Translate and my grammar isn't nearly as consistently correct.If you haven't checked out Google Translate in a few years, I'd urge you to check it out again, and I imagine you'll be impressed at how it handily translates almost every paragraph I feed it correctly.So we have a service that can translate languages for us, yet people still expend time and effort learning languages, because it's not practical to use Google Translate in real life. Sure, we can and do used it to translate documents, but we can't pause a conversation to type in the previous sentence and understand it. Speech flows quickly, and until we have real-time translation, people will still have to learn languages to converse fluently.However real-time translation seems imminent, thanks to one brilliant innovation that is on sale and is being improved as we speak.This innovation is a pair of earphones, that two conversing users must wear. The earpiece recognises what was said by user 1, translates this to user 2's desired language and outputs this translation as sound in the new language, for user 2 to hear. Subsequently, user 2 replies in their native language and the process repeats, theoretically allowing me to converse in a language I've never spoken before.In practice, the technology is currently raw, and certain products enjoy superior quality to others.For example, Google recently released the Pixel Buds, which promised instantaneous translation and tight integration with Google Translate. In reality, the translations were slow, and often the earpiece misunderstood what the user was saying.Other devices offer an optimistic future for this area. For example, the Pilot earpiece from Waverly Labs offers a number of interesting features such as offline use, blocking out background noise for better accuracy and advanced software to understand different dialects.Dozens of other companies have competitive solutions too, and more will spring up to develop this innovation that promise enormous cultural changes and enhances free trade.Maybe the Babel Fish will be realistic in our lifetimes after all.","14,230 followers",Saran Udayakumar,2.3K,1K,29.3M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Why-are-experienced-Java-developers-paid-so-much-higher-as-compared-to-experienced-Android-ruby-AngularJS-other-technologies-developers
