The kentile floors got scrubbed and waxed every Saturday night.My mom and dad would buy bushels of apples and peaches and pears and can them. It was a tedious, grueling job, but we got to eat them all year till we were so sick of them that we could scream. By the time they were 10, my two older brothers combined delivered three hundred newspapers a day, in the cold, the heat, the rain and the snow. They also shined shoes, carried groceries home for old ladies for ten cent tips, and collected bottles to redeem. I was babysitting every week by the time I was 10.But we thought we were the rich kids, the lucky kids. We lived in our own house. Our shoes fit us. We knew lots of kids who really had it tough; kids whose dads had died in the war; kids with drunk moms or dads; kids with 11 siblings and no moms anymore; kids who couldn’t see three feet away but couldn’t afford eyeglasses; kids who lived in apartments with newspapers instead of glass for windows. There was no welfare for those kids; no section 8; no food stamps. Just clothes they got from kind neighbors whose kids had outgrown them. Just some free food from the church once in a while. And our world was very small. What happened two neighborhoods away might just as well have happened on Mars, so we could believe the world was a tough but good place to be.Are things harder now with microwaves and dishwashers, TVs in every room, and cars for everybody? Yes, a HELL OF A LOT harder. No one today ever makes enough or has enough. Everybody feels sorry for himself or herself. Everyone analyzes their lives and always finds something lacking. By today’s standards, it would be inhumane to live the way millions of us lived. Most people are still kind and decent, but thanks to the internet, we hear about all the cruelty, starvation, violence and insanity in every corner of the world. We hear every lunatic’s rants, every serial killer’s manifesto, every war, skirmish, every act of bigotry, of infanticide, of rape, murder and suicide an hour after it happens. We spend our time grieving, arguing, and fighting each other not to drown in the sea of inhumanity we seem to be swimming in. Are things better now? Not to this child of the ‘50s.

Even the poorest people I know have access to running water. In the big cities in the 1960s, most people had running water. We had a pump outside. We thought my grandparents were wealthy because they had a pump inside. That was not odd in small towns and rural areas in the 1960s.Guess what else when you only have water outsideHaving been alive for most of the 60s, which means people only slightly older than I grew up in the 50s, I must say.What are you talking about life being easier in the 50s and 60s?As I look around my house, I think of the most basic things.Let’s start with running water.

We thought my grandparents were wealthy because they had a pump inside. That was not odd in small towns and rural areas in the 1960s.Guess what else when you only have water outside? You don’t have a toilet inside. You have an outhouse a distance from the back door. Pretty inconvenient and very stinky.Definitely no television in the 1950s. A lot of people had it in the 60s but we got it around 1973 or so.Telephone. I almost typed a curse. Everybody on the county was on the same line. Even in the city, the whole block was on the same line and to call a block over cost $3-$5 per minute. It was fun to listen to everyone else’s conversations and talk to the operator. However, kids got in big trouble for touching a phone.Travel. Many fewer people had automobiles. There was usually one old car per family, which really wan’t that old because cars rusted out after 5–6 years. Plane travel was much nicer than now, but a ticket cost two month’s salary. Cars did not have air conditioning. Music came from a rattling speaker in the middle of dashboard, AM only. People were used to walking many miles and carrying stuff. Cars were death traps. Nobody heard of a seat belt or padded seats. Power steering and brakes were also a luxury. You had things like “Three on the tree” stick shifts and “suicide knobs” on the steering wheels. All of these added to the danger. If you had a four wheel drive vehicle, which was common in the country, you had to get out of the vehicle to lock the wheel hubs in bad weather.Mail order. The standard line when you bought something was, “Allow 6–8 weeks for delivery.” You had to plan your summer purchases in winter, fall purchases in spring, etc. Unless you were in Bentonville Arkansas or Troy Michigan, there were no Walmarts or KMarts. You got a catalog in the mail. then you picked out the stuff you wanted and hand wrote and order form. Then you had to go to the Post Office and mail it. Or you could wait to you went to a store like Sears and drop it off. Some items shipped to your house. With others, you got a letter which said you had so many days to go and pick them up. I remember ordering things that I forgot I ordered by the time they arrived.Food. You made your own. In the country that also meant killing and skinning your own protein or picking your own vegetables. There were not many supermarkets, even in the large cities. You went to a corner store in the city. The store only sold meat, or vegetables or baked goods. In the country, you went to a nearby town once a month or so to go to the general store. There were no microwaves. You pretty much had to plan an hour per day per meal to prepare your food.No power anything. Mowing the lawn, shoveling snow, trimming trees, carpentry, you name it was all done with hand tools. Everything took ten times as long.Face to face. All business had to be conducted face to face. Remember the phone? You couldn’t call a work person or order items or whatever. there was no amazon. If you needed to hire a carpenter, you had to go to the carpenter’s shop or house. You paid by cash or check. there were no online payments or cards.I think what happens is that people watch television shows like Leave it to Beaver, My Three Sons or Father Knows Best and think that is the 1950s and 1960s. From my experience, those people lived like what we call the “1%” nowadays. You would have to be extremely wealthy in 1965 to afford the type of lifestyle you see on these shows. They all also seemed to end up in Hawaii. I had relatives that were considered relatively wealthy. They couldn’t afford to go to Hawaii until the 1980s, when competition brought down airline tickets and computers at travel agencies made comparison shopping possible. Plane tickets also had to be purchased face to face. This meant driving to the airport and paying with cash. Then it was near impossible to comparison shop unless you lived in Los Angeles, New York or Chicago. Your local airport may only have one or two airlines from which to choose in the 50s and 60s.That just reminded me of another thing in the 1960s. To learn the simplest bit of information, you had to make a drive to a city with a decent sized public library. That was about 3 hours each way for us.Life was definitely not easier.",0 followers,Joseph Fabian,8K,2.3K,2.9M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Whats-the-best-book-I-should-read-about-the-Apollo-missions-from-a-technical-perspective

We had enough money that may people bought new cars every two or three years, and models changed almost yearly.The next Republican president,, Nixon, resigned from office to avoid being impeached. During the intervening years, the cost of living continued to increase but minimum wages did not. Corporate taxes were decreased.The situation continued to deteriorate from the 80s until now. In the early 80s, the antitrust laws were implemented to break up AT&T, saying that the structure they had created was unfair to other companies trying to compete with them. Then the antitrust laws were rescinded, allowing companies to expand to entities like Google, Amazon, and megabanks, essentially creating a climate where the local stores and banks had little chance of competing. The S&L scandal during the Clinton administration did little to alleviate this.We went in 50 years to a country where everyone was considered, where everyone had a chance if they worked hard enough to what we have today, just the opposite: corporate taxes are practically nonexistent; the rich and big business pay a much lower tax rate in proportion to their incomes than the individual. The cost of living has soared to the point that an individual has to have at least two minimum wage jobs just to exist, much less support a family. We’re struggling for our very lives.The latest from D.C. is that the government wants to reduce benefits all the way around. Social Security, which is not in the general fund, is being attacked. Medicare benefits are threatened. Drug, hospital and medical costs have risen to the point that a serious illness can wipe out a family’s savings, and possibly their home. The current government is rescinding laws that protected us, or have appointed secretaries of departments who are in direct opposition to the mandate of that department. Senators and Representative now consider their elections to be permanent jobs, and spend much of the time they should devote to legislation to fundraising. Corporations and individuals who fund campaigns are favored by legislation.Corporations have instilled a culture where individuals are encouraged to spend more than they can afford. Housing costs have skyrocketed. Food costs are out of sight. Education has suffered, and college costs are outrageous. Corporations have cut staff to the bone, eliminating many services that benefitted us while sending upper management salaries out of sight. Jobs have been eliminated, so each individual is now responsible for the duties of two or three people.That’s why we’re so stressed.","3,059 followers",Anne Agard,7.3K,14K,10.7M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Whats-the-best-book-I-should-read-about-the-Apollo-missions-from-a-technical-perspective

Almost everyone who went to college has a large amount of student debt, to the point that they will be a decade or more behind their parents when it comes to basic milestones such as homeownership and having children. And they are essentially required to live in high-cost cities, because that’s where the jobs are (especially the jobs that enable them to repay any amount of their student loan debt).Healthcare, housing, education are all significantly more expensive today than they were a generation ago, let alone several generations (even adjusting for inflation). Sure there are places where that isn’t the case; I have family members who point to higher interest rates, for example, and also claim that housing isn't really that much more expensive. But they also live in rural and exurban places where someone early in their career wouldn’t have access to employment.I’m sure it was rough living in some backwater in the 1960s, but I think the question here is raising an important point that few baby boomers I know are willing to confront: upward mobility for the middle class is stalling for many people, and in many cases is going in reverse. I’m in my mid 30s, and aside from myself virtually every single person in my peer group is worse off than their parents were at the same age. Obviously that’s anecdotal, but this is a well-documented and widely reported phenomenon.

By competing for places to live immigrants enable landlords to raise rents.Third, the birth rate during the Great Depression and the Second World War was low. By 1974 the baby boomers were entering the job market in large numbers. Population growth has always been the enemy of affluence, although many people think a low birth rate is a sign of national decline, and a reason for increasing the birth rate, and/or the immigration rate.Fourth, computer technology and automation increase the relationship between intelligence and income.

Some will argue we had stronger unions, we had the GI Bill, subsidised housing loans, etc…The real reason was because we had a surplus in overall Gross National Production (GNP) that well exceeded our Gross Domestic Production (GDP). Now you may think so what or what does this have to do with the price of tea in China.I will elaborate. The US was living off the winning the war dividend and the Marshall Plan. The US was the only economy that hadn’t been bombed back into the Stone Age in WWII so the demand for US exports was extremely high (and the cost of raw goods imports were extremely low). We had a well-oiled industrial complex capable of switching from manufacturing war time goods to manufacturing less war time goods and more household goods, vehicles, and machinery. This all resulted in a very healthy tax base from higher tax rates for citizens, income from war bond repayments and repayments from Europe at a healthy interest rate. So the US had a surplus and could develop a strong consumer economy.The government had been concerned with what happened after WWI when the soldiers came back and the job closed down and women were let go from working the factories of war. This ultimately put pressure on the market culminating in the Great Depression. So to avoid this the government had to create a demand for industrial production (after all it wasn’t like the major powers would have the money for war machines). The solution was to create a consumer driven economy and to convert most of the war machine manufacturing into retail goods manufacturing. This worked initially until the recession of July 1959.The problem was that the world had worked hard at paying off its war time debt back to the US, Japan and Germany paid off much faster than expected and in the meantime were now manufacturing the retail goods cheaper than the US turning the US from being a major exporter into a major import (because now everyone needed a washer and dryer, a compact radio, a hair dryer, toaster, dishwasher, and all the mod cons (modern conveniences). Made in Germany started out as cheap, but quickly became known for quality that exceeded what was being built in the US for the price point. You could get the same quality, but US labour costs and markups made it not possible to compete with the imports. So the US started the long and steady loss of manufacturing jobs and the rise of retail and service jobs.The Space Race was in reality the last big hurrah for massive government spending (and the draining of the national coffers) to try and re-inject the manufacturing industry in the US, the dividend did pay off for a while, but the US never came up with another such solution, instead it turned to cashing out and outsourcing and now has turned to automating out.The problem is the American Dream is frankly an unsustainable model both environmentally and economically. The consumer based economy gets only one tax cycle from the sale of foreign made goods, where the manufacturing based economy gave on average a three cycle taxing. So even though tax rate can be lower in that case, the fact that it is primarily now a services and retail economy, the tax rates need to drastically increase to provide the same benefit that people had in the 50s and 60s, in essence, the US has to produce what the world wants, and the world is done with wanting more war and more war machines, they can’t afford fossil fuel driven cars, other than planes and entertainment, the US isn’t making what the world wants and/or they can make it themselves domestically now with their own full-fledged industries.It is harder because the entire nation is quarterly profit driven, rather than long-term planning, it is so focused on the rights of the individual that it has forgotten to maintain the benefits of a society and the identity of a global community. It is no longer the land of opportunity when it is locking away child refugees in cages.What makes it harder now compared to the 50s and 60s is that there isn’t a foreign debt that needs to be paid back to the US, there isn’t a demand for US exports like after WWII (compared to imports), there isn’t an investment in future generations, but rather a straddling of fees and bond debts passed on to future generations in order for baby boomers to be able to retire on few children who became workers to pay into the funds. There is more than one retiring baby boomer to every working Gen X and when you throw in the Millennials who are straddled with the debt the baby boomers dumped at their feet, they aren’t able to make ends meet AND still pay for retirement possible for boomers.The people growing up in the 50s and 60s never accounted for smaller families resulting in fewer workers to pay into the economy which would have needed to be offset with higher taxes, but politically the only option was lower taxes and more hidden fees and less services instead. That well of tricks has now run dry, savings are non-existent and the illusion of home ownership security is also not suckering in Millennials the way it has Boomers and Gen X folks.The party is over and the Millennials and Gen X folks have been left to foot the bill sooner than the Boomers thought would happen. They thought they would get through and get the same ride the War Generation got, but they are coming up short, hence why it seems harder. In reality it has been too easy and the leadership of the Boomers failed to address the issues and have made it harder for all because of the lack of willingness to make the politically and social hard decisions and instead kicked the can to future generations.",0 followers,Daisy Tudor,1.4K,3.8K,1.5M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Why-is-American-life-so-much-harder-than-it-was-in-the-50s-and-60s

The treatments then were not particularly effective, and the medicines were nasty. Vaccines were just being developed, and I had, to my memory, both chicken pox and measles. I was fortunate to get the polio vaccine. A girl who was a little older than I was lived up the block. She walked with crutches and had braces on her legs from polio. When I was four and had to have my tonsils and adenoids out. The children's ward where I slept had two iron lungs in it, both ocuppied, and I was scared of them.When my dad retired we moved to rural NW Florida, where my paternal relatives lived. My grandmother had cold running water, but only in the kitchen, and we had to boil water on the stove. There was no bathroom. During the day, we walked to the outhouse and at night we pulled the enamel chamber pot out from under the bed. There was no heat except for a propane heater in the living room. And there was no air conditioning at all. My aunts and uncles did have real bathrooms, but still only cold water in the kitchens.TV was black and white, and unless you were lucky enough to live in a major city, you were lucky to get more than one channel, and it was ABC, CBS or NBC. We listened to Walter Cronkite or Huntley and Brinkley, and got to see such historical moments as black people being brutalized by sheriffs for such things as walking across a bridge or eating at a lunch counter. My mother sympathized, and said “Negro"". Most of my relatives used the “n-word"" and thought they got what was coming to them. In our rural 1-12 school (no “K"" in pblc school back then. It was there the students in our sixth grade class were brutalized by an abusive teacher. And back then it was perfectly all right for kids to miss days of school if they had to help out on the farm.Two years after my dad's retirement, he was killed in a workplace accident that could have been prevented by modern safety measures.I could go on. A lot of things were good. Kids had more freedom to play in safety. Life was simpler and there was not as much social pressure, and social media did not exist. The middle class was more prosperous relative to the upper class, another was moreupward mobility.The world is what it is. Older people have griped about the good old days and young people have complained about the old forties.But while nostalgia is nice on a personal level, it's silly to glamorize the past.

I think we had a gas stove.My dad had served in Britain and North Africa in WWII, and was only recently released from active service. He had degrees in English, French, Mathematics and Physics and had been an officer, but as a civilian, he was working first as a vacuum cleaner salesman and then as an exterminator.We moved from the trailer park to a place about 20 miles south of town, and I guess the folks sold the trailer. The place we moved to was several acres on a creek, and primitive. We eventually got a crank phone on a party line, but I don’t recall there being a refrigerator. Things were kept cool in the spring house (from which we extracted water using a hand pump on the summer porch) I don’t think there was indoor plumbing. At least I don’t remember any. Dad worked, mom planted a garden with corn, cucumbers, tomatoes and string beans, we got milk from a herd of goats, and there was an occasional trip to town for groceries in the single car we had. I think there was an electric line to the house that provided light at night and power for the ringer washer. For really difficult stains, Mom used a pair of wash tubs and a washboard before putting the item(s) in the washer. I recall replacing or covering the tin roof on the place with plywood and roll-out roofing (tar paper with a mineral coating on one side). Both cooking and heat in the winter were provided by coal. Coal furnace and coal stove.When my dad got a better job offer several states away, the car was sold in favor of a Jeep station wagon, and the folks bought and outfitted an old school bus. Bunks, a pot-belly stove, fold-down table, etc. We “caravaned” with the goats in tow. We drove to the new town near the Gulf Coast where my dad had his first job in aerospace (that’s what he did the rest of his life), parked with permission on a farm where a house was being refinished/repaired, and spent the first winter in the bus. All us kids got chickenpox. We moved into the farm house (crank phone and indoor plumbing) when it was finished, but it turned out that job only lasted 18 months, because the missile contract wound up. Next, we caravaned to northern California, where dad worked for the next ten years.I have to say, when we were in the Midwest and the South (more the South) the racism was so thick you could cut it with a knife. We once gave an old black lady a ride into town, and she insisted we let her out before we reached the town proper, so that no one would see that she had had the nerve to ride in a car with white people. She was terrified. California, at least, was more forward-thinking.In California, 1960, we had our first taste of “modern” life. Our own dial phone on a private line, electricity, even a TV for a while, we put in an electric pump to get us water from the canal above the house, had indoor plumbing with septic, a radio, record player, all the conveniences. We still gardened and raised chickens, kept an apple and pear orchard, etc. But we didn’t have to. I had a bike and a paper route. We could go to the movies pretty often, buy model airplanes and toy vinyl dinosaurs, and things a kid today would recognize. Mom cut our hair with electric clippers. Big fridge full of stuff from the local Safeway and Lucky for $40.00 every two weeks. Mom still baked our bread, but - hey.By the time we moved to Arizona for the next job in aerospace, “modernity” had set in. TV, washer/dryer, push-button phone, electric everything, etc., etc. I worked my first 3 “real” jobs there and bought, in succession, a Honda 50, a ’60 “bug,” a ’60 Dodge Dart, and a ’68 Buick GS 400. Only ever owned one at a time.The 50’s and 60’s were over, everything was getting easier, and everything was getting more complicated.Now we have cell phones with calculators, address books, calendars, cameras and video cams on them, computers, GPS, sat phones, hybrid cars, electric juicers, satellite TV, huge hi-res flat panel TVs that cost a fraction what our old 24″ console did, microwaves and every kind of pre-cooked food, laser levels, top-cons (a machine on a tripod that can make digital 3D models of anything), scanners, 3D printers, video phoning, smart-speaker home assistants, LED lighting, solar-powered homes, etc., etc.My own job can now be done in half the time (or less) with half the effort that it took as late as the early 80’s.Telexes, faxes, mimeo machines, digital organizers, and other modern wonders I never dreamed of as a child are nowBut starting adult life is much harder now (we bought our first house when we were 22 and our kids, actually more prosperous than we were, had to wait to their 30’s), because wages have not kept pace with ballooning costs, and parents insulating kids from the world is much more prevalent.And the degree of conflict and stress dogging our every day lives has grown exponentially.So life is miles easier - and much “harder.”",0 followers,Alex Mara,771,5.4K,2.7M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Why-is-American-life-so-much-harder-than-it-was-in-the-50s-and-60s

TheAlsoIt was always the plan to land numerous times, in different kinds of places. The moon has different types of landscape, just as the Earth does. TheAlso, remember that the first Apollo landing mission — Apollo 11 — included only a single very short moonwalk. The Apollo 11 Lunar Module spent less than a day on the surface, and the moonwalk was only a couple of hours, into which they also had to cram ceremonial activities, such as reading the plaque and a telephone call from the U.S. President. In that time, they collected less than 50 pounds of samples. Imagine if explorers had landed in North America, spent an afternoon walking around the beach, and then left, never to return.Every later Apollo mission spent longer on the moon, some as long as 3 days. The last three missions brought along a lunar rover — a small electric car that enabled each crew to explore a far larger area. Every Apollo mission brought back more samples than the previous missions — in fact, just the last two missions brought back over half the total of the entire program. By the end of the program, the Apollo crews had brought back 840 pounds of rock and regolith samples.Apollo 15 brought back the oldest known rock — 4.1 billion years old — nicknamed the Genesis rock.Finally, it’s important to realize that landing on the moon six times didn’t cost six times as much as one landing. Most of the cost of the Apollo program was the same whether we landing once or twenty times. The construction of the Vehicle Assembly Building, the launch pads, Mission Control, the Deep Space Network, the computer software, the design of the Saturn V, Apollo spacecraft, and Lunar Module — all of these costs were about the same regardless of the number of flights.For example, the cost of the entire Saturn V program was about $6.4 billion. However, each individual launch cost “only” about $185 million.While there were certainly more places on the moon that we wanted to explore, Apollo did a pretty good job of surveying a variety of locations.
