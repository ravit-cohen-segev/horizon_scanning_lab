There I amazed the locals with my insistence on using a strange outmoded form of transport known as “walking”. Locals would slow down as they passed in their modern cars, pointing and laughing. To them, it must have been like watching a live action version of the Flintstones.3) Voting – would you believe it, but in the UK we still vote by drawing a little X next to the candidate we want to vote for. No sign of the advanced electronic voting they have over in the states. Indeed, we are so old fashioned that we haven’t even outsourced our voting to the Russians yet!4) Guns – It may be hard for an American to believe but almost nobody in the UK owns their own guns. This means that if we have to rise up and overthrow our own government (currently seems like a good plan) then we will be armed with nothing more than some particularly well sharpened sarcasm.Still, perhaps one day we can hope to be as advanced as the US.

Sure, fear of the USSR and saber rattling got the ball rolling, but fundamentally, we went to the moon becauseBut also, the Apollo program sort of shot itself in the foot. By publicly committing the nation to a landing by the end of the decade, President Kennedy set in motion a political monster that gobbled up resources at an alarming rate. Development had to start while basic research was still going on. Engines had to be chosen before spacecraft designs were in hand. Critical systems had not just built-in redundancy, but whole redundant systems using different technologies in case the primary didn’t work out. And instead of designing reusable vehicles and assembling missions from multiple launches of smaller, more manageable boosters, we built the biggest baddest rocket the world has ever seen—and made it disposable.It took half a million people and the combined military and industrial resources of the wealthiest nation on Earth to put the first boot prints on the moon. And while we were getting there, the Space Nuclear Propulsion Office, in concert with Los Alamos and the Marshall Space Flight Center, developed an atomic rocket engine called NERVA and started talking it up as the power plant for manned exploration of Mars.It would have been awesome, but congress wasn’t about to pay for it. They strangled NERVA, canceled Apollo, and gave NASA far more humble objectives to last the next generation.It’s a mixed bag. The impetus of the moon shot is still felt today in ways that most people aren’t aware of—not in the invention of the Space Pen or Velcro (neither of which were developed by NASA) but in the shape and capability of our industry and institutions of research and learning. Apollo helped send Voyager to Saturn, Sojorner to Mars, and Elon Musk into the space ferry business.And now here we are. Many of the cutting edge military-grade technologies that went into Apollo are now standard aerospace tech. Many of the technologies and fabrication techniques developed for Apollo are antiquated and out of date. And now, private industry is talking about sending mankind back to the moon and beyond.No one can say whether we’d be farther ahead or farther behind without Apollo. But I can say this: We did a great, bold, noble, and honorable thing, and we did it exceptionally well.

Comprehensively.[1]Now, let’s look at the superior technologies that we really do have. Here’s the thing: they don’t really help all with the problem all that much.Computing isn’t a big deal. I can do the necessary calculations on a $10 microcontroller card. I can add really fancy graphics if I use a $40 card named for a dessert dish. Space-rated computing hardware is expensive because it has to be built with traceable, high reliability components. A lot of times, they have to use radiation-hardened components. After building it all, it has to be tested to exacting standards. Such things are hideously expensive.Modern materials technologies would help, and we would shed mass from all kinds of parts. Unfortunately, we wouldn’t dare use some of the newest materials. It’s the same problem as before: everything built for space has to be well-tested, well-understood and reliable. Many really great materials just aren’t going to be suitable for space applications.Where there could be a really big bonus in materials is in the pressure suits and lunar EVA suits. We could make them lighter, tougher, and less uncomfortable. We probably couldn’t increase individual EVA times, as the astronauts were pretty exhausted at the end of the long EVAs. Perhaps we could have a few more EVAs.Power generation technologies have improved, so we could probably provide more compact and reliable batteries, fuel cells, and solar arrays. That certainly helps, but what it means is that the safety margins could be improved from “this is really, crazy dangerous” to “this is pretty dangerous.”Rocket technologies have improved quite a bit, but it’s not as big a factor as you’d think. Cryogenic fuels are still difficult to store and handle in space. Hypergolic fuels are still the same combinations we used 50 years ago. The only real difference is that we’d have to add a lot more equipment for safety requirements. We were really too cavalier about those fuels back then. Again, we’ve become more safety conscious, so what we’d probably achieve is better safety margins more than big capability improvements.Finally, space flight is extremely expensive. When you put humans into that equation, it becomes more expensive and yet still dangerous. No government has thought it worth the effort, the expense, and the political capital to repeat human spaceflight to the Moon.You can argue about the merits of that decision — argue endlessly, I imagine. That doesn’t change the reality, though. We went to the Moon. Then we got tired of it. That’s pretty much it in a nutshell.[1] To the the folks who want to say I’m wrong/nuts/deluded/a shill/<insert assessment>, don’t bother. I’ve heard it all.

But NASA took the goal set by President Kennedy - to reach the moon by the end of the decade - very, very,So NASA designed Apollo to be a disposable system. Start with a big-a$$ rocket and throw all the parts away as you use them until you are left with a bare tin can full of astronauts and rocks returning by parachute and nothing left in the gas tank, not fumes, not even the tank. When you design a transportation system that literally consumes itself as it works, you are left with no infrastructure to build on.",295 followers,Barry Davidoff,6.3K,941,3.6M,2016,https://www.quora.com/Could-another-Earth-have-developed-similar-advanced-technologies-like-us-but-differently

And much, much, more.The fact that one person, Elon Musk, is involved in doing many of the things I mention is less a matter of his brilliance—though he is quite smart—and more a proof of how little it takes to actually make progress. He has access to a large amount of concentrated capital, but there are plenty of ways to allow groups of people to pool their resources just as effectively. So, let’s go back to the Moon. And to Mars. And to the bottom of the ocean and every other place that tickles our curiosity.

25,"We DID land on the moonSome specialised observatories regularly illuminate corner reflectors that astronauts left on the moon. These shine laser beams and view the reflected signal in telescopes.

Less people involved, less evidence to hide, less lies to cover up.If we didn’t go, why is it still a secret?The American government has released plenty of secret information about experiments on the general public and assassination attempts in other countries. Why would this one pointless thing remain secret? The amount of money required to hide it this long, would out way the funds they gained at the time. Hiding it just wouldn’t be worth the effort involved.The only reason we don’t go there, is there’s no point. The moon is a barren landscape, with no easily accessible resources. We’ve got all the samples we need, there are no experiments we can’t replicate on the ISS (international space station).Actually, I’m guessing the amount of money, time and effort required to deny the moon landings, could, if all added together, actually finance another moon landing.Brings up a good point. Almost all the moon landing deniers have expertise in space travel. Why not spend their time productively working out ways to make it cheaper and safer. Make it cheap and safe enough, we might even get investors for holiday trips to the moon :)",UNKNOWN,Robert Frost,1.6K,9.4K,195.6M,2016,https://www.quora.com/Could-another-Earth-have-developed-similar-advanced-technologies-like-us-but-differently

28,"There are many reasons, mainly the facts that:so in the 60s obviously the us government pumped a lot of money into nasa to fund landing on the moon.

They didn't do this for science or to help humanity reach for the stars and explore, they did it because Russia had beaten them to stable orbit, beaten them to the first man to Eva in space etc and could not allow them to be the first to land a man on the moon. Now when America proved it had the largest manhood in this area, naturally the government saw little more reason to fund nasa and so cut their funding by a lot.The saturn rockets cost an insane amount of money to build and they are a 1 use throw away object that cannot be re-used. Elon musk actually found that most of the cost was down to the fact that nasa contracted out the building of most of the parts for the rockets they use so they are built y the likes of Lockheed Martin etc and they charge a lot more money than it actually costs. This is why space x (one of two companies nasa uses to launch its supply missions to the iss) invested money into learning how to build their own rockets thus cutting costs.space x also found that the technology used to build rockets until very recently hasn't actually changed an awful lot since the 60s, an no effort was made to beat the main cost which is the fact that the vehicle is a one use only thing. This is why space x have been working so hard to design rocket boosts than can land themselves after they detach from the space craft to be used on later flights, something they have succeeded in and I'm not sure on exact numbers but space x actually now he more advanced rockets than nasa that are built way way more cheaply because they are 1) built totally in house 2) use more modern technology and 3) are starting to become more re-usable.so they reasons we havnt been back aren't because humanity is stupid it's because nasa does not have the funds to launch manned missions to the moon anymore using current technology, there is no will for the powers that hold the money to return thus until nasa and space x advance a little bit more toward building cheaper reusable rockets that will bring the cost down to a manageable amount, I don't think we will mare frequent return missions for a while.","35,155 followers",C Stuart Hardwick,3.8K,12.3K,142.9M,2016,https://www.quora.com/Could-another-Earth-have-developed-similar-advanced-technologies-like-us-but-differently
