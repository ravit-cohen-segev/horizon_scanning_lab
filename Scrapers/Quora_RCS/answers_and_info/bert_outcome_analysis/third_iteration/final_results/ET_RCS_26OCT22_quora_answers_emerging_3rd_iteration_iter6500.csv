So, it is more likely that they will enact laws to require brain implants so that they can control us. Words from Nacy Pelosi's mouth from an in-person meeting, “Someone has to tell people what to do.” That is in response to why did she get into politics.The same body of government voted to have the Internet be imbalanced. Another step in taking away any equality that the technology is supposed to bring. I made a note to the Feinstein office that the Internet is already unequal since the download speeds are always higher than the upload speeds. And, that gives the power to phone companies. So, I was telling the staffer, that since we have quarter-sized web servers, any mom and pop should be able to set up a web server farm in their kitchen drawer. I don’t think they heard me.But, we really do want Mom and Pop to set up a web server farm in their kitchen drawer. We want as much of that as possible.Now, competition is a serious thing in business. In spite of what government we have, if people can find a better way with new technology, they will go out and get it. In Russia, before the wall fell, there was no food in the stores. People waited in lines for hours for a few loaves of bread. After the wall fell, soon after, weeks, the stores were full of food. Did Russian people starve so that they could have a totalitarian government? Apparently, not.We continue downsizing computers. And, networks are easier and easier to set up. We can do a lot in a watch now. But, for all we think of, we have to consider finger size, the optical resolutions of the eyes, the weight of what we carry. So, physically, it might not change too much.But, think of digital paper. Carry it along in your pocket, roll it up. Roll it out on a table, get a big screen that weighs a few ounces.I can imagine drones tagging along.The cell network is actually kind of limited. I admit that I was surprised when I climbed to the top of a mountain at Crater Lake last year and from the top of the mountain, I sent a picture to a friend. So, that mountain was close enough to civilization for cell phone connectivity. But, many are not.Some people have satellite phones. They are expensive. But, prices drop rapidly in all types of technology. So, in twenty years, someone might be able to pull out the digital paper and send a picture to a friend from Mount Everest.But, if the physical devices become more magical, like real crystal balls, the evolution of software will have to keep going.We are approaching the limit of Moore’s law. At some point, when people agree there is a limit, the price, and pervasiveness of the limited devices will have to come down. Software will finally have to be efficient. On top of the improved software, the way the software interacts with people will have to improve considerably.An interesting change recently is in Bluetooth. Better sound compressions and technology that will allow for form instance groups. So, a group of kids shows up at a park and can have an instant music sharing session or a flash performance or something. This is just a few years away.Perhaps VR will be part of mobile as well.Lots of possibilities.

The best futurists such as Asimov or Kurzweil take a look back at what has lead up to current technology, factors that have caused it to come about (or has held it back) and then extrapolate into the future. The one thing that has been taking place in (computing) technology is Moore’s Law: computing power generally doubles every few years with the cost dropping by about half.With that being said, you also have to take into account all the wildcard factors: politics, economics, war, natural disasters, etc. Any one of these can hold back or actually hasten technology development. I understand a valid argument would be that over a period of 20 years these would all even out. However, look at something like the current Covid-19 pandemic that is only 6 months along with the “end” still unknown. There’s the possible resurgence. Over the next 20 years, it’s likely we’ll have something even worse.Back to your question specifically, most likely just about everything we use in 20 years from now will be “mobile technology.” We’ll probably be up to something like “10G” or “15G” or whatever they will be calling it.

They have been found in Arslantepe, Turkey, are made from arsenical bronze, and are about 60 cm (24 in) long. Some of them are inlaid with silver.Sword production in China is attested from the Bronze Age Shang Dynasty.. The technology for bronze swords reached its high point during the Warring States period and Qin Dynasty. Amongst the Warring States period swords, some unique technologies were used, such as casting high tin edges over softer, lower tin cores, or the application of diamond shaped patterns on the blade.In the Indian subcontinent, earliest available Bronze age swords of copper were discovered in the Indus Valley Civilization sites in the northwestern regions of South Asia. Swords have been recovered in archaeological findings throughout the Ganges-Jamuna Doab region of Indian subcontinent, consisting of bronze but more commonly copper.Diverse specimens have been discovered in Fatehgarh, where there are several varieties of hilt. These swords have been variously dated to times between 1700–1400 BC, but were probably used more in the opening centuries of the 1st millennium BC.Iron became increasingly common from the 13th century BC. Before that the use of swords was less frequent. The iron was not quench-hardened although often containing sufficient carbon, but work-hardened like bronze by hammering. This made them comparable or only slightly better in terms of strength and hardness to bronze swords. They could still bend during use rather than spring back into shape. But the easier production, and the better availability of the raw material for the first time permitted the equipment of entire armies with metal weapons, though Bronze Age Egyptian armies were sometimes fully equipped with bronze weapons.As steel technology improved, single-edged weapons became popular throughout Asia. Derived from the Chinese Jian or dao, the Korean hwandudaedo are known from the early medieval Three Kingdoms. Production of the Japanese tachi, a precursor to the katana, is recorded from c. AD 900 ( Japanese sword).Japan was famous for the swords it forged in the early 13th century for the class of warrior-nobility known as the Samurai. The types of swords used by the Samurai included the ōdachi (extra long field sword), tachi (long cavalry sword), katana (long sword), and wakizashi (shorter companion sword for katana). Japanese swords that pre-date the rise of the samurai caste include the tsurugi (straight double-edged blade) and chokutō (straight one-edged blade). Japanese swordmaking reached the height of its development in the 15th and 16th centuries, when samurai increasingly found a need for a sword to use in closer quarters, leading to the creation of the modern katana.Western historians have said that Japanese katana were among the finest cutting weapons in world military history.In Indonesia, the images of Indian style swords can be found in Hindu gods statues from ancient Java circa 8th to 10th century. However the native types of blade known as kris, parang, klewang and golok were more popular as weapons. These daggers are shorter than sword but longer than common dagger.The earliest evidence of curved swords, or scimitars (and other regional variants as the Arabian saif, the Persian shamshir and the Turkic kılıç) is from the 9th century, when it was used among soldiers in the Khurasan region of Persia which was under Turkic rule.The takoba is a type of broadsword originating in the Sahel, descended from the various Byzantine and Islamic swords used across North Africa. Strongly associated with the Tuaregs, it has a straight double-edged blade measuring about 1 meter in length, usually imported from Europe. The hilt has a short, usually simple crossguard either covered in leather or decorative metal plates (typically brass) and a large pommel. The smiths of these swords formed a separate caste, with their own language, and did not intermarry with the Tuaregs.Within the Ottoman Empire, the use of a curved sabre called the Yatağan started in the mid-16th century. It would become the weapon of choice for many in Turkey and the Balkans.As can be seen from the forms of swords, some of the designs migrated between cultures, but many have developed within the local culture. Indonesian swords are rather different from Indian, African swords display a big diversity.To my taste, the best ever material was Damascus Steel. The steel is named after Damascus, the capital city of Syria and one of the largest cities in the ancient Levant. It may either refer to swords made or sold in Damascus directly, or it may just refer to the aspect of the typical patterns, by comparison with Damask fabrics (which are themselves named after Damascus).Damascus steel was the forged steel comprising the blades of swords smithed in the Near East from ingots of Wootz stee imported from India and Sri Lanka. These swords are characterized by distinctive patterns of banding and mottling reminiscent of flowing water, or in a ""ladder"" or ""teardrop"" pattern. Such blades were reputed to be tough, resistant to shattering, and capable of being honed to a sharp, resilient edge.It is an extreme pleasure to hammer two pieces of steel to a knife we call Damascene. It takes three days to produce a small knife. I never tried to produce a sword. It would equal a blasphemy.",0 followers,Lincoln Spaur,998,80,1.4M,2019,https://www.quora.com/How-advanced-will-mobile-technology-be-in-20-years

We know that in the middle ages it was possible to get swords from different areas, think about the crusades and probably also Indian blades coming to Europe, but the main designs were generally region-specific and stayed that way.
