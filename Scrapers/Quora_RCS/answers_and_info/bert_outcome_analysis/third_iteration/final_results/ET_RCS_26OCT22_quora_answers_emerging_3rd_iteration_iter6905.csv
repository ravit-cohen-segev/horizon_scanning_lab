Instead of saying what you have to do, I’m going to say how I ended up with 30lpa so that you can pick up a thing or two.Year 2012: CTC 5lpaI graduated from one of the top tier colleges in India but I am not from a Computer Science background, since I had interest in programming I joined a company as Software Engineering Trainee 4 years ago with a package of 5 lpa. To most it might seem very good as a fresher but coming from my institute where the average salary is like 8–9 lpa, this was quite low.My relatives used to say to my parents while I was in college “All your financial problems would be solved, just wait for your son to graduate, he will easily earn 1 lakh per month given how talented he is”. Although my parents never said anything, they were hoping I’d graduate with a very good salary.But I did not, with all the variable pay, I used to get a mere 30k per month with no benefits. I was away from home, was sending back home a mere 10k per month, it was definitely not what I planned when I joined that prestigious college. I felt pretty dejected by the fact that despite graduating from a top tier institute I was sending home mere 10k per month.All this because, I was not from a Computer Science background. And it is true, I did not know anything beyond C & a bit of data structures, I deserved such pay for the skills I had. But I was highly ambitious like you, never say that earning 30 lpa is a unrealistic dream.I knew one thing that I’m not so great at Computer Science, so I said I am going to fix this. I did dream of higher salaries but in my dreams higher salary was like 11 lpa, I was very modest back then. I was working as a full stack web developer, I was told to learn so many technologies both in frontend & backend. While all my office colleagues used to party during weekends, I used to confine myself to my room. I had read so many blogs about improving my programming skills & one thing fit into my mind so well.You can only get good at programming by coding as much as you can aka practice.Going through a DSA book & solving problems was not my forte. So, I started building my own personal web apps using the backend framework & frontend framework I was then working on. Whenever I used to stumble upon a issue I used to go through the documentation, stackoverflow & if none works, directly into the source code.Every day right after office, I used to have dinner & start coding. On weekends I used to code the entire day. The fact that I lived alone helped me so much in this because no one used to ask me to come to that stupid mall for the Nth time & live the programmed life.Year 2013: 6lpaSo, I kept doing this for almost a year. Now came the time for raise, my salary went from 5lpa to 6lpa. Although it felt great, it had nothing to do with the fact that my knowledge of the tech has improved!As the time progressed, I even learnt about new upcoming frameworks, I got my hands dirty with them. I used to read blog articles, I used to try the new frameworks. And when I was in office, I used to incorporate few design patterns in our own projects based on what I learned from other frameworks. I even had an habit of going through the source code, I used to be very active on StackOverflow answering questions. During this whole time, I wasn’t even thinking about my salary, I was so involved in learning. I was like a child, if you had asked me what is that I want to learn I’d have said everything. To paint the picture I was learning Web design, Ruby on Rails, HTML5 & CSS3(new APIs were released back then), MongoDb, NodeJS & BackboneJS simultaneously. Although in my office I was working on a different tech stack.Do not confine yourself to a single programming language or a single framework.Going through the source code & trying different programming languages taught me various design patterns. They also taught me to write code that is readable & testable. I used to refactor the code in my company all the time because I didn’t like the code I’d written few months ago.If you look at the code you’ve written in the past & think it is awful. Congratulations, you’re evolving as a programmer!I was becoming the goto guy in the office eventually for all the difficult bugs or stories. But it was easier for me because, some of the problems I had solved in one of my side projects that I was working on during the weekends. Some bugs people had almost no clue of but I could say exactly what was going on in one shot because I happened to read about that in a blog post.Year 2014: 6.5lpa to 9lpaBut I realised the company I was working for didn’t realise my contribution because it was evident from my next raise which was mere 6 lpa to 6.5lpa. So, I decided to switch, I moved to Bangalore as a Frontend Engineer. Without even negotiating I was offered 9 lpa. It was a huge moment for me, I was ridiculously happy! I was thinking of negotiating to like 7–7.5 but they didn’t even ask what I’m making, they liked my performance in the interview & offered 9lpa because everybody were being paid the sameIf you feel you’re being underpaid, switch immediately.With new raise, I was even more motivated. My lifestyle did not change, I kept building those side projects. This time for a change, I started contributing on Github, first I used to fix small bugs. And then one of my open source project got quite popular.Eventually I started getting emails on linkedin & gmail about how companies want someone like me in their team. Although I rejected most of them because I didn’t want to switch just for the sake of higher salary, it felt quite good because you’re now on the other side where companies are looking for you rather than you looking for them. And all this happened because of the profile I had build over the 2 years on StackOverflow & Github.Having a great Github/StackOverflow profile helps so much for you to the extent that companies would apply to you instead of you applying to themYear 2015: 15lpaOne year later due to a family issue I had to move to my hometown. And since I didn’t find any high paying companies which are not MNCs, I decided to work from home. I applied to companies based in US hoping I’d get paid in dollars but I got an offer from one company which was willing to pay me 15lpa. It was huge boost almost 67% raise.Not joining big companies during my early stages has been invaluable because I could learn so much in very less time & make huge impact. Do not worry about the social status that nobody has heard the name of your company, it doesn’t matter in a long run!It was a small startup, since I had knowledge across multiple domains. Despite being a frontend engineer, I used to give valuable inputs in design, backend api design etc. I thought I would just be delivering features on the frontend but turns out I had to rewrite the whole frontend from scratch. I hadn’t architected any project before, so I went through various articles/blogs, their thinking process, their mistakes. Eventually I ended up doing quite better than what I had expected. I then bought some books about designing scalable applications & refactored code accordingly.Sometimes you’d be presented with tasks which might ask you to punch above your weight. Accept them immediately, this is your moment of glory. Contrary to what our mind tricks us into believing, we’ll do just fine!Meanwhile i had gotten emails from some US based firms about how they are willing to pay me USD 85k per annum for working remotely. I politely said no because as usual I didn’t want to switch just for the sake of higher pay & I was loving my job (Some might call this as a mistake but I didn’t find it right thing to do). But this increased my confidence too much that I felt my value is even higher than 15lpaYear 2016: 30lpaIt was the time for raise, so I told them how I was contributing across various domains, So I’d want a salary of 30lpa and shares in the company. After a week of thought, they agreed to it! I couldn’t believe that moment, because in 4 years my salary literally became 6X.I felt like a superstar, my parents had got tears of joy after listening to this!If the work you do is valuable, companies won’t even bargain when you ask for a raiseAll this happened because I did not waste my free time & used to improve my skills, this would be my one line advice for youThere are so many programmers but quality programmers are still a rare commodity & companies would be more than happy to pay you the amount you did not even dream of . Focus on improving your skills, salary will follow you like the Vodafone dogThings I missed uponTo achieve all this I had to sacrifice many things but I don’t regret them at allI’m not saying one shouldn’t enjoy life or all of the above things are bad but I can do all of these now! TV Series can wait, relationships can wait, social life can wait. After all these years, I feel I am in a more settled position, so yes now I will start enjoying my weekends, I’ll focus on other aspects of my life finally!All it took me was to sacrifice 1–2 years of my social life! Your time at this age is very precious because you’re high on energy better not waste them procrastinating.P.S:Edit:I’ve been getting a lot of questions asking about the books/blogs that I followed & how I got ideas for side projects, here’s the link to that commenthttps://www.quora.com/How-do-I-get-a-package-of-30-laks-per-annum/answers/28583963/comment/24678593?__filter__=1&__nsrc__=1&__snid3__=871899335",UNKNOWN,Anonymous,4.2K,0,0,2017,https://www.quora.com/I-am-currently-working-as-Python-and-PowerShell-developer-with-1-and-half-year-experience-What-other-courses-technologies-will-help-me-earn-good-money-in-the-IT-industry

Increase Your Productivity (The Speed with Which You Provide Value)The first way that you can earn more money is by increasing your ability to get sh*t done and provide value at a faster speed.Think about it this way…Imagine there are two people who are equally skilled at their job as creative writers.The first writer can write 1,000 words in 60 minutes.The second writer can write 2,500 words in 60 minutes.Who do you think will be more highly paid? Who do you think will get promoted?Obviously, the writer who can get twice as much work done in the same amount of time (this is especially true if you’re a freelancer or entrepreneur).Therefore, one of the best ways to get paid more is to increase your output by leveraging proven productivity tactics.I’ve written extensively about productivity here on Quora I’ll summarize my best points here:Implementing the above tips can help you increase your productivity by 50% or more.And once you are able to get more done in less time than your competitors or coworkers, you WILL start making more money.2. Increase Your Skills (The Level of Value You Bring)Once you are able to get more done in less time, you’ll want to find ways that you can get more done while simultaneously increasing the quality of the work that you’re accomplishing.To do this, you will need to adhere to three simple principles.When you commit to the process, educate yourself massively on your chosen field, and hire coaches to help you identify and eliminate your weaknesses, you will quickly rise to the top of your field and be able to demand any price that you want.3. Increase Your Status (The Perceived Value of Working with You)Have you ever watched Dr. Phil?He’s a marriage counselor, author, and TV personality with an estimated networth of about $400 million.An hour of counseling with Dr. Phil will run you… Oh, just a measly $40,000!Now let me ask you a question…The average marriage counselor charges between $75 and $150 an hour.That’s less than 10% of what it would cost you to work with Dr. Phil.But do you really think that Dr. Phil is 400x better than other marriage counselors?OF COURSE NOT!He might be good, but I promise he’s not that good.So how can he charge such an outrageous price?Simple… Because he’s increased his perceived status. (or value).And if you want to make more money, you must do the same thing.People want to work with high status people.Period.If you can increase your status by becoming a best selling author, driving a nicer car (e.g. Tai Lopez), setting public speaking engagements, and becoming a prolific creator on all major channels, then you can charge pretty much whatever you want.Not because you’re better than everyone else.But because the general publicYou can start small here.Upgrade your wardrobe, create more content and get it published on major blogs, write a book on Amazon, do small things that make you seem more high status.Eventually, you will reach a point where you never have to look for money again and you’ll have more business and opportunities than you know what to do with falling right into your lap.Hope this helpsStay Grounded,Want my best stuff on quora?Click here",UNKNOWN,Cory A.
