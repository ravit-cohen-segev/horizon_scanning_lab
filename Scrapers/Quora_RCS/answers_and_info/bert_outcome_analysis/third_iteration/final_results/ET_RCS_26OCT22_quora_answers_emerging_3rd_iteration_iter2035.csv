0,"It will certainly displace a lot. But there will also be new jobs never imagined. How many web designers were they 25 years ago. How many people employed in phone shops on your high street?A few people will get left behind, unable to do many of the new jobs. A few more will be not be able, or be unwilling, to be retrained. So there will be frictional costs from new technology. But I am confident that there will be new jobs, which we cannot imagine, in the future,","5,990 followers",Jens Böttiger,566,2.6K,17.6M,2018,https://www.quora.com/To-what-extent-will-advancements-in-technology-replace-human-workforce-in-the-upcoming-century

The jobs that areTo the extent to whichTo the extent to whichI disagree with the idea that automation will create a different class of jobs and lift everyone to some higher utopian society. That’s nonsense. The jobs that are currently being replaced by automation are often those held by the lowest class of labor. These people may not be trainable to work in more highly skilled jobs. There will always be people with lower IQs, learning disadvantages, or simply localization or other social challenges. Automation will not lift these people out of their challenges.",78 followers,Rajan Singh,1.5K,360,25.2M,2018,https://www.quora.com/To-what-extent-will-advancements-in-technology-replace-human-workforce-in-the-upcoming-century
2,"You don’t advance technology as a monolith. Germany is a leader in material science and mechanical engineering.Germany is sub-par in software engineering and in its physical communication infrastructure. This is in part due to persistent cultural wariness of surveillance technologies like social media.

Germany is not the most technologically advanced country. It could be pretty close, but there are major elements of society who dedicate themselves to making sure that Germany uses inferior technology that kills more people, damages the environment more, costs more money, and will cause the total collapse of Earth’s biosphere due to a runaway greenhouse effect. Mostly in the Green Party. Because radiation from nuclear accidents is apparently scarier than way more people dying of regular pollution constantly and the total annihilation of all life on Earth as the oceans boil away.","246,850 followers",Dushka Zapata,1.5K,8.5K,232.4M,2021,https://www.quora.com/To-what-extent-will-advancements-in-technology-replace-human-workforce-in-the-upcoming-century
3,"So I’ve seen a bunch of people asking this type of question. Each time I think of an answer the more I realize nothing is going to change. We still have common sicknesses. We don’t have cities on the moon. Our technology really actually sucks for human advancement. We still have wars, kids still go hungry in very well developed countries. Things are incrementally better than the 70s. I wasn’t even born then.Just because there is some way to automate sending an email to someone doesn’t mean that life is changed forever.

Using social media for st make the world better or even change it really.No jobs are going to become obsolete because people really don’t like change. Adoption of new tech is much too small to actually move he needle for people.Look at Uber and Lyft. There are still can drivers, because getting paid a living wage from those companies sucks. There are still portrait studios because sharing photos on Facebook isn’t permanent. People still want a photo hung on the wall. Paper companies are still in business because writing things only online sucks. Some times you still need a piece of paper to do things.Some people still use sundials. There are people who still have jobs making the oldest form of clock. No jobs are going away.

4,"In 1995, my favourite Elect Engg professor at IITK told our class, 'Cellphones are now being introduced in India. Who is going to use them? Is this technology even relevant to a society like ours?'We know what happened in the next 10-15 years.As an entrepreneur, I have learned the hard way that the most dangerous thing to say is: People will never do 'X'.

We become its proponent and wake up only when the game is over.I will end with a quote from a Yahoo engineer I was talking to in 2006 - 'Gmail has only 5 million users, we (Yahoo Mail) have 30 million. Older people will never switch to Gmail.'Note: It is not my case that you can’t have a point of view on the future of technology. But remember that it is a hypothesis.

7,"Nanotechnology, but in a really cool way.You remember the microbots in Big Hero 6, right? Well, unfortunately, those microbots are impossible, but there is a similar technology that’s being developed in real life.The idea is to build tiny replicators that can create more of themselves, like a sort of super bacteria that never stops replicating. Such a technology would be“…the first replicator assembles a copy in one thousand seconds, the two replicators then build two more in the next thousand seconds, the four build another four . . in less than two days, theyNanotechnology, but in a really cool way.You remember the microbots in Big Hero 6, right?

But they would have an abundance of material on Earth, especially of carbon, which would likely be the building blocks of such an assemblers. If you were carrying a jar of them and tripped and they spilled out, and they had no limit, they would quickly devour the entire earth with no way of stopping them.But here is where things get interesting: These tiny robots would have the ability to construct molecules from atoms, giving them the ability to produce amazing materials like graphene, cubes of apple, and even brain material.With advanced nanotechnology in the form of self-replicators, the entire world would experience a revolution. Think for a second about what wouldn’t change in the face of machines that can produceProduction jobs would cease. The price of every item ever created would be lowered massively. Supercomputers and experiments regarding brain material would become almost commonplace. Terraforming other planets would take years if not months.

8,"100 years is an ambitious timeframe. However, you can extrapolate what technology might evolve if you can look at what seemingly intractable problems we have today, or those we’ll eminently have. Then you have to bet we'll invent our way through them. It's a pattern we humans are known for.There's no way to do this with any credible precision. I.E. these are wild guesses.So here's my Nostradomous like list applying the logical pattern above:100 years is an ambitious timeframe.
