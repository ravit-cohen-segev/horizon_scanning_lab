Admittedly, information technology has made physical travel much less necessary, but some travel is a human need.Advancement is needed at all scales. At short range, existing public transport technology cannot serve everyone‚Äôs home, and it is exiguous to nonexistent in thinly populated regions. At long range, airline travel is good, but it interfaces poorly with travel at other scales.These are generalized problems, and they may have unexpected solutions, just as infoTravel seems to have fallen behind other technological advances.

The advantages I perceive are:The advance to cars as utility is somewhat analogous to universal health care, which, by comparison with health care and insurance by businesses, costs less than half as much, and results in better public health. Further to the analogy with health care, cars as a utility would be a large change of culture, especially for less advanced nations.",4 followers,Leon Brennan,24.9K,693,21.5M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-advanced-technology-do-you-want-by-2050

It could be due to ‚Äúalien error‚Äù, as opposed to ‚Äúhuman error‚Äù.  It could be that these spacecraft are considered expendable, just like the ballpoint pen in your pocket that is probably three months from being tossed into the trash due to fouling up by running out of ink.  Some of the creatures we think of as aliens could be biological robots or avatars‚Äîexpendable machinery like the ballpoint pen, and so not worth the effort and/or expense of putting a spacecraft around them that has supposedly safer more redundant equipment to keep it from crashing.Europeans came to America hundreds of years ago with the latest in weaponry and technology, and yet still managed to get killed by native Americans shooting arrows.

Now, one thing I will say is that our special forces guys do get ahold of some cool toys before they reach store shelves. Is it 50 years ahead of what's commercially available? No. Why? Because outside of stuff developed by DARPA, most of the really modern military stuff is civilian made stuff that has been tweaked, upgraded, and/or ruggedized for military use.The only place you can legitimately say that the military is largely ahead of civilians is traumatic wound care. Most modern lifesaving trauma care is pioneered by the military. How could that be, you ask? Well, when it comes to saving troops who are bleeding out from IED strikes, military doctors don't give a shit about approved treatments if the options are down to definitely-dead-grunt or snowball's-chance-in-hell-of-live grunt-if-I-try-this.
