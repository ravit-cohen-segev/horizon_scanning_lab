He’s determined and hard working - but I don’t see visionary thinking here.His biggest ideas - such as to put a million person city on Mars, or to replace all cars with “RoboTaxi’s” - seem “obvious” and simultaneously “unworkable”…but the effort involved in getting there has revolutionised the space industry and the car industry…neither will ever be the same again.But in terms of taking an existing concept like an electric car - or a self-driving taxi - or a giant rocketship - are not in anyway new. What Elon does is to take an existing kinda futuristic science-fiction idea and provide enough drive to make it into a reality.StarShip is pure 1960’s “Buck Rogers” - GM’s “EV-1” was surely the inspiration for Tesla. Satellite Internet is not new.The difference is that StarShip is GIGANTIC, crazy-cheap, incredibly versatile…and it’s right there - glinting against the Texas sky and looking like the cover of any number of pulp science fiction books.GM made the first really practical electric car - and then kinda dropped it. Tesla are selling a million of them a year already.We’ve had really crappy satellite internet for decades - but it’s stupidly slow and expensive. But Elon says “What if we launched forty THOUSAND satellites?” - and with scale and sheer engineering force of will - it’s happening.Electric cars are impractical because they need recharging and it takes 3 hours? Fine, let’s just build 12,000 recharging stations and push the tech until you can recharge in 15 minutes.The “DARPA Grand Challenge” showed that self-driving vehicles are possible…but not easy. WayMo’s self-driving software is kinda interesting - but it’s not going anywhere fast. So Elon jumps in and says: Let’s build the worlds largest AI supercomputer - design the world fastest AI chip and stuff a couple of them into every car alongside 8 cameras and a dozen ultrasound units and do that with 2 million cars to collect the data to feed the monster AI.None of this is exactly “NEW” - but the sheer scale and audacity of these projects is what make them breathtaking. The ability to make money WHILE doing something revolutionary means that his companies never have to say “I wish we had enough money to do X.”…money is almost never the limiting factor because Musk seems to see how to extract money to keep the company running with enough left over to fund “audacity”.So I’m left with the engineering talent of Brunell with the business skills of Ford…and the work ethic of…well, I can’t think of anyone that *driven* before.It’ll be interesting to see how history sees the man.","19,202 followers",Jim Cantrell,1.1K,0,0,2020,https://www.quora.com/Is-it-possible-to-sell-an-ad-tech-company-just-for-the-technology-and-before-youve-got-a-mass-of-clients-to-a-company-like-APN-Rubicon-etc

Elon is very intelligent, has a nearly inexhaustible energy, and possess an incredible appetite for making progress.  He is really a Rogue because he does it outside of the normal channels of thinking and outside of the normal channels of doing.  He, like many of us who have joined him at various parts of his adventures, simply realized at a point in our lives that radical transformation cannot happen within the system but must happen from outside the system.  Some of us even believe that the larger economic system and society actually hinders progress and you have to be on the outside of it to truly change things for the better.Those of us who helped Elon start SpaceX had all self-ejected from Corporate America at one point or another because of its conformity in thinking and limitations on doing.  Early SpaceX was a merry band of brothers who were refugees from the oppressive 'group think' of Corporate America - and especially the aerospace industry.  To us, it was an archaic economic system frighteningly similar to the Soviet command and control economic system that the Cold War sought to defeat.  This kind of environment was not conducive to our sense of what needed to be accomplished to move humanity forward or even to doing things that resulted in a satisfied sense of accomplishment.  Those we left behind ""in the system"" referred to us derisively as ""Rogue Engineers"".  We came to wear those words, meant to insult us, as a badge of honor.  Elon is the biggest and best known member of this group and, as far as I can tell, was born outside of it.  He would lead the ""group"" but by definition we have no leaders and cannot be led.In many ways this is the story of North America and the United States as a whole.  Our ancestors who settled this country, like Elon, left comfortable existences or escaped tragedy and came here with little idea of what they were going to do, how they were going to survive, or where they would end up.   They were inherent risk takers and they built the civilization that eventually went to the Moon and beyond.  Our early settlers, like Elon,  knew that this was the place where opportunity existed and the best of all possible places to make dreams a reality.   They were Rogues in the truest sense of the term and we are proud followers of this tradition.",18 followers,Asim Qureshi,11.6K,996,156M,2015,https://www.quora.com/Is-Elon-Musk-a-visionary-or-a-businessman

[ https://qr.ae/TSJJTM ]I won’t go over everything, but in that answer, I go over the history of Amazon as a dot-com.It concludes that Bezos was literally like any other dot com during that time. He just wanted to sell books. That was his goal. To sell books. To be a bookstore, but online. As Amazon. This is before somebody told Jeff that it would be better to have third-party sellers and simply hold their stuff in a warehouse that fulfills two-day shipping for their customers.At the trough of the dot-com bubble bursting, over a hundred companies lost more than $2 trillion dollars in market cap. Amazon had lost over 90% of its value during this time.You want to know what saved Amazon and Bezos? Their CFO, Warren Jenson, who sold $670 million in convertible bonds to European investors in early February of 2000.Want to know when the dot-com bubble burst?Had that deal gone through a month or two after, Amazon wouldn’t exist today. That $670 million gave them the funding they needed to survive.And then do you know what made Amazon what it is today?The CEO of Amazon Web Services, Andy Jassy. During 2003, he led the groundwork to create the infrastructure for the cloud and for the developers interested.By 2006, under its re-launch, they stated AWS “helps free developers from worrying about where they are going to store data, whether it will be safe and secure, if it will be available when they need it, the costs associated with server maintenance, or whether they have enough storage available. Amazon S3 enables developers to focus on innovating with data, rather than figuring out how to store it.”AWS is what Amazon grew on all those years. Even while their shipping components still bleed today, AWS continues to grow. They were the first players in the cloud computing/data analytics realm. They had an edge. They subsidized this dream of selling stuff online with Web Services.But that visionary wasn’t Jeff Bezos. It was Andy Jessy.If you look at the recent annual report, you’ll see another interesting point that Amazon has noted:Again, Jeff has it wrong (if that is Jeff). Third-party sellers aren’t kicking their first party butt. Third-party sellers are the ones that have made their business.That’s what Amazon does. That’s what Amazon has been doing. They are providing the tools to let others succeed. They are providing the infrastructure to give the power to others.Jeff failed trying to sell books, like every other dot-com failed trying to do one specific thing, but transposed onto the internet.The smart people surrounding him led him to the understanding that the way up is to provide the resources and tools to others horizontally. Somewhere down the line someone navigated toward leverage instead of massive liability—and probable bankruptcy.On the other hand, Elon is a visionary from the start. But he’s also a cross of a visionary and a clever capitalist.He jumped into Stanford’s Ph.D. program for two days until he dropped out.He began his first company, Zip2, where he was one of the first people to provide businesses an online presence. Ring any bells to what Jessy was doing post 2003?This company sold to Compaq in 1999 for $305 million. It made Elon $22 million.His next big project was creating an internet bank that eased transactions between people. He founded X.com. At the time, Confinity had released PayPal, which was competing with them. eBay had released Billpoint, also trying to dominate that market.These three fought for presence on eBay for a while.Somewhere down the line, Elon got smart. He realized that the combined liquidity of Confinity and X.com could stand a chance against eBay. Whereas alone, Billpoint would probably pull ahead and the other two would slowly lose market cap into their eventual ...",152 followers,Tom Alexander,11.5K,160,3.5M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Is-Elon-Musk-a-visionary-or-a-businessman

In every process node, we were at least a generation or two behind Maxim. Prasad, who was involved in Maxim’s process development knew we were behind, said, “It’s the best we can do with the resources I am given.”“We’re gonna lose with the strategy we have right now,” I said to Prasad. “We can’t compete (with Maxim). Do you think ‘Bob’ (the CEO) knows?”“Yes, but you know Bob,” Prasad said to me.You have to be realistic about what you can do, and what you can’t do.I had been at Micrel for about two weeks, and I was getting a pretty good idea of where the problems were. On paper, the product strategy and market focus made sense.But, the success of the strategy would hinge on Micrel’s ability to compete head to head against companies that had better technology and better engineers to design products. I could see clearly there was no chance for us to win with this strategy.When I asked the team why they thought we would win, the answer was, “We’re Micrel.”Let me give you an example. One of the products that was in the early stages of development when I joined Micrel was a 10Gbps Transimpedance Amplifier (TIA). This product is used to amplify the signal received from a photodiode from a fiber optic cable.The design of these types of products is fairly straightforward, and the differentiator is all about the process technology. And our process technology was inferior. In other words, we had no chance.I was meeting with Bob and I explained that I felt we should cancel the product development because I felt the product wasn’t going to sell. I compared our specs to the specs of the Maxim part.Maxim’s part was clearly superior to our part. Bob said, “Ours is pretty good for a first effort, isn’t it?”Bob couldn’t accept reality. That’s where the “we’re Micrel” attitude was coming from.You have to do what you’re good at doing even if it isn’t sexy.I would have to scrap the strategy of going head to head against Maxim. Fortunately, there was one area of business where Micrel had an unfocused competitor, and they had at least a level playing field.This area was the dull and boring area of high speed logic gates and level shifters. There was only one competitor (On Semiconductor), the market was large, the margins were good, and it was something the team could actually execute on.The challenge wasn’t getting the team to execute the plan. The challenge was explaining to Bob that we were going to exit the other area we were focused on.I set up a meeting with Bob and our CFO. I started walking Bob through our strengths and weaknesses.I explained the first weakness to Bob. The reply from Bob was, “Now you’ve done it.I explained the second weakness to Bob. The reply from Bob was, “Now you’ve done it.”I explained the third weakness to Bob. The replay from Bob was, “Now you’ve done it.”Bob then stood up, straightened his tie and said, “I never want to have another meeting like this again.” Then he left the meeting.You can have all the ideas you want, but you have to be able to execute them.I never did have another meeting like that with Bob. Instead, I just did what I thought was right. The strategy, as I said, was downright dull and boring.However, the results were not dull and boring. In three years, the division was transformed from Micrel’s biggest money loser to the most profitable division of the company.And my reward for this great work? Well, Bob fired me.

It’s asymmetrical AND balanced. The elements are felicitous together but not expected.Good ideas are everywhere. But if you’re too literal and are looking for a sign with an arrow (“Impeccable idea found here!”) you won’t be open to adapting a good idea to (maybe) improve it and make it yours.",211 followers,Aman Goel,548,523,37.1M,2022,https://www.quora.com/Is-Elon-Musk-a-visionary-or-a-businessman
