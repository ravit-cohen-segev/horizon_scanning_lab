2,"This is actually a tough one because schools in Nigeria are re ranked generally, not based on programs or courses. However, University of Lagos (Unilag), Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU) and Covenant University (CU) are good bets but for more specialised trainings, NIIT,  HIIT and New Horizon are well recognised.

4,"Just this week, my friend wanted to buy a particular brand of fan and I went down with him to cash and carry as I wanted to check the price of a particular TV. We got there and he didn't find the brand he was looking for. The sales rep attending to us rather than convince us to buy any of the other brands they stock, told my friend she would give him another person's number who sold the same product and she was sure he would sell it for less and she goes on to tell us to tell him she referred us.

We got there and he didn't find the brand he was looking for. The sales rep attending to us rather than convince us to buy any of the other brands they stock, told my friend she would give him another person's number who sold the same product and she was sure he would sell it for less and she goes on to tell us to tell him she referred us. We got back to the car having spent barely five minutes in the store and the security guard asked if we found what we came for and while we didn't answer him, he went on, unasked to tell us he knew a guy who could sell to us for less than cash and carry would. I just shook my head. Either cash and carry pays poorly (not judging here) or some ex staff has penetrated their existing structure and is fleecing them of sales or some of their staff are just crooked or maybe it's a Nigerian thing to be ""sharp"".Some one else I know who runs a bar discovers his staff sell their own drinks (almost all bar owners face this challenge till they curb it) on his premises, using his fridges and power. Everyone literally was in on the racket.Now these are internal issues. There are infrastructure issues. No power, no water. There's government interferences. Taxes from local government, LASAA, Lawma etc there's government policies that though not directly end up affecting you.The point is it's hard building any kind of business in Nigeria. But what makes building tech businesses harder is down to two things. Model and strategy. Before I delve into both, let me say something about the tech startup phase in this country.We are experiencing a startup porn. Everyone who doesn't get a job or who knows how to write a code of two suddenly has become a tech entrepreneur. Two things are driving this behavior.A. Tech is the future and already has changed the world. Some of the biggest companies in the world today are tech companies. Hello Google, Facebook, Apple.B. There's a lot of venture funds waiting for the right tech start up.The latter reason is the cause of distortion.The biggest question your tech start up needs to answer is how will you make money. This isn't let's build, they will come. How will you make money? We will monetize the site traffic isn't acceptable. You are not sure you will get the traffic in the first place.Second consideration is when will you make money(not return a profit but generate revenue). The farther into the future your start up will make money, the more money you will need to keep it running and the harder it will be to get funding for it(not always true). The slower your funding plan, the slower your growth rate. The slower your growth rate, the nearer the death time.Third consideration is how easy is it to replicate what you are doing and how do you hedge against competition or new entrants in the same space.Fourth consideration is what type of team do you have building your startup.Fifth consideration which is a bit of an off shoot of the fourth is what culture drives your start up. Are you guys the go home at 6pm types or keep working till it gets solved types. Are you the oh....only if Atiku was president....then our startup would be great types or you are....Buhari is president...that's done....let's get work done types.But what I'd tell you having been doing business for nearly two decades in this country and loving it for the most part (some days are really horrible) is your startup might fail and the next one you start too might fail. Salaries might become a headache. You will lose money and possibly credibility, your spouse, girlfriend/boyfriend, side chick or side guy (if you can afford it) may doubt you. Even you will doubt yourself at some point.Two things you need to constantly remember.1. The next one might be the one that will make you ""hammer"".2. The $1 million is not the thrill, it's the journey to the $1 million or $1 billion or whatever it is you are looking for, that is the thrill. The headaches, the worries, the Nos, site crashing, back up corrupt, those are the fun part of the journey, don't live through them in a hurry, they make the tales when you arrive at your destination more interesting.May the force be with you.

It’s a place of extreme acceptance. I have never been anywhere in the world quite like India in this regard. People are just simply accepted. There is a difference between acceptance and tolerance. Most places I have been in the world, people are tolerant of tourist, religions, differences and color of your skin. India is accepting. It is truly the most endearing thing about this country in my eyes.Being a citizen of the USA, I thought that “America” was a melting pot. It’s more like a melting dish compared to India. India is massively diverse and yet live in harmony with each other in a way I haven’t been able to find in many places in the world. The days of the caste system are over and the people of India have once again assimilated to their surroundings.The Indian people have assimilated for centuries of occupations that has helped to create this acceptance. From the Muslim invaders to the British most recently, this country has not lost her identity over thousands of years, yet assimilates parts of the occupiers seamlessly. This is admirable and says a lot about the Indian people.So Lets get to the things/ places I like most about India in no particular order!2.The people!3. Dharamshala/ Mcleod Ganj.4. The Festivals.5.

Prices are affordable and reasonable, considering the distance of the nearest town from the area.But what sold me most about Sidemen is its accommodation. There isn’t a better deal on the planet than at Sidemen.Take close look at this property, and while you’re at it, take a guess of the price?This property is only US$25, Embang Homestay backed by excellent reviews.If you think I am cherry picking one property, then I have good news for you. Sidemen has some of the best deals in the island. For a good reason, high percentage of the property has incredibly high review scores.There are accommodation above the $50 price range that would be considered luxury by Sidemen standard.I was lucky enough to stay atA property like Samanvaya in Ubud or Canggu would set you back at least $200–300/night.Another popular place is Cepik Villa ($50–$70/night). The pictures speaks for itself:Here is another picture from TripAdvisor overlooking the pool of Samanvaya. The picture does not do justice to capture the true vibe of Sidemen. It’s simply breathtaking.But don’t underestimate budget accommodation in Sidemen, which still provides some of high-end hospitality and experience.Here are some more picture of Sidemen’s surrounding.I would recommend to spend 2 or 3 nights in Sidemen.

(Or the Angelina Jolie temple from Lara Croft: Tomb Raider)The night market, street food (including the fried ice cream!) and the shopping streets are great -you get great stuff at reasonable prices if you know how to bargain. Even the pubs are good and the local beer called Angkor is cheap.Try to squeeze in a cultural show one evening - you won’t regret it:A lake ride in Cambodia’s biggest lake -the Tonle Sap Lake is worth it.. You will visit amazing floating villages where people live on water and commute with boats! Quite a wonder for people (like me) who have never seen (or imagined!) such a thing before.The floating villages..Also note that Cambodia runs on US Dollars even if they have their own local currency. You will get both local money and US Dollars in ATM's.

Beach, booze, music, the good life.Kampong Cham - Small town Cambodia. Sleepy, peaceful.Chambok and surroundings - Tropical forests, wilderness, natural beauty.Phnom Penh - the dignified capital, with all the frills of a dignified capital. Plenty of politics in the air.Its a great country to explore and the people are incredibly honest and simple. It is a country that is trying to get back on its feet after long periods of political turmoil and genocide.
