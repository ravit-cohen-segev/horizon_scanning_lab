Grinding weld lines and putting in new systems has been far more cost effective than designing a new tank from scratch.The armor is better today than ever before. The gun system and optics are better than ever before. The optics actually meet the power of the gun, finally. 20+ years ago, they could identify with great accuracy, vehicles out to at best, 2,000 meters in ideal conditions. But the gun could fire nearly twice that, probably more on some targets and still get a kill. Today, the optics can see clearly out to those ranges in all weather.Even for the past 40 years, no Abrams has to my knowledge, been destroyed by an enemy tank. Some have been damaged, even knocked out, but the crew survived. The only instance I recall of an Abrams being destroyed, was when a tank ran over a triple stack of anti-tank mines. That is basically 18 pounds times 3 of plastic explosives!Until an actual peer tank comes along that can threaten the M1, it probably won't be replaced, it's just that good. Of course training and tactics are a very large part of its success. And you can't include the Abrams lost by saudi in yemen, it's not the same tank, and the quality of the fighters and tactics, is nowhere near the same.","4,347 followers",Shaun Mootoo,825,13K,26.4M,2022,https://www.quora.com/Why-hasnt-the-US-replaced-the-M1-Abrams-Is-there-no-new-armour-technology-that-is-better

The now famous Depleted Uranium elements of the M1’s armor scheme were brand new, first introduced in 1988, and rapidly added to the tanks being redeployed from Germany to Saudi Arabia in 1990 in one of the first major armor improvements. Those armor kits that were largely add ons for the M1A1 were built into the base armor scheme of the mid-90s new M1A2.The M1A2 SEPv3 (aka M1A2C) Abrams tanks that are the front line combat vehicles today, in terms of armor, have already gone through at least 3 generations worth of improvements and upgrades since the original. Estimates of it’s armor protection are around 3 times better for todays Abrams vs those original 1980s vintage M1s…This is of course not counting the kits that allow for the bolt on of additional Explosive Reaction Armor (ERA) blocks on top of the main armor scheme, and/or “Slat” or “Cage” armor used to help detonate RPGs and ATGMs before they even come in contact with the armor.The newest M1s are also being fitted with Israeli designed Trophy hard kill defenses to actively engage and shoot down incoming hostile rockets and missiles at a distance…The M1A2 SEP variants have been equipped with third generation depleted uranium armor combined with a graphite coating. The M1A2C also features increased physical line-of-sight turret armor.Just because it’s shaped in largely the same way with more or less same layout and drive train, so many features have likewise gone through lots of upgrades over the years. Basically every single bit of electronics (from radios, to gun sights, to the sensors and computers that take all sorts of atmospheric measurements to ensure 1 hit kills), even the main ammo is on the -A4 upgrades from the original (meaning 5th gen)Todays Abrams are NOT the same 1980s XM1s, heck they’re vastly upgraded virtually everything inside compared to the 1990s M1A1s, that only the outside shape is pretty much the same, inside they’re as completely upgraded to a whole new tank as the M60 was over the M48 practically.It’s just all wrapped up in the same shaped package that thus keeps the same base M1 Abrams designation, while virtually every part of that package (including the armor it’s shaped in) has undergone multiple upgrades over its decades of service…",UNKNOWN,M.

Russia claims the new T-14 Armata tank is the most powerful in the world. But we now have a much better understanding of Russian weapons propaganda. And it is likely Russia has less than 20 T-14 tanks. So it is not a significant threat to the Abrams tank. And Russia has not put any of these new tanks into combat in Ukraine.

The T-80 is also based on the T-64, just with more Gucci stuff than the T-72. So you could say that the Russians have been using the same base tank for more than 50 years.When you say new ‘armor’ technology that is essentially what the M1 has done with each upgrade. Whether it is the armor, the power pack, the gun, the fire control…nothing on the M1A2SEPv4 is original.While the M1 famously had Chobham armor, subsequent upgrades use additional depleted uranium armor, utilizing different thicknesses (see HA variants), classified ceramics, NERA configurations, graphite coatings and many more.The M1 originally had a 105mm rifled-gun that was tried and proven by the British and on the M60 tank. That gave fairly quickly to the 120mm smoothbore-gun. The original fire control system operating that main gun also gave way to complete replacements with more modern systems on no less than half-a-dozen occasions over the course of the M1’s life.When it comes to the power pack of the M1, the original engine still powers the tank…but again really only in name. The engine has continually been improved. Same goes for the APU and transmission. There have been multiple proposals over the last 30 years or more to replace the engine with diesels but it still hasn't happened and it hasn't really mattered.That isn't even really scratching the surface of all the upgrades over the years.","33,159 followers",Susanna Viljanen,1.2K,10.7K,164.9M,2022,https://www.quora.com/Why-hasnt-the-US-replaced-the-M1-Abrams-Is-there-no-new-armour-technology-that-is-better

And now apparently the M1A2 SEPV3, which has even more upgrades to its sensor and countermeasures suite. The M1 originally went into limited production in 1979, so it’s definitely at the 40 year mark now. However, unlike the M60, there appears to still be plenty of growth potential in the M1 platform. It’s a roomy hull that has good roadkeepiing capabilities and plenty of space for new warfighting gear or armor enhancements. There’s just no reason to design a new tank from scratch when the current one meets all current requirements and there’s no obvious improvement that can’t be made within the confines of the current hull. About the only issue the M1 has is range, and there’s nothing inherent in the hull that would keep the M1 from being issued a more efficient modern 1500hp-class tank diesel. It just hasn’t been a priority because the short range of the M1 hasn’t been an issue in combat while the turbine’s low weight and high torque are both benefits of the turbine.",658 followers,Tom Fessenden,1K,2.4K,6.1M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Why-hasnt-the-US-replaced-the-M1-Abrams-Is-there-no-new-armour-technology-that-is-better

But the core network is just not ready. It needs to be replaced.”De Leon likens today’s internet architecture to a two-lane highway built for vehicles with 50cc engines. But when 5G comes along, it will need three- or four-lane highways with turbo engines.“It’s not right. You need to be able to rearchitect how the internet could and should be used for the future.”The grandfather of the internet was right all alongDe Leon and his team have gone back to the foundation of the internet and interviewed Louis Pouzin, who came up with the idea of the datagram, one of the first ideas around how you could move packets of data around a network.“We know the father of the internet is Vint Cerf for TCP/IP, but ask Vint about who was there at the time running the groups – it was Louis. He gives great insights into whole lots of alternatives that could be used.“What we’ve done over the last number of years is we’ve gone and implemented them and tested them against TCP/IP and … there are some good alternatives here that could and will be used in the future.”Surely this would be expensive? De Leon thinks not: “When you look at how cloud data centres are put together today with virtual machines, there is now much easier ways to seamlessly replace the current internet architecture with alternatives”.“We were at the SDN World Congress in October and we showed demonstrations of how seamless it is … to move over from the current internet to what we are proposing, which is a much better-architected alternative.”De Leon indicates that the current limitations of the internet can be seen when homes and office networks experience congestion control when users try to access various apps or games.“You still don’t get connectivity to the apps that you want,” De Leon said.“On our alternative, you get a network for your application – a dedicated connectivity from your application all the way to the data centre or the peer application that you are talking with, guaranteed QRS, what we call a guaranteed network slice.”What De Leon is proposing sounds wonderful but how soon will it become a reality?“We are just applying TRL 6, which means we are proving the concept. The top of the range is TRL 9. This is in the next two to three years, to show how you can integrate this into products on site and for delivery.”If De Leon and his colleagues are correct, then network operators and equipment makers need to pay attention, in case they put a massive data cart before the horse, when what we really need is V8 engines on a four-lane motorway.Will Alternet replace present day internet?The internet has changed its character dramatically several times over its short life. It started in the late 1960s as a military project, morphed into an academic network in the 1980s and was transformed into a vehicle for commerce in the 1990s, before being invaded by social media in the 2000s. Now it’s on the verge of a change that puts all the others in the shade.An alternative way of organising the internet is being built as we speak: an internet where no one is in control, where the government can’t find you or shut you down, where big tech companies aren’t able to learn everything about you. A decentralised net that is both private and impossible to censor.This revolution is being plotted in snazzy offices just off Fulham High Street in south-west London — not what I was expecting, since you associate hackers with hoodies, basements and graffiti. But the Ethereum project isn’t a typical hackers’ collective: it received around $12 million of crowd-funded support when it was founded a couple of years ago, by a 20-year-old Russian-Canadian programming wizard called Vitalik Buterin. That’s been enough to hire 40 of the smartest geeks you’ll ever meet, and house them in comfort in Amsterdam, Berlin and London.‘Welcome to Web 3.0,’ says Vinay Gupta, a hacker-cum-poverty-activist who’s part of the Ethereum team, as I arrive. Web 1.0 was all static websites. Web 2.0 was interactive social media platforms like Facebook. This third iteration is about encrypted peer-to-peer networks. It sounds dry, but Ethereum — which is launching part of its software this spring — has London’s tech crowd purring. Last year it won the World Technology Award for IT software. IBM has already used it to build a washing machine that orders its own soap.But these people aren’t in it for the money. Ethereum is an open-source project which is available to everyone, and its employees will slink off when the project is complete. They’re doing it because they want to transform the internet — and, by extension, society.In practical terms Ethereum does two things. First, it’s what Vinay calls ‘deep infrastructure’. It’s building a new web out of the spare power and hard-drive space of millions of connected computers that its owners put on the network. What they say of the brain is true of your computer — you only ever use a small amount of it. Ethereum links all that spare power and space and allowsSecond, it allows people to create immutable, public transaction records. (Bear with me on this: it’s very important.) The problem with digital records is that they can be copied and so are not really owned by anyone. Borrowing the idea from the digital currency bitcoin, Ethereum uses something called a ‘block chain’ to record information on a public database in a chronological way that prevents copying, tampering, fraud or deletion. It’s a new anonymous, decentralised, uncensored internet, and a new way of controlling and storing information. This is why the tech crowd are excited.Ethereum is one of many initiatives trying to change the way the internet works, making it easier to prevent censorship, monitoring or control (another is called MaidSafe, based in Scotland, which works to similar principles). Many people have been stirred by Edward Snowden’s whistleblowing or by growing unease about the creeping power of Google and Facebook.When you open a browser and surf the web it feels seamless, but there are invisible rules and systems in the background: domain name servers, company servers, routing protocols, security protocols. This is the stuff that keeps the internet going: rules that route your request for traffic, servers that host that web page you’re after, systems that certify for your computer that the site you’re trying to access isn’t bogus.","17,177 followers",Ryan Carlyle,1.5K,1.5K,15.5M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Why-hasnt-the-US-replaced-the-M1-Abrams-Is-there-no-new-armour-technology-that-is-better
