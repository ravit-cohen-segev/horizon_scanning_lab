I’m sure the next transgression will be worse, including players if need be.Players will be read the riot act come spring training. I seriously doubt anyone will try this again very soon.Also, sign stealing takes several people, and loose lips sink ships.

I seriously doubt anyone will try this again very soon.Also, sign stealing takes several people, and loose lips sink ships. Perhaps MLB will up the ante than not only will cheaters be made ineligible for a year on first transgression, but any player who knows about it and doesn’t report it will also be made ineligible (along the lines of Rule 24D regarding gambling).The point is that if you make the punishment harsh enough, it will deter the cheating.Q: How can professional sport teams avoid cheating when there’s access to many advanced technology?","5,990 followers",Jens Böttiger,566,2.6K,17.6M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Why-should-advanced-technology-not-be-allowed-in-professional-sports
1,"The Ashes.It’s the longest held international sporting competition in the world, beating the Olympic games by almost two decades.Australia and England first met in 1877 to play Test Match cricket (the five day form of the game) and England won, which isn’t surprising because Australia wasn’t really a country yet and had a population roughly the size of a modern day cricket audience.But in 1882 the Australian team toured England and defeated them in a close fought match, much to the horror of the large crowd. This prompted a mock obiturary to appear in an English newspaper lamenting the death oThe Ashes.It’s the longest held international sporting competition in the world, beating the Olympic games by almost two decades.Australia and England first met in 1877 to play Test Match cricket (the five day form of the game) and England won, which isn’t surprising because Australia wasn’t really a country yet and had a population roughly the size of a modern day cricket audience.But in 1882 the Australian team toured England and defeated them in a close fought match, much to the horror of the large crowd. This prompted a mock obiturary to appear in an English newspaper lamenting the death of English cricket and claiming the body would be cremated and taken to Australia.The competition then became known as the Ashes and a few years later some cricket bails were burnt and the remains put in a small urn to form the trophy.Every two years the two nations meet and compete in a 5 or 6 test series to see who has the right to hold the Ashes.At the time of writing, the teams have met 70 times and Australia leads with 33 victories to 32. Australia currently hold the Ashes and defend them in England in 2019.It’s not exaggeration to say that Australian sports fans care more about the Ashes than any other sporting trophy. For Cricket fans especially it’s the only thing that matters. Australians can win or lose 50 over or T20 world cups and most of the country don’t even notice if the competition occurs during the football season. But the Ashes isn’t just a matter of life and death, it’s more important.","68,777 followers",Kanthaswamy Balasubramaniam,898,17.3K,413.3M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Why-should-advanced-technology-not-be-allowed-in-professional-sports
2,"You don’t advance technology as a monolith. Germany is a leader in material science and mechanical engineering.Germany is sub-par in software engineering and in its physical communication infrastructure. This is in part due to persistent cultural wariness of surveillance technologies like social media. People aren’t keen to fund the infrastructure to make mass surveillance easier, and politicians don’t want to be seen as pushing for the capability.Germany also has the capability to advance nuclear technology, but doesn’t due to mass scientific illiteracy among the voting population that falselYou don’t advance technology as a monolith.

Germany is not the most technologically advanced country. It could be pretty close, but there are major elements of society who dedicate themselves to making sure that Germany uses inferior technology that kills more people, damages the environment more, costs more money, and will cause the total collapse of Earth’s biosphere due to a runaway greenhouse effect. Mostly in the Green Party. Because radiation from nuclear accidents is apparently scarier than way more people dying of regular pollution constantly and the total annihilation of all life on Earth as the oceans boil away.","5,360 followers",Valerio Cietto,677,2.4K,9.1M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Why-should-advanced-technology-not-be-allowed-in-professional-sports
3,"Probably not. A person who has been blind their whole life does not know how to see.My husband has been blind for over 50 years. He says that if he were to suddenly regain his sight, there would be too much to process. It would overwhelm his brain.He is perfectly happy with blindness.

5,"You mean, would I accept having to relearn how to do everything, using a sense that my brain has never been trained to parse, after the visual cortex has been thoroughly repurposed, which would mean that I wouldn’t get the full “benefit” of sight? In a process that would take years, during which I would be essentially completely helpless?I’d rather eat bees.","358,853 followers",Sean Kernan,4.6K,5.6K,726.4M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Why-should-advanced-technology-not-be-allowed-in-professional-sports
6,"Financial literacy is as relevant as your need to earn and provide for yourself.Now let me say, for example, a person has an amazing job and earns well.

In that case, he'll either have to rely on internet and try and search for basic terminology too, while there is no guarantee if correct answers are available or rely and trust on someone else.

8,"OK. Let’s pause, and think about it. What is the problem with existing supply chains, and how might it be solved?It’s important to remember that blockchain is just a distributed ledger technology, it is not magical.Blockchain cannot automagically fix broken processes. Blockchain doesn’t have sentience or omniscience, so it cannot automagically tell that someone is entering goods onto the chain that are forgeries… and of course once that record is on the chain, only a fool would blindly trust it as “truth” without having some way of assuring that the “genuine Ford manufactured brake lining” isnOK.
