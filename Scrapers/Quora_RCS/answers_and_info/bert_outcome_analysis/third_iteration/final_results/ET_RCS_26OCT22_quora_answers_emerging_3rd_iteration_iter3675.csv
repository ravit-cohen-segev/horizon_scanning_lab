I think that is code for “wizard”, a manipulator of magic.At the same time, when I gently suggest that they may want to take advantage of the myriad training tools we have available, they object: “Oh no, I’m not a computer person!”So these are highly accomplished, highly educated people, some at the top of their careers…who eschew readily available technology training because they think…you know, I don’t know what their thinking is.If the cream of the intellectual crop, i.e. those in academia, harbor fears against technology, how much more so can we expect that from the rest of society?","3,804 followers",Marius Stanlaire,3K,194,18M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Have-we-reached-the-point-with-the-combination-of-anti-science-sentiment-with-smart-phones-that-Any-sufficiently-advanced-technology-is-indistinguishable-from-magic

But in the US, nobody in the plutocrat class wants to spend the tax money to fund decent libraries.Our ‘anti-science sentiment’ has a lot to do with our lack of desire to have a world-class education system befitting a country that is a center of the Empire.Maybe I’m glossing over the problems of the emerging Asian Tiger nations, but a kid growing up in South Korea won’t necessarily look at a Cell Phone as ‘magic’. There will be an understanding that somebody developed it or got a job supporting it, and if a kid studies hard enough, he or she can also create ‘magic’. An American kid, not so much—they’ll have to bone up on math and science in a way that their peers will deride as being a nerd.

5,"The “fear” is mostly irrational, but there is a rational explanation of this irrationality.Think about this scene:Wolfgang was a hunter in a hunter-gatherer society thousands of years ago who lived in a cave halfway to the top of a mountain overlooking forests and wetland. Wolfgang and his fellow hunters chased a deer they engaged at the perimeter of their territory, the deer dashed off downhill, leading Wolfgang and his fellow cavemen to an area that they haven’t been to before.Getting further and further into unknown territory, Wolfgang started to worry, a fear developed in his mind, he didnThe “fear” is mostly irrational, but there is a rational explanation of this irrationality.Think about this scene:Wolfgang was a hunter in a hunter-gatherer society thousands of years ago who lived in a cave halfway to the top of a mountain overlooking forests and wetland. Wolfgang and his fellow hunters chased a deer they engaged at the perimeter of their territory, the deer dashed off downhill, leading Wolfgang and his fellow cavemen to an area that they haven’t been to before.Getting further and further into unknown territory, Wolfgang started to worry, a fear developed in his mind, he didn’t know why, but he felt more and more anxious, while his fellow hunters focused on chasing the deer, he started to warn his fellow that “we’ve never been here, and we really don’t know if there are dangers around here, maybe the reward (the deer) does not worth the risk.”Just at that moment, a lion hopped right on top of the deer and bit its neck with a force that cracked the bone of the deer — the hunters heard the crack louder than it actually was. All the hunters held their breath although they were really trying to catch their breath, and the swear “You, Wolfgang, slowed us down to catch this deer” became the quiet but most sincere appreciation “Thank YOU! Wolfgang saved us by slowing us down from that deer.”It sure was an imaginary scenario, but nevertheless, one that is often used by evolutionist to explain our tendency of being overly sensitive to unknowns — in many cases, those who are more cautious of the unknown have a higher chance of survival than those who are too “fearless” of anything.Natural selection means there was a pay off to explore the new territory slowly and carefully. As the territory growing bigger and bigger, there was actually a diminishing “reward” to explore the unknown — existing territory would satisfy lots of the needs of the majority of the group.As a species evolved through that phase of evolution, we still have those traits inside us. We are suspicious of things we don’t know — and for “most” people, advanced technology is one of those areas — most of the advanced technologies are beyond most people’s understanding. It is quite understandable for people to be fearful of things they don’t fully understand. It is true (even for many very smart people in this field) that the development in advanced technology is faster than our ability to learn them all. So, everyone experiences an increasing unknown amount of newer technology.Adding on top of that, some of the players, namely many governments, from Russia to the Nazis, to China to the US have used their advanced technology to do some pretty damning things — often using their own citizens as subjects. This added layer of “known” sins of those who hold advanced technologies “confirmed” and extended that fear many people hold against advanced technology.That been said, fearing anything unknownSo, yeah, most of the fear is irrational, but there sure is a rational reason for the irrationality.How do we get out of such fear?I know some of the journalists rely on this type of interaction to make a living, but I’m not sure the paycheck they received justifies the confusion and irrational fear they extended by spreading this kind of rhetoric.","358,844 followers",Sean Kernan,2.7K,5.6K,726.3M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Have-we-reached-the-point-with-the-combination-of-anti-science-sentiment-with-smart-phones-that-Any-sufficiently-advanced-technology-is-indistinguishable-from-magic

7,"The technology I fear the most is bioengineering. It is possible to create novel life forms in the lab by creating novel DNA. It is also possible, and in fact a common practice, to modify organisms by splicing in new genes. In the 1950s there were countless low-budget movies with cheesy special effects where giant ants, tarantulas or other critters were spawned by the effects of nuclear radiation or the efforts of mad scientists and ran around eating, crushing or incinerating people.

It is not the big critters I worry about, it is bacteria and viruses. Scientists experimenting with pathogens might inadvertently give them the ability to sidestep the body’s natural defenses, or to become more infectious. I have little confidence that adequate safeguards are in place, after debacles in recent years in US labs which were supposed to have every possible safeguard. Then take it a step further and imagine someone intentionally enhancing the destructive capability of pathogens perhaps to demand ransom, or as a doomsday plan when their regime faces total destruction in a conventional or nuclear war, or because they think it will selectively kill their blood enemies due to some small genetic difference, or because they and their loyal subjects will be protected by a vaccine.",0 followers,Dilip Hegde,7.1K,159,1.5M,2018,https://www.quora.com/Have-we-reached-the-point-with-the-combination-of-anti-science-sentiment-with-smart-phones-that-Any-sufficiently-advanced-technology-is-indistinguishable-from-magic

You asked about how to know when our subconscious self is afraid.  In this case the signs are subtle, and they often don't look like fear at all.  For me, subconscious fear looks like stagnation or nepenthe.As I have gotten older, psyche & I have become more aligned in our goals, which is to say I am less resistant to her pacing, less dismissive of her fears. When I sense that psyche is trying to grab the wheel, I park the car and listen. I use meditation, or Eugene Gendlin's Focusing work, or sometimes just humor or a nap.  If fear is pushing some part of me to self-sabotage,  what matters to me now is that I find that scared kid part and provide a little comfort.I have developed a pretty severe case of self-compassion.  This means less walking on broken glass, less doors recklessly opened or recklessly ignored. It means I don't always accomplish what I might if I pushed like I once did. In return, from time to time, the scared part of me can point out that the guy in the clown mask is also afraid, and in the moment, it can suggest how to get him to hand over the knife.","135,501 followers",Hector Quintanilla,2K,1.2K,88.5M,2015,https://www.quora.com/Why-is-there-this-subconscious-fear-of-advancing-technology-amongst-certain-people

Their off-putting fuzzy legs creep up and down one or two at a time, like when I menacingly tap my fingers on the table, except even worse because they make no damn noise. What other animal moves like that!? I never know in what direction its heading, why its going somewhere, if it’s even looking at me. They can have four to twelve, beady, blinking eyes. They should be able to see well, but somehow they don’t. I can’t tell if having poor vision makes them more or less frightening.Not only is their body movement absolutely terrifying, but their tactics are unfamiliar to me in every way. They can descend on a thin thread until they land right between my eyes and cause me to have a panic attack. They’re unpredictable and can jump out at you, at any second, if you dare get a millimeter too close. Will they? Maybe, who knows. I’d argue the fact they may not attack you is worse because at least with most other animals, I know to run.They lay eggs in a dark corner of my closets andThey’re also intrusive. They seem to come out when it’s dark, much like rats. When I turn on the lights in a room (in which I thought was empty), the last thing I anticipate to see is the devil’s creation. I mean, a spider.There is literally no reason I would ever want a spider next to me. I can admit to it being a cool and unique animal, but no, thank you.Funnily enough, I have no problem with snakes, which are probably a thousand times more venomous.
