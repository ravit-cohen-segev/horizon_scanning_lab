1,"This is more public knowledge involving technology, but much of the plot of Lethal Weapon 3 is based on inaccurate news reporting of teflon coated bullets being armor defeating. I think the guy even shoots through the bucket or blade of some industrial power equipment to kill someone with one at the end.But yeah, it seems real odd watching the movie now, considering that it's been widely discredited, but was, at one point, such a believable news story that a blockbuster action film was built around it.","5,361 followers",Valerio Cietto,677,2.4K,9.1M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-movies-would-not-work-today-because-technology-has-evolved

8,"You'll need to define ""meaningful technology."" It would seem to me that meaningful technology predates Homo sapiens sapiens. Our not-quite-human ancestors were already using fire, something no other species (well, genus anyway) has ever done, and we were making unprecedented use of stone tools.
