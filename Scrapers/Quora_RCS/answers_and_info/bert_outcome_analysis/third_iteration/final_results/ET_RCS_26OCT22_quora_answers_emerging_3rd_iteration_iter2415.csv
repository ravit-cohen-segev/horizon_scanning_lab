9,"Science is advanced when new discoveries are made that previously were unknown. Without thorough research we cannot make advances. Sometimes the science from the past was not well researched due to no computer science and lack of mathematical knowledge. Newton never knew that F=ma^2 is a fact now because he did not have knowledge of acceleration factors. Plainly spelled out this formula looks like this (Force=mass x acceleration x 2000) You should never accept anyone’s work absolutely perfect until there are no doubts about its outcome or results.I am helping our science advance that is what aScience is advanced when new discoveries are made that previously were unknown.

Plainly spelled out this formula looks like this (Force=mass x acceleration x 2000) You should never accept anyone’s work absolutely perfect until there are no doubts about its outcome or results.I am helping our science advance that is what a good scientist should always do.The time it takes for a photon to accelerate from its source to a natural speed limit = 23,321 thousandths of a second. This means E=mv^3 where light is variable not constant.If you have a photon in a vacuum light lab environment and you run the photon thru various shades of glass this makes the photon decelerate. Now with that information you have two or three reference points of speed other than your original value. This original speed or commonly known as the speed of light in a vacuum which should only be used as one of the points of reference for the speed of a light photon. Then deriving with the other values found at the shades of glass now chart them on a linear graph from zero to about 832 times the speed of light full speed of a photon from a source. Then you know as a fact that speed of light is variable. If you have a magnifying glass you can make photons accelerate thru the magnifying glass at the focal point 11.832 % faster than source of the light or Sun’s light speed.","246,826 followers",Dushka Zapata,1.5K,8.5K,232.3M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Which-laboratory-has-the-most-advanced-technology-Why

Israel is an immigrant country - Much like the U.S, the Israeli human landscape is a combination of various cultures, various schools of thought and approaches and - as such - is a breeding ground for new takes on a matter.This was part of the United States secret sauce.2. Necessity is the mother of invention - Unique needs in the security, agriculture, energy, and other sectors brought about the birth of inventions in military, communications, medicine, irrigation, solar energy fields - you name it.3. Education - From its inception Israel has put an emphasis on the importance of education: From Elementary to Academic - and in spite of its small size, it holds some of the world's leading academic institutions.4. Investment in innovation - 5% of Israel's GDP is invested into the private sector through various plans and grants of the Office of the Chief Scientist [ http://www.moital.gov.il/CmsTamat/Rsrc/MadaanEnglish/MadaanEnglish.html ] in the ministry of Economy - No country in the world comes close to this percentage.From as early as seed stage companies, to as far as publicly traded technology companies, Israeli tech innovators enjoy these grants and investments, aimed at increasing the amount of Israeli Intellectual Property and successful tech companies.But it doesn't end there.ALL major global tech companies have R&D centers in Israel : Amazon, Apple, Google, Intel, Microsoft, Qualcomm, Samsung, Facebook - you name it: They're here. And it's a win-win situation.Also, approximately 80% of the private investments made into Israeli startups comes from overseas.This is on top of a vibrant, and experienced Israeli Venture Capital ecosystem, which is now entering it's third decade.5. The IDF technologies - Tech developments for special forces, air force, ground forces, navy etc., later find their way into private market applications, giving the companies a unique edge over global competitors. Given Imaging [ http://www.givenimaging.com/en-us/Pages/default.aspx ] is a great example.6. Unique intelligence and data tech capabilities - The Mossad, Military Intel, Cyber warfare units, other agencies - No need to elaborate on the fact that some of the best - if not the best - minds in intelligence work for Israel. Young Israelis undergo unparalleled training and engage in sci-fi like activities.Then they leave the service.Now what do you think they're going to do?7. The military service - By definition, the fact that at a young age an Israeli has to learn what responsibility means, what challenges are, what a mature set of proportions is, molds many Israelis into potential entrepreneurs and leaders. (see comment by Ahuvah Berger-Burcat [ https://www.quora.com/profile/Ahuvah-Berger-Burcat ] for elaboration on this)8. Local market too small - From day 1 Israeli startups think globally. There is no point in aiming for the local market. It's tiny.You aim for the needs of the giants.BTW - many Israeli solutions are aimed at giving the little guy a chance to play in the big league, and it makes perfect sense in light of the above - they invented the tools THEY needed: Fiverr, EatWith, DubaMobile, Wix.9. ""Chutzpa"" - It's a Hebrew word for attitude, sort of (Sorry republicans) a ""Yes We Can"" state of mind.""Of course our underfunded, 3 people strong, Middle East based startup will kick IMB's ass!

The Eldar expanded their borders with armies of automatons and wraithbone drones like the wraithknights. Their pinnacle of warp science was that the gods the modern Eldar worship such as Vaul, Asuryan, Khaine and so on were all created to enhance and give boons to their related domains. Vaul was created as an assistant to Eldar craftsmen. Isha would act as a warden to any Eldar who fell ill.In essence, the Eldar created the spiritual version of an AI matrix to solve their problems. This isn’t technology as the Golden Age mankind had but it is a solution to a problem, which is what defines something as technology.Eldar knowledge of the Warp was so sophisticated that its use and understanding could count as a branch of science.Even the more mundane technology appears very high up the tree. Brightlances function very similar to las-weapons but are far more precise and energy-efficient, more effective at burning though whatever composites are popular in the manufactories. It took psychic energy to make the crystals that make this possible but again, this is a solution to a problem so it is possible to say that brightlances are more technologically advanced than lance weapons. Meanwhile the mobility differences between Eldar and Imperial titans are almost mirror to the differences between a Gundam and ED-209. Sure they’re of vastly different scales but in terms of mobility on the battlefield it’s a good comparison.The key difference between the two appears to be that while Eldar industry is craft-oriented due to the need of an intelligence to sculpt wraithbone, Golden Age humanity were able to refine the concepts of mass production and replaceable parts to such a degree that they built digital libraries of schematics that could instruct people with practically zero technical experience how to make a plasma reactor, a heavy tank or a laser gun to name a few. Most of what has been found was intended to help set up colonies on new worlds but this gives a potential indicator of what the Human Federation could achieve at its height.There’s just so much we don’t know about either empire. While much of the technical knowhow from the Golden Age was lost due to the disappearance of most of the STCs and the so-far mythological status of a fully preserved STC, the Craftworld Eldar left behind technologies that they believed contributed to the decline of Eldar society or couldn’t find the time to gather as they fled annihilation. This includes significant things like tools to resurrect the fallen in new Eldar bodies as well as a number of smaller devices designed to make life easier and more leisurely. The spirit stones the Eldar adorn themselves with cannot be made from scratch and can only be made from the crystallised warp energy that forms on the Crone Worlds deep in the Eye of Terror. They have fallen so far that they describe the formation of these crystals (which was in all likelihood could have been a part of the process that allowed the Eldar to overcome death) as one of their gods collecting the tears of another god and forging them into crystals that could contain souls.Imagine if explaining the iPod became a tale of how a god touched sand and copper in Arizona with the ability to trap and store the songs of ten thousand artists, and can perform any one of them whenever asked. That is what has happened to the Eldar knowledge of how to create a spirit-preservation device.This is how the Eldar gods became icons of worship.Both the Eldar (Craftworld and Dark) and the Imperium are pale shadows of their predecessors, but from what we can gather the Eldar Empire at its apex was a realm of godlike beings. Even as huamnity dominated the galaxy in the Golden Age the Eldar Empire remained masters of the galaxy until their fall which coincided with the end of the Age of Strife. So I’m going to have to say the former Eldar Empire was the more advanced one.",256 followers,Priyal Gupta,9.7K,0,0,2017,https://www.quora.com/Which-laboratory-has-the-most-advanced-technology-Why

If the entire idea of it is based on using what exists for energy purposes… what if a society never had the hair-brained idea to pull a Starkiller Base?While having the technology to use anything for energy purposes would be a clear indicator of a civilization’s advancement… what good would come of harvesting a black hole?However, that said the Wikipedia article also mentions that simple mathematical formulas can be used as indicators as well. I don’t now how much energy is drawn from the Warp and or harvested from worlds in Mankind’s domain, but it is possible they could easily reach those numbers simply by calculating the million worlds at their disposal.During Mankind’s golden age I would argue that they were easily a type 3 civilization. I cover a lot of what was possible to Mankind during the Dark Age of TechnologyGiven that Mankind was spread throughout the entire Milky Way and had the ability to terraform worlds and get resources from one corner to the other… that seems pretty impressive to me.Now, in the 40th millennium Mankind has lost a lot of its knowledge, but thanks to the dummy proofing of their ancestors they still have a lot of ability at their finger tips.Comparing Starkiller base and its star draining ability (which I believe counts asFor the Imperium that is a Tuesday… they just don’t need harvest suns for it because their void craft have that ability packed into all manner of other weaponry at their disposal.With that I would argue that that in 40k the Imperium is at least Type 2 on the Kardashev scale. As they are spread throughout the galaxy harvesting a million worlds to pump into the war effort I would question if they could not meet the requirements of Type 3 still…The big thing I think is, as I said above, whether or not Mankind was pumping out that much power doesn’t mean they were not capable of it… Mankind does easily count as a galactic civilization.…I would also argue that the Tyranids should easily count as a Type 4 civilization given their abilities…","5,990 followers",Jens Böttiger,566,2.6K,17.6M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Which-laboratory-has-the-most-advanced-technology-Why

Germany is not the most technologically advanced country. It could be pretty close, but there are major elements of society who dedicate themselves to making sure that Germany uses inferior technology that kills more people, damages the environment more, costs more money, and will cause the total collapse of Earth’s biosphere due to a runaway greenhouse effect. Mostly in the Green Party. Because radiation from nuclear accidents is apparently scarier than way more people dying of regular pollution constantly and the total annihilation of all life on Earth as the oceans boil away.","1,594 followers",Michael Van In,632,1.5K,2.9M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Which-laboratory-has-the-most-advanced-technology-Why
