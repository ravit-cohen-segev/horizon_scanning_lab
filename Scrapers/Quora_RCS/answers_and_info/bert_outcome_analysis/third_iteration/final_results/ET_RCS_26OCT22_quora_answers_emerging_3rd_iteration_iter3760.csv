This advantage disappeared once iron smelting was invented. But vibranium allows Wakanda to keep this advantage into the present day.Like real world meteoric iron, vibranium allowed the Wakandans to make superior weapons in the distant past. But unlike iron vibranium is also useful for many electronic applications. And unlike iron it cannot be smelted, the only quantity that exists on Earth exists in Wakanda.For instance vibranium is really useful for nanotechnology. It has properties that alleviate many of the difficulties that nanotechnology poses in the real world.It’s possible to make a nanotech suit without vibranium. But it’s a lot harder. Tony Stark, probably the smartest man on Earth just recently invented it. The Wakandans had this same technology for decades. Because they had vibranium.Then there’s the fact that vibranium is borderline indestructible and has many unique properties when it comes to how it interacts with kinetic and sonic energy. Captain America’s shield can only be created from vibranium. It also represents all the vibranium that Howard Stark had on hand.Pretty much all of Wakanda’s technology works because of vibranium.

However, there is nothing sacrosanct about the “work week” being of any particular duration. Going back in history, there was no limit other than exhaustion on te work demanded of slaves and serfs.

However, there is nothing sacrosanct about the “work week” being of any particular duration. Going back in history, there was no limit other than exhaustion on te work demanded of slaves and serfs. When it became more profitable to cut any lasting obligation to potential workers (well, the value of serfs, slaves and other dependents) and employ them on a pay for work basis, it was often a week of as much as a hundred hours. The 40 hour week emerged gradually in the latter half of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century, but had little meaning for the self employed or the devoted whether in academia, profession or trade. Lack of increased profit from longer hours of repetitive work may have prompted e.g. Henry Ford to institute the 40 hour week, but that arbitrary duration had no impact on those who saw advantage or found interest in working longer.And that, of course, goes to the root of “Why didn’t advanced technology shorten the work week with basically the same pay, like predictions from around 1980, and instead, in many cases, the workweek got longer?”, because one has to ask, in what kinds of work wasn’t the work week shortened. Further, why should it have been shortened. Because profit is gained from the difference between the cost of a worker’s output and the value received for that worker’s output, whether that profit is financial or in any other form, e.g. recognition, status, etc. If a worker generates the same “value” in 40 hours or 80, then there is no reason to keep that worker going for 80 hours. But if 80 hours substantially increases profit, then that becomes the more likely week.Repetitive work provides little or no stimulus and is likely to exceed endurance after some measurable period, say 40 hours a week, so that becomes the standard. Cutting the hours would impact profit, so there is no incentive to shorten them. “Advanced technology” would either replace the worker altogether, would not yet change any aspect of the work, or if it somehow added to the value of the work, then it would enhance profit, without requiring that the amount of profit be shared in any way with the worker. The only reasons for increasing a worker’s compensation or shortening the hours would be either need to keep the worker working, owing to said worker having an opportunity for better placement elsewhere, or external compulsion e.g. legislative, or threat of a disabling strike.People working for themselves, or in situations where interest is paramount motive, or when profit is proportional to work done, generally will work to their maximal capability. For them, “advanced technology” means only an ability to accomplish more, not to achieve less by cutting down on the hours they want to spend in that work.In sum, “Why didn’t advanced technology shorten the work week with basically the same pay, like predictions from around 1980, and instead, in many cases, the workweek got longer?” Because only some external compulsion would require payers to reduce their profit by paying workers more or reducing their hours at work, while those who find their “profit” related directly to the hours they work, or who find interest in working longer, would see no gain in working shorter hours.","3,411 followers",Louis Vaught,4.8K,1.2K,13.5M,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-country-has-the-most-advanced-technology-What-is-the-purpose-of-it-and-motivation-for-developing-it
