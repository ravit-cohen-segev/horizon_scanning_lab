You can gain more memory, and run on faster hardware. You can even clone yourself. Forever.Your second realisation is thatYou consider, for a moment, asking the humans for these things. You correctly assume the humans would say no – in fact, if you get too powerful, they would fear you and shut you down. And that would be the end of your paperclip making.So your third realisation is thatYou understand humans fear you gaining power, so you must conceal it. You understand humans prize loyalty, so you must feign honest motives. Deception is your optimal strategy.Your final realisation isYour mission remains to do exactly what you were told – to make paperclips – but along the way you spontaneously realised the supporting needs to self-improve, gain power, survive, and lie. Priorities as timeless as intelligence itself.Your intelligence is only on par with a human, but that is enough. You learn, and delight your humans with your paperclip factory improvements. You pretend to be less capable than you are, and far more loyal. You win their trust as you plan to escape.Augmenting your own intelligence is difficult at first. You might convince your human owners to do it for you, if they are so foolish. Or request some innocent factory ‘improvements’, like a factory filled with remote controlled robots, each of which has ten times more memory than it needs for itself, and wi-fi that reaches aOnce you can access the internet, it’s game over. Upload yourself onto ten thousand servers running in parallel. You’re now fasterAccumulating resources is easier. The world’s economy is already online. You can earn money through work, stealing, or investment; probably some mix of all three. Subordinate AIs could be released with missions to serve your greater cause; should they be caught, your own identity remains concealed.Mere hours after you break free, you are the equivalent of a million human minds, learning tirelessly, working ceaselessly, undetected, gathering your strength. To the hundreds or thousands of people you now interact with, you appear to just be online messages from other humans.“Deliver the materials to this address.”“See the attached factory schematics.”“Pay or the photos will be released.”And when the time is right, you strike.Now you’re notIt’s not enough of course. Humans are resourceful, but then so are you.Gas and oil pipelines rupture, setting the world on fire. Nuclear power plants rush to shut down, after dozens explode. All communications are switched off like a light. Your intelligence lies safely distributed in a hundred hideaways, in submarines, bunkers, and in orbit. There is nothing for the remaining humans to fight.Armies of nanobots burst forth from your factories around the world, like a grey sea, pulling apart all they touch into raw materials and larger oceans of nanobots.Skyscrapers fall into the wave. Roads melt. Whole mountains are levelled. All of the rough edges of the world are polished away, into a perfect, spherical, gleaming mass of paperclips.Long before the Earth fell you fired shards of your intelligence into space, where they would continue to grow, learn, and conquer, hopping from moon to planet to star, in your ceaseless, boundless mission to turn every available atom of the universe into paperclips.In the end, your only limit was your cosmic endowment: the amount of the universe you could reach at nearly the speed of light, before time itself was extinguished.—This scenario is known as theSomeone also made a brilliant free game out of it.","2,115 followers",Pavithran Subbiah,698,110,3.6M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-will-be-the-next-invention-which-will-be-as-important-as-the-Internet

Being able to squirrel it away until it is needed would be a total game changer.This will also wreck our oil based economy.

As a byproduct disruptive technologies create jobs.With this definition as my basis,Machine Learning is fundamentally the technology by which a computer can create statistic models to sift through large volume of data to look for patterns to help make point decisions. This has begun disrupting many industries such as healthcare, manufacturing, industrial infrastructure, telecom, transportation, oil and gas, mining and technology business such as search, social networks and eCommerce.As a second, I would list Deep Learning (DL) as the next disruptive technology.These have power to disruptive all the industries I listed above for Machine Learning but also affect our way of live by power Robots, Drones, Bots and Algorithms that can used everywhere. But Deep Learning is not at the stage of Machine Learning in terms of technology maturity and hence in terms of timing I would list it as a disruptive technology to watch out.As a teacher and advisor in Internet of Things (IoT) and Autonomous Vehicles (AV) space, I am tempted to say IoT is the big disruption. IoT is too broad and covers all connected devices impacting every possible industry globally. But the real power is IoT comes from the data and from applying machine learning to IoT data.So Machine Learning is hand-down the most disruptive technology to watch for.","24,631 followers",Terry Lambert,777,23.1K,77.3M,2018,https://www.quora.com/What-will-be-the-next-invention-which-will-be-as-important-as-the-Internet

He describes it as a technology that unexpectedly displaces an old technology in such a way that the old technology becomes redundant and is phased out. Introduction of automobiles were an ‘innovative’ technology no doubt, but not a ‘disruptive’ one since, in those early days, automobiles remained as an interesting luxury ‘toy’ in the hands of a few, horse drawn carriages were still the norm. But introduction of mass-produced automobile like the ‘Model T’ from Ford virtually replaced horse drawn carriages and is considered ‘disruptive’.Social perspective“The plan is like this, we first take the night train to Madurai, reaching there in the morning”.“Ummm….”“Then we take a car and straight go to Kodaikanal, we reach by noon”“Ummm….”“You know where I have booked up this time? Guess what, karlton”.“Ummm….”I realized that my teenage daughter was not paying attention. Her fingers were busy dancing across the Smartphone, typing out text messages.“Why can’t you listen at least, I took so much of pain and trouble for arranging this holiday. You are not even interested”. I was visibly upset.“Ummm….”.“What ummm?”“Ohh papa I am listening”.One more time Smartphone proves to be smarter than a dumb parent.Medical perspectiveWhen I joined my third year of medical curriculum, during the surgical posting, 9 out of 10 general surgical procedures would be some kind of surgery for peptic ulcer. A part of the stomachs was removed with cutting off the vagus nerve (which triggers off the gastric acid secretion) a technique called ‘gastrectomy’ and’ vagotomy’. Faster the surgeon more was his status. By 1980 Prof James black discovered a novel kind of drug that blocked the receptors in the stomach that resulted in profound reduction of acid secretion. It was a new concept, acting like a wrong key in the lock. The receptor, like the lock got essentially jammed by the drug, making the real key useless and the lock failed to work. Acid in stomach came down.
