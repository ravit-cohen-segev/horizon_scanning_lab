1,"You cannot become a billionaire just by passing out of an institution. It means nothing. Unless of course you already are a multi-millioniare. What can probably happen is that after working for few years after IIM, you gain valuable insights in how to run a particular business profitabily and then you start your own business. Most wealth comes from enterprise and other welathy people simply inherit it. So start an enterprise and you don't need an IIM degree for that.","2,308 followers",Lucas Cutrim,4.4K,384,5.9M,2021,https://www.quora.com/I-want-to-become-a-billionaire-Is-it-possible-after-passing-out-from-IIM

Despite earning a scholarship, he still didn't think he was smart enough to compete with others. So, Bezos switched from physics to electrical engineering and computer science, starting an amazing life journey.Such an epiphany came from a math problem. "" I couldn't solve the partial differential equation, it was really hard, recalls Bezos. At the time, I was studying with my roommate Joe, who was also very good at math. The two of us spent three hours working on this one assignment and came up empty.""At a loss, Bezos and his roommate eventually turned to friend Yashanta Rajakarunayak for help. ""We showed him the problem, and he stared at it for a while and then said 'the answer is cosine.' I was surprised and asked 'that's the answer'. He seemed quite sure and ran the calculations for both of us.""Through three pages of detailed algebraic calculations, the answer that Yashanta eventually came up with was indeed cosine. Bezos asked him if that was what he had just done in his head, and Yasantha replied, ""No, that's not possible. Three years ago, I answered a very similar question. When I mapped this problem onto that one, the answer was clear.""At that moment, Bezos suddenly realized that he should have pursued a different career. ""That was a very important moment for me, because it was at that moment that I realized I might never be a great theoretical physicist. I began to self-reflect. In most careers, 90 percent of people can contribute. But in theoretical physics, you have to be among the top 50 in the world, or you really can't help much.""He goes on to recall, ""I looked around the room and then became acutely aware that there were three people in the class who were much better at physics than I was. For them, physics was much easier. These people's brains are connected differently than ours, and the discovery was astounding.""After that, Bezos turned to electrical engineering and computer science and ""dedicated himself to starting and running his own business."" In 1994, while working at a hedge fund, Bezos discovered a startling statistic that the Web was growing at a rate of 2,300 percent per year, which inspired him to start Amazon, an online bookstore, in 1995. Today, Amazon's market capitalization is over $1 trillion and Bezos sits as the world's richest man.","1,891 followers",Athanasios Canko,4.3K,318,2.9M,2020,https://www.quora.com/I-want-to-become-a-billionaire-Is-it-possible-after-passing-out-from-IIM

I got mad, I yelled at my dad for not working harder in life, so as to afford the best for me just like other wealthy parents.But then I realized that anger and jealousy weren't getting me that far. In fact, they weren't getting me anywhere at all. But theyLuckily I am apparently blessed with a good brain, therefore I was able to learn four programming languages by the age of 17, and several IDEs to create software. All of it came from self-learning late at night. While rich kids were partying, I learnt programming.The result? Now I am 19, and I am a competent iOS freelance developer. I have a mobile game on App Store and I am about to publish another one. I've created two more apps for foreign customers, one in China and one in NY, and I own a small distribution e-shop in Albania, from where I sell imported USBs and other pocket goods. I am also working on a startup IT project, which I am bootstrapping with some other co-founders.Am I rich? Not yet. Am I ahead of other teenagers? Hell yeah. No teenager in Albania has made such progress yet (as far as I know). How did I get motivated to work hard? Jealousy.The key: Let yourself become jealous, it is a good source of motivation. I find anger and jealousy the things that wake me up every morning with the desire to become better and to surpass others.Some call this arrogance, others call it inspiration. I call it a way of living, which is working quite well for me. I suggest you give it a try.Nevertheless, don't envy rich kids that much.

I’ve learned plenty of skills while working for them, and the salary is quite good for a 21-year-old like me. I am also responsible for growing its team so I’ve got more than 10 people under my tutelage.Before this, I created a startup to build the first Albanian speech recognition system. The exceedingly kind James Baker agreed to help us, given that he is an expert in this field, but my former team’s lack of good math knowledge + school duties have currently put that project into hiatus (Given that these two endeavours took most of my time, and one of them proved to be quite profitable, I closed my small e-shop. When it came to time/profit ratio, it wasn’t as worth as my other stuff.I’ve also kept up with iOS development, but I’ve made it more of a hobby stuff rather than freelance work. Once iOS 11 pops up, and the iPhone 8 is out, I may get back to it more seriously.So all in all I’m still doing good. I’ve made some good money for a student and I’ve put that into savings. Thankfully these endeavours have given me some good work experience with real-life projects, so I think getting jobs is easier for me now compared to others.I also realized that creating a startup of my own and making big-time profits will take lots of skill and money, so I’ll spend a few more months (or years) to grow both my skills and my wallet to afford building a business of my own.

There’s been a number of millionaires just from Facebook and YouTube let alone all the other social media, technology avenues out there. But to become a billionaire is on a totally different level. As the saying goes, millionaires rent the yachts, billionaires are the ones who own the yacht. The reason I mention yachts is because a 250ft Yacht, or larger, is the MOST expensive thing you can own. More expensive than anything else including a private jet.If you research billionaires you’ll find that they focus on 4 specific areas for making money. Inventing, Innovation, Investing and Entrepreneurs. True there are millionaires that get involved in those areas too but it’s what I mentioned above that makes the billionaire different in these areas. That’s the thinking, decision making, problem solving, and to some extent creativity that puts them on another level.You can present a single problem to 10 different people and you’ll get 9 different answers on how to solve it. 1 person will have more questions to ask before they give there solution to solving it. That’s because most of society believes they already have the knowledge, experience, know how to solve a problem without any further knowledge of the problem.My advice to you if you want to become a billionaire is to be a leader not a follower. When you’re presented with a problem, frame the problem first before you try to answer it. You might find more information about the problem that you didn’t know at first.I’ll be looking out on Forbes for you when you make the list.",UNKNOWN,Anbazhagan Ambrose,3.7K,3.2K,39.9M,2017,https://www.quora.com/I-want-to-become-a-billionaire-Is-it-possible-after-passing-out-from-IIM

I had read every book I could about Warren Buffett. And a year later I even wrote a book (I was fascinated. He was my hero. But I knew the truth about him wasn’t so simple.I was scared and jealous and shy at the annual meeting.(don’t judge a man by his clothes)I got there at 5 in the morning and there was already a big line to get in. Thousands of people there. Krispy Kreme donuts were being handed out in the dark.When the doors opened, everyone ran in to get a good seat. The floors had just been washed so everyone was slipping and falling.The annual meeting was only ten minutes. Then the rest of the day was made up of people asking Buffett and his partner, Charlie Munger, questions.After the meeting I was taking a cab back to the hotel. The cab driver said, “Do you want to see Warren Buffett’s house?” I said, “Sure.”We drove up to a regular house on the corner of a suburban block. There was a car parked out front with a man sitting inside of it. Security.“This is it,” the cab driver said. Then he drove me back to my hotel.I ordered room service, slept, and went home. I had been too shy to talk to a single person.(Buffett’s Omaha house)Oh! Except for one.One guy told me he had bought 200 shares of Berkshire Hathaway in the 1970s. “Someone told me this guy was smart so I bought 200 shares.“It doubled within a year. I felt like I was rich!“I sold 100 of the shares and started a restaurant. We ran that restaurant for 20 years.“The other 100 shares is worth $15 million.”“What do you do now?”He laughed. “Half the time I ski. And half the time I regret selling those first 100 shares.”There’s a lot of myths about Warren Buffett.And he’s not your grandpa.WARREN BUFFETT RULE #1: USE THE RIGHT BUSINESS MODEL TO INVESTFirst, some basic concepts that are important to understand:WHAT IS A HEDGE FUND?:The hedge fund manager makes money by charging you 2% per year of the money you put in (if you put in $1,000,000 they take $20,000 per year).They also take 20% of the profits. (If they return 10% on your $1,000,000 - a $100,000 profit - they take 20% of that, or $20,000).So a “2 and 20” fund would make $40,000 on a $1,000,000 investment that returns 10% that year.If a hedge fund has $1,000,000,000 in it then they would make $40,000,000 just on the fees.THAT is how hedge fund managers get rich. From fees.WHAT IS A BANK?It’s important to know how banks make money. Because it’s not very different from a hedge fund.You “Lend” the bank money when you open a checking account or savings account.They then give you a small interest rate return on your savings account (let’s say it’s 1%, although even that is high right now).They lend out the money to people who buy homes (they do other loans but this is most common). They charge (let’s say) 7%.The difference between 7% and 1% (minus the cost of their branches and bank tellers) is what they make. (This is rough but roughly accurate).So if you put $100,000 in a savings account, you might make $1,000 a year. They lend the $100,000 out at 7% (7,000 a year) and they make $6,000.That is how a bank makes money. In one sentence: you lend them money, they invest it (by lending it to homeowners) and they take 100% of the difference each year until you take your money out.Note: hedge funds make 20% of the profits. Banks make 100% of the profits.INSURANCE COMPANY:Similar to a bank and a hedge fund: You give them money, they invest it.Small differences: You give them money, but YOU NEVER WANT THAT MONEY BACK. If you get that money back it means something bad happened to you.This is different from a bank where the bank is simply holding your money until you take it back.An insurance company tries to never give you your money back.Then they invest it in (mostly) whatever they want. And they keep 100% of the profits. You don't keep any of that.An insurance company takes money from you every month (so you keep having insurance).Sometimes they return money each month to people who get sick.This is called “the cost of the float”. Sometimes they make money on that (they give out less than they take in). Sometimes they even lose money on the float. And then they only make money on their investments (minus the cost of the float).A bad insurance company has a high cost of float (they give out more than they take in).A good insurance company breaks even on float (they give out each month, roughly what they take in - i.e. people get sick, etc).A great insurance company makes money on BOTH the float (they only take money from people who they think won’t be sick and will never get their money back) and on their investments.(Foreshadowing: Warren Buffett runs a great insurance company).Insurance companies use statistics to see who are good risks to take money from and they use statistics to figure out how much money you should give.Extreme example: A 90 year old who wants life insurance will have to spend a lot more money than a healthy 20 year old woman.These are important things to understand to understand Warren Buffett.NOTE: Banks and Insurance companies both make 100% of the profits. BUT insurance companies don’t have to give the money back when the customer wants.To summarize:A hedge fund takes your money for a short time and takes 20% of the profits.A bank takes your money for a period of time and takes 100% of the profits until you take your money back.An insurance company takes your money FOREVER and keeps 100% of the profits.—Warren Buffett made his first million by running a hedge fund.Then he switched to owning small banks. Then finally he shut down his hedge fund and put all his money into running an insurance company.An insurance company is a hedge fund that KEEPS the investors money and KEEPS 100% of the profits.It’s the best business model in the world.It makes FIVE TIMES what a hedge fund would make and never has to worry about anxious investors pulling money away.WARREN BUFFETT SECRET #2: GET A DEALWarren Buffett doesn’t buy stocks like you and me. He doesn’t say, “Oh! Apple dropped 9% yesterday, I better go out there and buy shares.”This is how weak investors invest. Warren Buffett is not a weak investor.You always want to get special treatment over everyone else in order to make money.Else you are like the masses who, on average, do not make money. The average retail investor loses money every year no matter what the stock market does.What do I mean by, “A deal”.If a stock is at $100, that’s where civilians are buying it.Warren Buffett is not a civilian. He gets it cheaper, better, smarter.ExampleThe stock was at $115. Warren Buffett could have just bought shares. He was a believer.(Goldman Sachs stock crashing between November 2007 and one year later. Guess which point in this chart Warren Buffett got his “deal”).But that’s what a civilian would do.Instead, Warren Buffett called them up and offered them a deal they couldn’t refuse when everyone was losing faith in them.Lesson #1: Find a company that is desperate.Here was the deal:He invested $5,000,000,000. That would be 50,000,000 COMMON shares if he was a normal investor.A) Get 50,000,000 PREFERRED SHARES at $100. What is this? If Goldman goes bankrupt, then Warren Buffett would come BEFORE regular shareholders (the civilians) when Goldman liquidated.He would be FIRST in line to get the proceeds of the liquidation. So the odds of him losing money were basically zero.And note: he paid $100 a share instead of $115. So he got a discount nobody else could get.B) He got 43 million warrants FOR FREE to buy GS stock at $115. We’ll see what this means in a second.C) He got a 10% dividend. That means while he was still in the investment Goldman Sachs would pay him $500,000,000 A YEAR.So if he just sat on the investment for 10 years, even if GS stock went down to $20, he’d make all his money back. So he gives himself several ways to make money back even if things go bad.NOTE: GS only pays a 1.93% dividend. So Buffett was getting five times the normal dividend.Here’s what happened:2 years later, Goldman Sachs bought back his preferred shares for $5.64 BILLION.They paid him a premium to convince him to sell. And they gave him his dividend. So he made a quick $640 million.When Goldman Sachs stock was at $190, Buffett (who at this point had made $640 million profit in the bank) who had paid ZERO dollars for his warrants did something called “Exercising the Warrants”.He FINALLY paid $115 a share for his 43,000,000 shares (this is what a warrant is. It’s the right to LATER pay the price for the shares.) and then A SECOND LATER, sold those shares for $190.This was an extra 3,225,000,000 profit FOR FREE.So altogether, because of the fact that he got a special deal, he made a $4,000,000,000 profit.If he DID NOT have the special deal, two things would have happened:A) He was at much greater risk of losing all his money. The “preferred” aspect plus the dividend helped reduce the risk considerably.B) He got his money back with profit just two years later. So now he had his 43,000,000 warrants without paying a dime for them. Anyone else would have just made the profit and that’s that.He made an extra $3.22 BILLION dollars at ZERO COST.That’s a deal!He got that deal because he was “the Warren Buffett”. A persona, a super hero, a beacon of confidence that Goldman Sachs desperately needed.You get GREAT deals when you build up a significant persona, and the other side is significantly desperate.Else, the best strategy, as Warren Buffett says, is to “sit on your hands”.BUT…CAN YOU GET THESE DEALS IF YOU HAVE NOTHING?Yes, Warren Buffett has been getting deals since the day he started. He almost NEVER bought a significant amount of stock without a special deal.ExampleHe once saw a small penny stock (when you have a smaller amount of money, you get deals on smaller stocks) that was trading for less than their liquidation value.In other words, let’s say a stock was $10 but if you sold everything they had, you would have $12 a share in cash, then you can buy a lot of the stock, confident that in a worst case, they would liquidate and you would either make money or at least get your money back.These are called “cigar butt stocks”. The phrase was coined by Benjamin Graham, Warren Buffett’s mentor (who wouldn’t hire Warren because he was only hiring jewish people).Warren saw a stock that was trading below liquidation value. So he bought a lot of the shares, and then HE CALLED THE CEO.He gave the CEO “advice”. Since you have so much extra money and assets, buy back shares at a higher price than you are trading so your stock price could go higher (the fewer shares outstanding, the more likely the stock will go up if there are buyers).The CEO told him what price he would buy Warren’s shares and they did the deal. So Warren basically worked out in a private deal with the CEO an almost instant profit.This was in the mid-60s. Warren was a young hedge fund manager. Nobody knew who he was. But he was aggressive about always getting a deal.Then he bought shares of the same company again.He called the CEO. He made the same deal. But this time the CEO said, “I’ll pay you less than you want but still a decent price.”Warren didn’t like that at all! Don’t mess with Warren Buffett!!!He bought up more than 50% of the shares. He then fired the CEO.The company was a little-known penny stock that made textiles. It was called “Berkshire Hathaway”.Warren knew that insurance companies were better business models than hedge funds. He had been running his hedge fund for ten years but he wanted a better deal than only 20% of the profits.He wanted 100% of the profits!So he started buying insurance companies.He shut down his hedge fund and switched all his focus to the better business model. And he kept doing deals with small penny stock companies.EXAMPLE 3:After 9/11 Warren Buffett went on CNBC and said there is an almost certain chance that a nuclear weapon will be used on US soil in the next 50 years.Shock and Awe!With his insurance company he then started a new product: nuclear attack insurance.Big events like the Super Bowl would buy Nuclear Attack Insurance for millions of dollars.If there was no nuclear attack (highly unlikely) then Buffett would collect millions for free (this is how he kept the “cost of float” profitable for him).If there was a nuclear attack then, well, we have more to worry about than insurance.WARREN BUFFETT RULE #3: KEEP OTHER PEOPLE POORWarren Buffett has a folksy story about his secretary. “She pays more taxes than me!”That’s because she makes a salary!Warren Buffett is rich because he owns $80 BILLION worth of Berkshire Hathaway stock. BUT YOU DON’T PAY TAXES until you sell the stock.His salary is something like $1 a year.So EVERYONE pays more income taxes than Warren Buffett.(Warren Buffett’s will do anything to avoid paying taxes)But he uses that line to get Congress to raise taxes on the middle class and upper middle class. Higher taxes means the middle class has less money to spend on products and they have to work harder for every dollar they save for retirement.If you are rich and most people are desperate, then you find more deals.WARREN BUFFETT RULE #4: BUILD A PERSONAWarren Buffett is everyone’s grandpa.He has folksy wisdom like: “When hamburgers are cheap, buy them. Why do people buy stocks when they are more expensive?”Or, “Long ago, Charlie [Munger] laid out his strongest ambition: All I want to know is where I'm going to die, so I'll never go there. “Nice and folksy way of saying, “life is uncertain but you can’t worry about that uncertainty.”Using this folksy wisdom he has been an advisor to the CEOs of the biggest companies, Presidents, other billionaires, etc.Why be an advisor? To get deals!Part of his persona is to be relatable.He focuses on his small house in Omaha. He never mentions he used to have an enormous mansion in California.He focuses on the fact that his kids will inherit nothing.He doesn’t mention he gave them each a $3,000,000,000 (three billion!) charitable foundation.With a charitable foundation like that, they can take a salary of tens of millions per year.And because these were set up as charities, when Buffett dies, none of his kids will have to pay an inheritance tax.Nor will Buffett pay the enormous estate tax that every other rich family has to pay because he has pledged to donate the remainder of his money to Bill Gates charity.I am not saying this is not a generous thing to do. It is very generous. But it does mean I will not listen to what Buffett says about taxes since he has done a very good job at avoiding them.WARREN BUFFETT RULE #5: TIME IN A BOTTLETime management.Warren works all day. As he says, “I skip to work” .But he delegates the management of all the businesses he owns (from Fruit of the Loom to See’s Candies to the huge insurance companies).And he only gets involved in investments when he gets deals so good that they are easy for him to say “Yes” to. Which is rare but he is fine waiting and being patient.And then rest of the day he reads and he plays bridge.(the most valuable Bridge game in the world. Get in this game if you can).He has a great life. I wouldn’t trade mine for his but I admire how he set up his life.Reading is the best way to make sure you have more knowledge than the people you are doing deals with.And bridge is his favorite game. It uses the brain, it uses his passion for statistics, and it’s fun (his bridge partner is usually Bill Gates)He loves his day. He loves his life.Invest your energy and time wisely because the dividends compound and produce a great life.And THAT is how Warren Buffett gets rich.SOURCESNote: Some of this is based on the book I wrote in 2005: “Trade Like Warren Buffett”.Some of this is based on the many articles I’ve written about Buffett since then.Some of this is based on research I did as an advisor to the TV show “Billions”.Some of this is based on the many discussions I’ve had with billionaires for my upcoming book, “Think Like a Billionaire”.And some of this is based on my years as a hedge fund manager.Other sources:","38,614 followers",Krishna Suryakanth,1K,2K,76M,2019,https://www.quora.com/I-want-to-become-a-billionaire-Is-it-possible-after-passing-out-from-IIM

And there was no way in hellIn Operation Desert Storm, Saudi’s named the F-117 ""Shaba,” Arabic for ""Ghost.""Since other Answers here provide such extraordinary technical details—I’ve learned a lot—I shall do what I always do in these circumstances: tell (true) stories.In the late ’70s, I was in flight training at Burbank Airport (now Bob Hope Airport), north of L.A. I chose this field for its array of flight operations: military, airline and corporate. Often, waiting in a “congo line” to take off, we’d find our little Piper Archer rocking in the kerosene exhaust of a Grumman Gulfstream, Bombardier Global Express or other biz jet. “Heavy iron,” my instructor called them. He showed me that the last two letters of the craft’s “N number” were the owner’s initials, often those of a movie star from nearby Hollywood: N904LD = Leonardo DiCaprio.There was an extremely secretive operation at Burbank: Lockheed’s famed Skunk Works. The U-2 and SR-71 Black Bird spy planes were designed here by aeronautical super starJohnson (left) withAt Burbank I befriended the tower controllers and would often climb up to the glassed-in cab—impossible these days, of course. One morning I came up and a controller said, Oh, boy! You missed the fun last night, Cameron.Seems the Air Force had called up and ordered them to douse the lights on the field at precisely midnight. Ha. The controllers pointed out that legally they couldn’t do that. The Air Force played their ace: the “national security” card. The controllers refused to fold. Nope. USAF had to settle forAt midnight, a gigantic C-5 (for you non-pilots, this is the largest USAF cargo plane) landed and trundled over to the Skunk Works, sticking its monster snout into their black hangar. Tall shrouds were erected to block view of the C-5’s loading ramp. Grim USAF security in trademark blue berets and automatic weapons established a perimeter around the mammoth plane. It hastily gobbled up something skunky and flew off.Lockheed C-5 Galaxy. Its cargo deck is 1 foot longer than the Wright Brother’s first flight.Next day, the field was abuzz as controllers, pilots and ramp boys speculated on That Top Secret Thing snatched from the Skunk Works in the night. Was Lockheed “reverse engineering” an alien craft? Gee, do you think the government really has…alien pilots on ice? You know, the usual UFO clap trap.Now, this amuses me about our Air Force.

It’s more like—forgive me, Boeing—a happily vomiting albino frog with wings. Am I too unkind?In the testosterone-drenched world of fighter pilots, flying a sexy airplane is like going on a hot date. SeenBeyond the beauty of its lines, swing-wing Tomcat could fly faster—1544 mph and further, 575 mi—than its successor, the uninspiring McDonnell Douglas Hornet, (1190 mph and 460 mi.) And Tomcat regularly blew off Air Force jocks in mock air battles.But Secretary of Defense Cheney had this inexplicable hostility toward Tomcat: it was a Grumman “jobs program.” (Hey, what defense program isn’t?) It had “60’s technology”(uh, ever heard of…upgrading?) He denied a last-minute Navy plea to keep a few beloved, yowling Tomcats around.Some say he was bribed by Boeing. Could be. He certainly went to extraordinary lengths to make sure Tomcats never flew again, ordering Grumman to destroy all its machine tooling, making it impossible to build future planes. (Can you imagine being the veteran Tomcat builder ordered to doThe only ones flying now (2021) are Iranian. Which it is why it’s illegal to own one. Parts.

Curves are very complex surfaces, with reflection angles that constantly change. Also on curved surfaces, there is a phenomenon called “Wave Creep”, where electromagnetic energy can stick to and follow a curving surface. All of these things affect the Radar Cross Section of an aircraft.At the time, computers simply lacked the power to calculate the numbers, and come up with an answer. All people could do in the 1970’s was guess and check on a radar range. The breakthrough that made Stealth possible came from a Skunkworks engineer named Denys Overholser came up with the solution:Overholser realized that the computer could find the radar cross section of aHave Blue #1 in front of it’s hangar with a technician working in the cockpit:The Have Blue flew test mission from Groom Lake, better known as Area 51 between 1977 and 1979, proving that stealth would work on a full size aircraft. The F-117 Nighthawk:Is a direct design evolution of the Have Blue, and was designed using the same computers and software.The B-2 and other Stealth aircraft were developed in the 1980’s when better computers and new modeling techniques made it possible to predict the radar signature of curved surfaces. By this time, CRAY supercomputers that could run over 1 billion calculations per second, allowing modeling of equations that were impossible to solve in 1975. Advanced modeling allowed for the modern curved shapes of stealth aircraft like the B-2 Spirit:and the F-22 Raptor:Also, the second generation stealth aircraft use more advanced radar absorbent materials (RAM) and composites that didn’t exist in 1976. These new materials are much less reflective to radar than aluminum, and lighter in weight than the RAM of the mid-1970’s. For these reasons, newer stealth planes are not only far stealthier, but more durable and less expensive to maintain than the F-117.

So whenever the baby makes any movement in her sleep or after waking up, it would give loud signals shouting “Baby is moving”He also attached that Raspberry pi with oximeter.This app would open in any web browser(after logging in) and smart phone. When ever the baby moved, it would give a loud alarm. It detects not only baby’s movements but also abnormalities in oximeter.Everybody in the house either had a laptop or smartphone with them always. So even the slightest movement would alert all of us. We would wait to see if the movement was just a normal movement in sleep or she had woken up from sleep.This equipment along with the app served its purpose really cool for two years.After two years when the trach was removed, son and daughter-in-law donated the equipment to one of local hospitals.Many people advised him to sell that app in the market and make some money. But he was against it. He made the code public. Location of these files is available in the answer I have mentioned above.After 2 years the trach was removed. Now she is the most mischievous chatterbox.",26 followers,Balaji Viswanathan,841,5.6K,427.1M,2019,https://www.quora.com/I-want-to-become-a-billionaire-Is-it-possible-after-passing-out-from-IIM
