The long-term wisdom of that view is debatable, people have been predicting the obsolescence of tanks for decades and they seem to remain useful on the battlefield. Britain didn’t anticipate a need large armoured forces for a desert war in the late 80s, but it still happened.So if there was a Chally replacement, would it be German? To be honest neither the Germans nor the Americans have anything in development that looks like an obvious candidate. Both are (like the British) just looking at extending and updating their existing tanks (Leopard and Abrams). Switching from an evolved Challenger to an evolved Leo 2 likely wouldn’t represent a big change in capability, so what would be the point?","2,233 followers",Tim Chisell,3.1K,1.3K,5M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Will-the-next-British-Army-Main-Battle-Tank-be-German
1,"The Germans are currently collaborating with the French to replace both the Leopard 2 and the LeClerc, so if the British want to contribute and have some input, now it probably the time to do so. A common MBT shared by the three major armed forces of NATO would probably become a common NATO tank, much like the Leopard 2 is today, and the mass production of a common NATO tank would have huge logistical and cost savings advantages.The problem, however, is most of these sorts of collaborations never work out due to conflicting requirements of the users.

British tanks, even today, use 120mm rifled cannon rather than 120mm smoothbores common among other NATO nations because the British alone among the allies use HESH (High Explosive Squash Head), which due to the nature of the shells operation does not work well with fin stabilizaton. HESH is useful for attacking hard targets like buildings and bunkers, although not particularly useful against tanks anymore. Outside of tactical requirements, there is also the issue of how to allocate the collaboration and work sharing, which also has derailed otherwise useful multi national projects.So while this is a possibility, and probably should be explored by the British Army, there do not seem to be any plans right now to even replace the Challenger at all, much less with a collaborative project or purchasing a foreign tank.",6 followers,David Atwell,1.4K,1.4K,13.9M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Will-the-next-British-Army-Main-Battle-Tank-be-German

Again, we have no idea how to make integrated circuits. We can’t even examine the chips to see what they look like at extreme magnification. The metallurgy to make turbine blades doesn’t exist and we have no way to examine them for wear. Any attempt to make new turbine blades would result in them shattering at some point in use, making the plane more dangerous to its pilot than to its opponents. And how would you transfer the code from our prototype to the copies?

17,"There’s only one thing about that an F-15 in 1916 changes the game: the pilot.The plane itself is a loss the instant it touches the ground.

Maybe in the avionics is a general purpose computer built from 1970s era technology, but building an interface without the maintenance manual wouldn’t be easy.In the cockpit there might be some marginally useful things. A non-programmable calculator would be the most powerful computer in existence until the 1950s. A programmable one, until the 70s. But anything that needs stable DC power that can’t be supplied from batteries is going to probably be destroyed in attempts to power it.So at that point, you’re left with the only real thing of use. The pilot. How they change the game depends upon who they are. If they payed attention at the Academy and steered clear of the cults that have taken residence there, they’ll at least know some WWI and post-WWI history. Using that knowledge will destroy that knowledge pretty quickly. If, on the other hand, they joined one of the cults, they’ll show up with a brand of messianic Christianity that hadn’t really been seen in Europe and perhaps very little useful historical knowledge. I doubt in either case they would be bringing enough knowledge to build a transistor or a magnetron, or even program a raspberry-pi to do ballistics calculations.So in the first case, you’d have the pilot either using their knowledge only to enrich themselves, or worrying about what change is big enough to be worth eliminating their future knowledge. Killing Hitler?In the second case, the pilot would probably want to spread their cult and try to find the best way to do that. Joining Hitler?So if this is a study for a work of fiction, I would probably have two planes go back. Now you’ve got both pilots, converging on Hitler’s jail cell.
