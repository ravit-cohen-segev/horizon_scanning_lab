Getting patients engaged in their own healthcare can only happen when the physician spends a lot of time building a rapport and a relationship with the patient.Call me old-fashioned, but I don’t think you can improve patient engagement using an app or a Robo call. I don’t think you can improve patient engagement with a Walmart card or a survey. I think the only way that you can improve patient engagement is to engage with the patient.Unfortunately, engaging with the patient requires a number of different things that are difficult if not impossible for most physicians to provide in our current healthcare environment.Right here I am going to stop and give you an important piece of truth: People don’t care how much you know unless they know how much you care.Throwing an app or a telehealth visit or some other type of technical gimmick at patients is not going to engage them in their healthcare. The only thing that is going to engage them in healthcare is a relationship with a physician that they trust who has the time to educate them, engage with them, and help them to process the ambivalence they feel about changing their lifestyle.so how do you propose that we do that? I’m glad you asked.1-Get the best and brightest physicians into primary care. Full stop. We call it Internal Medicine, Pediatrics, and Family Practice.2-The best snd brightest are going to keep going into dermatology if you pay hundreds of dollars for a skin biopsy but completely stiff Internal Medicine specialists who need to know every detail about patient care. (I have done skin biopsies for free for my patients who could not afford dermatology. The insurance does not pay me for a procedure and a “visit” on the same day, and I have patients with big copays for the fancy shit. So I literally get nothing for that, but WTF I am salaried.) BTW doing skin biopsy is really easy.3-Pay for Internal Medicine Physicians. When you cheap out on the care that matters, patients rightly perceive that nobody gives a shit, that they are getting treated like cattle, that nobody has engaged any effort to learn about them or explain anything to them, that they are getting drugs pushed on them. Is it ANY WONDER they are “not engaged” in their healthcare?4-Don’t hold your patient at arm’s length. Be human. Be culturally competent. It really helps a lot if you can go back and grow up poor. If you are already grown, go hang out at the shelter and volunteer. Keep saying to yourself: “These people are just like me, except life screwed them over.” When you are overly businesslike, and you secretly think your patients are losers, they can smell it.5-Care for real. If you can’t, you need a new job.6-Engage the patient with teaching. Swing the computer around and stand next to them and pull up a calculator for MACE risk and play with the numbers. Watch the light come in when they “get it” and understand why you want them to do what you told them to do.7-Whiteboards. Draw diagrams. Think of clever analogies to explain things. Be aware that some people like to have a mental picture. Let them take photos with their cell phones.8-Hand write what you want them to do. Those “instruction sheets” and after visit summaries are pure bullshit. If the checkout staff remembers to print them, which they usually don’t, it is so ling and standardized that even I can’t figure out WTF went on when patients hand me the sheaf of shit from their ER visit or whatever. Hand. Write. I use cardstock with stuff printed on it.9-Set goals. Like just one goal. I see hundreds of charts that say discussed diet and exercise and I know full well that it’s just a smart phrase that got populated into the chart. Are usually ask people to just make one change that they can commit to and that they can do every day and they can turn into a new habit. Just one. One of my favorite things to start out with is to get people to stop drinking their calories. Switching to drinking water is one of the simplest and most effective first steps that I do. When people see that they can commit to one change they are usually a lot more open to committing to another change. The goal has to be simple and doable. The only way you can find out what goal you’re going to recommend is if you ask the person what they do and what they eat and what they drink and how they exercise. You have to use time and get to know them. You also need to ask them what is holding them back from doing what they know they should be doing and you will find out a lot.10-People are ambivalent about change. That is where you start. You tell them it is normal to be ambivalent, and that is the ONLY way they will feel comfortable being honest with you.Good luck!

1,"Oh yea, the time of the state patrol in airplanes is over it will be a drone that that will last all day or until the fuel runs out. No more risking the pilots life or those on the ground in a crash. The state has lost helicopter and other pilots. They can do more than a pilot ever could. Next year there are states considering letting driverless trucks on the interstate and other roads. It wont be long and the cop in a cop car will reside in the back seat. The kids had a class mate 20 years ago who qualified as a drone operator. He cashed out to join a drone manufacturer. TOP secret !!!

A fighter jet with out a pilot the weaker link in a jet is now, right now. When I was in school my room mate was working on advanced G suits for the pilots, the 70s, well good thing he can retire!!!

2,"I’ve actually done this, once. I’m still pissed off about it.I was with my partner, middle of the night. That partner was kind of an asshat, in many ways. Well, since it was the middle of the night, on a dark as shit highway, I got out of the car to urinate. Yeah, standing there in the ditch, doing my thing when I hear/ see a pair of headlights come screaming by. Oh, I just rolled my eyes and zipped up, because I knew what the asshat was about to do.Yup, he chased the driver. I was…pissed. Pun intended. I walked over to a sign, leaned against it, and waited for dickhead to come back. I was honI’ve actually done this, once. I’m still pissed off about it.I was with my partner, middle of the night.

Oh, I just rolled my eyes and zipped up, because I knew what the asshat was about to do.Yup, he chased the driver. I was…pissed. Pun intended. I walked over to a sign, leaned against it, and waited for dickhead to come back. I was honestly debating doing some rather horrible shit to him. (Have you ever been locked in patrol car with an activated can of pepper spray??)Then I heard the alert tone of an officer in danger activate over my radio. I couldn’t see the stop, as dick head was over a hill and out of my view. I pulled out my flashlight and waved down the first pair of headlights I saw coming. It was a truck driver. I yelled “Take me down the road, my partner's in trouble” Dispatch had been screaming at him over the radio, but he wasn’t answering. Man, that truck driver put his best into it, and a mile or so later later, I jumped down, (I hung on the outside of the truck for the ride, cause I’m awesome…) and ran to help the dick head. (Truck driver pulled the semi across two lanes of highway to keep traffic stopped while I figured things out. Guy was straight up classy.)At this point, I was kind of hoping he was getting his ass beat, I was going to help (beat his ass…). He wasn’t. He had accidentally hit the emergency button, and had the volume all the way down on his radio. (because he’s a tool). I canceled the scores of police cars from all across the county burning up tires to help us. I waved the truck driver off, and kicked dickhead out of the driver's seat. I spent the next two hours (possibly longer…) berating him for leaving his partner. Oh I was pissed. Hell, I’m still pissed about that one.This was also like the second time the moron had done something stupid that directly affected me, and I was purple with anger. I mistakenly took it out on the next driver we stopped. I walked to the car, still fuming. He rolled down the window. I said “DON'T FUCKING SPEED!” And pointed for him to leave so I could go back to yelling at my partner.(Asshat got to try and explain to an even more pissed off Sergeant later, who slammed her office door and yelled, while I waited outside grinning. Asshole…Anyway, that’s how I kind of commandeered a truck. But legally, if the trucker hadn’t stopped, there wasn’t much I could have done. So Mr. Trucker, wherever you are, thanks, you're a good guy.",UNKNOWN,R.

3,"Simple:As far as maneuvering tactics when they're actually pursuing you, there's really no sense diving in - you've got too many things going agaiSimple:As far as maneuvering tactics when they're actually pursuing you, there's really no sense diving in - you've got too many things going against you:As you may have gathered, I am of the opinion that there is no right answer to this question. Vehicle pursuits never end well - I've never seen an authorized pursuit go down and then heard a commander say, ""Gee, that was tidy."" If the pursuit is terminated by a supervisor, it's bad because the suspect got away. If it gets authorized, it's not going to have a pretty ending, most likely. The vast majority of the time, the suspect ends up needing medical attention by the time it's over. It might be for something minor, like flushing pepper spray out of your eyes, pulling TASER barbs out of your flesh, or treating a dog bite. It might be something major, like pronouncing you and your two passengers dead after your car hits an oak tree at 107 mph (seen it - decidedly unpretty). Take all the liberties you want with your own life and death - but running from the police puts scores of people in harm's way, even for a short pursuit.No matter the charge or the perceived consequences,","51,715 followers",Chris Ebbert,1K,11.4K,278.6M,2011,https://www.quora.com/Is-the-technology-at-a-point-where-police-could-launch-a-drone-to-follow-a-car-rather-than-engage-in-a-risky-high-speed-chase
