8,The first thing that comes into my mind is the self driving car. This thing is autonomous and it can posses a lot of danger due to full control by computer as we know it.

10,"This question misrepresents the concept of “software technology”. This question implies software technology had alternatives, and somehow what we have today is the result of marketing success. This framing of software technology could be better explained as:Other than modern electronics, what other forms could logic performing technology have been achieved?It is possible to perform logic through many mechanisms: gear works with transmissions, hydraulic systems with variable pressure thresholds, similar with pneumatic tube systems.

The point being, we did all those, and settled on “electronics” because it is simply faster than the other methods.Electronics is not the only way “software technology” is performed, where my use of the term means “execute logic artificially, not with a human.”These all resolve to performing basic logic, which is then exploited by humans to create “software programs”, as complex as the human(s) are willing to get. The reason that our modern electronics is used more often rather than these alternative methods is simply because electronics are faster, and more reliable (few to no moving parts to mechanically wear or break.)",383 followers,Thomas David Kehoe,963,416,1.9M,2018,https://www.quora.com/How-can-chartered-accountants-grasp-fintech-other-emerging-technologies-Are-there-any-courses
