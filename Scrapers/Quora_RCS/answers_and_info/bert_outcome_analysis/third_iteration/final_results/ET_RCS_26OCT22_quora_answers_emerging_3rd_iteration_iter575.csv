The funding undeniably equipped them with enormous resources for expansion. The affiliate of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. is alreadyChina’s biggest online payments service and even controls the world’s largest money market fund.Analyzing the above developments we could accurately predict where FinTech is headed in 2019.1. RegTech is here to stayCompliance, Complexity, Cost and Bureaucratic processes have always stifled the development of the finance industry. The long and tedious processes have proven to be a bane for the industry. This led to the reincarnation of a morbid industry that never saw a significant thrust since the spurt of the dot-com bubble. Consequently, we are seeing a lot of financial firms shifting toIt is essentiallyRegTech startups that are creating a difference in the Compliance Sector3. Agreement express:4. Alyne:5. Surety:6. AppZen:7. AQMETRICS:2. Artificial Intelligence:In the early days of banking, bankers used to have personal connections with their customers. Each step of the banking process involved customer-client interaction. But due to the digitization of the banking process, this personal connection has been lost. So, is it possible to leverage the same technology to get that human interaction back?Source-Many believe,Let’s delve into the potential use-cases of A.I:• Security and Fraud Control• Customer Support AutomationSource:A.I driven platforms with use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) are turning more human than ever. This combined with no possible error in delivery makes it an ideal fit. Chatbots can not only answer customer queries intelligently, but they can also be integrated with social networking sites, and accept requests for applications and orders directly from social media channels.Gartner prediction for 2018, projected more than 2 billion people would be diligently using conversational A.I to interact with virtual assistants on different platforms.3.

Earlier when the FinTech hubs used to be just San Francisco, Singapore, and London, such developments are driving investors to these huge rewarding markets. This shift in the market will gain significant traction next year and developing nations would possible see tremendous growth in investments across FinTech and RegTech. Also, several financial establishments are planning to open up new premises in these countries which definitely suggests what is expected to come our way in 2019.Wrapping up:My prediction for 2019:It is big, It is growing, and It is disruptive.FinTech would be the second-most significant transformation in Finance, since the first permanent banknotesFinTech 3.0After all, it is true what they say –Originally Published on",UNKNOWN,Pallab Roy Chowdhury (GENERAL non Ews),3K,357,20.6M,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-latest-fintech-in-the-world-today

So industrial government policy has to work along with education and finance.China still isn’t there yet. There are still some technologies that China isn’t at the top. But they’re getting there.It’s a lot of hard work and most politicians don’t have the patience to do it because they want their money now. What is the point of doing something that will only benefit someone else way way down the road?Just look at what large US companies are doing. They do stock buy backs to boost stock prices, hitting their bonus targets and they get tens to hundreds of millions in bonuses. What did that do for the company? Nothing. The money should have been invested back into the business to position the business for the future.Edit (5/12/2021): I forgot to add that China also built infrastructure that is second to none. You need infrastructure in order to transport raw materials, parts, and completed goods. You need ports to put all those goods on ships. And you also need ports to unload goods coming in from other parts of the world.All of that requires heavy co-ordination and infrastructure. You need clean water and massive amounts of power to power those factories. And then you need to keep the workers fed and clean so they don’t get sick.So you need cheap and good healthcare. You need systems in place to monitor just in case of a bioweapon attack from a crazy government.All of this requires heavy investment into the civilian economy that takes ten years or more to realize. The US election cycle is two years. Yes, the President is elected every 4 years but a large part of the Congress is up for election every two years. If you lose those elections, then good luck getting anything done.So the ten year span is pretty much ignored in Western Democracies. The politicians and electorate have very short attention spans.As far as education. It isn’t enough to just throw money at the problem. You have to ensure that the education is good. Yes, you need to teach people to be innovative but you also have to have standards and you can NOT lower them. If you do, you end up with people graduating with degrees that have no idea what is going on. Which means you might as well not have bothered.",0 followers,Jin Z,773,2.8K,9.6M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Is-it-possible-to-build-an-Omni-application-on-top-of-web-technologies

An earlier diagnosis could essentially be the difference between life and death.Vocal biomarkers will gain ground in 2017.
