0,"Nope. The Soviet Union actually built nuclear reactors that were flown in space to power spy satellites. Not RTGs like Apollo or Voyager, actual criticality sustaining reactors. (They were powering a crazy big radar system, because the only thing more metal than launching a nuclear reactor into space was tracking the US Atlantic fleet in almost realtime to prepare for Armageddon apparently.) Google RORSAT or BES-5 reactor if you're curious about this. Anyway satellites are… not huge by most estimations, mass and also volume being hard things to stick on the uppey end of a rocket.

1,"A nuclear reactor is never going to be a useful power source for a tank, because no matter how small you scale it down a nuclear reactor is too damned expensive.If you have enough money to build ten tanks powered by miniature nuclear reactors, that same amount of money would get you about a thousand tanks powered by conventional engines. Those thousand tanks will do a lot more for your army than ten, even if they are slower and need to be refueled often.If you have ten nuclear tanks, then no matter how much power they have available, the enemy will find some way to disable or destroy them.

After all, there are only ten, and in order to get close enough to be of use against the enemy they will have to get close enough to be vulnerable.For this reason, nuclear engines are only militarily useful for large vehicles that can stay hundreds of miles away from the enemy and still strike at them effectively, such as aircraft carriers and submarines. Which is exactly why they are used only in this way.","220,641 followers",Franklin Veaux,3.8K,47.3K,783.1M,2018,https://www.quora.com/If-a-nuclear-reactor-could-be-scaled-down-to-the-size-of-two-ambulances-then-would-any-nation-build-a-tank-around-it
2,"·Why a nuclear powered tank or War-Mech will more than likely be directly powered by nuclear fusion -Fusion has many significant advantages when used in direct nuclear vehicle propulsion and may ultimately have advantages over any nuclear fission based small mobile reactor approach -1) Fusion has no critical mass requirement; all that a fusion reaction requires is the right conditions be met (temperature, plasma density, and confinement time) to support fusion. As a result, very tiny efficient fusion power plants can potentially be built.2) Fusion fuels are widely available on earth.

As a result, very tiny efficient fusion power plants can potentially be built.2) Fusion fuels are widely available on earth. Hydrogen (and deuterium) is the most abundant elements in the universe. Hydrogen is fully 10^10 times more abundant by atoms in the universe than any combination of fission fuels (U233, U235, Pu239). Boron-11 is another potential fusion fuel that has excellent promise for future fusion power generation. 80.1% of natural Boron is the Boron-11 isotope and over a million tons of natural Boron is currently mined each year, mostly for making glass and laundry detergent. There is already in place a fuel supply infrastructure of p-B11 fusion when fusion reactor technology becomes a commercial reality.3) When fusion fails to work, it tends to just flame out, and serious accidents and melt downs do not tend to happen4) Neutrons and gammas produced by fission reactors are hard to shield for vehicle or nuclear propulsion applications. Charged particles like protons produced from He3-He3 fusion or ""alpha particles"" produced from p-B11 fusion are somewhat easier and more cost effective to shield. A combination of magnetic fields and electrostatic fields can be used to provide a low mass solution for biological shielding needed to provide excellent operator safety for mobile He3-He3 Inertial Confinement fusion reactors.Helium3-Helium3 fusionHe3 + He3-> He4 + 2 protons + 12.86 MeV (energy)He3-He3 fusion produces only charged protons and energy (no difficult to shield neutrons at all).Charged Protons produced from He3-He3 fusion can be collected on light weight grids and screens and used to directly power electric motors that actually drive the wheels of a nuclear car. Neutronless He3-He3 fusion does not require an expensive precision turbine-generator to convert nuclear heat into electricity (for He3-He3 fusion, lower cost and lighter weight direct collection of charged particles on grids suffices).Will there ever be nuclear powered tanks or War-Mechs?Perhaps not in the near term.I believe a multi-axle all wheel drive exploratory vehicle powered by He3-He3 fusion for space planetary exploration might happen before any terrestrial nuclear vehicle application.Comparison of major fusion fuel cycles (including He3-He3)Chart of fusion fuels for mobile reactors and nuclear propulsion -",0 followers,Paul Noel,665,14.2K,22M,2018,https://www.quora.com/If-a-nuclear-reactor-could-be-scaled-down-to-the-size-of-two-ambulances-then-would-any-nation-build-a-tank-around-it
3,That is very simple to be understood. To make fusion work you need to force all hydrogen atoms to be close to each other up to the point that hydrogen will combine with other hydrogen to form helium. You can do that by a high pressure environment or high temperature created by the fission of an uranium or plutonium atomic bomb. These neutrons works like a glue connecting protons inside the nucleus. The energy is liberated when some particles are fused to become helium liberating neutrinos and gama rays. An environment with electromagnetic energy like laser may also work out.That is very simple to be understood.

4,"Because we have not solved the engineering issuesFission can happen at any temperature and pressure. It is stupidly easy to affect, once you have the materials you need. You can even do it in a plain old squash court.Chicago Pile No. 1 was assembled in a squash court. (Fusion on the other hand requires enormous temperatures to affect, in the millions of degrees.This can be achieved in small scale quite easily.

Neutrons are a right nuisance to deal with because they make things that they impact radioactive. And since they areSo, the issue is: for fission reaction, the engineering problems have solutions.

6,"Viktor Toth nailed it. I just want to give him a thumbs-up for citing an astonishing, but true fact.

7,"I think it’s every humans experience in life that destroying something is always easier then creating something.Same goes for nuclear power: Fission is the process of splitting atoms into smaller nuclei (destroying the original atom), while fusion is the process of combining atoms creating a new one.

8,"The short answer is “because it’s darned hard to get this to work.” Scientists and engineers (because engineering is a lot of what is involved) has been working on the problem for 70+ years and, although progress has been made, there is still no fusion reactor that produces more energy than it consumes, which, as you might expect, is a bit of a shortcoming for a power plant.Why is it so difficult?

Although presented as simply flip sides of the same coin — fission breaks up atomic nuclei and fusion forces them together — fission and fusion are different in a fundamental and problematic way: fission occurs naturally on earth without any human intervention. If we do nothing, nuclei of radioactive atoms will continue to break apart. Our engineering of fission power plants (by which I am also including fuel refining) is designed to increase the number of fissioning atoms that occur per unit of time and to trap the heat energy that results for use in running a turbine attached to a generator. And to keep it safe from escaping outside the reactor.Fusion, on the other hand,One of the ways that progress has been made is that scientists and engineers have agreed on what the big challenges are and have split up those challenges among several labs in several countries. Some labs are working on the best way to confine a fusion plasma (an ultra-hot stream of ions of fusible fuel), the best way to “ignite” the plasma, the best way to control the plasma so that it doesn’t de-stabilize and stop, and best ways to harness the energy of the fusion that is happening in the plasma.","220,641 followers",Franklin Veaux,1.6K,47.3K,783.1M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Why-do-nuclear-power-plants-use-fission-but-not-fusion

Solar panels don’t use fuel and are basically set and forget; yet we can compute a price for solar electricity.So it will be with fusion.It’s very likely that a device which can survive having sustained fusion reactions inside and operate commercially, will be made of expensive components (dealing with 100 million degree plasma is a mean feat!) and not trivial to make.Not to mention that these things just make electricity - there isn’t anything magic about it.
