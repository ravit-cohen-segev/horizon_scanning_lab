One of the most repugnant aspects of war today is the conditioning and exploitation of child soldiers but in Star Wars, the Jedi are totally cool with manufacturing humans to force them into an army.If you could travel back to before the prequels were made and ask Star Wars fans to speculate on what “The Clone Wars” were like, I doubt you would find a single person who would guess that the Jedi were leading armies of clones. The thought is just too inherently evil. I wouldn’t believe you for a second if you tried to tell me that was what Lucas had in mind all along.So how did it end that way? I think it is because when good old George decided to finally make the prequels, he wanted amazing action scenes. He wanted his Jedi to be really cool. He wanted them to be taking on enormous odds and slicing through any obstacle before them. But at some point he realized he couldn’t have Jedi cutting through dozens of people - limbs and heads flying about in a cavalcade of gore. That just wouldn’t work.Imagine the scenes of Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon in Episode 1 where they cut through rooms full of droids if those were people instead of doofus robots. Arms flying, organs spilling out as bodies are cut into two or three pieces, Obi-Wan comically swinging his light saber like a baseball bat to send a blaster shot into the face of a human soldier - his head exploding in a pink puff. Not cool.But the Jedi could cut up droids by the thousands with no blood, no suffering, and no moral problems so in Episode 1 the kick-ass Jedi had to be fighting droids. But if droids were the bad guys, then come time to write Episode 2, the clones couldn’t be the bad guys too so Lucas put them on the Jedi’s team. And throughout his two last movies he never put a single line of dialog in where a Jedi questions the morality of manufacturing humans to be conscripted into an army and sent off to die.It’s interesting to note that when Timothy Zahn wrote the first Star Wars sequel novels, he included clones made using the Emperor’s old technology. They were used by the villains and the very presence of clones was enough to give the only Jedi (Luke) the willies. Those novels are of course not canon any longer but wouldn’t the Star Wars universe make a lot more sense if Lucas had realized, like Zahn and every other human in the world, that cloning soldiers is inherently evil and the Jedi would have no part of it?","1,914 followers",Brett Lissaman,2.7K,472,20M,2017,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-biggest-flaws-in-Star-Wars-films

Now that's an oxymoron right there. For a matter of fact the entire classification of the Jedi and the Sith is absolute too. Often the Jedi have believed that certain emotions makes one go to the Dark Side. But what we have come to know, and seen in many instances that there is light in dark and dark in light (very similar to Taoism). It's not exactly absolute light and dark, as the Jedi classified.E.g.Another very popular example of Jedi absolutism -“The quotation above is referring to the Sith Rule of Two. Only 2 Sith can exist in the galaxy. If the master dies, the apprentice becomes the master and finds a new apprentice. In case the apprentice dies, the master finds a new one. Generally this leads to a power struggle causing the apprentice to kill the master (similar to what Sidious did to Plagueis).But even this turns out to be a frivolous construct.

15,"It’s not cost.F-16 base unit cost is just shy of 30 million.A-10 Warthog … roughly $18 million.It’s not cost.F-16 base unit cost is just shy of 30 million.A-10 Warthog … roughly $18 million.Aside from that, the Israelis have put in an order to acquire F-35s and F-22s. Money is not a problem for the IDF,-It’s not because they’re vulnerable to modern anti-air systems.A-10s faced anti-aircraft weapon systems from the 70’s on up to the late 80’s at least, and anti-aircraft weapons all operate on the same principle. They explode with flak burst or uncoil metals to try and shred the target aircraft with debris. Updated systems might be more accurate, lighter, longer-ranged, cheaper, or fail a little less to chaff and flare, but deadliness hasn’t really been increased itself. In fact, it’s not legal to be increased; the Geneva Conventions (which Israelis ignore for the most part anyway) call for anti-aircraft systems to specifically be as non-lethal to the pilot as possible.The A-10 exploits this concept by making it so that even if the missile makes a direct hit (and it has happened many times) and explodes, the A-10 will still fly. It doesn’t matter what direction the missile or guns are coming from, enemy aircraft behind or SAMs below.An A-10 crashed in the first Desert Storm from, as I recall, attack from a fighter. It tried limping back to safety but the pilot couldn’t make it. The plane hit the ground at several hundreds miles per hour, cartwheeled 11 times, landed upside down, and skidded 300 meters. 75% of the aircraft was still salvageable. A-10s suffer almost nonexistent losses compared to other aircraft operated, especially in Kosovo, when Harriers were turned away, a stealth bomber was successfully hit, and others.No country on earth has an anti-aircraft weapon system that can reliably bring down the A-10.-It’s not because other aircraft do it better.The A-10 is not only cheaper than a most attack helicopters or AC-130, it will survive a lot better conditions if coming against other enemy aircraft than gunships could, while being virtually impossible to hit or come under threat by insurgent forces.At least in Yom Kippur, the A-4s that the Israelis try to use struggled to perform their Close Air Support duties and took tremendous casualties. I don’t know where people are getting the idea the A-4 Skyhawk was awesome at its job, it was not. In fact, the fact it did so poorly made Western military commanders consider the concept of CAS from something other than a gunship to be unnecessary, dangerous, and of limited use. But since then, the A-10 has had an extensive service life proving against far more advanced and updated A-A weapon systems since then.-So if these aren’t the reasons, what is?Israel is a tiny country that, while admittedly will need to be capable of crossing distances to fly over and take out enemy aircraft and hammer airfields en mass, otherwise prefers to fight in an extremely short-ranged, defensive manner.In the Yom Kippur War, Israel learned that its enemies were really wasteful and untrained with their advanced technology, and despite the extreme panic of sending out all their aircraft against a heavily numerical foe and taking 14% casualties to their force, their air power held together and prevailed in the end, establishing total air superiority dominance. She also learned that her artillery was an excellent thing to have, if accurate and vigilant, and that is what helped clear the way for the aircraft to support them later.Israel learned the extreme importance of having air superiority and is readily able to strike or disable airfields in advance. What Israel also learned was that it took a huge amount of training and luck to keep their struggling tank divisions intact and going.The Merkava helps solve all these problems. It’s range, mixed weapon capability, ability to cover most missions most armored vehicle would be needed for; it is astoundingly durable to the point direct hits from bombs won’t destroy it. It can go where the A-10 can go, without risk to A-A at all, travel a short distance, and bomb the necessary targets. They know they don’t need to buy A-10s to hammer enemy tank divisions when their cross coverage of multi-role jet aircraft help protect the Merkava from likewise being bombed.Why do your infantry need to call CAS from an A-10 or a gunship on a hard enemy target, wait for the aircraft to arrive on location or takeoff, when they have a Merkava next to them or nearby with advanced targeting systems capable of acting as mobile artillery?The expanse of space and military mission of the United States is different. The US plans on fighting most (hopefully all in theory) it’s wars overseas. It needs long-distance options and it can afford to specialize it’s military assets to a state of overkill effectiveness. This means that America can’t rely on slow-moving super tanks like the Merkava on an advanced take-and-hold mission over an enemy country like say Iraq or even North Korea.-Limited space",89 followers,Russell Harverson,1.1K,0,0,2019,https://www.quora.com/Why-doesnt-Daenerys-use-her-dragons-and-go-after-Euron%E2%80%99s-fleet

But it can only do a couple things really well against a well equipped enemy, and that is mainly close air support, and some moderate range interdiction.The A10 was actually intended to address situations (like what Israel faced in the 1973 War) as on the Syrian front, where the threat of massed armored attack was substantial. Not only does it carry remarkably heavy armaments, but it is well armored, and designed to maneuver through and survive intense localized, low level AA defenses.However, Israel can only afford a certain number of aircraft and those need to be multi-role. Even the A4 Skyhawk, which was very popular with the IAF, though nominally an attack jet, was a fast and nimble fighter which suited Israel’s needs very well.Israeli A4sIsrael dealt with the threat from Syria not only by counting on multi-role planes like the Skyhawk, Kfir, F-4 Phantom, F-16 and F-15, and with a variety of US attack helicopters (Defenders, Cobras and Apaches) but also a home grown ground defense system, the Tamuz (today known as the Spike) NLOS anti-tank missile system.Tamuz system.In the event, the need for either the A10 or Tamuz never really arose.

Hamas militants don't distinguish themselves from civilians, aA-10 Warthogs are great planes when the army you're attacking has no significant air defence and has targets for the Wharthog.Israel, on the other hand, has faced enemies with state of the art Russian air defence system, so the wharthog would be vulnerable and useless.

Buying and maintaining wharthogs instead of air defence countermeasures is simply a bad idea.Furthermore, the current war isn't really the type where you can carpet bomb the area. Hamas militants don't distinguish themselves from civilians, and now you have civilians carrying out attacks in the west bank. You can't really kill them with the GAU-8, it's too inefficient and produces too many civilian casualties.Thirdly, the wharthog is expensive. I forget the exact cost of using it, but I can guarantee you Israel doesn't have that money.Finally, Israel has to be precise. Drones and UAVs do a better job because they'reSo Israel really has no use for wharthogs.

21,The Israelis can’t afford to have their A-10s shot to shit all the time like American A-10s are in real conflicts. Better for their size Air Force to have high and fast fighters that can strike air to air or air to ground. The desert is optimized for tank warfare and the A-10s gun can’t take out modern tanks. F-16s or F-35s delivering high explosives is a much better option.The Israelis can’t afford to have their A-10s shot to shit all the time like American A-10s are in real conflicts.
