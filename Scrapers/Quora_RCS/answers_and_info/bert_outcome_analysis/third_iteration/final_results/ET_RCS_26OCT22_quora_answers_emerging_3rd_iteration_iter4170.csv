All taking a fraction of the energy they used to and with using such little amounts of energy also produces much smaller heat generation. When you use a smartphone hard and heat up that device you have know idea of what is actually going on inside and that little CPU is calculation trillions of bites of information to generate what you are seeing on that screen.

I was one of the people who is old enough to have learned the changed personally and was in electronics at the time this major change over came into existence. I love when modern tech work with old tubes, because when we had to no longer deal with tubes it was best day that came into existence.The next thing that transistors brought into the electronic world was miniaturization of components. This brought about the evolution of the computers and devices you see today. The next great thing that happened was integration in world of electronics between electrical science, physics, chemistry, and biological science. With that mixture today you have computers with SSD drives, Quantum Computers, smart phones, that are more powerful then Main Frames from 90s, full computers circuits on single chip, and tomorrow with invention of Quantum computing with computers the size of erase on pencil, brain cell replacements, true androids, and beyond our imaginations.If you really don’t think you will not see that in your lifetime believe me you have no idea. When I took typing class I was typing on actually typewriter and remember a typewriter repairman tell me that they were working on a typewriter that could spit ink onto the paper and form letter when you push a key. I never forgot this and I was told this in 1976 and never saw such a typewriter but in 1990s suddenly bubble jet printers came into existence where the printer actually spit ink onto paper. I suddenly remember that day in high school. I also in high school use to play with a computer. Now it was nothing to get excited about I sat in back room of the library with a keyboard and printer (I know now, then not sure what it was) and type in specs for dragster raced the computer. It was exciting you type in numbers and then computer told you if you win or lose and no graphics, just text saying you won, lost, or burned out. Today I see that computer I played in high school could not even be high school calculator today.Sorry for the rambling but this where we have come in my life at 62 and the computer was only 46 years ago. That sounds like a long time ago but I worked on machines in factory at one time that were being used before WWII and older.","220,621 followers",Franklin Veaux,588,47.3K,782.9M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-have-been-the-revolutionary-technological-changes-that-have-taken-place-to-permit-the-transition-from-the-original-large-computers-into-portable-laptops-tablets-and-other-handsets-such-as-smart-phones

I usually had flea bites all over my body. I never felt clean. We got clothes from Goodwill but they were usually old, faded, and stained. My mother did the best she could but we were all alone in the world. We lived in a rural area that was unforgiving of those who deviated from ""the norm."" My mother tried to baptize me when I was a baby, only to be turned away by the local preacher because I was ""a bastard."" We were not welcome in their churches, which were an important part of rural life there. I didn't have friends at school. I was ""weird"" ""dirty"" ""ugly"" ""too quiet"" etc. Even most of the teachers looked at me and my brother in disgust. We were ""the XXX family.""I grew up with the understanding that I was worthless. That I should be ashamed of who I am. I barely said a word through most of my childhood. I didn't say a word to anyone when they pushed me around, taunted me endlessly, beat up my brother and I. I never said a word when my neighbor (who, interestingly, was widely regarded as an outstanding member of society) raped me.I led a very solitary life. My mother was usually gone at work, my brother would devote himself to his own activities, and there I was. I remember I would sit outside of my home and pretend to be a rock, because rocks didn't feel anything and they certainly didn't cry. They were indestructible, I thought.I overheard one of the other little girls discussing the prayer they said before bedtime and I resolved to remember it. It went like this - As I lay down to sleep, I pray the Lord my soul to keep, if I shall die before I wake, I pray the Lord my soul to take.I thought about this prayer for the rest of the day, until I went home and decided on my own version: Dear God, I don't want to live anymore. There are other people begging you to keep them alive. Let me take their place. I'll die. I was about 8 years old.But I didn't die, much to my dismay. I woke up the next day, and the day after that, and the day after that. The days went by. My situation didn't greatly improve, people weren't much nicer to me, and my life didn't get easier. But I got stronger. I discovered books as a way to escape from my tedious existence and by the time I was in 5th grade, I was reading at a college level.I grew up and gained control over my life. I was no longer the defenseless, powerless victim I had been as a child. I had power. I could do whatever I wanted. I got a job. I studied hard so I could go to a good college. I escaped from my small, unforgiving town.I have a good job now and good relationships. People who know me now would never guess I was once that hungry, miserable, terrified, beaten down little girl I had been back then.As for my family, my mother still lives in that trailer. My neighbor is long dead. My older brother still lives with my mother. He has never gotten a driver's license or a job. He doesn't leave the house very often. A part of me understands his reluctance - why let the world do you more harm when it has already done so much? But I wish he would take the chance. I feel sad that our childhood all but destroyed him.If you want to know how to get through hard things, my answer is probably inadequate, but it is the best I have to offer.

Basically, it was a specific type of ice age when not only did the polar caps and glaciers around the world expand, but deserts did too, due to the atmosphere effectively having moisture sucked out of it by the ice.The atmosphere became very dry right across the world, but from our perspective, this affected significant parts of central, eastern and southeastern Africa where, at the time, all known humans lived. It’s estimated that the human population at this time could have dropped down to under 1,000 people.The second near-extinction event was around 70,000 years ago following the eruption of a Sumatran volcano called Toba. Rather, it wasn’t just an eruption but it was a super-eruption, where so much ash and gasses are thrown into the atmosphere that their environmental effects threaten life.It’s estimated that the Toba super-eruption ejected roughly 10,000 times more ash and gas than the 1980 Mount St. Helens eruption did and was big enough to significantly dim the sun globally for up to 6 years, resulting in worldwide cooling and a massive dying of vegetation from both cold and poor light. This again brought the human population down, perhaps to somewhere between 1,000 and 5,000 people.This was also the time that early humans began their migration out of Africa and around the world, it’s believed because once the ecosystem had stabilised following the eruption a ‘green corridor’ right the way up the east side of Africa and along the Nile Valley opened up, enabling our ancient ancestors to cross what had formerly been an impassable desert.","1,096 followers",Kyle Hayashi,6.2K,1.2K,4.3M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Aside-from-revolutionary-technological-innovations-such-as-the-Internet-boom-of-the-mid-late-90s-what-driving-forces-can-stave-off-an-economic-recession

Strange bruises appeared on her legs, and she felt off most of the time. A trip to urgent care led to a trip to the ER, which led to a trip to see an oncologist at the hospital in the big city near us. She had leukemia.Treatment started immediately, and we had no way of knowing what would happen. I prepared myself for the worst while trying to be strong for her. I could do it most of the time. After two weeks in the hospital she came home, and we started our new life that revolved around managing a disease that she still deals with to this day.Cancer wasn’t the hardest thing to overcome.Months later, I walked in on my wife’s boss shouting at her about how bad of a job she was doing. He knew she was getting used to being a sick person, and he wasn’t clear about his expectations for her, so he took out his frustration on her all at once. She was in tears, and I removed her from the situation as quickly as I could. That night we decided to move. It didn’t matter where as long as she didn’t have to work for that man anymore.I frantically began job searching, getting a handful of interviews and not feeling right about any of them. Out of the blue I got a call from my old boss who wanted me to come back and work full time for him in the same town where my family lived. He said “Bring your wife too, she can work here as well”. We cried tears of thanksgiving that we were going to be ok, and then we prepared to move our whole life to a new city and new jobs.Rapid change wasn’t the hardest thing to overcome.Three years and three babies later, we found ourselves in dire financial straits. Having children quickly was rewarding but incredibly stressful and busy, and our lives now revolved around them instead of my wife’s illness. In a way that was a blessing. It also meant we had very little money left after bills, and some months we had to borrow from friends to buy groceries.Both my parents and my wife’s parents had financial woes of their own, so we had to turn to friends often. The most humbling conversation I've ever had was asking friends for financial help, and feeling shameful about being in this position. Every single time our friends were more than willing to help. And every single time we were eventually able to pay them back, by the grace of God.Financial hardship still wasn’t the hardest thing to overcome.The hardest thing in life to overcome is despair. It is a crushing weight that can strangle the life out of your will to push through the troubles of life. Despair is the one thing that was always in the background for us through everything we dealt with, and it would have been easy to just give in and believe we would not make it through the trial. But we knew it was a lie, and kept believing that we would be ok.No matter what you’re dealing with, no matter how hard your life is, no matter how hopeless everything seems, do not fall into the lie of despair.***Edit: Wow, this is quite a response! I’m so glad our story is meaningful to other people, and thank you for all the kind words. We are blessed indeed.To answer a common question, my wife still has leukemia but she manages it with a daily medication. Aside from a couple of mild side effects she is healthy and feels good.

His wife sleeping beside him, he decided not to wake her up, convinced that everyone would be dead within half an hour anyway.A B-52,He received a call back shortly later, and was informed the number of incoming missiles had jumped to 2,200 — this was a full-scale annihilation. Brzezinski was determined that the USA should strike back, and so requested confirmation of preparations for retaliation. They were passed on, and ten aircraft from the Strategic Air Command were readied to launch into the sky and begin their flight towards the Iron Curtain, primed to deliver an American brand of retribution.As each second dragged on and with less than a minute from Brzezinski making the big call to the President, the one that would change the war from cold to searingly hot, he received a third call. He was informed that the other warning systems weren’t registering anything; radar and satellites showed no sign of any approaching missiles.
