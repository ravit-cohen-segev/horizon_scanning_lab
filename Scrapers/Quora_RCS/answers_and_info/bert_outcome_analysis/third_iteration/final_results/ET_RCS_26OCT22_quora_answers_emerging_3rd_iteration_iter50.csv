2,"Not to invest in penny stocks because almost all of the gurus who pitch them are scammers and you’re going to lose money. You probably think you’re special and will be an exception, but time will undoubtedly show you different.

There are only a few ways to actually make money with penny stocks and they are all spectacularly bad.I have the best ways to make money in penny stocks. There are only a few ways to actually make money with penny stocks and they are all spectacularly bad.Penny stocks behave more like lottery tickets than they do like regular stocks. Do you have any tips for buying lottery tickets? Just avoid them and stick to vanilla stocks.Penny stocks are what they are because the FAIL to meet the listing requirements of the major exchanges, that’s why they have to trade on the OTC/Pink Sheets - they are already failed companies! They might have poor management, a shitty product, accounting irregularities, or any other number of problems. The point is theyOnly under the rarest of circumstances does a penny stock actually transition back to a generally listed company. If you’re trying to get in on that before it happens, you won’t be asking about penny stocks plural, you’ll be in direct contact with the management team of the one company you believe in and asking them difficult questions.",6 followers,Ryan Burner,1.6K,0,0,2020,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-top-technology-penny-stocks-to-invest-in-2020

You can convince your friends that you do, but you can’t just convince the market. If you do want to gamble, open a gambling account. Don’t mix the two.Do you know for definite that the government of Botswana is going to issue the mining rights tomorrow? Or has that now been delayed? Has a drug patent been approved that you know about and the investing public doesn’t yet? You don’t? Hmm… Well, then maybe you’ll have to put in some hard work. You could start with a stock screener such as www.finviz.com - to learn about stocks. Have you figure out how to use it better than the others? You are competing, after all, with the smartest minds of the planet.“It’s the most intriguing game ever invented by man and it pays the biggest jackpot.”You bet they’re playing it!But wait! Don’t bet anything yet!Watch films like “The Margin Call” and others to learn about that business. What does the Jeremy Iron’s character say about either cheating or being first?There is another very good trading film - a doc about a silicon valley insider who secretly drops hints about big news in tech to her Wall Street friends in exchange for shopping vouchers. Do you have someone like that? Do you have a friend who’ll excuse himself, go to the toilet and text you that the merger is definitely going through? One who’s prepared to do time if caught doing so? Now, what was the name about that film...? She eventually figured out that the fancy dresses she was getting for the insider info was very far from proportionate reward for the benefit it was bringing to her friend, and started asking for more. And the FBI found it very hard to prove that she was passing privileged information illegally, which, of course, she was. They were onto her but traders talk about stocks all day and they had to catch her passing actionable inside knowledge. In other words, she was breaking the law in exchange for top label outfits. Only when she sat down in a cafe and saw the TV news about the insane profits her friends were making, did she realise that she could have asked for quite a lot more than a pair of stilettos. But the law was onto her by then. It’s all in one of those trading films.Ok, so you don’t have such a friend… Can you be first ahead of the crowd by some other means? Or, perhaps you are you prepared to cheat? Gamblers often do, you know.But before you start playing, buy shares in the firm that supplies your electric or gas. Put your lump sum into something really boring and really solid. Firms that own power stations, pipes, cables, the ones you have to buy from for your essential needs. You’re already their customer, like it or not. That’s not a bad business model. Start with that. Just put the money into utilities. Or, like others say - McDonalds - another one with a captive market. Lock that dividend - set it to keep re-investing. Your bank will set you up with a share account. In the future you may decide to diversify. But start with the energy firms. A friend of mine had an issue with his boiler. He bought shares in the firm and wrote a letter as a shareholder. In return he received a generous compensation. I saw him in the bookies showing the cheque to all his friends. He knew some guy who bout a small share in all the major firms that do annual meetings. This entitled him to attend shareholder meetings where he would get free tea and sandwiches. In nice and presentable City halls. Small of big, he still own a “piece” of the firm.If you still have any gambling money left over, then by all means open a trading account with a broker. And start learning about the market. In the USA I believe options is the best way to start gambling with small caps and such. Remember that options writers make the most money. Sometimes they do lose big so occasionally you can win big with options - if you are right on the time and the price. So look into options as a concept. Technically speaking, having an investment in an actual company where you own a tiny, tiny fraction of a boring regular business keeps you connected to reality.And - look! They’re doing quite well right now at this moment on whatever criteria. The power stations and the grids they own are not going to go out of fashion, don’t you think? They’re considered safe investments, but it’s still gambling on choosing one that won’t blow up in the morning. Mark Fisher says what do you care if it’s peruvian chickenshit. Others study the fundamentals. The beast called market is big and always ready to interact with you.",0 followers,Stock Price,878,0,0,2019,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-top-technology-penny-stocks-to-invest-in-2020
