We need to identify specific factors that are involved in order for to get to the intersecting parts. Meaning, we have to give a context to this question to avoid generalized and misleading response. Importantly, without data, there is no basis to answer the question objectively.Another reason why I think it is broad is the kind of issue were are dealing with. We can go from social science to natural science because communicating who should we vote as the next president and do vaccines work are two independent subject matters. In addition to that, we can combine these two disciplines if we ask why some people cannot accept vaccines. I hope you get the gist.Let us portray communication as a means to obtain an information. The data being transmitted, mediate or non-mediated, have its purpose. The closest discipline I have in mind where this question falls under is Agenda-setting Theory.

The more homogeneous a herd is, the less internal conflict. And conversely: any herd will always expunge and ostracize a different individual, and attack it if it differs too much from the norm of the herd.People with high IQ have different preferences, different priorities, different tastes and different interests than normies. This makes them different. What normies consider “awkward social skills” are simplyTo put it bluntly:If we set the average IQ of a human society as 100, we see that the vast majority of people (67% to be exact) fall within -1 and +1 standard deviations (84 to 116). Those form the bulk of humanity, and they have no problems on relating to each other. They live in the same world. The society plays by their rules. It is their social skillset which matters.When one’s IQ begins to deviate into either direction - upper or lower - differences and also discrepancies begin to appear. Those with deviation to lower side have it worse; their deviation from the normies’ ruleset is consideredBut once one’s IQ begins to deviate to the right side of the Gaussian curve, problems will emerge. The concept of theThe French have a saying:Those with IQ between one and two standard deviations above the average have an asset: theirs is higher than that of the normies, but not too much. They still fit in the norm of the herd. But the more one’s IQ deviates from the norm, the more his game differs from that of the normies.At the Mensa intake limit (2 standard deviations) the situation is not yet bad: approximately half of the society fall in their communication range. But the situation begins to exacerbate quickly; at the Triple Nine intake limit (three standard deviations), only 16% of the people in the society befall there.When one’s IQ increases, the following trends can be observed:These are not signs of bad social skills; they are signs of a different ruleset altogether. Of course most brainiacsI personally prefer to avoid the company of normies altogether.See",0 followers,Samuel Billings,9.1K,1.7K,2.2M,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-is-an-example-of-a-communication-range-issue-you-had-with-other-people-as-a-result-of-having-a-high-IQ

He was obviously extremely gifted from the few times we had conversations.

I have actually gotten this question a lot, which I even had explained in a post on my Kara Soylular’s Journal [ https://karasoylularsjournal.quora.com/ ] space…I want to explain to people once and for all, why I am spiritual and how IQ works.. It is something even some psychologists are not within an understanding of— especially ones who perpetuate things like MENSA and The High IQ Society, which hold validity within some regards, but in others, overlook of other components defining of one’s intelligence.Well, experience is a really crucial thing. I’ve had a lot of paranormal happenings that have made me a believer because I myself, have witnessed and experienced synchronicities amidst other things.. You if you’ve read my answers, may have even seen some of them, with evidence I have of, provided. Since many have a stigma when it comes to someone telling of their spiritual happenings, I tend to withhold about it, but I’m very open online about it, because I want to lessen the stigma. I also not having anywhere else to express myself, as the result of my familial situation and lack of friends, have no other place to be heard, and it is very healing for me and my childhood trauma to speak of it.If you were to in real life know me, unless I felt the vibe in my able to express my spirituality, would withhold it, and you’d think me to be a very intellectual, philosophical, and even, scientific person. Talking about my spirituality here, has helped me to stabilize in a way… I have taken the risk to be judged and seen as psychotic in speaking about my experiences.. With my diagnosis of BPD, people can already stigmatize me a lot.. They can say it is just wishful thinking and a means to cope. A means to survive my dire emotional pain… Some have even accused me of using my spirituality to escape accountability in getting better, which could be the furthest from truth. In that way, I have sacrificed myself, thrown myself out there like an object people can throw around and have opinions of. But that is sidetracking from my original point.Having a high IQ doesn’t make you a God or even, genius; it is one facet of intelligence, and only is representative of how quickly you can recognize patterns and logical reasoning. Merely, it is a manmade opinion of what constitutes intelligence. It is the fault of psychology for this. They have pushed the notion of such… Psychology just as much as it has helped humanity, has in many ways, done us harm, but that is not for a now in gettting into, aside for how it pertains to IQ. You have emotional intelligence, which is arguably “more important” in this current world because of how it’s set up, yet if it changes in its way, another form may paramount.There are high IQ Christians, atheists, and like me, spiritual people. It is like making the assumption only Caucasians get mental illness.. When it happens amidst every race. There are surgeons who are highly sensitive and empathic, and a few scientists, even.. A high IQ only representative of how quickly you can spot patterns and process something logically, does not define someone’s experiences, beliefs or the like, even if perhaps they can be influential of someone’s belief system.. If you are more rationally minded for instance, you may gravitate more towards research and facts, but if you experience something for yourself, it may alter.

8,"Since I am the one who has popularized the concept of communication range on Quora, perhaps I am the best to answer.TheThe communication range stems from two observations: firstSince I am the one who has popularized the concept of communication range on Quora, perhaps I am the best to answer.TheThe communication range stems from two observations: first that human beings thrive best in groups which are as homogeneous as possible, but especially intellectually homogeneous, and second that a leader must be more intelligent than his subordinates, but not too intelligent, because s/he is not understood anymore and the leader/subordinate bond fails.The communication range thus denotes the range of IQ within which all meaningful human interaction (friendships, marriages, organizations cohabitation, employment, hobbies, interests, any discourse deeper than a coffee cup) occurs. It does NOT mean that any communication over that 30 points’ gap was impossible; things like small talk, customer service, discussion over irrelevant matters, everyday communication, patient-doctor relations, client-service relations etc are perfectly possible over that 30 points’ range. But they are meaningless interaction - they do not carry meaningful things.The communication range isTo put it bluntly:When this communication range is exceeded, the human interaction breaks down. The lesser endowed feels like a moronic dullard and the more endowed like an incomprehensible nerd.Of course I can do small talk. Of course I can do customer service. Of course I can talk with people on the left half-plane of the Gaussian curve. Of course I can communicate with them and use language they understand. But that is not the point. The point isThings could be tolerable, but when the communication range gap is large enough, theTo put it bluntly:Marriages are happiest when the IQ of the spouses are as close to each other as possible. If they differ more than one standard deviation, divorce is likely. If they differ two, divorce is almost certain.The communication range is usually meaningless if your IQ is 135 or less. It is wide enough (105 to 165) to cover large enough part of the society not to impede life. According to Hollingworth, the “sweet spot” for IQ is between 120 to 135. But once your IQ is high enough - 136 or more - the communication range and all its negative effects will set in. And when your IQ is high enough, it will be certainly skewed. You will find extremely hard to find friends, peers, spouse, romantic relationship - any meaningful human relationships.This is also the reason why prisons, militaries, boarding schools and asylums are the snake pits they are. When you lock up people with vastly diverse IQs and backgrounds together, internal conflicts are certain to arise. But this is also the reason why I absolutely loved the military academy albeit it was just as a totalitarian institution as the boot camp: we all cadets were on each other’s communication ranges and could well relate to each other.It is a public secretErnest Hemingway once said “The trick is to find your own tribe. A group of people where the average IQ is within your communication range. I have two; sailors and skydivers. Finding your own tribe may be hard but it certainly is worth it. It is no use to waste your time and energy on pondering what is wrong with you and in desperate attempts to get along with the normies - the only thing you will get is pimples from sheer frustration.So if you ponder why you are so intelligent and so lonely and if there is something wrong with your social skills, the answer is thatThe high IQ societies, like Mensa, Triple Nine, Prometheus etc will work best as peer support groups for people with very high IQ. Meeting peers will ameliorate the loneliness and provide opportunities to meet similar people and socialize with them.See also:The Outsiders | Grady M.

It’s more of an ignorantly misguided confidence, mixed with a totally deluded sense of grandiosity.He has an uncanny ghoulish way of getting away with things he knows very little about, (and that’s pretty much everything). It is not so much that he backs himself to outsmart his challenges, (obviously he’s incapable of doing that)… it’s more that he considers himself to be above even having to be answerable in the first place.(Edit: Somebody in the comments said, Despite who’s inside, Trump has the weird ability to suck the intelligence out of a room… lol... too funny… but funny as it is, unbelievably, it does seem to be exactly what happens.)He takes no responsibility for anything whatsoever…And when even slightly challenged, he will attack like a spoilt little baby, and will blame anybody and everybody in sight. He does this literally by name calling, and lying through the skin of his teeth.This tact is so outrageous, so preposterous… it’s simply astounding he gets away with it. But what’s even more ridiculous, is he actually believes this childish strategy to be something genius.In reality all he really does is make a fool of himself and a mockery of his own “undeserved” privilege.Unfortunately and rather bizarrely it seems, at least 40% of Americans were either fooled by his narcissistic bravado, or are themselves actual morons.I’m sorry… but from an internationally civilized perspective, this is truly shocking! It reflects something about the good old US of A, that the remaining 60% of Americans find rather, well… embarrassing.Actually to be perfectly fair, Mr Trump’s true clown trousers weren’t totally axiomatic till later on in his term. I mean nobody ever expected the levels of idiocy he is reaching on a daily basis right now. Nobody…Even those of us who were shocked from the beginning, are surprised by just how absurdly idiotic he is proving to be.I mean come on… the man is a total doucheburger.He’s* obtusely offensive,Hell… he doesn’t even read his briefs for goodness sake. What kind of president doesn’t freaking read?President Trump often struggles to focus during his intelligence briefings, and frequently ignores information he disagrees with.You can’t correct him (let alone reason with him) because he thinks he knows more about everything than anybody else, including experts on all manner of topics.Trump always thinks he’s the smartest person in the room. What a freaking joke… Only in his big bloated orange egomaniac head.He can barely string enough words together to form coherent sentences, and they’re often just flippant remarks based on petty nonsense.He says the most ludicrous things (as if they are supposed to mean something), despite being nothing but scatterbrained trumpery (pun intended). How he can not see how stupid he looks is just plain cringe worthy.He’s a freaking comedy show! That’s what he actually is. He’s damned entertaining… but “sorry mate”, we are laughing at you, and your weird whiny querulous lies, not with you.We don’t think you’re clever funny, we think you’re dumb-ass funny.Alarmingly…the comedy Trump provides for us, overshadows the increasing seriousness of the real danger he incites.The level of “crazy” that Trump gets away with is disturbingly shameful…I’d even be bold enough (and I’m not the only one I’m sure) to say,it’s a national disgrace.I’m not going to get into the nitty-gritty of all that right now, but it’s concerning to say the least. And when I say concerning, I pretty much mean dangerous. Not just for America either,Trump being president is dangerous for all of us, the whole freaking world.So there we have it, my two cents as somebody from outside of the USA.

The IQ is a great enabler, and it unfortunately also enables to experience unhappiness in much deeper and profound way than anyone with mediocre IQ would.Homo sapiensAnd overtly high IQ is the most certain way to get excluded and ousted. The reason is theThe concept of communication range was established by Leta Hollingworth. It is +/- 2 standard deviations (roughly 30 points) up or down on one’s own IQ. It denotes the range where meaningful interaction (communication, discussion, conversation and socializing) is possible. If the IQ difference between two persons is more than 30 points, the communication breaks up. The higher IQ person will look like an incomprehensible nerd and the lower IQ as a moronic dullard - and they will not find anything common.+/- 30 points does not sound much, but once the IQ is past 135, the downsides are imminent. When someone has a perfectly mediocre IQ (100 for Caucasian average), his communication range is from IQ 70 to IQ 130, which covers some 98% of the whole population. But when it is 135, it is from 105 to 165, which is approximately 36% of population. And it gets worse: if it is 162,And it gets worse.When the average IQ of a group is lower than the lower end of your communication range, the group will see you as a hostile outsider. They will do anything to bully you out of their presence. They will ostracize, excommunicate and oust you amongst themselves.Sorry, butYou may say that nobody must left behind and that mobbing and bullying is nasty and unacceptable, but our biology dictates otherwise. Exclusion is the basis for co-operation. A group which does not exclude people differing from the norm off or otherwise eliminate their presence, becomes dysfunctional.Let me put this bluntly:And this issue - that unhappiness is due to loneliness and the loneliness is due to the communication range - isThe secret for happiness is to find your own tribeOnce you have found your own tribe, the unhappiness and misery will lift off. You will experience something which comes naturally to the mediocrities. You may even find meaningful human relations, friends and even wife or husband there. It is no secret many skydivers are either single - or married to each other.Let me illustrate this with a personal example.I have volunteered in the Finnish military. The Finnish military is based on universal male conscription, while females may volunteer. Since all able-bodied men are bound to serve on pain of prison, the cohort really is an intersection of the whole society.If we discount us girls (we slept in a separate lodge but trained with boys) the boot camp consisted of conscripted boys. The average IQ of Finns is 99 (Vanhanen & Lynn et al). It was very much an intersection of boys born on one certain year. Our company consisted of some 160 boys, of which 15 were washed out during the boot camp. This would predict there were 4 boys (and me) whose lower limit of communication range IQ was over the average, and 4 whose upper limit IQ was below it. Needless to say, all but one of the low end boys were washed out. But those with top high IQ had real difficulties on fitting in - as did I have. I won’t go to details but let’s say there were conflicts.Once the boot camp were over and we were officially Privates, the selection for special training was made. I was assigned to a technical and demanding branch, where the average IQ was almost one standard deviation higher than in the boot camp. Now if the boot camp had felt like a prison or concentration camp, the specialist training was more akin to comprehensive school. I found it much easier to fit in and my motivation to serve returned.When an opportunity to apply for officer training opened, I thought it would provide me a way to climb a couple of rungs on the military ladder from the bottom of the food chain. To my surprise I was approved. The training was hard and tough - the boot camp had been only a mild prelude compared to what we cadets had to endure - but we all were volunteers, and the average IQ of military engineering cadets was close to 130. From the first day on I felt I am now amongst my own. I liked each and every minute of it. While the training was straight from Hell, I can still remember the team spirit and the unity we experienced. It was like being in a boarding school, like Eton or Harrow. We formed life-long friendships.Unfortunately, I failed as an officer. My IQ at the lower end of my communication range was higher than the average of the privates - they saw me as an incomprehensible nerd and would not accept me as their leader. So I resigned and went for academia.It is a cliche to say “all high IQ people are generally unhappy”. No, they aren’t. IQ is a great enabler, nothing more.

14,"I was extremely gifted in English and music and at the age of 7 I was sitting with final year students, discussing Shakespeare's tragedies. I loved practising piano and did so before and after classes and all day Saturdays-(the nuns would provide me with lunch) and I'd be there until 6pm. I was hopeless at sport and wanted to read all the time and I was universally disliked at school. This has left me with an antipathy for children until this day.I was extremely gifted in English and music and at the age of 7 I was sitting with final year students, discussing Shakespeare's tragedies.
