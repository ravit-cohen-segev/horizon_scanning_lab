At a distance of 1 AU from the Sun (Earth's orbit), an object can be up to 150 C on its light side and as low as -150 C on its dark side.  The Sun coats everything at that distance with about 1400 watts per square meter.And the Sun isn't the only concern.  Any equipment that uses electrical power is generating heat.  That heat needs to be dumped and radiation is a poor heat transfer mechanism for doing that.Thermal control for spacecraft is quite complex - it's a constant battle to keep the spacecraftThere is a misunderstanding at the heart of this question - that objects in space are cold.

That heat needs to be dumped and radiation is a poor heat transfer mechanism for doing that.Thermal control for spacecraft is quite complex - it's a constant battle to keep the spacecraft within its operational range.  On the ISS, for example, there are vast radiators that reject heat to space and through those radiators and all along the truss flow pipes of ammonia and inside the vehicle flow pipes of cold water, around each module and through cold plates that are attached to each computer or other heat generating mechanism.  When a pump fails, we have to start unpowering those computers and equipment to prevent massive overheating of the ISS.So, if we put superconducting servers in space, we are going to have to surround them with thermal control systems.And we haven't even begun to discuss the complications of operating computers in the high radiation environment of space.  Computers require hardening to survive long in space.","220,643 followers",Franklin Veaux,2.9K,47.3K,783.1M,2014,https://www.quora.com/Could-one-operate-superconducting-computers-from-space

I could not write more than 10 answers in Tamil Quora.But I am able to write more than hundred answers in Telugu Quora. I feel Telugu is like a twin language of Kannada.Sentence formation, pronunciation in Telugu is like Kannada. Grammar is bit different when it comes to gender usage, else it has great resemblance with Kannada.Script is 90% similar to Kannada.For me learning a language means to speak, understand, read and write in it.When all the above four are considered Telugu is very close to Kannada.Tamil pronunciation is different from Kannada, presence of half ‘u’, consonant ending words are not there in Kannada, where as Telugu is vowel ending just like Kannada.I know many won’t agree to this and say Kannada and Tamil are from south Dravidian, where as Telugu is from south Central Dravidian language family, hence Kannada and Tamil are closer than Kannada and Telugu.But, for me, learning Telugu is comparatively easier than learning Tamil.",1 follower,Chris Nash,793,5K,30.7M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Could-one-operate-superconducting-computers-from-space
2,"For whom?For speakers of other Dravidian languages (Tamil, Kannada, Malayalam)? It won’t be that hard because there are many similar words in all of the aforementioned languages, general structure is similar and along with other factors, it would be much easier to learn it.For speakers of Indo-European, Finno-Ugric languages, isolates such as Korean and Basque, it would be significantly harder.So it really depends on your mothertongue - if there are some features that are shared with Dravidian languages, it might be easier to grasp the rules, but it doesn’t mean that learning would be easier.",30 followers,Vijaya Lakshmi,907,1.2K,43.4M,2017,https://www.quora.com/Which-is-the-best-tool-to-learn-typing-in-Telugu-in-Ubuntu-15-10

Maybe some of you know these tricks, but if you don’t know them, I assure: they will really save you thousands of hours of life!1- How to instantly open a randomly closed tab?Unfortunately, this happens often: wanted to close a window in the browser but accidentally closed other important windows as well.Instead of looking for it in history, use these ""short-cuts"" to compensate your inattention:For Windows:For Mac:2- What if the boss/Papa/Mama crept in from behind?Sometimes you feel lazy at work and start reading random stuff on Quora. And you have a dozen other windows opened.How to quickly pretend that you are working?These shorts quickly remove the browser windows by minimising all and showing the desktop(in windows) and you can return to the Word or Excel screen (manually):For Windows:For Mac:3- How to lock the computer, if you need to leave for a while?No one likes his boss to read his chat conversations or you do not want anyone to look into your monitor, until you leave to make coffee.Others will not able to open only if you have set a password to login. One can simply enter by clicking your user icon if you dont have a password.This quick combination of keys will instantly lock your computer and you will be able to fully enjoy the break:For Windows:For Mac:4- What if the computer halts?It happens that you are sitting in Photoshop, and all of a sudden - the entire computer is “hung”. And it does not react to anything.Typically, users immediately press Ctrl + Alt + Del to reboot.

But it happens that there are too many things on the screen, and it is long and tedious to crop the picture.Here's how to always allocate only what you need:For Windows:-Alt + Print Screen(the screenshot is saved to a folder called “Screenshots” in Pictures folder)For Mac:I think for now, it’s enough.
