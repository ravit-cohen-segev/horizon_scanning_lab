I assume that you do not mean miraculously immortal, i.e. capable of surviving a direct hit from a bomb, or a fall from a great height, or poisoning with Pu238, &c.Under these circumstances, people will still die, by accident, suicide, or murder. Effectively, the human lifespan would be replaced with a half-life, whose numerical value would have to be determined by actuaries. Babies would still be born. Despite the OP asking that all the other issues be ignored, really they can’t be. A plummeting death rate has to be matched by an equally plummeting birth rate if disaster, as a direct consequence of the laws of physics, is to be avoided.An efficient brain-repair system would imply a permanent capacity for rapid learning, as in childhood. Consequently, some people would become very knowledgeable in technological fields, so there should be technological progress, assuming there was funding to support the research. I suspect the direction would alter somewhat: more pure-science-driven projects, i.e. big telescopes, artificial life, extinction reversal, habitat construction, &c, and less consumer tech aimed at a young-adult market.A very long life would lead to boredom in those who could not find something to keep their mind occupied. I think suicide might become very prevalent, especially in the first cohort to be raised into immortality, because their education would not have prepared them for an indefinitely long life. There would be a severe Darwinian cull of people unable to cope: drink, drugs, fast cars, and dangerous sports including gladiatorial combat, would probably do for many.Under these circumstances, I myself would look for a few more ancient languages to study, e.g. Pharaonic Egyptian, Sumero-Akkadian, & Sanskrit, also I would want to bring my mathematics at least up to first-year university level.",UNKNOWN,Devin O'Keefe,21.8K,0,0,2020,https://www.quora.com/If-people-became-immortal-tomorrow-ignoring-all-the-other-issue-it-has-do-you-think-technology-will-develop-Or-will-the-fact-that-people-are-stuck-in-their-ways-forever-mean-that-the-development-of-technology-would

You cannot click any of the buttons or interact with the forms.Leo, the Web Designer, sends this image file to the Front End Developer, John.Now, John writes code that builds a real page that looks just like the one in the image.At this stage, the page has a form that can be submitted, but if a user tries to submit the form, the data goes nowhere.This is where Dave, the Back-End Developer, comes in. He writes some magical code that handles all the data that comes from the user when she submits the form.Dave's code validates the data for errors like invalid email, empty password field, etc.If Dave's code finds no validation errors in the data, the data is stored in the database.Now, the user is able to login to the website.The same process is followed for every page of a website.I hope this answer helped.

New technologies keep popping (AngularJS, Angular 2/4, ReactJS, React Native, Ionic 1, Ionic 2, ExtJS, EmberJS, BackboneJS, VueJS etcetera), and although there are a few leading technologies and stacks that are good to stick to, everything is still “foggy” for the front-end developers.In 2017, front-end codebases contain a massive amount of business logic and handles many aspects that were previously handled in the back-end. Due to recent technologies (ES2015, TypeScript for example), front-end code became literally as complex as the typical Java/C#/C++ code, from an architectural point of view.Most importantly - front-end developers need to be autodidacts. They must keep up with the new advancements. Sleepwalk for a year, and you’re completely lost in Front-end Land. Staying a back-end developer today is very comfortable.

Keeping in mind their pros and cons, they will keep on coming and going. For example, NodeJs is fantastic when it comes to real time data processing, but fails miserably with write processes. To overcome it's cons, a new framework came in the market (Deno) which is built by the same guy who built node. Similarly for java, spring boot is the current trend but play has a lot features to support along side akka. So, it's all about what is the market trend and whether the framework itself is able to keep up with them or not.Considering today's requirements, you can blindly trust on NodeJs and spring boot. They are not going anywhere atleast in upcoming 4 5 years. For future you can keep an eye on deno for javascript and akka for java.",492 followers,George Mauer,1.4K,100,1.9M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Which-developments-in-technology-will-transform-the-way-we-drive-cars

There are some good prospects in mobile but, while every company has a website, not every company has an app so your job market is somewhat more narrow.Backend is a grind. I’m not quite sure what’s wrong with backend. Java has been around forever and Go/golang and specialized Java like Akka hasn’t seemed to take off. Practically everybody seems to know Java so it feels like there are too many Java devs. It seems hard to distinguish yourself or stand out in the backend. It seems like companies are trying to solve backend issues with quantity rather than quality.Full stack is having trouble making its case. Employers can view full stack engineers as the best of both worlds or the worst of both worlds. In the very best case, you get extra pay for being a front end “super expert”: you get a premium for being a front end expert + a premium on top of that for having backend skills. If not, you might get paid as a front end expert. But, in the other cases, you might be seen and paid as a “jack of all trades, master of none” or simply an unspecialized engineer.If you choose front end, I encourage you to use your private time to learn backend (so you can be full stack) and then market yourself as whatever pays the best at the time. Additional benefits of full stack are being able to do your own startup as a one-man band and having a broader understanding of technology.","50,711 followers",Håkon Hapnes Strand,621,4.4K,85.9M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Which-developments-in-technology-will-transform-the-way-we-drive-cars

The effect these technologies will have on life extension differs greatly but my guess is that there are two potential approaches which are likely to come to fruition first, number one is SENS which is biotechnology and as I see it potentially likely to reach the implementation stage within perhaps 10 years but not more that 25, the other is a combination of robust artificial intelligence and nanotechnology combined with whole brain emulation which is likely 30 to 50 years away. Whole brain emulation is where the brain is uploaded to a digital medium and increasingly enhanced and replaced with non-biological components until it reaches a stage where the non-biological components can model the biological part so accurately the original brains loss would be irrelevant from a functional perspective.Personally, I feel the outcome long term will ultimately be a combination of the five technologies, the crucial point is that each of these technologies individually has the potential to get us to where we need to go. What this means is that for the development of radical life extension to fail all of these technologies must also fail and that simply won’t happen, hence my guess is we will reach the stage of having a decisive level of control over the aging process within 15/20 years.

However, these are by no means in place as yet, but here are a few promising technologies that will probably pave the way in any case.Stem cell technology will likely allow us to live longer than we ever thought possible, as we figure out how to constantly repair or regenerate our bodies in the way they would naturally, if our supply of healthy stem cells never ran out. On top of this, healthy new stem cells will allow us to 3d print our own replacement organs in the very near future.Certain proteins may also allow us to considerably extend our lives, beyond what’s mortally possible right now. There’s expanding research into this topic right now, with certain products already on the market — though not a ton of research into how long they’ll allow us to live.Nanotechnology is also a promising field, that may help us eliminate degenerative diseases and allow us to live considerably longer. Whether we discover a way to let these future miracle workers extend our lives indefinitely is a long way off (if at all possible), though I’m looking forward to seeing where the research goes.","90,434 followers",Lukas Schwekendiek,799,3.6K,77.3M,2019,https://www.quora.com/Which-developments-in-technology-will-transform-the-way-we-drive-cars
