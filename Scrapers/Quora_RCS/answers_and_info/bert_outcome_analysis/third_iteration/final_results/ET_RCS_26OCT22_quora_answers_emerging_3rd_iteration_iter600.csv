Next thing you know, a factory is producing the exact same product, only this one is slightly off in some way. It could be the name, the logo, anything about it, but is functionally the same product. These are then sold to a consumer base that hasn’t been exposed to the original but for a short time before the knock-offs appear, which means that to the average Chinese citizen, it’s the same thing.Below are a few examples of what I’m talking about.

China’s economy has grown very fast in the last 4 decades and has become the world's largest trading country.Reduce coal consumptionTo grow and expand production capacity, China has increased energy consumption.

It has committed to building a greener China. China’s economy has grown very fast in the last 4 decades and has become the world's largest trading country.Reduce coal consumptionTo grow and expand production capacity, China has increased energy consumption. Coal is a necessary energy source for China in the process of development and trade. It is the main energy source and an important industrial raw material for China. The coal industry has a fundamental role in China's industry to ensure that coal remains the cornerstone of China's energy security and is the most economical and safe energy source that can be used cleanly and efficiently.China has mede concrete move to reduce coal consumption. In recent years, China's share of coal consumption has been at a level below 60%, and the share of coal consumption has dropped to below 56% in 2021. Achieving carbon neutrality cannot simply be interpreted as reducing the share of fossil energy use (de-coalization).Rational utility of coalThe key to the future development of carbon neutrality is to carry out comprehensive technological innovation in ""less carbon"", ""carbon use"" and ""no carbon"" emissions, and to vigorously develop new principles and technologies to achieve carbon neutrality. With this scenario in mind, the main way of using coal is power generation in a more clean and more efficient way. Also, the main way of using renewable energy is also power generation. The optimal combination of coal-fired power generation and renewable energy power generation can make full use of the stability of coal-fired power generation, provide a base for renewable energy to smooth out fluctuations, and circumvent the instability of renewable energy power generation.The carbon neutrality target has forced the coal industry to change the path-continuity innovation model of import-digest-absorb-re-innovation in the past decades. China's coal industry is putting down the burden of crude development of production growth, returns to a reasonable scale, takes the road of scientific production capacity, and takes its own road of high-quality development. It pays more attention to the whole process of coal production, processing, storage and transportation, safe, green, low-carbon, and economic consumption, and rapidly improves the quality of development. The coal industry will completely overturn the traditional image, achieve high-quality development, and become a high-tech industry.Develop renewable energyTo achieve carbon neutrality, China needs to push forward the green development agenda and develop renewable energy. The coal industry also suffers from mismatched standards and norms, unsound regulatory requirements, insufficient ability to cope with climate transition risks, and inadequate technology research and development, which requires further governance by the Chinese government. In the future, with the development of electric power technology, the improvement of grid facilities, and the popularity of electric vehicles, most of China's energy consumption will come from electricity rather than fossil energy. The main destination of minerals such as coal, oil and natural gas has changed from burning to provide electricity and power to raw materials, to provide chemicals such as rubber and plastic, and this part of energy use will only cause little carbon emissions in a longer time frame.",UNKNOWN,Bill Yu Liao (廖彧),650,138,1.9M,2022,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-top-green-technology-companies-in-China

However, there is no best, only best fit, and from this perspective off-the-shelf software products are sometimes better suited to your business needs.Custom software refers to software made especially for your business, designed around your specific objectives and made to match your preferred ways of working. Off-the-shelf software is a generic product, where you choose a solution with features you feel will segue with your business.While I don’t know the particulars of your company I can explain which business scenarios typically suit custom-made software, versus off-the-shelf solutions.Benefits of custom-made softwareDesigned around your business: Off-the-shelf software is defined by what is useful to the most people, rather than what is the most useful to you. Custom software’s big differentiator is that it is specifically created to suit your business - your business goals, your company org structure, and your business processes. This means your teams won’t have to create complicated workarounds to incorporate the software - it will easily fit around them.Your exclusive property: Bespoke software will be unique to your company. For some businesses, this can deliver a critical competitive advantage by delivering better insights or allowing them to be more reactive. Off-the-shelf software is a generic product all your competitors can own - and many will. This can make it hard for businesses to distinguish themselves in a crowded marketplace.Build and modify into the future: Do you know where your business focus will be in 10 years? Custom software allows developers to improve and change into the future, enabling businesses to pivot when required. Off-the-shelf software doesn’t have this baked-in agility - there are certain functionalities and these are set by the maker.Benefits off-the-shelf softwareOut-of-the-box functionality: Off-the-shelf software can be used from the day of purchase, circumventing the lengthy development times that custom software development can entail. For smaller businesses particularly this can be tempting, as it helps them move ahead quicker.Pricing: Custom software development will always be more expensive than off-the-shelf software. Again, a lower price tag can be a deal-breaker for smaller businesses. In addition, off-the-shelf software often offer more flexible pricing options, such as monthly subscriptions, which make them easier for the finance team to afford.Generic requirements: Not all digital solutions are world-beating innovations; sometimes HR just wants to log holidays. For generic, simple software needs, off-the-shelf software can be a quick, cheap and easy way to get those days off listed.Purchasing software is a huge decision and not to be undertaken lightly. At the end of the day, if you’re unsure the best thing to do is speak to a software company for simpler projects, or engage the services of an IT consultancy for larger projects. They will be best placed to advise you as to what products are out there, and whether your business needs merit a bespoke solution.For more information, see our blog",54 followers,Gordon Clark,2.3K,0,0,2021,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-top-green-technology-companies-in-China

Tesla had technical problems with finding a suitable two-speed transmission, and eventually went for a fixed 8.27:1 transmission.The problem with single-speed transmissions is that top speed must trade off with acceleration. Since 0-60mph acceleration and 1/4mile times are so important to the automotive press, and very few drivers ever exceed 125 mph anyway, the better design choice was to opt for acceleration over top speed.",21 followers,Geoffrey Thorndyke,683,8.3K,48.4M,2013,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-top-green-technology-companies-in-China

It worked by over riding the crank sensor and following a calculated curve. So it lost traction over a bump and the engine would start to spin up but the calculated curve would fire at the time and the engine would lose power due to the ignition being retarded.In use it allowed that team to effortlessly pass a car out if a slow bumpy corner.Tesla goes further by tuning the traction on the fly. If best performance is at say 3% wheel spin the motor speed will be set at 3.1% spin and the power at 2.9% spin. If it hits 3.1% it cuts power and at 2.9% it adds power.IC cars don't have that ability to micro manage traction.An edit about traction and how it works.

Changing email addressesAs funny as it sounded at the time, the email address TurdyMcTurdles@lamemail.com looks bad on a CV. The trouble is, it's easier to actually move house than it is to change email addresses and maintain all of your correspondences.Updating every online account you have takes forever, as does safeguarding all of your files and making sure everyone who emails you has access to the new address. The reality is, you're never free of an old email address. There's always the temptation to login every couple of months just to ensure you've not missed something important, like a message from a long-lost friend, or bank telling you you've been defrauded. How else do you think Hotmail was able to keep going for so long?3. Proper all-day smartphone battery lifeThe other day, in trying to solve the conundrum regarding iOS 7 and crippled iPhone 5 battery efficiency we stumbled across a really helpful online feature. ""Just try using it less,"" it advised. Geniuses! Why didn't we think of that?However, even without a new OS to sap the cell, the full HD 5-inch screens, quad-core processors, console-quality games and turn-by-turn GPS mean most well-used handsets are begging for a refill after a tough 8-hour shift. Is it really that hard to make them better? We've still got a Nokia 3210 in the office that's been switched on since 1999.4. Pick 'n' Mix televisionIsn't ludicrous that in 2013, with omnipresent streaming portals and on-demand options that simply obtaining our favorite TV channels necessitates paying for about 500 that we don't want?""Need Sky Sports, Sir? Here's the Bio channel too! Here you can watch Real Housewives of Atlanta re-runs all day."" Thanks! Sadly, this isn't technology's problem, but that of an antiquated subscription model that current technology will eventually crush to smithereens. However, we won't get there until an entire generation of Rupert Murdochs shuffle off this mortal coil.5. A-zombie FlashThis weekend will probably see the bulk of the Halloween celebrations and we're pretty proud of our costume this year. It's a cracker! We're going as Adobe Flash, because no matter how hard the world tries, it just won't die.The Michael Myers of web technology was savaged by Steve Jobs, banned from iOS and hell, even Adobe doesn't like it that much anymore. The real reason flash still hangs around crashing our computers, gobbling up our RAM and forcing us into updates at every turn and inhibiting our mobile experiences is because of HMTL5 has failed to assume the throne. We're not angry, we're just disappointed.6. Wi-Fi on the railsNow, we wouldn't mind so much if it were free, but when you're spending a lot of money for a couple of hours Wi-Fi to ease the passage home, the least you can expect is for it to work more than 3% of the time. Unfortunately, it doesn't.Thankfully, that could be about to change. In September plans were unveiled for 'high speed mobile broadband' on UK train lines. As a result, 70% of rail customers will get access to a network that'll even allow streaming video and music. Great! Only problem is we have to wait until 2019 (which probably means 2025 really, doesn't it?).7. Screen upNo disrespect to the display manufacturers who do fine work protecting our mobiles from scrapes and crashes. We're pretty sure we'd come off worse in a scrap with a sheet of Gorilla Glass. Unfortunately, when it comes the timeless battle between smartphone and this fair earth, the unforgiving floor has earned its fair share of triumphs.How many people are still walking around with smashed that look like they've annoyed an AK-47? Samsung and LG are pioneering unbreakable flexible displays, but we've been hearing about them for years with a new demo at CES every year. Where are they exactly?8. 'Totally amazing excellent discovery... NOT!'Have you ever found Spotify's 'Hey, you listened to this band, here's another very similar band you probably already listen to' Discover tab useful?No, us neither. Indeed, despite encompassing most of the popular music ever recorded, streaming services, with their complex algorithms and reams of data on our listening habits, still haven't cracked the code for furnishing us with completely new music particular to our tastes, in the way a magazine or a chat down the pub with a likeminded mate can. Spotify, we like you, but you are not a like-minded mate.9. Cloudy with a chance of tsunamiWe live in the most advanced technological age ever right? So how come the most efficient way of judging the day's weather prospects is still opening the curtains, looking out of the window, making a clothing decision and hoping for the best?Indeed, there's probably never been a more inexact science than meteorology, but the Met Office, which actually powers the BBC's weather seems to be taking the guesswork to a whole new level. You're getting this information from space remember guys, step it up!10. Commercial Supersonic FlightWouldn't it be awesome if we could fly from London to New York in under 3 hours? In effect, getting from LHR to JFK a couple of hours before we left? Yes, it might be an unrealistic pipedream... wait a sec... weA tragic accident in 2000, the effect of the 9/11 attacks and spiralling maintenance costs did for Concorde, but why hasn't something been done since to reinstate supersonic flight?

I'm a very ordinary soul, living a very simple life. I never craved for making money in life. I was adjusted to the normal lifestyle.I never used to become jealous of anybody's wealth or dress. I used to prefer peace over money.People crave to look stylish, everyone is obsessed with their looks and their brand outfits, but I neither gave importance to my look nor about my outfits.I always had a dream to leave this materialistic world and to take oath as a saint in Himalayas.I believed in simplicity.I believed in “Don’t be workaholic and money minded person, because the white cloth which will be wrapped around your dead body will have no pockets.”So, I never thought of becoming rich in life. Literally I had zero desire towards money.Today!An incident at 2 am shook me away!!My mother asked me to wake up. She was tensed like hell.Me: Maa, what happened? (I was in shock)She: Your father is struggling to breathe.I ran towards my father. He was literally struggling to breathe and His heart was having a burning sensation.For a moment I was stunned and didn't know what to do?We decided to take him to the hospital. I took out my neighbors mobile number from my dad's phone. (I didn't bother to keep my neighbors number till that moment)I called my neighbor at 2:30 am.At 2:35 am, he came out of his home and he took out his car and waiting for us.Do you believe that? I've been living in this house for the last 6.5 years but have never spoke to my neighbor. Sadly yes, you should believe it.I spoke to him today for the first time in the span of 6.5 years.Somehow, my father felt quite at ease after sometime. So we dropped the plan of going to the hospital.My neighbor and his family came up to my house, as they were waiting outside in a car. They suggested some home remedies. My father felt ease after trying out the suggestion.I thanked my neighbors for coming up at the right time to help. My neighbors asked me to call at any moment, they will be there to help me.My father felt at ease and went to sleep at 3 am. Everything came back to normal, but not my mind.I couldn't sleep after that incident.That's when my life changed! I will explain you in detail in the last paragraph of this answer.A lot of thoughts going in my mind at that very short moment, when I saw my father struggling to breathe.I literally felt ashamed!Because, I was not in a position to say, “Doctor don't worry about money I need my father to get well soon”Yes! The last paragraph!!A very quick moment, never let me to sleep. I started to think of money. Yes! I need money and I want to become rich. Hell with peaceful life.I need to bid goodbye to this ordinary and simple lifestyle. A small moment changed my philosophy of life which I was following from 23.5 years.Sometimes, I used to question myself.“When people know that they will be going to die one or the other day. Why they are making money? Why they are going for higher packages despite getting a good Package in their old company.”But, today I got the answer.Life is a b*tch, it teaches the valuable lessons at the worst moments. I should stop being average. I need to earn more and live a comfortable life henceforth.People change because of their circumstances and situations. People grow from their pains. People learn from their pains. People attain maturity from the worst phases they have undergone.Let me change my life to a better one. Let me take my life quite seriously. Let me get settled down soon. Let me stop all my bad habits.Everything happens for the best, because it teaches you the lesson for your improvement.Sayonara!!(Your little appreciation and honest feedback makes me write even more.

Think about life. Run a few rapids. Hike a little. Try to ignore the pain in my body, the emptiness in my soul, and the lack of a real future.I’d packed everything the afternoon before so I could just get up and get on the road, so I was very annoyed when I turned the key and didn’t even get a click from the starter. I tried the lights, nope. I tried the horn, it made a weak squawk then died. Totally dead battery.Crap.Grumbling to myself, I got the battery charger out of the box marked “garage” on the porch of my apartment and hooked it up to the dead battery in my car. With an hour to kill, I went inside to check e-mails and cruise the net.There was the usual pile of low priority semi-spam in my inbox, including a notification from the NY state public school teaching job message board. I hadn’t seen anything useful on the site for over a month; it was past the main April/May hiring time and before the August panic. The body of the message didn’t show anything, but on a whim I clicked on it to check out the full listings.Near the bottom of the list there was an ad for an opening for a Physics(Chemistry/Biology) teacher, 5+ years experience preferred, deadline for applications this coming Monday at 8 AM. Somehow I’d missed hearing about this opening; it had been on the board for almost a month. I checked out the location… rural school, about a half hour away from Albany, in the foothills of the Green/Berkshire/Taconic mountains. My kind of place. I checked out the travel time… about two hours away.If I could get cleaned up, get my professional things together and get my car to start in less than an hour then I could just about make it there before everyone left for the weekend. If nothing else, I could take a look at the place and I could make sure that my application was on the top of the pile in the principal’s inbox for the Monday morning deadline.My car didn’t start until after a full hour on the charger, so I got to the school just as all of the kids were stampeding out the door and onto the buses. The first person I talked to out in front of the school just happened to be the principal. He noticed the kayak up on top of my car, and since he is an outdoors-person we hit it off immediately. What followed was the best non-interview interview of my life; I was the man with all of the right answers.“We’re replacing a third of the staff next year, we could use someone with experience.”“I’ve been teaching eleven years.”“This is a rural school. It’s not like teaching in the suburbs.”“Yeah, the school I taught at was in the middle of the Adirondack Mountains… much smaller than this place actually.”“The listing says Physics, but the person we hire will need to cover another science. We’re not sure which one right now, either Chem or Bio.”“Not a problem. I’m certified in all three of those. And Earth Science. And General Science too. And I’ve taught them all. Several times in fact.”It went like that for the entire hour that I was there, and after it was done I drove away with a very good job in my pocket, the day before it was going to go away. After ten years in this job I still think I am one of the luckiest teachers in New York State. I have a great administration (both are former science teachers), a very supportive community, easy students to work with, excellent co-workers, a great workspace, lots of materials and supplies, and the freedom to innovate. Every morning I wake up to fresh air and a view of the mountains. My commute to work is 5 minutes by car, 8 minutes by bike, and 10 minutes by hiking through the woods. I do not need to lock my house when I leave, or lock my car or my bike on the end of the commute. I live close enough to a city that I can get a dose of culture or find things that I need when I want them, but far enough away that I don’t have to deal with the drawbacks of urban or suburban life.Ten years later I still think that I’ve found my perfect job.And if my car had started that morning, I’d never have found it.",0 followers,User-11441330561143484822,4K,0,0,2018,https://www.quora.com/Why-is-the-Tesla-Roadsters-top-speed-so-low-Is-it-a-limit-of-currently-available-motor-technology-or-is-there-a-different-limiting-factor
