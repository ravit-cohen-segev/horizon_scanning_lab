In 2018 a french Leclerc tank turret was mounted on a Leopard 2 hull, to show how it could be made into a three-man auto loaded tank.Additionally, the UK was saying they were looking into making a new tank, though it is not known what came of that yet, it might be a secret project. The US is also making new tank developments, most notably the M1A2C which is expected to start serial production soon. It is however just a stop-gap until a more modern tank can be made, which some call M1A3 but might be an entirely new tank eventually.",277 followers,Helicoptersauce,2.6K,187,3.3M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Is-it-okay-to-switch-to-technology-after-3-years-of-mainframe-development-experience-If-yes-then-which-is-a-good-area-of-technology-to-switch-to

4,"No, there is no need to develop a new tank. There are a handful of parade duty T-14 Armata tanks. Putin's bombastic claim of “ 2,300 ordered by 2020 “ never happened. And it won't happen. You should wonder why the T-14 never was tested in Syria.An upgrade in munitions - the US response - and a possible increase in cannon size ( possible German option - as they don't use DU based penetrators ) handles the T-14.The T-14 is basically a rehash of a 70’s pre-Abrams contender, with some new technologies. Should be a good tank. Looks okay on parade duty. Lots of propoganda noises about it. ObviouslyNo, there is no need to develop a new tank. There are a handful of parade duty T-14 Armata tanks.

But they’re sure not going to bother to design completely new tanks to face the abortive T-14 after the Russians decided it’s not worth building. A penetrating sabot round to the turret or a top-attack guided missile on the fighting compartment will disable a new elite T-14 as well as it would an old third-lineThe real response to Russian tanks in the field came after the RF started sending them into eastern Ukraine in 2014. Ukrainian military industry has been digging into its war stores and upgrading hundreds of T-64 tanks, along with dozens of T-80UD and T-72, to meet or exceed the capabilities of the average Russian tank in service. And Ukraine is receiving stocks of FGM-148 Javelin antitank missiles from the USA, to be used for training so far, but representing a serious threat to any invasion by current or future Russian armoured formations.The RF still does want to be a poor man’s “superpower,” and intends to maintain its escalation dominance in eastern Ukraine.

8,"Look at the real world. Tanks are military toys that don’t really matter much. They cannot defend themselves from airplanes and missiles. The battlefield will be controlled by whoever controls the air space of the battlefield.Any tank force from any country that tries to challenge F-35s and their missile/bomb trucks along with Apache helicopters and C-130s is going to lose its tanks and their supply lines. This is why Russia, the US, and all other countries that have to balance a military budget are not buying new tanks and are taking existing tanks out of the active inventory.

This is why Russia, the US, and all other countries that have to balance a military budget are not buying new tanks and are taking existing tanks out of the active inventory. Tanks that are mothballed can’t be shoved into service at a moments notice because it takes time and money to train new tank crews and build up the logistic system to support them.Russia is trying, without any good reason, to defend a huge amount of geography. Tanks would seem useful for the mobility that it takes to defend this large land mass; however, the tanks would end up being a waste of manpower and budget as any attack on Russia would end up being an air and missile attack. Russia realizes this and isn’t moving forward with the Armada at this time. Russia is spending big bucks on the S-400/500 air defense systems instead of tanks and aircraft carriers.China might find use for tanks to mass along its coastline, but, like Russia, China would end up fighting an air and missile war. China is spending its military budget on high end fighters, air defense systems, and aircraft carriers to protect its shores from attack and project power into its area of influence. The Himalayas are a poor place to fight a tank war.Tanks might be useful in a battle zone where the air battle isn’t important like West Africa or Afghanistan, but heavy tanks are too expensive to operate for most players in those areas, and tanks can be hindered by IEDs and some shoulder fired weapons.",658 followers,Tom Fessenden,1K,2.4K,6.1M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Are-any-NATO-tanks-in-development-as-response-to-Russias-Armata-tank-to-match-it-in-firepower-armor-and-technology

Remember, the Armata is basically the Russians catch-up design to the 4th generation of tanks. Its a solid weapon system, but it not a battle-tested or time-tested tank like all of its most likely opponents.

All of these designs were great for their time, but were always outclassed by time itself, then the 70sand 80s happened where Soviet tank design went downhill fast. The t72 (made in 1972) was already matched by the m60 that was built ironically in 1960. Then, the design was buried by the M1 Abrams and their response was the t80 which couldn't hold a candle to the M1.",534 followers,Alberto Amoruso,546,499,1.8M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Are-any-NATO-tanks-in-development-as-response-to-Russias-Armata-tank-to-match-it-in-firepower-armor-and-technology
10,"There is no more complicated answer that it is fabulously difficult and expensive. In the near term, there is going to be no return on investment.

Even setting aside the money and the will, the technological challenges are huge. Both Mars and the Moon are horribly inhospitable. Setting up a self-sustaining colony requires extremely carefully designed technologies. It's not just that the technologies have to work, but they have to be 100% reliable or the whole colony will die. That sort of reliability is not a trivial thing. And even aside from those basic considerations, solar radiation is a massive problem. Populations on the moon or Mars must receive a lot of protection to survive. Building some sort of dome that can provide that kind of protection is a big undertaking. Some experts have suggested that underground colonies may be more realistic. But trying to transport the heavy equipment to do that is not a small thing either.Nobody doubts that there will be colonies eventually, but despite how easy science fiction movies make it look, you should not underestimate just how challenging this is.","105,674 followers",Dave Consiglio,5.5K,6.8K,91.6M,UNKNOWN,https://www.quora.com/Is-it-okay-to-switch-to-technology-after-3-years-of-mainframe-development-experience-If-yes-then-which-is-a-good-area-of-technology-to-switch-to
