Post-secondary education in the US - colleges and universities - are a vast mix of public and private institutions most without shared origins or shared administration.",0 followers,Dylan Owens,3K,271,26.9M,2021,https://www.quora.com/How-much-is-the-US-education-system-secondary-college-lagging-behind-on-the-education-of-new-emerging-technologies-in-the-sciences-especially-medical

2,"I’m a good student.Scratch that, I’m an excellent student. My grades are spot on, I do great on tests, and my standardized test scores are phenomenal. I’m great at school.I can study for a test in half the time other people can. I can crank out an assignment the night before and get an A. I can show up at the SAT after one hour of studying and score in the 98% percentile. I’m an amazing student.But guess what. I don’t know anything.-I’m damn good at remembering stuff, but I don’t learn it. I remember it just long enough for my test or assignment, then I forget it a day later.

Then I cram my brain with new info, take the test, and forget it. Rinse and repeat.I’ve broken the system. I learn very little in school. Very little. I don’t remember 99% of what stuff I learned a month ago. I probably only remember about 10% of what I learned last week.But according to the system, I’m learning tons. My grades are stellar. My tests are great. According to all quantitative records, I’m being educated incredibly well.But I’m not. I’ve just learned how to screw the system. I don’t learn, I take in and spit out the required amount of information, then delete it from my brain.My education isn’t an education. It’s a constant balance of finding out how to get the highest grade for the least amount of work. It’s suvival of the fittest, and I’m one of the fittest.I do waaaaay less work than most people. Far less. But since I’ve mastered study techniques that let me cram info into my brain really fast, and keep the info in my brain forSchool has taught me how to be good atGive me and average Joe each 10 minutes to study for a test, and I’ll do better on the test. I promise you. Come back and talk to us in a week, and average Joe will probably remember more. He’ll probably even be able to apply it to real life. But it doesn’t matter. We already took the test.-I have screwed the system. Completely destroyed it. I am not an educated person. I am not being educated. I am a person that learned how to take advantage of the system.But guess what? According to anyone that looks at my transcript, I’ve gotten an incredible education.They're wrong. I don’t give a crap about most of my classes. I do the absolute minimum, and get the grade. The few subjects I care about, I use the same study method because it’s what I’ve always done. It’s what I know.-I am not getting educated. I am clinically manipulating a broken system to fit my needs.Students being able to do this is what’s wrong with American education.",4 followers,Matthew Bates,1.4K,9.8K,293.1M,2018,https://www.quora.com/How-much-is-the-US-education-system-secondary-college-lagging-behind-on-the-education-of-new-emerging-technologies-in-the-sciences-especially-medical

I made a drone for disaster management last year (when I was 14) for which I got selected for the national level CBSE science exhibition. And yes the system didn’t teach me a shit about it, instead it just gave me so much pressure and complaints from teachers that I am not concentrating on my accademics. And what the fuck is all about this uniform shit. Most students hate it. Like they have to wear formal shitty looking pants and insterted shirt. And a worthless shoes. And they have some disciplinary shits likeGUYS and GALS, Plz consider upvoting this if you like it.",0 followers,Sheng Zhong,2.2K,659,1.6M,2019,https://www.quora.com/How-much-is-the-US-education-system-secondary-college-lagging-behind-on-the-education-of-new-emerging-technologies-in-the-sciences-especially-medical

6,"Here’s my perspective as a former public school student and current private school teacher. What education in America needs, more than anything else at this point, is a lot more truth in the conversation. Once that happens, the solutions will be obvious.Truth: Most problems with education today originate in students’ homes, and there is little to nothing schools can do to help students who have little to no support system inside of the home.Solution: Just accepting this fact will help bring other solutions to the table. PoliticiansHere’s my perspective as a former public school student and current private school teacher. What education in America needs, more than anything else at this point, is a lot more truth in the conversation. Once that happens, the solutions will be obvious.Truth: Most problems with education today originate in students’ homes, and there is little to nothing schools can do to help students who have little to no support system inside of the home.Solution: Just accepting this fact will help bring other solutions to the table. PoliticiansTruth: Public schools, on average, spend more per student than private schools, yet private schools usually get better results. A lot of this is because private schools can be selective in who they let in. The best schools in the country are selective one way or another: because they’re magnet schools, private schools, or draw their students completely from affluent areas, so their students are de facto selective based on ability to afford that area. The worst schools are the schools that have to take all students, and a majority of those students come from impoverished areas.Solution: School choice. Allow parents to tell the government which school should be paid for educating their child, even if it’s a private school. It’s the best life preserver to throw to the students with potential who are drowning in failing schools that we have right now. Any other solution would take decades to implement, has probably already been tried and failed, and would lead to unintended consequences that would make things worse for many. A $1:$1 tax rebate for private school tuition would also work here.Truth: A significant amount of teacher’s time is spent documenting bad behavior from students, and a significant number of students will not behave unless they are being watched constantly.Solution: Security-style cameras in the classroom. Instead of wasting time trying to write exactly how a student “was giving attitude” to a teacher, knowing that “giving attitude” is never enough to write, a teacher could just write the time and the classroom the incident happened, and let the administration and parents see it for themselves. This would also help a lot for my next truth:Truth: In most places, a student can give up and drop out of school at age 16, but a school district is required to provide some sort of educational services to a student until they’re 21. A lot of taxpayer money is essentially wasted on older students who’ve shown zero interest or ability in being educated and cause disruptions for other students.Solution: Just as a student can give up on school at age 16, a school should be able to give up on a student at that age. There should be a “push out” age, just as there is a “drop out” age. The criterion for being pushed out should be based completely on discipline records, not academic ability. If a student only seems to come to school to cause problems, the school shouldn’t have to deal with them.",0 followers,Ted Kord,1.3K,1.2K,11.8M,2019,https://www.quora.com/How-much-is-the-US-education-system-secondary-college-lagging-behind-on-the-education-of-new-emerging-technologies-in-the-sciences-especially-medical
7,"GRAPHENEIt is a material which is basically graphite compressed into a one atom thick sheet.Potentially, it could revolutionize every single part of technology. It is stiffer than diamond. Conducts electricity 250 times better than silicon. 10 times better heat conductot than copper. Biomedical applications.The only problem is it's incredibly expensive to make. Once someone figures out a way to make cheaper graphene… Oh boy.It can easily become the highest earning industry in the world.","246,862 followers",Dushka Zapata,1.5K,8.5K,232.5M,2018,https://www.quora.com/How-much-is-the-US-education-system-secondary-college-lagging-behind-on-the-education-of-new-emerging-technologies-in-the-sciences-especially-medical
