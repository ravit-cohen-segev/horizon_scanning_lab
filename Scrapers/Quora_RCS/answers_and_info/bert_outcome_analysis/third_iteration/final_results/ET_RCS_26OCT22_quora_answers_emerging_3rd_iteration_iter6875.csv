In other words, a dog’s bark meansAs best we can understand, non-human animals most likely think in images, and thus, technology is not going to allow us to create a verbal “translator”. Instead, humans are learning the relevant behaviors that other animals use to communicate, usually using eye contact, posture and head or body position. For example, when a dog turns away from you, he's not feeling “guilty” which is a human emotion, instead, he's telling you to calm down. We know this because we see dogs doing this in social situations that have no relationship to “guilt” but instead, when a conspecific gets overly excited or confrontational.Image from petprofessor.com","3,781 followers",Teodora Greywoolf,7.6K,3.5K,13M,2017,https://www.quora.com/Is-there-a-realistic-and-fact-based-estimate-as-to-when-we-will-develop-technology-to-talk-to-cats-and-dogs
1,"You can do it right now. Most of the technology has been around for millions of years: Body parts. A whole lot of people have used them successfully to communicate with cats and dogs and there isn’t a lot technology could do better.Two things come to mind, where technology can help: scent and ultrasonic sounds. We’re not very good with either.If you expect to be able to talk to a cat or dog like you talk to a human, even a small child, you’ll be disappointed.

2,"Cats actually have a ability to talk to people, and people can do it too if they follow the right method. This is a video I created to present a program that completely transform my communication with my cats:Couple months ago I decided to spend a few bucks to give it a try. It does not really make my cats understand me 100% but the results I get is more comprehensive conversation between me and her. It’s really exciting. Just think that if you guys have cats as best friends in your sweet home, it is nice to try this method.",1 follower,Catherine Campbell,1.8K,68,524.1K,2017,https://www.quora.com/Is-there-a-realistic-and-fact-based-estimate-as-to-when-we-will-develop-technology-to-talk-to-cats-and-dogs

I hate making you sad.I don’t know if you’re aware but cats usually attack any hand that touches their bellies or paws. I am so grateful that you don’t do that and that you never scratch or bite me. Well, except for when you attack my legs when I’m walking trough the house but I can live with that. Please just don’t take the belly rubs away from me because I live for your soft, warm belly.Every single time I’ve accidentally stepped on your paw or tripped over you, it has DESTROYED ME. I’m so sorry!!!!! I would never do it on purpose and I hope you can forgive me.Our 5 minutes are probably almost up so I love you. Very, very, very much. Just remember that.

4,"It would be a terrible thing if dogs and cats could talk.Cats would constantly be telling their owners exactly what, when, and how to do everything to please them. They do that now but it's usually in a silent fashion.I'm sure all dogs would sound like Scooby-Do.

5,"Dogs, like humans, have various levels of intelligence and attention span. A dog that is very focused on you 24/24 and can quickly get the link between sounds and the action that follows will learn most of your daily vocabulary.

We didn’t say it at all, we just made a movement gesture… he did learn that. We replaced it with “go-for-you-know-what” He did learn “you-know-what” means something we don’t want to disclose and he perks up whenever we use the expression.He looks at whoever is speaking and makes faces according to what he understands: he’s a very expressive guy and I must admit that most of the time he’s correct. He doesn’t really get our jokes, but then he sees us laughing… and “gets it” at that point.I think they can learn more than we give them credit for. But, just as children, this requires constant attention, repetition, and helping them when they have difficulties understanding something.Jack-Big-Butt:","91,638 followers",Roland Bartetzko,748,3.5K,314.8M,2021,https://www.quora.com/Is-there-a-realistic-and-fact-based-estimate-as-to-when-we-will-develop-technology-to-talk-to-cats-and-dogs
6,"Yes, that’s true. Social media improves our communication skills as we get to talk to an unlimited number of people. The Internet has increased our reach.

7,"No. What do you thing regeneration is? It's because we make new cells to replace damaged or over-used cells is how we're are able to live to any age in the first place. For some cells, their entire purpose is to die. These include skin cells, cells of the intestinal tract, and cells of the urigentital tract.Neurons of course don't divide, but it doesn't mean they don't have their own problems as they age. They can accumulate a lot of damage over the decades, and unlike other tissue where they would just simply die and be replaced, neurons endure.

8,"Nope. How would you “reprogram” them—CRISPR-Cas9? If you think that, you don’t understand CRISPR and its method, applications, and limitations. Even if you reprogrammed some of the cells, how would you get such changes into all the other cells of the body? How would you replace the reprogrammed ones as they soon, and inevitably, died out? How would you deal with all the other causes of aging, deterioration, and death that have little or nothing to do with the genes or any meaningful way in which cells are already “programmed” or could be potentially “reprogrammed”?","28,769 followers",Ray Schilling,608,8K,102.5M,2020,https://www.quora.com/Is-there-a-realistic-and-fact-based-estimate-as-to-when-we-will-develop-technology-to-talk-to-cats-and-dogs
