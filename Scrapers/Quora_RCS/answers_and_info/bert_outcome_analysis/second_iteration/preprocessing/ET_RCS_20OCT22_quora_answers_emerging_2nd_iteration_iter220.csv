We need to put more energy in the machine than we get out from the fusion.The most notable fusion reactor working today (we actually built it more than 30 years ago) is the JET (Joint European Torus), and it’s in England.But things might change in the next 10–15 years. It seems to me that no other answer has mentioned that basically half of the world has been united under the ITER consortium, and is working hard at building the first fusion reactor which is really believed to be capable of sustaining fusion efficiently. It is infact called ITER, and it’s being built in Cadarache, France. It should produce the first plasma in 2025, and in theory it will be capable of outputting 10 times more energy than will be needed to ignite the plasma.I follow the Facebook page of the project,So yes, at the moment fusion reactors produce less power (basically zero). Not because of physics, but engineering.PS: It is true that so far this technology has not produced impressive results compared to fission reactors. But there’s a big but. Research into fission nuclear reactors was financed with truckloads of $$ because a fission reactor can give us plutonium, that can be used to build nuclear weapons. On the contrary, fusion reactors research has got no military applications, because you cannot weaponise the products of fusion. So the amount of cash which went into fusion was puny, and it still is (the same happened with thorium reactors: they’re no use for nuclear weapons and so they didn’t get the BIG MONEY).","3,657 followers",Brent Oster,3.6K,357,1.8M,https://www.quora.com/Why-are-nuclear-fusion-reactors-not-made
4,"Lets look at this pragmatically.A fusion reactor would fuse a deuterium atom with a tritium atom into a helium-4 nuclei and a free neutron. Lets look at the mass of the reactants and products.Deuterium:Tritium:Helium-4:Neutron:Lets sum the mass of the reactants and the mass of the products.ΣΣThe difference in those values isSo what happenLets look at this pragmatically.A fusion reactor would fuse a deuterium atom with a tritium atom into a helium-4 nuclei and a free neutron. Lets look at the mass of the reactants and products.Deuterium:Tritium:Helium-4:Neutron:Lets sum the mass of the reactants and the mass of the products.ΣΣThe difference in those values isSo what happened to that mass? We all know that conservation of mass is a thing, so what gives? Well mass has still been conserved, but we must look at things through the eyes of relativity. UsingNow lets look at splitting Uranium-235 (U-235) by shooting a free neutron into its nuclei; the nuclei splits and one of the outcomes that is possible which we will be exploring further with is Krypton 92 (Kr-92), Barium 141 (Ba-141), and 3 free neutrons.mmmmΣΣThe difference isSo already we can see that fusion has its advantages in energy production, but what else is advantageous about fusion reactors? The most heavily pursued type right now uses superconducting magnets to confine a hot plasma of the hydrogen isotopes allowing them to fuse together into helium. If the reaction gets out of hand and can no longer be contained the hot plasma will damage the superconducting magnets causing the inwards acting pressure to cease. The hot plasma can then diffuse, expanding and cooling rapidly; in an instant it is no longer hot enough for the hydrogen nuclei to overcome the electrostatic repulsion between them meaning they cannot fuse. In short, a runaway nuclear reaction causing a meltdown has no where near the catastrophic consequences of a fission reactor meltdown like Chernobyl.Tokamak fusion reactor. The hollowed out chamber houses the plasma and is surrounded by superconducting magnetsChernobylOne last final point worth mentioning. The radioactivity of the products. U-235 has a half life of 703.8 million years. A one kilogram block of U-235 takes 703.8 million years to decay to the point that only half a kilogram of the material remaining is U-235, with the other half kilogram having decayed into lighter elements.Decay curve of U-235; y=mass x=time in yearsSame graph but looking at just the first 100 years. Notice how there is negligible change in mass. I could have a kilogram of nuclear reactor fuel sitting next to me for my entire lifespan and receive a negligible amount of radiation.The products of this reaction are Kr-92 and Ba-141, which have half lives of 210ms and 18.27mins respectively. These further break down into other radioactive isotopes with varying decay rates. For example, Cesium-137 has a half life of about 30 years. After a hundred years a kilogram sample of the products of nuclear fission will have decayed into ridiculously small amounts (calculate it if you want, but the specifics aren't relevant for this) with me receiving an incredibly lethal dose of radiation.The threat determined by half life figures goes contrary to the usual rule of thumb as a safer value will be in one of the extremes but anywhere in the middle and the threat posed is far higher. Extremely short half life (e.g. 210ms for Kr-92) isotopes release radiation at a high rate but decay so quickly that after the material is kept safely stored for a short duration of time so little of it remains that the emission rate will have dropped to a far more acceptable level. Extremely long half lives (e.g. 700 million years for U-235) release radiation at such a slow rate at any given point its effects are negligible. If the half life is neither extremely long or short (e.g. 12 years for tritium), its going to emit radiation at a dangerous rate and continue to do so for a not so insignificant amount of time.Deuterium is a stable isotope and Tritium has a half life of 12.32 years. The products are Helium-4 which is a stable isotope and a free neutron which decays into energy (photons) in about 10 mins, at which point its products can no longer undergo further radioactive decay. In other words, fission reactors take an isotope that isn't very dangerous and produces highly dangerous waste while fusion reactors would take a highly dangerous fuel and produce relatively safe products.I’ll let you decide which is better.",2 followers,Richard Muller,1.7K,2.3K,201.9M,https://www.quora.com/Why-are-nuclear-fusion-reactors-not-made

6,"Unlike nuclear fission, fusion reactions do not release the majority of their energy as heat.Efficient conversion of fusion energy into electrical energy is more challenging and complex than in the case of converting fission nuclear energy where about 98% of energy released from nuclear fission is released as heat.In DT fusion, the fusion reaction most likely to first be harnessed to produce controlled release of fusion energy, 80% of the energy released goes into 14MeV neutrons and only the remaining 20% of energy released as alpha particles which can be readily absorbed in some medium to becUnlike nuclear fission, fusion reactions do not release the majority of their energy as heat.Efficient conversion of fusion energy into electrical energy is more challenging and complex than in the case of converting fission nuclear energy where about 98% of energy released from nuclear fission is released as heat.In DT fusion, the fusion reaction most likely to first be harnessed to produce controlled release of fusion energy, 80% of the energy released goes into 14MeV neutrons and only the remaining 20% of energy released as alpha particles which can be readily absorbed in some medium to become heat.D-D fusion of deuterium separated from sea water is not a fusion reaction that is considered to be practical in Magnetic Confinement Fusion devices intended to produce fusion with energy gain (more power from the fusion reactor than it takes to operate the fusion reactor). This is because D-D fusion reaction rates in MCF fusion devices we know how to build are too low to result in break-even energy with D-D fusion. The situation is different however with Inertial Confinement Fusion. Commercially significant D-D fusion in Inertial Confinement Fusion reactors using pure deuterium fuel separated from sea water is practical but energy conversion in this case is unfortunately somewhat complex, with about 66% of the energy release from D-D fusion being released as energetic neutrons.D-D Fusion of Deuterium fuel produces energy through four reactions:D + D -> He-3 + n + 3.268 MeVD + D -> T + p + 4.03 MeV(side chains)D + T -> He-4 + n + 17.588 MeVHe-3 + D -> He-4 + p + 18.34 MeVThe net effect of these four fusion reactions taken together is:6 D -> 2 He-4 + 2p + 2n + 43.243 MeVWhile 66% of the energy of D-D fusion is released in fusion neutrons, a significant amount of energy is also released in charged protons and alpha particles.Unlike the charged particles, the uncharged neutrons cannot be confined by a magnetic field, and for this reason cannot be easily used for a direct conversion into electric energy.Some first generation fusion power plant concepts have featured early power conversion designs that primarily use fusion heat to produce electricity and use the larger 80% fraction of fusion energy found in energetic neutrons to breed Tritium in a breeding blanket loaded with Lithium-6.It is possible to propose energy conversion systems for D-D fusion power plants that attempt to capture some of the energy released by D-D fusion fast neutrons and turn that energy into heat. For such a system, the neutrons have to be slowed down in some medium (like molten lithium), heating this medium to a temperature of less than 10^3K. The heat collected in the lithium blanket is then removed from this medium and is used to drive a turbine-generator. This conversion of nuclear into electric energy unfortunately has a Carnot efficiency of about 30%.Using a lithium blanket to capture a portion of the energy in fusion neutrons, which is 80% of the energy released from DT fusion and 66% of the energy released from D-D fusion , the energy conversion efficiency is low - no more than 24% over all. Further, liquid lithium metal is very flammable at temperature likely to exist in operating first generation fusion reactors. Use of hot molten lithium metal as a neutron absorber - coolant could compromise the intrinsic safety of first generation fusion reactors. We should be trying to engineer the safest commercial fusion reactors we know how to design. I believe it would be better to consider using a safer coolant such as molten salts in first generation fusion reactors. Molten salts cannot spontaneously burst into flame when coming into contact with air or water in a large accident while compromising overall fusion reactor safety.While this relatively low 24% conversion efficiency of fusion energy into electrical energy cannot be overcome in magnetic confinement reactors we currently know how to build,ICF fusion power plants (both DT and DD) can be accomplished higher energy conversion efficiency by surrounding the inertial confinement fusion target with a sufficiently thick layer of liquid hydrogen and a thin outer layer of boron, creating a hot plasma fire ball. The hydrogen layer must be chosen just thick and dense enough to be heated by the neutrons to 100,000 degrees K. The so generated, fully ionized, and rapidly expanding hydrogen fire ball can then drive a pulsed magnetohydrodynamic generator at an almost 100% Carnot efficiency [1].Magnetohydrodynamic Conversion of Fusion Energy into Electrical Energy -Electrostatic direct conversion -More advanced fusion reactions like p-B11 and He3-He3 that released a larger proportion of fusion energy as charged particles (protons and alpha particles) can use direct collection of charged particles working against magnetic or electrostatic field or directly collect particles on stationary screens to convert fusion energy charged particles into electrical energy at high efficiency[2].Electrostatic direct conversion uses a charged particles’ motion to make a voltage. This voltage drives electricity in a wire. This becomes the electrical power. It is normally thought of in reverse. Ordinarily, a voltage puts a particle in motion. Direct conversion does the opposite. It uses a particle's motion to produce a voltage. It has been described as a linear accelerator running backwards. An early supporter of this method was Richard F. Post at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. He proposed a way to capture the kinetic energy of charged particles as they were exhausted from a fusion reactor and convert this into voltage, which would drive current in a wire. Dr. Post helped developed the theoretical underpinnings of direct conversion, which was later demonstrated by Dr. William Barr and Dr.Ralph Moir at LLNL. They demonstrated a 48 percent energy capture efficiency on the Tandem Mirror Experiment in 1981. In subsequent decades, the efficiency of converting the energy in charged particles as are produced in advanced fusion reactions into electricity was demonstrated at efficiencies as high as 80%, which is about twice as high an efficiency as the best current thermal power plant turbine generators can demonstrate while converting heat into electricity.[1] -","220,147 followers",Franklin Veaux,1.6K,47.3K,779.4M,https://www.quora.com/Why-are-nuclear-fusion-reactors-not-made

They are trying mightily to get one going by itself without massive power from the outside to keep it going. No luck so far.However, there is this: Fission reactors have a LOT of fuel (Uranium, usually) in them. Tons of it! And lots of radioactive decay products of nuclear fission. If something goes disastrously wrong (Chernobyl) there’s an awful lot of radioactive material to spread around.Fusion reactors will presumably have very little fuel at one time, as it gets fed in and burned up continually. Grams, maybe. Pounds - no way! And the “fuel” is relatively harmless. Deuterium, Lithium, stuff like that. The Fusion reactor itself, on the other hand will be quite radioactive: The many tons of whatever its built from will have been intensely irradiated by the fusion going on, producing radioactive material, but I doubt that it can match the wide variety of nasty stuff from a fission reactor. So: I think a fission reactor would have far more potential for radioactive contamination than a fusion reactor, once we have one. But explosive danger? No.[ Thought added in edit: I do see one problem peculiar to the type of fusion reactors we’re working on now: the huge magnetic field they require. These magnetic field are critical to the fusion reactor operation, and the stronger the field, the smaller the reactor can be. These fields store a LOT of energy, and depend upon superconductors to keep the huge currents flowing. If part of the electric circuit drops out of superconductivity, the energy gets dumped into that failed part, and will create a huge electric arc, likely destroying the field coils, possibly destroying the whole system. Something similar happened in the early days of the supercollider in Switzerland/France. No hydrogen explosion, probably nothing to scatter things far and wide, so little danger to surrounding community, and they have ways to prevent this happening, they think.
