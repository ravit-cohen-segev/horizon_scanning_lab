3,"The correct answer is ""finish in ample time"".The only real point of a supercomputer is that it's very, very fast. In the early days, supercomputers were fast because they processed vectors: single instruction, multiple data. The Cray 1 had sixty-four 64-bit vector registers. With compilers that could optimize for vector processing, supercomputers could do in minutes what might take conventional computers weeks.As microprocessors evolved, they added their own sort of vector instructions, and other means to get fast performance.

In the early days, supercomputers were fast because they processed vectors: single instruction, multiple data. The Cray 1 had sixty-four 64-bit vector registers. With compilers that could optimize for vector processing, supercomputers could do in minutes what might take conventional computers weeks.As microprocessors evolved, they added their own sort of vector instructions, and other means to get fast performance. The Nintendo 64 came 21 years later than the Cray 2, with more performance on 3D graphics than a Cray could achieve. Before long, there was little point in building custom supercomputer CPU architectures that competed with commodity microprocessors. But the whole point of a supercomputer isn't any specific thing, like vector processing, it's about being crazy fast. So the modern supercomputer is built from an large matrix of commodity microprocessors and, more recently, GPUs. The Cray Titan, for example, is built from 18,688 AMD Operton CPUs paired with an equal number of nVidia Tesla GPUs to perform at a theoretical peak of 27 petaFLOPS (AMD's Opteron architecture, based around HyperTransport links, made it easy to build different connection architectures in such machines).Now, if you have 18,688 desktop PCs in your house, you'd think you could compete, but you couldn't. The big trick in building massively parallel computers like these is how to actually get some use out of as many of those processors as possible. If you're not careful, the time spent communicating between CPU and CPU or CPU and GPU can wind up taking more system time than the actual problems you're trying to solve. So the specifics of the connection fabric and how the software helps to parallelize an application bring as much to the table as all those processors.So, back to my original assertion: finishing on time. Supercomputers are used, quite often, on really complex jobs that are time sensitive. Weather forcasting, for example, is all based on a few different weather models that run faster-than-realtime in order to deliver a prediction while it'll still do some good. There are always better models that don't run in realtime, which are always run after-the-fact in the case that most of the working models fail on a critical prediction. Simulation of protein folding, modeling and eventually predicting earthquakes, modeling brains, rendering for a film (probably more likely done on a larger ""server farm"" these days), etc. those are ultra complex to run, and all with practical deadlines.",9 followers,Andrew McGregor,3.3K,12.9K,66.9M,https://www.quora.com/Will-quantum-computing-replace-the-cloud-in-the-future

6,"Computationally there is nothing a super computer cannot do it just scales up all the elements.When you have to solve a problem there are two elements that you need to considerSo any task that is time sensitive it is important to have a CPU that is fast enough to solve the problem.

So although you can run say weather simulation on a normal computer by the time you receive the data it would be useless.The same goes for data say you collect 30 terabyte of data at CERN for an experiment and that data would need to be analysed.

7,"The simple answer is that if you take a typical supercomputer workload, such as modeling the path and intensity of a hurricane on a powerful two socket XEON server, such as the very popular HPE ProLiant which is a commonly used node, it would take over 1,000 hours.

The finite element analysis (aka crash testing) jobs take days to run on powerful single systems, yet can be run in under 1/1000th the time on a supercomputer.It must be pointed out that it can take weeks to set up supercomputers to run a certain type of workload. Optimizing a supercomputer for weather simulations is quite different than setting up a supercomputer for crash testing. This is why NOAA, GM, Ford, Toyota, and Honda have their own supercomputers, that are configured to run their specialized workloads.","9,922 followers",Brett Bergan,1.3K,7K,82.9M,https://www.quora.com/What-can-a-supercomputer-do-that-a-normal-computer-cant

So, obviously, I worked on nothing more than standard desktop PCs.But from what I saw around the Goddard Space Flight Center [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goddard_Space_Flight_Center ], I saw nothing special.Okay, I now confess that isn’t much of an answer, but I’ve got more.THINK LOGICALLYScientifically and logically, it’s not possible for NASA to be using computers 30–40 years ahead of what the public uses.I’ll illustrate.First, think of my experience at NASA working on standard desktops at the time. I also helped set up PCs at NASA at that time and we were dealing with hard drives of hundreds of megabytes. Now, 25 years later, it would take several of them to store just a single movie and they cost hundreds of dollars each back then. So, let’s say four $500 hard drives to store one movie, in 1995 dollars.In today’s dollars that would be $3,700 in disk storage costs for one movie.My iPhone has 512GB of memory. I had a choice to get 256GB, but it cost me only $100 to buy another 256BG—so I did because I’m an old guy and it blows me away how much memory I can get for so cheap.How cheap?If I paid the same for memory today that I paid in 1995—see the pricing above—the 512GB in my iPhone would cost $947,200.LET’S UNWIND THE CLOCK NOWAnd it would take up the space that would fill the back of a typical minivan—based on 800 old PC hard drives, which were about 70 cubic inches each in size.And that is going back only 25 years.The IBM PC hasn’t even turned 40 yet and if I ran the same comparison with the costs and capacity of the 1981 IBM machine that I ran above on a 1995 PC, it would be similarly ridiculous—because, trust that in 1995 we were all blown away by the massive storage we were buying and how unbelievably cheap it had become.To be clear, in 1995 the amount of computer storage that costs $100 today—and is about the size of a postage stamp—cost about a million dollars and we were stunned by how cheap that was.So, there is no way anyone is ever going to have a computer that is 30 years ahead of what the public is using.Because in about 30 years, whatever they have today will fit in your shirt pocket.ADDENDU...","29,784 followers",Tomaž Vargazon,974,7.6K,248.8M,https://www.quora.com/What-can-a-supercomputer-do-that-a-normal-computer-cant

Pick a 3 or 4 letter acronym and we had similar equipment there too. It was the same in those facilities.So hardware wise, 30–40 years is way out there. 5 to 15 years is reasonable. Having made the move from hardware to software in the late 1990s, I’m comfortable saying the software was also that far ahead of the public. After all, you had to have the programming to operate the new functionality on those mainframes.The equipment our company front ended was primarily the Sperry Univac 1100 series mainframes. Our cache disk subsystems were among the first on Earth.As a side note, the first few times sitting in Mission Control during Shuttle launches were extraordinary. After that, it was no different than any other job and kind of boring. Sitting there for 20+ hours doing nothing was pretty boring.Along the back wall of Mission Control there was this glassed-in room full of different desktops and modems. A couple of these were Apple II Cs. Once I popped into that little room. I’d never played with Apples, so I sat down to figure them out.I pulled up a few of the programs on there to see what they did. I finally pulled one up that was almost like a messaging system on FidoNet. I typed in a message figuring it would be sent out at during the nightly FidoNet batch.Imagine my surprise when I got an immediate reply to my message. Before I new it there were three or four of us chatting on this system, each person from a different facility around the country.
