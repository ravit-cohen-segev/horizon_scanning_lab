Researchers in Israel (Dr. Yigal Ronen) designed a thermal aqueous homogeneous reactor [1] that weighed 4.95 kgs and had a radius of 9.6 cm (<4"" radius), used a total of 0.7 kg of Am-242m nuclear fuel, and had a power output of a few kilowatts.

The small Israeli reactor was spherical in shape and was powered by a solution of Am-242(NO3)3 in water. When a fission reactor is very small in size (<10 cm radius sphere) it requires relatively less combined shielding to fully enclose the reactor with an adequate gamma and neutron shield. Really small fission reactors become much more practical if good light weight and compact shielding approaches are used.The minimal critical mass (water reflected) that can be formed is 6.6 g of Am-242m.Los Alamos has recent experience building quite small nuclear reactors using many off the shelf components to reduce cost. LANL is currently testing their kilowatt power space fission reactor called KRUSTY (KilowattSmall fusion reactors for providing power tend to be discounted because no one has recently produced a fusion reactor that actually generates net power.Fusion has however many significant advantages for truly small nuclear power generation applications -Some advantages of fusion for building truly small reactors.1) Fusion has no critical mass requirement, all that a fusion reaction requires is the right conditions be met (temperature, plasma density, and confinement time) to support fusion. As a result, very tiny fusion power plants can potentially be built.2) Fusion fuels are widely available in space. Hydrogen (and deuterium) are the most abundant elements in the universe, fully 10^10 times more abundant than any combination of fission fuels.3) When fusion fails to work, it tends to just flame out, and serious accidents and melt downs do not tend to happen4) Fast Neutrons are somewhat easier and more cost effective to shield than penetrating fission produced gammas.While pure fusion experiments have so far not produced any net energy, impure fusion produced from fission-fusion assemblies works routinely (and has worked since 1952) producing fusion power reliably on demand[2].Proton-Boron-11 fusion is a current interest for the fusion community. p-B11 fusion produces primarily alpha-particles which are easy to shield and have attractive intrinsic safety features for human operators - all of which is vital for a small reactor application. While p-B11 is expected to produce a few neutrons through side reactors, this style of fusion is a good candidate for safely powering small reactor applications.Inertial Confinement Fusion of p-B11 fuel for small reactor applicationsIt has been calculated that ion temperatures of DT ignited targets reach very high values, exceeding 200 keV. This is the temperature above which proton-boron 11 fusion reactivity arrives to high enough levels to be relevant for energy production (and to obtain high fusion energy gain). In the same DT explosion wave, electron temperatures remain at a lower value, usually below 100 keV, which is a helpful feature to reduce radiation and conduction losses from the plasma. A scheme can be devised to exploit proton-boron 11 fusion by using an Inertial Confinement staged fusion device design initiating a controlled fusion deflagration wave in a p-B11 fusion secondary stage while using a much smaller DT spark primary stage. This maximizes the production of fusion energy from p-B11 while reducing the size and cost of the required ICF fusion driver (laser or particle beam).[1] - Y.

These are (a) inertial confinement fusion (ICF) and (b) magnetic confinement fusion (MCF). Beside these we can define the group of miscellaneous concepts which contains electrostatic confinement, and hybrid concepts of MCF and ICF.Besides the distinction in technologies to create fusion there is a coarse distinction in the type of fusion, namely, neutronic and aneutronic fusion. Neutronic fusion means that primarily excess neutrons carry the energy of the fusion reaction and aneutronic fusion means that primarily excess charged particles carry the energy.Inertial confinementA problem with both the Z-machine and the NIF is not being able to have repeated shots, due to the huge power requirements per shot (for both) and the physical limitations of the liners (Z-machine) and the current lasers (NIF). During the coming years NIF is doing a proof-of-concept for nuclear fusion by laser-assisted inertial confinement. Depending on the developments at NIF, HIPER will be constructed in 2028.It provides a different angle for plasma research than controlled fusion which could be used in for instance plasma accelerator development, high energy laser development and tracking technologies.Magnetic confinementThe Tokamak design has been built since the 1950's in various forms and since then the performance numbers have exponentially increased in time with increased size of the reactors and with evolving operating regimes.With project ITER the reactor size is again increased and the expected increase in performance should lead to a net gain in energy over longer confinement times (in the order of minutes). This should take place between 2025-2030. If successful, a follow-up reactor will be built to demonstrate final application as a power plant, between 2045-2055.This is the most costly project so far, but also the one in which the most experience has been built up, systematically and rigourously. The major uncertainty is the quality of the superconducting coils which will only have a cold-test before they are integrated in the final assembly. The established design being worked on today assumes a so-called high-confinement mode (H-mode) as the operating regime. This mode was accidentally discovered in the early eighties during experiments at ASDEX in Germany. However it is accompanied by instabilities at the edge of the plasma (ELM's) which for ITER-sized reactors would lead to destructive heat fluxes going towards the walls, unless the instabilities are continuously mitigated or controlled.In the Tokamak reactor the helical field lines which hold the plasma together are formed by an induced current and toroidal field coils. This current drive is also the cause of many instabilities. In theCategory C, the smaller experimentsAn example of an IEC is the polywell by EMC2. The latest design by EMC2 (the WB8) is still being tested, if successful a 100 MW-design will follow and an aneutronic version o f the WB8 design. A major issue with polywells is their inefficiency to produce fusion reactions due to electron leakage.As an example of FRC, a company called Tri-alpha is developing a magnetic-mirror concept to facilitate aneutronic fusion, it has gathered over $100 million from private investors. The magnetic mirror machine is potentially much simpler and much smaller than the Tokamak-designs. An important advantage is the  fact the fusion products are charged and can thus be used directly to generate electric energy, and since it is charged it can be manipulated using magnetic fields. The charged fusion products can for instance be focussed to create a compact direct power conversion. Important downside is leakage of particles due to the open field line through the center, reducing the efficiency.Focus fusion plasma holds some promise to produce efficient fusion power, however it's reliance on instabilities to generate enough plasma energy/density make it difficult to develop into a continuous and stable energy source, also it is unclear how and if this design can be scaled up to produce net energy.Hybrid concepts: for instance the one by General Fusion, which entails the use of hundreds of cylinders impinging on a single point (equally timed within microseconds) to compress rotating liquid lithium and liquid Lead through shockwaves onto a magnetically confined D-T plasma vortex which is shot into the cavity of the sphere. Here the lithium acts as the Tritium source and energy is transferred through the liquid heating up and expanding. Difficulties are mostly of engineering nature, the problems experienced by magnetic confinement fusion are of less importance here because the confinement time is kept very small. This is called Magnetized Target Fusion (MTF), here a plasmoid of low density is compressed to obtain the require confinement time for fusion.The hybrid concept MagLIF is a combination of a Z-pinch machine and a laser based confinement system. The basic mode of operation is as follows, first a magnetically confined plasma of deuterium and tritium is generated in a Hohlraum using a high-power laser, then the Hohlraum is pinched (i.e. compressed) by a current shot. Again, just as with the Z-machine, and the NIF, repeated shots are very difficult due to excessive heat loads on the liners, which carry the huge currentshots in the order of 50 million amperes.Another concept is a hybrid fusion/fission reactor, where part of the output energy is delivered by a fission reaction which is catalyzed by the high energy neutrons from the fusion reactions. This way fissionable material can be used without producing much (if any) nuclear waste.The major difficulties for sustained energy production, for both inertial and magnetic confinement are; (I) material degradation and activation due to neutron fluency [especially for neutronic fusion], (II) pollution control, (III) maintenance and specifically for magnetic confinement; continuous control of the plasma dynamics and prevention of damaging instabilities (IV).(I) Neutron fluency destabilizes wall materials to produce short-lived radioactive waste, and due to transmutation actually change the element type, Wolfram for instance can change to Lead. A possible solution that is being experimented with now is the use of liquid lithium flowing over the reactor walls.(II) How do we insert fuel without creating too much disturbance and how do we get rid of the fusion products efficiently.(III) As said, especially for neutronic fusion the wall will be radioactive and maintenance of the components inside the reactor will require special robotic tools.(IV) Confinement time is one of the most important performance indicators of any experimental magnetic confinement fusion reactor. It requires control systems which can (predictively) respond accurately within milliseconds and continuous monitoring of all the relevant plasma parameters. The relatively low density of the plasma requires relatively long confinement times for there to be enough collisions. This requirement of long confinement time is the most limiting factor for MCF, regardless of whether the reaction is neutronic or aneutronic.Aneutronic fusion requires much higher temperatures and it is likely less stable in terms of plasma dynamics due to the heavier Boron ions. However, a pure aneutronic fusion reaction will not (radio)activate and degrade the wall, it will open up the possibility for direct power conversion as well as magnetic control over the expelled fusion products since they are charged.Superconducting coilsI mention this separately because technological developments in this area are not only crucial for the viability of magnetic confinement fusion, they are also partly detached from the fusion plasma research in the sense that maximizing the maximum magnetic field that can be generated is a goal in itself.There are two recent developments of interest for this topic:I personally have no doubt that we will harness fusion energy. In terms of technology it is not a matter of possible or impossible but rather of perseverance, boldness and expediency. Expediency, because nuclear fusion is likely to require more time to reach full potential then for instance solar or wind energy which are already being put to market. So there is a risk of the public and politics losing interest and thus of funding being cut away from the big projects like ITER and HIPER. In the mean time a lot of private investment capital is being spent on experimental, say category (c), concepts which hold promise of success but certainly do not give guarantees. This requires boldness now, and especially in the future if these concepts do not immediately live up to expectations. Perseverance because the concept of nuclear fusion is by far superior to wind or solar in terms of the technology gained and the ecological footprint it leaves.Please add/edit.","3,657 followers",Brent Oster,3.6K,357,1.8M,https://www.quora.com/How-compact-can-we-make-a-nuclear-power-generator

When your fuel is solid you have to shut down the reactor to refuel it. First you let it cool off, then pull the top off to open it up.Then pull out the most-used fuel assemblies from the center of the reactor, and then move the less-used fuel assemblies towards the center of the reactor.Check that everything is as it should be, then close up the reactor, check everything again, and finally restart the reactor. The plant is down for months doing this. That’s the bad news. The good news is that this is a scheduled outage, likely performed at a time of the year when less power is needed (eg spring or fall), and so the grid operators can plan around the outage.Oh, there is another reason you have to replace the most-used solid fuel assemblies every so often. Let’s face it, being a fuel pellet in a running reactor is not the most gentle way to pass your time. You crack because of thermal stresses and because of single atoms of uranium being replaced by two atoms of fission product taking up more space and making the fuel swell. Being the cladding holding the fuel pellets in place is not a gentle way to make a living either. So quite aside from the amount of fissionable material dropping to levels which are too low, the fuel assemblies have to be replaced before the cladding degrades.So that’s why today’s nuclear power reactors must be shut down periodically thus giving them a capacity factor of about 90%.Oh, BTW, solar and wind have capacity factors which, on average, are about 25% and 33% depending on where they are placed.

My former father-in-law also worked at Lawrence Berkeley Labs, and was an engineer designing superconducting coil magnets and had decades of experience working with fusion researchers, even though his primary application was particle accelerators. From having many long conversations with these very intelligent and qualified people I realized that there are some really hard problems that block practical fusion, with no immediate solutions in sight.The only place we know of working, large-scale, energy-generating fusion reactions is at the center of a star, where the gravity of the massive star creates the necessary density, temperature, and time being held in that state at the core for fusion reactions to run continuously. This is called the Lawson criteria, and is hard to achieve. All of the layers of the star above that act as an energy exchanger, converting all the gamma rays and fast neutrons at the core into progressively less energetic wavelengths of light and motion of nuclei (heat) so by the time they reach the surface of the star, that energy is emitted as IR and visible light that heats and powers our planet's biosphere, and can provide photovoltaic energy to us as well. All of our efforts in fusion have been to try and reproduce this process on earth, in a small reactor that can provide practical energy.First I will talk aboutThe first problem with magnetic confinement is fundamental - no matter how strong or well formed the magnetic field containing the plasma is, it will always leak, as positive nuclei or ions spiralling around the magnetic field lines collide and scatter, eventually drifting out of the containment field. The only known solution is to make the reactor larger so the scattering ions take longer to travel to the plasma boundary, and thus more fusion can happen during that time. Pretty brute force.The world's most advanced magnetic confinement fusion power plant is ITER, which, to reduce the ion scattering problem mentioned above, is 6-stories tall and about the same dimension in diameter, containing the mass of 3 Eiffel towers, and it is still not expected to be large enough to contain a plasma long enough to sustain burning and produce continuous energy generation.A more practical problem is how do we extract the energy? Most of the energy in deuterium-tritium fusion reactions is released in fast, high-energy neutrons, which (because they are neutral, and have no electric charge) are not confined by the magnetic field, don't heat up the plasma, and have to be stopped by a thick shield, which then heats up, and can vaporize water to steam in order to power turbines and electrical generators. The problem is the constant bombardment by neutrons makes the shield material degrade with time, and become very radioactive, posing a problem for removal and disposal.Also, deuterium-tritium fusion reactions are currently used because they take place at the lowest energies and at the lowest plasma temperatures of all the possible fusion fuels, and thus are easier to ignite and keep lit. However, tritium is not found naturally in any significant quantities and needs to be manufactured in nuclear reactors. With today's production capacity, we just cannot make enough tritium to power even ITER continuously. We could use better fuels, like Helium-3 or Boron-11, which do not emit neutrons and thus 'burn clean', but the plasma temperature must be much higher and the confinement much better to ignite fusion and sustain it with these fuels. And while Boron-11 is plentiful, Helium-3 is so rare that scientists think that the best source of it is lunar regolith that has been irradiated for billions of years on the moon's surface. Any energy generation infrastructure that requires a regular supply of a moon-based fuel, even as energy dense as He3, will probably never work out.A proposed solution to the Tritium deficit is to construct the shield surrounding the reactor with lithium, which is abundant, and fissions into tritium when struck by neutrons, thereby 'breeding' tritium within the reactor itself. Of course, this comes with its own set of problems of how to capture, purify, and contain the tritium after it is released into the tokamak reaction chamber from the walls.Another issue is that when all of the superconducting magnets in ITER are running at full current (160,000 amps) to create the 13 Tesla toroidal magnetic field (13x that in an MRI machine) and to create the other plasma-shaping and heating fields, they are storing 60 GigaJoules, or around 12 Tons of TNT worth of energy. This is because the 180 kilometers of superconducting Niobium-Tin wires in all these massive magnet coils can carry enormous electrical current when supercooled with liquid helium.More info on the ITER magnets:But, if that cooling fails, the superconductor heats up, quenches, and becomes a normal conductor, and can no longer carry that enormous current. With 160,000 amps suddenly meeting resistance, the coil rapidly vaporizes, and causes a meltdown of the other coils, with a total energy release of 12 tons of TNT. This is very undesirable, especially when those coils are wrapped around a highly radioactive shield that also vaporizes and is expelled into the atmosphere. There are fault-detection systems, but it takes a while to dissipate that amount of energy safely, and there may not be enough time to react quickly enough in the event of a catastrophic magnet coil failure.So, some gotchas left to solve for practical fusion energy generation with magnetic confinement, with some perhaps not so easily solved.Inertial confinement fusionIt also has many of the same problems with energy conversion to electricity, and much worse wear and tear on the shielding from these small nuclear fusion explosions being set off, which also trashes all the precision equipment needed to hold the fuel pellet in the focus of the converging laser beams with extreme accuracy. So, a lot of practical damage control problems before inertial confinement fusion is a practical source of energy generation.While these problems may be solved, practical application is still a very long way off, and currently the main application of inertial confinement fusion is as an experimental testbed for calibrating computer codes used to simulate and design thermonuclear fusion weapons. As horrific as these weapons may be, the simulation codes developed for designing them (sorry maintaining them), are the one of the greatest tools for innovation in fusion energy. There is a hydrodynamics code which simulates the behavior of the fissile (and fusion) materials under extreme conditions of pressure and temperature, as well as transport codes that model neutron transport and scattering in the materials under these conditions, and many other bits and bobs. They are all standard numerical techniques, and the really classified part is the integration and calibration of all these codes with previous nuclear weapon tests from the past, and with these small scale simulations in the present.Electrostatic Confinement FusionBasically you need a vacuum container the size of a basketball and a pump to empty it. You put a small spherical wire cage the size of a golf ball in the center, and a larger wire cage the size of a bowling ball around it. You then pump out all the air, and apply a very large (10,000V) electrical potential between the two cages, with the small negative cathode at the center, and the positive anode at the periphery.Then you open a valve and let in a very small amount of Deuterium gas (commercially available) into the vacuum chamber, and it ionizes in the large voltage potential, the D+ ions in the periphery experience a very strong electric field (100K V/m), and are rapidly accelerated towards the center of the reactor, with enough energy to collide and fuse the deuterium nuclei (no tritium required). This fusion can be measured with an external neutron counter.Theoretically, power generation would be simple, as the fusion products consisting of highly energetic He3 and (few) H3 ions could be decelerated in an electric field and the current from that used to generate electricity directly.Here is ECG Herman’s excellent thesis paper on designing and constructing a Farnsworth Fusor:Although they seem like a obvious winners due to their simplicity and effectiveness, ECF reactors have several things limiting scaling:a) There is a limit to the deuterium gas density before performance degrades, so generation capacity is limited.b) Deuterium ions tend to collide with the wire cage cathode in the center, which absorbs them, heating the cage, and causing energy loss and contamination from metal atoms being dislodged.c) As the deuterium ions oscillate back and forth through the center, each time they change direction, they emit bremsstrahlung radiation, or photons of light, losing energy (this is how your dentist’s x-ray machine works).d) Scattering tends to reduce the nice, radial trajectories of the ions into a Maxwellian distribution over time, reducing the fusion that occurs.There has been work in using electromagnets at the periphery to try and hold a ball of electrons in the center, eliminating the need for a central cage… akaThermonuclear WeaponsIn the Teller-Ulam, two-stage, thermonuclear weapon, a spherical plutonium fission primary (with deuterium-tritium fusion fuel at the core to boost it) is imploded by conventional explosives, the plutonium is crushed far beyond critical density, fissions and detonates. The initial radiation released is contained and focused onto the fusion secondary to implode it, ignite fusion, and detonate it. I just mention this to illustrate the enormous energy needed to really reach the Lawson criteria in a large scale, but nuclear weapons kind of freak me out, so I'm going to refer you to the link to the Wikipedia article about them if you want to read more:Thermonuclear weapon - WikipediaSo, in summary, we should not shut down or stop building today's fission nuclear reactors, as commercial fusion reactors are not only far in the future, but also produce radioactive waste (their shielding, which needs to be periodically replaced), and Tokamaks can melt down catastrophically and explode if there is a cooling failure in the magnet coils during full power operation. They also do not run on seawater, like some say. We need expensive and difficult to produce tritium (which is also radioactive) to ignite fusion at the temperatures and densities that today's tokamak magnetic fields can produce.To advance fusion energy in your career, I think the best fields to study would be physics (classical, electrodynamics, plasma, quantum, nuclear…) and computer science, with a focus on numerical simulation. The actual physical fusion reactors are so expensive and time-consuming to build, test, and operate, that you may only get to iterate designs once or twice in a career, but computer simulations can take us in so many different directions more cheaply and easily by comparison.Perhaps there is some exotic stellarator magnetic confinement design, or advanced Farnsworth electrostatic confinement design that has not been explored in depth, that will turn out to hold the key to fusion energy. Simulation is probably the best first step to find it, unless you have a few billion dollars and several hundred kilometers of Niobium-Tin wire and helium cooling tubing to play with.Brent","3,404 followers",Michael Karnerfors,587,4.6K,9.2M,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-future-of-nuclear-fusion-based-reactors
