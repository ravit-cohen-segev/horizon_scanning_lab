But used benignly, it offers several advantages. Just half a kilogram of fusion fuel would produce the same amount of energy as four million kilogram of fossil fuels. Also, it does not leave behind any highly radioactive waste as churned out by conventional nuclear power stations and is thus considered to be the future of clean energy.Another benefit is that fusion reactors run on something as cheap as deuterium, an isotope of hydrogen—a virtually endless fuel source that can be separated from seawater by electrolysis. Compare this with the complex and expensive methods required to extract uranium-235 from its sources for fission reactors, and it is easy to see why fusion energy is the holy grail of nuclear power research.","68,551 followers",Kanthaswamy Balasubramaniam,1.6K,17.3K,410.8M,https://www.quora.com/Will-Chinas-artificial-sun-be-a-double-edged-sword

4,"Q “Aren't potential fusion reactors very dangerous since they generate so much heat? What if the heat escapes?”The same could be said of any thermal power station, whether heated by fossil fuels, nuclear fission or fusion. However, of these, the uncontrolled release of heat energy is going to be the lowest with fusion power. That’s because the reaction will stop the instant the extreme conditions required to maintain fusion are lost. On current designs, the total amount of thermal energy stored at any one time in the reaction vessel will be relatively low, as it has to be confined to the fuelQ “Aren't potential fusion reactors very dangerous since they generate so much heat? What if the heat escapes?”The same could be said of any thermal power station, whether heated by fossil fuels, nuclear fission or fusion. However, of these, the uncontrolled release of heat energy is going to be the lowest with fusion power. That’s because the reaction will stop the instant the extreme conditions required to maintain fusion are lost. On current designs, the total amount of thermal energy stored at any one time in the reaction vessel will be relatively low, as it has to be confined to the fuel itself in the form of a plasma (those designs that use laser implosion are even less dangerous in that respect). At any one point, the amount of fuel will be very low, so even thought the temperatures are enormous, the very low mass means that the amount of thermal energy present is not that great.The vast majority of any thermal energy stored will be in the steam generation system, and those systems are common to all thermal power generating systems, and we aren’t kept awake at night by the possible danger of an explosive release of steam from that source.In contrast, fission reactors operate at abut 300 C, which might not sound much, but they contain a great deal of mass. Not just the fuel itself, but the moderators, the primary circuit coolant (which is usually water, but can be gas or even liquid sodium in some designs). Some contain large amounts of graphite too, and all have ways of holding the fuel charge itself. What’s more, even if the reactor is turned off, the fuel doesn’t stop creating heat - it will continue to do so in quite large quantities due to decay processes. That’s what happened at Fukushima, when the primary cooling circuit failed, the decay heat from the fuel wasn’t being taken away, and it was that which caused an explosion.What’s worse, with a fission reactor, what is released in such an explosion contains a lot of radioactive isotopes. With a fusion reaction, this simply doesn’t happen; once the fusion process stops no more heat is generated and the level of radioactive isotopes will be vastly lower. Mostly it will be the effects of irradiating the containment vessel with neutrons, but that isn’t going to be spread around the environment. There will be some very light radioactive isotopes released, such as tritium, but the total amounts will be very small and rapidly diluted and will offer a minimal threat.With a fossil fuel thermal power station, there will also be a large mass operating around that 300C level, and where the fuel is burnt, a great deal higher. However, we don’t generally worry about it, but in principle there is a lot of fuel still about which could continue to burn, although the design of such stations is such that there should be no significant chance of more fuel being added to a failed generator.",UNKNOWN,Robert Frost,1.3K,9.4K,195.4M,https://www.quora.com/Will-Chinas-artificial-sun-be-a-double-edged-sword

The fission process is controlled using rods containing a material with high absorption cross-section for thermal neutron, such as hafnium, and cadmium. This prevents the neutrons from being absorbed by other U-235 atoms.This heat is then transferred to water which turns to steam and is used to turn a generator that converts the mechanical (kinetic) energy of the rotor to electrical energy.Below is a typical reactor design in the US known as a Pressurized Water Reactor, PWR. If you notice it utilizes two independent water systems to prevent potential release of radioactive fission byproducts to the environment.Nuclear plants run approximately 18 months before needing to refuel. During the refueling process a third of the fuel is removed and replaced with new fuel. Below is a typical core reload diagram. The reload pattern is critical to ensure that the core heats up evenly and you avoid flux tilt. Flux tilt or power tilt, is a specific type of core power distribution problem that could result from a non-symmetrical variation of core power in one quadrant of the reactor core. So you can see there is a lot of science and mathematics that goes into, not only the design, but the operation of a nuclear power station.Each square represents a fuel assembly that contain uranium oxide pellets.A typical fuel assembly remains in the reactor core for 4.5 years.I worked for over 35 years in the nuclear industry and personally believe that the production of clean reliable electricity using nuclear energy was one of man’s greatest achievements in leaning to control his world for the betterment of mankind.","1,399 followers",Allen Inks,745,2.8K,4.5M,https://www.quora.com/Arent-potential-fusion-reactors-very-dangerous-since-they-generate-so-much-heat-What-if-the-heat-escapes

I will give you the formulae for calculating the nuclear shaped charge explosion needed for the desired thrust—the figures obtained assume it is an external detonation and not one to be contained within the space ship’s design, etc.“The original Project Orion assumed a nuclear pulse drive with an exhaust velocity from 19 to 31 km/s (12 to 19 mps) in typical interplanetary designs, with mega-newtons of thrust.Many spacecraft propulsion drives can achieve one of these or the other, but nuclear pulse rockets are the only proposed technology that could potentially meet the extreme power requirements to deliver both at once.”Specific impulse (Isp) measures how much thrust can be derived from a given mass of fuel, and is a standard figure of merit for rocketry. For any rocket propulsion, since the kinetic energy of exhaust goes up with velocity squared (kinetic energy = ½ mv2), whereas the momentum and thrust goes up with velocity linearly (momentum = mv), obtaining a particular level of thrust (as in a number of g [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G-force ] acceleration) requires far more power each time that exhaust velocity and specific impulse (Isp) is much increased in a design goal. (For instance, the most fundamental reason that current and proposed electric propulsion systems of high Isp tend to be low thrust is due to their limits on available power. Their thrust is actually inversely proportional to Isp if power going into exhaust is constant or at its limit from heat dissipation needs or other engineering constraints.)The Orion concept detonates nuclear explosions externally at a rate of power release which is beyond what nuclear reactors could survive internally with known materials and design. However, since weight is no limitation, an Orion craft can be extremely robust if built intact in outer space in zero gravity. An unmanned craft could tolerate very large accelerations, perhaps 100 g. A human-crewed Orion, however, must use some sort of damping system behind the pusher plate to smooth the instantaneous acceleration to a level that humans can comfortably withstand – typically about 2 to 4 g.The high performance depends on the high exhaust velocity, in order to maximize the rocket's force for a given mass of propellant. The velocity of the plasma debris is proportional to the square root of the change in the temperature (Tc) of the nuclear fireball. Since fireballs routinely achieve ten million degrees Celsius or more in less than a millisecond, they create very high velocities. However, a practical design must also limit the destructive radius of the fireball. The diameter of the nuclear fireball is proportional to the square root of the bomb's explosive yield.The shape of the bomb's reaction mass is critical to efficiency. The original project designed bombs with a reaction mass made of tungsten. The bomb's geometry and materials focused the -rays and plasma from the core of nuclear explosive to hit the reaction mass. In effect each bomb would be a nuclear-shaped charge. A bomb with a cylinder of reaction mass expands into a flat, disk-shaped wave of plasma when it explodes. A bomb with a disk-shaped reaction mass expands into a far more efficient cigar-shaped wave of plasma debris. The cigar shape focuses much of the plasma to impinge onto the pusher-plate.The maximum effective specific impulse, Isp, of an Orion nuclear pulse drive generally is equal to:The smaller the bomb, the smaller each impulse will be, so the higher the rate of impulses and more than will be needed to achieve orbit. Smaller impulses also mean less g shock on the pusher plate and less need for damping to smooth out the acceleration.The optimal Orion drive bomblet yield (for the human crewed 4,000 ton reference design) was calculated to be in the region of 0.15 kt, with approx 800 bombs needed to orbit and a bomb rate of approx 1 per second.In late 1958 to early 1959, it was realized that the smallest practical vehicle would be determined by the smallest achievable bomb yield. The use of 0.03 kt (sea-level yield) bombs would give vehicle mass of 880 tons. However, this was regarded as too small for anything other than an orbital test vehicle and the team soon focused on a 4,000 ton ""base design"". Later studies indicate that the top cruise velocity that can theoretically be achieved by a of the speed of light (0.08-0.1c). But an atomic (fission) Orion can achieve perhaps 9%-11% of the speed of light. A nuclear pulse drive starship powered by Fusion-antimatter catalyzed nuclear pulse propulsion units would be similarly in the 10% range. Whilst pure Matter-antimatter annihilation rockets would theoretically be capable of obtaining a velocity between 50% to 80% of the speed of light. In each case saving fuel for slowing down halves the max. speed. The concept of using a magnetic sail to decelerate the spacecraft as it approaches its destination has been discussed as an alternative to using propellant, this would allow the ship to travel near the maximum theoretical velocity.However, more recently, the use of a magnetic sail to actually power the space ship has bee calculated, and over long distances, the build-up in speed could theoretically reach 98% of the speed of light, without the necessity for a robust shielded space vehicle in the case of ferrying a human crew.A preliminary design for a nuclear pulse unit was actually produced. It proposed the use of a shaped-charge fusion-boosted fission explosive. The explosive was wrapped in a beryllium oxide channel filler, which was surrounded by am uranium radiation mirror. The mirror and channel filler were open ended, and in this open end a flat plate of tungsten propellant was placed. The whole thing was built into a can with a diameter no larger than 6 inches (15 cm) and weighed just over 300 pounds (140 kg) so it could be handled by machinery scaled-up from a soft-drink vending machine and believe it or not, Coca-Cola was consulted on the design.At 1 microsecond after ignition the gamma bomb plasma and neutrons would heat the channel filler and be somewhat contained by the uranium shell. At 2–3 microseconds the channel filler would transmit some of the energy to the propellant, which vaporized. The flat plate of propellant formed a cigar-shaped explosion aimed at the pusher plate.The plasma would cool to 14,000 °C as it traversed the 25 m distance to the pusher plate and then reheat to 67,000 °C as, at about 300 microseconds, it hits the pusher plate and is recompressed. This temperature emits ultraviolet light, which is poorly transmitted through most plasmas. This helps keep the pusher plate cool. The cigar shaped distribution profile and low density of the plasma reduces the instantaneous shock to the pusher plate.The pusher plates thickness would decrease by, approximately, a factor of 6 from the center to the edge so that the net velocity of the inner and outer parts of the plate are the same, even though the momentum transferred by the plasma increases from the center outwards.At low altitudes where the surrounding air is dense gamma scattering could potentially harm the crew without a radiation shield, a radiation refuge would also be necessary on long missions to survive solar flares and MCEs. Radiation shielding effectiveness increases exponentially with shield thickness. On ships with a mass greater than 1,000 tonnes the structural bulk of the ship, its stores along with the mass of the bombs and propellant, would provide more than adequate shielding for the crew. Stability was initially thought to be a problem due to inaccuracies in the placement of the bombs, but it was later shown that the effects would cancel out.The bombs had to be launched behind the pusher plate with enough velocity to explode 20–30 meters beyond it every 1.1 seconds. Numerous proposals were investigated, from multiple guns poking over the edge of the pusher plate to rocket propelled bombs launched from roller coaster tracks, however the final reference design used a simple gas gun to shoot the devices through a hole in the center of the pusher plate.Exposure to repeated nuclear blasts raises the problem of ablation (erosion) of the pusher plate. Calculations and experiments indicated that a steel pusher plate would ablate less than 1 mm, if unprotected. If sprayed with an oil it would not ablate at all (this was discovered by accident; a test plate had oily fingerprints on it and the fingerprints suffered no ablation). The absorption spectra of carbon and hydrogen minimize heating. The design temperature of the shockwave, 67,000 °C, emits ultraviolet light. Most materials and elements are opaque to ultraviolet especially at the 340 MPa pressures the plate experiences. This prevents the plate from melting or ablating.One issue that remained unresolved at the conclusion of the project was whether or not the turbulence created by the combination of the propellant and ablated pusher plate would dramatically increase the total ablation of the pusher plate. According to Freeman Dyson in the 1960s they would have had to actually perform a test with a real nuclear explosive to determine this; with modern simulation technology this could be determined fairly accurately without such empirical investigation.Another potential problem with the pusher plate is that of spalling—shards of metal—potentially flying off the top of the plate. The shock wave from the impacting plasma on the bottom of the plate passes through the plate and reaches the top surface. At that point spalling may occur damaging the pusher plate. For that reason alternative substances, plywood and fiberglass, were investigated for the surface layer of the pusher plate and thought to be acceptable. If the conventional explosives in the nuclear bomb detonate but a nuclear explosion does not ignite, a dud, shrapnel could strike and potentially critically damage the pusher plate. True engineering tests of the vehicle systems were thought to be impossible because several thousand nuclear explosions could not be performed in any one place. Experiments were designed to test pusher plates in nuclear fireballs and long-term tests of pusher plates could occur in space. Several of these tests almost flew.But the main unsolved problem for a launch from the surface of the Earth was thought to be nuclear fall out. Any explosions within the magnetosphere would carry fissiles back to earth unless the spaceship was launched from a polar region, possibly on a barge in the higher regions of the Arctic; or constructed in situ in low earth orbit. An initial launching explosion of conventional high explosive would significantly reduce fallout, subsequent detonations would be in the air and therefore much cleaner. Antarctic is not viable and would require legal changes as the continent is presently an international wildlife preserve. Orion-style nuclear pulse rockets could be launched from above the magnetosphere so that charged ions of fallout in its exhaust plasma are not trapped by the Earth's magnetic field and are not returned to Earth.From many smaller detonations combined the fallout for the entire launch of a 6,000 short ton (5,500 metric ton) Orion is equal to the detonation of a typical 10 megaton (40 petajoule) nuclear weapon as an airburst, therefore most of its fallout would be the comparatively dilute delayed fall out. Assuming the use of nuclear explosives with a high portion of total yield from fission, it would produce a combined fallout total similar to the surface burst yield of the Mike Shot of Operation Ivy, a 10.4 Megaton device detonated in 1952. Historical above-ground nuclear weapon tests included 189 megatons of fission yield and caused average global radiation exposure per person peaking at 0.11 mSv/a in 1963, with a 0.007 mSv/a residual in modern times, superimposed upon other sources of exposure, primarily natural background radiation, which averages 2.4 mSv/a globally but varies greatly, such as 6 mSv/a in some high-altitude cities.However, restrictions of the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty would not apply to a possible Project Daedalus fusion microexplosion rocket. Daedalus class systems use pellets of 1 gram or less, ignited by particle or laser beams, to produce very small fusion explosions with a maximum explosive yield of 10–20 tons of TNT equivalent.The launch of such an Orion nuclear bomb rocket from the ground or low Earth orbit would generate an EMP (electromagnetic pulse) that could cause significant damage to c...","29,755 followers",Tomaž Vargazon,6.8K,7.6K,248.6M,https://www.quora.com/Will-Chinas-artificial-sun-be-a-double-edged-sword

I suspect that these gammas will mostly deposit their energy thermally (rather than kinetically) and will do the most damage to the shield, and perhaps more crucially, since they are weakly interacting many of these gammas will pass right through the shield and get to the fleshy goodness in the passenger compartment - potentially killing the passengers.So your ‘limiting factor’ (if my hypothesis is correct) is going to be some level of prompt gamma flux which begins ionizing a large amount of the lubricant on the shield, and surpasses its ability to attenuate them. Gamma production is directly proportional to the number of reactions (ie number of atoms split), so the reaction will have to be quite small (I would imagine a megaton-range device would be out of the question).",2 followers,Richard Muller,1.7K,2.3K,201.9M,https://www.quora.com/Will-Chinas-artificial-sun-be-a-double-edged-sword
