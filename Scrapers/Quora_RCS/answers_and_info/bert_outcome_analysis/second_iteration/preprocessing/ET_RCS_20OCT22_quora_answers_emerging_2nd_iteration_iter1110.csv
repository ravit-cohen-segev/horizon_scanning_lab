Be it Home Automation, Industrial Automation, Health Monitoring, Smart Environment leading to automation of daily tasks to better monitoring of devices, saves Money and gives us better quality of life.An IoT platform is characteristically complex networking environment. It is not that easy to decide what platform would be suitable for your business as there are many factors involved in it.The major factors are listed below:Some of the platforms will help your business save money, and some will help save time. Due to disparate devices and sensors from arrange of vendors, the information remains discrete and as a result,the IoT landscape looks fragmented. Engaging different devices and applications may help businesses make the most of the data available and generate deep insights. But to handle such complexities, a business needs to have a platform that allows application development, device monitoring and data management. An IoT solution allows the business to provide sensor based services.The world is getting smarter as many more smart devices are being rolled out. Connected devices on smart platforms have the ability toun lock opportunities that have been unheard of till today. Deploying the right IoT platform can automate your business process and save a lot of time and money.","51,495 followers",Elena Ledoux,27.6K,6.4K,99.3M,https://www.quora.com/How-can-IOT-and-BigData-help-in-improving-life-of-a-common-Indian-man

Whether it’s tIoT and Bigdata have come a long way in no time and the technological implementations of these concept too have been able to show that these are the future technologies that would bring the entire world together.The Internet of Things (IoT) has the power to change our world. And while we are starting to see its incredible impact, we are still very much at the beginning of the transformation journey. Soon every device you own – and nearly every object you can imagine – will be connected to the Internet. Whether it’s through your phone, wearable tech or everyday household objects, the Internet of Things (IoT) will connect us in ways we can’t even imagine yet.The Internet of Things represents devices, buildings, vehicles and more with sensors, software and network connectivity built into them. These things are connected to the Internet and to each other transmitting data and information to the people who use them.As you can imagine, life in ten years will look materially different from how it looks in 2017 as the pace of technology change accelerates, thanks in large part to the coming boom of the Internet of Things.According to Gartner, Inc., there were more connected devices than people in 2008 and in the next few years that number will rise past 20 billion.Self-transportationSensors, software and connectivity have changed vehicle technology with one of the most excited innovations being the self-driving car.These let the vehicle automatically drive on open roads and in traffic. Connected software inside the car sends information back to engineers, which helps programmers make upgrades that make the cars safer and more efficient.The hope for self-driving cars is to prevent accidents and traffic-related deaths, save time for commuters, relieve traffic jams and save money on fuel and lost productivity.ManufacturingConnected devices are being used in manufacturing to cut costs and increased efficiency and productivity.HealthcareWearable technology and fitness trackers have already proven to be a huge healthcare market. These smart devices allow people to take an active role in their health management.CommunicationCommunication is one of the main areas in which the Internet of things is having many positive effects. Mobile and wearable devices are able to talk to each other by sending data to other devices, thus everyday communication and syncing personal information between devices has become easier.EnergySaving energy is a goal of high importance as the population continues to increase and natural resources diminish. The concept of the Smart Grid refers to an electrical grid equipped with digital technology that allows for communication between the utility and the costumers through connected devices such as thermostats, gas meters and other appliances. This way power can be drawn at times when power is not in high demand and therefore cheaper.AgricultureThe Internet of things is having an impact on the farming industry as well. John Deere machines have sensors that collect data on air and soil temperature, wind speed, humidity, solar radiation and rainfall while smart watering systems save water by detecting leaks and watering only the most needed places in the fields. Sensors are being used to detect pests capable of destroying crops, which reduces the frequency and use of pesticides.Smart HomesOne of the most common ways the Internet of things is changing our lives is in our homes. Thermostats, alarm systems, smoke detectors, refrigerator, lighting and entertainment systems and even the doorbell can be connected, controlled and monitored from a mobile device.LogisticsEliminating waste and pollutants is a benefit of the union of logistics and the Internet of things. Video sensor-embedded stoplights adjust their green and red lights according to the time of day and the positions of cars. This reduces congestion, smog and idling vehicles, which accounts for around 17 percent of fuel consumption in urban areas.While these connected technologies take aWith the entire world connected, rises the concern for need for bigger data storage and also the protocols to be able to manage the large amount of data because we are talking about laying the entire world into data sets.In simple terms,If i were to put this in a simpler way:“IoT is the senses, Big Data is the fuel, and artificial Intelligence is the brain to realize the future of a smart connected world.”The end goal is to harness the data coming from sensors(or devices connected to internet) and other contextual information to discover patterns and correlations in real-time to positively impact the usage of the available information provided by IoT. Existing Big Data technologies need to be augmented to effectively store, manage and extract value from continuous streams of incoming data from the internet.Though Big Data tools promise security over large data sets, its not able to keep up with the required standard yet. With respect to the amount of data that goes over the internet through millions of computers/and other devices connected together globally, the security concerns have been major. In the coming years we can definitely expect to be able to narrow the pipeline for error and expect IoT alongwith Big Data to have more prominence in our life and make it easier to connect with each other and remove boundaries that have existed for centuries. The Internet of things continues to rapidly evolve and our everyday lives are along for the ride.","83,116 followers",Anna Sharudenko,9.9K,199,26.9M,https://www.quora.com/How-can-IOT-and-BigData-help-in-improving-life-of-a-common-Indian-man

Sleep 8 Hours a NightNo ‘ifs’, ‘and’s’, or ‘buts’, you must get 8 hours of HIGH quality sleep everynight if you want to have the best life possible.Sure, you might sacrifice a few hours of productivity, however, if you look at any credible study, the research clearly shows that (unless you have a rare DEC2 genetic mutation) you need 5 sleep cycles to perform at your best.Sleep cycles occur every 90 minutes and, since it takes the average person 20 minutes to fall asleep, going to bed 8 hours before you need to be awake is ideal for optimal performance.5 Sleep Cycles x 90 Minutes = 7.5 Hours + 20 Minutes to Fall Asleep = 7 Hours 50 Minutes + 10 Minute buffer = 8 hours2. Make Sure You Sleep WELLJust because you are sleeping 8 hours doesn’t mean that you are getting 8 hours of quality sleep.To ensure that you are maximizing your “Z’s” I suggest that you:3. Exercise DailyThis might seem a little cliche, but it’s the single most important habit to ensure a high quality of life.If I don’t exercise daily (typically by lifting weights, doing yoga, or riding my bike), I can tell.I’m tired, ornery, and generally a bastard to be around.You need to get exercise as frequently as possible.Your body evolved to move so MOVE baby MOVE!4. MeditateAgain, this is cliche but it works.Taking 10 minutes every morning to sit in silence and simply reconnect with my breath and body has done miracles for my quality of life.Meditation has been scientifically shown to reduce stress, promote empathy, spark creativity, and improve overall well being tremendously.5. LaughThis is a big one that people often forget about.Laughter truly is the best medicine and starting out your mornings with a short stand-up comedy or a few clips from a funny talk show can put you into a positive mood that will permeate the rest of your day.I recommend that you find 2–3 comedians that you really love and purchase all of their stand-ups.Then, when you are cooking breakfast, play the show in the background and let the laughter roll.Oh, speaking of breakfast6. Eat BreakfastSeriously, I know a lot of you are probably avid practitioners of Intermittent Fasting, and that’s great, but unless you are counting calories and know for a fact that you are still getting enough fuel despite your fasting, you need to eat breakfast.It will charge you up for the rest of the day and prevent early afternoon “Hangriness”.7. Get Out in Nature (Preferably Near a Large Body of Water)Getting out in nature has been shown time and time again to be a HUGE factor in a person’s overall happiness and well being.We’ve evolved over the past 6,000 years to be surrounded by nature, not concrete.Make it a priority to get out in nature for at least 30 minutes a day.You won’t regret it.8. Connect with Someone You Love Every DayThis is a simple habit that will instantly and dramatically improve your quality of life.Humans are inherently social creatures and, despite the massive technological advancements we’ve recently experienced, we are more disconnected and solitary than ever before.Everyday I challenge you to connect with someone you love.Whether you Skype your mom, sit down for coffee with your girlfriend, or go hang out with amigos at the bar, spend at least 10 hours a week really connecting with people that you care about.9. Express GratitudeEvery single day ask yourself the question, “What do I have to be grateful for?”If you answer that question each morning when you wake up and each night before you go to sleep, I promise your life will change forever.10. RelaxDo something fun everyday.Play guitar, play video games, read a good book, walk by the beach.Just do something that will make you happy and help you relax.Your mind, body, and spirit will thank you for it.Stay Grounded,Learn more about my work and mission by visiting my Quora profile",UNKNOWN,Qiaochu Yuan,2.9K,310,4.3M,https://www.quora.com/How-can-IOT-and-BigData-help-in-improving-life-of-a-common-Indian-man

It’s in what you are receptive to. It’s in the moment being just right. It’s in what you need to see or hear.Learning is not in the lesson.

I will point out some instances where you can see the advantage of a common man's life. First of all, the main advantage of a common man is privacy and freedom. We all wish to have privacy rather than being surrounded by paparazzis. A common man can do many things that a celebrity can't do. For example, if a celebrity walks down a road they will be surrounded by people taking pictures asking for autographs etc. Even if they don't like being surrounded by people they can't be rude to them because it would affect their celebrity status. On the other hand a common man does not have these problems he would barely be noticed by anyone. We all like to go to different restaurants and try different dishes. But a celebrity can't do this mainly because of privacy issues, security reasons etc. They can't eat roadside foods even if they wish to have cause they would be surrounded by people taking pictures of them and it will become a big news which is annoying.They would be noticed everywhere they go. They can't go to a bar, a beach, a supermarket, a theatre etc. Every part of their lives would be known by the public which is very disturbing. They can't go on a road trip and enjoy like a common man because people like us surround them. In other words a common man's life is ruled by him or lived according to him, but a celebrity is sometimes controlled by the public.But this doesn't mean that all of this is impossible for a celebrity but the problem is lack of privacy, security reasons etc. Another thing is social media attacks. They face many attacks like provoking comments or rumours about them but a normal man can stay peacefully and doesn't have to worry about all these things. We have seen many celebrity suicides. Some celebrities have accepted that they have been in depression by the celebrity life. Some celebrities said that they hated the celebrity life and wished they got back the normal life. Justin Bieber once said that he becomes depressed while being in the hotel room because he can't go out and take a walk because he will be surrounded by paparazzis. Everywhere they go they will be surrounded by people asking for pictures, autographs etc. Justin Bieber said that he won't be taking pictures with people anymore and if u see him somewhere don't come asking for a picture. He says people treat him like a Zoo animal and he don't owe everybody a picture. Daniel Craig once said that he wanted to shout at people taking pictures of him having food at a restaurant but he can't do it. But celebrity life has many advantages too. Most of the celebrities are very rich and they can enjoy all the luxuries of life. The money earned by a common man in his lifetime can be earned by a celebrity at a young age. They get special privileges and they are respected by people wherever they go which a normal person doesn't get. They are role models to many people even a sentence they say can inspire many people. And when they die they would be remembered by everyone but it's opposite in the case of a common man.On conclusion, its the way you see things. This was my opinion but if you wish to have a celebrity life then go for it. Both the sides have advantages and disadvantages. Try to be happy in life as life is too short even if you are a normal person or a celebrity. And we all should understand the fact that we don't take anything with us when we die. So try to live life to the fullest and enjoy every moment of it even if you are a celebrity or a normal person.",264 followers,Surojit Mahato,3.3K,0,0,https://www.quora.com/How-can-IOT-and-BigData-help-in-improving-life-of-a-common-Indian-man

Slowly, the answers written by top Quorans started to fascinate me.Specially, the English language part.I so wished to write like them. I began writing in April 2017, but most of my answers got collapsed. My poor language skills and lack of knowledge somehow hindered my writing. Disappointed, I continued the journey as a mere reader.However, things changed rapidly in October ’17, and I was hit by severe depression after going through a series of traumatic experiences which, for obvious reasons, I can't talk much about.Note that I'm using the word ‘depression’ here with utmost responsibility.I gained considerable weight. I stopped going out, meeting friends, and spent sleepless nights. At times, I would go without eating for days.Never in my life had I felt that miserable before.The worst part was that I was away from my family. Having lost interest in everything, and with no one to share my feelings with, I felt helpless. I was stuck in a vicious circle.Unable to take it anymore, I reached out for help. My best friend, while suggesting different things, also encouraged me to have a go at writing. I was initially reticent but finally conceded.Until November, I had answered 5–6 questions.Since November, I began writing regularly.To my amazement, I started getting hooked on writing.Quora kept me engaged and, most importantly, happy. The kind and encouraging words of fellow Quorans really made a world of difference in my attitude towards life.I thank them all.Within days, I recovered beyond my imagination.I would not say Quora changed my life.It rather restored my ‛life’.I have become the person I was before- Happy.And I'm grateful to this platform for that.:-)","284,818 followers",James Altucher,7.2K,878,91.6M,https://www.quora.com/How-can-IOT-and-BigData-help-in-improving-life-of-a-common-Indian-man

Came back after 45 mins. I took a shower and got dressed.I sat down in a corner of my house, closed my eyes, and started focusing on my breaths.

Putting pen to paper helps you break the situation down, and take a look at it in a different mindset.I recently started a gratitude journal. Every day I write 3 things I am grateful for. Even in the worse of times there is something we all are grateful for. That’s what keeps us going, at least for me it does.So, if you are thinking about journaling do it! Start small, 3–5 mins a day. Just jot random thoughts down. If you are thinking or obsessing about something, write it down. Or answer a question on Quora that addresses the issue that is bothersome.A lot of chaos and madness can be managed through journaling.Inside the mind of Chris can be interesting at times!Take care!",288 followers,Deepak Mehta,701,3.9K,105.2M,https://www.quora.com/How-can-IOT-and-BigData-help-in-improving-life-of-a-common-Indian-man

No more waking up on a Tuesday morning and sitting in traffic in the rain; you’ll just be waking up comfortably to a cleared sky with no work to do and an entire day to relax!But after spending hundreds of days relaxing, it won’t be quite so great, not having anything to do. Boredom will probably set in and you’ll find yourself wandering about gorgeous landscapes searching for something meaningful to do.But we’re resilient. Humans already (mostly) live in a world without individual biological purpose (most of us here take food and safety for granted).We still have the advancement of our species, however, and this is something important. We also have the individual struggles that come with trying to think of the right thing to say.Imagine a world where, when you wondered about something to make someone feel happy, Google would drop the answer right inside your brain? No effort involved. The words aren’t yours… they’re an AI’s.I don’t believe that AI will destroy the world or become self-aware like many predict. I believe that AI will slowly conquer every struggle that humans deal with, and so, slowly conquer every visage (aspect) of purpose.That isn’t to say that there isn’t hopeIronically, that hope fades a bit right alongside this answer, as the AI named “The Quora Distribution Algorithm” slowly stops spreading this answer to your feeds…",448 followers,Joey Carmello,20.9K,0,0,https://www.quora.com/How-can-IOT-and-BigData-help-in-improving-life-of-a-common-Indian-man
16,"I was asked to answer. I will quote the first lines out of my IoT M2M Cookbook:1 Why Did I Write the IoT / M2M Cookbook?I have worked in the Wireless M2M industry for more than a quarter of a century. Twenty-five years ago, we didn’t even have a word for “M2M” or “IoT”. We developed Machine to Machine devices without knowing that decades later these creations would be called “M2M devices”. Twenty-five years ago, the GSM network for wireless data communication did not exist. I took my first steps in wireless data communication with Frequency Shift Keying (FSK) on Private Mobile Radios (PMR). OI was asked to answer. I will quote the first lines out of my IoT M2M Cookbook:1 Why Did I Write the IoT / M2M Cookbook?I have worked in the Wireless M2M industry for more than a quarter of a century. Twenty-five years ago, we didn’t even have a word for “M2M” or “IoT”. We developed Machine to Machine devices without knowing that decades later these creations would be called “M2M devices”. Twenty-five years ago, the GSM network for wireless data communication did not exist. I took my first steps in wireless data communication with Frequency Shift Keying (FSK) on Private Mobile Radios (PMR). On PMRs we achieved communication speeds of 3600 bits per second. A little later we started using public analogue trunked radios. These trunked radio systems provided local terrestrial wireless networks on FSK. Years ago, the last public analogue trunked radio network in Germany was taken out of service. GSM jumped in with its Short Message Service (SMS) and Circuit Switched Data (CSD). CSD provided us 9600 bits per second. We could use SMS and CSD for straightforward countrywide data communication. Later on, GSM roaming offered us worldwide data communication. Today, GSM/GPRS is being gradually phased out and is being replaced by 3G and 4G technology. .....What has happened in those 20 years?GPSMany GPS modules still list 21 mA to 35 mA in the data sheet. 5 mA at Full tracking is already more than 80 % lower than other modules in the GPS market. Let’s see what will happen in the next 20 years. Perhaps Europe will have to be Galileo. :-)GSM20 years ago the power consumption was 20 mA. A while later we moved to 5 mA. Today we reached estimated 1 mA. The current peaks have shrunk from 2,5 Ampere to 1,8 Ampere. The end result is a much longer standby time on battery than two decades ago. GSM / GPS trackers profit from the lower power consumption in both wireless technologies. They have become smaller and smaller and the standby time is much longer today.MyselfThe finished IoT M2M Cookbook is a living work, because I plan to offer updates. Some updates are triggered by consulting projects; other updates are triggered by questions from readers or customers of wireless modules and antennas.  The third reason for updates is LTE. In US we will get a sunset of GSM. AT&T will go ahead with UMTS (HSPA/WCDMA) only. In Europe Swisscom in Switzerland will sunset GSM and replace it with LTE and UMTS. LTE has already a chapter in my book. However, in summer 2014 there were not a lot of details about LTE-M, LTE-MTC, NB-LTE and further LTE topics in the public domain. It is still not clear which cellular operator will install which LTE technology. LTE is a patchwork of more than 40 frequency bands across the world and no LTE module will be able to cover all bands. We will have LTE modules with selected bands for regions.The FutureAs long as I write cookbooks, recipes and consulting I do not plan to retire. I love to share my knowledge and experience and I am always glad if some electronic engineers with no or less experience in radios and antennas move within a few months from an idea to a prototype and later on to mass production.And if you have a need for wireless modules, antennas, consulting or development for your IoT M2M application, then to not hesitate to drop an email to harald.naumann (at) gsm - modem .de. I will be glad to support your IoT M2M project as well.","15,495 followers",Vinay Chaddha,1K,925,3.9M,https://www.quora.com/How-can-IOT-and-BigData-help-in-improving-life-of-a-common-Indian-man

So your intelligent smartphone has decided that you need to wake up half an hour early to be on time at work. This is IoT for you!Internet of Things (IoT) also referred to as Internet of Everything (IoE) is one of the four pillars of digital transformation that will eventually define and transform the way of life as we know it. Internet of Things is already being applied and will in future become indispensable to every industry that exists. IoT will enable and automate the process of data sharing for it is the network of physical devices, vehicles, home appliances, and other items embedded with electronics, software, sensors, actuators, and connectivity which enables these things to connect, collect and exchange data.IoT enabled devices have the ability to communicate and interact over the Internet, while being remotely monitored and controlled. IoT gets its name for it is a convergence of multiple technologies, such as real-time analytics, machine learning, commodity sensors, and embedded systems. All the data that is collected is stored on cloud and then secured. Machine learning and data analytics then comes into play, which can then make even a ‘dumb’ device ‘intelligent’.Apart from home automation or ‘smart homes’ as they are popularly known, Internet of Things has various use cases in the following areas:HealthcareLogisticsAgricultureManufactureIoT can also be used for traffic management, environmental monitoring and even disaster management to predict earthquakes, forest fires and Tsunamis.Challenges Faced While Implementing IoTAlthough IoT has numerous applications, it doesn’t come without challenges. Data privacy and security are major concerns when it comes to IoT. To clean, process and interpret the vast amount of data and to store this data in a secured manner is a major task for IoT applications especially in a country like India. Security is the biggest concern in adopting IoT. Cyberattacks are likely to become an increasingly physical (rather than simply virtual) threat with the advent Internet of things. Legacy infrastructure is another issue that arises when it comes to IoT, as patches to bugs found in the core operating system often do not reach users of older and lower-price devices. There is also a lack of a clear business model when it comes to IoT, which is hindering the implementation of IoT on a large scale.","135,257 followers",Hector Quintanilla,582,1.2K,88.3M,https://www.quora.com/How-can-IOT-and-BigData-help-in-improving-life-of-a-common-Indian-man
