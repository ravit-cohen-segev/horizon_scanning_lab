Still, many people, including Congress, would like to know for certain if inertial confinement fusion will ultimately work and actually produce net energy from fusion. To answer this question, in the final few years on underground nuclear testing, both LANL and LLNL designed a series of test shots called Halite-Centurion. Halite-Centurion series shots were fusion related add on shots piggy-backed onto shots already on the schedule. These shots were designed to utilize a small portion of the X-rays produced from the primary of an experimental device through a line of sight to a remote fusion experiment housed some distance away in the underground experimental test canister. Lasers and Ion-beam fusion drivers such as were available at that time (1980 - 1992) could not provide the driver energy required to produce fusion ignition - but X-rays from a remotely ignited fission device could provide the driver energy needed (>20 MJ energy delivered into a spot of about 2 mm in a time of less than 3 nanoseconds) .Halite-Centurion fusion experiments in the Nevada desert worked and reliably and repeatedly and produced full fusion ignition of small sub-gram samples of DT fuel (in small filled spheres). These experiments were once classified but DOE allowed senior scientist Dr. John Lindl to declassify and reveal about half of the fusion related project information.Inertial confinement fusion is the only form of fusion that has to date been proven to work in actual field experiments (not just in computer simulations). Halite-Centurion series shots were fusion related add on shots piggy-backed onto DOE-DOD shots already on the schedule. These shots were designed to utilize a small portion of the X-rays produced from the primary of an experimental device through a line of sight to ignite a remote fusion experiment housed remotely some distance away in the underground experimental test canister.Once classified Halite-Centurion test shots experimentally proved that small DT filled spheres could be ignited and brought to full fusion ignition using an intense beam of X-rays.ICF fusion has already beenIf fusion drivers are designed that sufficiently resemble the characteristics and performance of X-ray driver used in Halite-Centurion experiments, there is no question that full fusion ignition with fusion energy gain will be practically achieved. Practical fusion is not a matter of guesswork or conjecture but has already been------While wanting to avoid excessive controversy, I would like to point out the following historical facts.Ivy-Mike fission-fusion ICF technology worked the very first time it was tried in 1952.Ivy-Mike ICF fission-fusion technology has historically never failed to work while producing fusion energy with enormous energy gain.Fission-fusion ICF technology was the basis of the first thermonuclear weapons in the US arsenal. Adapting fission-fusion technology to be pure hybrid DT-DD fusion opens up many new applications in economical power generation.Fission-fusion technology worked the first time it was tried and produced huge amounts of net energy with engineering fusion gain not only greater than one but greater than 10^5 or 100,000X (and has never failed in over 800 underground tests at the Nevada Test Site).Rather than placing our faith in scaling laws while we build ever larger and more expensive MCF fusion experiments while trying to achieve break even energy generation -Why not go back to the field and adapt proven Inertial Confinement Fusion technology to operate as pure fusion, employing a modern fusion driver (laser or particle accelerator) capable of delivering in excess of 20 MJ to the fusion capsule while avoiding use of a fission primary?Why not adapt and modify working ICF fusion technology that has never failed in the field rather than sink all current fusion funding into Magnetic Confinement Fusion approaches which in hundreds of MCF fusion devices around the world and in hundreds of thousands of shots has consistently failed to even once produce break-even fusion energy?References -NY Times article published at the time of Halite-Centurion field tests -The following document contains what Senior LLNL researcher John Lindl was permitted to release publicly regarding Halite-Centurion ICF by DOE“Development of the Indirect Drive Approach to Inertial Confinement Fusion and the Target Physics Basis for Ignition and Gain” John Lindl. Page: 3937. AIP Physics of Plasma. American Institute of Physics, 14 June 1995.——————-Establishing and then permanently keeping fusion conditions continuously for indefinite spans of time is the dream of Magnetic Confinement devices like tokamaks, but after decades of experience with over 200 historical tokamak experiments, it has so far has not proved possible to keep fusion conditions allowing any significant production of fusion power for longer than a maximum of around 5 seconds (The Joint European Torus Experiment in England still holds the record for longest continuous plasma burn while generating more than 1% of designed full power). in 1997, JET produced 16 mega watts of fusion power while consuming a total input power of 24 mega watts for about a second and 5 MW for 5 seconds – momentarily achieving a 65% ratio of fusion energy output to the energy input that must be drawn from an external source to power the tokamak experiment and bring the fusion plasma to fusion conditions.To date fusion machines engineered to produce continuous plasma burns have proven only to be good for intermittent energy production for a few seconds. Why not find greater long term overall system reliability in practical fusion systems that only have to achieve fusion conditions for a few nanoseconds to work (as per their design) and form a reliable power plant technology from it?Picture of a light ion beam molten salt cooled Inertial Confinement Fusion power plantMany of the leading current fusion systems propose to operate in this ""pulse mode"" style of operation.

Gen 4 Prototypes may give us vital options for low carbon energy.Generation 4 reactors can be much safer, cleaner, cheaper and smaller than current PWR, Pressurizes Water Reactors with Metal fuel rods containing enriched Uranium fuel. Though these reactors are very safe they are highly inefficient, creating to much waste and leaving most of the Uranium fuel wasted when fuel rods are replaced.Generation 4 reactors could use different fuels like nuclear waste, mining waste and even unused weapons material.China is building Next Generation fission reactors using some US research and designs. As US industries and government will not build new prototypes. China has just started operation of a prototype Gen 4, gas cooled, pebble bed reactor. The spherical pebbles use highly heat resistant materials such as carbons, ceramic, silicon carbides and other materials able to withstand heat over 1000 degrees. Heat that would destroy current PWR reactors.China will likely soon have a Molten Salt Reactor, MSR, possibly with Thorium fuel. And sodium-cooled WAve reactor using waste depleted Uranium as fuel. A type of breeder reactor. Breeder reactors can actually produce more nuclear fuel. Some breeder reactors have been developed but are not common.MSR reactors are potentially revolutionary with very high efficiency, little waste, very safe, small, possibly using efficient factory production of small and modular reactors. The US has a number of these designs and has done plenty of past research. Much of which China is using to build there own MSR reactors. One prototype should be in operation soon. With China also breaking records with Fusion reactors the US is being left far behind.A Chinese research Fusion reactor has produced plasma heated to 3 times the temp of the sun for 100 seconds. Temperatures that would melt any known material. Or turn them into plasma itself. The US and China are part of the international ITER Fusion reactor in France. Costing over $10 billion and it should be completed in 2025. But it is very far from producing cheap, low carbon power. Generation power could be far cheaper and sooner.China and India have the world largest growth in energy demand. Large renewable projects are not able to keep up. India and China are planning over 50 new reactors to meet demand. India has large Thorium deposits and want to use that to fuel its new reactors.The world needs safer nuclear technology. And the US should be leading the world. The US has the technology and resources. But large coal, gas and oil companies have powerful lobby groups to stop development.Current US reactors should remain online as long as they are cost-effective and safe. Closing down working reactors is hugely wasteful. And the US needs this vital low carbon energy. But they should be replaced with Gen 4 reactors if prototypes are successful.At the moment prototypes are vital. And could be an important option for low carbon energy.PWR reactors are complicated and need huge amounts of safety features to keep them safe. That makes them very expensive. Most of the expensive and dirty enriched Uranium fuel becomes waste. Years of high grade nuclear waste can now be used as fuel.But the US does not need to build Gen 4 reactors.

But climate change is urgent and we can eliminate the problem with wind and solar in less time than we can find out the answer to whether fusion will be commercialized ever. We can eliminate it even faster if we take a serious economic look at efficiency, and save as much money as possible compared to what we spend today to produce energy.Most of the time when people promote fusion these days they are not interested in the intellectual progress, or the ultimate potential.

The water will be separated from oxygen and then blasted with neutron to make fuels like deuterium and tritium.While the fuel will be extremely efficient and cheap but the reactors may cost so much that they can not be built to provide the low carbon energy we need. It may be 2035 by the time a working, power production reactor could be produced.Also with these reactors, the neutron will damage the structure and components of the reactor. So expensive components may need to be replaced regularly.The plasma produced by the reactor will be more than twice as hot as the sun. So it can not be in contact with any part of the reactor. The plasma would melt any components.On the bright side a blanket of molten salt surrounding the reactor could collect the neutrons and heat energy without damaging the reactor. Also the molten salts could contain radioactive material bonded to the salt. The radioactive material, possibly nuclear waste could be broken down by the neutrons and burning them up to produce heat energy and more neutrons. So a fusion reactor could be used to destroy high-grade nuclear waste.Such a reactor with molten salt could produce both fusion and fission power. Without any risk of a meltdown. The supply of neutrons could be stopped immediately from the fusion reactor. Producing very cheap power, destroying waste and protecting the reactor from neutron damage. The molten salt could quickly be drained from the reactor to a low neutron cooling tank.But for the foreseeable future nuclear fusion reactors will be too expensive to build.For a more immediate supply of vital low carbon energy, we could produce MSR fission reactors instead. MSR reactors could be in production within 10 years. They can also be fueled by nuclear waste, mining waste and unused weapons material.MSR reactors use salt for cooling and to carry the nuclear fuel through the reactor core. Bonded to the salts. Unlike current, common PWR reactors MSRs do not need very high-pressure water, need inefficient fuel rods that could melt or expensive enriched Uranium as fuel. Molten salt reactors can work at much higher temperatures with no risk of exploding or meltdowns. If the temperature gets to hot the liquid salt and fuel is automatically drained into a low neutron cooling tank.MSR reactors could also run on Thorium as a fuel. Thorium is cheaper amd more common than Uranium. It does not need expensive and dirty enrichment producing tons of nuclear waste. The Thorium can be completely burnt up leaving much less waste. And the fissile products produced by the reactor can also be burnt up. Producing more energy. Some very useful products can be removed from the salt mix.

It is remarkable that we (as a species) are even attempting it and more remarkable that we may well succeed.People seem to think that fusion is relatively easy, but it really isn’t. Even in the core of the sun, fusion generates only a small amount of net heat. A cubic metre of the sun’s fusing core only generates around 275 watts. That’s less energy output than we give off as body heat for an equivalent volume. The reason why the sun is so hot is because there are hundreds of thousands of miles of insulation (in the form of hot gas contained by gravity) around this heating centre.There’s a reason stars burn for billions of years, they really only burn slowly.Now consider the conditions at the core of the sun - 250 billion atmospheres, 15 million degrees (K or C doesn’t matter at this scale). And that is sufficient to make a piddly amount of heat per cubic metre. Scaled down to operations that would fit on Earth, that’s not going to cut it for power generation. You’d get more power out of a single large solar panel in good conditions. (That might seem odd but consider the sheer size of the sun, even “just” the core region).What’s more, we can’t achieve those sorts of pressures so we need much higher temperatures before we even start fusion; closer to 100 million degrees. We then need to surround this heating zone with the kind of insulation a few hundred thousand miles worth of mind-bogglingly dense gas and plasma provides (using superpowered magnets), and then we have to extract sensible energy without causing the whole reaction to stall and still end up with enough energy to outweigh the inevitable energy losses.I hope this gives you an idea of what an achievement creating a working fusion power plant will be. It should be considered like the Manhattan project or Apollo programme but wa...","3,657 followers",Brent Oster,3.6K,357,1.8M,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-delay-in-bringing-online-fusion-reactors-for-energy-production

19,"Oddly enough, even the interior of the Sun is not hot enough for classical fusion. It depends on “quantum tunneling” and, even then, happens with such a low frequency that the power generated, in the core of the Sun, is about 276 watts per cubic meter - ABOUT THE SAME ENERGY DENSITY AS A DECENT COMPOST HEAP.So even if we managed to duplicate the conditions at the center of the Sun, we would have an energy source that was too diffuse to use to make power.So there is the challenge, create conditions much more severe than the center of the Sun, on Earth, without destroying the system components (Oddly enough, even the interior of the Sun is not hot enough for classical fusion.

This is like containing jello with rubberbands - no matter what we’ve done, the plasma has leaked out too quickly. Even with massive, superconducting magnets cooled with liquid helium.The science is that we need to make it bigger. The bigger it is the longer it will take the plasma to leak out. No great leap needed here. The problem is that ITER, the experiment that is big enough that we expect to reach break even, is going to cost at least 22 billion dollars. It is expensive keeping the coldest place in the solar system (liquid helium temperature) just a few feet from the hottest - orders of magnitude hotter than the center of the Sun.And this is for a proof of principle experiment. ITER is not a working reactor. There are huge engineering problems left related to neutron economy and breeding enough tritium, heat removal, protecting equipment against 14.1 MeV neutrons, maintaining the vacuum at power conditions, tritium handling.I expect that when ITER succeeds that the scientists will step back and say “no more research funding for Tokamaks - please keep your money - it is obvious that we were mistaken when we said that we could make an economically feasible Tokamak power plant.” YesWe should be spending the money on other fusion concepts, on more basic research.
