As a very simple example, two entangled photons might have complementary polarization. If one is vertically polarized, the other is horizontally polarized.As they fly off into space, their polarization is indeterminate, neither horizontal nor vertical (or both horizontal and vertical simultaneously, to get more to it). They stay in this weird intermediate state until one of them interacts with something that requires definite polarization…then the superposition collapses and they both have definite polarization.Then the superposition is broken.You cannot—never ever—say “I am going to flip this photon from horizontal to vertical” and have the other one flip from vertical to horizontal. That isn’t how it works.What’s more, you cannot say “I’ll just hang onto this photon and I’ll keep checking to see if the superposition collapses, if it does I’ll know Franklin is trying to message me” becauseYou’ll look at your photon.

So yes, a combination that inspired what writers segmented into individual characters (since US media tends to prefer many single-dimension characters rather than fewer complex ones -- it makes for easier writing and acting).I was at a presentation the other day and a team much like the teams depicted on the first show were ""super excited"" to show how they are going to disrupt the market with their new product (of course, mobile, social etc.) and in typical silicon valley spin, rather than admitting they are competing in a space where they know they will be crushed, they chose to leave out a bunch of important features in order to create a ""a new market space with huge room for potential success"" -- which is a fancy way of saying ""pre-successful"" or more honestly -- ""we are just starting to do something new and are completely unsure about this since the space is already saturate.""

9,"It depends on what you call a supercomputer. In most cases it means a sizable collection of machines that have a high speed network fabric.

Those were highly specialized and very expensive to own and operate.

Those were highly specialized and very expensive to own and operate. In the mid 90s networking became faster and cheaper on PCs starting the shift to the clusters we have today.There is a list of the top 500 of these machines as defined by their ability to solve a single double precision floating point problem. Over the last decade other classes of problems have become important, designs have shifted to optimize differently, and a few other lists have appeared with only partial unions between them. This leaves the number in the low thousands for listed world class machines.There are machines just below the list level that rightfully still deserve the title, but most of them are still in the million dollar plus range. That makes me think that class of machine numbers roughly in the low tens of thousands.There is a set of trends that is keeping this number down. First, large servers are getting powerful and eliminating the need for supercomputer clusters of machines for whole classes of data problems. I recently bought a single 2U server that was more capable in every way than all the supercomputers I worked on up until 2006. I've included a picture of the model below from Penguin computing and you can see, while it's a great machine, it isn't a supercomputer.Second, many problems can be solved by virtual clusters formed on the fly in the cloud. For academics this has worked really well as each project can just budget for a few runs as a trivial cost rather than the school building a massive infrastructure. This also eliminates the problem of supercomputers sitting idle (way more common than you might think), or having to wait for months to schedule time.A lot of users are shifting the need between these two options and eliminating the need for supercomputers in any of the traditional senses. There is still a need for high speed interconnects and specialized hardware, but it doesn't drive a lot of build outs anymore. Now there are even cloud offerings that are built to meet almost all of these needs.So my guess is around 20,000, but dropping fast. I think there will always be some need or desire to have one here and there, but I wouldn't be surprised to see the top 500 lists shrink to top 100 over the coming decade.",5 followers,Matthew Lai,3K,3.9K,13.2M,https://www.quora.com/Is-Google-the-most-powerful-company-in-the-world

The black things on the right are fans. They are tiny, and they spin really really fast to cool the 2 Xeons CPUs with tiny heatsinks. The only reason those CPUs don’t overheat despite such tiny heatsinks is there is an incredible amount of airflow over them. That’s why the fans sound like jet engines.The SuperMicro motherboard uses a proprietary form factor, and only has a VGA output. PCI-E slots are available if you plug in an expansion card (so the video card would be mounted on an expansion card that’s plugged into the motherboard). That’s how they can fit something like a video card in a case that thin. The video card would be parallel to the motherboard, not perpendicular like they usually are on consumer motherboards.So I had to design and use a laser cutter to build my own case out of acrylic, after finding new (and bigger) heatsinks for the CPUs.This is what I ended up with:Why go through all this trouble? I got a dual Xeon (2x8 cores then, 2x10 cores now) workstation with 64GB of memory for A LOT cheaper than what they normally cost. Was it worth it?

There was nothing and there wasThis is called ""staring into the abyss"" and it is an exercise in futility.  Like imagining ""infinity"" or ""endlessness"", our brains are linear and we struggle with the concept.  We need beginnings and ends, and--of course--when a beginning or an end happen, we do the opposite, we ask what came before and what came after.  We struggle both with absolutes and abstracts, we float somewhere in between and typically try not to venture too far outside the normal operating realm of our every-day, tactile lives.Yet, here we are, asking about the impetus of infinity and we're left dumbfounded and nonplussed.  So, we come back to your question and as yet there is no clear answer.  There may not be a comfortable answer--EVER.We, linear creatures, may end up existing for the remainder of time (several quintillion years, at least, until entropy increases to the point where the energy in the universe is completely inaccessible), and even if we evolve our intelligence to trillions and trillions and trillions of times our current level, we may never learn the answer.There is this notion that in the next two centuries we will begin waking up the matter in our nearby universe.  First the solar system.  Then the nearby stars.  And like dominoes each system after that.  By ""waking up"", this refers to gaining the ability on a sub-molecular (nano) level to convert every particle into a technological construct.  If we can create self-replicatingIf each two nanites can produce one nanite every two hours by gobbling up any material in its range, then at what point can the geometrically-increasing numbers of nanites effectively and rapidly consume and convert an entire asteroid to a functioning super-computer (and one comprised of circuitry that--cubic centimeter for cubic centimeter--is millions of times more powerful than anything we can make today)?  Then a full planet?  Then consume all of the stellar ejections and convert those as well?   This is why, within two centuries, it may become possible to build a Dyson Sphere.  Here--for the past several decades--we thought it would mean mastering building on a massive scale (something projected as happening many millennia into the future), but the truth is far closer and far more obvious:Don't fool yourself, BILLIONS of dollars are being spent right now on developing nano-robotics.  We've already build machines the size of cells.  In two decades we'll have machines that can crawl inside the nucleus of a cell.  Shortly thereafter we will have the ability to create machines that create themselves.  By the time some people reading this die, we'll be transforming the world in ways that make pollution look like skipping down a dirt path.These are uncomfortable thoughts and people fight thinking about them tooth-and-nail.  But, by this ability, it is referred to as ""waking up"" the universe.  First our star system, then those that are nearby.  Once matter is converted to something functional, what level of computing power are we talking about?  And consider that we haven't reached the basement of what matter can compute now, when you consider how far up and how far down we have to go, the level of computing power stored in the Solar System is many, many, many orders of magnitude greater than every computer and human brain that has ever existed up to this point in time.And so I'm coming full circle.  You asked the question about ""who"" created the Universe.  And my answer is this:  that fundamental question, and the long-long-long term fear of succumbing to the Heat Death of the Universe may well be what drives us (or, whatever comes after us) to build bigger, stronger, more powerful machines to answer those questions.  The sad thing is, it's completely conceivable that those answer may never come.  We may be forever trapped in this linear universe, never seeing the beginning and never escaping the end.There is the hope that ""something"" awaits us within the ken of an exponentially powerful super-computer that can provide our answers to those two questions (""How did the Universe begin?"" &  ""Can we escape its inexorable death?"").  Just as likely, though, that machine--unimaginably more powerful than anything we can imagine--may be stuck in the same linear Universe and be baffled by the same annoying concepts that spark our imaginations:  Beginnings and Ends.I find it amusing that my pesky intelligence, when compared to the amazing computing power of the future, may have just as much ability as it to gain those answers as--in truth--there just may be none to those two dilemmas.  When compared to the infinity, even two massively disparate things (my brain, a super-computer brain spanning thousands of star systems) are essentially tiny, insignificant, cosmically worthless and possibly doomed to the same fate.But . . . there are possibilities.",107 followers,Christopher Johnson,2.3K,2.3K,1.6M,https://www.quora.com/Why-dont-we-have-millions-of-qubits-being-entangled-Will-this-be-possible-a-decade-from-now
