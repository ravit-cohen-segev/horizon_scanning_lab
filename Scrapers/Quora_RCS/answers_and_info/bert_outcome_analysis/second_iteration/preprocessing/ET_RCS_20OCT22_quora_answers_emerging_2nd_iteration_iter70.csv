Or buying a share in an existing business, helping grow the power of certain billionaires and their corporations.Sequestering carbon, creating oxygen, food, and building materials, that’s a real investment in the future.",2 followers,Faisal Khan,18K,5.6K,23.5M,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-good-investment-strategies-that-are-unconventional
1,"Investment strategies assist investors in identifying where and how to invest based on their projected return, risk tolerance, capital size, long-term versus short-term holdings, retirement age, industry preference, and other factors.

Investors can organize their investing plans according to their targets and aspirations.Here are some good investment strategies that you can follow as a new investor?The holding tenure was determined by the amount of value that investors wanted to add to their portfolios. Investors will invest in companies that they anticipate will grow in the next years, enhancing the underlying value of their shares. Growth investment is another term for this. Investors, on the other hand, can choose short-term holding if they anticipate a company will produce good value in a year or two. Investors' choices influence the holding period. For instance, how swiftly they want money to buy a house, send their children to school, plan for retirement, and so on.Since some companies are undervalued by the stock market, value investing involves investing in them based on their inherent value. The concept behind investing in such companies is that when the market goes through a correction, the value of such undervalued companies will be adjusted, and the price would surge, leaving investors with large returns when they sell.Note:-Warren Buffet, a well-known investor, implements this method.","135,195 followers",Hector Quintanilla,10.6K,1.2K,88.2M,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-good-investment-strategies-that-are-unconventional

If you can find assets that are highly correlated, you can trade the spread between them. Because you are long one and short the other, because they correlate, they should move in the same direction.

Focus on the long-term. A long-term plan shouldn’t be affected by stocks rising or falling, by 20%.3. Diversify both in terms of time diversification, as it is safer as per the charts below, and asset diversification - not putting all your eggs in one basket.The last point is especially the case for middle-aged and older investors.4. Take advice where needed. This could be to do with tax, investing, or other issues.The more complicated your situation, the greater chance that advice will add some benefits.5. Don’t try to time the perfect time to buy assets, also known as market timing, which doesn’t work.And finally, they don’t stay in cash. Cash is a 100% guaranteed inflation loss.What’s more, this year, inflation is due to top 10% in the UK according to the Bank of England’s forecasts, with banks paying 1%. That is a 9% loss to inflation.If you buy assets, they will go up and down, but even if they go down, you don’t face a loss (only a decline) unless you sell out.Nobody “lost” money investing one day before the stock and real estate crash in 2007-2008, if they kept their nerve.
