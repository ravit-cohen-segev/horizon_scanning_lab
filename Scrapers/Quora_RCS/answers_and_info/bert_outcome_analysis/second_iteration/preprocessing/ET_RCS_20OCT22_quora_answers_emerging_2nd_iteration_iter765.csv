You sit in one location, you look at a 2d screen (which may be trying to render objects in 3d on the screen, but your brain tells you “sitting in a chair, looking at a screen, all that stuff is 20 inches away no matter what the visual cues are saying”. Same with sound - might be stereoscopic but typically doesn’t create a full 3d soundstage particularly of stuff behind you.Spatial computing tries to bridge that gap, plain and simple.It wants to (depending on who you talk to) either create a very real “feeling” world around you (while you’re sitting in a chair) or be something you carry with you into the world moving around, which provides enhanced computer overlays of information.In cars, there are two great use cases.If you’re a passenger, you can use it to beat the dreaded “are we there yet” syndrome. You can combine the motion that the body already feels with a storyline and computed visuals (have to sync to actual motion, right?) to turn a three hour ride to see Grandma into a adventure on a creaky old train in an abandoned mine… or an ocean voyage… or riding a Thraxxian dwebniz across the plains of Zynity IV.If you’re a driver, you can use it to develop super informative heads up displays - taking all sorts of stuff into account. Knowing that you prefer to buy gas at DInojuice stattions, and this one on the right is the last for a hundred miles. Knowing that one of your passengers might like a quick pit stop at the Crapco because they’re giving away free stickers with each Megacola. Letting you know what’s up with your blind spots, but only when you need to know.

3,"It’s a fairly science-fictional concept, where interacting with a computer isn’t limited to physical bits of a computer such as keyboard, mouse and display. For example, in virtual reality, you could move some bits of a model around, and that would end up changing the model in the computer. Another (sf) example would be the computer interface in Minority Report. I have read about projected keyboards for mobiles, instead of an on-screen keyboard, the keyboard is projected onto a flat surface and you “type” on the surface.

I changed my last name after a group of wonderful men took care of me, with no strings attached, and flew me to my granddad.Edit:This happened in 1975. Apparently this upsets some conservatives. Here's the deal, I don't care. It baffles me that these conservatives were not upset at the idea of trafficking a kid, or selling that kid into marriage, that wasn't a problem for The Deleted Ones. The Deleted Ones wanted to apply 2020 to 1975. It doesn't work that way, kids. Flat out, this is not up for discussion. The question was why I cut him out of my life. I answered. It is not my problem if that upsets you. It might be an opportunity for you to reflect on why you are okay with child marriage though. I will delete and block people who try to get political with me about what happened to me.Edit on the edit…Apparently I have to disable comments. I have a troll reporting me on my thread to delete me comments on my experience. Nope. That will not get me to delete my very real experience, but it did get me to disable comments from people who are apparently pro child marriage.

My father blamed that on us and never stood up for us kids. He bought us a tablet for Christmas and used that to say how much he loves us and also how ungrateful we are. When my mother would call us kids to see how we were doing he would tell me my mother said she didnt want to talk to me. At 13 I found out all of his lies and that's where the trouble between us began. I fought back and didn't believe a word he told me, I resented him so much. He consistently made our arguments physical and I always had bruises from him. In highschool I would visit the counselor often as I didnt have any friends. My stepmother used this to make fun of me and told my dad if I wasnt on psych pills I wasnt allowed to live there. He tried to convince me an my aunt's that I was schizophrenic and bi-polar. My aunt was livid when I told her that day. And eventually I was kicked out. I wanted to be with my mom but my dad said no and forced me to live with his parents at 16. This was just as bad. 6 months later I finally moved with my mom. At 17 I'm with my mom and stopped talking to him as much as I could cause hes toxic but he would still contact me often. I'm 22 now and what broke the final straw was one day I was at my boyfriend's house when he starts messaging me which I new was trouble. He calls me with a wild accusation that I was having s*x in front of my daughter and taking inappropriate images of her and that I was beating her. He hasn't seen me for over 8 months,maybe a year, and didnt knowing had boyfriend until he asked. I called him sick and he threatened to call the cops on me. I told him go for it. He then proceeds to tell my entire family. Nobody believes him.Hes no longer a part of the family and him and his new wife's child can go elsewhere. After I found out he contacted family members with his story I filed a restraining order. Hes a horrible man and I'm glad I can finally remove him from my life and keep him far away from my daughter.","2,885 followers",Casper Bird,7.5K,659,10.5M,https://www.quora.com/In-layman-s-terms-what-is-spatial-computing-and-how-will-it-be-used-especially-in-cars

As time passed she soon realised he was an alcoholic & a nasty drunk as soon as he left the pub, he was the life of the party at the pub but a wanker when he got home. She loved him & tried to help him, he would always dish out excuses for why their relationship wasn’t working, for why he would fly off the handle & lose his temper. She listened to every excuse & made changes to their lives accordingly to see if his excuses were the reason even when she knew in her heart it wasn’t correct. This all happened before & after my birth. Once she had exhausted all options she kicked him out of our home & divorced him. He signed his right away to me in their divorce. I don’t blame my mum for having that in the paper work. I mean he’s already throw a plate at the wall, covering me into shards of sharp plate when I was a baby in my bouncer & he’d thrown a pavement slab through our window narrowly missing both my older sister & me (it would have killed us both had it of hit us) all in a drunken rage. Please don’t think of my mother as some timid victim of a woman because I can promise you she is not! She’s not the kind of woman, she strong & fearless, all four foot of her 😂Even though he signed his rights away for me my mother had an opened door policy with regards to him coming to see me & having a relationship with me. She wanted me to make my own opinion on him when I was old enough. At first he was allowed to take me out with him, until he drove me home in his van when he couldn’t even stand. She would ask him to not come visit me when drunk, he couldn’t manage that.My memories of him from my childhood are very fleeting, he would randomly turn up at my door often with random gifts & always drunk in varying degrees. Then I wouldn’t see him for months on end. To me it was normal as I didn’t know any different for he & I. As I grew older I was aware that other people’s dads weren’t like that, my older siblings went to their dads house every other weekend & so did my friends.by the time I was around seven I was pretty grown up for my age. I knew he was an alcoholic & unreliable but I also always wanted him to be the dad I used to dream of. So I would always give him chance after chance to let me down. He would always deliver on the disappointment scale & I grew hard to it.One day he come to get me so we could go to the local fun fair. He promised me he was sober now. Within seconds of us leaving my house, we rounded a corner out of site of my home, he bent down and picked up a plastic lucazade bottle from the bush and started to drink it. I was disgusted, one because it had come from the bush and then I saw the colour of the liquid inside. It was clear and not the orange hue it should have been. I knew it was vodka & that he had lied again. I remember so clearly having an internal debate with myself about going back home & telling him I don’t want to go with him or continuing to the fun fair. I decided to go to the fun fair with him, after telling him I knew he had vodka in his bottle. He told me on the walk to the fun fair that we would have so much fun, I could go on any rides I wanted bla bla bla, he just really hyped the whole thing up.we arrived at the fun fair & like a typical kid I was hyped. Running around etc I pointed to a ride & asked to go on it but was told no, I pointed to another & got another cold no, followed by another & another & another. By which point I was pissed. I told him I was going home (it wasn’t far from my home & I knew the way back!) I did call my mum but he wouldn’t let me talk to her, He grabbed the phone from me, when I tried to walk away he grabbed my wrist with a vice grip. I remember being in so much pain as I’d only just had my cast removed from fracturing the same wrist at school, perhaps he never knew about that now I think about it. He was talking to my mum whilst all this happened & I was shouting in the background that he needed to let me go & that I wanted to go home. He ended the call with my mum & I knew she was already in her car to come & get me. I managed to forcefully shove my knee right into his balls causing him to unhand me, I remember as I stormed off away from him feeling so triumphant & proud of myself. My mum arrived in the car with my older brother & his friend moment later to take me home, an argument broke up between my dad, my mum & my older brother which resulted in my dad running away before my brother could punch him 😂After that day I was pretty dead set on him not being apart of my life but again a part of me still longed for that father-daughter relationship that most girls have with their father, I was super lucky to have that kind of a relationship with my Pops (my mums dad)A few years past during which I got into contact with my Dads other child, my older brother & he & I started to build our own relationship, I instigated it when my other brother (my mums third child) took his own life. Our relationship ended in a shit storm too, he would often beg & guilt trip me into seeing my dad. They would both claim he was sober but after hearing it for years I always felt it was a lie, my dads son would always tell me how unwell he is and that he could die. My dad did end up in the hospital & my dads son begged me to go see him, so I did not for my dad but for my brother. Drunk or sober he was still an ass, after a few seconds of arriving he began to talk down on my mum, my older sister and then my two older brothers. It had only been roughly a year since my brother had taken his own life & it was still very much an open wound, I was fourteen at this point in time but thought I was an adult. I lost my temper with him! How dare he talk so badly about the people in my life who provided for me, cared for me & shaped me into the person I am. The people who held me when I cut my knee whilst playing, the people who hugged my after I’d had nightmares, my siblings who had forever been my best friends and greatest confidants! How dare he be so rude about the people who know me inside & out when he couldn’t even tell someone my favourite colour! I was in a blind rage, I can’t remember the fireworkd of words that left my mouth that day but I know it was heated, the poor nurse in his hospital room didn’t know where to look. I left the hospital that day and never saw him again. He officially died one year & one week after my brother, I am not completely sure how he died my understanding it that he was having an operation due to the abuse he’d done to his liver & died of complications during the operation.His family have never bothered with me my whole life, when they lived only ten minutes away from me, twenty if walking. The only time I saw his parents was when he took me to see them & his sister or brother was when he was in the hospital before dying. I have a whole half of a blood line (I can’t call them family because they aren’t!) that I don’t know, cousins I don’t know etc it’s really sad when you think about it. However when it came to my dads funeral they quite literally harassed me for weeks to try and bully me into attending. Part of me thinks perhaps I would have gone had it not have been for his mother suddenly finding the nerve to call my house phone and mobile on repeat every single day (something she hadn’t done for fourteen years of my life!) but the honest truth is I don’t think anything would have made me go for t...",99 followers,David Johnson,13.5K,142,1M,https://www.quora.com/What-made-you-cut-your-dad-out-of-your-life

My biological father is a narcissist and being a master manipulator, he was very good at making me, my siblings and our mom believe we were the awful ones. He also made it appear as though we had the perfect family to anyone outside the walls of our childhood…Just to give a bit of premise, I can clearly recall the moment that he stood over a 7-year old me after having beaten me and he told me that I am fat, ugly and no one would ever love me… those memories are a dime a dozen. That one just so happens to actually be a defining moment for me.When I became an adult, after years and years of abuse, now on the outside of it… he managed to manipulate me into believing he'd actually changed. He and my mom started fostering kids… then they ended up adopting my brother and another little girl. I thought it was a great thing… and I know without a doubt that my siblings are all a great thing… but they deserved far better by way of a father.Fast forward probably not even a year later, he ended up turning himself over to the police for unspeakable crimes against my adopted sister. I won't go into details here, as she was shortly after stripped from my mom, who managed to fight to keep my brother… my biological father was then sent to prison, where he served 5 years on a 15 year sentence.It didn't take much time for me to realize that I had been dooped like the rest of the world had been while I was growing up. I was angry that, I as an adult person, hadn't seen thru the mind play to see what was really happening. It took me much longer to come to terms with that part. But it didn't take me long to write him out of my storyline.I wrote him a letter before he was even sentenced to prison…I told him I no longer had a father. That he was no longer welcome in my life. And then I wrote letters to the parole board annually to ask for them to see thru his manipulation and keep him for as long as possible.Eventually, I got a dad that every child deserves. I was in my early 30’s and this fantastic man swooped in, took on years of abused children when he didn't have to… he helped repair the damage done to my mom as well. He would go on to become the best (and ONLY) grandfather my children would ever know.My children (twins) are now 7. I look at them and wonder how anyone can do and say such awful things to their child. I see my babies and think, how could anyone not tell them how amazing they are and what kind of wonderful future they can have…I'm forever grateful for the dad I had, no matter how short the time was that he was on this planet… I changed my name and took on my dad's name (step) and then I had to explain to my kids that I had a different father growing up then their fantastic Papaw. They know that the man exists, but that they will never have to meet him.And to head it off at the gate… my mom was one of his abused as well. She wasn't witness to the majority of the abuse going on, as she worked and went to school to try and keep us fed and clothed. She is the reason that any of us kids had any sort of happiness in childhood. But she was a victim of his Narcissistic abuse as well… she later would give us kids a daddy we deserved in a step dad who definitely stepped up.","27,547 followers",Kittie Rayborn,1.9K,1.7K,24.1M,https://www.quora.com/What-made-you-cut-your-dad-out-of-your-life

My mother decided to separate with him when she found another woman’s number on him and at one we went to live with my uncle. This separation lasted until I was around six. This is when dad decided to join the Navy and try to get his life together and asked my mom to give it a second chance. She took the bait and we moved halfway across the country from Indiana to coastal Virginia. For a bit it wasn’t too bad. Mainly because my dad was out to see most of the time for the first few years. Well as the last few years of his four year enlistment came to an end he announced that we were moving back to Indiana. My mother argued that she had a good job in Virginia that would support us until he found something, but he insisted on going back with no job lined up and not pan whatsoever. That was the last straw for my mom and she gave him the ultimatum of get a plan and a job lined up or she isn’t going. Well my dad went back to Indiana. I don’t even remember him saying goodbye (if he did). I was 10.After that the only time I would see him was a few days during the summer. It’s not like he didn’t have plenty of opportunity. Every summer my mom sent me to stay with my grandparents who lived in the same city as my dad. For the entire summer I was only a few miles from him and only would see him a few weekends. The rest of the year I got no calls, no letters, not even much as a Christmas present. Honestly it never really bothered me much. I was even there as his best man (I have no idea why) when he remarried. I still gave him more chances than I probably should have up to that point. He went on to have another child with her and then again promptly get a divorce again. To his credit he did stay close and helped take care of his kid for some years. By this time I had joined the military and had my first child with my wife. When my boy was born I told my wife that my goal was to be a better father than my dad was (not a hard task whatsoever). I decided then that although by this time I barely communicated with him I thought that he at least deserved to meet his grandson. So we went up to Indiana to visit. This was also the first time I met my half sister. She was already around 10 by this point and she was a great kid and we still talk today. We were only there for a day and spent the rest of our time at my grandparents. Well a few years after our visit I find out that my half sister’s mother is dying and only has a few months left to live. I assumed that my father would do the right thing and raise her full time. It’s not like he had anything better to do as he didn’t work due to health problems himself (pacemaker and on social security). Unfortunately I was wrong as just after the mother died instead of taking care of his daughter he decides out of nowhere to abandon her and go to Italy to reconnect with a woman that he had met there when he was there for a month in the Navy (when he was married to my mom). That was when I basically told him off and disowned him completely.Within 6 months “things didn’t work out” and he was coming back to the states. I was hopeful that he would finally take some responsibility but I was dead wrong as usual. He ended up moving in with his sister in Florida and barely communicating with his daughter who now lived with her grandmother on her mother’s side. Even when her Grandmother became unable to take care of her he didn’t help and she ended up with one of her aunts.Finally, and last I heard about him, he was completely catfished by someone who took basically all of his money over a few years time. My sister attempted to save him from this even getting him on the Dr. Phil show, but I don’t think it helped and really showed what kind of person he has become over the years. It really cemented the reason I want no contact with the man whatsoever. Besides a recent FB friends request I haven’t heard anything from him at all.",532 followers,Joanna Lee,732,0,0,https://www.quora.com/What-made-you-cut-your-dad-out-of-your-life

He should have done something, anything, to protect me, but he didn’t. He stayed far enough away to not be burdened with any responsibility. He’s also extremely religious, so violating one of the ten commandements is unthinkable to him. Or so I thought, until he tried to manipulate me into breaking more than one at one time.Why would he do this? His ego is fragile. It was seriously wounded when my mother got out from under his thumb. And after all those years, he must have still seen my mother’s second husband as his rival. So he tried to use the child he didn’t raise to kill his rival, and thereby get back at my mother in two ways-I’d have spent my life in prison, taking me away from her, too. Fortunately for me, I have a conscience, unlike my father, my stepfather, or my mother, who chose to let these horribly abusive men make a mockery of the family life she had always pretended she did so well.","29,333 followers",ER Mikulincer,12.9K,17K,64.2M,https://www.quora.com/What-made-you-cut-your-dad-out-of-your-life

I can only imagine that 50% or more of alien-abduction stories start the same way. In the 1970s and 1980s, people did not have camera phones, but evidently no shortage of alleged UFO storytellers not only owned a camera, but just happened to bring their camera along with them, at night (to take pictures of what, exactly?). Oh, how circumstantially-convenient…Science relies on a rigorous set of standards and scientific method to differentiate fact from fiction. From what is independently-verified from empirical evidence has the potential to be regarded as fact; whereas anecdotal “stories”, personal accounts, speculation, conjecture, or hearsay are not considered as having met any form of professional standards and likely have limited value in society, especially in science. They are nothing but a distraction. No professional discipline or school of thought has any time, nor should they have any patience, for this nonsense, when time, money and resources are much better used to help find a cure for cancer - not serve as a handmaiden to give an attention-seeker a public platform.The job of science is to not to run down every rabbit-hole and chase every conspiracy-theory that some storyteller decides to impose and make scientists run-ragged over. The burden of proof is on the storyteller, not the scientist, and the standards of “proving” anything are high.Frankly, the best way to deal with the latest unmitigated political attack on fact-based science by the so-called “Flat Earth Society” is to not give the group or their propaganda any attention, airtime or debate, because things like this were long-since settled centuries ago. Not everything needs to be placed in a revolving door and rehashed at the whim of others. “Fair and balanced” is not universally-applicable to everything. If a mathematician tells you that 2+2=4, a politician screams that 2+2=6, and then if a well-meaning middle-ground mediator wants everyone to compromise with 2+2=5 - it is STILL WRONG!!!“Truth” is the main point of contention. Something does not get universally-regarded as fact until it meets certain standards - and facts, not politics or agendas, are what is important and are the basis for the modern society that we live in. The basis for extraterrestrials might have many entertaining conspiracy-theories, but even if one or more events were indeed true - the credibility of any extraterrestrial encounter is suspect due to the vast number of people who have fabricated a contrived set of circumstances and even built props intended to fool those who welcome conspiracy theories. No one is being served by this foolishness; this is all a distraction from legitimate science that has a real and valuable place to serve humanity.","16,527 followers",Lee Thé,2K,10K,80.5M,https://www.quora.com/In-layman-s-terms-what-is-spatial-computing-and-how-will-it-be-used-especially-in-cars

So, why bother?Science does notThe primary point of contention is the lack of verifiable, reproducible evidence. Secondarily, extraterrestrial visits are something to prove and not something whose denial must be proven. Why? Because everything we know (so far) in science speaks against the idea. We have well-verified theories against FTL travel. OTOH, we know that, if you have enough power at your disposal, you can travel across the galaxy in a few days (actually a distance that equals that because traveling at such a high speed makes even colliding with molecules a problem) in your time frame. It will still take around 100,000 years in the galaxy’s time frame.We can infer from a great deal of evidence that technological societies on other planets are very rare indeed, so rare that finding one within 100 light-years of us would be like winning the PowerBall lottery.Likewise, another technological society (and there probably are/have been/will be some elsewhere in this gigantic universe) would have to find us and decide to visit for some reason that I cannot divine. Even fantastic technology must deal with background noise, and that limits the range to a few hundred light-years. Even if extraordinary technology were created, extra-galactic detection would be impossible and would only happen millions of years after our presence developed.It’s fairly certain now that no such society is in our immediate neighborhood (100 light-years radius). But, that’s only one-millionth of the galaxy. Suppose that one is out there 1,000 light-years away. Suppose that they could search the 100 billion or so stars in our galaxy and that they could detect the peculiar evidence of life on a planet orbiting our star (not likely, but suppose anyway). They’d be looking at our planet as it was 1,000 years ago. Absolutely no evidence of technology would show up on their scans.Oh! But, to visit now or in the past would require that they discovered us long ago, long enough ago to travel here, a trip that must take at least 1,000 years even if they could travel at near light speed. The people on their home planet would have to wait another 1,000 years to hear about their discoveries. The cost of such a voyage would be staggering, even for a very advanced civilization. Would our world undertake such a voyage? I doubt it. What value would such a trip have? It’s not as though you can take mineral resources back in under 1,000 years. Besides, those are readily available in any solar system without traveling to another.Please note that 1,000 light-years distant is not really far in a galaxy as large as ours. We’re only looking at 0.01% of our galaxy by looking that far.There’s only one scenario that would bring outworlders here: the destruction of their home system, probably by their sun exploding or expanding or dying. They’d have to build a starship large enough to carry the entire race to somewhere else. If they could do that, then they probably could find a closer system to move too. If they found us, and they traveled here, why would they be doing sneaky visits. Using their advanced technology, they could simply sterilize our planet and take it over. If, for some altruistic reason, they decided to leave us alone, they’d just take off to the next best system. You would have to presume some sort of cloaking system for their monstrous spaceship, or we would readily see it.That scenario is so far out in so many ways that it makes sense to ignore it. What are the chances of an advanced technological society losing their solar system somewhere “nearby” and then selecting our system to move to? I won’t expand this answer by considering all of the factors.
