A lot of the things that looked like ‘advancements’ were in reality nothing more than modifying pieces of hardware (or procedures, or both) to drop some of the innate ‘conservatism’ that had been designed into them since the program began.Simple Example #1—the External Tank (ET) was originally designed and fabricated from a lot of 2219 aluminum. 2219 was picked (among other reasons) because welding techniques for it had been mastered, and its stress corrosion characteristics were well understood, and compatible with the ET spending a protracted amount of time at a seaside launch pad (and a lot of them did!). It was also designed with a considerable reserve of load-carrying capacity, which resulted in it being several thousand pounds heavier than it really needed to be. Around the time of STS-7 or STS-8 (this is from memory, so the flight number may be off a little bit) a ‘new’ version of the ET was introduced, called the Lightweight External Tank (LWT). Some of the possible weight reduction (though not all of it) was built into the LWT design, which resulted in us being able to fly heavier payloads. But the rest of the weight reduction had to wait until the ‘Super Light Weight Tank’ (SLWT) was introduced. This happened much closer to the end of the program. The SLWT was fabricated from a ‘new’ aluminum alloy, containing Lithium (I think the alloy was 2195). It’s density was lower than that of 2219, so the resulting ET would weigh considerably less. New welding techniques had to be developed for it. NASA had been ‘drooling’ over the idea of the 2195-type aluminum in a space vehicle since the late 1960’s (which shows you how ‘new’ it is!) but had not had an opportunity to implement it. The SWLT also required a fundamental re-examination of portions of the Shuttle’s Guidance, Navigation, and Control system. It turns out that to get the weight reduction that was sought, the SLWT lost stiffness, and became more ‘flexible’—especially with a 170,000 pound Orbiter hanging off of the side of it. This required upgrading the vehicle’s Flight Control system in order to assure that the ‘less stiff’ structure would still fly in a stable manner. That entire upgrade was in software for the Orbiter’s Data Processing System, so it is not ‘visible’ to someone just looking at the vehicle (either inside or out!).Simple Example #2—The Orbiter’s Data Processing system was equipped with 5 flight computers. They were from IBM’s Federal Systems Division, from a family of avionics referred to as ‘IBM System 4 Pi’. The original version of these computers used ferrite core memory (that’s not a misprint!). By 1990 or so IBM was trying hard to convince NASA to switch the computers to semiconductor memory—in part because the production cost of the ferrite core memory was very high. NASA finally acquiesced—after a long battle. While you might call this a ‘technological advance’, the idea of switching from something 40 years old to something 20 years old doesn’t excite me quite that much. (I don’t want to seem like I’m making light of it—(totally, at least…)—there were legitimate reasons for using ferrite core memory in these computers, having to do with the risk of having ‘bits’ in memory being ‘upset’ by energetic charged particles from space. The semiconductor memory wound up having to be shielded, and a multi-bit error detection and correction scheme implemented. That part wasn’t easy).Popular Misconception—I also should state that some changes made to the vehicles had been reported (by various sources) as being ‘advances’ when they actually were quite the opposite. One of these was made in the Space Shuttle Main Engines (SSMEs). There were 2 or 3 system ‘upgrades’ that had been reported as ‘the new SSMEs have an Advanced This, or Advanced That, often referring to a new generation of high pressure turbomachinery. In fact, the SSMEs equipped with the Advanced This or the Advanced That produced the same thrust and (almost) the same Isp performance as the original engines, but weighed something like 1000 pounds more per engine. My only point here is that producing the same engine ballistic performance in a package that is something like 10% - 15% heaver than the original is not normally considered a ‘technological advance’.I hope you find the above helpful.",5 followers,Heikki Kultala,611,1.5K,7.4M,https://www.quora.com/How-much-more-technologically-advanced-was-the-last-space-shuttle-compared-to-the-first-space-shuttle

It has much smaller wings which are only used for aerobraking and control purposes, and lands vertically instead, using its engines. All the weight of the big wings of the STS orbiter is away from the payload it can carry, and all the area the big wings have need to have heat shielding.So, Starship has about 4x more payload capacity than STS, even though it only has about 2.5x higher liftoff weight and better reusability.STS throws away the fuel tank, and new fuel tanks has to be built for every flight, Starship has the fuel tank inside the body.STS boosters drop in the ocean, and need to be first fetched from the ocean with ship, and they are totally reconstructed before reusing them. This is both expensive and time-consuming. Practically, they are recycled, not reused. The “SuperHeavy” booster of Starship can land on it’s own engines back to the launch siten and reused quicky with very little maintenance between the flights.Because STS orbiter has very complex aerodynamic shape, most of it’s heat shield tiles are uniquely shaped. This makes their maintenance very expensive. Starship shape is a simple cylinder with a nosecone, and flat, simple-shaped wings. Most of the heats shield tiles of Starship can be of exactly same shape, making their maintenance easy and cheap. This makes maintenance of Starship between flights much cheaper.In STS, the boosters, fuel tank, and orbiter are all parallel, very close to each others. This means that for example insulation foam can fall from the fuel tank and hit the orbiter and damage the heat shields (Columbia accident) or a problem in the booster can damage the fuel tank of the shuttle (Challenger accident).In Starship, there are only two parts, and those are stacked vertically, nothing from the boosters can hit the Starship part. This means both better safety and less maintenance required for the heat shield tiles","35,117 followers",C Stuart Hardwick,616,12.3K,142.5M,https://www.quora.com/How-much-more-technologically-advanced-was-the-last-space-shuttle-compared-to-the-first-space-shuttle

Call it a cult, a very nice, warm and fuzzy cult.One VC has publicly stated that if Elon ever needed money for anything, all he had to do was name a number and a check would be waiting, no questions asked.Furthermore, 95% (number pulled from ass, but with high confidence) of them believe, beyond any doubt, that Global Warming (GW) is very real and Tesla and Elon are seen as the “tip of the spear” in the fight against GW.Given Tesla is an automobile manufacturer, it has come an amazingly long way in a short period of time, largely due to Elon and his team. The Valley is proud of both, very proud.I seriously doubt they will allow Tesla to fail, just due to cash flow, because Tesla is their baby too.Additionally, Elon also owns 66% of a cash machine called SpaceX. SpaceX has a very real need to park its money in bonds. In the past, SpaceX bought Solar City bonds. I believe when Tesla acquired Solar City, the bonds were paid off. (I am not 100% on that, so you might want to check.) Consequently, given Elon has full control of SpaceX, Tesla can always sell them some bonds.Then, there is a hardy core of cultish stockholders, like me, who keep buying every new issue of stock, because we have the long view and work hard at understanding the company.Granted, the cash burn is more of a bonfire. But, the money is not being pissed away, good money after bad, but quite the opposite. It is being invested in the new manufacturing process ( machine that makes the machine), other infrastructure, strategic acquisitions and the very best people.Making cars is hard. Elon has affirmed that its a tougher nut than rocket science. In addition, Tesla is doing it different than any prior, breaking new ground daily, in some big and innumerably small ways. Innovation rarely proceeds in a straight line and can be plagued by fits and starts. With complex assembly lines, bottlenecks can be vexing and as soon as you clear one, others pop up. But eventually, they will all be properly adjusted and the thing will hum.In addition, of those that own the car, 97% still say they will have no other and remain loyal, those in line for the Model Three still seem unfazed by the additional wait and engineers from around the world still long to work there. Moreover, they still don't advertise much at all, if any.One more thing, realize that it is the most shorted stock and those that are doing so love to spread bad news, no matter how trivial. Then there are people who just want to see Elon and Tesla fail. So there is no shortage of doom and gloom from that quarter. Thus consider the source when you hear something.

21,"The combustion in gas turbine engines occur at a constant pressure. In reality the pressure falls a little, but this is negligible. The combustion chamber of gas turbines are not fully closed like cylinders of piston engines. This allows pressure to remain constant.The highest pressure peak in the engine is found in an area just before the chamber. Here there is a divergent duct which reduces the flow velocity and increases the pressure of the air. This allows the air to slow down before entering the combustion chamber which prevents a flame out because the flame rate of kerosene is quite low.Continue ReadingThe combustion in gas turbine engines occur at a constant pressure.
