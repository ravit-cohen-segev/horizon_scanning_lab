That kept going on for a month.""This discovery is mind-blowing because the average laptop battery lasts 300 to 500 charge cycles. The nanobattery developed at UCI made it though 200,000 cycles in three months. That would extend the life of the average laptop battery by about 400 years. The rest of the device would have probably gone kaput decades before the battery, but the implications for a battery that that lasts hundreds of years are pretty startling.""The big picture is that there may be a very simple way to stabilize nanowires of the type that we studied,"" Penner said.

The most comprehensive and effective article by Peter Altmaier (see below) covers so much ground that it is almost impossible to summarise, and I have struggled to do that, as shown below. But also see Sigurt Vitol’s thoughtful and considered paper about GERMAN INDUSTRIAL POLICY: AN OVERVIEW which can be downloaded at2.1.1 The Objective of the Policy: The Creation, Across All of The German Economy, Advanced Computerised “Smart Factories” with a major upgrading in the optimised computerised interconnection of factory operations from raw materials, subcomponent and energy inputs to specific, individual-customer-specified outputs.As Peter Altmaier, the German Federal Minister for Economic Affairs and Energy Germany has summarised it, in“Germany has a strong and successful industrial base. We need to keep it that way, we need to expand that.”In his lengthy and utterly specific article, he describes a policy which is the “fourth industrial revolution” which he names and describes:“INDUSTRIE 4.0Digitally driven and smartly networked“Digitally controlled production processes, smart factories and a networking of sales, production and logistics: the term ""Industrie 4.0"" describes a fourth industrial revolution which is picking up speed in the wake of rapid digitalisation.” And the description of the technology is“Industrie 4.0 combines production methods with state-of-the-art information and communication technology. This smart approach makes it possible to deliver tailored products to meet individual customer requirements – at low cost and in high quality. Highly flexible production methods and logistics will make it possible to customise products. Customers and business partners will be directly involved in operational and production processes, and there will be production methods and products that are closely intertwined with state-of-the-art, knowledge-intensive services (hybrid production, hybrid products).”So the system involves the implied digitally-controlled minimal inputs of energy, water and raw materials, combined with the just-in-time delivery of highest quality SME subcomponents to be assembled into a low cost, high quality customer-specified customised product which can “talk” through the internet of things to its maker, its buyer and the network of things around it.(Presumably the first three industrial revolutions the Federal Minister may have in mind may be the previous IR stages of the ages of steam, of electricity production and consumption, and of computers/internet communications, and of all the associated developments in these eras.)2.1.2 The Major Industrial Sectors AffectedIndustrie4.0/Germany4.0““The process of technological transformation and the trend towards sharing knowledge and information on an ever-growing scale are continuing at unabated speed. Similarly, new developments in information and communication technology are having a considerable impact on the production of complex goods and services requiring a great deal of research and expertise.SoThe paper goes on to demonstrate that export performance, the growing importance of export-related services, and highlights more industries which have “Innovative technologies with potential for the future” which are listed as“Within the framework of the Federal Government’sIn addition to all of the above, Germany intends to2.2 TheAs2.2.1 The Origin of the PolicyChinese Premier3 The Comparisons Between Germany and ChinaBoth Germany and China have a highly educated and skilled workforce with millions of SMEs, many of which are acting at the forefront of their technology.Both countries fund the Wernerian transfer of invention to innovation in millions of their SMEs through effective local banking systems which help finance that process.4 The Differences Between the4.1 German Support for SME invention and InnovationAlthough Germany has a highly effective Sparkassen local public banking system to fund the establishment, development and updating of SMEs in each locality, Germany has a partly rationalised Sparkassen Banking System which, although the most effective in the world for a nation of Germany’s size, has the following sub-optimal characteristicsOne of the few jokes told by the“No - East Germany proves that the Germans can make anything work.” The relatively high growth rates of Communist East Germany (from 1945 to the 1960s) were due to the continuation of Germany’s Sparkassen Banks with their century and half traditions, of supporting SMEs even under Communist rule.Let me be as precise as the numbers can indicate: Herbert Simon has provided in his essay and book about the Hidden Champions of Germany the following dataWhich data I have summarised in the following generated table:More recent figures indicate that Germany has raised its delivery of “Hidden Champions” to above 1,600 with the result that the German level of champions per million people is about 20. It seems to me that a sub-analysis of the data is likely to show that some West German states are achieving hidden champion rates of about 25 champions per million people.Germany does not have an adequate system for the growth of “Hidden Champions” to world-serving scale, because it does not understand or use Shimomuran macroeconomics. Germany succeeds through the excellence of SME family firms and the few but large bank-supported major industries without having a “capital abundance” in all of its its manufacturing industry. Germany’s growth rate has always been intermediate because of that reality. The focus of German industry and politicians is upon Germany, and theThe EU is unfortunately being run by Germany as if it were a German Empire. Such an outcome was never intended by its founders who established and intended a co-operating commonwealth of collaborating nations. German politicians should grow into European citizens and while a “Germany first” bias inIn my view the level of invention and innovation is a constant capability of all peoples. When Scotland was the beneficiary of the slave-trading profits of the Tobacco Lords these funds (along with some Sugar Lord monies also based upon black slavery) founded the local Glasgow-centred banks of Scotland and invested in the 88 companies that were the foundation of the local industrial revolution. When England had at most 900 Provincial Banks these institutions funded the conversion of invention to innovation in England and that created the English part of the industrial revolution from about 1750 to 1880. All of that is well documented in sources too numerous and too voluminous to quote here.5 The Industrial Coverage ofThe Chinese data in the above table is incomplete because many Chinese SMEs are larger than the Hermann Simon definition as “having a revenue below $4bn”I have calculated the number of SMEs China should have, if the German number of SMEs per million people, is applied to China. About a third of Chinese SMEs seem to be missing, particularly in the western and central provinces of China where local bank SME support seems less supportive than the excellent local bank facilities in the Eastern coastal provinces and around Beijing.I have emailed (with no response so far) various Chinese economists and authorities pointing out that China could be growing more rapidly (I estimate by up to an extra 5%pa for decades) if these SME-supporting bank facilities were extended in western and central China.6 The Centrality of 5G Communications to the AI/IoT economy[Note: In some of the following quoted texts about 5G development, theThe upgrading in mobile phone and internet connections from the 4G system to 5G is a key component of the success of the new“China’s road to 5G has been well planned. In 2012, two years before China Mobile launched 4G services on the mainland, various Chinese entities joined an international initiative to research and develop 5G.“With peak data rates up to 20 times faster than 4G, 5G will serve as “the connective tissue” for new mobile applications, such as the internet of things, autonomous cars and smart cities – providing the backbone for the industrial internet, according to a Deloitte report.“On the consumer side, 5G smartphone users will be able to send high-resolution 4K video within a few seconds, and both video games and apps based on augmented and virtual reality technologies will be seamless. The 5G networks will also be able to support the growing number of connected devices globally, from fitness-tracking watches to internet-linked televisions and smart speakers at home.“The International Telecommunications Union, the United Nations agency overseeing development of the “IMT 2020” global standard for 5G, saidLet’s list these again, for these upgraded characteristics are astonishingAs the above report continues:“The agency works in tandem with the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), an international collaboration of seven telecoms standard development organisations that draw up complete mobile system specifications.The 3GPP recently approved the much-anticipated global technology specifications for 5G, which is expected to kick off initial deployments by some of the world’s largest telecoms network operators either later this year or early in 2019.There are two sets of specifications completed under the 3GPP: one is called “5G stand-alone”, which was approved in June, while the other one passed in December 2017 is known as “5G non-stand-alone”.”China has been steeped in the proposed 5G trials, testing and upgrading of mobile phone and IoT Communications from 4G to 5G, as this chart illustrates:And where is the USA in all this? US phone producer companies are involved but Trump seems to imagine that the USA has the power to call a halt on the essential development of this massive upgrading to 5G mobile/IoT services in which America has not been centrally involved.As“Gear based on the 5G stand-alone specifications is designed to run independently of 4G networks – and this is the standard China is pushing. Operators will need to rebuild their core network and buy new 5G base stations to provide higher data speeds and greater capacity,“The Chinese government wants every industry to use the most advanced infrastructure to upgrade productivity. This is a strategic agenda, and they think that 5G will help,” said Jefferies equity analyst Edison Lee, who covers Hong Kong-listed ZTE, China Mobile, China Unicom and China Telecom. He goes on to say“China has very ambitious plans to promote the industrial internet of things, cloud computing and artificial intelligence (AI), the capabilities of which require the support of brand-new 5G networks.”“For example, self-driving cars require sensors, AI and roadside base stations for fast and reliable connectivity to allow vehicles to “talk” to each other to avoid collisions and avoid pedestrians. Today’s 4G networks cannot meet those quick response times.“China’s plan for an aggressive 5G roll-out is in line with the MIC2025 road map. Initially, this focused on the domestic telecoms sector’s ability to increase broadband penetration nationwide to 82 per cent by 2025 as part of a push for industrial modernisation. Another objective was to see local suppliers making 40 per cent of all mobile phone chips used in the domestic market.“Under an updated version published in January, Beijing now wants China to become the world’s leading maker of telecoms equipment. Two of the world’s biggest telecoms gear suppliers, Shenzhen-based Huawei and ZTE, have helped lead China’s 5G research and development efforts.”7 Discussion7.1 The Implications Of Both Industrial ProgrammesBoth Germany and China are going to have the most advanced industrial manufacturing economies and best consumer life experiences in the world.7.2 The Trump Effect In Accelerating China’s DevelopmentWhen Trump banned the export of Intel microchips to China, the Chinese developed their own microchips within 14 months. Donald Trump’s forced march has brought the title of the “World’s fastest computer” back to the USA by June 12 2018 but China has 82 more supercomputers than the USA does. SeeAnd also see“According to7.3 The USA Is the Likely Loser, Whatever OccursPresident Trump appears to be trying to persuade the entire Anglosphere - the USA, Canada, The UK, Australia and the EU- to remain as a group of backward economies, staying with the slower 4G based communications while China and Asia adopt the much higher 5G standard. Of course Trump the Luddite does not know what he is doing nor understand the implications of what he does. The development of smart factories and cities requires smart politicians and Trump is not that.I do not wish to compare the likely results of an integrated 5G-based military technology operating at up to 20 times the speed of a 4G-based technology. But even the most approximate initial comparison indicates that the USA, as has happened since the manufacturing-industry-exporting Ronald Reagan, has failed to invest or participate not only in the development of 5G but also has failed to keep its key once-major industries within its borders and continually updated, and these events inevitably have significant military implications.The American Republican/Conservative preference for “Rule by, for and of the rich” produces a profound disdain for manufacturing, a neglect of the living standards of workers through Austerity, a rot of US roads and public services through “small government”, and a pathological culture in domestic and foreign relations. FDR was much better than that. Trump isn’t.8 Conclusions8.1 The Recent New Initiatives of8.2 The development of smart factories, smart cities and smart economies within a smarter environment is the inevitable next stage in the economic history of the world. It is unstoppable and inevitable and very helpful to the futures of Germany and China and perhaps in future in Europe and very probably in Asia.8.3 The USA needs to “get on board” and adopt these fresh industrial renewal processes and these policies and not to try to prevent progress in Germany and China. Or the USA could just politically accept the continuation of its trajectory of relative economic decline, which under current leadership seems inevitable. Alternatively, as a first step, the USA needs to study how rapid economic growth is financed in today’s world and adopt more people-serving policies. In my view there are hundreds, possibly thousands, of very capable American politicians, perhaps a majority of them women, who could reverse US economic decline.

It is a direct violation of your human dignity and your right to your earnings from trade and working.This is what the US Government thinks of you, this is the level of respect they have for you.If China abandons her long term plans to develop the nation, industry, infrastructure, public education, the people, national security and future then it will forfeit any and all rights to self determination and human dignity as well to a Mass Murdering Thief called the US Government.Surely the Chinese people have more human dignity and human potential than to surrender to the subhuman whims of the US Government?Additional Content & Updates:https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/the-latest-china-says-us-side-to-raise-zte-case-with-trump/2018/05/04/97225652-4f78-11e8-85c1-9326c4511033_story.html?noredirect=on&utm_term=.bba79370f84b6:25 p.m.The Trump administration wants China to reduce the trade deficit with the U.S. by $200 billion by the end of 2020.A U.S. official confirmed the authenticity of a document making that and other requests presented to China ahead of trade talks that ended Friday.The four-page list also included demands that China immediately stop providing subsidies to industries listed in a key industrial plan. The list also includes a demand that China end some of its policies related to technology transfers, a key source of tension underlying the dispute.So now the US Government is officially demanding $200 billion per year from China, up from $100 billion. And of course, the US Government still wants China to reduce domestic investment and development.The article above edited this part out that I saved:The U.S. wants China not to retaliate against U.S. measures currently being pursued against it.Wow this really paints the US Government in a truly evil light, they can attack and hurt you but you cannot defend yourself by retaliating. That’s some exceptional privilege! They already give us taxpaying American locals here enough grief so maybe they want to shareEditors didn’t edit this line out from these links yet yethttps://www.washingtonpost.com/business/technology/mnuchin-us-having-good-conversations-in-china-trade-talks/2018/05/03/980a2c52-4f4b-11e8-85c1-9326c4511033_story.html?utm_term=.7cb1c9a23c43Analysts: US trade demands could make deal with China harderThe U.S. wants China not to retaliate against U.S. measures currently being pursued against it. For instance, the U.S. says China should agree not to target U.S. farmers or agricultural products and “not oppose, challenge or otherwise retaliate” when the U.S. moves to restrict Chinese investment in the U.S. in sensitive sectors.American analysts were struck by the aggressiveness of the Trump team’s demands. Eswar Prasad, a professor of trade policy at Cornell University, said the hard-nosed approach “makes it harder to envision a path toward a negotiated settlement.”Keep an eye on article changes when you hit F5 Refresh folks :pThere’s a lot of human garbage in the US Government and, of course, the US News Entertainment industry.Additional Commentary: This is especially frustrating because China is an excellent partner for win win projects in the US.Example: A large apartment family friendly integrated complex housing at least 220 Residential Tenants and at least 12 Commercial Tenants in a heart of a city with room for expansion with a combination team of Architects and specialist Engineers from China and local Americans working together with custom made parts & materials from Chinese suppliers with the bulk of the denser heavier concrete/rebar/lumber from US suppliers that is put together by majority American labor. Project Managers include both Chinese and local Americans with the end product being a convenient community where you can live, play, hang out at Cafes, shop for fresh seafood and bakery, park your cars, charge the EVs and keep a full staff of American workers employed everyday to maintain the building and handle administrative duties.That’s win win and is made possible by Chinese owner investors who are willing to commit for the long term and don’t feel like they are being made out as the enemy.

It is not an exaggeration Bechtel can build entire cities, industrial complexes, and power grids from scratch.Fifty years ago, that was rather special, because Bechtel already had a CV that included the Hoover dam, and BART. In more recent years, Bechtel’s major projects include Boston’s Big Dig, and the Channel tunnel linking the UK with France.Pretty impressive, by any standard. If you have a difficult civil engineering project, Bechtel is the go-to contractor if you need been-there, done-that expertise. It has been the top U.S. contractor for 21 consecutive years, according to the ENR.How much revenue did the top U.S. contractor generate last year?About $25.5 billion.Now let’s cross the Pacific to China, a flight from first world to third to look at the Chinese competition.What’s China’s Bechtel?I would wager a bet very few have heard of this company:CSCEC, or the China State Construction Engineering Corporation.What was their revenue in 2019?1.2 trillion RMB, or $171 billion—almost 7 (yes, 7!) Bechtels worth of business.With a list of completed projects that include:The world’s first operational 3rd gen EPR nuclear power plant in Taishan.Tesla’s Shanghai Gigafactory 3.The Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center.The Guangzhou Opera House.The Xi’an Daming palace.The Shanghai World Financial Center.The $1.4 billion Wuhan railway station.The iconic CMG HQ in Beijing.The Macau Tower.The futuristic Baoan airport.The Haixia Olympic Center.The Chongqing International Convention and Exhibition Center.That is what one third world EPC is capable of, in terms of sheer scale and complexity.What’s my point?Fifty years ago, Bechtel was special, and operated in the rarefied air of exclusivity.Two decades into the new century, third world “upstarts” operate on way greater scale and have just-as-impressive references.The difference this time? They are significantly cheaper and faster while staying on-spec.Which is the same story you will find across the industrial spectrum. There may be few Chinese brands you’re aware of, but I bet there are numerous Chinese-made products in the average household, especially critical components of electronics found in everything from throwaway flashlights to the latest iphone.China has consistently delivered on-spec products at unbeatable prices and speed for decades. That is why she is the world’s factory—entirely on merit.I once asked an industry veteran why businesses are unable to resist the allure of China. He explained it wasn’t a matter of choice. If his competitor moves his factories to China, he has to follow suit or risk irrelevance within a decade. In other words, business models are turbocharged with Chinese production. Unless you have a niche market with moats and high walls, you die, even if you are brontosaurus size.All that talk about IP theft and forced tech transfers is way off base. The companies that went to China made decisions with their eyes wide open. They caught the prevailing wind which blew them into China’s embrace. In fact, many couldn’t wait to get in bed with the Chinese after catching wind of their competitors’ bottomline post-China.Notice the elevated proportion of those 25–34? That translates into tens of millions jobs that won’t be filled by those coming after them (the 10–24).Notice the elevated proportion of those 25–34? That translates into tens of millions jobs that won’t be filled by those coming after them (the 10–24).China is facing a labor crunch in the coming decade. Thankfully, it is not a nightmare because China is now at $10,000 GDP per capita, firmly third world. Which means there are plenty of third world jobs in the economy. Like assembling iphones. Or making plastic flowers. What the demographics tell us is older factories making low-margin goods will find it difficult to replace labor in the tight market, and fade into obsolescence. Wages will rise, fueled by better qualified ...","23,885 followers",Robin Daverman,1.2K,2.3K,40.1M,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-top-ten-inventions-of-the-last-decade

Well if you think that the Chinese government can run China secretly, you’ve been had!

See, they are trying to hide things from our Free Press!” And despite being profoundly illogical and impractical, some people (overwhelming among the English-speakers, and not among the German, French, and Italian-speakers), to this day, still believe this urban legend. I find this shocking.Let me ask you this question: have you heard of theCountries in Asia basically use it to make their own government budget, and Chambers of Commerce, from Sweden to Australia, will all pick up the useful bits and immediately send pamphlets to their business communities: “China is going to do this. Opportunity for us to make money!” That’s how “secret” it is.Now let’s take a look at the 12th five-year-plan (2011 - 2015) as an example. The plan set the following targets:Great. How do you think this can be done in secret? Hundreds of millions of people have this as their “to-do list” for this five years!The same with the “Made in China 2025”. It IS PART OF THE 13TH FIVE-YEAR-PLAN. Hundreds of millions of people have this on their own “to-do list” from now till 2025. Tens of thousands of organizations are involved. Every level of the Chinese government has this on their performance review form. The official Chinese government newspaper, People’s Daily, which is public with 3 million subscribers, praise those who get their jobs done, and criticize those who fail badly, on a daily basis. It’s called “using public shaming to drive behavior”. So how exactly can you keep all this secret, while still get 1.4 billion Chinese citizens to work together towards the common goals?It’s not possible. And this is why the Chinese government has never, ever, kept its public policies “secret”. Not since Day One of the founding of PRC. It’s not about “is it more beneficial to keep the plan secret”. It’s that to reach a common goal, hundreds of millions of people have to work together towards it by necessity. If you keep it secret, who’s going to get it done? You?
