I was nowhere close to even a regional-Olympiads, let alone International!I started solving problems during my physics club. It took me dozens of problems before I could up my level. I remember one day how I happily approached my teacher and told her: “Fast forward, two years and I was solving international Olympiad problems in ease!How? What did I do? What’s the secret?The secret is…JUST KEEP GOING.Honestly, just keep solving problems and I guarantee that you would get better in this.But DON’T just look up the solutions, and think that you solved the problem without understanding it and move on.You need to think about the problems but most importantly you have to getInstead, ask yourself, “why couldn’t I solve it? How could I have solved this?”Maybe it’s lack ofMaybe you had to thinkOn and on, you do this, and your problem solving would increase. And not only it would be good in physics, but in math, in computer science, and in life.The key point, however, is this:EVERYONE STARTS FROM THE BOTTOM.Nobody is born solving complex problems. Like any skill, problem-solving is developed.Just keep doing it and you WILL get there.

1,"The four-color theorem is the most famous mathematical problem to have been solved with the assistance of computers.

A more recent proof(some of the unavoidable, reducible configurations in the cited paper by Robertson et al.)The second-most-famous problem of this type is likely the Kepler Conjecture. In 1611, Johannes Kepler wrote a paper titled “On the six-cornered snowflake”, in which he conjectured that the densest packing of spheres in a given volume is achieved using the standard cubic or hexagonal close packings (which share the same density).This problem was open for 350 years. In 1998, Thomas Hales announced a proof which relied on significant computer calculations. Refereeing his paper was a monumental task which never really concluded; it was eventually published under a disclaimer that the referees are “99% certain” that the proof is correct.Motivated by a desire to settle the matter with full certainty, Hales initiated the Flyspeck project(Prof. Thomas Hales and a hexagonal lattice.

The black things on the right are fans. They are tiny, and they spin really really fast to cool the 2 Xeons CPUs with tiny heatsinks. The only reason those CPUs don’t overheat despite such tiny heatsinks is there is an incredible amount of airflow over them. That’s why the fans sound like jet engines.The SuperMicro motherboard uses a proprietary form factor, and only has a VGA output. PCI-E slots are available if you plug in an expansion card (so the video card would be mounted on an expansion card that’s plugged into the motherboard). That’s how they can fit something like a video card in a case that thin. The video card would be parallel to the motherboard, not perpendicular like they usually are on consumer motherboards.So I had to design and use a laser cutter to build my own case out of acrylic, after finding new (and bigger) heatsinks for the CPUs.This is what I ended up with:Why go through all this trouble? I got a dual Xeon (2x8 cores then, 2x10 cores now) workstation with 64GB of memory for A LOT cheaper than what they normally cost. Was it worth it? That depends on how much I value my time spent getting it to work… but that’s part of the fun.I am typing this answer on that computer (though it has been upgraded to water cooling).More details.",5 followers,Matthew Lai,3K,3.9K,13.2M,https://www.quora.com/unanswered/If-I-have-money-and-space-then-can-I-buy-super-computers

And you want to do this early as well, because interviewing and hiring experts is going to take a while - and you want those experts hired and on board for the next part….Now, you start thinking about logistics. Where will you put it, how do you get enough electric power for it, and what do you do for cooling? Knowing what you plan to do with it, you can make a first estimate of hardware, power, and cooling requirements. (This is one of the things you hired expert help for) You start this work first, because any construction has to finish before the system can arrive. We got lucky on the ones that I worked with, because we already had a quarter acre of raised floor server room. We *did* have to get the electric company to upgrade the local substation to handle several megawatts more, and run a new service feed about a mile from substation to our building. There was also additional construction work for cooling, and a bunch of other details like that.The next thing you do is you contact all the usual suspects: IBM, Cray, HPE, and a few others. You explain to them what you want to do with it, and they’ll help you pick out the number of cores you need, whether GPUs are a good idea, the interconnect between all the servers (and this actually matters more than the processors for some problems), a design for the system storage (you’re probably going to be buying petabytes of storage, and a bunch of servers just to manage it). You’ll probably need some high-end networking gear as well - and 100gigabit capable routers aren’t cheap.And here you end up doing a *lot* of trade-offs.. outfitting *all* the nodes with 3 terabytes of RAM gets expensive, so maybe you have 10 nodes that have 3 teras, and the others have only 512G of RAM. You have to figure out how many GPU-accelerated nodes you want. As you change these numbers, the numbers for your power feed, cooling, and networking change as well, and often not linearly, but a step function. You decide on a given network configuration that supports 20,000 nodes - but adding another 100 nodes requires a redesign of the network and another half-million dollars in gear.You argue with the vendor about acceptance criteria - what testing you plan to do to ensure the delivered system is usable for its intended purpose. They of course want the bar set as low as possible, and you want to insist on top performance before you pay for it.Oh - and those last 3 paragraphs? You’re doing all of that *multiple* times - once for each vendor still in the running for constructing this system. Expect anywhere from 9 to 18 months of this before you’ve settled on a vendor and a configuration. And you hit snags like “The vendor can’t actually make us a written proposal, because the server they want to use is a yet-unreleased product” (Yes, that actually happened to us, and required aOnce you get through all that, all that’s left is to sign some paperwork, and manage the install project, from completion of the power and cooling to arrival of multiple tractor trailers of cargo, to figuring out how to get the crane that will set the megawatt diesel backup generator under the elevated walkway over the pavement.Of course, there will be lots of snags along the way - everything from cables showing up with a different length than ordered, to Infiniband cards with firmware that doesn’t play nice with the release of OFED software you have, to…Finally, after 2 to 5 years of work, you’ll finally have the supercomputer.

A function unit could take another operand every other cycle.From a Multiply-Add (very frequently done in Linear Algebra and computing polynomials)A CDC 7600 had one Floating Add unit which had a delay of 4 cycles.The computing of a multiply-add is a minimum of 9 cycles.PowerPC 601 had fused multiply-add pipe line with a delay of 4 cycles for double precision (64 bit word).
