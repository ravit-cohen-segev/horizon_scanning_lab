Well, it's actually three nearly identical computers.  They all run at the same time, and at any one time, one of them will be considered the primary, another the backup, and the third a standby.  There are an additional forty or so lower level MDMs responsible for systems or hardware.The Russian segment has a computer called the ЦВМ (Центральная вычислительная машина) (central computing machine).  Well, it's actually three nearly identical computers, too.  They operate a little differently, though.  They operate simultaneously and tasks may be assigned to the different lanes.The C&C runs the US segment and the ЦВМ runs the Russian segment.  The two computers are connected to each other via 1553 control buses.  The C&C is the bus controller.These computers are built into the vehicle and, through the tiered network of MDMs, are physically connected to all of the integrated vehicle hardware.  They run the flight software.Telemetry and Command Interface ComputersThe crew do not directly interface with the vehicle management computers - they have no displays or keyboards.  On the US segment, commanding to the vehicle is done using laptops called PCS (Portable Computer System).  They run on a Linux operating system and are connected to the vehicle 1553 system as remote terminals.  There are usually seven PCS laptops deployed throughout the vehicle.On the Russian Segment there are about seven equivalent laptops called, simply, ""Russian Laptops"".  They, too, are Linux based, and are used to command the Russian elements.Both the PCS and Russian Laptop use their own graphical interfaces that depict the ISS and the crew click on the module they wish to interact with and the system, and then the specific piece of hardware.Here's an example of a system page (my old system, Motion Control):This screen gives a health and status overview of the Motion Control Group (combined US MCS and RS СУДН).  Starting from this screen, the crew can access and control any piece of guidance, navigation, control, and propulsion hardware and software on the vehicle (well, Russian hardware commanding would need to be done from their laptop).Support ComputersMost of the remaining laptops are part of the Ops Lan network.  They are called SSC (Station Support Computers).  They are Windows based and are not connected to the ISS 1553 system.  They are used for everything from viewing procedures, performing supply inventory, recording notes, sending e-mail, video conferencing, on down to Twitter.In the above picture, three laptop screens are visible.

3,"When the ISS was being designed, they wisely concluded that installing physical interfaces into the structure of the ISS was not a good idea.  It's very hard to upgrade and/or repair interfaces that are part of the vehicle, whereas if laptop computers are used, upgrading/repair is as simple as launching a CD-ROM, uploading a file, or replacing the laptop.  So, with the exception of emergency hardware (e.g. ventilation valves), comm panels, and a limited set of other hardware, almost all vehicle commanding is done via a laptop interface.There are, last time I checked, about 80 laptops deployedWhen the ISS was being designed, they wisely concluded that installing physical interfaces into the structure of the ISS was not a good idea.

The idea being that a passenger would fly from a local airport to a larger airport and join the A380 to travel onwards to another large airport, ending their journey there or travelling onwards to another local airportBoeing on the other hand, envisioned that passengers would want to go direct from their local airport to their destination. They also had ideas that due to rising fuel prices and the worries around the damage to the climate, that making a fuel efficient aircraft would be the way to go.The A380 due to its size needs additional infrastructure, and as such needs the space that 2 aircraft needs. Meaning that airports had to make special gates or merge gates to cope with a specific type of aircraft. The A380 therefore can only operate to a limited number of destinations. For example, there are only 5 Airports in the U.K. that can accept an A380, and only 14 in the US. This wouldn’t be an issue if Airbus’ idea of Hub to Hub travel had taken off.The reality is that the opposite happened. Airlines didn’t want to spend so much on a giant plane that they could only use on certain routes when passengers wanted to fly direct from their home airport to their destination. The A380s that are flying today are rarely full, the only operators that are truly making a profit from them are the Middle East carriers, such as Emirates, as their location means they are perfect for transcontinental travel. Other airlines, like Virgin Atlantic and Qantas are cancelling their A380 orders as they can’t make it work. Their customers want point to point travel, rather than the hassle of stopping over at other airports.I hope this has explained how the A380 flopped.

Imagine how worse this congestion is going to get in 5–10 years.Proof of how succeful their A380 business model is?Emirates flies 9 A380s into London each day. 9 A380s. That’s a total of 4400 seats.On top of the successful business model for how Emirates works with big hubs and big passengers numbers, the A380 is also a huge selling point.This was from vice president for operations Hubert Frach:The superjumbo has a strong appeal. Super spacious and airy cabin, monumental staircase, the size of the plane itself…Also consider the appeal for Business & First class. Airlines make money mainly out of their top-end product. And the A380 gives Emirates the ability to offer the best premium classes. And again, that is strong selling point.“I’m flying first, who do I go with? Oh, Emirates hasIn the end, Emirates fully understood how to make money out of the A380, how to exploit it and get the max out of it. They built their business model on it, and it’s rewarding them with colossal profits, despite huge investments being done at the same time!And if 142 A380s weren’t enough, they’re ready to order another 50 if Airbus just strips on them the latest fuel-efficient Rolls Royce Trent engine.Emirates nailed it with the A380.In the end, quoting Sir. Tim Clark again, “It’s not Airbus fault if airlines can’t make money out of this plane. It’s the airlines fault, due to their old & failing business model”—- And this one is for all the A380 haters and critics—How can you not",0 followers,Lou Wild,3.6K,263,1.2M,https://www.quora.com/What-are-computers-used-for-on-the-ISS

Spending a lot of money for a handful of additional sales isn’t a great idea.*They reached production break-even, where they were selling aircraft for more than it cost to produce them, in 2015, and severely cut the production rate in 2017 (which forced them to spread a bunch of fixed costs over fewer airframes).

Hub and spoke is done everywhere else, and nobody is saying out loud what the forecasts are for Emirates. Many agree that the need for a very large airplane will return in 15–25 years, but that it should have two or three engines, carbon composites for the fuselage and wings, a single deck, and wingtips that fold up so that it is possible to fly everywhere else. The 777 will likely suffice for quite a long time. What you don’t see with the A380 are the six narrow bodies that bring passengers to the big airport and back out to the destinations. That’s 12 additional engines to make 20, 18 more landing gears to make 23, and 24 more tires to make 46. You cannot run the A380 without feeders. The big twins can go wherever the passengers want to get on and to wherever they want to get off, in one go, without feeders, 2 engines, 3 gears and 14 tires.",47 followers,Simon Anderson,1.1K,931,884.3K,https://www.quora.com/In-Emirates-Airbus-A380-what-is-the-space-under-the-stairs-used-for-kindly-see-comments-for-details

In 2010 when the poo hit the fan due how they were over leveraged, Fidelity/Pro Build stepped in and bought them as an asset sale. I was 60 at the time and well paid, as I should. Once the sale was announced and the hand off meeting scheduled, I ask if I would be taken care of to the owner and Lord Fauntleroy (who was staying with the new owners) . They assured I would be taken care of due to my “loyal” work in their interest. I did all the inventory, equipment assets, personnel assessments, signed it off with Pro Builds auditors and sat back ready to get going. I found out Pro Build couldn’t pour piss out of a boot with instructions on the heel. I could not believe how they paid bonuses based on the cost of assets to the Presidents and VPs. WTH ? Numbers were seriously fudged. We were selling dead trees not operating union retirement funds or 401 Ks investments. I got called to a breakfast meeting with Lord Fauntleroy and a VP for Pro Build. I show up in my company Yukon XL, and as I walk in the door there is a HR head shed sitting with them. Bad vibes for sure. They proceeded to tell me I was no longer needed, and they would be taking possession of my company truck right there and I would not be allowed back in my office to recover my boxes of personal reference materials, or IT downloads I had used for over 25 years. I was breathing fire but held my tongue, and calmly stated, I am walking out the door and driving the rig home to unload my belongings. I put average 60 to 80k on that rig on I 5, at about 1200 to 1400 hours per year. I pretty much lived it creating the business. Offered me a sign out with one months severance. I got up, and started to the door and they said you have to stop, I asked them which one of them think they could stop me? I stated I would return in the morning at 6 am with the cleaned out rig, ready to sign out my termination papers, to recover my personal items in my office, along with the law officers I worked with in the area if needed. Got up walked out. They sat there with their stupid looks and I got in the rig drove home, returned in the morning at the designated time with the LT from the state police on standby. Got my materials and left them a bottle of Curevo saying you jokers will be loosing a billion a year soon. True words. In the end it cost me everything I had worked for to be able to retire. 2014 at 64 I did a straight 7. I still would like to meet Little Lord Fauntleroy in an alley for 5 minutes. Was then and am now you bet. I just need to vent finally.",950 followers,Brian Johnson,6K,70,611K,https://www.quora.com/What-are-computers-used-for-on-the-ISS

The company was being completely rebranded, bespoke tailoring and all the traditional things were going out the window and a new, modern menswear and womenswear company was being born…..“Hepworths” became “Next"" (35 years on it's still trading successfully under this name)No space in this new company for faithfull old timers like Mr Chambers.So he was made redundant and told to return his company car, He was devastated.His severance package was sorted while the Hepworths brand was wound down.When the stores were changing into their new style, He was asked to bring his car back to the old head office (also closing) in Leeds.He asked what was the plan to get him home to Preston (about 70 miles) after he'd handed his car back. He was told that getting home was his affair as handing the car back was the end of his association with the company.So he set off towards Leeds, in the car.A while later he phoned the company, from motorway services (no mobile phones back then) and told them he was ok for a lift home, as his wife had followed him in their car.They said, ok , but whens he bringing the car back?He answered oh, sorry its run out of petrol on the M62 (motorway) Its on the hard shoulder, but I'm not sure where exactly.I've locked it up safely, before my wife got me in our car, but I'm afraid I seem to have dropped both sets of keys somewhere!So that was his parting shot, none of us ever found out when or how they found and recovered the car!",88 followers,Edward Kwang,1.1K,98,442.7K,https://www.quora.com/What-are-computers-used-for-on-the-ISS
16,"About 20 years ago, my friend’s father had to go out on disability and they took back his company truck with all of HIS tools in the back and refused to return them. This went back and forth for at least 6 months. I know for a fact that he purchased most of it on his own because I drove him to the store and back and helped him load up the truck many times but he “Somehow” procured a key to the company lot and he, my friend and I backed up my Jeep and just emptied the entire truck into it. He swears he owned ALL of it but I’m not sure…",UNKNOWN,Cory A. Martin,2.6K,956,7.8M,https://www.quora.com/What-are-computers-used-for-on-the-ISS

If it was found to be over $1000 worth of property it would be a felony charge, suddenly my boss was more than willing to allow the officer and myself back to get my tools, it was a pretty easy thing to accomplish sorting out what was mine and what was theirs as all of my tools have all 3 of my initials engraved on them and our company had their name engraved on all of theirs. The officer also noticed that there were cameras that overlooked where the trucks were parked and made them go back and show him the footage from the time that I returned the truck to the time that we went back to get my stuff to make sure that they hadn’t tried to remove anything of mine in that time, which they hadn’t.

There are many in the crypto world, but here I share the ones that, in my opinion, offer the best benefits:Coinomi Wallet: One of the best-known wallets. It offers support for various blockchain assets, tokens, even exclusive coins, and some fiat currencies, and is quite secure.Divi Wallet: launched by the Divi Project and designed by its Divi Labs with an extremely friendly interface, where users have a new and dynamic way of interacting with Divi and with the main crypto and fiat currencies in a very secure and at the same time very easy way, providing a decentralized option to store the private keys of your cryptocurrencies in one place, making it one of the most secure wallets today. You can check theirLedger Wallet. It's safe and can store a large variety of cryptos and also allows us to store our private keys.The objective then, s to diversify our forms of storage to reduce risk and maintain a clear and constantly evolving strategy. In this way, the money is always ""working"" and, above all, safe.Always remember to constantly educate yourself because the crypto world is super dynamic!","3,397 followers",Raymond Scottman,1.1K,0,0,https://www.quora.com/What-are-computers-used-for-on-the-ISS
