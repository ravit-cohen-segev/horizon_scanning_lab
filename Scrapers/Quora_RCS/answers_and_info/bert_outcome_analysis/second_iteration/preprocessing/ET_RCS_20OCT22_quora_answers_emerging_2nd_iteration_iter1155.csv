This term is reserved only for short-skirted, cleavage-showing temptresses, not the men who willingly cheat.Sure, this woman may have known that your man wasn’t single, but it’sWe need to stop teaching these kind of men that this behavior is acceptable and that they can’t control themselves.Hold them accountable.",47 followers,Deepak Mishra,6.1K,2.4K,138.2M,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-current-trends-in-IT-industry

All that’s happening is that people are putting more computers inside of things that probably shouldn’t have computers and then putting them on the Internet. Do you REALLY need a processor in your fridge? In your toaster? In your stove? How is that a win?Second, remember that the S in IoT is for security.Wait, there’s no S in IoT.Exactly my point.

All of the IoT devices that are about to become smart are about to become gigantic security problems.Have you noticed that your laptop operating system vendor issues a security update about once a month? And that you have to upgrade and reboot your laptop?Well, guess what, your smart appliances are going to be in the exact same situation. There are going to be tons of security holes that are discovered over time. And are the vendors going to generate updates for their devices? So far, it’s really looking to be Not Good. I have a few smart devices already. I don’t see updates. Are other vendors going to be better about issuing updates and fixing bugs? It seems doubtful.What happens when everyone’s home has a thousand computers in it, all of which have some giant well-known vulnerabilities in them? That’s the distant future that we can foresee. Every house is part of a giant botnet. DDoS attacks with orders of magnitude more bandwidth than today. And we won’t even talk about the increased power consumption.Welcome to my nightmare: the Internet of Insecurity.","6,727 followers",Barsha Sedhain,88.9K,127,7.5M,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-current-trends-in-IT-industry

It is designed to show very simple basic information in one of your eye. It can show you simple messages like directions or notifications. It works over Bluetooth with either an Android phone or an iPhone much in the same way your smartwatch does, taking commands from an app that runs in the background to control it. If there is any notification it can be read or dismissed using certain head gestures.It has little red monochrome projector. that shines an image on the holographic mirror which bounces it directly into the eyeball.Notification can only be seen if you are look down at the display. It does interfere with the standard line of vision.This was the technology which every college kids dreamt and now Intel has finally built it.﻿Thankyou",0 followers,Lucas Martin,6.4K,65,4.2M,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-current-trends-in-IT-industry

As per study by Zinnov, there are now more than 400+ IoT platforms and the market is super fragmented.If you mean how do I create a simple IoT solution then I can advise you in depth but assuming you still want to create a platform lets understand few key categories of platforms in the market and their role in the IoT ecosystem.Seriously, another IoT platform, please be very thoughtful before working on to develop one.

9,"No, the promise of the Internet of Things isn't for everybody, it's for the elite, the powers-that-be, the masters of puppets, the controllers of information.When you use a Nest thermostat there are a few things happening:No, the promise of the Internet of Things isn't for everybody, it's for the elite, the powers-that-be, the masters of puppets, the controllers of information.When you use a Nest thermostat there are a few things happening:When you think about the practical promise of IoT, which is putting a dollar's worth of computing in hundreds of little things around you, it's natural to think about how much power that gives you. Except, you won't actually have control of those things. Just like you don't really have control of your Nest thermostat. Sure, you can turn the dummy dial up or down, but you don't control how it works, when it's powered up to collect or send data, what kind of data it sends, to whom, or what they do with it. It's in your home, watching what you do, kind of doing what it wants, and there are layers of software between the buttons you press and the things it does, and those layers are controlled by other people in that Google building whom you'll never meet.The joy of using Internet of Things products is that the complexity of managing hundreds of little sensors and robots will be hidden from you, tucked elegantly behind some colorful and fun-to-read social app that is many, many steps removed from actually controlling those devices.When Nest got bought for $3.2b it wasn't because it was selling a lot of thermostats. Selling thermostats is a crappy, marginally profitable business. Most people go their whole lives without ever buying a thermostat. If they do buy one, they sure as hell aren't going to be brand-loyal, and if they are it's going to be to Honeywell which owns 50% of the entire US market. It sure as hell isn't for selling smoke alarms, which is far, far less profitable and lucrative than the thermostat industry, and for which their first version of widely released product got entirely recalled.Nest got bought for $3.2b by Google - a company that literally takes everything it knows about you and then sells that to advertisers - because it strapped an information collection device onto the back of a thermostat and sold it to a few million rich people.So no, everybody won't be able to interact with Internet of Things in the future. The Internet of Things will mostly seem like ""smart"" devices; they'll just turn on when you walk into a room. And then they'll tell somebody about it. All the real interaction happens somewhere else.",3 followers,Mithun Naik,7.2K,0,0,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-current-trends-in-IT-industry
