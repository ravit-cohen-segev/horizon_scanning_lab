Useful nuclear fusion that consistently puts out more energy than it consumes in operation has turned out to be hard.Right now there is no utility-scale electricity produced by fusion power other than renewables that are ultimately powered by the big fusion reaction in the sky. Those renewables keep getting cheaper and more reliable, making competitively-priced electricity from terrestrial fusion less likely to be competitive in future.When people ask about the prospects for nuclear fusion power, the answer has traditionally been “25 to 50 years away” from when ever you ask. In the 1960’s nuclear fusion power was 25 to 50 years away, in the 1990’s nuclear fusion power was 25 to 50 years away. Today? Park that thought.Where are we today? I’d say much closer. We have a much better understanding (thanks to the many experimental fusion reactors already built) of what it will take to make a useful nuclear fusion reactor. The technology and engineering are coming together, but slowly.It seems to me thatHowever, when I imagine something larger and more complex than ITER, I don’t see cheap electricity. I see something that looks a lot like an existing nuclear fission power plant except maybe more complicated and with larger internal losses. Given that nuclear fission power plants are struggling to compete right now, I just don’t see something that is more expensive again and has a lower output will be able to produce the sorts of profit that would be required for widespread uptake.There is a possibility that one of the many other fusion experiments might actually achieve the result before ITER, but that seems unlikely to me. For example, when Lockheed Martin announced theirIn conclusion, I’m optimistic that humanity will eventually achieve “useful” nuclear fusion power, maybe even in my lifetime (but probably not). But I am pessimistic that this will ever result in a commercially competitive (or viable) way of producing utility-scale electricity.Q: To what extent could nuclear fusion power stations be the answer to all our power needs?

And obviously it is feasible, since the sun does it without any engineering at all!""Well no. First of all, the sun has half a million km thick insulation keeping the inside hot and half a million km thick deadweight pushing down from all directions keeping it compressed.Those 2 things are impossible to duplicate on Earth. Not just ""hard""; impossible.And even if they could be duplicated, then the rate of fusion inside the sun is so incredibly slow, taking around 10 billion years before a typical H fuses, that it would be utterly useless.Lots of people, even congressmen, know light-H fusion (the sun & stars) is vastly too hard and D-T fusion is much easier. So given that wide knowledge, a slightly trickier lie was needed.Sadly D and especially T are not so easily acquired as ordinary hydrogen. Indeed T (tritium) does not even exist on Earth (except perhaps for ultra microscopic quantities produced occasionally by cosmic rays or something). So then, according to a myth widely circulated to suckers by fusion-propagandists and con-men, we can solve humanity's energy problems easy-peasy by extracting deuterium (D) and lithium from SEAWATER (practically infinite supply!), convert lithium to tritium (T), then do D+T fusion; only waste products are harmless (and actually useful) helium, so just be incredibly happy and fund fusion research with $100 billions please forever!But that all is a lie that never will work, and anybody competent should know it never will work. Let me explain.First of all, even with D and T, the easiest fusion reaction, if you simply accelerate D in a cyclotron and fire it at a T target (or vice versa) then you will NOT get enough fusion energy produced to pay for the cost of acceleration. This experiment has been tried at every conceivable speed. None work, not even with a hypothetical 100% efficient cyclotron, at any setting whatever. So the only possible way to make D+T fusion work is to keep your D&T hot (costing zero energy once you have it hot, if your insulation is 100% effective) allowing multiple collision attempts not just one. That'd work fine except that no insulation yet devised has been anywhere near good enough, and the hot D+T want to explode out of there, not stay where you want it to stay. The best anybody has come up with to overcome that is to keep making your fusion reactors bigger & thicker, so it takes longer for D+T to leave and so you effectively get more insulation keeping the heat in there longer. The sizes then become enormous making it ultra expensive.Now let's look at the nuclear reactions we need. (Notation: D = deuterium = H-2, T = tritium = H-3.) The fusion reaction isD + T --> He-4 + n + 17.59 MeV (1)by far the easiest fusion reaction -- which means it is so vastly difficult that nobody has ever come close to achieving ""break even"" (despite several widely circulated published lies, told to the US government and general public about this, saying break-even already happened, it in fact never did, nor even came close, not even with various lying fake-redefinitions of the term “breakeven”).The ingredients needed are D which is naturally present in the oceans -- about 1 atom D per 6420 light-hydrogen atoms. And T: that unfortunately is very dangerous stuff, since radioactive with halflife 12.32 years.I used to live near the Princeton tokomak, and they told many lies to the public. (For example the lie that they had achieved “breakeven.”) One of their utterly irresponsible stunts was to run with D+T causing their entire incredibly huge and expensive reactor to become radioactive and hence no longer safely usable, which was a total waste of a vast amount of money to accomplish nothing since they could have just run with pure D; no safety risk that way, and results easily extrapolated to D+T so same science benefits, and in fact way more science benefits since reactor would keep being usable.But no, they had to go for the publicity stunt rather than acting responsibly -- which they did to try to con people into giving them funding.They told everybody the planned run was no risk and they were totally safe and there was no chance any T would leak. Bingo: First thing they then did was leak 100% of their enormous tritium supply (over a hundred pounds) irreversibly into the Princeton-Plainsboro environment, which was a vast amount of radiation, enough to kill every human on earth many times over (if that tritium were oxidized to water & fed to all humans in equal portions, they’d all die within a week).They then told everybody not to worry about it. Their story was it all went into the upper atmosphere far away. Unless it did not, since it burned, or was catalyzed, to form water -- a possibility they never ever mentioned to the media, not even for one word. Did they then go around putting up radiation detectors all over the Princeton-Plainsboro area to monitor to make sure their story was actually valid? No, of course not. That might risk revealing that something other than their story might be true, and that in turn might endanger their funding. Instead they tried to keep it all pretty quiet. My guess is about 75% of the people who lived in that area did not even know the leak happened.The tritium is produced fromn + Li-6 --> He-4 + T (2)That neutron (n) comes from a fission reactor. The fusion propagandists often lie and say fusion produces no radioactive waste (lie) and no proliferation risks since no fission reactors anymore so no longer will plutonium be widely available. That is also a lie since as we see you NEED a fission reactor to do reaction (2) at all. But then there is a propaganda claim those n's can come from the fusion reaction (1). That also is a lie. First of all, that only would work if 100% of the neutrons from (1) got used for (2), which is never ever going to come anywhere close to being true. The vast majority of the n's will fly away and never go where you want, they'll instead go where they want, destroying your ultra-expensive superconductors, ultra-expensive huge containment vessel, etc etc that make today's fusion reactors cost vastly vastly more than any fission reactor ever (despite never having achieved breakeven).I.e. the inefficiency in terms of neutron percent used versus wasted, will be huge. That will force the use of fission to generate the vast majority of the T. This means D+T fusion cannot, not even in principle, outlast fission as a sustainable energy source. Ever.The planned ITER fusion reactor, which hopes to produce about a piddly 500 MW of energy in the form of heat (which then will NOT be converted to electricity and NOT used to power any, e.g, homes -- it will simply be 100% wasted -- and it will only be able to run for a time scale of minutes before it must be shut down) from allegedly 50 MW of input power -- and thus allegedly exceed breakeven for the first time -- allegedly is going to cost about $85 billion, more expensive than any power plant ever constructed before, including ones that produce far more power and which actually work. It will rapidly self-destruct due to the fast neutrons, far faster self-destruction rate than any power plant ever before (at least intentionally) had -- thus destroying that huge investment. (Also, the 50 MW input power is a total lie, and in reality will vastly exceed that. One of the standard lie-techniques they always use is to divide the input into many different parts, then dismiss all but one of those parts. Scientists in other areas would never do that and regard it as massively unethical, but in fusion it happens pretty much every time I ever see any public statement they ever make.)And note that in net D+T fusion with T from lithium would involve two n's per 17.59 MeV output, even with the fantasy of 100% neutron efficiency.That is as compared to fission, which produces about 200 MeV per two neutrons. The fast neutrons from fusion (unfortunately vastly more energetic than neutrons from fission) destroy ANYTHING they hit, converting it into radioactive waste, and actually, as we now see, vastly MORE radioactive waste is produced per joule from fusion than from fission -- at least if ""neutron count"" is regarded as our proxy for ""amount of waste"" -- exactly contrary to their lies.That also tells us that — remembering that fission is needed to get the T to even allow D-T fusion to happen — that concomitant fission will be producting about 10 times the power produced by the fusion. So given that you need to build 10 GW of fission plant for every 1 GW fusion plant even in a fantasy world where fusion really were super easy and wonderful, why the hell even build those fusion plants at all??But ok, let's just focus on that Li-6. Natural lithium is 7.5% (atom fraction) lithium-6, with the rest being Li-7. (Lithium-6 has an atomic mass of 6.015 amu; lithium-7 has an atomic mass of 7.016 amu. The atomic mass of natural lithium is 6.941 amu.) T is made from Li-6.Seawater contains 0.18 milligrams of lithium per liter. Let us assume that separating that lithium from that liter of water, AND from everything else (i.e. all the other salts) in that water, AND purifying it, AND removing whatever the Li is chemically bonded to (e.g. chloride), AND isotopically separating into Li-6 versus Li-7... all together costs energy at least equivalent to the cost of EVAPORATING that 1 kg of water, i.e. 2.4 megajoules. I suspect that estimate is conservative, but admit I have not carefully considered the numerous unknown cleverest-possible separation schemas, partly since nobody can, since they are unknown.For anybody who insists on trying, I point out that at present, salt is commercially produced from seawater (vastly most commonly) by evaporation -- i.e. despite 2000 years of doing this commercially and research on same, no lower-cost method has come along that has taken over the sea-salt industry. And salt is way easier to get out of seawater than lithium: no need to purify, no need to isotopically enrich, don't need chemical reactions, thousands of times greater concentration. (Albeit most salt is NOT produced from seawater; instead it is mined, since producing from seawater is uneconomical by comparison. Total world salt production each year greatly exceeds total world lithium reserves for all time.)The 17.59 MeV output by reaction (1) per atom of T, or equivalently per atom of Li-6, is equivalent to 2.8*10^14 joules per kg of Li-6, i.e. equivalent to 1.8*10^13 joules per kg of natural lithium, i.e. 3.3 megajoules per liter of seawater.Now, assume your fusion reactor is at best 50% efficient. This is a very very very conservative estimate since the best fossil-fuel power plants ever made feature about 50% efficiency, and fusion is way harder, so far fusion has never achieved any positive efficiency whatsoever, not even 0.000001%.WE ARE DONE: the energy cost of obtaining the Li-6 from 1 liter of seawater, is lower bounded by 2.4 MJ. But the energy we get out of it is upper bounded by 1.6 MJ. Oops.IN OTHER WORDS: The ""we can get the Li from seawater"" claim is yet another widespread lie from fusion propagandists exposed by the pre-college-level calculation I just performed.CONCLUSION: you cannot do it by getting lithium from seawater.If we have to get it from lithium ore: the total known world reserves of lithium ore are small, about 2 million tonnes. That's considerably smaller than uranium reserves. In other words the whole lie that the ingredients needed for fusion energy are ""common"" and ""cheap"" and it is better than fission, and will keep us going longer, is all utter garbage.POSSIBLE ESCAPE ROUTE: Can you get the lithium not from seawater, nor ore, but instead from average rocks? The good news is Li abundance in earth crustal rocks is about 20 milligram per kg, i.e. about 100 times its abundance in seawater per kg. But unfortunately it is harder to extract Li from rocks than from seawater, since for one thing melting rock is a lot harder than boiling seawater. You could try to extract the Li by means of repeated cycles of remelting with fractional crystallization... I tend to doubt this will work too well... or: dissolving in acids, again with fractional crystallization could be tried (multiple cycles), then trying to recycle the waste products... I would guess that might work better... and then we need to isotopically separate...So it is highly unclear to me what the cost would be, since as far as I know nobody has ever seriously tried to extract lithium from either granite or seawater before, since both are incredibly stupid and uneconomical. That is because every mining operation that has ever been undertaken, after 1000s of years of trying, that is trying to extract something with parts-per-million concentration levels, has yielded a VERY EXPENSIVE product, and energy use is a big reason why it is so expensive. For example, gold ore in today's mines typically features concentration of 5 milligram gold per kg of ore. Know how much gold costs? Currently about $1971 per troy ounce, which is $63 per gram. Gold is quite easy to separate from ore, lithium from granite would be chemically much harder. So I might conjecture that lithium extracted from average rock, e.g. granite, would cost about $300 per gram in year-2020 dollars, which at the current price of electricity ($0.133 per kW-hr USA year-2020 average) is equivalent to 8 gigajoules of energy to perform that mining & extraction of 1 gram. I am guessing the isotopic separation will raise that $300/gram cost for rock-lithium up to about $400/gram. This is all a very rough and conjectural guess-calculation.But anyhow, a gram of lithium contains 0.075 grams of Li-6, which yields 140 gigajoules of fusion energy assuming 50% efficiency. So that (since 140>11) actually sounds promising.It would be a fairly difficult and large exercise to try to figure out the best possible cost to extract Li from ordinary rock and redo my rough calculation last paragraph justifiably correctly; and that is an effort which the fusion community simply has never lifted a finger to even start trying to do even after 70 years. That is because lying is easier and more profitable for them than actually doing research.You may be getting the impression I have an attitude of tremendous contempt for fusion research. That is correct. They are the worst. They have lied and lied for 70 years, including under oath, have a worse record of failure and lies than almost any (perhaps all) other fields of science, and they continue to lie still while still having accomplished absolutely nothing after 70 years despite more funding than almost anything. Throughout those 70 years their perpetual refrain has been in 10-20 years they'll supply us with limitless energy too cheap to meter. Then when it does not happen they say ""Oh, don't blame us, there were really really complicated unexpected problems nobody could have anticipated, but we understand all that now, so just fund us 10-20 more years to reach the land of milk and honey!"" Which was always a lie. In fact, those problems were very easy, not hard, to anticipate, BUT their livelihood depended on not anticipating them and pretending they would not exist, so they covered their eyes.And the truth, which they almost never say out loud, is that to have any hope of having any use, fusion would have to be based on a NEUTRONLESS reaction, such as B+H fusion. Only neutronless reactions can work without rapidly turning your ultra-expensive fusion plant into radioactive waste rendering it un-economical at a level beyond belief.So: not D+D, not T+D, not H+H+H+H, not almost any fusion reaction almost anybody ever hears about in fusioneering propaganda -- none are acceptable and everybody competent has always known that.But B+H is vastly vastly harder than D+T fusion (and boron is even rarer than lithium!), probably 10000 times as hard, hence vastly vastly further from ever happening, which is why they hardly ever talk about it.It would be bad for their funding if that truth were better known; and their primary desire is to lie and deceive to keep the funding train going. They do not give a crap about scientific ethics, the future of humanity and the ultimate usefulness of it all. All they care about is lying to the gullible to get more funding. I have read many government ""reports to president"", transcripts of scientist testimony to congress, public educational brochures put out by Princeton Plasma lab, etc where the lies above (& others! What I have mentioned is the tip of the iceberg) are baldly stated as ""facts.""I cannot tell whether they actually are so incompetent that they believe their own lies, or whether they lie fully intentionally. All I know is they lie, and those lies can be exposed by pre-college level calculations, and they keep on repeating those lies for 50 years, to people like presidents and congressmen whom they correctly figure will not do said calculations. I find it appalling.Many scientists know this reality, I presume -- but most are too wimpy to say it aloud and risk that an attempt will be made, backed up by enormous money and influence, to damage their careers. I however, am not one of those wimps. I've been saying this stuff my entire career, probably to its detriment, and with apparently no useful effect on the US government, which like an idiot turned off all funding for breeder fission research (an actually workable idea, but it will take many years of experimenting to make it get good -- crucial years our government has idiotically sacrificed) so that it instead could focus exclusively on fusion quackery.8 Aug 2021 News Flash:Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory’s (LLNL’s) National Ignition Facility (NIF) allegedly achieved ""ignition"" (of DT fusion fuel pellet using lasers) for the first time, producing a 1.3 MJ explosion. This allegedly exceeded the laser energy going into the pellet by a factor of 5 and broke the old energy record by a lot. Great accomplishment? No: As their scientist Omar A. Hurricane fully admitted:(A) That 1.3 MJ was only a tiny fraction of the electrical energy that powered NIF's lasers. It is sort of like a stone age man declaring to the media that he’s “invented fire” if the amount of energy he can get out of the fire is far tinier than the amount of energy he uses rubbing sticks together.(B) Zero of the ""produced"" 1.3 MJ energy was actually used to generate usable power. But even if 100% was somehow used, this would still be a total failure as a way to generate energy (see A).(C) Yes, 1.3 MJ allegedly exceeded the laser energy(D) And indeed (just in case you thought that was not “typical”) in 2013 NIF also had announced “ignition” and “breakeven” after producing a 14 kJ explosion of a pellet, powered by a 1.8 MJ laser flash as input. Note how the output was over 100X smaller than the input. Notice how now, in the 2021 Proclamation of First Ever Glorious Success they did not mention, at all, their 8 year earlier Proclamation of Glorious Success, which they now laugh at as a pathetic con job, except they do not, they just evidently now pretend it never happened.But still, (C) sounds like a notable milestone that might enable them to experimentally study ignition.More (independent of me) people who have similar opinions and/or similarly disturbing facts:Physicist Sabine Hossenfelder with a youtube video:The “New Energy Times” founded by journalist S.B.Krivit exposes many facts about fusion research and outrageous cons involved in it - in particular ITER:","105,625 followers",Dave Consiglio,508,6.8K,91.4M,https://www.quora.com/To-what-extent-could-nuclear-fusion-power-stations-be-the-answer-to-all-our-power-needs-Could-it-be-cheap-and-constantly-available-What-would-the-outcome-be

It is remarkable that we (as a species) are even attempting it and more remarkable that we may well succeed.People seem to think that fusion is relatively easy, but it really isn’t. Even in the core of the sun, fusion generates only a small amount of net heat. A cubic metre of the sun’s fusing core only generates around 275 watts. That’s less energy output than we give off as body heat for an equivalent volume. The reason why the sun is so hot is because there are hundreds of thousands of miles of insulation (in the form of hot gas contained by gravity) around this heating centre.There’s a reason stars burn for billions of years, they really only burn slowly.Now consider the conditions at the core of the sun - 250 billion atmospheres, 15 million degrees (K or C doesn’t matter at this scale). And that is sufficient to make a piddly amount of heat per cubic metre. Scaled down to operations that would fit on Earth, that’s not going to cut it for power generation. You’d get more power out of a single large solar panel in good conditions. (That might seem odd but consider the sheer size of the sun, even “just” the core region).What’s more, we can’t achieve those sorts of pressures so we need much higher temperatures before we even start fusion; closer to 100 million degrees. We then need to surround this heating zone with the kind of insulation a few hundred thousand miles worth of mind-bogglingly dense gas and plasma provides (using superpowered magnets), and then we have to extract sensible energy without causing the whole reaction to stall and still end up with enough energy to outweigh the inevitable energy losses.I hope this gives you an idea of what an achievement creating a working fusion power plant will be.

Efficient fusion devices can be built over a very wide range of yields.Unlike fission which produces an exponentially increasing run away chain reaction when super critical and will only allow a fission primary with a critical mass (or more) of fissile material to be formed;fusion is actually a plasma burn that takes an orderly, predictable, finite (short) amount of time to take place. In an efficient geometry, like a slightly tapered cylinder, yields of different size can be produced by just changing the length of the cylinder holding DT or DD fusion fuel.Are there actual applications for really large devices?(A minority view)Nuclear weapons technology has some value -toWhat if one of the millions of asteroids in our solar system was on a collision course with the Earth?What would we do?How would we react?Tracks of known mapped asteroids larger than 100 meters in size that intersect earth’s orbit.One rogue asteroid could end all human development and extinguish all life which has evolved on planet earth over the course of 2.5 billion years in a few brief seconds.If asteroids with trajectories that will strike earth are discovered early and the objects small enough, several non-nuclear mediation strategies can be proposed. Technology like large lasers orbiting in space, human and robotic intercept missions to set up small nuclear reactors to melt the asteroid surface producing thrust, or perhaps bombardment by hyper kinetic projectiles fired from earth orbit could be used to break up and deflect moderate sized asteroids.If large asteroids are discovered late as they approach earth, thermonuclear explosives could be key to defending all life on planet earth. A late detected near earth asteroid would probably be best and most reliably be deflected from collision with earth using large high-yield peaceful nuclear explosives.Would it not make some sense to expend some effort and dedicate very modest appropriations to prepare a few large planetary defense devices and engineer a delivery system to securely intercept and deflect a late discovered oncoming killer asteroid of greater than 100 meters in size on a trajectory with earth?The actual peaceful nuclear explosive technology selected would be up to designers, but D-D fusion implemented in a multi-stage fission-fusion-fusion device has produced the largest devices successfully tested on earth and would probably be the best initial technology to consider when trying to design very large defensive peaceful thermonuclear explosives for planetary defense. A shock initiated fusion secondary that initiated a thermonuclear detonation wave in a tappered cylinder of cryo-deuterium liquid held under high pressure is scaleable for yield over a very wide range. Such multistage thermonuclear devices could easily produce yields hundreds of times larger than the largest experimental thermonuclear device ever tested on earth.Picture of a two stage peaceful thermonuclear explosive device. Initiation of the spherical primary, traditionally a fission device but today, potentially a small sphere containing DT fusion fuel, which produces a shock thermonuclear detonation wave in a tuneable yield cylindrical fusion secondary.If a large asteroid is bearing down on earth and is only a few weeks out, there may not be time to design and build specialized nuclear explosives appropriate to counter the threat to all life on earth. It might be wiser and more prudent to arrange to have in readiness a few devices prepared but perhaps unfueled to use in the event an asteroid on a collision path with earth is detected.Near-Earth Objects (NEOs) are comets and asteroids that have been nudged by the gravitational attraction of nearby planets into orbits that allow them to enter the Earth's neighborhood. NASA has a program for tracking objects that could collide with earth. It is unclear whether collectively our world currently has the resources and prepared engineering measures to respond to the challenge of a killer asteroid on a collision path with earth.NEO Earth Close ApproachesThe idea that the chance of a rogue comet or meteor is so small that it does not deserve consideration and planning to avoid is probably incorrect.Within this last year, a rogue meteor was discovered only days before its closest approach to earth.Asteroid 2016 RB1 was discovered on 5th September, 2016, by astronomers using the 60″ Cassegrain reflector telescope of the Catalina Sky Survey, located at the summit of Mount Lemmon in the Catalina Mountains north of Tucson, Arizona — a project of NASA’S NEO Observations Program in collaboration with the University of Arizona. 2016 RB1, a small-medium sized asteroid which was large enough to survive entry into the earth's atmosphere and would have struck the earths surface in the event of a collision safely flew past Earth September 8th at 10:20am PDT (1:20pm EDT/17:20 UTC) at a reported distance of about 25,000 miles (40,000 kilometers, or just less than 1/10th the distance of Earth to the moon). Because the asteroid’s orbit carried it below (or over) Earth’s south pole, it did not pass within the orbits of communication or weather satellites. 2016 RB1 was estimated to be between 25 to 50ft. (7 and 16m) in diameter.Asteroid misses Earth by 25,000 milesLarger asteroids passed close to earth in 2016 than the late discovered asteroid 2016 RB1 but were recognized earlier in their approach to earth. 2016 FN56 was larger, having a diameter between 115 and 280 feet.A cluster charge meteor penetrator peaceful nuclear explosive concept -The deflection of a late stage discovered meteor or comet would probably best be achieved via a multi-layered defense, with large peaceful nuclear explosives (PNE) being only one defensive element. While use of properly designed peaceful nuclear explosives could be a key technology, it would be wise and practical to back up this technology with orbiting hyper-velocity projectile launchers (rail gun projectors) and possibly large lasers to handle any remaining meteor fragments that stay on a collision trajectory with earth after use of planetary defense PNEs.Emplacement of a PNE under the surface of a rogue comet or meteor greatly increases the effectiveness of the explosive device as opposed to detonation on the surface.The US has put several decades into development of earth penetrating explosives (bunker busters) of various types.Some of the latest technology in the line of earth penetrators is the non-nuclear GBU-57A/B Massive Ordnance Penetrator (MOP) which is able to penetrate 200 feet of 5,000 psi concrete. and perhaps four times that distance in soil. Larger nuclear bunker buster weapons have also been explored. During the Bush Administration there was a Robust Nuclear Earth Penetrator (RNEP) program that, if completed, would have been many times more powerful than the successful large non-nuclear MOP device.The cluster charge earth penetrator concept - After conventional kinetic penetration, multiple cumulative charges create a narrow canal, then injects into this canal explosives which upon detonation pushes the bomb deeper into the rogue body by special rocket explosions and emplaces the device in a yet deeper location. A normal shaped charge can punch a long, narrow hole; a cluster charge is capable of shifting a much larger volume of material using an array of several charges detonated near simultaneously. This cluster charge technique can blast out an impressive forty to sixty times as much rock or concrete for the same mass of explosive.A cluster charge fission-fusion device for planetary defense could be implemented so as to split a rogue asteroid into several large chunks while employing proven earth penetrator technology. The most effective way to deliver a large peaceful nuclear explosive device is to burrow and emplace under the surface of the meteor and then cleave the body of the meteor into a couple of large chunks that deflect away from the earth and end up in the Sun or are lost to space.Life has taken over 2.5 billion years to develop and evolve on earth; yet could be snuffed out in a few brief seconds in the event of a collision with a large comet or meteor.NEW SELF-PROPELLED PENETRATION BOMBby Alexander Bolonkinhttp://www.rxiv.org/pdf/1207.0013v1.pdf","105,625 followers",Dave Consiglio,4.4K,6.8K,91.4M,https://www.quora.com/To-what-extent-could-nuclear-fusion-power-stations-be-the-answer-to-all-our-power-needs-Could-it-be-cheap-and-constantly-available-What-would-the-outcome-be

That was done by MIT.There are a number of other fusion reactor projects using a variety of different methods. These are a bit less predictable. There is a chance that one of these novel fusion reactors will work effectively and find us a cost-effective way of making fusion energy much cheaper than the ITER project and much sooner.So the main international fusion project that will replace ITER with a massive and hugely expensive reactor that may be working in another 25 years. Or the other option may be a much cheaper and novel reactor system that may produce workable power at some unknown time.There is one nuclear technology that we could develop within this decade and provide safer, cheaper and cleaner low carbon energy.A much more effective option that could give us much safer, cleaner and cheaper Generation 4 reactors. They are very different from the common fission reactors now in use around the world. Nothing like Chernobyl of Fukushima.MSR, Molten Salt Reactors have the potential to be ten times safer, cleaner and cheaper power than current PWR reactors. And they could even burn nuclear fuel waste.With enough resources, we could have some of these Next Generation, Gen 4, reactors in production within this decade.Some Gen 4 reactor designs will be able to use much of the most dangerous nuclear fuel waste as fuel. They could burn up nuclear waste and make power from it. The Terrapower project supported by Bill Gates includes an MSR, Molten Salt Reactor, and another reactor is a Wave reactor that could use depleted Uranium or unenriched Uranium or Plutonium as fuel. And there are massive amounts of depleted Uranium in storage around the world. And it is basically free to use.China is leading the world in developing Gen 4 reactors. Including a working prototype gas-cooled reactor. This is a melt-down-resistant reactor. China is also developing a prototype MSR and Wave reactor. Much of it based on US research and technology.The US has the technology to lead the world in Generation 4 nuclear power if the resources were made available.Generation 4 nuclear power will support other low carbon energy sources.Global energy demand is growing rapidly and renewable energy is unable tp keep pace with that demand.Nuclear power supplies 50% of the world's low carbon energy. And as old reactors are retired that number will drop. China and India both have massive coal problems and are planning over 50 nuclear power stations to help replace coal. They also both have massive coal reserves. Much of the growing energy demand in South East Asia is being supplied by coal. Many countries can not afford renewable energy. Currently, there are over 200 new coal-powered power stations being built in South East Asia.We need more low carbon energy options.

23,"Today, many countries take part in fusion research to some extent, led by the European Union, the USA, Russia and Japan, with vigorous programs also underway in China, Brazil, CaToday, many countries take part in fusion research to some extent, led by the European Union, the USA, Russia and Japan, with vigorous programs also underway in China, Brazil, Canada, and Korea. Initially, fusion research in the USA and USSR was linked to atomic weapons development, and it remained classified until the 1958 Atoms for Peace conference in Geneva. Following a breakthrough at the Soviet tokamak, fusion research became 'big science' in the 1970s. But the cost and complexity of the devices involved increased to the point where international co-operation was the only way forward.Fusion powers the Sun and stars as hydrogen atoms fuse together to form helium, and matter is converted into energy. Hydrogen, heated to very high temperatures changes from a gas to a plasma in which the negatively-charged electrons are separated from the positively-charged atomic nuclei (ions). Normally, fusion is not possible because the strongly repulsive electrostatic forces between the positively charged nuclei prevent them from getting close enough together to collide and for fusion to occur. However, if the conditions are such that the nuclei can overcome the electrostatic forces to the extent that they can come within a very close range of each other, then the attractive nuclear force (which binds protons and neutrons together in atomic nuclei) between the nuclei will outweigh the repulsive (electrostatic) force, allowing the nuclei to fuse together. Such conditions can occur when the temperature increases, causing the ions to move faster and eventually reach speeds high enough to bring the ions close enough together. The nuclei can then fuse, causing a release of energy.While fusion power clearly has much to offer when the technology is eventually developed, the problems associated with it also need to be addressed if it is to become a widely used future energy source.",UNKNOWN,Viktor T.
