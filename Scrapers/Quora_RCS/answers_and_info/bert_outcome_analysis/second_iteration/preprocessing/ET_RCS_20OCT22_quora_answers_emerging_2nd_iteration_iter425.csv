2,"Solar power is the only viable way of getting anything from it, and will be for far too long. We are fortunate that it is as close as it is and doubly fortunate in that it is no closer. Fusion processes here are too difficult to sustain and almost always require more energy to make happen than they yield.For earthbound nuclear processes the viable tech is molten salt reactors and we can build those, no pressure vessel required and a lot safer than the reactors we are currently using.What we desperately need are better batteries.","105,625 followers",Dave Consiglio,508,6.8K,91.4M,https://www.quora.com/How-can-we-use-nuclear-fusion-as-an-energy-source

It is remarkable that we (as a species) are even attempting it and more remarkable that we may well succeed.People seem to think that fusion is relatively easy, but itThere’s a reason stars burn for billions of years, they really only burn slowly.Now consider the conditions at the core of the sun - 250 billion atmospheres, 15 million degrees (K or C doesn’t matter at this scale). And that is sufficient to make a piddly amount of heat per cubic metre. Scaled down to operations that would fit on Earth, that’s not going to cut it for power generation. You’d get more power out of a single large solar panel in good conditions. (That might seem odd but consider the sheer size of the sun, even “just” the core region).What’s more, we can’t achieve those sorts of pressures so we need much higher temperatures before we even start fusion; closer to 100 million degrees. We then need to surround this heating zone with the kind of insulation a few hundred thousand miles worth of mind-bogglingly dense gas and plasma provides (using superpowered magnets), andI hope this gives you an idea of what an achievement creating a working fusion power plant will be. It should be considered like the Manhattan project or Apollo programme but way,It should be awe inspiring, and I hope I’ve conveyed a little of that awe.Here’s a photo of the pit in which they’re building the core at ITER. For scale, there is a person standing on the extreme left of the image about halfway down (9 o’clock position). The pressure vessel (the first section of which is complete and slowly making its way into this pit) will contain more steel than the Eiffel tower. Once running, the core will be the hottest place in the solar system, in fact it’ll be hotter than anywhere within around 100 light years of Earth as only blue supergiant stars get this hot at their cores.And ITER is just the small scale prototype. A final generating power plant will be significantly larger.I hope that blows your mind at least a little.","3,657 followers",Brent Oster,3.6K,357,1.8M,https://www.quora.com/How-can-we-use-nuclear-fusion-as-an-energy-source

My former father-in-law also worked at Lawrence Berkeley Labs, and was an engineer designing superconducting coil magnets and had decades of experience working with fusion researchers, even though his primary application was particle accelerators. From having many long conversations with these very intelligent and qualified people I realized that there are some really hard problems that block practical fusion, with no immediate solutions in sight.The only place we know of working, large-scale, energy-generating fusion reactions is at the center of a star, where the gravity of the massive star creates the necessary density, temperature, and time being held in that state at the core for fusion reactions to run continuously. This is called the Lawson criteria, and is hard to achieve. All of the layers of the star above that act as an energy exchanger, converting all the gamma rays and fast neutrons at the core into progressively less energetic wavelengths of light and motion of nuclei (heat) so by the time they reach the surface of the star, that energy is emitted as IR and visible light that heats and powers our planet's biosphere, and can provide photovoltaic energy to us as well. All of our efforts in fusion have been to try and reproduce this process on earth, in a small reactor that can provide practical energy.First I will talk aboutThe first problem with magnetic confinement is fundamental - no matter how strong or well formed the magnetic field containing the plasma is, it will always leak, as positive nuclei or ions spiralling around the magnetic field lines collide and scatter, eventually drifting out of the containment field. The only known solution is to make the reactor larger so the scattering ions take longer to travel to the plasma boundary, and thus more fusion can happen during that time. Pretty brute force.The world's most advanced magnetic confinement fusion power plant is ITER, which, to reduce the ion scattering problem mentioned above, is 6-stories tall and about the same dimension in diameter, containing the mass of 3 Eiffel towers, and it is still not expected to be large enough to contain a plasma long enough to sustain burning and produce continuous energy generation.A more practical problem is how do we extract the energy? Most of the energy in deuterium-tritium fusion reactions is released in fast, high-energy neutrons, which (because they are neutral, and have no electric charge) are not confined by the magnetic field, don't heat up the plasma, and have to be stopped by a thick shield, which then heats up, and can vaporize water to steam in order to power turbines and electrical generators. The problem is the constant bombardment by neutrons makes the shield material degrade with time, and become very radioactive, posing a problem for removal and disposal.Also, deuterium-tritium fusion reactions are currently used because they take place at the lowest energies and at the lowest plasma temperatures of all the possible fusion fuels, and thus are easier to ignite and keep lit. However, tritium is not found naturally in any significant quantities and needs to be manufactured in nuclear reactors. With today's production capacity, we just cannot make enough tritium to power even ITER continuously. We could use better fuels, like Helium-3 or Boron-11, which do not emit neutrons and thus 'burn clean', but the plasma temperature must be much higher and the confinement much better to ignite fusion and sustain it with these fuels. And while Boron-11 is plentiful, Helium-3 is so rare that scientists think that the best source of it is lunar regolith that has been irradiated for billions of years on the moon's surface. Any energy generation infrastructure that requires a regular supply of a moon-based fuel, even as energy dense as He3, will probably never work out.A proposed solution to the Tritium deficit is to construct the shield surrounding the reactor with lithium, which is abundant, and fissions into tritium when struck by neutrons, thereby 'breeding' tritium within the reactor itself. Of course, this comes with its own set of problems of how to capture, purify, and contain the tritium after it is released into the tokamak reaction chamber from the walls.Another issue is that when all of the superconducting magnets in ITER are running at full current (160,000 amps) to create the 13 Tesla toroidal magnetic field (13x that in an MRI machine) and to create the other plasma-shaping and heating fields, they are storing 60 GigaJoules, or around 12 Tons of TNT worth of energy. This is because the 180 kilometers of superconducting Niobium-Tin wires in all these massive magnet coils can carry enormous electrical current when supercooled with liquid helium.More info on the ITER magnets:But, if that cooling fails, the superconductor heats up, quenches, and becomes a normal conductor, and can no longer carry that enormous current. With 160,000 amps suddenly meeting resistance, the coil rapidly vaporizes, and causes a meltdown of the other coils, with a total energy release of 12 tons of TNT. This is very undesirable, especially when those coils are wrapped around a highly radioactive shield that also vaporizes and is expelled into the atmosphere. There are fault-detection systems, but it takes a while to dissipate that amount of energy safely, and there may not be enough time to react quickly enough in the event of a catastrophic magnet coil failure.So, some gotchas left to solve for practical fusion energy generation with magnetic confinement, with some perhaps not so easily solved.Inertial confinement fusionIt also has many of the same problems with energy conversion to electricity, and much worse wear and tear on the shielding from these small nuclear fusion explosions being set off, which also trashes all the precision equipment needed to hold the fuel pellet in the focus of the converging laser beams with extreme accuracy. So, a lot of practical damage control problems before inertial confinement fusion is a practical source of energy generation.While these problems may be solved, practical application is still a very long way off, and currently the main application of inertial confinement fusion is as an experimental testbed for calibrating computer codes used to simulate and design thermonuclear fusion weapons. As horrific as these weapons may be, the simulation codes developed for designing them (sorry maintaining them), are the one of the greatest tools for innovation in fusion energy. There is a hydrodynamics code which simulates the behavior of the fissile (and fusion) materials under extreme conditions of pressure and temperature, as well as transport codes that model neutron transport and scattering in the materials under these conditions, and many other bits and bobs. They are all standard numerical techniques, and the really classified part is the integration and calibration of all these codes with previous nuclear weapon tests from the past, and with these small scale simulations in the present.Electrostatic Confinement FusionBasically you need a vacuum container the size of a basketball and a pump to empty it. You put a small spherical wire cage the size of a golf ball in the center, and a larger wire cage the size of a bowling ball around it. You then pump out all the air, and apply a very large (10,000V) electrical potential between the two cages, with the small negative cathode at the center, and the positive anode at the periphery.Then you open a valve and let in a very small amount of Deuterium gas (commercially available) into the vacuum chamber, and it ionizes in the large voltage potential, the D+ ions in the periphery experience a very strong electric field (100K V/m), and are rapidly accelerated towards the center of the reactor, with enough energy to collide and fuse the deuterium nuclei (no tritium required). This fusion can be measured with an external neutron counter.Theoretically, power generation would be simple, as the fusion products consisting of highly energetic He3 and (few) H3 ions could be decelerated in an electric field and the current from that used to generate electricity directly.Here is ECG Herman’s excellent thesis paper on designing and constructing a Farnsworth Fusor:Although they seem like a obvious winners due to their simplicity and effectiveness, ECF reactors have several things limiting scaling:a) There is a limit to the deuterium gas density before performance degrades, so generation capacity is limited.b) Deuterium ions tend to collide with the wire cage cathode in the center, which absorbs them, heating the cage, and causing energy loss and contamination from metal atoms being dislodged.c) As the deuterium ions oscillate back and forth through the center, each time they change direction, they emit bremsstrahlung radiation, or photons of light, losing energy (this is how your dentist’s x-ray machine works).d) Scattering tends to reduce the nice, radial trajectories of the ions into a Maxwellian distribution over time, reducing the fusion that occurs.There has been work in using electromagnets at the periphery to try and hold a ball of electrons in the center, eliminating the need for a central cage… akaThermonuclear WeaponsIn the Teller-Ulam, two-stage, thermonuclear weapon, a spherical plutonium fission primary (with deuterium-tritium fusion fuel at the core to boost it) is imploded by conventional explosives, the plutonium is crushed far beyond critical density, fissions and detonates. The initial radiation released is contained and focused onto the fusion secondary to implode it, ignite fusion, and detonate it. I just mention this to illustrate the enormous energy needed to really reach the Lawson criteria in a large scale, but nuclear weapons kind of freak me out, so I'm going to refer you to the link to the Wikipedia article about them if you want to read more:Thermonuclear weapon - WikipediaSo, in summary, we should not shut down or stop building today's fission nuclear reactors, as commercial fusion reactors are not only far in the future, but also produce radioactive waste (their shielding, which needs to be periodically replaced), and Tokamaks can melt down catastrophically and explode if there is a cooling failure in the magnet coils during full power operation. They also do not run on seawater, like some say. We need expensive and difficult to produce tritium (which is also radioactive) to ignite fusion at the temperatures and densities that today's tokamak magnetic fields can produce.To advance fusion energy in your career, I think the best fields to study would be physics (classical, electrodynamics, plasma, quantum, nuclear…) and computer science, with a focus on numerical simulation. The actual physical fusion reactors are so expensive and time-consuming to build, test, and operate, that you may only get to iterate designs once or twice in a career, but computer simulations can take us in so many different directions more cheaply and easily by comparison.Perhaps there is some exotic stellarator magnetic confinement design, or advanced Farnsworth electrostatic confinement design that has not been explored in depth, that will turn out to hold the key to fusion energy. Simulation is probably the best first step to find it, unless you have a few billion dollars and several hundred kilometers of Niobium-Tin wire and helium cooling tubing to play with.Brent",UNKNOWN,Viktor T.

Maintaining those conditions for prolonged times is difficult, but it’s doable. Unfortunately, it takes a lot of energy to keep a plasma both hot and contained.“Hydrogen fusion” (actually D-D or D-T reactions) releases an incredible amount of energy. In principle, there should be enough to keep the reaction going, along with more energy we can use. The problem is that we lose enormous amounts of energy in our reactors. As soon as the plasma comes close to the reactor enclosure, it will cool. We’ve tried a few ways to handle that problem. The most well known type of fusion reactor, theSo far, we’ve been able achieve, and even go beyond, the break-even point, where energy output equals energy input.

It’s been too difficult to keep energy losses from ruining the necessary conditions.The obvious question is: can we build a fusion power generator? It’s more of an engineering problem than an scientific one, but it’s turning out to be a difficult one.

16,"Fusion does not want to occur: All atomic nuclei possess a positive charge bias due to containing protons; the resulting mutual repulsion separating nuclei must be overcome in order to fuse them.When humans attempt to perform thermonuclear fusion, we lack the energy advantage which stars possess in abundance: Reliably intense heat resultant from crushing pressures generated by the intense gravity of vast stellar mass. Without such abundant free energy at our disposal, we are forced to apply the intense interactions necessary to start and sustain thermonuclear fusion in more creative ways.

Without such abundant free energy at our disposal, we are forced to apply the intense interactions necessary to start and sustain thermonuclear fusion in more creative ways. With the exception of hydrogen bombs which are triggered via atomic fission explosives, all viable fusion devices currently consume electricity, either to power electromagnets (Tokamak's) or lasers (ICF's). At the scale of current testbeds, these mechanisms simply consume more electrical energy than they produce.Fortunately, this is a technological challenge moreso than a natural one, and there are experimental reactors on the horizon which may be large enough to break the energy deficit via economy of scale (research ITER). At the same time, cleverly elegant designs intended to convert inertial energy of quickly moving ions into augmented containment and bonus reaction energy are currently being tested (research “The Stellarator”).Depicted below, the HSX Fusion Stellarator experiment.","220,155 followers",Franklin Veaux,1.6K,47.3K,779.4M,https://www.quora.com/How-can-we-use-nuclear-fusion-as-an-energy-source

Lots of electrons zooming around. Whether they are spinning around magnetic field lines or bouncing off of nuceli, they are constantly changing speed and direction. They are constantly being accelerated. At a billion degrees, the acccelerations are massive … I can’t imagine how many g’s this would be.At any rate, accelerated charges radiate photons.

A fusion reactor thermal cycle is going to be very lucky to reach 35% efficiency. So for each kilowatt radiated away, you recover only a third of that, you can only take a third of it to use to heat the plasma.The waste heat from the turbine-generator process that makes electricity is more than the heat produced from fusion due to all those electrons racing around bouncing off of things.For Tokamak DT fusion, as DT fusion happens at the lowest temperatures of the fusion reactions, Bremsstrahlung is more of an annoyance than anything.",2 followers,Richard Muller,1.7K,2.3K,201.9M,https://www.quora.com/How-can-we-use-nuclear-fusion-as-an-energy-source
18,"When the claim ‘’thorium reactor will be more efficient than a uranium reactor” is made they are guessing. The Thorium/Uranium fuel cycle for fission reactors will come, and China and India are putting large amounts of money into developing it.But there are several problems to be overcome before it competes with or replaces the existing Uranium/Plutonium fuel cycle. One of which is simply, it can’t bootstrap itself. U-233 is created from Th-232 in a reactor, but you need U-235 or Pu-239 to fuel these at first because you don’t yet have any U-233 to use.

This is why India has a three-stage program, using U/Pu in the first two stages and switching to Thorium (of which they have a great deal) only in the third stage. Whether the stage 3 reactors will be heavy-water reactors or molten salt has yet to be decided, but those are the main contenders they say.And if they knew how “efficient” these designs will be they would decide now which to use and stop wasting money on the other. There is much work still to do before we reach that stage.","3,665 followers",William Mook,783,9.3K,12.6M,https://www.quora.com/How-can-we-use-nuclear-fusion-as-an-energy-source
