0,"Is it possible to power electric buses by installing solar panels on them?Reverend LovejoyYou get maybe 1.5 kWh per day per square metre of panels, on a good day. Maybe next to nothing on a very dark, overcast day.I have no idea what size a bus is, but say the roof holds 15 m by 2 m of solar panels, that gives you 30 m2 or maybe 45 kWh per day. Or zero.45 kWh per day is useful, but probably not enough to run a bus all day. It represents roughly a half charge for a Tesla so roughly 150 km if only a bus used as little energyIs it possible to power electric buses by installing solar panels on them?Reverend LovejoyYou get maybe 1.5 kWh per day per square metre of panels, on a good day.

1,"It depends on the class of flare. Most flares are overhyped by many news accounts and are harmless. There is B class which very small. Under 10^-6 watts per sq meter at Earth. Virtually no Eatth effects. An order of magnidude more are C class flares, still not much to worry about. M class flares are next, and those cause limited radio blackouts but no power outages. The top scale flares are X class, these are the ones you hear more about. From 10^-4 to over 10^-3 watts per sq meter, these can cause issues. Astronauts on ISS need to take cover for these. The range is usaully X 1 to X 9, but X 2It depends on the class of flare. Most flares are overhyped by many news accounts and are harmless. There is B class which very small.

From 10^-4 to over 10^-3 watts per sq meter, these can cause issues. Astronauts on ISS need to take cover for these. The range is usaully X 1 to X 9, but X 20s and bigger have happened. The famous Carrington Event was likely X 40 to X 50 or more. Even then, the flare must be Earth facing to hit Earth to cause problems. In 2003 there was a flare estimated at over X 28 (estimated over X 28 because it went off scale and blinded the Solar detecting satellite sensor), but fortunately, it wasn't Earth facing and missed us. A flare that big, if it had hit could cause worse than world wide radio blackouts. Power outages, and damage to communication satellites would have been likely with an X 28. Fortunately, flares that strong are rare. The 1859 Carrington event is basically a 500 to 1000 year event. There are ice core samples of a solar storm about seven times more powerful than the Carrington Event, about 12,840 years ago. Even an equivalent Carrington event happening today, would knock out power over large country size areas both in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres which could take months to restore, not just days or weeks. The effects would also mushroom to limited or no running water, lack of fuel, no banking and big transportation issues from lack of being able to pump fuel. Electricity is important, and portable generators could NOT make up the shortfall. However, most Equatorial regions would not be as badly effected, and most would still have electricity. North America, Europe, Russia, China, most of Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Southern South America and areas in South America under the South Atlantic Anomoly, Plus Southern South Africa could all loose electricity for months, perhaps upto nearly a year depending on rebuilding large transformers and associated wiring. This scenario could happen with a repeat Carrington Event or stronger, but again, such flares are 1000 year events…","27,286 followers",Geoffrey Widdison,7.3K,12.7K,106.5M,https://www.quora.com/unanswered/Can-you-make-money-by-using-solar-panels-to-mine-Bitcoins-or-other-cryptocurrencies

4,"I just paid $12,000 to put 15 345 watt panels on my roof. I live on solar for the last 7 years in the desert. I love solar.People don’t see the benefit that I do. Government and utility companies put up barriers to solar that most people can’t get around. I was LIMITED to 15 panels when I could have afforded 30 because El Paso Electric won’t allow people to make money on the panels.I just paid $12,000 to put 15 345 watt panels on my roof.

6,"Solar-powered photovoltaic (PV) panels convert the sun's rays into electricity by exciting electrons in silicon cells using the photons of light from the sun. This electricity can then be used to supply renewable energy to your home or business. For example, we put electrical energy into a bulb and the bulb produces light (which is the desired form of output from a bulb), but we also get heat from the bulb (undesired form of energy from an electric bulb). Electrical energy conversion to light and heat.

7,"No. If they could, we would!The laws of thermodynamics:1. You can’t win.Okay, the real laws:1. Energy is conserved. To separate the magnets you supply energy, which then pulls the magnets back together. You can do this again and again, but it is you who are supplying the energy. And to do that you have to eat.
