Carbon Detonation Fusion permanently converts Carbon to energy and alternative elements (like non-radioactive Helium, Neon, and Oxygen gas) that do not produce any green house effect.Because during Carbon Detonation Fusion the temperature increases from the fusion, but volume is controlled by degenerate electrons and thus does not increase, plasma pressure and thus the rate of the fusion reaction can increase greatly - producing fusion's closest equivalent to fission's runaway chain reaction.By carefully controlling the amount of fusion fuel (carbon) used per shot, safe controlled bursts of fusion energy can be produced.The fusion carbon-burning process or carbon detonation fusion includes the following set of nuclear fusion reactions.The principal simple carbon burning fusion reactions are believed to be:6C12 + 6C-12 -> 10Ne-20 + 2He-4 + 4.617 MeV6C12 + 6C-12 -> 11Na-23 + 1H-1+ 2.241 MeV6C12 + 6C-12 -> 12Mg-23 + neutron – 2.599 MeV6C12 + 6C-12 -> 12Mg-24 + γ + 13.933 MeV6C12 + 6C-12 -> 8O-16 + 2He-4 + -0.113 MeVCarbon Detonation Fusion requires high temperatures (> 5×10^8 K or 50 keV) and high densities (> 3×10^9 kg/m3).It remains uncertain whether a Carbon Detonation Fusion will ever be used to produce controlled amounts of energy on earth.As plasma pressure increases, both the power that can be generated from a given fusion plasma and the rate of the fusion reaction in the plasma are greatly accelerated.LLNL researchers have recently demonstrated that they can achieve a pressure on a small solid sample of 5 terapascals (equivalent to 50 million atmospheres). This recent developments uses a shock-free dynamic (ramp) compression method driven by a large laser (NIF).Ramp compression of diamond to five terapascalsI believe that High Density ultra-compressed Plasmas produced in Inertial Confinement Fusion provide the best chance of producing Carbon Detonation Fusion on earth.--------------Are you interested in nuclear fusion?","220,151 followers",Franklin Veaux,823,47.3K,779.4M,https://www.quora.com/Can-a-fusion-reactor-be-designed-to-fuse-elements-heavier-than-hydrogen

It does not have a steam plant or turbines or generators.A successful ITER experiment (which seems likely but is not guaranteed) would lead to ITER's planned successor,DEMO, in turn leads to PROTO, the prototype nuclear fusion power plant.Although ITER (and it’s successors) certainly has the potential to be world-changing technology, it also has the potential to be a huge commercial failure. Unless the costs of producing electricity from a nuclear fusion power plant can be at least as low as the cost of electricity from existing nuclear fission power plants and probably more like lower than the cost of electricity from renewables, no one is going to build these things.","3,657 followers",Brent Oster,3.6K,357,1.8M,https://www.quora.com/Can-a-fusion-reactor-be-designed-to-fuse-elements-heavier-than-hydrogen

In fact you are more likely to die from a gun shot from the security guard at the plant than you are to die from the radiation.There is the other thing you need to know about nuclear radiation is that you either die from it immediately, or you’ll get cancer later on in life. The latter is what happened to John Wayne when he filmed theYes, this is actually true.John Wayne was a heavy smoker, but he didn’t die from smoking. He died of stomach cancer.Dr. Robert Pendleton, then a professor of biology at theHere are two reasons why nuclear energy is cleaner than coal. For one it doesn’t use coal. The other is energy output vs. fuel expenditure. You actually get more power out of nuclear reactors for less fuel. Whereas coal you need more fuel to get the power you need.That’s why nuclear reactors are cleaner. A small amount of fuel goes a long way when it comes to nuclear reactors. Meaning nuclear power is more efficient than coal. And the waste is easily stored. Also nuclear reactors produce less waste compared to coal fired plants. YUP! LESS WASTE. Coal waste is also toxic. It’s highly toxic. And you get more of that waste when you use fossil fuels.Nuclear power produces less waste. So, more efficient.And just to give you an idea of the power of uranium.You can’t get that from coal. Nuclear reactors literally pay for themselves.Next we’ll get to the generation of reactors we are currently using. It’s Generation 2 by the way. And here’s the problem. Gen 2 reactors should have been phased out long ago. Unfortunately a combination of eco-nuts such as yourself and the government is the reason why we’re still running them.Crazy environmentalists are keeping newer reactors from being built. All because of the scary waste, without realizing that newer generation reactors such as molten salt reactors, actually reuses the waste.You want to solve all of California’s energy problems? Stop being a bunch of whiny eco-freaks and remove the ban on nuclear power from that state. Build Gen 4 nuclear reactors, and no more blackouts. Your problems would be solved.The government is the other issue. You see the byproduct of Gen 2 reactors is plutonium. Which goes into our nuclear weapons arsenal.And there you go.Okay, people are saying I didn’t mention that fly ash is radioactive. Yes, it is. It’s nasty stuff. It also contains an enormous amount of heavy metals. What is uranium? A heavy metal. It is very nasty.How do I know how nasty fly ash is? This happened to my community in 2008.A nuclear reactor is not going to do that. That ash is filled with uranium, cadmium, cyanide, arsenic, lead. That is what is in the fly ash of a coal fired plant.You want to remind me about the nastiness of fly ash? The fallout that turned our sunsets red in December? Yes, keep reminding me how nasty fly ash is while I’m saying that nuclear power would be better. Many times better.Nuclear power doesn’t cause that mess.

5,"Nuclear power doesn’t release carcinogens or CO2 into the atmosphere as its used.Nuclear Power PlantNuclear power is similar to coal and natural gas in that it uses heat to create steam, which spins turbines that generates electricity. The major difference is that coal and natural gas must literally burn, which produces ash and smoke. The white stuff coming from the cooling tower in that image is simply steam, and that’s all. There’s no actual burning of the fuel rods used to create power.To make fuel rods, Uranium Ore is processed to make a fuel rod that’s below ‘critical mass’, which is theNuclear power doesn’t release carcinogens or CO2 into the atmosphere as its used.Nuclear Power PlantNuclear power is similar to coal and natural gas in that it uses heat to create steam, which spins turbines that generates electricity.

There’s no actual burning of the fuel rods used to create power.To make fuel rods, Uranium Ore is processed to make a fuel rod that’s below ‘critical mass’, which is the necessary mass to create a continuous nuclear reaction. When the rods are inserted into the reactor, there are neutron-blocking control rods that are used to regulate the reaction. When the reactor starts up, the control rods are retracted and the reaction begins. To stop the reaction, the rods are allowed to drop back into place.When the fuel rods have been spent, they are extracted from the reactor and placed into large pools of water to cool for a long time (they tend to get pretty toasty). These cooling pools are incredibly safe, as water inhibits the residual radiation given off by the rods. In fact, you could splash around the top of that pool and still be incredibly safe from the radioactive rods below.Spent Fuel Rod cooling poolThe problem afterwards becomes long-term storage. In the United States, we used to use Yucca Mountain, but there was a lot of protests stating that Yucca Mountain’s location wasn’t secure enough, meaning the spent fuel rods have been piling up. Places like Yucca Mountain are underground facilities built to accommodate thousands of tons of spent fuel rods for permanent storage. There are other facilities around the world whose purpose is identical: secure the waste in a place that can’t be accessed without a lot of deliberate work even after the facility is sealed and secured.Now, beyond the lack of emissions, you might wondering why we’d use such a material. The reason is because nuclear fuel has the highest energy density of any fuel source.Image source: XKCDYes, you’re looking at that right. Uranium has 76The reason we don’t use more nuclear power is because nuclear plants are ludicrously expensive.

I guess Jimmy sure showed Pakistan and North Korea!Why would you stop reprocessing before you got to high grade plutonium?Simple: it’s usable a fuel in nuclear reactors. That’s right! Nuclear: natures best renewable energy!What about the other radioactive materials?They are usable for the contrast dyes for contrast CT scans, contrast MRIs, treating thyroid cancer, and non-Hodgkins lymphoma, and other diseases.Wait… if that’s true, where do we get the stuff we use in medicine today?!?We buy it from Mexico and Russia! Those evil Russians, treating our strokes and other diseases!But wait… what if we siphoned off some of it, and made high grade plutonium anyway, wouldn’t that be bad?Well, it’s usable for RTGs — Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generators. What good are those for?Well, we used to use them for pacemakers, so we didn’t have to go back and replace the batteries every few years, like we have to do with pacemakers today.Where else is it used? Well, the Voyager spacecraft. The Viking rovers. The Mariner spacecraft. Deep sea probes. There are places you want to explore, where there is no way to use wind or solar.But we do those things today! Where do we get the plutonium for that!?!We buy it from Russia!They used to have a lot of lighthouses, powered by RTGs. They would last forever, and keep ships from running aground. And they would last…. well, practically forever.Russia is in the process of dismantling these light houses, one by one these days, and replacing them with electric versions.That seems like a bad idea; if they are doing that, they must have a good reason..What is it?To sell the plutonium to the U.S., silly. We prefer to put our nuclear weaste in 50 gallon drums, and store it in man-made cave under Yucca mountain. Instead of reprocessing it.And how much was would there be left, if we did reprocess it?Thimbles full.Which we could get rid of very easily, by building a couple of breeder reactors, creating more nuclear fuel in the process, and destroying what waste we had left by turning into other elements. That could be used for nuclear medicine and more reactor fuel.So why aren’t we using more nuclear energy, and reprocessing today! It sounds great!Wait… why is #2 bad?!?Don’t be silly! If it doesn’t produce greenhouse gasses, then you can’t buy carbon credits from them, so you can claim your business is “carbon neutral”, when it’s not!Unlike those huge natural gas generators California uses for >60% of it’s electricity, which belch CO2 all day long… plenty of carbon credits there!",454 followers,Graham Ross Leonard Cowan,12.5K,5.3K,2.2M,https://www.quora.com/How-can-nuclear-power-be-clean-if-its-waste-is-toxic

10,"To properly explain how temperature affects the operation of both power reactors and thermonuclear systems requires discussing a fair amount of physics.The principal effect that temperature has on the rate of fission (reactivity) is a phenomenon called “Doppler resonance broadening”.All commercial power reactors in the world right now are moderated thermal neutron systems. This means that the fast neutrons (~1 MeV) produced by fission are immediately slowed down by collisions with moderator atom nuclei until they have the same average kinetic energy as the temperature of the moderator (~300 C,To properly explain how temperature affects the operation of both power reactors and thermonuclear systems requires discussing a fair amount of physics.The principal effect that temperature has on the rate of fission (reactivity) is a phenomenon called “Doppler resonance broadening”.All commercial power reactors in the world right now are moderated thermal neutron systems. This means that the fast neutrons (~1 MeV) produced by fission are immediately slowed down by collisions with moderator atom nuclei until they have the same average kinetic energy as the temperature of the moderator (~300 C, ~570 K) which is about 0.05 eV (3000 m/sec).But, like the fuel and moderator atoms and molecules themselves, the thermal motion of the neutrons follows a Maxwellian energy distribution.The majority of the absorbing nuclei in the reactor core is U-238. The neutron capture cross section of U-228 at different energies looks like this:Those narrow spikes of absorption at specific energies are called resonances, and are due to quantum mechanical effects. Although the lowest energy spike starts rising around 5 eV, around 100 times higher in energy than the thermalized average, there is a small portion of the very long tail that is in this energy range, and there are also neutrons that encounter the thick forest of spikes in the fuel before they have been fully thermalized.Doppler resonance broadening is the effective increase in the width of those narrow spikes due to increasing temperature (and motion) of the uranium atoms in the fuel. This leads to increased parasitic absorption of neutrons with increasing fuel temperature, which reduces reactivity and makes the reactor stable — temperature increases from increased reactivity suppress that reactivity.There are other effects, expansion of moderator and fuel, reducing their effective density, and so forth, but the Doppler resonance absorption of U-238 is the dominant effect.For thermonuclear fusion the effective reaction rates are a combination of the fusion cross sections of the reactions at different energies, and the Maxwellian distribution of energies of the fuel nuclei. Together these factors produce these reaction rate curves:The fact that the curves actual start decreasing above a certain temperature (this can only be seen for D-T in this temperature range) is due to the two factors that affect the reaction cross sections: the quantum tunneling probability and the geometric cross section of the nuclei, it is the integrated product of these two that determine the rate.The quantum tunneling probability strictly increases with temperature. But the “size” of the nuclei is determined by the de Broglie wavelength of the nuclei (the “matter wavelength”) which decreases linearly with energy, so that the effective “area” of the nuclei decrease with the square of the energy. This effect eventually overwhelms the increasing tunneling probability.","220,151 followers",Franklin Veaux,3.1K,47.3K,779.4M,https://www.quora.com/Can-a-fusion-reactor-be-designed-to-fuse-elements-heavier-than-hydrogen
