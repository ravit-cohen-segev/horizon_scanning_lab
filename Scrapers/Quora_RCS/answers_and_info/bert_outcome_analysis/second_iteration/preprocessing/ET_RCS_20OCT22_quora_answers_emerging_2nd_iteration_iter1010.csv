Mechanical engineering department houses excellent research facilities like Space flight dynamics lab, Fluid-structure interaction laboratory, McGill institute for Aerospace engineering. The super computing facilities in the McGill CFD lab are second to none in Canada. However, most of the mechanical engineering students often complaint about challenging courses and research. So you need to bear this in mind before coming here.Apart from studies, i also believe that McGill students have a better social life than students at Waterloo, mostly because McGill is in downtown Montreal whereas Waterloo is almost a 100 kms away from Toronto.Overall, I think that the Department of Mechanical engineering at U of T is the only department in Canada that could be compared to McGill's.",UNKNOWN,Aj.

2,"To put it simply, quantum computers can process in parallelism whereas conventional machines can only compute digital bit data one at a time.Qubits are able to exist in superposition which have the ability to be millions of times more powerful than any machine we have today.Unfortunately, the production mechanics and capabilities for quantum computers are still too specialized (as opposed to commercialized) which limits quantum computing and its applications to just educational, defense, and specialized facilities.On the other hand, chip manufacturers such as TSMC are still going infinitely smTo put it simply, quantum computers can process in parallelism whereas conventional machines can only compute digital bit data one at a time.Qubits are able to exist in superposition which have the ability to be millions of times more powerful than any machine we have today.Unfortunately, the production mechanics and capabilities for quantum computers are still too specialized (as opposed to commercialized) which limits quantum computing and its applications to just educational, defense, and specialized facilities.On the other hand, chip manufacturers such as TSMC are still going infinitely smaller with their 2nm production technique, squeezing an increasing number of transistors within the same amount of space.So the answer is, yes, quantum computers are lightyears ahead and faster in technology as compared to conventional supercomputers. However, its use case and widespread adoption will take a considerable amount of time due to the cost of production, implementation, and the growth of the ecosystem as a whole.But to be honest, for most consumers, what we have today is already adequate in an objective sense - the multitasking ability of our computers today provides a seamless experience for us as it is. Quantum computing would probably take intensive processing tasks such as video editing for 8K 16K footage in future, or complex computing to the next level.Thanks and hope this answers your question!","18,417 followers",Nathan Stanish,1.9K,2.3K,62.2M,https://www.quora.com/Which-is-more-powerful-a-supercomputer-or-a-quantum-computer

Quantum computing could also be used to crack most commonly used forms of digital encryption. It may one day also be used to streamline logistics and delivery operations, as well as speeding up machine learning applications. But ""quantum supremacy"" does not mean quantum computers have yet arrived in the sense that they will soon replace the conventional computers that power our lives.Quantum supremacy means only that researchers have been able to use a quantum computer to perform a single calculation that no conventional computer, even the biggest supercomputer, can perform in a reasonable amount of time. This calculation involved checking whether the output of an algorithm for generating random numbers was truly random.The researchers were able to use a quantum computer to perform this complex mathematical calculation in three minutes and 20 seconds, according to the paper. They say it would have taken Summit 3—an IBM-built machine that is the world's most powerful commercially-available conventional computer—about 10,000 years to perform the same task.","9,922 followers",Brett Bergan,1.3K,7K,82.9M,https://www.quora.com/Which-is-more-powerful-a-supercomputer-or-a-quantum-computer

The detail in a world is also not just black and white, but often things like “how hot is the temperature of each parcel of air, water”. The numbers being expressed often fall within a very wide range, from very small (i.e. 0.000000001 to very large, i.e. trillions). A floating point format lets us represent these numbers with reasonable precision for the calculations. These numbers can be organised into matrices, then computations, often vector computations, made between these matrices. Since the number of these computations required is so vast, it is worth asking how fast a computer can chug through this, thus the floating point operations per second (FLOPs) is a key metric.There are certainly other computations that can be done that are not made using floating point data, such as with strings of text, or other data that can be digitised as integers within a reasonable range (i.e. 32-bit integer, between 0 and 4 billion). For example, if you built a super-computer to search for all the instant messages ever written in the world in real time, all of which are text data, it would want to have a high performance in such integer operations. It just happens that more super-computers are involved in those types of computation where floating point. Plus, as another has answered, floating point operations are inherently harder to do fast. So it’s good to brag when you can do it fast.","4,393 followers",Pat Roberts,5.5K,3.9K,14.1M,https://www.quora.com/Which-is-more-powerful-a-supercomputer-or-a-quantum-computer

Indians and Indians who worked for British govt, worked in collaboration to cheat the government. This continued after the independence and we are still cheating our government. Our leaders failed to develop ethics among people towards the nation.Mistake 3:After partition, India decided to go secular way and allowed minorities to stay. At that time riots were happening. When they had decided majority and minority should be living together, they should have also made efforts to develop unity. However, they did something opposite. Instead of making one law for all, they made different laws for the minority. As a result, the difference grew over time.Mistake 4:British government was strict on Indians. Suddenly after independence, there were Indian faces in the government. Hence there was no fear of law. Till today, we can see many people don't have healthy fear and respect towards law.I feel these are the 4 basic things that decide the future of a nation. I think India is still a developing country for these 4 reasons.Please note that OP has asked where did we go wrong. So I have pointed only mistakes.

India had been looted, subject to a rule of violence, racism and economic exploitation rarely seen in history. It would be reduced from the world’s largest economy, largest exporter of manufactured goods and agricultural foodstuffs to a nation unable to feed itself and divided. In 1947, India was a nation at war, with millions of refugees coming in both the Western and Eastern sectors of the nation. There were three weeks of foreign currency reserves and Churchill's policy led Bengal Famine had not just technically ended. Soon India would run out of essential medicines, and they were no national resources, or currency to pay for them with. India’s ability to even make basic medicine had been all but destroyed in the 190 years of colonialism. Refined gasoline would go into shortage as the war effort in Kashmir continued. Major industries ceased to function as supply lines from East Bengal and West Punjab stopped. Yet, in this epic disaster Indian National Railways never stopped running, nor the will of India’s people to survive. Rich and poor, refugee and local all worked as one at this time for everyone knew this was the first time the dawn of freedom had come to rise, after 190 years of slavery,loss of Indian dignity, pride and hope for the masses of India.Bengal Famine 1943.1947 Partition of IndiaPrime Minister Nehru, would stand at his most difficult hour at this time. He would at his advanced age after doing nearly 9 years in colonial prison the longest just ending in the years before partition, he would visit refugees, encourage them, and it would become clear he had no resources to back his words other than his intentions. Mahatma Gandhi would be lost in 1948, and India would largely be held together because of the dynamic and tireless work Sardar Patel, who with a heart condition managed to unite India against all odds. Prime Minister Nehru never listened to Sardar Patel enough in his lifetime, I have heard this so many times in my life from people who knew him. As the 1950s dawned India embarked on a massive campaign of building heavy industry, Schools, Universities and Hospitals. Yet, India could not produce enough food to feed it’s population. It was predicted that India would collapse in the 1970s because of a population which would grow to over 600 million by then. Malnutrition affected the population, and basic health requirements could not be met. India would ask for food assistance and be denied it by both the U.S. and the U.K. in 1951. Famine was only averted that year, because of emergency food assistance by the U.S.S.R. on orders from Stalin.Nehru would approach the issue of agriculture by ending Zamindari (Large Land Holdings) in the 1950s. Soon there were small independent farmers who were landowners. Mechanization though being introduced was not affordable for farmers. Crop yields would remain low, and the skill set of farmers would not greatly increase. As time went on the constant need to import grain, would steadily eat at Indian growth rates as capital was used to import food. By the 1960s though food production had increased, it still was not sufficient to end grain imports. A new Prime Minister Smt. Indira Gandhi would be forced to devalue to Rupee in order to get food assistance from the U.S. In personal recollections she would reveal how demeaning the experiences were as India was lectured on what policies to embrace in order to get food assistance.India’s strategic food reserve is one the largest in the world.India’s victory in the 1971 Indo-Pakistan War would prelude a decade of success for India that it had not seen in a millennium. In 1974, India would detonate an atomic device successfully, and in the late 1970s, India would become a food sufficient nation. By the early 1980s, India had the ability to export food products for the first time since 1757. The age of India having a “Begging Bowl” in her hands was over. In her epic landslide election in 1980 Prime Smt. Indira Gandhi would campaign in an India which was an Atomic Power, a food exporter and manufacturer of industrial products. India was a nation which had the world’s 4th most powerful military. All this had happened in 33 years from the end of colonialism. Since 1947, India never again has had a famine, since the early 2000s it maintains one of the world’s largest food reserves in the world. For the 66 Million Indians who perished in colonial famines all this happened far too late, yet may this give some dignity to their plight, suffering and memory, that they are not forgotten.",UNKNOWN,Aheli Bal,1.5K,600,13.9M,https://www.quora.com/Which-is-more-powerful-a-supercomputer-or-a-quantum-computer
