In order to do so, we need to maintain the fusion materials under intense temperatures and pressures. If we were to try to do that using nuclear fission, we would need to produce and contain a sustained fission explosion which, I believe, would be problematic. Current fission reactors use highly controlled reactions which release heat at a slow rate, but I do not believe that process would be helpful in providing the conditions necessary for fusion.","220,149 followers",Franklin Veaux,3.1K,47.3K,779.4M,https://www.quora.com/Why-dont-we-use-nuclear-fission-to-boost-nuclear-fusion
2,"Typical nuclear fission reactors work at about 300 centigrade temperatures.To start a fusion reaction, tens of thousands of centigrades are needed.The only way to start a fusion reaction with a fission reaction is making an uncontrolled chain reaction - fission bomb.And, starting a fusion reaction is really not the problem with fusion power. Even a 13-years old school kid managed to do it in his parents garage.The problem of fusion power is that controlling and containing the fusion reaction needs more energy than what it gives, unless the reactor is very, very big and expensive.

3,"Because the amount of fuel locked up in a fusion reactor is one or two second’s worth of energy generation. So in the most catastrophic imaginable accident, the energy and volume of reaction products released into the environment is small enough that it will only affect the reactor site. Whereas a fission reactor has about ten years worth of fuel in it, gradually growing more and more toxic over time. So the amount that can be released in a most catastrophic imaginable accident is huge.Secondly, the products of fusion are few and safe.

So the amount that can be released in a most catastrophic imaginable accident is huge.Secondly, the products of fusion are few and safe. There will be some radioactive waste generated by irradiation of the reactor structure, but this is not a huge volume and relatively easy to handle. Fission, by contrast, generates a vast cocktail of products with a hugely varied chemical and radiological spectrum, requiring a range of cleanup and defence mechanisms.While fusion is not totally clean and safe, it is orders of magnitude below fission in worst-case consequences.","220,149 followers",Franklin Veaux,3.2K,47.3K,779.4M,https://www.quora.com/Why-dont-we-use-nuclear-fission-to-boost-nuclear-fusion

5,"Q.A. I assume you mean for producing electricity.I read a great quote from Andy Grove, warlord of Intel many decades ago, “gallium arsenide is the substrata of the future, and it always will be.”It appears nuclear fusion for power production is just like that.","220,149 followers",Franklin Veaux,3.2K,47.3K,779.4M,https://www.quora.com/Why-dont-we-use-nuclear-fission-to-boost-nuclear-fusion
6,"By “feasible” I’m going to guess you mean capable of commercial electricity generation. We’ve already discovered everything we need to know about the fusion part of the process and have been doing fusion for decades. There are a number of engineering challenges to do with the confinement of very hot plasmas, the generation of strong magnetic fields, the extraction of fusion byproducts, the embrittlement of “first wall” materials by neutron bombardment, the dissipation of heat loads running to tens of megawatts per square metre, and more.

(Not all challenges apply to all fusion concepts as there are many different approaches). But actually, solutions to practically all of the issues are either known or well advanced.Really, the single remaining challenge is the behaviour of the plasma under very extreme conditions. Plasmas carry their own electric currents and magnetic fields which interact with those of the containment. High temperatures introduce chaotic instabilities that cause the plasma to twist like a demon. The trick is to make the plasma behave stably for long enough to do useful amounts of fusion. The plasma behaviour is very difficult to observe as the instabilities grow from microscopic scales, and very difficult to simulate with computer models. Neverthless, great strides have been made with numerical simulations.The trouble is, it’s very hard to predict when anyone will crack this final nut. Looking at nuclear fusion from the outside it can seem as if they’ve just been plugging away at the same problem for decades. But this really isn’t the case. Enormous strides are being made each year. Quite a number of commercial fusion startups claim to be within just two to five years of demonstrating breakeven fusion and then scaling up to commercial sizes. (Fusion rates tend to scale exponentially with machine size). Commercial fusion that actually puts electricity on the grid is definitely not earlier than 2030–2040 but we might be able to say that we are on a definite path to success well before that. (Or … things might never work out after all).",825 followers,George Dowson,4K,527,3.7M,https://www.quora.com/Why-dont-we-use-nuclear-fission-to-boost-nuclear-fusion

9,We already have.We have just recently (2022) succeeded in controlling a fusion reaction from which we gained more energy than we put into it.The next step is to scale it up to practical use. This is going to involve a very big and very expensive machine. At least for the first few. Then we will have to work on scaling the machine itself down.Unfortunately I do not see fusion reactors ever being built within the United States.

10,"It’s not uncontrollable, but it’s not sustainably controllable. With fission reactors we have multiple methods to control the fission reactions and make it self-sustainable. But fusion reactors or devices are not yet able to be self-sustainable, i.e. producing enough energy to keep the fusion reaction going on.If by controlling the fusion reactor you mean stopping the fusion reaction, it’s easier than fission. Fusion reactions require high level vacuum environment, and to stop the fusion reactor we can simply stop the fuel supply and pump inert gas into the reaction chamber, such as Helium-4.It’s not uncontrollable, but it’s not sustainably controllable.

11,"The rate of nuclear fusion inside a tokamak experiment like ITER can be adjusted by carefully adjusting fusion conditions inside the tokamak fusion device as it operates (temperature, confinement time, and plasma pressure).The above graph displays reactivity as a function of plasma temperature for several important fusion fuels.

While temperature is important, it must be simultaneously achieved together with adequate confinement time and plasma density or little actual fusion occurs.The parameter hardest to achieve in tokamak and stellarator devices we know how to build is actually not plasma temperature but rather plasma density.The graphic below shows that current fusion experiments vary in the density of their fusion plasmas by in excess of ten orders of magnitude - with ICF fusion using the densest plasmas and tokamaks and stellarators using the least dense plasmas.It is advantageous to confine fusion plasma under high pressure, but it is possible to achieve fusion in low ion density plasma also. Fusion experiments on earth employ widely differing plasma densities. There is literally a 10^10 difference in the typical operating plasma density inside a magnetic confinement fusion tokamak experiment (ITER) and a inertial confinement fusion experiment (NIF).Practical production of energy from fusion will require producing net energy while simultaneously achieving a high enough power density to make fusion power plants commercially competitive with alternative fission and fossil fuel power plants. The power that can be drawn from a plasma at fusion conditions is proportional to the square of the density of the fusion plasma. The denser the plasma, the more energy that can be extracted from it.It is easier to produce fusion reactors that exhibit high energy density if they employ dense plasma at fusion conditions.Fusion experiments vary greatly in the density of their fusion plasmas. There is over 10^10 (ten orders of magnitude) difference between current tokamak - stellerator plasma density and ICF laser or particle beam fusion plasma density.Can we achieve high Power density (referring to the rate of energy production per unit of reactor volume) from magnetic confinement devices like thye ITER tokamak or a Weldenstein stellarator?Tokamak and Stellarator Fusion will almost certainly have a lower power density than fission and therefore will require a larger plant to produce the same energy output.It is perhaps not unreasonable to suppose a fusion plant based on magnetic confinement ITER/DEMO technology might have to be ten times as big and therefore something close to ten times as costly — as a present-day fission nuclear plant to produce the same amount of power.Given the already intolerable costs of building fission plants, it would seem that machines that use very low density plasma like tokamaks and stellerators do not stand much of a chance to achieve high energy density and that would make them economically viable as a commercial technology and a secure technical basis for future commercial fusion power plants.Before scientists can effectively capture and deploy fusion energy, they must learn to predict major disruptions that can halt fusion reactions and damage the walls of doughnut-shaped tokamak fusion devices. Timely prediction of disruptions, the sudden loss of control of the hot, charged plasma that fuels the reactions, will be vital to triggering steps to avoid or mitigate such large-scale events. Fusion researchers at ITER and JET tokamaks currently attempt to use high speed real time computing to predict plasma disruptions that might be dangerous and halt power generation. A combination of plasma related high speed sensor data aquisition coupled to a predictive artificial intelligence code running on a local computer is major area of technical development that it is hoped will improve the chance that tokamaks can be adjusted to run stably for extended periods of time.The issue of producing net energy while simultaneously achieving a high enough power plant power density are a dominant theme for the near future selection of which fusion technology is best suited to produce competitive fusion power plants.Technical note1:Technical note2:controlled and uncontrolled –but is this really true?Is there in reality two types of fusion?It is said that in uncontrolled nuclear fusion, vastamount of energy in uncontrolled manner isreleased causing destruction only—the hydrogenbomb is an example. Thus uncontrolled nuclearfusion is not viewed as something of use for constructive purpose.It is perceived that in controlled nuclear fusion, the vast energy of fusion reactions is released steadily so it can be used for peaceful purposes, say, for nuclear fusion reactors.But is there really a differenceor is it just a perception?Is it perhaps true that there is really only one type of fusion and depending on the technology and the amount of fuel you use, you get a more or less rapid release of fusion energy.While the smoothness and the time of release of energy from fusion may be different, the fusion reactions (Deuterium Tritium or Deuterium-Deuterium) are all the same and the waste products produced (helium and neutrons) are all the same.","220,149 followers",Franklin Veaux,1.6K,47.3K,779.4M,https://www.quora.com/Why-dont-we-use-nuclear-fission-to-boost-nuclear-fusion
