1,"Will controlled fusion electricity generation make solar electricity generation for the power grid obsolete?I don’t think so.In fact, I think it is very likely that the reverse will happen - cheap solar electricity (plus cheap storage) will make building large-scale fusion power plants uneconomic.Here’s my reasoning:ITERWill controlled fusion electricity generation make solar electricity generation for the power grid obsolete?I don’t think so.In fact, I think it is very likely that the reverse will happen - cheap solar electricity (plus cheap storage) will make building large-scale fusion power plants uneconomic.Here’s my reasoning:ITERBack to ITER. ITER is a very large, very expensive laboratory experiment, not a prototype power reactor. It is expected to be completed around 2025. Then 10 years of plasma experiments before it attempts fusion around 2035. Already you can see why ITER will have no significant impact on the current roll-out of wind and solar projects.If ITER is successful in producing aDEMO will be (at this stage) 15% larger than ITER and is expected maybe 2048 (the expected dates seem to be slipping backwards at about the rate of one year per year).DEMO is still not a commercial nuclear fusion power plant. For that, we wait until the next step, sometimes referred to asDoes anyone think that investors in a renewables project planned for 2019 should be worried about the possibility of a nuclear fusion reactor undercutting them some time after 2050? I wouldn’t be.However, even if nuclear fusion power is not an answer in the short term or even medium term, could it be a solution some time after 2050? Personally, I doubt it.This is theNote this plant is complete with turbine hall and electrical generators.Look at a photo of ITER.(Photo By Oak Ridge National Laboratory - ITER Site, CC BY 2.0)ITER is smaller than a working commercial nuclear fusion power plant and does not have any turbines of generators. Can you see how a power plant based on this style of design, but larger and with much more equipment can be built for less cost that an existing nuclear fission power plant? I’m sceptical.And how much will the (relative) price of renewables have dropped between now and 2050? Solar panels and wind turbines have been getting cheaper, so have batteries.For these reasons, I suspect nuclear fusion power plants will be a dud. They will arrive too late and be too expensive.However, I’d love to be proved wrong.","3,397 followers",Raymond Scottman,1.1K,0,0,https://www.quora.com/unanswered/Can-you-make-money-with-solar-power-and-cryptocurrency-mining

There is a project which has got a masternode very easy to set up and pays back pretty good.

11,"What would happen if a solar flare discontinued electricity?It can’t, it won’t. Solar flares only effect very long grid wires. They do so by inducing a very low frequency DC like current in the long wires. If this DC current is allowed to reach transformers it can bias the magnetic field and cause the peak of the AC 60/50Hz power to over saturate the core. That means the normally safe AC currents are exceed the dynamic range of the magnetic fields. The power instead heats the wires causing the transformer to fail.We will get at about a day of warning.

The long lines can be shut off and grounded for the expected duration of the flare, usually a few hours at most.Many long grid lines already have switches that sense the DC currents and disconnect automatically.Countries that do infrastructure right have installed capacitors in series that totally block the DC currents while still delivering the AC power.

12,"There is a folktale of an Indian Maharajah who saw a football match for the first time. He was quite aghast at the end and told his secretary - ""buy each of those players one of those balls.

He was quite aghast at the end and told his secretary - ""buy each of those players one of those balls. I don't like the idea of all of them fighting for something as simple as that""This ""one world"" idea is not far from that.Humans by nature compete. And we compete at multiple levels. This competition produces most of the innovations we see around us. For instance, in the 1950s Americans were slacking in their space research. In came the Russians with their Sputnik. The national rivalries were sparked and in the following two decades world saw an amazing range of innovations in space science. Had the Russians never tried to compete with the Americans, we would not have had satellites or moon landing.Computers were mainly invented to break enemy codes in WWII and Internet was built during the cold war as a way to keep communication running in case the Russians managed to attack a few key points.If I'm able to type something that you could read somewhere else in the world, it is because of the national rivalries between US and other countries.It is all about incentives.Yesterday, I was listening to a lecture from a popular historian on why India, China and Arabs didn't discover the new trade routes at their heights in the middle ages. One of the key reasoning was the profit motive. These cultures didn't desire for much from the west. In fact, when Vasco da Gama visited Calicut for the first time, the locals laughed at what he had to offer. Thus, the Portuguese had to just give up their silver having no other useful stuff. This trade imbalance continued for centuries.On the other hand, Portuguese, Dutch and later other Europeans had plenty to gain - silk, spices and later coffee, tea, cotton etc. Thus, they had the motive. This resulted in their exploration around the world. If the Europeans were not in so much pain to compete, they would not have discovered the new world and other parts of the world.Money and pride are two of the biggest motivators for humans. This keeps our engine running.Monopolies and InnovationTwelve years ago, Microsoft had very little competition in the browser space. Internet Explorer was at some point clueless of what should be done. Innovation sagged in the absence of competition. Then Firefox came with a variety of new innovation such as a practical implementation of the tabbed interface. IE6 was then started to get dusted up. Later Chrome joined the party. Innovation in browsers rapidly expanded.Ultimately it was the competition. Same in the case of politics. When there is rivalry, nations innovate. Money and pride motivate the commoners to pay attention to their scientists and then fund them with resources to push the frontiers. Without that push from government, science will sag and so will every other part of the society.In short, competition in governance and politics is very crucial just as a riveting football game enriches our fun time. Of course, hooliganism is bad and so are wars. Thus, we have to constantly work towards ways to keep the rowdy crowd under control and root out violence. But, hooliganism doesn't mean you need to avoid playing. In the same way wars don't mean we have to stop national rivalries and pride.Who benefits from this one world?You can see this ""one world"" government idea from Indians and possibly from some Chinese and Americans. It is not a surprise. Because, groups with huge demographic advantage would dominate this ""one world"" while smaller cultures will be waylaid. Imagine Israel. Is there any possibility of them merging with this one world and give up all the things they fought for? One world will be the trampling of small cultural groups.What if Idi Amin is the world leader?Finally, when people think of ""one world"" they have some utopian visions. Doves flying, smiling child faces. What if the one world leader is Idi Amin? When he was ruling Uganda his people at least had the option of moving to other countries. What if there is no other country to go to? How will you escape tyranny?Do you think it is impossible to elect a tyrant as the world leader? Think again. There are far more crazy people in the world than scholars and peace activists. In ""one world"" these people would have enormous power from the scale. You can already see some semblance of this in the elections in big countries. The moderates get weeded out in large countries as they cannot match the organizational power of the strong. When you expand their reach to the whole world, the good politicians don't stand a chance.Leave alone tyranny. How about fundamental differences in culture? Islam will be the largest religion of this ""one world"".  It is possible for a democratically elected world government to propose Sharia law. Will it be acceptable to others? If it is not accepted, how will you fight this ""one world"" government.A single world government monopolizing will be terrible for innovation in social, cultural and technological terms.","105,624 followers",Dave Consiglio,566,6.8K,91.4M,https://www.quora.com/If-the-entire-world-accepts-cryptocurrency-as-the-only-form-of-payments-and-a-solar-flare-destroys-all-electronics-of-world-what-will-happen
