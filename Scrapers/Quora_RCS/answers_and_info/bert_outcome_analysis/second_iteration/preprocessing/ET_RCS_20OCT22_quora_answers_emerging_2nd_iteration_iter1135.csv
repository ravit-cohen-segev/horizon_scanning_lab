Or at least they can know which floor were you in, before collapse.If your house is big, you can add open/close sensors(or counters) to doors of toilets/garage or other rooms, to know if they are available, on screen(as red/green indicators).You can attach some micro pressure change detectors on corridors so that you can know someone is approaching to your room while you are secretly pc gaming.Stick some cheap measurement units per food object in refrigerator, so that you don’t need to check if they are cold enough without decreasing lifespan of refrigerator. (could be some drinks or icecream whatsoever)Temperature measurement per room, to increase efficiency of heating. Some rooms need less heat, some rooms more, depending on heat exchange between them, also could be dynamically tuned when you pass between rooms but this would need more advanced radiators.When you have hundreds of socks to pair with each other, sensors with unique id values can help you find them quickly, they just need some sort of interface on your computer and a real world sorting mechanism(it could be a “pick and compare” thing) that sorts them on their id values.","3,743 followers",Evan DeFilippis,6K,0,0,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-of-the-most-useful-IoT-Internet-of-Things-devices-for-use-at-home

Many consumers buying these smart devices currently don't bother to hook them up to their WiFi, which means they're essentially offline and out of reach of hackers. But that may change as manufacturers continue to tout the benefits of connectivity. And the number of devices is expected to more than triple, to 75 billion, by 2025.The sheer number of vulnerable devices gives hackers powerful leverage. The Mirai attack of 2016, which may have been inspired by Cui's original paper, illustrates how dangerous the threat has grown. Paras Jha, a quiet, socially awkward college dropout from New Jersey, ran a lucrative business renting space on his own private computer server to fellow aficionados of the video-game Minecraft, so they could play privately with their friends. It sounds pleasant, but the business is cutthroat. A common tactic of Jha and his rivals was to hack into the home computers of unsuspecting people, hijack them with malware and instruct them to send torrents of unwanted messages and data to the machines of their rivals, overwhelming them and hopefully shutting them down—known as a Distributed Denial of Service Attack (DDoS). Unsuspecting customers, frustrated by the ""unreliable"" service, were then easy targets for poaching.In 2016, Jha and two Minecraft friends he'd met online decided to do his rivals one better. They hacked not only desktop computers but also the myriad security cameras, wireless routers, digital video recorders, household appliances, and other IoT devices. Like Cui before him, Jha and his friends wrote a program that scanned the internet to locate vulnerable devices. But unlike Cui, they actually planted malware on the machine and took control of them. Leveraged by the proliferation of smart devices, Jha's zombie bot army grew faster than he could have imagined--by the end of the first day, he had appropriated 65,000 devices; by some estimates, his zombie army reached 600,000.The attack, nicknamed ""Mirai"" (""the future"") after a Japanese television series, was so powerful that Jha wasn't content with taking down his small-fry Minecraft rivals. He also trained the new weapon on the huge French telecom provider OVH, which hosted a popular tool that his rivals relied on to defend themselves against his attacks. Eventually, the cops took notice. Jha was fined $8.6 million and 2,500 hours of community service working for the FBI.Many of the largest tech companies have invested heavily in tapping into the market for ""smart home"" devices, one of the fastest-growing areas for IoT devices. Amazon is among those dominating the market for smart hubs, along with Google, which purchased the digital thermostat maker Nest in 2014 for $3.2 billion. Google has since expanded it to become a digital hub that also includes smoke detectors and security systems like smart doorbells and locks. Samsung has the SmartThings hub, which it acquired in 2014 for $200 million, and now connects to air conditioners, washers, and TVs. Apple has a home kit that can control any number of devices through voice commands delivered in a range of its HomePod.(Dave Limp, of Amazon devices and services, introduces the Echo Dot in 2018. GRANT HINDSLEY/AFP/GETTY)Gaping vulnerabilitiesOnce these systems are installed, devices from a growing number of companies can be added to the home network, including those made by well-known home appliance manufacturers like GE, Bosch, and Honeywell. Belkin makes a line of connected appliances that includes a Crock-Pot WeMo Smart Slow Cooker, smart Mr. Coffee maker and a smart home humidifier. There's a lot of money to be made. All told by the end of 2019, more than $490 billion in profits will have been earned on the nearly 2 billion consumer devices sold over the previous 12 months, according to the property management consulting firm iProperty Management.To try to draw attention to the dangers—and the things consumers should be asking questions about when buying new IoT products—Antonakakis and Alrawi, in collaboration with researchers at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, have developed a rating system and begun evaluating the security of a wide array of IoT devices. And surprisingly they found gaping vulnerabilities in devices and systems produced by even some of the most tech-savvy companies.The vulnerability of IoT devices goes well beyond holes in password protection, the vulnerability exposed by the Mirai attack, they argue. IoT devices can also be accessed and taken over directly through the home network they are connected to, and that home network is only as strong as its weakest link. That means that even if each device comes with a unique password and username, it's not necessarily secure. Once hackers find a way onto the home network through one vulnerable device, the path is often wide open to the rest of the network.To secure an IoT device, they argue, manufacturers need to patch vulnerabilities in four different areas : direct access to the device itself, the mobile app used to run it, the way it communicates with its home network and, in many cases, the cloud-based server that manufacturers use to push out updates, collect user data, or provide new services.Getting all that right is not easy. For a vendor to secure all four parts, Alrawi notes, it needs a good mobile-app developing team ""that knows secure development,"" a ""system team that does very good embedded system development and secure development"" and cloud experts who can design a secure cloud ""backend"" that allows the device to be managed without exposing it to additional risk. Finally, the device manufacturers need somebody who has network knowledge on how to build efficient and secure internet protocols and what protocols to avoid.""They have to balance all this with usability,"" he says ""So you can see that this is already getting really hard to manage just mentally. When a startup team that comes up with this great idea wants to push a product to market, they're usually a small team that doesn't have all this expertise. But even with big vendors, some of these problems are really hard to pin down and manage.""Indeed, while Antonakakis, Alrawi and their team give relatively high marks for device security to the mainstream products like the Amazon Echo and the Belkin Netcam, they gave them Cs, Ds, and Fs for network security—a measure of how protected these devices are from intruders who manage to access the home wireless network through other vulnerable devices. And while a number of devices associated with Google's Nest smart home products (like thermostats, smoke detectors, smart locks, and doorbells) receive As and Bs for device and network security, they got Cs and Ds for mobile and cloud protections—meaning a resourceful hacker intent on say, unlocking the front door, could still access a home.The cloud category is the most worrisome. Since many of these services are cloud-based and connected to central company servers, if a determined, well-financed hacker—say, China, North Korea or Russia—was to use the same kind of sophisticated exploits they have used to bypass security on the traditional internet of computers, there's no telling what they might do.""You're talking about getting access to potentially millions of people's homes, and when that happens, think about all of the microphones and cameras and actuators that you have around your house, and multiply that out by all the people who use these things,"" Cui says.""Many consumers don't fully understand the risks associated with installing some of these devices in their homes,"" adds Alrawi.Until they do, the situation is unlikely to change. Many experts wonder how big a price we will have to pay before that happens. ""It's a mess,"" says David Kennedy, a cybersecurity expert who designs security for a wide array of manufacturers and has testified before Congress on the IoT. ""An absolute mess. We're going into this very blind, without a lot of security discussions around what the impacts are going to be to our lives and to our safety.""Kennedy, whose current title is CEO of the company TrustedSec, has hacked into his share of devices over the years to make a point, including smart TVs, thermostats, smart fridges, robotic house cleaners and controllers that are connected to the energy grid. But Kennedy's biggest concern at the moment is in the area of automotive safety.There have already been some cautionary tales. In 2015, Fiat Chrysler had to issue a safety recall affecting 1.4 million vehicles in the United States so it could patch software vulnerabilities, after two security researchers hacked into the internet-connected entertainment system of a Jeep Cherokee carrying a magazine reporter, took control of the vehicle, blasted the radio and AC, then brought traffic to a standstill in the middle of a freeway.The problem, says Kennedy, is that most cars have scores of different pieces of technology in them, many of which are connected directly to the internet to allow them to transmit data needed for preventive maintenance. But the manufacture of these different IoT devices is often subcontracted out to scores of different contractors, which makes it logistically difficult to provide security updates and patches when new security vulnerabilities are discovered. (He pointed to Tesla as the major exception because, he argues, it is ""a software manufacturer first and car manufacturer second,"" and thus knows how to build secure systems.)The idea of regularly pushing out preventive security updates to patch newly discovered vulnerabilities in IoT-networked cars—a standard practice for products like Microsoft Windows and the Apple iPhone—is new and has not yet been incorporated into the automotive industry. ""I can't talk about which car manufacturers I've done assessment work for, but I can tell you that I've worked for a number of them, and security practices need a lot of work,"" he says. ""They're not pushing patches out to the cars, which makes them extremely vulnerable to specific attacks—everything from eavesdropping in your car to driving them off the road.""Online Break-ins Hackers could break into one device on a car or in a home and from there gain access to an entire network. Many toys are now linked to the internet. (ROBYN BECK/AFP/GETTY)The nightmare scenario is a mass fleet takeover, where a bad actor hacks different cars across the world to cause mass mayhem. ""That's definitely something that's possible now with these interconnected cars, no question about it,"" Kennedy says. ""Someone will lose their life and then eventually they'll kind of knee jerk into fixing the whole industry. I think that's what it will take to change the mentality of car manufacturers.""Lawmakers in some jurisdictions are beginning to wade into the murky waters of IoT regulation. In January, California will become the first state to implement an IoT security law. The bill, passed in 2018 with a January 2020 deadline, will require companies that make connected devices to equip them with ""reasonable security features,"" explicitly requiring that each device come with either a unique passcode or require the user to generate one before using the IoT device for the first time—taking aim at patching the vulnerability exploited so successfully in the Mirai exploit and the copycat attacks that have followed. Beyond that, however, the law seems to have been written to be purposely vague, allowing room for further state guidance in the future.Cybersecurity experts have called on the Federal government in the U.S. to step in to regulate the industry. The U.S. House of Representatives last March introduced a bill, for the third session in a row, that would require the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in the U.S. Department of Commerce to develop recommended standards for IoT devices, and would assign the Office of Management and Budget (OMB ) the task of issuing guidance to agencies that aligns with NIST's requirements. The law would also require NIST to offer guidance on vulnerability disclosure and report on IoT cybersecurity threats.Two and half years ago, NIST started a program to look at the issue and this past summer solicited public comment on a voluntary set of minimum ""baseline"" security functions that any internet-capable device should offer, whether it is intended for consumers, businesses or federal agencies, says Katerina ""Kat"" Megas NIST program manager, Cybersecurity for Internet of Things.Among them, every single device must have a unique number or identifier associated with it that shows up on the network, which would make it easy to locate quickly and unplug the source of any problems that arise—a feature that many IoT devices currently do not offer. Other features would manage access to each device through secure methods of user authentication; protect data by encrypting it; and provide security updates and log cyber-events so investigators can track how problems develop.Few experts have illusions these measures will solve the problem soon. The standards would be voluntary. And even if Congress were to enact laws mandating security standards, a profound security vulnerability would remain, users, themselves.""No matter how strong your system is, it's only as strong as your weakest link—and the weakest link is always the human,"" says Jason Glassberg, co-founder of Casaba Security, a leading cybersecurity firm. ""The largest breaches, the largest attacks, for the most part, have not been because of some super significantly technical attack. It's been because someone's been fooled into giving up their credentials. They've been fooled into clicking on a link that installed malware or asked them to provide their password. And it certainly doesn't change in the Internet of Things world.Ref:",46 followers,Ian Lang,4.3K,5.8K,64M,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-of-the-most-useful-IoT-Internet-of-Things-devices-for-use-at-home

Most companies rely on emerging technology in day-to-day operations. Therefore, to stay competitive on the marketplace, new technologies should be incorporated with business policies and identified as technology a source of business innovation. In response to the pandemic's economic downturn, spending will concentrate on safe and proven technologies. A variety of staff are likely to choose to start operating remotely as a result of the lock-down. This will encourage the growth of remote job optimisation technologies. Let us therefore look more closely at the technological developments in 2020 as they have a huge influence on information technology.The Internet of Things ( IoT), autonomous vehicles, extended realities, cloud computing, quantum, artificial intelligence as a service (AIaaS – a service for companies who don't or can't build databases themselves and manage their own artificial intelligence systems), digital profiling / consume analytics, customized knowledge are included in many lists of technology developments for this some of the strategic technological trends it even becomes possible to divide into the groups people-centered (Hippometry, multi-experience, democratisation, human increase, transparency and traceability). and the trends of the intelligent spaces (Empowered Edge, Distributed Cloud, Self-support, Practical Blockchain, AI Security).I chose the trends that most frequently occur in the business and that are likely to shape the technology landscape by 2025.1. Artificial IntelligenceThe concept Artificial Intelligence ( AI) is not recent and still has greater influence in the world of information technology. AI typically refers to the application of algorithms using vast numbers of data to solve particular tasks in order to generalize and/or to measure other statistical estimates. These algorithms allow a machine, like a human brain, to 'behave.' 77% of customers now use AI technology , new applications emerge every day. In the year 2030, AI Technologies will make a contribution of more than $10.7 billion to the global economy, according to PwC research, one of the leading consultancies.In areas as online retail, health, telecommunications, banking , financial advice, insurance, dealerships and government the acceptance of the AI Chatbots by service is growing. Another of the chatbots is automation, which often simplifies work for workers (but does not shorten work as it is often found out). Within the AI trend, integrated AI and machine learning (AIaAS and MLaaS) can be described as sub-trends that include types such as bots and digital help, cognitive computing APIs, machine learning frameworks and machine learning services.The high costs of AI-based systems will lead to the use of service platforms for creating AI applications. They allow our own data to be fed and algorithms or compute resources to be paid for when using them. Amazon Web Services ( AWS), Azure, Google Cloud and IBM Cloud are well known as AIaaS. Among other providers are AMS. Under the COVID-19, AI will contribute to predicting the needs of customers which are difficult to predict and enable enterprises to manage efficient logistics. under COVID-19. Chatbots will provide 24/7 assistance for customers, one of ""must have"" during lock-down. The use of machine learning will increase due to the need to improve algorithm moderators and visual materials in social networks (which often block accurate coronavirus information and do not detect fake news).2. Internet of ThingsIoT devices require Internet connectivity beyond computers and smartphones with the possibility of remote control. internet connection. It is equipped with various sensors, embedded systems and usable applications. IoT systems primarily consist of intelligent homes, wearable gadgets, health monitoring and smart city waste management. This technology allows us to predict and treat human health problems even before symptoms. In addition, much more individualized methods for prescribing and applying medicines (also known as precision medicines) are developed.Statista - The Statistics PortalIoT also fuels cutting edge computing, thus closing the businesses to data storage and calculation, enabling bandwidth and response times to be saved. IoT will profoundly transform your user experience, offering previously un-possible opportunities. The pandemic will cause people to acquire this experience as they spend almost all of their time at home. IoT tools that boost quality of life and comfort in day-to-day life can become fashionable. Tele-medicine and IoT apps will increase their use to help track human health indicators.Security, lack of international quality standards and potential reduction in the use of manual duties are among the main threats to this trend. IoT allows good control and efficiency at the same time, saves money and time and can provide a better life experience. IoT sensors, analysis of data, traceability and monitor, connected production systems , smart supply chain management, intelligent barcode readers, smart grids, connected health care systems and smart farming are the best examples of IoT-based applications. The following are the best examples.3. CybersecurityAlong with emerging technological advancement and the rise of a variety of apps, there is an growing number of possible cyber threats. The primary objective of cyber attacks is typically to access, alter or kill sensitive information and theft of user money or to avoid normal business processes. Its frequency and complexity continue to increase. Such attacks. Computers, networks and cloud protection is typically supported by firewalls, DNS filtering, malware, antivirus software, and e-mail security solutions.For organizations whose business processes are focused on technology based on data, cybersecurity is a key trend. Security and data security have been paying much more attention since the General Data Protection Regulations of the European Union (GDRP) were signed. Phishing, ransomware, cryptojacking, cyber physical attacks, state-sponsored attacks and IoT attacks are the latest cybersecurity threats. Data failure is the biggest concern for cybersecurity and the black market is still pretty lucrative in the trade in personal information. According to the cybersecurity study ElevenPaths of Telefonica, a global networking firm, 5 G will be linked to cyber threats in 2020, including key technologies such as Ransomware, cloud computing, machine intelligence, phishing attacks, open banking and mobile malware.Blockchain is one way of providing safety , particularly for IoT devices. Originally this system was introduced to store Bitcoin, the first cryptocurrency. Blockchains are distributed networks which are open to millions of users worldwide. The knowledge may only be added or modified, or copied by a cluster of the machine which is not controlled by any single person. Every data is crypto-graphically secured. During 2019, the investments in blockchain continued by FedEx, IBM, Walmart and Mastercard and will likely start showing real-world results encouraging its adoption.In these days, as thousands are forced to work remotely, private data volumes may become fully vulnerable or at the very least not secured. This emerging problem can give the development of this technology another impetus. In crowdfunding, governance, auditing of the supply channel, stock storage, prediction markets, IoT, neighborship micro grids, and stock trading, cybersecurity may also be applied to the sector.4. Extended RealityExtended Reality (XR) technologies are not news at this point, but they are now widely used for entertainment, making interactive interactions more immersive (Snapchat filters and Pokemon Go-style games). XR typically encompasses augmented reality, enhanced reality and mixed reality.Instead of viewing on a television, Virtual Reality ( VR) is using computer technology to create a virtual environment using headsets that integrate the physical world into the digital 3D environment. Contrary to VR, the Augmented Reality (RR) does not create the entire digital environment to replace actual and virtual objects on real world mobile screens or displays. Mixed reality (MR) is an extension of AR, meaning that the users can communicate with real-life digital objects (remember that the AR headset plays a holographic piano).In training, simulation and new ways of engaging with clients, the impact of virtual and enhanced reality will be rising, creating new shopping opportunities (particularly during lock-ups when thousands people go online shopping). The development of virtual resources for collaboration (Slack, Zoom) would make the workforce smaller by 2020, eliminating the need for costly office space. However, AR and VR will virtually bring workers into physical space in 2020.5. 5G Network5 G is known as the future of connectivity for the whole of the telecommunications industry and a leading edge. The 5 G networks will be implemented between 2020 and 2030 according to a vision of Huawei Technology , allowing for the likelihood that people will be linked to wired computers. These mobiles can provide us with super fast download and upload speeds (five times faster than 4 G functions) and more reliable connections.Although 5G mobile data networks were first available in 2019, they were still largely expensive and usable in restricted regions or major towns. This is anticipated that 5 G would have more cost-effective service plans and much greater coverage. And wired networks that operate in our homes and businesses will become more available. The increased bandwidth would allow growth in the IoT and smart machinery sector , allowing large amounts of data to be collected and transmitted. For regions without an Internet service or poor coverage, access to 5 G mobile Internet may be a critical necessity during a pandemic.Tech patterns are not established independently, you may have noticed, but in a synergical way. The 5 G and edge computing technology will provide the increase of computer power and become a cornerstone for the IoT applications of the next generation. The integration of AI, Big Data , IoT and Edge Computing blockchain technology helps to resolve problems with the online and offline mapping of data. AI and cloud computing will be strengthened by the growth of quantum computing. A combination of AI and IoT will result in artificial intelligence of things (AIoT). This will enable IoT devices to analyse data, make decisions and act on that data without human involvement. This combo may contribute do the development of applications for smart retail, drone traffic monitoring, smart office buildings, fleet management, autonomous driving, and autonomous delivery robots.In our view, these were the strongest technical developments. However, the coming developments entail implementing tools and human resources, and we will look at them more closely, as we promised at the beginning of the report.The first column displays technical skills, which according to Udemy research have grown in popularity between 2016 and 2019. Some of them include AI, cyber-security and cloud computing. The second and third columns are the most prominent new technical know-how in 2020. The lists indicate that machine learning, cloud computing, the programming language and other front-line frames are in high demand. Looking at different points, we note the importance of AI and Cloud computing. We can see therefore which tool this year will contribute to the evolution of technological trends.In view of emerging technological developments that are strongly interrelated, companies should adapt their strategies to reality, predict society's needs and provide solutions to future problems taking the circumstances in which we live and all work today into account.","45,565 followers",David Seidman,790,3.6K,84.6M,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-of-the-most-useful-IoT-Internet-of-Things-devices-for-use-at-home
