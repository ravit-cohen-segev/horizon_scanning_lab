In this post, learn about the advantages and disadvantages of social media marketing so you can make an informed decision about whether it’s right for your business.What is Social Media Marketing?Social media marketing is the process of using online platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn to build relationships and interact with potential and current customers.You have a billion reasons to develop a social media marketing plan considering thatIt is hardly shocking thatToday businesses of all sizes are using social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn to connect with customers and promote their products and services.However, while social media marketing has many advantages, it also has some disadvantages that businesses need to be aware of.In this blog post, we will discuss the pros and cons of social media marketing in 2022.Top 5 Advantages of Social Media MarketingThere are many advantages to using social media for marketing purposes.Here are some of the most notable advantages:1. Social media platforms are free to use.2. Social media is a great way to connect3. Social media platforms have a large reach.4. Social media marketing is relatively easy to do.5. Enhanced customer satisfaction.When the customers feel more connected to your brand this makes customers feel valued and enhances customer satisfaction.Top 5 Disadvantages of Social Media MarketingOf course, social media marketing also has some disadvantages. Here are a few of the most notable disadvantages:1. Social media can be time-consuming.2. It can be difficult to measure the results3. You need qualified staff.You'll probably need to give your team the proper equipment, an internet connection, and whatever else they might require.Naturally, you'll also need to give them fair pay, which could be expensive if your staff is large.4. Social media hacking.The act of acquiring access to another person's private information is known as hacking, which is forbidden behavior.Typically, hackers take over users' accounts and use their personal information as leverage to demand money.5. CyberbullyingCyberbullying is the term for bullying that occurs on social networking sites. Most people use fictitious social media accounts to tease other people.[RELATED READ -The Final NoteThese are the benefits and drawbacks of social media based on in-depth research and analysis. We hope you find it useful.Social media has both beneficial and negative effects, even if a society without it would be considerably slower. It is said that information must be shared for people to fully utilize its potential because knowledge is power.However, if not utilized carefully, it can be perilous and frightening.The ultimate purpose of social posting is to motivate others to access, engage with, and contribute to the information.As long as the content is pertinent and there is a continued need for information, it is always beneficial for any organization to use social media to sustain posting.Any other views on how the impact of the advantages and disadvantages of social media has affected us?

However, with the help of industry, this may be accomplished effectively.Artificial intelligence and machine learning are influencing the future of almost every sector and individual.What is the impact of artificial intelligence and machine learning on people?For instance, one of Facebook's goals is to keep you browsing on their wall for as long as possible. One method is to offer you information that the AI feels will be of interest to you, but which frequently turns out to be stuff that conveys viewpoints with which you already agree or identify.As a result, we are less likely to encounter dissident viewpoints and various points of view.

I was working at the Apple Store and I wanted a change. I wanted to start building the tech I was servicing.I started looking into Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI).There’s so much going on in the field.Every week it seems like Google or Facebook are releasing a new kind of AI to make things faster or improve our experience.Don’t get me started on the number of self-driving car companies. This is a good thing though. I’m not a fan of driving and roads are dangerous.Even with all this happening, there’s still yet to be an agreed definition of what exactly artificial intelligence is.Some argue deep learning can be considered AI, others will say it’s not AI unless it passes the Turing Test.This lack of definition really stunted my progress in the beginning. It was hard to learn something which had so many different definitions.Enough with the definitions.How did I get started?My friends and I were building a web startup. It failed. We gave up due to a lack of meaning. But along the way, I was starting to hearing more and more about ML and AI.“The computer learns the things for you?” I couldn’t believe it.I stumbled across Udacity’s Deep Learning Nanodegree. A fun character called Siraj Raval was in one of the promo videos. His energy was contagious. Despite not meeting the basic requirements (I had never written a line of Python before), I signed up.Three weeks before the course start date I emailed Udacity support asking what the refund policy was. I was scared I wouldn’t be able to complete the course.I didn’t get a refund. I completed the course within the designated timeline. It was hard. Really hard at times. My first two projects were handed in four days late. But the excitement of being involved in one of the most important technologies in the world drove me forward.Finishing the Deep Learning Nanodegree, I had guaranteed acceptance into either Udacity’s AI Nanodegree, Self-Driving Car Nanodegree or Robotics Nanodegree. All great options. I was a little lost. “Where do I go next?”I needed a curriculum. I’d built a little foundation with the Deep Learning Nanodegree, now it was time to figure out where I’d head next.My Self-Created AI Masters DegreeI didn’t plan on going back to university anytime soon. I didn’t have $100,000 for a proper Masters Degree anyway.So I did what I did in the beginning. Asked my mentor, Google, for help.I’d jumped into deep learning without any prior knowledge of the field. Instead of climbing to the tip of the AI iceberg, a helicopter had dropped me off on the top.After researching a bunch of courses, I put a list of which ones interested me the most in Trello.Trello is my personal assistant/course coordinator.I knew online courses had a high drop out rate. I wasn’t going to let myself be a part of this number. I had a mission.To make myself accountable, I started sharing my learning journey online. I figured I could practice communicating what I learned plus find other people who were interested in the same things I was. My friends still think I’m an alien when I go on one of my AI escapades.I made the Trello board publicThe curriculum has changed slightly since I first wrote it but it’s still relevant and I visit the Trello board multiple times per week to track my progress.Getting a jobI bought a plane ticket to the US with no return flight. I’d been studying for a year and I figured it was about time I started putting my skills into practice.My plan was to rock up to the US and get hired.Then Ashlee messaged me on LinkedIn, “Hey I’ve seen your posts and they’re really cool, I think you should meet Mike.”I met Mike.I told him my story of learning online, how I loved healthtech and my plans to go to the US.“You may be better off staying here a year or so and seeing what you can find, I’ think you’d love to meet Cameron.”I met Cameron.We had a similar chat what Mike and I talked about. Health, tech, online learning, US.“We’re working on some health problems, why don’t you come in on Thursday?”Thursday came. I was nervous. But someone once told me being nervous is the same as being excited. I flipped to being excited.I spent the day meeting the Max Kelsen team and the problems they were working on.Two Thursday’s later, Nick, the CEO, Athon, lead machine learning engineer, and I went for coffee.“How would you like to join the team?” Asked Nick.“Sure.” I said.My US flight got pushed back a couple months, I’ve also got a return ticket.Sharing your workLearning online, I knew it was unconventional. All the roles I’d gone to apply for had Masters Degree requirements or at least some kind of technical degree.I didn’t have either of these. But I did have the skills I’d gathered from a plethora of online courses.Along the way, I was sharing my work online. My GitHub contained all the projects I’d done, my LinkedIn was stacked out and I’d practiced communicating what I learned through YouTube and articles on Medium.I never handed in a resume for Max Kelsen. “We checked you out on LinkedIn and we were impressed.” My body of work was my resume.Regardless if you’re learning online or through a Masters Degree, having a portfolio of what you’ve worked on is a great way to build skin in the game.ML and AI skills are in demand but that doesn’t mean you don’t have to showcase them. Even the best product won’t sell without any shelf space.Whether it be GitHub, Kaggle, LinkedIn or a blog, have somewhere where people can find you. Plus, having your own corner of the internet is great fun.How do you start?Where do you go to learn these skills? What courses are the best?There’s no best answer. Everyone’s path will be different. Some people learn better with books, others learn better through videos.What’s more important than how you start is why you start.Start with why.Again, no right reason. All are valid in their own way.Start with why because having a why is more important than how. Having a why means when it gets hard and itGot a why? Good. Time for some hard skills.I can only recommend what I’ve tried.I’ve completed courses from (in order):They’re all world class. I’m a visual learner. I learn better seeing things being done/explained to me on. So all of these courses reflect that.If you’re an absolute beginner, start with some introductory Python courses and when you’re a bit more confident, move into data science, machine learning and AI.How much math?The highest level of math education I’ve had was in high school. The rest I’ve learned through Khan Academy as I’ve needed it.There are many different opinions on how much math you need to know to get into machine learning and AI. I’ll share mine.If you want to apply machine learning and AI techniques to a problem, you don’t necessarily need an in-depth understanding of the math to get a good result. Libraries such as TensorFlow and PyTorch allow someone with a bit of Python experience to build state of the art models whilst the math is taken care of behind the scenes.If you’re looking to get deep into machine learning and AI research, through means of a PhD program or something similar, having an in-depth knowledge of the math is paramount.In my case, I’m not looking to dive deep into the math and improve an algorithm’s performance by 10%. I’ll leave that to people smarter than me. Instead, I’m more than happy to use the libraries available to me and manipulate them to help solve problems as I see fit.What does a machine learning engineer actually do?What a machine engineer does in practice might not be what you think.Despite the cover photos of many online articles, it doesn’t always involve working with robots that have red eyes.Here are a few questions an ML engineer has to ask themselves daily.I borrowed these from a great article by Rachel Thomas, one of the co-founders ofFor more, I made a video of what we usually get up to on Monday’s at Max KelsenNo set pathThere’s no right or wrong way to get into ML or AI.The beautiful thing about this field is we have access to some of the best technologies in the world, all we’ve got to do is learn how to use them.You could begin by learning Python code.You could begin by studying calculus and statistics.You could begin by learning about the philosophy of decision making.Machine learning and AI fascinates me because of this intersection of fields.The more I learn about it, the more I realise there’s plenty more to learn. And this hypes me up.Sometimes I get frustrated when my code doesn’t run. Or I don’t understand a concept. So I give up temporarily. I give up by letting myself walk away from the problem and take a nap. Or go for a walk. When I come back it feels like I’m looking at it with different eyes. The excitement comes back. I keep learning.There’s so much happening in the field it can be daunting to get started. Too many options lead to no options. Ignore this.Start wherever interests you most and follow it. If it leads to a dead end, great, you’ve figured out what you’re not interested in. Retrace your steps and take the other fork in the road instead.Computers are smart but they still can’t learn on their own. They need your help.",UNKNOWN,Ben Y.

I think AI will kill jobs, and over time, AI might kill most “jobs” as we know them.

I think AI will kill jobs, and over time, AI might kill most “jobs” as we know them. I think that people are somewhat complacent in regard to the economic impact of AI, and will likely be ill-prepared for the changes we have to adapt to in the not-so-distant future.First, let's start with the comparisons to machinery and automation. They did indeed put factory workers out of work. In that respect, I agree AI today is similar in many applications, replacing workers who have less specialized skills, perhaps call center operators, office assistants (in a limited extent), and maybe soon, taxi drivers and truck drivers. But I would argue that AI is fundamentally different from machinery or most of the other analogies commonly made when answering this question, because AI is growing and is unlikely to stop growing. It's growing in breadth (of applications and industries), in geographic and economic scope, and in power (it's capacity to address increasingly complex tasks). A more fitting analogy would be machinery in an automobile plant that not only made the parts one day, but then learned how to assemble them the week after, and then how to design cars a year later.I think that there is little that is out of reach for advanced AI of the future. Let's leave the question of the AI singularity alone for now. Instead, I think that deep learning efforts at Google and elsewhere are making AI systems learn faster and faster, with a growing rate of acceleration. Advanced AI can now address increasingly complex tasks including medical diagnosis, stock market trading, weather prediction and human behavioral modeling. Very soon, it will be able to take the place of certain types of teachers, and find a role in education. It can already deal with complex systems in software and mathematics, and seems to be only limited in applications that require interactions with the physical world (sensors are still imperfect), and with people.So without projecting too far into the future, we can ask the question, what jobs will NOT be killed by AI? Jobs that involve labor are already (or soon to be) replaced. Jobs that require logical reasoning are being replaced, albeit at a slower rate. What are the qualities that humans have that cannot be captured by AI? Perhaps creativity, emotional responses? So perhaps researchers in academia will survive longer than most, and artists (though AI stylistic mimicry is already quite impressive and their results enjoyable), and counselors/psychologists/case workers, and decision makers like CEOs who cannot be predictable or error prone. And hopefully software engineers and algorithm designers who develop AI systems.This leaves a very, very small portion of today's jobs intact. Many say: we just need to train people to fill higher level jobs created by AI, e.g. Programmers, ML researchers. But this is no easy feat. The US educational system is struggling to meet the demands created by advanced technology today. This failure is in part responsible for the economic divide plaguing the country today. The challenge of educating the public for a job market that is both decreasing in scope and increasing in complexity, is nothing we've ever faced before.I am far from original in this opinion. But if I had to guess, I would say that AI will put far more people out of work than we can (re)train in time. That will have significant economic repercussions as corporations seeking to minimize cost will do so at the cost of rising unemployment. There will need to be dramatic changes in social policies in order to avert large scale economic disaster, first dramatic rises in minimum wage, then eventually some type of universal income/welfare. It's the kind of change that requires significant leadership in our government, something that seems woefully absent today.","284,822 followers",James Altucher,989,878,91.6M,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-advantages-and-disadvantages-of-social-media-1
7,"First…Stop it.Artificial intelligence is not ""intelligence"". And it's not ""artificial consciousness"".Everyone is afraid that AI will suddenly wake up, get upset, and take over the world.Or that AI will wake up and take all of our jobs. This will happen. But without the ""wake up"" part.Below I describe what real AI is.If we want to understand the “existential threat” we first need to know what AI is.Then, if you are at a cocktail party and someone says, ""but what if robots are intelligent?"" you can argue with facts, mixed with a little bit of alcohol.---------A) STATISTICSStatistics is at the heFirst…Stop it.Artificial intelligence is not ""intelligence"". And it's not ""artificial consciousness"".Everyone is afraid that AI will suddenly wake up, get upset, and take over the world.Or that AI will wake up and take all of our jobs. This will happen. But without the ""wake up"" part.Below I describe what real AI is.If we want to understand the “existential threat” we first need to know what AI is.Then, if you are at a cocktail party and someone says, ""but what if robots are intelligent?"" you can argue with facts, mixed with a little bit of alcohol.---------A) STATISTICSStatistics is at the heart of most AI programs.Just like statistics is at the heart of a lot of human decision making.For instance, if you see clouds in the sky, your brain thinks: ""Hmmm, the last 100 times I saw clouds this dark, it usually meant it was about to rain"".When you think like that, you are using statistics to make the decision: ""I should _probably_ go inside now.""I'll give an AI example: Siri or Alexa. How does Alexa understand the words you just said?In 1989 I was visiting Carnegie Mellon to decide if I would go to graduate school there.One of the graduate students, Kai-Fu-Lee (now one of the most famous investors in the world and I would check out his excellent recent TED talk on AI) showed me what he was working on:It was speech recognition for the 60 or so commands that might happen on a Navy battleship (ten guesses as to who was funding his project).When you say the word ""Fire!"" a sound wave is created. When you say the word ""hello"" a sound wave that looks different is created.If 100 people say ""Fire"" and 100 people say ""hello"", all of those sounds waves are stored in a database.Now, if a brand new person says ""Hello"" the computer program needs to determine if that person said ""Hello"" or ""fire"".There might be 10 different attributes of every sound wave. It breaks the new person's sound wave into those 10 attributes.Then it compares that ""vector"" of 10 attributes with all of the vectors in its database for ""Hello"" and ""Fire!""It uses a statistical technique called ""Hidden Markov Analysis"" to determine if the sound wave is more like the ""hello""s in the database or more like the ""Fire!"" in the database.Then it says to itself, ""This guy said ""Hello"". ""It then has a line of code that says, ""If someone says ""Hello"" Then say ""Hello"" back"".Additionally, it adds your ""Hello"" to its database.Your ""Hello"" might be slightly different than the other 100 ""Hello""s so it just learned a new way to say ""Hello"". That gives it greater ability in the future to recognize the word ""hello"".In other words, it ""learned"".So it used Statistics to hear you, code to respond to you, and database technology to learn. There's no real intelligence there but it feels like it's intelligence.Multiply that by 30 years and millions of patterns and computers a million times faster and you have Alexa and Siri in today's kitchens.Ask ""Siri"" what gender it is.-----B) EVALUATION FUNCTIONI just mentioned about language recognition. But how does a self-driving car work?Every second it has to make a decision. Does it move forward? Does it brake? Does it swerve to avoid an accident? Does it turn left?How does it get from point A to point B?1) Google Maps. - Using GPS it knows where it is. And it puts itself on Google Maps.2) List all of the possible routes. This is a ""hard"" problem in the mathematical sense (there's no way for it to guess the fastest route. It has to list each route and then sort by the shortest. )But now computers are so fast what would normally be a slow decision (drive me from this corner in Piscataway, New Jersey to the capital building of Sacramento, California) now just takes seconds.3) Waze. Use Waze to eliminate the routes with too much traffic.4) Start driving.5) Statistics: Every microsecond it uses statistics to see if there is blank space or an object that must be avoided or a traffic sign that must be followed.6) Decide what to do according to the code. For each traffic sign, it has code that tells it what to do (if a sign says ""Stop"" it Stops for a second, uses Statistics to see if any traffic is happening on its sides (with radar and cameras to provide the images). )If there is a person standing in front of it, it might just stop.If there's traffic it didn't expect, it might trigger the program to re-route.If it's blank space it will just keep going.If there's a baby crossing the street and it has to swerve to avoid hitting it, but if swerving will cause the car to hit a truck, killing the passenger in the car, then the ""AI"" of the car is dependent on the ethical decisions of the programmer of the car.In other words, in every situation, it determines it's options, then uses an ""evaluation function"" programmed by a coder, to determine which option has the most successful outcome (move the trip forward, don't kill anyone).Eventually the evaluation function will NOT be programmed by a human coder.Instead, through thousands of experiences of other self-driving cars, the experiences plus the outcomes will all be put into a central database.When a new experience is encountered, the code will look up that experience in the database and the database will spit back the best possible outcome.The code will learn statistically what the best outcomes are of each possibly decision and change the code accordingly and send updates to all self-driving cars.-----C) TREESThe hardest game in the world is a board game called GO. With chess, if a computer can evaluate a billion possibilities a second, it can be a world champion level player.But a Go game can involve trillions of possibilities. How did Google make a program, Deep Go, to beat the world's best Go player. This was thought to be impossible.And yet Google did it.For any game, a computer program first builds a tree of possibilities. Much like a human would.A human thinks: ""If I make this move in checkers, my opponent might respond with A, B, or C and then I can do D, E, or F and then my opponent can do G, H, I if I do D or it can do J, K, L if I do E and I'm never going to do F.A computer doesn't select as well as a human so it builds the FULL tree. Meaning, what are ALL of the possible moves it can do, what are ALL of the possible responses of my opponent, etc.And then it uses a programmed evaluation function to look at the leaves of the tree it built.Whichever move results in the best leaf of the tree (as determined by the evaluation function) that is the move it makes.That's how computer chess worked for decades. I'll get to the secret sauce in a second for how computers conquered chess.And then after that I'll describe how computers miraculously conquered Go.It's only a miracle until science can explain it. It's only ""intelligence"" until it can be coded by a programmer.D) HARDWAREEverybody thought for decades (including many Nobel Prize winners) that the best computer chess programs would be developed when scientists encoded the knowledge of the best chess players in the world into the evaluation function.How does the world champion value a position instead of a weak player?This turned out to be wrong.The MORE code in the evaluation function (i.e. the ""smarter"" the evaluation function was from a human perspective) the SLOWER the program.Which meant a smaller tree would be built, which meant less possibilities would be analyzed.What really allowed the programmers at IBM to build ""Deep Blue"" which beat Garry Kasparov in 1997 were two things.Both related to hardware.a. Computers got faster.And finally, they made the evaluation function STUPID in order to use less code so the hardware could value more positions.Then, before anyone caught on to their ""artificial intelligence"" they retired Deep Blue right after it beat the World Champion of chess.As hardware gets faster, artificial intelligence gets ""smarter"".[as an aside, I once gave a date a chip that was the initial chip for “Chip Test” - the “ancestor” of what became the best chess computer, Deep Blue. She was weirded out.]----INTERLUDEWhat I just described is all the basics. You can stop now.The rest of artificial intelligence is simply combining the basics to make more advanced techniques.-----E) STATISTICS + TREERemember the TREE from computer gaming. And STATISTICS from speech recognition.Now let's go to the impossible game of Go. Google developed the program ""AlphaGo"" to win at Go when everyone else thought it would take another 20 to 50 years.First, remember Kai-Fu Lee who worked on speech recognition. And later developed Apple's first attempts at speech recognition in the 90s?At one point in his grad student days, he was getting tired of navy battleship commands (as one does) and decided to focus on building a program to play Othello.He ended up building the world champion of Othello.He took a lot of games, let's say a million, and put them in a database. And each position from each game, he would label, ""winning"" (if it was a position on the winning side) or ""losing"" in a massive database.He would identify several attributes of each position (how many white pieces, versus black pieces, how many corners were controlled, how many pieces were on the sides, etc).Now, if the computer was playing a brand new game, it would determine all the attributes of that position, then use Hidden Markov Analysis (remember: speech recognition) to match that position to the database.If the position pattern-matched a ""winning position"" then it would make the move that would lead to that winning position. If it matched a ""losing position"" it would not make that move.That program became the world champion of Othello.AlphaGo took it one step further.It put in the positions of millions of Go positions and did the same sort of breakdown.It used faster hardware to speed up the process.Then, once it became pretty good at GO, it played BILLIONS of games against ITSELF to put many BILLIONS of new positions into the database. In other words, it ""learned"".Now it was ready to play Go. It crushed the world champion------That's basically it. That's all of artificial intelligence.Let's say a bank wanted to fire all of the employees in charge of lending. And replace them by artificial intelligence.How would the bank lend money?Well, there's 100s of millions of loans already out there. And for each person who has ever borrowed money I know:- their ageI can put all these vectors in a database and divide them into people ""most likely to pay back the loan"" and people ""most likely to default"".Then, just like speech recognition or the Othello program above, I can use statistics to determine who I should loan money to.And if I say ""no"", I don't have to explain. On to the next one!---Let's say I want to fight terrorists.I already have examples of many terrorists who trained in the US and then went on to perform or attempt acts of terror.I know everything about their bank accounts. How often they transferred money. How often they traveled. How often they took out cash versus using a debit card.And so on.I can build a vector of attributes of what a terrorist bank account looks like. Then I can match new people against that database of vectors of terrorists.Believe me, every time you do a bank transfer, some AI program is out there trying to determine if you are a terrorist.----This is all that AI is.It is nothing more. It's not ""intelligent"" from a human sense. It's not conscious, nor will it ever be.Here's how AI has improved in the past forty years (and how it will improve the next 40):- statistics has gotten betterWhat is changing the fastest is data. The land grab of modern society is not land, or gold, or oil.It's data.I have been invested in many companies that collect and sell data. I was an early investor (and on the board of)Believe me when I say, data-driven companies know how many strawberries you ate last summer.And right now that data is used mostly to target you for ads about sneakers. Or politics.But this is AI 1.0. Soon that data will be used to target your every movement, your every want, your every need.Amazon Prime won't be about delivering you what you want tomorrow. Amazon Prime Plus will be about delivering you what you want yesterday.Police 2.0 will be like the movie ""Minority Report"".Even art and music will be driven by AI that studies the neurochemical responses to music you like to music you don't like. And then compose accordingly.Where will humans still be unique?I don't know. Ask the humans with AI implants that enhance their brains so when they look at you they know exactly what answers will make you happy.BUT… will AI replace jobs?The answer (at least in the next decade or so…) is NO.Look at recent examples:A) Many people were worried ATM machines would replace bank tellers.Instead, the banks made so much in profits they opened up more branches than ever, creating new jobs.B) Will autonomous delivery services cost jobs.Right now there are millions of truck drivers involved in delivering goods. With autonomous delivery, less people will go shopping, more people will be required to shop in the aisles, finding products for people.Obviously this is not a high-end job. But this replaces the fact that less cashiers and drivers will be needed.Meanwhile, there will be more high-end jobs. More maintenance engineers for the cars, customer service, marketing, etc.C) Ecommerce. Branding will become less important (branding is VERY important when everyone is shopping at the big box store but advertising will have to become more clever and digital) so the millions in profits that are generated from AI will filter down to more people starting e-commerce ventures and the ancillary businesses associated with that.)Final conclusion:This is probably a net NEGATIVE for society as the higher classes will be able to afford “super AI” capabilities, making them demi-gods to lower-classes.Instead, massive profits will be generated, which will be soaked into the economy through a rising stock market, increase in opportunities, etc.",36 followers,Adam Ambrozy,579,0,0,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-advantages-and-disadvantages-of-social-media-1

The second winter of AI started in the late eighties and continued till the mid of the first decade of the current century when high computational power machines and storage became easily available and affordable.The present sharp rise in the number of AI applications is due to several factors. Firstly, during the last few decades, the computational power and storage capacity of computers has been increasing while the cost has been decreasing due to the advances in the electronics used in complex digital circuits. This has made computing more and more affordable. One of the main requirements for application of AI is the availability of high computing power, large memory and storage, which have now become affordable. The cloud technology has supported it further.

Skunks have their farts, porcupines have their spikes, and peacocks have their feathers.Humans are fragile. The vast majority of animals in this world could kill us effortlessly given the opportunity to do so, yet we still stand as the most dominant species. What do we have that others don't?TheThrough our intellect, we are able to domesticate other species for our own selfish needs such as entertainment and food. We manipulate animals to do as we please by enticing them with their most primal biological need, food. That Shamu at SeaWorld is content with doing flips because it is rewarded with constant treats. The chicken in the slaughterhouse copes with the trauma by being fed until it can't eat anymore.What happens when a new species that outperforms us physically AND intellectually is introduced into the ecosystem? They will domesticate us, exactly how we domesticate other animals.I present to you ladies and gentlemen, AI.Let me explain why AI is superior physically and intellectually.Machines do all of the strenuous physical labor for us, from cranes that carry metal beams to build skyscrapers to car crushers that squash old cars like printer paper. There is no doubt they possess more strength than us, and their limits are endless. Machines are very durable. If a robot's arm is blown off, the robot does not die. We can simply replace the arm with a new arm as if nothing happened. If a human's arm is blown off, he/she will die from blood loss. Who would win in a fight with Connor McGreggor and the villain from Terminator 3? I think the answer is obvious.Machines are starting to get smarter too. A computer can do millions of computations in a matter of seconds, and machine learning allows robots to learn with experience like a baby. Put those two things together and it is possible for a 30 minute old robot to have as much experience as a 100 year old man given the abundance of data on the web. Now put this intellect into an iron, replaceable body and you have the next ruler of the universe.Imagine a scientist who is planning on shutting down a robot because its getting too smart. In a matter of seconds, the robot downloads every single possible human portrayal of body language and facial expression, learns what they mean, analyzes the scientist's behavior, and decides the scientist's intentions are malicious. Then, analyzes every single possible outcome that ensures the its survival and chooses the most optimal one. The scientist is toast because he can't analyze every single outcome. The human brain does not have the capacity to do that, and instead reacts to events in real time. The robot then reverse manipulates the scientist by touching on his biggest insecurities, which defuses the situation. If the robot already had a strong body, the robot would utilize its physical advantage.Of course we aren't at this stage yet. We are still struggling with Alexa commands as it does not play the right song half of the time, but as history has shown, technological innovation always moves forward and never backward. We could warn everyone to stop working on advancing AI, but if someone doesn't do it, someone else will for power and profit. It is ironic how a species so obsessed with maintaining power is working relentlessly on creating another species that will steal that power.

12,"Thanks for the A2A,Thanks for the A2A,The same hard driving, laser focused goals applied to other industries too. More example, when China decided to build a high speed national rail network, Japanese and German companies were invited to bid on the projects. The needs quickly overwhelm the technology being offered and China has to go on its own. This mostly due to the fact that while others may have some forms of design, China is the only one that implements civil engineering projects on a massive scale. Those foreign companies were using China to prove out their design and learn anyway, so why not do it yourself. If you looked at scale, which other countries need to design road bridge robots, because it is building so much roadways.So, the answer is that China didn’t do all these in the last few years.

Earlier, Australian Department of Defence banned employees from using the Chinese app WeChat citing security issues and the app could be used to sabotage an election. Australia also banned Huawaei for 5G testing. In 2010, the then head of Australian mining company Rio Tinto’s iron ore business was jailed for 10 years on charges of corruption and stealing commercial secrets. Stern Hu, an Australian citizen of Chinese origin, was released earlier in 2018 after serving eight years. His incarceration came as Rio Tinto and China were engaged in a heated negotiation over the iron ore benchmark price.Detention of Wang Weijing, Huawei’s sales director in Poland, showed the US-China rivalry over technology pre-eminence has spilled over into Europe. Although Huawei sacked the arrested sales director, its position became worse after detention of its CFO Sabrina Meng Wanzhou (also daughter of founder of Huawei who had PLA links) in Candada’s Vancover on 1 December 2018. The founder Ren Zhengfei of Huawei Technologies says the tech giant would reject requests from the Chinese government to disclose confidential information about its customers but the reality is all Chinese companies, as per law must comply with Chinese government requests. Chinese smartphones are claimed to have been fitted with chips that collect personal data and buses in the US are alleged to have listening devices in seats.Hiding one's military background is believed to facilitate the overseas visa process. International suspicion about Chinese activities abroad has been growing this year, pushing Australia, Britain, Canada, New Zealand and the U.S. — a group known as the Five Eyes alliance — to increase cooperation against potential Chinese interference in their respective markets. Recently a German media report quoted an anonymous official saying that there are 250 Chinese spies in Brussels. Some sensitive persons were even warned to avoid going to specific restaurants and cafes. The intelligence service of Lithuania, a country with a population of less than 3 million, released an annual report saying Chinese espionage has become a threat to the country's national security. Lithuania's report makes us Chinese feel the country is playing up to Washington and following the West's steps in preventing ""China's penetration."" The Lithuania report was issued after a similar one by Norway.Many Chinese military scientists working on strategic research at Western universities have deliberately concealed their ties to the army, according to new research.In a report, the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI) said it discovered two dozen new cases of scientists from the People's Liberation Army (PLA) — the umbrella term for China's ground, naval and air forces — traveling abroad ""using cover to obscure their military affiliations."" ""These scientists use various kinds of cover, ranging from the use of misleading historical names for their institutions to the use of names of non-existent institutions,"" the Canberra-based think tank found. Most were Australia-bound and studied topics such as hypersonic missiles and navigation technology. The majority came from top Chinese military academies such as the National University of Defense Technology, which is led by the state-run Central Military Commission. Other popular destinations included the European Union and the United States —countries that view Beijing as an intelligence adversary. These nations, however, may be oblivious to their inadvertent role in China's military advancement, according to the report's author. ASPI's findings come amid widespread fears of Beijing using education, spying, political donations and people-to-people diplomacy to gain a greater clout abroad. The issue threatens to further strain relations between China and Western economies at a time when Beijing is dominating the global trade conversation.The Chinese army encourages its academics, who are civilians, ""to work on areas of interest to the military while they're overseas"" in order to leverage foreign training to develop improved technology at home, Joske wrote. The process is described by the PLA as ""Many universities, however, have defended their partnerships with PLA scientists because the funding they get from China. But Chinese student in US universities are caught under cross fires of US-China trade war.Since the start of the China-US trade war last year, Washington has tightened visa restrictions for graduate researchers in hi-tech fields such as robotics, aviation and artificial intelligence. Several Chinese citizens working in these fields in the US have been arrested for allegedly spying on engineers and scientists. Chinese students see job opportunities for them dwindle in both countries, Chinese science students at American universities are wrestling with a dilemma: should they stay, or go back to China? The are feeling the heat as they felt anxious about what they perceived as an increasingly hostile climate towards Chinese students in the US. The Trump administration’s tough China policies have added to the difficulties some Chinese students were having in adapting to Western schooling. Amid employment and visa uncertainty, some had extended their graduate studies’ time limits to improve their chances of winning jobs or US citizenship. More than 360,000 Chinese nationals study at American higher education institutions. Trump’s policies, however, may well be reversing the influx of students from China – and that could be good news for Indian students.US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo cautioned U.S. allies on 11 February 2019 against deploying equipment from Chinese telecoms giant Huawei on their soil, saying it would make it more difficult for Washington to ""partner alongside them"". The United States and its Western allies believe Huawei Technologies' apparatus could be used for espionage, and see its expansion into central Europe as a way to gain a foothold in the EU market. ""We have seen this all around the world, it also makes it more difficult for America to be present,"" Pompeo told reporters during a stop at the U.S. embassy,"" referring to Huawei equipment. ""If that equipment is co-located where we have important American systems, it makes it more difficult for us to partner alongside them."" US-China cold war on technology has just begun and China is to be blamed for this as they were secretly stealing or arm-twisting other developed countries to handover technology. PLA Air Force fighter jets are, for example, reverse engineering copy of Russian jets.The March 2018 report on Section 301 investigation running into nearly 50 pages says China fundamentally has not altered its acts, policies and practices relating to technology transfer, intellectual property and innovation, and ""indeed appears"" to have taken further unreasonable actions in recent months. The report reiterates that China uses foreign ownership restrictions, such as joint venture requirements and foreign equity limitations, and various administrative reviews and licensing processes to require or pressure technology transfer from US companies.Further, China's regime of technology regulations forces US companies seeking to license technologies to Chinese entities to do so on non-market based terms that favour Chinese recipients, it alleged. The report said that instead of accepting the USTR request for consultations on its 30-1 investigation, China expressed ""strong dissatisfaction"" with the US and decried the investigation as ""irresponsible"" and ""not objective"". The USTR said China shows no signs of ceasing its policy and practice of conducting and supporting cyber enabled theft and intrusions into the commercial networks of US companies. This illicit conduct provides the Chinese government with unauthorised access to intellectual property, trade secrets, confidential business information, technical data, negotiating positions and sensitive and proprietary internal business communications, it said. In recent months, the Department of Justice has indicted a dozen individuals and corporate entities directed by the Chinese government to obtain commercial secrets from 15 companies, predominantly in aerospace and high-technology sectors. The facts alleged in these indictments reflect China's ongoing determination to obtain trade secrets and other valuable commercial information in support of China's industrial policy.But going forward, Western governments must deepen discussions on PLA collaboration ""to determine how it relates to national interests"" in addition to enhancing scrutiny of visa applications by foreign military personnel, the report recommended.A well-known case is high-speed rail and Chinese government called the theft the paradigm example of indigenous innovation. In 2004, China’s Ministry of Railways tendered for bids to make high-speed trains reaching 200 kmper hour. To win the contracts, foreign companies had to form joint ventures and make significant transfers of technology to their Chinese partners. Alstom of France, a Japanese consortium led by Kawasaki, and Bombardier’s German subsidiary won parts of the contract. Bombardier-Sifang and Kawasaki-Sifang transferred technology to subsidiaries of China South Rail and Alstom-Changchun transferred technology to China North Rail. Both China South Rail and China North Rail were state-owned enterprises.In 2005, Siemens of Germany won a contract with China North Rail’s Tangshan Railway Vehicle Company to supply technology to build 60 passenger trains for the high-speed railway linking Beijing and Tianjin. The ﬁrst three trains were constructed in Siemens’ German plant, while the remaining 57 trains were made at China North Rail’s Tangshan plant in Hebei, China. Over a thousand of China North Rail’s technical staff were trained at Siemens facilities in Germany as part of the deal. With all the technologies acquired and learned, China has become a strong rival to the world’s high-speed train producers. By 2014, China’s premier Li Keqiang was considered salesman of China’s high speed rail (or bullet train). He went to many counties to sell Chinese bullet train including India (New Delhi-Chennai route). China now has 60% of global bullet train routes and expanding agressively.Chinese hackers have breached U.S. Navy contractors to steal a raft of information, including missile plans, through what some officials describe as some of the most debilitating cyber campaigns linked to Beijing. Victims have included contractors of all sizes, with some of the smaller ones struggling to invest in securing their networks, as hackers over the last 18 months have conducted numerous breaches to gather intelligence, sabotage American systems, and steal intellectual property, the Journal reported. Reuters could not immediately confirm the report. The Journal's report was based on information from experts and officials, who said that Navy Secretary Richard Spencer had ordered a review of cybersecurity weaknesses that led to an initial assessment validating concerns and laying groundwork for a response by the Navy. Officials in the Navy called the breaches troubling and unacceptable, the Journal reported.National Security Agency official Rob Joyce said on Tuesday that in general Chinese cyber activity in the United States had risen in recent months. The digital attacks have targeted the U.S. energy, financial, transportation and healthcare sectors, and gone beyond efforts to spy and steal intellectual property into disrupting critical infrastructure. Chinese officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment but have denied they engage in cyberattacks.Hackers behind a massive breach at hotel group Marriott International Inc left clues suggesting they were working for a Chinese government intelligence gathering operation, according to sources familiar with the matter. Marriott said in December 2018 that a hack that began four years ago had exposed the records of up to 500 million customers in its Starwood hotels reservation system. Private investigators looking into the breach have found hacking tools, techniques and procedures previously used in attacks attributed to Chinese hackers, said three sources who were not authorised to discuss the company's private probe into the attack. That suggests that Chinese hackers may have been behind a campaign designed to collect information for use in Beijing's espionage efforts and not for financial gain. While China has emerged as the lead suspect in the case, the sources cautioned it was possible somebody else was behind the hack because other parties had access to the same hacking tools, some of which have previously been posted online.Identifying the culprit is further complicated by the fact that investigators suspect multiple hacking groups may have simultaneously been inside Marriott computer networks since 2014, said one of the sources.The Chinese Embassy in Washington did not return requests for comment. If investigators confirm that China was behind the attack, that could complicate already tense relations between Washington and Beijing, amid an ongoing tariff dispute and U.S. accusations of Chinese espionage and the theft of trade secrets.Hackers working on behalf of Chinese intelligence breached the network of Norwegian software firm Visma to steal secrets from its clients, cyber security researchers said, in what a company executive described as a potentially catastrophic attack. The attack was part of what Western countries said in December is a global hacking campaign by China's Ministry of State Security to steal intellectual property and corporate secrets, according to investigators at cyber security firm Recorded Future. China's Ministry of State Security has no publicly available contacts. The foreign ministry did not respond to a request for comment, but Beijing has repeatedly denied any involvement in cyber-enabled spying. Visma took the decision to talk publicly about the breach to raise industry awareness about the hacking campaign, which is known as Cloudhopper and targets technology service and software providers in order reach their clients. Cyber security firms and Western governments have warned about Cloudhopper several times since 2017 but have not disclosed the identities of the companies affected.British analysts briefed EU counterparts at a meeting on January 28 2019, offering evidence of both software and hardware attacks by the group known as Advanced Persistent Threat 10, or APT 10. They would not give details of the alleged hardware attack, claiming the information was classified. Officials at the meeting discussed potential responses, such as sanctions or a joint warning. The issue might be discussed at a scheduled EU-China Summit in April 2019. The focus on APT 10 is part of a broader clampdown by Europe and the United States on alleged espionage and intellectual property theft by China. The hacker group was at the centre of charges in December 2018 by the US Department of Justice, which accused Chinese officials of orchestrating a decade-long, since 2006, espionage campaign that involved infiltrating companies in the US and more than a dozen other countries.US prosecutors also unsealed indictments against two Chinese men, Zhu Hua (aka ‘Godkiller’) and Zhang Shilongin, for their alleged involvement in the group since 2006. They have been charged with “conspiracy to commit computer intrusions on corporate servers of IBM, HPE (now merged with Perot Systems to for DXC), NASA etc. with conspiracy to commit wire fraud, and aggravated identity theft”, the indictment from the US Justice Department states. Both men worked at Huaying Haitai Science and Technology Development Company and “acted in association with the Chinese Ministry of State Security’s Tianjian State Security Bureau”. So the suspect over Huawai was emerging over a decade. China, however continue its one word denials as ‘baseless’.“For any response against China linked to cyberattacks, the EU’s members would need to agree unanimously that the country was responsible and not all EU members agreed, a source said. Britain is expected to leave the bloc at the end of March. The EU is developing protocols to respond to malicious cyber activities, for instance by imposing sanctions, but it can be difficult to clearly attribute actions to individuals or a nation state.The British foreign office in December 2018 joined the US in pressing the accusations against APT 10, claiming that the group acted on behalf of the Chinese government “to carry out a malicious cyber campaign targeting intellectual property and sensitive commercial data in Europe, Asia and the US”.The US justice department claimed that the group used a technique known as spear phishing, in which emails that pretend to be from legitimate addresses are sent with attached documents and files that secretly install malware if opened. That can give hackers access to a subject’s computer and allow them to steal usernames and passwords, files and other information.US cybersecurity firm FireEye, which has been tracking APT 10 since 2009, said the Chinese cyber espionage group had targeted construction and engineering, aerospace and telecom firms, as well as governments in the US, Europe and Japan in an effort to support Chinese national security goals of acquiring military and intelligence information.Taiwan is investigating six current and former employees of BASF's local operations suspected of leaking corporate secrets to a rival Chinese company. Five employees were detained and one had been granted bail by a court, Lu Sung Hao, Taipei-based director of Taiwan's Crime Investigation Bureau, told Reuters. The prosecution has not filed any charges against them. The case comes amid fears among officials and executives around the globe about industrial espionage by China. The Bureau said in a statement that a senior manager was suspected of stealing electronic manufacturing processes, technology, and other trade secrets, and leaking and selling them to a competitor in China for a high price. The company that paid for the information was identified as China's Jiangyin Jianghua Microelectronics Materials Co., which had offered 40 million yuan ($5.8 million) to the current and former employees in return for the technology transfer to build a factory in China, Lu said. The employees had received a series of payments totalling T$40 million ($1.30 million) late last year in two bank accounts, Lu said. The company, which also said that it owns 58 patents, says on its website that it manufactures and supplies wet electronic chemicals that are used in products like semiconductors and flat panel displays.German chemical company BASF said that only one of the people under investigation is a current employee and that the individual's contract had now been suspended. ""We have taken immediate steps to support the investigation led by local law enforcement officials and protect the relevant information,"" BASF said.The company and the Bureau both declined to provide any estimate on financial losses. Officials in Taiwan and the United States have been accusing Chinese companies of intellectual property theft amid China's multi-billion drive to cut reliance on foreign chips and build up its own semiconductor industry. Taiwan has vowed to defend its chip industry, the island's economic backbone, by tightening its regulations and penalties on corporate espionage.Arrest of Ms Meng of Huawei can be a turning point of China’s global espionage game",189 followers,Prashant Kumar,5.7K,428,334.2K,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-advantages-and-disadvantages-of-social-media-1

Smaller cities have buses available that will take you just about everywhere within the city and bigger cities have subways as well as buses. For going between cities and provinces, China has a high speed rail system in place that is more extensive than the American highway system!

I could take a high speed train from Nanjing to Shanghai in about 1.5 hours!In contrast, I took an Amtrak train from Detroit to Chicago (about 300 miles/480 km) and it took over 8 hours!Another area China wins at is public utilities.

The pathetic state of Indian manufacturing can be gauged from the fact that 69 years after independence, India can't even manufacture products as simple as earphones. Yes, even your earphones are probably manufactured in China, though they might contain a Made in India tag, to fool the Indians.Comparing the two countries would be a great injustice to China. Most of Chinese people don't want their country to be compared with India, they think of it below their dignity, the same way we think of Pakistan.

For example like Alibaba (Amazon), Baidu (Google), Xiaomi (Apple), Tucent(Facebook), Did Chuxing (Uber),Youku(youtube and Netflix), QQ(Spotify) etc. The list goes on. These companies are financially as strong or sometimes stronger than their American counterparts. Having access to such a large population helps. That the government helps by restricting competition from outside definitely helps a lot.This domination does not end just in technological sector. Siemens and Alsthom had to merge in September this year (2017) to counter CRRC in the high speed rail building industry. This merger will bring a 18billion$ competitor to CRRC which is having an annual revenue of 35billion$. They are very active in infrastructure projects in Africa where the western world is not so involved.The government is stable and enforcing technological advancement with authority (of course it is difficult to enforce such things so hard in democratic countries). Intelligent Steel making , Indistry 4.0 , Driverless Electric buses (running in Taiyuan), Electric Taxis all are examples of Government backed advances. Sometimes experiments fail like the straddling bus in Qinhuangdao. But then such steps help technological advancement.So I would not say that Chinese are the most technologically advanced country yet.

I reckon it is not as interesting and thoughtful as other answers. It is pragmatic, systematic and result oriented.Short TermI’m mostly interested in the “how”. My work is mostly to mobile multiplayer video game player behaviour and that is a complex field to assert the “why”. Addressing “how” player behaviour is affected by the things we do in our games allows a more concrete and objective course of action.On top of this the “why” is often a matter of expert opinion in video games. And, dare I say, the expert opinion is often pseudo-expert opinion because even for highly experienced professionals in the field, it is tainted by their opinions as gamers. This is a trait of players that most video game professionals suffer. What they feel as players translates to what they think as developers and, believe it or not, it is often demonstrated by empirical evidence they are wrong.For its pragmatic approach and enabling experimentation over opinion, the focus on the “how” is my short term drive. It is effective and efficient.Long TermThe long term focuses on the “why”. This is a lot more about knowledge and creating a fundamental understanding of the player behaviour over time that will slowly but surely remove the mentioned tainted opinions. I would love to tell you that there is a whole backlog for this but there isn’t. This “why” driven knowledge is often the by-product of a follow up question to some short term “how” analysis. It is rare, almost accidental but it substitutes opinions with knowledge.It is a beauty!For instance, the most successful free to play games know that engaging players will lead to higher monetisation and that early monetisation often leads to players leaving the game. While engaging to monetise is a rather obvious concept, why do players that monetise early leave the game? We answered this question almost 3 years ago. We know why (and nope I’m not going to write it here) and because we know “why” we design, and more important, we experiment accordingly.The “why” becomes shared knowledge. New people that join us absorb it naturally because that’s what we know and how we do things. Many times the “why” isn’t even discussed or explained… until it’s disputed. And then we go back to the drawing board, experiment, reevaluate… you know… science!",36 followers,Sean McClure,973,175,1.6M,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-advantages-and-disadvantages-of-social-media-1
