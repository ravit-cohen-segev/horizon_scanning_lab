I would say technology’s job is to work for us and what we value, not the other way around: that’s the main role, I think.TLDR: I think we have an opportunity to help out specific students more, rather than cater to many students in general. And, I think students will be able to speed up or slow down more easily, rather than needing to stick to a specific set pace. There are many other things too, of course, but I think these two would count for good progress.Here are aGreat question!

Before cellphones, we relied on hand raising and picking a few students to speak. Now, the teacher is moreMore broadly, I’d say these things (among others) are valued in Mathematics Education:None of these things are asking for a specific technology. And, they are pretty hard to measure (How do you know before hand what ‘exhibits critical thought’ will look like? It is more likely that you’ll know it when you see it.). Whereas tests are easier to implement and gives simple measurements — this will often collapse efforts to get to the more valued stuff (“I care about critical thinking, but we need __% on the ___ test to get this funding!”)I don’t see that the role of technology will be one specific thing, rather we will continue to have these battles between things that are easy to measure and scale up, against things that are more worthwhile but harder to measure or scale.Thanks for the great question, cheers!",18 followers,Asim Qureshi,1K,996,155.4M,https://www.quora.com/What-will-be-the-role-of-technology-in-education-in-the-next-10-years
1,"Students find school boring. Why? Not because it’s “boring” in real, but because “school slowly became a place of memorizing facts just long enough to get the A, doing the bare minimum to get into the best college”, school teach them only how to pass exams, which has a little in common with real life.They think testing should use a combination of critical thinking and prior knowledge. And teachers should make it more about the learning experience, and more like real life.That’s why I think experimental learning is the feature of education.

2,"School districts will adopt new technologies that use student standardized test data to determine teacher pay and retention.  They will use data to draw indefensible conclusions that lead to illogical decisions, such as evaluating a PE teacher based on student math scores or evaluating an 11th grade English teacher using the previous year's scores and promoting administrators based on unvetted trends in the number of discipline referrals.Oh, wait... They're already doing all of this nonsense, and more.I do understand that among people who design software etc etc that the viewpoint of a teacherSchool districts will adopt new technologies that use student standardized test data to determine teacher pay and retention.

They're already doing all of this nonsense, and more.I do understand that among people who design software etc etc that the viewpoint of a teacher who has worked in public ed for many years may hold little weight.  However, I believe these people need to consider this: our problem is not content. Our problems are political and social, and they can't be fixed by technology.School boards are forced to do lots of things by the state boards and the legislature and the abuse of data, particularly test data, would astound you if you were actually aware if it.  The sad truth is that this is how technology is actually being used.  No one who is making the big decisions cares at all about replacing textbooks or any of the other more sensible objectives the other posts are referring to.  They care about pointing to a trend on a graph and declaring that they have improved something, so they can get reelected.","135,257 followers",Hector Quintanilla,582,1.2K,88.3M,https://www.quora.com/What-will-be-the-role-of-technology-in-education-in-the-next-10-years
3,"Backbone To Education- TechnologyWhenever someone mentions the words ‘learning’ and ‘education’, the first image that pops up in everyone’s mind is that of a classroom with a teacher and forty or so students studying using a blackboard and a chalk.

However, we live in the 21st century where educational tools are constantly evolving and have come a long way from ink pens, quills and wooden slates to smart boards, blogging applications and online tutorials. Technological advancement has taken us by storm and the education sector is no exception. It has replaced almost everything that was once considered crucial to impart education with gadgets and applications that have made our lives immensely easier.Technology Helps Students And the Teachers AlikeThese technological changes have benefitted the students and the teachers alike. In recent years, technology has opened several new doors in the form of new learning opportunities for students through online courses, distance learning programs, online tutorials and digitized classrooms. Although technology can not completely replace teachers and professors, it has now shifted their role from being the core source of information to being guides needed to help interpret and understand this information. Online courses and distance learning programs not only enable people​ to access and enrol in courses offered by various universities and educational institutions that would have been otherwise inaccessible to them but also helps them acquire new skills in the comfort of their own homes​. This method of learning is cost effective, flexible as you can study whatever you want and self paced because most of the online courses let an individual work according to his own timeline.It is a Big global village !Technology thus promotes self learning in the long run and brings the global village to the student’s place of residence. It not only helps people enhance their knowledge and develop real world skills but also enables them to interact with their fellow classmates from all over the world thereby inculcating strong communication skills and introducing them to various different cultures.Choose your Pick – eBooks, podcasts, educational videos, educational games, tutorialsEducational resources, now, are only a click away and widely available on the internet to anyone who is interested in learning. Resources like eBooks, podcasts, educational videos, educational games, tutorials etc. are easily accessible and are not only used extensively by individuals but are also being increasingly used by teachers in classrooms as a supplement during their lectures. Apart from these, a huge number of educational computer softwares are now available in the markets that have simplified the learning of complicated algorithms and concepts. Although they do come with a certain number of disadvantages but they are outweighed by the numerous benefits of using such softwares. Educational videos and visual aids promote learning inside as well as outside the classroom and have a much deeper impact on the viewer’s mind than simple textbooks. Advanced technical aids in the education sector work on the principle of experience and let an individual experience concepts and theories. This enhances the student’s analytical skills, proficiency and critical thinking while making understanding comparatively easy. This would have been impossible five decades ago when technology wasn’t as advanced as we have it today.Interactive ClassroomsTechnological advancements have not only benefited students but have also helped teachers immensely. They can now integrate various spheres of education through online presentations and online quizzes while ensuring that their classes remain interactive. An article by the National Math and Science Initiative even showed that students tend to remain focused and get better results if blended teaching methods are used especially for subjects like science, technology and maths. In addition to this, virtual lesson plans, online tests and grading programs help teachers save a lot of energy and time which can be used to enhance the classroom teaching experience.Technology has its pitfalls tooWhile technology has definitely made our lives easier, it comes with it’s own pitfalls. It is important to remember that the overuse of anything can be detrimental in the long run. Thus, educators​ all across the globe need to maintain a healthy balance while using gadgets and technology in the classrooms. Afterall the future of the world does lie on the shoulders of the youth. We don’t need a generation of smart phones and dumb people, do we?","74,988 followers",Neman Ashraf,4.5K,410,36.8M,https://www.quora.com/What-will-be-the-role-of-technology-in-education-in-the-next-10-years

Examples of soft skills include communication abilities, teamwork and problem-solving skills as well as time management and effective leadership qualities.From working in hotels, restaurants or bars to running conferences and events, the increasingly popular hospitality industry offers a lot of potential for career development and has a variety of roles to choose from. If you want to pursue a career in hospitality, however, it’s important to first focus on building your soft skills in order to stand out to employers and progress in your career.Here are of the most important soft skills to focus on before pursuing a career in the industry:Communication skillsMost of the daily responsibilities when working in the hospitality and industry sectors are customer facing, making effective communication skills key. You’ll be interacting with people from a range of backgrounds and ages so it’s important to be able to effectively present information to them and understand their needs. These skills can be a make or break in the industry and are ultimately what will keep your customers coming back for more.Emotional intelligenceWhile industries today are becoming increasingly digitised, it is human contact that lies at the heart of hospitality and tourism, making it a relatively stable field to pursue. As a service-reliant industry, a lot of your job will involve dealing with customers’ complaints or issues. Being able to resolve these issues in a calm and timely manner will help you develop a top-rated customer experience.TeamworkThe hospitality sector is fast-paced and ever-changing, meaning that you will need to work closely with your team if you want everything to run smoothly, especially during peak season. Excellent teamwork skills improve performance with your team and encourage you and your co-workers to excel, even on the most challenging of days. These interpersonal skills also help to provide a positive customer experience. You are more likely to keep your clients using your service again if you are shown to be running a tight ship with a team of organised and helpful employees.Time managementCareers in hospitality and tourism will often require you to work on several tasks at once, especially during peak season. Having the ability to keep calm under pressure and manage a heavy workload through good time management will help you go far in this fast-paced industry.A positive attitudePositivity is infectious. Having a can-do attitude towards the tasks at hand will not only give you more fulfilment in your day-to-day role, but it will rub off on your co-workers too. Maintaining a positive attitude is also central to customer service and will help you build a loyal relationship with your clients. It’s important to remember that customers are everything in this sector. Your guests are ultimately the ones ensuring your business survives, so providing a positive customer experience is paramount.Want to launch your career in the dynamic hospitality industry?
