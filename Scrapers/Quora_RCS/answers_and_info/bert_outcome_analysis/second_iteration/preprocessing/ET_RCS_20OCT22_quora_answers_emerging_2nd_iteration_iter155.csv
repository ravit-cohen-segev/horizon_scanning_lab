1,"Bitcoin mining is a great way to earn cryptocurrency while providing a valuable service to the global network of users.

Miners can set up a hardware operation by themselves or join forces with a large venture via cloud mining. If you are looking to enter this field in 2020, here is what you need to know about the business.What Does It Take to Mine Bitcoin in 2020Bitcoin mining is a transaction security and validation service done via distributed computer systems each racing to solve complex mathematical problems before the competition.Miners Keep the global ledger consistent and immutable by repeatedly adding newly requested transactions into a block, which is then broadcast to the network and verified. For providing their valuable hashing power to the cryptocurrency network, miners are rewarded each time a new block is created by them in this fashion.Anyone thinking about entering this line of work needs to know that long gone are the days where one could just mine bitcoin with a desktop PC or even an old laptop. These days, any profitable bitcoin mining is done via computer systems tailored exclusively for the task, professionally called application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) miners. The most popular bitcoin mining machines are the Antminer series from Bitmain, but there are additional hardware offerings from companies such as Microbt, Canaan, Ebang and a few others. Take note that while some machines are available to be purchased off shelf already, or even immediately as second hand goods in online markets, when the newer models come out there is often a waiting period until they are shipped, and you need to take that into consideration.Other than the upfront cost of the hardware, your main expense as a miner is electricity. The power is primarily for operation of the computer systems themselves, but also for ventilation and air conditioning systems that might be needed depending on the situation. This is why professional miners routinely migrate around the world to locations that can offer them an optimal combinationof lower electricity prices and hospitable weather.Once the hardware is all set up, you then need to direct your mining machines to a mining pool such as F2pool, Pooling and Antpool. These are groupings of miners that compete to get a block together and share the rewards according to the contributed hashing power, thus spreading the work and streamlining the revenue for each one.How to Start Cloud Mining With BitcoinAn easier alternative to setting up your own mining operation is to go for cloud mining. This is a way to generate cryptocurrency that doesn’t require buying any expensive equipment, or installing the infrastructure needed for it. All you have to do is find a provider that you trust and buy a contract from them, which is in essence renting hash power in a dedicated facility. Zippercoin is one of such provider, with a cloud mining service focused on bitcoin cash(BCH) and BTC.Goodluck…",2 followers,Kelly Pearson,1K,0,0,https://www.quora.com/Is-small-scale-cryptocurrency-mining-dead

3,"If you compare with investing in Bitcoin buying with Bitcoin Mining. Then Bitcoin Mining is more profitable. Bitcoin mining is the process of solving complex computations to verify blocks or bitcoin transactions and registering them on a public ledger, Blockchain. In theory, it is a relatively simple process in which you require a robust ASIC miner (Application-specific integrated circuit), smart mining software, and pool, and you are good to go. However, in reality, the process is a little more complicated than that.Bitcoin mining is much more competitive now than it was a few years ago.If you compare with investing in Bitcoin buying with Bitcoin Mining.

However, in reality, the process is a little more complicated than that.Bitcoin mining is much more competitive now than it was a few years ago.However, you can earn more Bitcoins at less price with a bit of time using Bitcoin mining by following some general tricks.While large-scale enterprises have the resources to fund the initial investment and set up large bitcoin mining farms, small businesses do not. Regardless of the size of investments, businesses of every scale can make a profit. While the size of revenue will undoubtedly vary, the opportunities and the profit percentage can remain the same.For instance, setting up a large farm will require more hardware, software, resources, and power, increasing the initial investment. On the other hand, if a small-scale business sets up to resort to marketplaces like #Zionodes for getting a handful of machines, the initial costs, power consumption, maintenance, and additional miscellaneous charges will also reduce.So, bitcoin mining is still profitable for large-scale and small-scale businesses if done correctly. Also, by making some intelligent choices for the initial investments, you can further increase the profits and slowly and gradually leverage these profits to expand your business.The four main aspects that determine the profitability of any bitcoin mining operations are:But in reality, not everyone can mine Bitcoin as they expect. In that case, you can take a look at new projects with low price, but with great potential with clear, transparent background information. That's how I invest and find it quite effective, but it requires a lot of research. I recently learned about a project called F11, which has native token $F11 that is launched on Uniswap as an ERC20 token on the Ethereum network. This app strives to improve your everyday football experience by providing live results, in-app games, the F11 Champions League, and fan participation through NFTs.

More the capital investment the more will be the growth of a country.Four Priorities of Budget 2022PM GatiShaktiIt is driven by seven engines: Roads, Railways, Airports, Ports, Mass Transport, Waterways, and Logistics Infrastructure.It is also about formulation of Master Plan for expressways. Completing 25000 km national highways in 2022-23which if succeeded will be a great help to India but if you’ve been tracking the budget since 2015 Government has also promised Bullet Trains, Everyone’s gonna have a house of their own till 2022 and what not.So Government often use such fancy terms in their Budget but if atleast half of it is expected. Till then let’s hope for the best.Agriculture & Food ProcessingWell Again it’s a good initiative in educating farmers and reducing their efforts through High-Tech Services.EducationIn this Budget Government has really come up with a plan to educate the students who were left abundant due to covid & it has really hampered their growth.In this Budget Government has introducedGovernment has proposed to introduce upto 200 dedicated TV Channels for each Standard and in different languages in which students can get glued to & educate themselves.It will not be limited to only schools & colleges but also be conducting various skill enhancement programmes, Virtual Labs and many more.High quality e-content will be delivered through Digital TeachersA Digital University will be established with world class quality universal education.All Inclusive Welfare FocusThere’s an old saying in Post Offices10 baje aao toh office band11 baje aao toh Breakfast Hour1 baje aao toh Lunch Hour2 baje aao toh Office band hogya.4. Issuance of chip embedded E-Passports : Speaking honestly making my passport wasn’t really tough for me I got my passport within 7 days that too without tatkaal and I really like the physical passport but still its okay to have it electonically like Aadhar & Pan Cards.5. Providing a battery swapping policy as an alternative to setting up charging stations in urban areas : It can beTax ProposalsThis is the most talked about area & many rumours have also been heard that the basic exemption limit (upto which no income will be taxed) of ₹2,50,000 will be increased but there’s no room for middle class people in this Budget.Instead Government has found some new areas of interest.For Example : If I buy BTC of ₹100 & sell it on ₹130, the income of ₹30 will be taxed at a flat rate of 30% i.e ₹9 which I consider is lottery rate because 30% is a rate of tax which is levied on Lotteries, Betting on Race Horses & all sorts of Gambling.Therefore clearly Government is not trying promote the exchange in Crypto.Also Government has put the definition of VDA very wide & open for further inclusion which includes:&Set-off of LossesSet-off is basically deducting your loss from the profit of other head. Suppose you’ve earned a profit of ₹10,00,000 from sale of a Flat in a year & also incurred a loss of ₹1,00,000 in Business therefore you can set-off your business loss from Capital Gains.In simple words, if there is a loss on the transfer of a virtual digital asset, it will be a dead loss and it cannot be used to reduce or set off from any other income.Tax Deducted at Source (TDS)On transfer of VDA payer needs to deduct TDS at a rate of 1%For Example : If you buy BTC of ₹200 & sell at ₹300, TDS will be deducted on the transfer value of ₹300 & you’ll only get ₹297 by selling but the tax of 30% will be levied on ₹100.Claim of Input Tax Credit (ITC)Earlier if a person purchased something & paid GST on it he could claim input on that GST even if the supplier hasn’t uploaded the invoice.Later it became 10% of the uploaded invoice or un-uploaded whichever is lower.Then it became 5% of the uploaded invoice or un-uploaded whichever is lower.& now if the supplier hasn’t uploaded you cannot claim ITC on it.ConclusionAll in All I prefer it is an economy boosting budget focusing the crucial areas of help and need people expect from Government. Considering the election the Government might have introduced a boasting & popularizing Budget but they didn’t. Rather there’s nothing for Middle Class people in this Budget but they might come up with something next year, until then let’s see how this works.If You like my effort please do upvote, share it with your friends & family & follow me.So till thenThis is Saif AliSigning off.",26 followers,Balaji Viswanathan,7.8K,5.6K,426.3M,https://www.quora.com/Is-small-scale-cryptocurrency-mining-dead

It also doesn't help that cryptocurrency miners invest in more powerful and resource-dependent computer equipment to succeed compared to their peers.Move away from the proof-of-work validation methodProof of work is a validation method that prizes computing power and resource usage. As cryptocurrency miners' computer power goes up, so does their mining power. When people solve the mathematical challenges that allow them to validate blockchain transactions through proof of work, they get rewarded with more cryptocurrency. A much more reliable way is using proof of stake and proof of authorityThe proof-of-stake and proof-of-authority methods are significantly less energy-intensive than proof-of-work validation. If those building blockchain applications move toward less energy-intensive methods of verification, there should be a resultant decrease in blockchain energy consumption.Focus on sustainable ways to mine bitcoinAs mentioned earlier, the computing setups used by cryptocurrency miners are primarily responsible for the exceptionally high energy demands of the blockchain. Fortunately, efforts are underway, such as an initiative by Cryptosolartech in Spain, to mine bitcoins with solar or wind energy.Imagine If everyone involved in bitcoin mining should mine individually… Imagine each person involved in bitcoin mining having his/her warehouses for housing bitcoin mining devices and equipment… Another way to minimize is by mining pool and cloud mining. By buying contracts with companies that are into bitcoin and crypto mining, one reduces having to purchase mining devices Individually.

Some of the fastest-growing sectors include cloud computing, e-commerce, financial technology, and healthcare.The technology sector in particular is attractive as a growth industry. Technology innovations drive progress in essentially every other industry, and tech's dominance has only been accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic.Investing inAs for specific stock picks,Stocks such as these may not be the”cheapest” stocks available, but they trade at premiums for good reason. Each of these companies is steadily increasing both revenue and profitability and plays a core role in the modern economy.Since investing in high-growth businesses can greatly increase your portfolio's2. Buy dividend stocks.Investing inThe best dividend-paying companies are those that steadily increase the dividends paid over time. A company that consistently raises its dividend is usually a growing company. To evaluate which companies are best positioned to raise their dividends, consider the free cash out of the company in question.A company with an increasing stock price and dividend can generate significant investment returns over long time horizons. The key is toWhen selecting dividend stocks, don't simply invest in the stocks with the highest dividend yields . An above-average dividend is often a indicator that there's something wrong with the company.3. Invest in ETFs.Buying shares in exchange-traded funds (ETFs) is a great option for investors who don't want to choose individual stocks. These passively managed funds track the performance of certain indexes, have low expense ratio, and can provide exposure to entire asset classes. ETFs, which confer instant portfolio diversification, are also well-suited for taxable investment accounts since their holdings change infrequently.An ETF may be indexed to the S P 500 (SNPINDEX), such as theMany ETFs are focused on specific industries, such as the4. Buy bonds and bond ETFs.You can also addA bond is a loan to a business or organization. Bondholders are entitled to collect interest payments during the bond's term and receive the bond's face value in a lump-sum payment at the end of the period. Although bonds are generally less risky than stocks, they also generate lower returns over the long term. The bonds with the highest yields are known as junk bonds and are issued by companies that are less financially stable than their peers.Another consideration when investing in bonds is that the interest payments from bonds can be taxed as income if you are using a taxable brokerage account. Exceptions include most municipal bonds which are bonds issued by local governments.Most bonds can only be purchased in $1,000 or $5,000 increments, which can make it difficult to diversify your bond holdings. For this reason, many investors instead opt to put their money in bond ETFs since they are more affordable and already diversified.5. Invest in REITs.While buying real estate is another great way to diversify your investment portfolio, owning property is not cheap. Even owning a few properties would not result in a diversified portfolio. For that reason, many investors may prefer to buy shares in real estate investment trusts (REITs).REITs are professionally managed portfolios of properties. Most REITs are organized around a real estate theme such as shopping malls or data centers. Because REITs are required to disburse to shareholders at least 90% of their taxable income, which is generated by rent and interest payments, REITs often pay higher dividends than most stocks. Their share prices can also appreciate in value as the price of real estate rises.Shares of REITs trade on stock exchanges just like shares of any public company. REITs can be especially appealing to income-focused investors, but it's important to realize that REIT payouts are typically taxed as ordinary income in taxable brokerage accounts.Remember to diversify your portfolioRegardless of how you choose to invest your $100,000, establishing a diversified portofolio is key to achieving your financial goals. No single company or investment should have an outsized place in your portfolio. Diversifying eliminates the risk of your portfolio's value changing dramatically if one company encounters misfortune. A diversified portfolio is also more likely to generate relatively consistent returns from year to year.A good range for how many stocks to own is 15 to 20. You can keep adding to your holdings and also invest in other types of assets such as bonds, REITs, and ETFs. The key is to conduct the necessary research on each investment to make sure you know what you are buying and why.Invest to minimize taxes and feesWhen putting your $100,000 to work, take care to minimize taxes and fees. Over long periods of time, expenses on your investments can significantly reduce your returns since every dollar subtracted from your portfolio is a dollar that is no longer earning compound interest.Consider using a tax-advantaged retirement account. Individual retirement accounts (IRAs), including traditional IRAs and Roth Iras, confer valuable tax savings. Contributions to traditional IRAs are often deductible from your tax bill, and withdrawals in retirement — when you may be in a lower tax bracket are taxed as ordinary income. Contributions to Roth IRAs are made with after-tax dollars, and withdrawals in retirement are tax-free.Other tax-advantaged options include 401 (k)Regardless of the type of retirement account, the earnings accumulated in the account are tax-deferred. And, in a taxable investment account, you are not obligated to pay taxes on gains until you sell the security (All investments bear some sort of expense. Be on the lookout for hidden fees, especially if you invest in annuities offered by insurance companies orA recap on how to invest $100,0001. Pay off high-interest debt.2. Establish an emergency fund.3. Begin your investing journey.Your specific investment goals and risk appetite predominantly determine how you should invest your money. Risk-averse investors or those nearing retirement may choose to invest more conservatively, while risk-seekers or younger investors may opt to buy mostly stocks.Once you establish your portfolio, remember to stay focused on your investment goals and the reasons why you invested in each security. Market volatility is inevitable, but that matters little if your original investment thesis remains unchanged.
