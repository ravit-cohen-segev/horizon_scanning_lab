The #sena token is a governance token that entitles its holders to a share of the profit of the company and to take certain decision-making rights pertaining to the direction of the organization. Did I research that it’s from an experienced construction company with headquarters in Indonesia. With blockchain technology applied, #sena is a very potential project for you to invest in. The price now is still reasonable but it undoubtedly will grow exponentially soon.

The most reliable approach is to buy a cryptocurrency for the long term and increase your own profit thanks to the interest rate.How does it work?First of all, you purchase crypto such as BTC, ETH, etc. Then you open an account with a company that uses your crypto to make more crypto – essentially the same way banks make money on the money you deposit with them and miners make money on Proof of Work blockchains. This option is preferable, just like any case scenario where you hand over your money to professionals.Which platforms to choose from?Companies like BlockFi or Coinbase allow you to use their platform to deposit crypto and get rewarded (they do the heavy lifting and charge a usually small percentage so everyone benefits). There are lots of platforms like that. For example, Midas.Investments provides 45 different cryptocurrencies for you to invest in. The interest return rates vary depending on the currency you’re investing in. Rates range from 5% for the lowest-performing to 17-22% for the popular coins.Cryptocurrency savings accounts provide an opportunity to earn interest rates far above the current offer for traditional cash savings accounts.

All you need to do is simply start accepting bitcoin as payment and to request people you pay to accept bitcoin.In practical terms, bitcoin will have to be much, much simpler to use for people too, and we believe the work on user solutions like our simple Bitamp wallet solution for easy use on the go, will support this effort. Once people find using bitcoin as easy as using a card payment or cash, they won’t even think twice.The next step for “mass adoption” then would be to make bitcoin accessible to all — the majority of people, because of lack of education, access and technology, simply can’t use bitcoin, even if they wanted to. So the world needs to fix these society problems first, before they can seek decentralization of monetary systems.","1,404 followers",Joe Cartel,564,0,0,https://www.quora.com/How-you-would-become-cryptocurrency-millionaire
