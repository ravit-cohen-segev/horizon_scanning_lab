Better information would have probably prevented Chernobyl, but information was not allowed to flow freely even among those who really needed to know, in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. Better information probably would not have prevented Fukushima unless it were acted on at great cost so that the resulting construction was completed before March 11, 2011. Anyway, show us how these presumably information tools would have have helped to prevent these two major nuclear reactor accidents.",1 follower,David McFarland,1.3K,2.1K,6M,https://www.quora.com/Is-it-possible-to-use-an-A-I-or-Internet-of-Things-to-prevent-a-nuclear-disaster-just-like-in-Chernobyl-Fukushima

Human error has been part of the problems so new training and procedures have been added. Still, nuclear power remains one of the safest and cleanest forms of energy available.But current Pressurised Water Reactors, PWRs, remain inefficient, expensive, slow to build and complex to operate.Next Generation Reactors, Generation 4, are currently being developed. These reactors are highly resistant or immune to meltdowns. Mainly by using inbuilt features that can work automatically with the need for human intervention. No AI or internet needed but they could be added. The next step in Generation 4 reactors is the need to build prototypes to prove their safety and capabilities.China has just started operation of a new gas-cooled pebble bed reactor the uses heat resistant spheres that contain fuel. Able to operate at much higher temperatures without melting. And air cooling systems that do not need power or pumps to keep the temperatures down. This system does not need to be shut down for refueling. The fuel spheres are regularly removed, tested, returned or replaced. They will have a much longer lifespan than fuel rods so they will be able to burn fuel more efficiently producing much less waste.China is also building an MSR, Molten Salt Reactor, reactor and possible a Sodium Cooled Traveling Wave Reactor. The MSR system is highly efficient and burns up most of the nuclear material leaving very little waste. It has the fuel mixed with the salt and it can be quickly removed at any time from the reactor to a safe cooling tank. This will be done automatically if needed without human intervention and no need for power or pumps. Some of the fuel mix can regularly be removed or placed into the reactor with any shutdown. The liquid mix allows for easy refueling or removal of valuable and useful nuclear products. For materials used in science, industry, space or medical uses.The Sodium colled Travelling Wave Reactor, TWR, uses a slow-burning fuel system that lasts for years. It uses depleted Uranium waste for fuel that is abundant and cheap and held in large stockpiles so no mining would be needed. The depleted Uranium comes from the Uranium enrichment commonly used in PWR reactors. This system is mostly self managing and is very easy to operate.Many of these reactors can be small or modular. So they can be easily transported to where they are needed. They could be built in factories for efficient and cheaper production and rapid construction. They are easier to operate with less staff. They can use nuclear and mining waste as fuel and even burn up nuclear weapons-grade material reducing proliferation risks.Efficient burning of the fuel produces much less waste and leaves less material for weapons use. The MSRs can use Thorium as fuel which is a byproduct of rare earth mining. Making it very cheap. It is also easy to handle and does not need expensive or dirty enrichment. Thorium is 3 times more abundant than Uranium and all of it can be used as fuel.The ideal solution for nuclear energy is Fusion. As used in the sun. But it may take decades A Chinesetest reactor has produced plasma at 2 times the heat of the sun for 100 seconds. A world record. The very large international ITER reactor being build in France may be operational by 2025. But these costs over $10 billion so actual power-producing fusion reactors may be far too expensive. If at all possible. But the safety risks would be minimal with no long term nuclear waste. And the fuel can be produced for free from water.So for vital low carbon energy Generation 4 fission reactors remain a faster option for cheap, low carbon energy. The efficiency of Gen 4 reactors could compete with gas. Having no risk of meltdowns, steam explosions or hydrogen explosions these reactors could use very much cheaper and smaller containment buildings. Or could be placed underground for security.These reactors are in development in many countries but lack support. So China has been able to take the lead in development. Some reactors using US research and technology. US production of prototypes has not yet started but they are gaining vital political support. The US-built successful MSR prototypes in the past but the programs canceled for political reasons. Along with anti-nuclear activists, there are strong oil, gas and coal lobby groups with long, historic connections and rich backers.There are some very good reasons to develop Gen 4 prototype reactors. Despite all the arguments by anti-nuclear groups that oppose all nuclear power. Many new nuclear reactors are already planned for future construction in a number of countries. This can not be stopped by anti-nuclear groups. But better and safer reactors with low carbon power would be a better option. China and India alone are planning to build over 50 nuclear reactors. They are building many different types of reactors so they can decide and use whichever are best.Other arguments are that they cost too much to develop and take to long to be of any use. Both of these arguments fail to recognize the need for low carbon energy options and the resources we have to develop and build these reactors. Solar and wind power will not replace fossil fuels within the next 20 years. And with the costs of global warming, the cost of developing Gen 4 nuclear is cheap. A number of prototype reactors could be built for less than the cost of an aircraft carrier. Production reactors would be much cheaper than current PWR reactorsCheap in terms of military spending as well. And global warming will be a significant global security risk. If global warming theories prove to be accurate. Either way, Gen 4 technology can be timely, at reasonable cost and effective. Most of the technology exists, the industrial capacity exists, the reactors will be cheaper and faster to build. And they will cut down on other pollution problems. Including reduction of high-grade nuclear waste. Production reactors could be ready in 10 years. And the costs of Gen 4 power will be competitive with coal and gas.They are building US, Russian, European and Canadian reactors as well as indigenous ones. Gen 4 reactors will be an option if the prototypes are built, tested and their capabilities proven. Generation 4 reactors will also be needed to replace older reactors that are reaching the end of their economic lives.Currently, there are many Gen 4 designs that could be built as prototypes before production power reactors can be built. In the US it is very hard to build Gen 4 reactor prototypes without significant government support. Many small US companies are developing the technologies. Fusion technology also. It would be nice to see other countries building prototypes.AI can play a role in future but the current need is for production of prototype Gen 4 reactors to provide safer, cleaner and cheaper nuclear power.","220,153 followers",Franklin Veaux,625,47.3K,779.4M,https://www.quora.com/Is-it-possible-to-use-an-A-I-or-Internet-of-Things-to-prevent-a-nuclear-disaster-just-like-in-Chernobyl-Fukushima

In most commonly know methods many times during the fusion process besides the fast moving neutrons that it loses, the flow of plasma isn't always the same. Some times the plasma takes on some erratic shapes that simply force the reactor to stop.So bottom line is this…We still don't have the right kind of fuel that does not produce fast moving neutrons. I mean, we do know of a fuel but seeing there's almost none here on Earth but tons of it on the Moon, it is still cost prohibitive to do such an endeavor. At least until oil runs out and then we'll really have to get a move on.As for the inconsistencies in the plasma flow. That's been gradually been fixed thanks to the data we have already collected and the information obtained by simulations run on supercomputers.So the real problem seems to be fuel.Or maybe… There is actually no problem at all.Here… Let me present to you. Jetter Cycle Fusion! It will be a bit long so bear with me.So what is the Jetter cycle…Adding lithium 6 to an electrostatic confinement fusor that contains deuterium should result in a more practical system of energy production. Though none have been reported as yet.Li-6 is easily separated from Li-7. If you have a Lithium mine you could sell the Lithium 7 and keep the Lithium 6.Then manufacture a Farnsworth Hirsch fusor with a Lithium Tungsten lining.Since selling enriched Lithium is illegal you sell the power and keep the hardware. Or better yet use the power to make fuel and sell that.If you could make lots of cheap fission free hydrogen bombs out of Lithium 6 and deuterium say 0.33 kilotons each. That's 1.395 trillion joules. And detonated them off in a nozzle that directed the plasma plume we’d have a rocket! Put two rockets pointing in opposite directions blowing up bombs 1/60 th of a second apart each operating at precisely 30x per second and let the plasma stream flow through a MHD generator for each exhaust plume and switch the two generators we would have a 60 Hz AC generator producing 83.68 terawatts of power!Humanity today uses only 17 terawatts of power burning stuff that died long time ago. So the generator just described provides 5x the power of the whole planet. Since each watt allows people to create $6 per year of income done cheaply this generator ends air pollution and generates enough power to support a $502 trillion per year economy. $68,000 per person per year. A family of four earns $272,000 per year.Monaco levels of Wealth! At 16,000 people per km2 the same as Monaco very little of the Earth is used. 100% recycling by mixing in garbage around the bomblet and separating out various elements from the plume with magnetic deflection.Now at 270.1 trillion joules per kilogram of Lithium 6 deuteride we need only 5.16 grams per bomblet. At 0.6 kg/l this occupies 8.6 ml. About the size of two teaspoons.Shot out of a Gatling gun into the nozzle at 30 times per second each phased a 60th of a second apart. The two guns are synchronised and each charge has a detonator that senses the magnetic field of the power circuit to get the timing just right.This that I have described to you is all technology developed in the 50’s.At $0.03 per kWh and 1.395 terajoules per unit you could spend over $12,430 per bomblet and spend less for energy than you do for coal.At 60 detonations per second the generator uses 310 grams per second to power the generator imagined. 232 grams per second of Li6 and 78 grams/sec Deuterium!Deuterium is extracted by processing 2.23 litres per second of sea water and isotopically separating 3.06 kg per second of naturally occurring Lithium metal.That's 70.67 million litres of sea water per year and 96,700 tons of raw Lithium per year. 16% of today's 600,000 ton per year production.University of Michigan and Ford estimated that we know of 39 million tons of Lithium can be recovered. Enough to operate this generator for 403 years.The Lithium content of sea water is 230 billion tons. Enough to power the generator for 2.38 million years! This requires 15.3 million litres of sea water be processed each second. 0.5 TW is needed to desalinate this much water. A fraction of the power available. So we are good to go!This also produces 67,000 litres per year of fresh water from sea water per person. A fraction of the 3 tons of garbage per person.We start with known Lithium supplies and build out seawater based systems as we go.Treated as revenue sources the power could be secondary to the value of the raw materials produced by such an engine!Reducing bomblets from Hiroshima sized blasts well below Davey Crockett sized blasts of 30 ton equivalent though our bomblets are far smaller (0.8 ml) and far cleaner, (no fissile materials) lets us build 10 floating generators spaced around the planet each 8.368 TW in size. Each near a populous port city.With all revenue streams producing $0.11 per kWh for energy waste processing fresh water raw materials etc the generator owners earn 16% of the $6 per year per watt they create. Of the $50 trillion per year in wealth they create they collect $8 trillion per year!!The cost of the power plant is less than the cost of a conventional nuclear plant or off shore drilling platform. $10 billion tops!","3,657 followers",Brent Oster,3.6K,357,1.8M,https://www.quora.com/Is-it-possible-to-use-an-A-I-or-Internet-of-Things-to-prevent-a-nuclear-disaster-just-like-in-Chernobyl-Fukushima

It is remarkable that we (as a species) are even attempting it and more remarkable that we may well succeed.People seem to think that fusion is relatively easy, but it really isn’t. Even in the core of the sun, fusion generates only a small amount of net heat. A cubic metre of the sun’s fusing core only generates around 275 watts. That’s less energy output than we give off as body heat for an equivalent volume. The reason why the sun is so hot is because there are hundreds of thousands of miles of insulation (in the form of hot gas contained by gravity) around this heating centre.There’s a reason stars burn for billions of years, they really only burn slowly.Now consider the conditions at the core of the sun - 250 billion atmospheres, 15 million degrees (K or C doesn’t matter at this scale). And that is sufficient to make a piddly amount of heat per cubic metre. Scaled down to operations that would fit on Earth, that’s not going to cut it for power generation. You’d get more power out of a single large solar panel in good conditions. (That might seem odd but consider the sheer size of the sun, even “just” the core region).What’s more, we can’t achieve those sorts of pressures so we need much higher temperatures before we even start fusion; closer to 100 million degrees. We then need to surround this heating zone with the kind of insulation a few hundred thousand miles worth of mind-bogglingly dense gas and plasma provides (using superpowered magnets), and then we have to extract sensible energy without causing the whole reaction to stall and still end up with enough energy to outweigh the inevitable energy losses.I hope this gives you an idea of what an achievement creating a working fusion power plant will be.

My former father-in-law also worked at Lawrence Berkeley Labs, and was an engineer designing superconducting coil magnets and had decades of experience working with fusion researchers, even though his primary application was particle accelerators. From having many long conversations with these very intelligent and qualified people I realized that thereI used to work on fusion simulation codes (particle in cell) with the US National Labs when I was at NVIDIA, and I was very interested in seeing if we could solve the problems with fusion and picked the scientist and engineers' brains endlessly. My former father-in-law also worked at Lawrence Berkeley Labs, and was an engineer designing superconducting coil magnets and had decades of experience working with fusion researchers, even though his primary application was particle accelerators. From having many long conversations with these very intelligent and qualified people I realized that there are some really hard problems that block practical fusion, with no immediate solutions in sight.The only place we know of working, large-scale, energy-generating fusion reactions is at the center of a star, where the gravity of the massive star creates the necessary density, temperature, and time being held in that state at the core for fusion reactions to run continuously. This is called the Lawson criteria, and is hard to achieve. All of the layers of the star above that act as an energy exchanger, converting all the gamma rays and fast neutrons at the core into progressively less energetic wavelengths of light and motion of nuclei (heat) so by the time they reach the surface of the star, that energy is emitted as IR and visible light that heats and powers our planet's biosphere, and can provide photovoltaic energy to us as well. All of our efforts in fusion have been to try and reproduce this process on earth, in a small reactor that can provide practical energy.First I will talk aboutThe first problem with magnetic confinement is fundamental - no matter how strong or well formed the magnetic field containing the plasma is, it will always leak, as positive nuclei or ions spiralling around the magnetic field lines collide and scatter, eventually drifting out of the containment field. The only known solution is to make the reactor larger so the scattering ions take longer to travel to the plasma boundary, and thus more fusion can happen during that time. Pretty brute force.The world's most advanced magnetic confinement fusion power plant is ITER, which, to reduce the ion scattering problem mentioned above, is 6-stories tall and about the same dimension in diameter, containing the mass of 3 Eiffel towers, and it is still not expected to be large enough to contain a plasma long enough to sustain burning and produce continuous energy generation.A more practical problem is how do we extract the energy? Most of the energy in deuterium-tritium fusion reactions is released in fast, high-energy neutrons, which (because they are neutral, and have no electric charge) are not confined by the magnetic field, don't heat up the plasma, and have to be stopped by a thick shield, which then heats up, and can vaporize water to steam in order to power turbines and electrical generators. The problem is the constant bombardment by neutrons makes the shield material degrade with time, and become very radioactive, posing a problem for removal and disposal.Also, deuterium-tritium fusion reactions are currently used because they take place at the lowest energies and at the lowest plasma temperatures of all the possible fusion fuels, and thus are easier to ignite and keep lit. However, tritium is not found naturally in any significant quantities and needs to be manufactured in nuclear reactors. With today's production capacity, we just cannot make enough tritium to power even ITER continuously. We could use better fuels, like Helium-3 or Boron-11, which do not emit neutrons and thus 'burn clean', but the plasma temperature must be much higher and the confinement much better to ignite fusion and sustain it with these fuels. And while Boron-11 is plentiful, Helium-3 is so rare that scientists think that the best source of it is lunar regolith that has been irradiated for billions of years on the moon's surface. Any energy generation infrastructure that requires a regular supply of a moon-based fuel, even as energy dense as He3, will probably never work out.A proposed solution to the Tritium deficit is to construct the shield surrounding the reactor with lithium, which is abundant, and fissions into tritium when struck by neutrons, thereby 'breeding' tritium within the reactor itself. Of course, this comes with its own set of problems of how to capture, purify, and contain the tritium after it is released into the tokamak reaction chamber from the walls.Another issue is that when all of the superconducting magnets in ITER are running at full current (160,000 amps) to create the 13 Tesla toroidal magnetic field (13x that in an MRI machine) and to create the other plasma-shaping and heating fields, they are storing 60 GigaJoules, or around 12 Tons of TNT worth of energy. This is because the 180 kilometers of superconducting Niobium-Tin wires in all these massive magnet coils can carry enormous electrical current when supercooled with liquid helium.More info on the ITER magnets:But, if that cooling fails, the superconductor heats up, quenches, and becomes a normal conductor, and can no longer carry that enormous current. With 160,000 amps suddenly meeting resistance, the coil rapidly vaporizes, and causes a meltdown of the other coils, with a total energy release of 12 tons of TNT. This is very undesirable, especially when those coils are wrapped around a highly radioactive shield that also vaporizes and is expelled into the atmosphere. There are fault-detection systems, but it takes a while to dissipate that amount of energy safely, and there may not be enough time to react quickly enough in the event of a catastrophic magnet coil failure.So, some gotchas left to solve for practical fusion energy generation with magnetic confinement, with some perhaps not so easily solved.Inertial confinement fusionIt also has many of the same problems with energy conversion to electricity, and much worse wear and tear on the shielding from these small nuclear fusion explosions being set off, which also trashes all the precision equipment needed to hold the fuel pellet in the focus of the converging laser beams with extreme accuracy. So, a lot of practical damage control problems before inertial confinement fusion is a practical source of energy generation.While these problems may be solved, practical application is still a very long way off, and currently the main application of inertial confinement fusion is as an experimental testbed for calibrating computer codes used to simulate and design thermonuclear fusion weapons. As horrific as these weapons may be, the simulation codes developed for designing them (sorry maintaining them), are the one of the greatest tools for innovation in fusion energy. There is a hydrodynamics code which simulates the behavior of the fissile (and fusion) materials under extreme conditions of pressure and temperature, as well as transport codes that model neutron transport and scattering in the materials under these conditions, and many other bits and bobs. They are all standard numerical techniques, and the really classified part is the integration and calibration of all these codes with previous nuclear weapon tests from the past, and with these small scale simulations in the present.Electrostatic Confinement FusionBasically you need a vacuum container the size of a basketball and a pump to empty it. You put a small spherical wire cage the size of a golf ball in the center, and a larger wire cage the size of a bowling ball around it. You then pump out all the air, and apply a very large (10,000V) electrical potential between the two cages, with the small negative cathode at the center, and the positive anode at the periphery.Then you open a valve and let in a very small amount of Deuterium gas (commercially available) into the vacuum chamber, and it ionizes in the large voltage potential, the D+ ions in the periphery experience a very strong electric field (100K V/m), and are rapidly accelerated towards the center of the reactor, with enough energy to collide and fuse the deuterium nuclei (no tritium required). This fusion can be measured with an external neutron counter.Theoretically, power generation would be simple, as the fusion products consisting of highly energetic He3 and (few) H3 ions could be decelerated in an electric field and the current from that used to generate electricity directly.Here is ECG Herman’s excellent thesis paper on designing and constructing a Farnsworth Fusor:Although they seem like a obvious winners due to their simplicity and effectiveness, ECF reactors have several things limiting scaling:a) There is a limit to the deuterium gas density before performance degrades, so generation capacity is limited.b) Deuterium ions tend to collide with the wire cage cathode in the center, which absorbs them, heating the cage, and causing energy loss and contamination from metal atoms being dislodged.c) As the deuterium ions oscillate back and forth through the center, each time they change direction, they emit bremsstrahlung radiation, or photons of light, losing energy (this is how your dentist’s x-ray machine works).d) Scattering tends to reduce the nice, radial trajectories of the ions into a Maxwellian distribution over time, reducing the fusion that occurs.There has been work in using electromagnets at the periphery to try and hold a ball of electrons in the center, eliminating the need for a central cage… akaThermonuclear WeaponsIn the Teller-Ulam, two-stage, thermonuclear weapon, a spherical plutonium fission primary (with deuterium-tritium fusion fuel at the core to boost it) is imploded by conventional explosives, the plutonium is crushed far beyond critical density, fissions and detonates. The initial radiation released is contained and focused onto the fusion secondary to implode it, ignite fusion, and detonate it. I just mention this to illustrate the enormous energy needed to really reach the Lawson criteria in a large scale, but nuclear weapons kind of freak me out, so I'm going to refer you to the link to the Wikipedia article about them if you want to read more:Thermonuclear weapon - WikipediaSo, in summary, we should not shut down or stop building today's fission nuclear reactors, as commercial fusion reactors are not only far in the future, but also produce radioactive waste (their shielding, which needs to be periodically replaced), and Tokamaks can melt down catastrophically and explode if there is a cooling failure in the magnet coils during full power operation. They also do not run on seawater, like some say. We need expensive and difficult to produce tritium (which is also radioactive) to ignite fusion at the temperatures and densities that today's tokamak magnetic fields can produce.To advance fusion energy in your career, I think the best fields to study would be physics (classical, electrodynamics, plasma, quantum, nuclear…) and computer science, with a focus on numerical simulation. The actual physical fusion reactors are so expensive and time-consuming to build, test, and operate, that you may only get to iterate designs once or twice in a career, but computer simulations can take us in so many different directions more cheaply and easily by comparison.Perhaps there is some exotic stellarator magnetic confinement design, or advanced Farnsworth electrostatic confinement design that has not been explored in depth, that will turn out to hold the key to fusion energy. Simulation is probably the best first step to find it, unless you have a few billion dollars and several hundred kilometers of Niobium-Tin wire and helium cooling tubing to play with.Brent",2 followers,Richard Muller,1.7K,2.3K,201.9M,https://www.quora.com/Whats-our-current-progress-on-nuclear-fusion-power-and-what-problems-remain

Billions of dollars of funding have been made available over the decades since the mid-1950s for a variety of Magnetic Confinement Fusion experiments (tokamaks, stellarators, mirror machines, etc.). Sadly, there has been frustratingly little payoff for all this MCF pure fusion effort as never once in over six decades of effort has any MCF fusion experiment produced any net energy from fusion (even for micro-seconds).MCF fusion researchers and advocates promise (but do not actually deliver) smooth controlled release of MCF fusion power.ICF fusion worked and produced net energy from fusion from the very first experimental ICF fusion test (Ivy-Mike 1952).Practical Inertial Confinement Fusion produces power in a regular series of short controlled fusion bursts. This “pulse mode” of practical ICF power generation, and the military origins of the underlying technology, tends to scare the public and the public’s elected representatives in government who do not vote equivalent funding for practical ICF fusion, even though practical ICF fusion is the only form of fusion that has generated any net energy from fusion in over 60 long years of fusion experimentation.Inertial confinement fusion is the only form of fusion that has to date been proven to work in actual field experiments (not just in computer simulations). Cold war era Halite-Centurion series underground test shots (1977-1988) were fusion related add on shots piggy-backed onto DOE-DOD shots already on the underground test schedule. These shots were designed to utilize a small portion of the X-rays produced from the primary of an experimental device through a line of sight to ignite a remote fusion experiment housed remotely some distance away in the underground experimental test canister.Once classified Halite-Centurion pure fusion test shots experimentally proved that small DT filled spheres could be ignited and brought to full fusion ignition using an intense beam of X-rays. ICF fusion has beenIf the public was comfortable in producing fusion energy in a succession of short fusion “bursts” instead of in a smooth continuous fusion burn; providing funding and committing National Lab design resources in a way comparable to MCF research, we could have with very low technical risk reliable ICF fusion power plants in a time frame that matters (proof of principal within 5 years - commercial ICF power plants in 10 years).","220,153 followers",Franklin Veaux,5K,47.3K,779.4M,https://www.quora.com/Is-it-possible-to-use-an-A-I-or-Internet-of-Things-to-prevent-a-nuclear-disaster-just-like-in-Chernobyl-Fukushima

14,"Have humans ever created an energy-positive fusion reactor?Apart from bombs, which I’m assuming don’t count even though they are energy-positive?I believe a few reactors and experiments have very briefly produced more energy out than in, but none have done so in what you might call a “useful” fashion, where that energy could be exploited for power generation.","220,153 followers",Franklin Veaux,1.6K,47.3K,779.4M,https://www.quora.com/Is-it-possible-to-use-an-A-I-or-Internet-of-Things-to-prevent-a-nuclear-disaster-just-like-in-Chernobyl-Fukushima

17,"Is it not very interesting how the answers we are always given for energy involves very dangerous and expensive ideas? Why is this? The answer to that question is, anything that can produce free energy and would put the biggest energy monopolies in the history of the world out of business, will not be investigated very close to protect Big Oil.

18,"No, not if by “a reality” you mean putting enough electrical energy into the grid to keep significant amounts of coal or other fossil fuels in the ground, unused, and their combustion products out of the air.“Do you think Fusion Power Plants are a reality in our lifetime?”Of course, it would be fantastic to get clean energy from a nearly unlimited source that produces no radiation. However, not just any hydrogen atom will do. Deuterium (H2) is required. Deuterium is a couple orders of magnitude more abundant than Uranium or Thorium. That is still a long way from unlimited.Uranium 1.8 ppm atomsNo, not if by “a reality” you mean putting enough electrical energy into the grid to keep significant amounts of coal or other fossil fuels in the ground, unused, and their combustion products out of the air.“Do you think Fusion Power Plants are a reality in our lifetime?”Of course, it would be fantastic to get clean energy from a nearly unlimited source that produces no radiation.

19,"Yes. Mix U238 with pl238 or another easily shielded alpha emitter. Mix the alpha emitter with a low z material like beryllium boron or carbon. When alpha particles hit a low z material sometimes they knock out neutrons of sufficient energy to convert u238 to pl239, which fissions. Its not a chain reaction. Its a radioisotope neutron source which subcritically fissions plutonium by slowly breeding uranium. So its partly decay heat partly fission heat. Nasa has though of this exact setup to get 10 times more power from theit typical plutonium 238 rtg. RTGs are an absolute trash technology. TheyYes.

In a home setting youll probably use a heat engine with a working fluid. Steam, stirling, or closed loop brayton and buried about 20 feet underground with a tube connecting to the heat engine above ground to vent the waste heat. The fuel will need to be swapped out every now and then but itll last a lot awhile. About 1.5 to kilowatts electric for continuous production is more then the average american household uses. Thats 36 kwh per day and most US homes use about 30 kilowatts. With a battery pack youll have 24/7 electricity for years.Something like this can safely fit under the hood of a car with a few inches of lead maximum. It wont be any heavier then a diesel engine if its only purpose is to be a battery nuclear hybrid.",3 followers,Steve Baker,3.7K,27.3K,162.3M,https://www.quora.com/Is-it-possible-to-use-an-A-I-or-Internet-of-Things-to-prevent-a-nuclear-disaster-just-like-in-Chernobyl-Fukushima

So if the reactor produces 3 kW, the car would be limited to a 9mph top speed!However, if the car still had a decent battery pack, the nuclear reactor could recharge it overnight by about 90 miles in 10 hours - which is enough for most people’s commute.Failing that - fitting 10 bowling balls into the trunk of the car would get you a 90mph car without needing batteries…and the reactors would last longer than the car itself, so it would never need refueling or recharging.[[UPDATE]] :But it would take 7 tonnes of fuel rods (which are insanely radioactive) to get enough Americium for ONE of those reactors. The cost of one would run into the billions of dollars range.CONCLUSION:It’s completely implausible to do this in practice.","29,754 followers",Tomaž Vargazon,6.8K,7.6K,248.6M,https://www.quora.com/Is-it-possible-to-use-an-A-I-or-Internet-of-Things-to-prevent-a-nuclear-disaster-just-like-in-Chernobyl-Fukushima
