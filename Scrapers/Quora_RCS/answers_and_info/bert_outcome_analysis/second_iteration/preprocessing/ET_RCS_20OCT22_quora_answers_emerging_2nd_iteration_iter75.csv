Focus on the long-term. A long-term plan shouldn’t be affected by stocks rising or falling, by 20%.3. Diversify both in terms of time diversification, as it is safer as per the charts below, and asset diversification - not putting all your eggs in one basket.The last point is especially the case for middle-aged and older investors.4. Take advice where needed. This could be to do with tax, investing, or other issues.The more complicated your situation, the greater chance that advice will add some benefits.5. Don’t try to time the perfect time to buy assets, also known as market timing, which doesn’t work.And finally, they don’t stay in cash. Cash is a 100% guaranteed inflation loss.What’s more, this year, inflation is due to top 10% in the UK according to the Bank of England’s forecasts, with banks paying 1%. That is a 9% loss to inflation.If you buy assets, they will go up and down, but even if they go down, you don’t face a loss (only a decline) unless you sell out.Nobody “lost” money investing one day before the stock and real estate crash in 2007-2008, if they kept their nerve. Prices recovered within 3 years.In comparison, cash lost to inflation can never be recovered.Worried about the fall in the Pound or other currencies or inflation?

One of my classmates was sitting at his computer, nonchalantly moving this white toy in his hand. On closer look, I saw it was spinning. Immediately I recognized it as the spinny-thing I had seen in a YouTube video, a fidget spinner.

Not only was it oddly satisfying to just spin it on my hand or on the table, I found that if it's spinning on your thumb and index finger, and you twist your wrist side to side, you could feel the resistance in your wrist, because of the gyroscopic force of the spin.Anyways, after I realized how fun they were, I kind of forgot about it for a few days.Then I started seeing more.And more.And more.And now it seems that just about everyone has used one, and most people own one. I decided I was going to try and buy some to resell at school, and maybe I would make $50–100.Boy was I wrong.After I found them in wholesale quantities online, I realized just how cheap I could get them. These spinners were going for about $1.80, in quantities of 100 or more, and I needed to buy some.The next day at school I asked around about how much people were willing to pay for some, and heard that prices varied for $5 on amazon to $15 at the local 7-eleven.I decided to place an order for 100 of them. My total came out to just over $180, and I'm currently waiting on them to arrive.On Facebook, I found people willing to pay up to $15 for them, which isI'll update this once I start selling them.***To anyone saying that I am “ripping people off”, please understand the principle of supply and demand. Right now, where I am, these spinners are out of stock everywhere. The demand for them is extremely high, and stock is extremely low.This means I can charge what***UPDATE***THEY CAME IN!Today at around 5pm DHL showed up to my door with my box.here's all of them laid out!I've already sold 4, so hopefully this does turn into a good investment!

As you may recall in the beginning, everyone used a CPU to mine for bitcoins. Those days are long gone, but you can still mine on your CPU.Pros of miningCPU mining is very useful in the process of understanding mining. We strongly believe that's where every miner should start. You do not need any specialized hardware other than your computer. In the process of setting up the software, you will learn all the little tricks that are applicable to your hardware. You will also learn how the CPU will compare to more advanced hardware, such as GPUs and ASICs.To summarize, we encourage you to try CPU mining for the following reasons:Cons of miningCPU mining for Bitcoin is unfortunately no longer profitable. That is, it is highly unlikely that one could earn enough funds to cover the cost of electricity used up by the CPU .Best practices when mining with CPUsLet's look into the recommended things to do, when mining with CPUs. Although mining Bitcoin is no longer profitable with a CPU, mining other coins may bring in some profits. If you are going to use your CPU for mining, you might as well observe the practices that are going to make it easier and safer for you.First, make sure that your computer has adequate cooling and the CPU fan is working along with all the other fans in your computer. Make sure your computer has adequate airflow around it. There should not be anything directly around or on top of your computer. Basically, you need good airflow. The reason is that, while mining, your CPU's cores will be running at 100%, which will generate a good amount of heat. If that heat is not dissipated by the fans, it may cause damage to your hardware.Secondly, to get the most hashes out of your CPU, close all other programs running on your computer. If you are mining with a pool, have only the mining software open. If you are mining solo, you will also need to have your wallet open. Be aware that, if you are using your computer for any other purpose...Profitability of miningAs we have mentioned earlier, the Bitcoin network hash rate is really high now. Mining with a CPU is no longer guaranteed to bring in profits. This is due to the fact that, during the mining process, you are competing with other miners to try to solve a block. You will be at a disadvantage if those other miners are running faster hardware, as your hardware can only make a certain amount of guesses (hashes) in a given time frame.To compare the mining speed of a few CPU's, look at the follow the tableCPU don't hash fast.",18 followers,Asim Qureshi,850,996,155.3M,https://www.quora.com/Ive-made-6000-this-year-actively-trading-stocks-but-now-I-have-a-lot-on-my-plate-What-is-the-best-way-to-passively-invest-60-000
