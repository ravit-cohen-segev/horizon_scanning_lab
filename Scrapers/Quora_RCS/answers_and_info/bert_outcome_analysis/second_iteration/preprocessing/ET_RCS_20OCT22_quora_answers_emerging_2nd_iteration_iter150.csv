A solid example is the Coinstarhaven company (www.coinstarhaven,com), a company i invest my cryptocurrencies with that pays me double my invested amounts in 7 days of investmentThe early days of Bitcoin mining are often described as a gold rush.Satoshi Nakomoto’s invention of Bitcoin, “a peer-to-peer electronic cash system,” opened up an entirely new frontier, not just of freedom but of occasionally outrageous profits.Those with a strong interest in such things, namely cypherpunks, cryptographers, technically-minded libertarians and assorted hackers, were first to stake their claim.But is there still gold in them thar hills?The fact is:Bitcoin mining has grown from a handful of early enthusiasts into a cottage industry, into a specialized industrial-level venture. The easy money was scooped out a long time ago and what remains is buried under the cryptographic equivalent of tons of hard rock.The sad truth is:Only those with specialised, high-powered machinery are able to profitably extract bitcoins nowadays. While mining is still technicallyIn other words, mining won’t beWe’ll explain this situation in depth but first, you need to know a few basic technical terms from the world of Bitcoin mining:Block:A group of Bitcoin transactions, chosen fromA new block is created on average every ten minutes.Proof of Work Hashing:This is the cryptographic work which miners perform in order to find the solution which allows them to define a new block.PoW hashing ensures the proper function of the Bitcoin blockchain. Miners compete to solve a cryptographic “puzzle,” known as aThere are no shortcuts in this process, which can only be solved with raw computational power.By correctly hashing the current block, minersBlock Reward:The number of newly-created bitcoins, awarded to whichever miner creates a block.This number was initially set to 50, halved to 25 in late-2012, and halved again to 12.5 in mid-2016. The next halving event expected is around mid-2020.This halving process will continue in this fashion, halving the block reward approximately every four years / 210,000 blocks, until all 21 million bitcoins are created.Achieving the block reward is the only valid way in which new bitcoins can be created; by miners according to the code’s rate and limit.Hashrate:Hashrate is the measure of a miner’s computational power.The higher their relative power, the more solutions (and hence, block rewards) a miner is likely to find.Initially measured in hash per second (In early 2017, Bitcoin’s collective hashrate reached nearly 4 Exahash. This represents a tremendous investment into mining hardware, the R&D of such hardware, and electrical expenditure.Difficulty:With hashrate shooting up over the years, it would seem blocks would be found by miners ever more rapidly.Bitcoin’s Difficulty measure is what prevents this from happening. It adjusts to hashrate to ensure that blocks are found roughly every 10 minutes.Note how closely Difficulty matches Hashrate in the 2 charts above.When total hashrate rises, the Difficulty of POW hashing adjusts upwards – and the inverse also applies.Difficulty auto-adjusts every two weeks (or 2016 blocks).BTC / XBT exchange rate:The current fiat price of Bitcoin is critical for calculating profitabilityW/xHash/s:Watts per hashrate per second. Electricity is the major on-going cost of Bitcoin mining. The price paid per Watt will greatly influence profitability.Mining Pool:Unless you command a tremendous hashrate, your odds of solving a block by yourself (i.e. “solo-mining”) are extremely low.By banding together with other miners in a so-called pool, your combined odds of solving a block rise proportional to the pool’s total hashrate.Whenever they solve blocks, pools reward individual miners according to their contributed hashrate (minus commissions and the like).Calculating Mining ProfitabilityWith these terms in mind, it’s possible to calculate the current profitability (circa March 2017) of Bitcoin mining for your circumstances.Note:TheThis is due to the ever-changing nature of the Difficulty modifier and the BTC price, in particular.To begin, we must select a suitable ASIC mining rig. To aid in selection, the Bitcoin Wiki provides a handy mining hardware comparison:Although Bitcoin Wiki doesn’t list many models as currently shipping on from their manufacturers, all these mining rigs (and more) are available for resale as new or used.The Bitmain AntMiner S9 is a modern mining rig which offers a good hashrate for its power consumption.It’s pretty much the cutting edge of mining tech so we’ll select it for our example.The S9 is available for roughly $1800 up to $2400 from Amazon, or about $1365 from BitMain, shipping excluded. Power supply units will add another $120 or so to the price.Next, we need to enter the S9’s specs and cost, as well as other info such as power cost and pool fees, into a suitable number-cruncher.Cryptocurrency Mining vs. Bitcoin Mining Profitability offers a good mining profitability calculator, which automatically fills in the currentScenario 1: Big Chinese MinersWe are using the defaultTo determine your own power cost, check worldwide electricity prices or your utility bill for the exact price.The 0%Once all the necessary info is entered, hitAn excellent result! At this rate, the S9 unit would pay for itself within a year as well as make about $600 in profit! As a large miner would be able to negotiate a lower unit price on each S9, we can assume they’ll research profit even sooner.Scenario 2: An American Hobby MinerBefore getting too excited about your potential mining profits, let’s recalculate them using the average residential power cost per kWh in the USA (~12.5c) and a typical pool fee of 1%.The result:It’s not looking so great now.At a Bitcoin price around $1150, it appears that the average American home miner makes only $1348 a year, assuming difficulty and price hold steady. In other words, the unit will pay for itself within a year.However:This is a dangerous assumption! Bitcoin’s total hashrate – and thus its difficulty, has been consistently rising since the early years, sometimes jumping by double digit percentages within a month!Therefore, any calculations should be regarded skeptically, as likely best-case scenarios.Sources ofDifficulty Spikes, Price Crashes, Equipment Failures, Power Cuts, Shipping Delays & More!Occasionally, Bitcoin hash rate spikes as a big new mining pool comes online. This happened in early 2016:It’s quite possible that even some big, corporate miners found their profit margins under threat from the resulting steep spike in competition. Indeed, in mid-2016, Swedish Bitcoin mining firm KnCMiner declares BankruptcyThe home miner really has no chance to compete in such a challenging environment, unless they have access to free or extremely low-cost electricity…Also bear in mind that the rate of obsolescence in Bitcoin mining hardware is quite fast! New, more efficient mining hardware may be released at any time, although we are reaching the technological limits of improved efficiencies.If pre-ordering any such equipment, be aware that potential manufacturing, shipping, customs or other delays could end up being very costly as difficulty rises or price falls during the interim.There are plenty of other things which can wrong, for example:Such downside risks must always be factored into any sound business plan.ConclusionThe average home miner will struggle to be profitable or recoup the cost of mining hardware and electricity, especially with the Bitcoin downward price trendProfitability is highly unlikely given the current circumstances.The situation may improve in future once ASIC mining hardware innovation reaches the point of diminishing returns.That, coupled with cheap, hopefully sustainable power solutions may once again make Bitcoin mining profitable to small individual miners around the world.This would also greatly improve the decentralization of the Bitcoin network, hardening it against legislative risk.",2 followers,Kelly Pearson,1.7K,0,0,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-future-of-mining-cryptocurrency-Hardware-software-and-or-hibrid

Miners can set up a hardware operation by themselves or join forces with a large venture via cloud mining. If you are looking to enter this field in 2020, here is what you need to know about the business.What Does It Take to Mine Bitcoin in 2020Bitcoin mining is a transaction security and validation service done via distributed computer systems each racing to solve complex mathematical problems before the competition.Miners Keep the global ledger consistent and immutable by repeatedly adding newly requested transactions into a block, which is then broadcast to the network and verified. For providing their valuable hashing power to the cryptocurrency network, miners are rewarded each time a new block is created by them in this fashion.Anyone thinking about entering this line of work needs to know that long gone are the days where one could just mine bitcoin with a desktop PC or even an old laptop. These days, any profitable bitcoin mining is done via computer systems tailored exclusively for the task, professionally called application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) miners. The most popular bitcoin mining machines are the Antminer series from Bitmain, but there are additional hardware offerings from companies such as Microbt, Canaan, Ebang and a few others. Take note that while some machines are available to be purchased off shelf already, or even immediately as second hand goods in online markets, when the newer models come out there is often a waiting period until they are shipped, and you need to take that into consideration.Other than the upfront cost of the hardware, your main expense as a miner is electricity. The power is primarily for operation of the computer systems themselves, but also for ventilation and air conditioning systems that might be needed depending on the situation. This is why professional miners routinely migrate around the world to locations that can offer them an optimal combinationof lower electricity prices and hospitable weather.Once the hardware is all set up, you then need to direct your mining machines to a mining pool such as F2pool, Pooling and Antpool. These are groupings of miners that compete to get a block together and share the rewards according to the contributed hashing power, thus spreading the work and streamlining the revenue for each one.How to Start Cloud Mining With BitcoinAn easier alternative to setting up your own mining operation is to go for cloud mining. This is a way to generate cryptocurrency that doesn’t require buying any expensive equipment, or installing the infrastructure needed for it. All you have to do is find a provider that you trust and buy a contract from them, which is in essence renting hash power in a dedicated facility. Zippercoin is one of such provider, with a cloud mining service focused on bitcoin cash(BCH) and BTC.Goodluck…","3,397 followers",Raymond Scottman,1.1K,0,0,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-future-of-mining-cryptocurrency-Hardware-software-and-or-hibrid

As the value of crypto-assets rises, more people enter the market. These newcomers are constantly attempting to figure out how to profit from cryptocurrency.The good news is that there are numerous methods to profit from cryptocurrency. Since 2011, the bitcoin business has seen constant growth in developer engagement, social media activity, and the number of start-ups launched.We'll look at ways to generate money with cryptocurrencies in this article.Can You Make Money With Cryptocurrency?Yes, cryptocurrency may be used to create money. Because of the inherent volatility of crypto assets, the majority of them are high-risk, while some necessitate subject knowledge or skill.One of the ways to generate money using bitcoin is to trade cryptocurrencies. Despite the fact that the daily average volume of cryptocurrency trades is only 1% of the foreign exchange market, the crypto market is extremely volatile. As a result, there is the potential for short-term trading.Even though the cryptocurrency business is still small, it has a lot of room to develop. Along with some of the more well-known cryptos, such as:Similarly, there are a slew of crypto-buying services, such as Binance, Coinbase, and Robinhood, giving you lots of alternatives when it comes to generating money with cryptocurrency.Apart from the obvious manner of trading, there are a variety of ways to make legal money using cryptocurrency.Let's look at an insight trick which no one talks about that automatically generate cryptocurrency learn6 Strategies for Making Money with CryptoLook no further if you want to learn how to generate money with cryptocurrencies. Three mechanisms are used to make money with cryptocurrency:Here are six techniques for making money with cryptocurrencies based on these three mechanisms:Each of this techniques are great and explored in details.. Note learn insight trick that will always generate cryptocurrency for you find out1. InvestingInvesting is a long-term strategy that involves purchasing and holding crypto assets for an extended period of time. In general, crypto assets are well-suited to a buy-and-hold strategy. They are highly volatile in the short term but offer enormous long-term growth potential.The investing approach necessitates the identification of more stable assets that will last for a long time. Bitcoin and Ethereum, for example, have a history of long-term price increases and can be regarded secure investments in this regard.2. TradingWhile investing is a long-term strategy centered on buy-and-hold, trading is designed to take advantage of short-term opportunities.The cryptocurrency market is quite volatile. This means that asset prices can fluctuate considerably in the short term.You must possess the necessary analytical and technical skills to be a successful trader. To create correct forecasts about price increases and declines, you'll need to evaluate market charts on the performance of the listed assets.Depending on whether you expect the price of an asset to climb or fall, you can take a long or short position while trading. This means you can earn whether the cryptocurrency market is bullish or bearish.3. Staking and LendingStaking is a method of verifying cryptocurrency transactions. You hold coins when you stake, but you don't spend them. You keep the coins in a cryptocurrency wallet instead. Your coins are then used to validate transactions on a Proof of Stake network. As a result, you will be rewarded. To put it another way, you're lending coins to the network. This permits the network's security and transaction verification to be maintained. You'll get a reward that's equivalent to the interest a bank would pay on a credit amount.The Proof of Stake algorithm selects transaction validators depending on the amount of coins you've pledged to stake. As a result, it consumes far less energy than crypto mining and does not necessitate the purchase of expensive machinery.You can also choose to lend coins to other investors in exchange for interest.4. Crypto Social MediaYou will be rewarded for creating and curating content on a number of blockchain-based social media networks. You are frequently awarded with the platform's own coin.5. MiningCryptocurrencies mining is a way to generate money using cryptocurrency in the same way that the early adopters did. Mining is still an important part of the Proof of Work system. It is here that a cryptocurrency's value is created.You get rewarded with new coins if you mine a cryptocurrency. You'll require technical know-how and an upfront investment in specialized hardware to mine.Mining is a subset of running a master node. It necessitates knowledge and a large initial and ongoing expenditure.6. Airdrops and ForksTo raise awareness, airdrops and free tokens are issued. To build a big user base for a project, an exchange might execute an airdrop. You can acquire a free currency by participating in an airdrop, which you may then use to buy items, invest in, or trade with.A blockchain forks when aprotocol changes or improves, resulting in the creation of new currency. If you have coins on the old chain, you will usually receive free tokens on the new one. This indicates that because you were in the correct position at the right moment, you received a free coin.More~learn how to grow crypto automaticallyThanks for your time Make sure you gave me an upvote and share if my airticle added value",242 followers,Sumit Kumar,2.1K,0,0,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-future-of-mining-cryptocurrency-Hardware-software-and-or-hibrid
