9,"Okay. So you've figured out that you would like to write for magazines, newspapers, and e-zines. Unfortunately, so have about eight gazillion other people on this planet.

What you do need, however, is the IDEA for the great story. You will use this great idea to convince eOkay. So you've figured out that you would like to write for magazines, newspapers, and e-zines. Unfortunately, so have about eight gazillion other people on this planet. Therefore, you have to stand out from the crowd. You have to sparkle. How do you do this? Simple. It all starts with The Big Idea. The first secret you must learn in this funny business is that you dont have to write the whole article to get a job. Only bright green novices attempt to write the whole thing before selling it. What you do need, however, is the IDEA for the great story. You will use this great idea to convince editors to pay you exorbitant amounts of money via a proposal letter (called a query letter. But you'll learn about that in a minute).So, where will you find this Big Idea? Well, you've heard that wise adage write what you know. That's a wonderful mantra for finding your jumping-off point. You dont need to stick to what you know for the specific focus of your story but tap into your already huge vat of knowledge to find the storys basis. This is how you will become an expert. Experts are in demand. People with stories aren't. What you have to do is sneak your stories into your areas of expertise. For example let's say your hobbies and interests include fishing, watching talk shows, and traveling. Good! You are a potential expert in those areas. Jot these things down. Now comes the fun part: brainstorming.The biggest mistake you can make in pitching your story is being too general. Never, ever send a letter to the editor suggesting an article about fishing. Not even an article about fishing in Florida. This vagueness is not appropriate for short writing. In general, you will be expected to write somewhere between 800 and 2000 words on your topic. You couldn't possibly tell us all about fishing in 2000 words. What you could do, however, is give us a comparison of twelve different lures used to catch sailfish. Or the pros and cons of joining a fishing club. Or even how the moon can tell you if it'll be a good fishing day.So here's your first assignment. Get out your trusty notebook. (If you dont have one, stop reading and get one. Right now.) On the first page, write down a list of any topics that interest you. It's okay to be general here. Need some ideas to get you started?Think through your whole day. Dont neglect anything. What do you do from the moment you wake up until the moment you fall asleep? You turn off your alarm clock. (An article about alarm clocks disrupting valuable sleep stages! Or waking up to music versus waking up to that annoying beeping sound. Or the optimal number of times to press the snooze button.) You brush your teeth. (Article: What all those touted ingredients fluorides, peroxide, baking soda do for your teeth.) You take a shower. Maybe with your significant other. Lucky you. (Romantic showers for two.)Moving on. You go to work. This is the most obvious area of expertise. Let's say you're a secretary. How ergonomic office equipment can save you from Carpal Tunnel Syndrome, an achy back, and a stiff neck. How to avoid screaming at your boss when he's a total idiot. Five couples (or ex-couples) share their wisdom about dating in the office. Think about what cover story would entice you to pay three dollars for a magazine. You dont have to know to write the article yet. You just have to know you can get this information later.Next, you come home. What happens? Do you have kids? Great! A wealth of article ideas. You could write about childcare agencies, potty training, decoding teenage slang, teaching table manners youre getting the idea now, right? Run with it!Write at least one page of general topics that interest you, then weed out the most interesting ones. Narrow it down to three or four. Then write those three or four topics on top of brand new pages. Now fill up those pages with specific article angles. Just write. Dont edit yourself. Dont judge. Just write whatever pops into your head. If you need motivation, play it like a game of Scattergories. Set a timer for ten minutes. See how many ideas you can jot down before the timer sounds.Keep in mind that there are markets for almost any conceivable topic. Dont limit yourself to the headlines you'd read in Vogue and Good Housekeeping. Between newspapers, consumer magazines, trade magazines, e-zines, tabloids, literary journals, and more, you're bound to find an appropriate publication for your Big Idea.Do you want to know more about these markets? Read on!Researching the MarketsFirst, you'll need a few definitions:Consumer Magazines: These typically pay the best. These are the types of magazines you might find in a grocery store check-out line, convenience store, in your airplane seat pocket, or your doctor's office. Types of consumer mags: men, women, special interest, inflight, teens, school/career, travel, health, ethnic/minority, political, entertainment, romance, religious, etc. This is the area most writers try to break into.Literary Magazines: These dont pay much, if at all. However, what they lack in the moolah, they make up for in prestige. If youre looking to jump-start your career as a fiction writer or poet, your best chance at recognition may come in the form of one of these small publications. Often published by colleges and universities, their circulation is usually regional and low. They generally seek scholarly essays, intellectually challenging prose, poetry, and book reviews. Publishers will be impressed if you succeed in placing your work in one of the more prominent journals (Cimarron Review, Ploughshares, and Story, for example).Trade Journals: Pay varies greatly. Any publication that focuses on a particular occupation/industry falls into this category. This is where your expertise can shine. There are trade journals for almost every line of work, from art dealers to truck drivers. In general, your written eloquence is not as important as your research and timely knowledge for these publications.E-Zines: Pay varies greatly. Simply put, e-zines are simply magazines on the Internet. The only major difference is that articles for e-zines can usually run longer than print magazines. (No printing costs, so space isn't as important an issue for e-zine editors.) Most e-zines dont pay (except using a byline) but this trend is changing. The most popular sites (Now that you know, learn how to contact them!There are tons of ways to find markets that are open to freelancers. If you were paying attention, you might notice that this very website is looking for writers! Finding places to submit your work is easy if you know where to look.First, the most important tool in a freelancer's toolbox is The Writers Market. Available at any major bookstore, this is an annual compilation of more than 2,000 magazines, 1,000 book publishers, and even specialized markets like greeting cards, scriptwriting, and syndicates.The next best tools are online. Lucky you! They're free. Absolute Market is a weekly e-zine filled with market guidelines, contest listings, and marketing tips. Freelancing4Money puts out a jam-packed e-zine filled with freelance opportunities. Writer's Digest has a great, searchable database of markets. Writing For Dollars has a biweekly newsletter with market guidelines and a searchable database on the website. And Writers Weekly lists calls for writers and market guidelines each week.You can even run a search for freelance writers on any major search engine, and youre likely to come up with tons of listings. Try specifying if possible; add words that fit your needs. (Example: paying markets, romance, teen magazines.)So, your next assignment is this: go back to your trusty notebook and pick out your very favorite idea. That will now be known as your Big Idea. Pick the markets that best fit your idea. Choose several. Find out if you can get a free or discounted sample copy. (Writers often can, if you specify that you would like to query them in the future.) Request writer's guidelines if available. It's considered poor form to query publications that you've never read, or know nothing about. Do your best to read at least one copy of whatever magazine or journal you plan to query. Check your library for copies if you prefer not to go broke researching.Got it now? You have your idea, and you've found places to submit it? Great! Then you'll need to learn the proper protocol for writing and submitting the Killer Query.The Killer QueryThe job of the query letter is to entice an editor to say, Hey! It is interested in learning more about that. Therefore, you dont want to spill all your secrets and research yet. You want to tease and tantalize. Now that you've got your fabulous Big Idea, your job is to condense (or expand) that idea into two to three paragraphs.To illustrate the components of a killer query, here is an example of one of mine (using fictitious contact info sorry!) that landed me the assignment:Jenna Glatzer(Always use proper formal letter format)123 My AddressMy City, State, Zip Code(555) 555-5555Mr. Joe Shmoe(Make SURE to get a name of the appropriate department College Life 101editor. Never address a letter to editor or submissions.)123 Their AddressTheir City, State, Zip CodeToday's Date, 2003Dear Mr. Shmoe:(Colons are used in formal letters. Commas are used in friendly letters.)Think company cars, expense accounts, and a spacious office with bay windows. Who do you picture running a business this successful?(Start the letter with a zinger that captures the essence of your proposed article/story. Raise a question that will cause the reader to think, or give a visual image of anything that will make him/her want to read on and find out what youre talking about.)Think again. This company was the brainchild of three Boston University sophomores whose ambitions led them to thriving careers before they had diplomas to hang on the wall.(The rest of the first paragraph should give a concise description of the focus of your proposed article. Remember to tell why it's appropriate to the publication youre querying. In this case, I was targeting a college magazine, so I made sure to emphasize the relevance to their subject matter early in the letter.)Charles Strader, Richard Skelton, and Pablo Mondal run Net One, an Internet Service Provider. The three men in the freshmen dorms then moved into an apartment together. Opportunity knocked when Strader, who worked for the university's computer center, took a phone call from the owner of a hair salon. She sought help designing a website; Strader volunteered, and Net One was born.(Again, concisely, get a little deeper into the content of the article. What is special about your story? In this case, I wanted to emphasize that these guys were college buddies who started a booming business by branching out from their humble beginning.)Working closely with friends to build something we believe in is Monday's favorite perk. Skelton agrees. We have great trust in each other and feel that we're all in this together.(Quotations aren't necessary for a query, but it's nice to give something specific to show that you have done some research into your topic and that you have access to resources that will enable you to write the article well. I wanted to show that I had already spoken to these guys they happen to be friends of mine and that they would be upbeat and inspirational people to interview. You can accomplish the same effect by including a few quirky facts or survey results you've found out about your topic.)Considering that their only capital was a computer and a small loan from Strader's father, the guys feel very successful. We're not millionaires, but we have goals, and we're following them, says Skelton. I think that's true success. By any definition, Net One's roster of more than 50 clients ranging from colleges to Fortune 500 companies attests to their hard work and talent.(Look, editor. These guys are big up-and-comers! Notice I mentioned Fortune 500 companies. This lets the editor know quickly that these college guys arent small potatoes. It neatly ties up the opening sentence, which promised an article about guys who have a spacious office, expense accounts, and company cars. Now the editor has a reason to believe that these guys are that successful.)I propose a 1,000-word profile for your Students At Work section.(Shows I've researched their magazine. I know which section this should fit, and I've read their guidelines to determine an appropriate word count.)I am a full-time freelance writer, and my works have been recently featured in such publications as 201 Magazine, College Bound(Notice I mention the most relevant magazines first. Anything you've had published that might relate to the content, tone, or audience of the proposed publication belongs here.)Bliss!, Working Women, and Video Librarian. Clips are enclosed.(If you've never had anything published, dont distress. Just shut up about it. Do NOT tell anyone, Though I've never been published yet, I'm a real go-getter. Less is more. If you keep quiet, they may not even think about the fact that you didn't mention your credits. Also, do not get into a diatribe describing how you edited your high school newspaper. Just a quick list of relevant writing backgrounds. See below for info about clips.)I can provide documentation and interview notes for easy fact-checking, and could submit the completed article within two weeks.(Optional. Some people like to suggest a time frame, others let the editor do it. In general, the editor will tell you when the article is due, regardless of your preferences. It's a nice touch to mention how you will research your article. Mine was primarily dependent on interviews, but you may wish to include the names of journals/experts you plan to quote or use for information.)I look forward to your response.(Obligatory polite ending. Use any variation you wish. No pleading. If you dare type, I promise to write a good article! Please hire me! you will incur my wrath. I will hunt you down and yell at you. A lot. Just a simple, dignified ending requesting a response.)Regards,Jenna Glatzer(Oh. Substitute your name and preferred signature ending. Unless you feel like sending your paycheck to me, in which case, you can feel free to use my name. Grin.)Finally, clips! If you've had anything published or even if you haven't, but you have a few good writing samples appropriate for this type of market include them. These samples are called clips, and they are used to show the editor that you are an intelligent, insightful, funny, clever, and/or excellent writer. Photocopy your articles straight from the publication. Just 2-3 clips.When you're sending queries by e-mail, you can paste the text of your clips into the body of the e-mail (never as an attachment!), or you can direct the editor to one or two website URLs where she can view your articles.Interviews and ProfilesI know you feel weird about this one, right? You're uncomfortable calling someone or visiting a business to ask a professional to take precious time out of their day to help you research your article.Well, buck up, little camper, because most professionals love to be interviewed. They jump at the chance, for a few reasons. These are the reasons to keep in mind when you feel small and silly for asking:Before you approach experts:Make sure you already have your questions mapped out, at least briefly. What exactly do you need to know from this person? What could this person tell you that no one else can? Avoid yes or no questions. Ask open-ended questions that could lead to lengthy responses chock full of great quotes. Also, have a synopsis of your planned article ready, so you can tell your expert what youre writing and how they can supplement your knowledge.How to approach experts:Get on the phone. Have your idea condensed into 2-3 sentences, so you can quickly explain yourself to whoever answers the phone.Hello. My name is Jenna, and I'm writing an article about the rise in vegetarianism among young women in Nevada for Youth In Nevada Magazine. I know Dr. Spuds is a well-respected nutritionist, and I'm hoping she would be willing to answer a few questions on this subject.At this point, the secretary will say, Hold, and make you listen to elevator music while she summons the boss. Or she'll take down your number and have Dr. Spuds call you back. Or it will be Dr. Spuds herself, and shell say, What do you want to know?Your options at this point are (1) Ask questions over the phone, right then and there. Make sure you check to make sure your expert is not pressed for time before you begin. (2) Set up a phone date to conduct the interview. (3) Ask if you can meet in person. This is good almost necessary if the person will be the focus of your article. If the person is being used just to add a few quotes, you dont have to meet in person, because it's unlikely you'll ever need to write, Dr. Spuds wrinkled her brow and stared into her pea soup as she explained that young women are becoming more health-conscious. (4) Trade e-mail addresses and send over a list of questions. This approach isn't usually the best, because it doesn't allow you to react to, and build from, the information you gain in answers to previous questions. However, if the publication will not reimburse you for long-distance phone calls, and you have to conduct a lengthy interview, e-mail exchanges are acceptable. Just make! sure you specify a due date for the responses. Be reasonabletry to give the expert a week to answer all your questions.The SalesOkay, you sent out your killer query, and you got a phone call from an editor with the big news: you got the assignment! Congratulations, you! Go on and do a little dance of joy, then crash back to reality with your new mantra: GET IT IN WRITING. Make sure the editor tells you that a written contract is forthcoming shortly.If you've researched your market, you probably already have an idea of the pay rate, but be sure to cover this ground in that initial phone call if the editor fails to mention it. Important things to remember:On Publication vs. On AcceptanceYou not only need to know how much you'll be paid but also when you'll be paid. Many markets want to pay you for publication. This can be a problem because many magazines and journals have long lead times. (Translation: a long time between when they assign you the article and when it ends up in print.) If you write an article in January, and it doesn't get published until November, you probably won't see a check until December. Do you want to wait a year to get paid? Can you wait that long? This is a point you absolutely can negotiate. Ask for payment on acceptance. If this is refused, it gives you a little leverage to work with on the other issues, which areKill FeesIf you get the assignment, and, for whatever reason, an editor decides not to print your article, you can negotiate for a kill fee. This is a percentage of the sale price. If you are offered $200 to write an article, you may get a $50 kill fee. It's a well-known fact that big publications kill articles all the time. Some editors admit to assigning 10-20% more than they could ever fit in the magazine. They do this so they can pick and choose from the final products, or so they can see how things fit once the layout is complete. Some articles will be pushed back to other issues, and some will just be trashed.BiosWe like them. Those are the little blurbs that often follow an article, giving short biographical information about the writer, and sometimes an e-mail address or phone number. Ask for one if you can.Sidebars and PhotosThose are the little factoids or columns that rest next to the main article. For example, in an article about exercise, you'll often see a little chart on the side that tells how many calories are burned by doing specific exercises (riding a bike, climbing a hill, etc.). If you can suggest sidebars, you can often get extra pay. Same goes for photos. If you've got a decent camera and a good eye, offer photos for a few extra bucks.To Spec or Not To SpecEspecially as a novice writer, you'll sometimes get asked to write an article on speculation. This means that you'll have to write the whole article and submit it without a contract, or any promise of payment. It's a bone of contention among professional writers because almost no other field works this way. It's never doing the job, and then I'll decide if I feel like paying you. Only in this crazy business. Harrumph.That said, I advise you to take spec assignments in the beginning. Once youre established, you shouldn't need to do this, but to build up your resume and your clips, you need to get published. So go ahead and submit on spec, and go ahead and do a few free/nearly free pieces for the experience.Before submitting anything, though, make sure you know in advance what the terms will be if the editor does use your piece. How much will you be paid? What rights will they buy?Even many of the big markets have adopted the practice of requesting pieces on spec. They do this because they can get away with it. Because there are thousands of wannabe writers out there who will beg, borrow, and steal for the chance to be published. So, if you want to compete, sometimes you have to suck it up and accept this. Once the publication accepts one of your spec pieces, youll be a much more likely candidate for an outright assignment next time.Rights to WriteThere are several kinds of rights a publication may buy:First North American Serial RightsThe newspaper or magazine has the right to publish this piece for the first time in any periodical. All other rights belong to the writer.One-Time RightsThe publication buys the nonexclusive right to publish the piece once. The writer can sell the same article to other publications simultaneously.Second Serial Rights (or Reprint Rights)Also nonexclusive. Gives the publication the right to reprint an article that has appeared elsewhere.Electronic RightsCovers CD-ROMs, e-zines, website content, games, etc. Get in writing which electronic rights are specified-- First Electronic Rights, archiving rights, etc. Most publications ask for the right to archive ""indefinitely."" You can try to negotiate for a fixed term (i.e., archiving rights for six months).All RightsPretty is self-explanatory. You can never sell this piece to anyone else again. Try to avoid this one. Most publications ask for First Serial Rights.Work-For-Hire Rights-- The publication has come up with the idea and assigned it to you, and they will own it, lock, stock, and barrel. They own the copyright and don't even have to give you credit. It may be sliced, diced, repackaged, re-sold, etc., and you won't have any claim to it beyond what you were originally paid.TV/Motion Picture RightsAlso self-explanatory. Almost always exclusive.Recycling Your Big IdeasThis is the bread and butter of freelance writing. It's also called re-slanting. Once you've got a Big Idea, dont waste it by only using it once. Use the information you've gathered and come up with off-shoot ideas. Slant it to appeal to different markets.You're afraid because of the issue of rights that we just discussed, right? (No pun intended.) Well, you have nothing to fear, provided the new article is sufficiently different in content and intended audience. If you've managed to sell your article to a major national magazine, it is considered poor form to try to sell a re-slanted version to another national magazine.However, if youre dealing with regional, specialized, or small publications, there should be a very little overlap of the intended audience. Therefore, an editor from Alabama Aristocrats would probably never know if you sold a re-slanted version of your piece to Guitarists Today. Even if they did know, they almost certainly would not care.It is standard and accepted practice, for the simple reason that it is darn difficult to make a living as a writer. If you have the choice between making $100 for selling your piece to one small publication, or making $1000 by selling altered versions to eight different small publications, which would you choose?Re-slanting an article is easy since you've done the bulk of the research. Scrounge up a few new quotes, and use the information you left out of the first article. Focus it on the new desired market.For example, I could sell an article about the health benefits of meditation to a fitness magazine. A few alterations and that same article become Religions Encouraging Meditation for my local newspapers Society pages. Then it becomes Meditation Makes You Smarter for the college market. Then, Meditate Your Stress Away for a working woman magazine. And I didn't even mention all those new age/holistic publications. What a field day!With just a few more questions posed to your trusted experts, you've got a whole new article. And, look! You're becoming an expert yourself. This is how you begin to find your niche few specific subjects that you feel comfortable writing about. Ah, soon those journalists will be coming to YOU with their questions.""The Extras""Once you've got a few assignments, and feel that you've embarked on this as a potential career (or just a part-time income-booster), youll want to think about the little extras.A nice touch: get yourself some nice letterhead. Splurge a little with your second or third paycheck and invest in professionally printed letterhead. The presentation does count when submitting your correspondence to an editor. Avoid cutesy clip art of quill pens and inkwells.Also, an invoice. You should always include an invoice with your completed article. Often, the person you submit the story to is not the same in charge of sending you a paycheck. By including an invoice, you can be reasonably assured that the billing department will have a record of what terms were agreed upon, and when they are supposed to pay you.Receipts: Hold onto your postage receipts and your writing-related supplies. If writing is your profession, then these can be tax write-offs. Also, if you can negotiate it, editors will often reimburse you for any expenses you incur while on assignment once you are an established writer. Submit your phone bill (with the reimbursable call/s circled), your book receipts, your travel expense receipts, etc. along with your invoice. Make sure these terms are specified in your contract.You're ready? Good! Get out there and get 'em, slugger. Good luck!",70 followers,Hai Feng Kao,1.6K,0,0,https://www.quora.com/Is-it-conceivable-that-any-human-will-be-remembered-10-000-years-from-now-100-000-Even-longer

It was also fun going above and beyond the requirements and making something amazing (at the time).I know this isn’t much today, but my teacher was pretty damn impressed.

It can only approximate square roots and irrationals like pi when you set it to some amount of digits. It still doesn’t use floating point math though, which doesn’t make it very fast or efficient for approximate calculations.Basically, I use it sometimes, it’s nice. Maybe you’ll like it too.

It looked like this:But he’s a 180 pound man. Even though he’s tiny, he’s still 180 pounds. And that 180 pounds is resting on really tiny legs and feet. The pounds per square inch would be off the charts.In reality, he would easily fall right through the roof. And the car seat, and the undercarriage. He’d hit the pavement, and probably keep going. He’d sink through the concrete, hit dirt, and just keep going. If he hit a thick steel pipe, heHe’s just way too heavy for surfaces to hold him up. The pounds per square inch of his feet is just too high. It’s possible that he would just keep sinking until he got near the center of the earth, and gravity stopped pulling him down. As soon he shrunk, he’d immediately break through whatever he’s standing on.-Another thing is air. Even though Scott Lang is shrunk, he still needs the equal amount of oxygen to survive. He shrinks, but the air around him doesn’t. Scott becomes denser, but the air doesn’t.-Let’s say that in one breath, you bring in a cubic foot of air, which contains 100 oxygen molecules. Your lungs take in the oxygen molecules, and use them to keep you alive. You need to get 100 oxygen molecules per breath, or you’ll asphyxiate.At Scott’s size, he still needs 100 oxygen molecules per breath to stay alive. His body is still the same, just smaller.But his tiny lungs can only take in one cubic inch of air in a single breath. In that cubic inch, there’s probably only a single oxygen molecule. One oxygen molecule isn’t nearly enough to survive.Scott would shrink, survive on last breath he took while normal sized, then immediately asphyxiate.-The exact same principle applies to his vision. His eyes get much smaller, but the amount of visible light stays the same. His tiny eyes would only be receiving a fraction of what normal people would. He would be almost blind.Same thing with his hearing. His ears wouldn’t pick up most noise vibrations, because most would just miss him. He’d be deaf too.On top of it all, his tiny larynx would vibrate much faster than than normal humans, so he would sound like he’d been breathing helium. Not that you’d be able to hear him, because there’s so little air in his lungs, he wouldn’t be able to project his voice at all.-So, when Ant-Man shrunk, he’d be blind, deaf, mute, asphyxiating, and rapidly sinking through the earth.Sorry Scott.",41 followers,W J E,2.1K,158,404.3K,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-most-useful-tools-every-programmer-should-have

There are games and entertainment arcades. There are places were people can play sports.And this is for a 3 week trip.BUT THIS SHIP LACKS A LOT OF MISSION CRITICAL EQUIPMENT!All it took was one tiny piece of space debris, a loose screw, to render the entire ship helpless.In the film, the Aniara was on the way to Mars from Earth, carrying thousands of human settlers.Along the way, they had to steer away to avoid space debris. No one bother to install shielding or armor protecting? They have massive space elevators but no such shielding technology? Even some strong armor plating for the vital ship parts would have been good.But that’s fine I guess. Its more important to have a big events hall that can seat hundreds for shows. We also have a massive projector wall so everyone can see the captain speak and welcome everyone to the trip.The Aniara successfully dodges the debris but one screw hits their fuel storage and ignites it. They are forced to eject all fuel to prevent an explosion and destroy the entire ship. But there is only one stock of fuel on board? No emergency supply? No back up engines? Just one main engine, fueled by one fuel source?This collision resulted in the Aniara veering off course and they have no way of steering back. No emergency lifeboats? No long range communications? No way to call help from Mars/Earth to rescue them?The entire spaceship doomed because of one tiny screw.But sure let’s install this state of the art AI VR system so passengers can experiences their memories of Earth to soothe anxieties of space travel.If the Aniara’s designers spent more time focusing on mission critical equipment and features instead of passenger entertainment, the ship would have made it to its destination and there would be no tragic film.Instead they prioritized making it an amazing 3 week trip that ended up causing chaos and loss of life.",26 followers,Ricardo Soares,5.6K,327,2.9M,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-most-useful-tools-every-programmer-should-have

There's also a practical concern that our bodies cannot withstand long periods of weightlessness. So I don't mind seeing artificial gravity, however it might be explained.There's a technical issue with the amount of extra weight artificial gravity would give your ship. Think about it - when you're accelerating or decelerating, you'd want to have as little mass as possible. Energy supply is never an issue, I suppose, when you have dilithium crystals on board.But here's the thing that truly bugs me about it. If you need to have artifical gravity, why would it run the length of the ship?Wouldn't a ship oriented like a skyscraper make so much more sense?Then, the artificial gravity isnt a big long strip. It's located at just a single point - the bottom of the ship.In fact, when a “tower” ship is accelerating in one direction, it wouldn't even need the artificial gravity, it would just turn it off. Because if the ship is accelerating at 1G, it's making its own gravity.The same would be true when decelerating.So it would be incredibly more efficient, so much more efficient than a ship which is oriented like an aircraft carrier.This “tower” orientation isn't actually new to science fiction either:It's just that at some point, we seemingly lost our way.From the 1970s to now, spaceships all use the awkward “navy in space” look.It's stupid because it makes no sense, and it bugs me every time I see it.",95 followers,Gál Rolland,1.2K,170,511.4K,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-most-useful-tools-every-programmer-should-have

And Plan A of their mission even purportedly calls for theirHowever, the cluster of planets in the other galaxy are orbited by a massive black hole called Gargantua, the gravitational pull of which results in an extreme time dilation, causing every hour spent within it to count as seven years on Earth!Luckily, only one of the planets on the other side of the wormhole is actually situated within this extreme time dilation.Still, time is a gargantuan concern for ex-NASA pilot turned farmer Cooper—one of the four astronauts—who has two young children back on Earth whom he desperately wants to see grow up. He is dead set on steering clear of the time dilation as much as humanly possible. And landing on that planet would be his absolute worst nightmare.Seems logical. Time is a factor forAnyway, they pass through the wormhole without issue, as expected. And they are well outside of Gargantua’s gravitation pull. All is well up to that point and they can now strategize on what potentially habitable planet to investigate first.Now, another team of astronauts had actually gone through the wormhole a decade before them on a one-way journey in order to determine the habitability of each of the planets found on the other side of the wormhole. This is how the data was transmitted; each indidvual member of the original astronaut team took a chance on their individual planets, with each of them knowing that—due to limitation of resources—they’d possibly end up stranded on their planets alone to die, either instantaneously or over years time.The plan for these original interstellar astronauts was to emit their beaconsWhen the new team of astronauts arrive on the other side of that wormhole a decade after the original team, they detectCooper and the new team of astronauts have to decide which planet they visit first. Fuel—in addition to time—is also a factor. So they must be smart in their decision making process. And the closest planet to them where the beacon is still going off just so happens to be….The planet within the gravitation time dilation of Gargantua.Now, they know about the time dilation. They realize every hour they spend on that planet known as Miller’s planet—named after the original astronaut who landed there—will cost themBut the beacon is clearly going off, the planet is the closest one to them, and it looks to be habitable from where they are. It’s a watery planet like Earth…Cooper doesn’t want to go, but he’s outvoted by his crew mates, hence, they travel to Miller’s planet, and if you’ve seen the movie, you know the kind of disaster that awaits them.So, here’s where I have a huge problem with this:Given the extreme time dilation—of which they were aware of—why didn’t any one of these extraordinarily intelligent astronauts consider the fact that Miller had only been on her planet for onlyTo recapitulate, the original explorers were supposed to activate their beaconsRegardless of the signal, however, they should’ve realized thatI just can’t help to feel like anyone capable of critical thinking would’ve at least considered this multi-faceted scenario.

Dune has ‘defensive energy shields’ that block all projectiles, while it explodes upon being hit by lasers (which seems implausible, given that a laser is just coherent light). Star Wars has the Force. The bat’leth has no excuse apart from being ceremonial.It’s not difficult to understand why sci-fi writers do this. Melee fights are cool and relatable. They can be dragged out more which is useful when you want to have a duel between your protagonist and antagonist.The problem is that you don’t bring a knife to a gun fight in the modern era, let alone in the future. There’s a reason why our weapon technology developed in such a way to value efficiency over anything else.If a (magic) shield is discovered that can stop projectiles, this would lead to an arms race to create more powerful weapons and ways to disable the shield. It does not make sense that two combatants would instead resort back to melee weapons, which is an undesireable situation for both.Guns are also far easier to use than melee weapons, hence it is more efficient to equip large armies with them. Sure, melee weapons do have their uses, for example for concealed carrying. A knife will likely never get out of fashion. But why would you use a melee weapon in a war?And when sci-fi movies do include guns, they often look a lot like the weapons we use today and even use conventional bullets. Like this modified Bushmaster ACR from the movie Oblivion.I would like to see more sci-fi movies that drop this trope and dare to come up with creative weapon designs. And where it’s okay that the protagonist just shoots the bad guy or nukes him from orbit. We don’t always need a dragged-out melee fight.EDIT: Several people are coming up with counterarguments such as ‘most people in Star Wars use blasters’, ‘many people in Star Trek use phasers’, and so on. That is not my point.My point is that there’s a trope where the hero and the bad guy fight it out using melee weapons. It’s okay that this happens in, say, a James Bond movie, but it’s unrealistic when it happens so often in science-fiction.","4,094 followers",Damien Leimbach,897,1.4K,18.7M,https://www.quora.com/What%E2%80%99s-one-inaccuracy-in-a-science-fiction-movie-that-drives-you-crazy

If, as Magento constantly claims, humans have evolved, then we need to take a closer look at the science of evolution.In reality, evolution is a painfully slow process. We’re talking hundreds of thousands of years, maybe even millions, before any species develop enough of an evolutionary change that it can be classified as a new species.

I guess we can’t be sure, but we’re 99 percent certain that that wouldn’t happen in real life. In the movie, the ship then emerges from a white hole (the opposite of a black hole) and everyone is just fine.5. Total Recall – Exploding HumansThis classic Arnold Schwarzenegger sci-fi/action movieIn reality, a human stuck on the surface of Mars without the protection of a spacesuit or some sort of biodome wouldn’t expand and pop like a balloon. The reality is that Mars is basically freezing at all times, and even the temperature at the equator on a sunny Summer day, when the planet is at its closest orbit point to the sun, the temperature only gets to about 20 Celsius. When not in direct sunlight (or in any other season), the red planet plunges to -75 C and can get as cold as -125 C. In those conditions, frostbite, and hypothermia would kick in almost immediately. Hypoxia (a lack of oxygen in the bloodstream) would start within a minute or so. You would simultaneously freeze and suffocate in a matter of minutes. No exploding faces, though.4. Independence Day – Those Ships Were Too BigForget about the more commonly cited scientific problem withDirector Ronald Emmerich wanted to give audiences an “OMG” moment when he first revealed the ships that planted themselves over New York, L.A., Washington D.C., and other major cities around the world. There are two scientific problems with how huge they are, though. First, they would massively mess with gravity, since they are large enough to have their gravitational pull. Secondly, those ships probably still killed a bunch of people even after the humans figured out how to destroy them. All that ship has to crash land somewhere, and since the ships hovered over major urban centers, the death toll from “winning” the war was probably still in the tens (or hundreds) of millions.3. Outbreak – The Virus Would Kill Too Quickly, Plus Inoculations Take YearsWhileDustin Hoffman saves the day in the end, finding the original host animal (a cute capuchin monkey) and quickly using her antibodies to produce a cure. It made for a thrilling conclusion to the film, but it was hardly based on reality. If a virus like the fictional Motaba illness hit a town, there would be no need to quarantine everyone or execute a firebomb plan to irradiate all traces of the virus — everyone would be dead without 36-48 hours anyway.Additionally, even if a cure was eventually found, these types of medical processes take months (and even years) of time to produce. Dustin Hoffman wouldn’t be hacking it together with the blood of a lost monkey, just in the nick of time.2. Lucy – We Already Use 100 Percent of Our BrainsIn 2014, Scarlett Johansson starred inIn reality, humans do use more than 10 percent of brains, they just use different portions of it for different tasks. The brain activity for remembering things from your childhood is different than the brain activity when you are working out or sleeping, for example. If a human uses 100 percent of their brain at once, they would likely fall into an instant coma and probably end up dead. If1. The Day After Tomorrow – Almost EverythingUnless you’re one of those crazy people who don’t believe that climate change is a real thing, it’s pretty obvious that the Earth’s environment is slowly changing. But when we say changes, we mean very gradual changes. Yes, the average temperatures are rising, but in decimal points of a degree. Yes, the water levels are rising faster than ever before, but it’s still a very slow process. Unless you find yourself in the 2004 disaster filmHowever, scientists know that ice ages take millions and millions of years to develop. They don’t stroll in with a snowy Northern hurricane over a weekend. One thing that the movie did get exactly right, though, was right-wing politicians dismissing climate change as some sort of liberal hoax.

You know those scenes. The ones where there are one or more planets looming as massive screen-consuming entities in the sky. Obviously, this is done for cinematic and visual effect, but it completely detracts from any semblance of realism.In reality the distance between stable planets and moons is quite far and this comes down to the Roche limit, which essentially describes that there’s a minimum distance that two bodies can be near each other before one or both objects are torn apart by gravity and internal tidal forces.This image taken from NASA’s OSIRIS-REx spacecraft shows the distance between Earth and the Moon for example and their actual scales.To be fair, the moon was actually closer to Earth in the distant past but even at its original formation distance it’d still make sci-fi movie depictions of planetary and moon relationships laughable.Sci-fi video games are guilty of this well. In fact I’ve worked on some that are guilty of this and this is one of those details that really gets under my skin. I know I’m probably in the minority here.

Can no one honestly find a use for shit likeAnd don’t even get me started on Ant-Man.

Usually to giveThe Space Cruiser’s shields have collapsed! The energy torpedo smashes its bridge, explosions tear it in two… and it falls out of the sky like an aeroplane. Seriously?!An alien culture which is actually just a thinly veiled, and often stereotypical version of some facet of human culture. Vikings in space, or Samurai in space, or Hippies in space, and so on.Aliens resembling beings from mythology or folklore. Bonus points if they’re not just drawing inspiration, but ripping them off point-blank and even claiming they’re the reason the mythology exists.Even though we know technological progress abets technological progress, and advancements can be extremely rapid groups with sufficiently advanced technology are usually depicted as extremely ancient, and vice versa. If it took humans a hundred thousand years to go from the Palaeolithic to the Neolithic, but only four thousand years from the Neolithic to the Information Age there’s no reason to assume a race needs to be tens of millions of years old in order to have technology that dwarfs ours.… the more they stay the same. The problems of the future are the problems of today. Sometimes thinly pre-packaged, but sometimes without even a false veneer of pretence. Also it’s the year 3400, but fashion has remained more or less consistent, textiles haven’t advanced in the slightest, and women are still wearing painted on makeup.… but the Galaxy is your backyard. The heroes ship can travel across the galaxy, or the quadrant in day but nobody ever travels to other galaxies or quadrants. Conveniently travelling across an entire galaxy would be impossible without some way to compress physical distances, and if you can do that then what’s stopping you from crossing the universe in the same time frame?Because the edge of the galaxy often represents the magically pre-ordained border of the setting in its entirety (see above) anything ‘from beyond!’ must be extra-super alien (as opposed to y’know, regular aliens which are just human stereotypes in alien drag, see above) and extra-super scary.The use of this maxim to explain why technology can violate the laws of time and space betrays a profound misunderstanding of what it actually means. The worst is when a genius scientist or some other highly educated character invokes it in-universe because it instantly makes them look like an imbecile.Evolution used to explain a race with magical super-powers like telepathy or precognition. Bonus points if they’ve evolved ‘beyond the need for physical bodies,’ which is such a fantastically huge oxymoron I don’t even know where to begin. Aside from these instances though it seems races can exists for billions of years without changing, or changing themselves in the slightest. The latter example being much more likely, indeed almost a certainty for any technologically advanced race. The X-men are the worst offender here though for just sodomising the concept of evolution. Please, tell me, please, how does the slow process of physiologically adapting to one’s environment through natural selection over the course of countless generations produce beings with an unlimited selection of infinitely variable magic powers? Powers that could not possibly have a physiological origin and quite frequently break the laws of physics (and common sense) to boot?Any group which attempts to greatly increase their lifespan, slow ageing, remove disabilities and y’know do other good things with technology invariably pays a horrible price. Never mind that human beings have been doing all of these things freely and will continue to do so, and get way better at them, and it is really unlikely to lead to anything horrible in contrast to the unimaginably vast amounts of good it achieves.Unrealistic power sources abound. Like, how can Superman possibly achieve the feats he does being solar powered once we take the inverse square law into account? He should barely be able to charge a car battery let alone punch planets out of orbit. Or how come the machines can derive power from human bodies in The Matrix? Keeping human bodies aliveThen we have folks like Batman and Captain America whose power is explicitly stated to not be super-human, but that of a ‘peak human.’ The thing is if you’re as strong as a champion power lifter, as agile as an Olympic gymnast, as fast as a world-class sprinter, and as hardy as a marathon runner you’re super-human",6 followers,Sarah McLean,2.3K,5.7K,12.3M,https://www.quora.com/What%E2%80%99s-one-inaccuracy-in-a-science-fiction-movie-that-drives-you-crazy

This is calledBecause you are still in the dream stage, not only are you awake and unable to move, but you can also experience hallucinations, which are really just dreams from your still-in-REM sleep brain.This can be very startling when it happens to people who have never heard of sleep paralysis, but if you are familiar with what it is, there is absolutely nothing to be afraid of.I have actually experienced very fascinating and pleasant hallucinations, but I will save the stories for another post in the future.(2) You have a “second brain” in your gut called the enteric nervous system.The enteric nervous system consists of a network of neurons within the abdominal cavity. It spans from the esophagus to the colon and consists of more neurons than there are located in the spinal cord.The enteric nervous system controls the entire digestive system, as well as regulating hormones. It plays a major role in our emotions and behavior by communicating with the central nervous system via the vagus nerve.Surprisingly, it can even function without receiving signals from the brain. The digestive system would continue performing its tasks as usual even if the vagus nerve were severed.Because the enteric nervous system independently controls so many different functions, it is often referred to as the “second brain”.You have probably heard the phrases “gut feeling” and “butterflies in the stomach”. These distinct feelings are a result of the enteric nervous system releasing hormones.(3) About every five years, all the atoms in your body get replaced.This can lead to some interesting and perplexing questions.What makes youIt cannot be your memories, opinions, or personality that make you who you are, because those things also change.This leads us to a paradox analogous to this problem, a paradox known as theSuppose there is a ship whose planks are replaced one at a time over the course of a few years. How many planks have to be replaced before it is no longer the same ship?After all the planks are replaced, what if all the old planks are used to build another ship which is identical to the other? IsNow apply this paradox to humans. What if every atom that was in your body five years ago were rearranged to make another body just like yoursWhich one would be you?That should give you something to think about.Sourceshttp://www.psyking.net/id36.htmhttps://www.boundless.com/physiology/textbooks/boundless-anatomy-and-physiology-textbook/digestive-system-23/nervous-system-of-the-digestive-system-217/enteric-nervous-system-1068-8858/",925 followers,Ty Malden,1.5K,81,1.4M,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-most-useful-tools-every-programmer-should-have

Lol: Read on!Picture a clitoris in your mind. Got it? Now, what if I told you that what you're imagining is just the tip of an iceberg and there is a whole lot of clitoral goodness hidden inside a treasure chest ( pelvis). The clitoris is only partially visible to the naked eye. Yes, the clitoris is actually close to four inches in length (the average non-erect penis) but three-fourths of it is hidden from view within a female’s body. It's buried a treasure. and, when erect, it actually wraps around the vagina –making the vagina and sex more pleasurable for the man and the woman as the woman gets more excited.The scientific name for the external ""little button"" or “cherry pit” or “joy buzzer“ or ""bulb"" [of the clitoris] isMost women do not have an orgasm through intercourse alone. They think they are abnormal. You aren’t abnormal. You are not alone, 50 to 75 percent of women who have orgasms need to have their clitoris touched (clitoral stimulation).When does Clitoris stop growing?Clitoris gets better with age like old wine. The clitoris grows throughout a woman's life. Hormonal changes lead to the clitoris growing over the course of a woman’s life. The onset of puberty initiates the increase in size. After menopause, the clitoris can become 2.5 times larger than it was when the same woman was a teenager and 7 times bigger than it was at birth. That could be the reason why some women have stronger orgasms in mid-life and into their sixties and beyond. Go the older women!! Women who have given birth tend to have larger clitorises – the longest ever measured was 12""!What happens if women use anabolic steroids? Do the clitoris grows into a penis? Yes, women who take anabolic steroids actually grow their clitorises to look like mini penises. (What?!!)Word of caution: Apparently, the clitoris can get mad at you and disappear. If the clitoris goes unused, it will retreat into the body and the hood will fuse closed, known as clitoral atrophy. You don’t want that to happen, do you? So, use it or lose it. Just like every other tissue in the body, the clitoris requires blood flow to stay happy and healthy. So whatever you do – give your clitoris some love.The clitoris contains about 8,000 sensitive nerve endings, nearly double the nerve endings in the glans of a penis and more than anywhere else in the entire human body. It is highly sensitive, some like it touched gently and some like a little more pressure. Even after having so many nerve endings —Yet more women struggle with the ability to reach orgasm than men do.. and so many times they just fake an orgasm -hmm why?Men and women are more alike than we are different. Did you know that all babies male and female have the exact same genital tissue when they are conceived? During the development phase (Around 12 weeks) in the mother’s womb, each baby’s genitalia begins to differentiate into a penis in a boy or labia in a girl. The clitoris and penis come from the same embryonic tissue but they are just organised in a different way. The clitoris has glans, a foreskin( aka the hood), erectile tissue, and a tiny shaft: all the parts that a penis has. It even swells when it's aroused similar to a penis.Only one-quarter of the clitoris is visible. The rest of the treasure is safely buried inside. I know we talked about it, just making sure it has sunken into your brain.Clitoris is made up theThe clitoris is designed to bring a woman pleasure. That is its sole purpose. A woman has four erogenous zones inside and around the vagina that connect with and stimulate the clitoris. 1. The tip of the clitoris (or C-spot), 2. G-spot and the lesser known 3. A spot and 4. U-spot.For now we know that Reproduction isn’t the purpose of clitoris. But, again We don’t know a whole lot of things about the human body.Did you know that there are different kinds of orgasms: Vaginal, Cervical, and G Spot Orgasms etc, exist, but the easiest is a clitoral orgasm. Yes, there are so many kinds of orgasms. Very few women are able to achieve an orgasm without any kind of clitoral stimulation/ involvement. Some of the ladies have orgasms only through your clitoris.The clitoris varies in size and shape on different women. Some are hidden under the hood, and some pop out. Clitoris is a little complicated than you guys think. Please don't assume that you know what the clitoris likes. No, it definitely doesn’t like to be hit like an elevator button. Take your time and get to know the unique glorious clitoris, each one is special and different and has its own temper and individuality. it’s as important as knowing the woman that it is attached to. (If you don’t understand it, then your woman’s clitoris would just die out of boredom being with you)A clitoral orgasm can bring about anywhere between 3-16 contractions and can last from 10-30 seconds. Also, many women have multiple orgasms that can include pelvic contractions.An average clitoral orgasm lasts longer than even the best male orgasm! Male and female orgasm have been compared and they found out that even the most average clitoral orgasm lasted longer than even the very best ever and most fantastic male orgasm, yeah, Go women! We have the longest orgasms! And the reason could be that women have more nerve endings in the clitoris.Women are able to experience multiple orgasms. Okay, we have the longer orgasms and MULTIPLE orgasms!! Can that get any better? It must suck to be a man. Sorry guys! Most women are likely capable of this because women, unlike men, usually don’t have a waiting period upon reaching orgasm. They can go on and on and on and on, probably you would die of exhaustion giving it to her. The most orgasms documented in one hour is a whopping 134 for a woman and *just* 16 for a man. Take that!!Did you know that the word ""Clitoris"" is from the Greek word for ""key""? Oooh, a key to unlock all the female's pleasures and much more.When the distance between a woman’s clitoris and her vaginal opening is less than the width of her thumb, she is more likely to reach orgasm during intercourse. Why? Because the glorious clitoris receives more indirect stimulation without the need for added clitoral stimulation because it is closer to the action.Does a clitoris Ages? NO. It stays the same, no matter the wear and tear, it maintains its pleasure capacity. So you can have the same mind-boggling orgasms at 100 years old as you did as a teenager. Don’t ever feel sad or inferior comparing yourself to an younger woman, You still can orgasm better than a teenager!It is important to teach young people about their bodies which enables them to learn what feels and looks normal and what is abnormal. So many young people think that they are abnormal because they don’t know what’s normal.Source: Read books, and was also taught at sex Ed,Image source: Google.",63 followers,Kaushal Karna,833,0,0,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-most-useful-tools-every-programmer-should-have

82,"Amazing facts about# Skin Facts 1: Why different races have different skin colors?The fact is almost millions of years ago,all the human race were black in color, residing in tropical regions near equator. Black skin color denotes higher concentration of melanin (black pigment) under the skin which gives protection from harmful sun rays. As people started migrating towards the cooler northern regions, the requirement of sun protection decreased and hence skin produced lesser melanin and hence white complexion. Therefore races residing in tropical climate are darker complexioned and thoseAmazing facts about# Skin Facts 1: Why different races have different skin colors?The fact is almost millions of years ago,all the human race were black in color, residing in tropical regions near equator. Black skin color denotes higher concentration of melanin (black pigment) under the skin which gives protection from harmful sun rays. As people started migrating towards the cooler northern regions, the requirement of sun protection decreased and hence skin produced lesser melanin and hence white complexion. Therefore races residing in tropical climate are darker complexioned and those in cooler regions are fair because of natural adaptation of the skin to the environmental conditions.# Skin Facts 2: It would take a 100 generation for a race to change its skin colorIf a black race shifts to a cooler climate or a white race person shifts to a tropical climate, it would take them 100 generations to change their color to adapt to the local environment. So if a black shifts to Arctic, after a 100 generation his family would be as white as snow…..# Skin Facts 3 : Why women are fairer than men in all races?Did you notice that too?? The science behind this hypothesizes that since women need more calcium and Vitamin D than men to help them tide through pregnancy, lactation and menopause, they were made light skinned. Its so because light skin absorbs more sunlight than dark skin. More sunlight leads to more Vitamin D production and in turn more calcium absorption…. Many a times I think that nature is brilliant….What do you say??# Skin Facts 4: Stay a little dirty to be healthyA shocker again? This is a famous “hygiene hypothesis” which says that exposure to harmless pathogens (bacteria, viruses, dust particles) in the early years of life is good for the bodies immunity. It helps in strengthening our immune system and reduces the chances of allergy and asthma. This is the reason why the incidence of asthma and allergy is on a rise in urban population compared to rural ones, cause in the cities we are more particular about our hygiene and cleanliness compared to rural population. It is also said that since we had joint families in past, there were too many children under one roof and there was a high chance of cross over infection….this made the immunity of kids robust.Now with nuclear families and lesser kids, the rate of transfer of harmless infection has decreased and hence our immunity is not as strong as older days. So let your child play with little dirt…let him soil his hands..It will help him grow better both physically and mentally.# Skin Facts 5: You have at least a 1000 bacterial species on your skin at any given time.Don’t feel dirty….we have millions of “good bacteria” residing on our skin. They are an important part of skin defense against other harmful pathogens…So let them live happily on you and they will be your faithful protector.# Skin Facts 6: You shed off your skin every 28 daysSounds weird?? “We never see our skin shedding”….. That’s because our skin does not change its cover in entirety like snakes but we do shed our skin cells, at least 30,000-40,000 cells every minute. Shocked?? These cells are so microscopic that its hard to see them shed but its said that much of the dust in your house is because of these dead cells. Our skin cell has a life span of 28 days, they grow, age and die in 28 days and get replaced by new cells. So technically we have new skin every month!!# Skin Facts 7: Like fingerprints, you have unique tongue prints tooIt can be a creative idea for the next James Bond Movie Like we have a unique fingerprint, we also have unique tongue print Did you know there are few families in the world, whose members don’t have fingerprints at all….they have a condition called adermatoglyphia. Till 2001 only 5 such families had been reported in our medical literature. They have no other disorder apart from no fingerprints….although in some other medical conditions like Naegeli’s syndrome, the fingerprints are absent, but they also have many other disorders besides fingerprint loss. Want to write a new mystery novel…go for this idea!!# Skin Facts 8: Goose bumps are actually muscle contractions.Our hair is attached with a single muscle to the skin. Whenever we are in a very cold environment or we have some strong emotional feeling, this muscle contracts and pulls the hair which appears straight and taut.Source:Image source : GoogleThanks :)EDIT :EDIT 2:As far back as the 1960s, the biochemist W. Farnsworth Loomis had suggested that skin color is determined by the body's need for vitamin D. The vitamin helps the body absorb calcium and deposit it in bones, an essential function, particularly in fast-growing embryos. (The need for vitamin D during pregnancy may explain why women around the globe tend to have lighter skin than men.) Unlike folate, vitamin D depends on ultraviolet light for its production in the body. Loomis believed that people who live in the north, where daylight is weakest, evolved fair skin to help absorb more ultraviolet light and that people in the tropics evolved dark skin to block the light, keeping the body from overdosing on vitamin D, which can be toxic at high concentrations.For more knowledge : Evolution : Library : The Biology of Skin Color : Black and White - PBSPBS: Public Broadcasting Service",10 followers,Ankita Parmar Kheradiya,1.7K,0,0,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-most-useful-tools-every-programmer-should-have

119,"Between most of your flexible joints, there is a space, filled with synovial fluid, secreted and surrounded by synovial membrane. So there's an entire closed compartment between two bones filled with synovial fluid. The synovial fluid consists of various gases dissolved in it. Now, whenever you crack your joints, there is an increase in space between the bones, increase in the volume of the synovial compartment, which causes decrease in the pressure of synovial fluid and when pressure inside a fluid drops, the gases trapped inside it bBetween most of your flexible joints, there is a space, filled with synovial fluid, secreted and surrounded by synovial membrane. So there's an entire closed compartment between two bones filled with synovial fluid. The synovial fluid consists of various gases dissolved in it. Now, whenever you crack your joints, there is an increase in space between the bones, increase in the volume of the synovial compartment, which causes decrease in the pressure of synovial fluid and when pressure inside a fluid drops, the gases trapped inside it become less soluble or become undissolved, forming bubbles.So the pop which you actually hear is the sound of formation of bubbles inside the synovial fluid.The bubbles can also be seen in an X-ray right after you crack a joint.Myopia is caused because of change in the shape of your eyeball and you cant correct it just by eating or applying stuff on your eyeball or doing some yogic exercise. It is just required in small quantities to prevent its deficiency.Ever noticed why only one of your nostrils becomes stuffy or congested especially in sinusitis and cold. Actually, one of your nostrils is always partially blocked because of swelling of an internal structure in your nose called turbinate(refer to the picture above) from inside. This is to divide the workload and to enhance the sensation of smell.Effect on workload:The air which passes through the nostrils is dry and cold and hence needs to be made moist and warm for better exchange in the lungs. However, too much of this can cause drying up of your nasal passages and damage to cilia(hair like projections which help in trapping foreign particles). Hence the swelling of the nostril causes decreased air passage in that nostril and decreased workload. They switch this several times in a day. This is called nasal cycle and is controlled by autonomic nervous system.Effect on sensation of smell:When certain chemicals in the air come in contact with the smell receptors in your nostrils, sensation of smell is produced. However, some of these chemicals are sticky and hence in order to reach the back of your nose where the receptors are located, they have to travel fast to prevent their sticking before reaching the receptors. The other chemicals which require more time to stick to the receptors, travel slowly becuase of patency of airway passage in the other nostril. Hence, the odours which cannot be properly detected by one nostril can be detected by the other and vice versa.Many people think that wifi and cell phone radiations are harmful, can cause cancer and stuff. But that's not possible cause these radiations aren't ionizing radiations. Ionizing radiations are the only radiations which can cause changes in your DNA, causing mutations and cancer.Called as punctate leukonychia or milk spots. There are many myths about these like some say it's because of calcium deficiency or zinc deficiency. Neither of these are true.They are usually a sign of trauma which mostly must have been caused when you unintentionally bumped your nails to something like a desk or biting of nails caused due to interruption in the formation of nail cells from the matrix and is absolutely normalInside chilli peppers, there's a chemical compound called capsaicin that produces a violent, burning sensation when it comes in contact with human tissues.Capsaicin has non-polar molecules in it, which can only dissolve with other non-polar molecules. Water is made of polar molecules, which means not only will it not provide a cooling effect—even if it’s in ice form—it actually spreads the capsaicin molecules around, making your mouth feel even hotter. It's like mixing oil and water.So next time to you bite off more spice than you can chew, try to get a glass of milk or other dairy product like yoghurt, cheese etcSources:SciShowFox NewsDNewsImage courtesy:","74,683 followers",Tiny Nair,3.2K,689,27.9M,https://www.quora.com/What%E2%80%99s-one-inaccuracy-in-a-science-fiction-movie-that-drives-you-crazy
