He has also created a fund that has donated billions of dollars to various causes around the world.Jeff Bezos built the first online market place turning it into a high-tech platform that has changed forever the way people shop. His business model has been emulated by many including Russia’s Wildberries and Ozon.Unsatisfied with his achievements, Bezos has funded a private space company and and became the second person to reach suborbital space aboard his all-civilian rocket ship.The first person was another oligarch Sir Richard Branson who had followed on the footsteps of his English predecessors to fund a scientific project for the benefit of the mankind.Roman Abramovich is the ‘best’ oligarch Russia has produced in 30 years. He unlike the rest of the Russian oligarchs, at least donates his money to various causes. Roman is our Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates rolled into one.Roman didn’t build any high-tech company. He didn’t send any rocket to space. He bought for pennies assets of the Soviet oil industry and then through cunning schemes enriched himself beyond any measure and kept his riches by becoming Putin’s agent of influence in London.Roman recently bought his 6th super-yacht for half a billion dollars. It is a marvel of German engineering and Italian design. Not a single part was manufactured in Russia.Now try not to laugh. According to Roman, his greatest achievement in life has been….Football Club Chelsea he purchased in 2004!Yes, the pinnacle of Russia’s most prominent oligarch’s life achievements was to have eleven grownup men wearing shorts run around a lawn with a leather ball. 🙉This is another half a billion super-yacht of another good for nothing Russian oligarch Mordashov who had leached off Soviet extraction industry and ‘forgot’ to share with his compatriots. No, the super-yacht was not built in Russia either. It couldn’t have.And look at the city of Cherepovets, the source of his wealth.Mordashov hasn’t invested a penny into it. He does not care to bring his Soviet steel mills to modern ecological standards that look like a set from a dystopian movie.Mordashov doesn’t dabble in science. He didn’t creat any space company. He enjoys his luxurious lifestyle like his predecessors and to hell with the serfs who live hand to mouth.According to Noam Chomsky, “Education is learning to spot signs of history repeating itself”. As such, Russians are not an educated people.They must have been put on Earth to give a valuable lesson how NOT to live one’s life.Be thankful that there is Russia, the idiot of the world.","43,142 followers",Misha Firer,1K,1.3K,132.5M,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-images-that-make-you-feel-grateful

We were not able to afford such things in our life. An International trip was a dream!We had a snack quota of 5 Indian rupees, every evening. I used to go in the evening to buy snacks for me and my elder sister using that 5 rupees. I still remember, one day, I got something for 6 rupees. It was 1 rupee more than what we were supposed to use. I bought it along with other groceries and went back home.I was so worried I overused the money. I told my mom that I will compensate it with buying stuff for 1 rupee lesser the next day.

Did Lawrence actually say those words anywhere, in his writings? Did someone overhear him say it?

This is known by prison officials, who recognize that the worst torture they can give to a prisoner is solitary confinement. Depriving the prisoner of interaction with murderers and rapists is considered punishment. Yet some people prefer loneliness. My father-in-law lived in the wilderness, essentially alone except for brief hikes to a store to buy flour and lard , for two decades.Loneliness has a cure, but it is not always easy.

But I refused to die. I made a silent pledge: That I will prove Mengele wrong, that I will survive, and I will be reunited with Miriam.For the next two weeks I was between life and death. I have only one memory - crawling on the barrack floor, because I no longer could walk. There was a faucet on the other end of the barrack. As I was crawling, I would fade in and out of consciousness. I just kept thinking,When my son had cancer, I couldn't get him to accept the fact that he had to fight for his life, thatThe fact that I have overcome so much adversity in my life helps me to have hope during tough times. I believe if I could survive Auschwitz, if I could survive crawling on the barrack floor between life and death, I could probably survive anything. Basically that is the way we gain confidence in our ability. When we overcome one difficulty and one hardship, we can build on that when any other hardship comes along in life. I also like the fact that people who hear me speak  can tune in and feel inspired. They see that I could do it, and they realize they can overcome whatever they are trying to overcome too. That is helpful to realize, that maybe each of us can help others overcome by sharing our stories.You can also look for ideas on YouTube and the Internet for people who have overcome tough times. You will find a story that fits your situation. Then when you are inspired, DO something. Make a commitment to yourself. Make a promise and keep it close by. If you get off track, don’t feel guilty - we all do it. Just get right back on it.",3 followers,Geetanjali Singh,14.3K,95,3.9M,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-images-that-make-you-feel-grateful

They are trusted with driving multi billion dollar naval vessels at that age and experience level with equipment that’s positively Stone Age compared to a galaxy class starship in the 24th century.

It can also raise an error to the operating system if the program reads or writes to an address that it doesn’t have mapped.So the operating system decides where in physical RAM space the program will be loaded and when the program is set running, it’ll use the MMU to map that memory into the addresses starting at 0x0000 up to as much memory as it asked for when loaded.So once the MMU is turned on, the C program THINKS it can see all of memory - but because the blocks it accesses are only the ones that the operating system has assigned to it, it cannot overwrite the space being used by other programs - or by the operating system itself without causing the MMU to flag an error to the operating system…which will typically cause it to “crash” the program.The result is that every program on the computer THINKS it’s seeing memory running from address zero upwards - but in fact it’ll be accessing some blocks of physical RAM that could be anywhere within the RAM of the computer.This also allows some additional tricks.SHARING PROGRAM SPACE:The MMU also allows the operating system to flag certain blocks of RAM as being “read only” - and then the MMU will flag an error if the program tries to write to it.This allows you to do things like running multiple copies of the same program - but with the parts of the program’s RAM that are machine code instructions being set “read only”. You can then have the two copies of the program share the program’s code - while each has it’s own copy of the data.SHARED DATA SPACE:There are yet cleverer tricks where two copies of a program can even share RAM space for variables and such - with the MMU detecting if one copy of the program changes a “shared” RAM block - then it’ll make a copy of it and map it back into the right place.SWAPPING:Another trick is that if the operating system runs out of memory, it can copy some of the physical RAM blocks out onto the disk drive - and mark them as blocked in the MMU. Now, another program can use that memory. When the program tries to access the blocked-off RAM, the MMU triggers a message to the operating system which finds a free block of RAM, restores the data from the hard drive and maps that block back into the correct place in the program using the MMU.The program runs perfectly, having no idea that a chunk of the memory it thought it owned has be shunted off onto the hard drive!Since hard drives are VERY large, this enables you to run programs that are bigger than the actual amount of RAM in your machine.The snag is, with all of this copying back and forth to disk, the program will run dog-slow.CONCLUSION:The MMU is the “unsung hero” that really makes sophisticated operating systems possible.But on a super-cheap machine that’s only intended to run one program at a time, then you don’t need an MMU, and C programs can read and write to any byte in memory.","1,725 followers",Heath Weaver,2.5K,471,4M,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-images-that-make-you-feel-grateful
