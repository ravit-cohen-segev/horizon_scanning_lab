And today, we will explore other parts where Blockchain is giving extraordinary results.Supply Chain ManagementIn the supply chain management department, Blockchain solution technology defines the meaning of cost-effectiveness. Blockchain helps trace the movement of goods, their origin, the quantity of the product, and so on. This clarifies B2B ecosystems where their product has reached and if it is safe and intact. In short, Blockchain solutions simplify processes such as ownership transfer, production process assurance, and payments.Quality AssuranceQuality assurance is a crucial part. And blockchain Lms play an even more significant role in enhancing the entire process along the supply chain. A blockchain system leads you to the point of origin, eventually making it easier for businesses to analyze. For instance: in the food sector, blockchain LMS can assist in tracking the source of the product, batch information, and other details necessary for quality assurance and safety.VotingThe voting system has been an issue of concern for almost every country worldwide. Blockchain has also managed to create a pattern of trust and value in the voting system. Currently, governments in different parts of the world are exploring different ways blockchain solutions can be integrated to create more efficient voting methods.There are other sectors where blockchain solutions are changing, such as healthcare, stock exchange, energy supply, and others.",2 followers,Kelly Pearson,1.7K,0,0,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-advantages-of-blockchain-outside-of-cryptocurrencies

Though of course it is by no means guaranteed that it will be around for generations to come, and really we can’t be more sure of that until it actually starts getting adopted for spending by the mass market, which will probably happen gradually over the next decade, with the Lightning Network likely being the catalyst for that.It’s unlikely another crypto will takes its place, and it has a use case that nothing else outside of crypto provides.

7,I wish I knew. People who make bets on these things and are correct make a bundle if they’re wrong they lose much as bettors do in Las Vegas. Instead of trying to time the market you could employ an investment strategy that works for you. One way to offset risk is with time. The longer your investment horizon the easier it is to ride out the bumps. More than five years let’s you invest more into equities. Maybe invest at a steady pace so during downturns your money buys more and in upturns you’re making money on what you’ve already invested and keep some cash handy to invest during extra big dI wish I knew.

Diversification helps too by asset class but too much and your investments become diluted. Be wary of some mutual funds. The fees and the way they’re treated for taxes can kill you.Good investing is difficult because it’s counterintuitive to what we feel. When the market tanks we get scared and want to sell yet that’s a great time to buy. When the market is up we what to buy more yet it might be a good time to take some profits. It was difficult but I put money into the market in 2008 and it has worked out well.Buy low and sell high sounds easier than it actually is to do.,326 followers,Anubhav Jain,2.9K,4.4K,123.3M,https://www.quora.com/What-do-we-know-about-the-Tesla-Pi-phone

We call this an “inverted yield curve” because short-term yields pay more than long-term, which is a weird situation.This indicator is so ubiquitous, that the Federal Reserve Bank of New York publishes a monthly “recession indicator” on their website. You can access it for free:UNEMPLOYMENT RATEAnother indicator to watch is the headline unemployment rate relative to its 12-month moving average. While this is a noisy indicator, when the rate crosses above its MA, you should be checking your dashboard closely for other things which may signal a slowdown. It is easy to see that unemployment tends to tick up about 10–12 months prior to an official recession.Currently the UER looks okay. No klaxon sounding here.…And that’s all I’m gonna give you…I’d recommend doing lots of research, though, to build your own dashboard of indicators. But that is only half the equation—you’ll need a process to understand what you need to do when you get red blinky lights and klaxons going off!Only with a cohesive strategy should you put money at risk. If you don't have one, build one or pay someone who has one you like.—This is not investment advice. I am just a guy answering a question on the internet.

9,"One of my former executives made a great analogy of financial crises: You can compare this to an earthquake in the SF Bay area. You know it’s going to happen, but you don’t know the exact moment and you don’t know the exact magnitude.The same goes for financial crises. There is tension building in markets, but when and how it will release is uncertain.But how do we know tension is building?, you might ask.For years the central banks (FED, ECB) have been giving away free money.One of my former executives made a great analogy of financial crises: You can compare this to an earthquake in the SF Bay area.

There is tension building in markets, but when and how it will release is uncertain.But how do we know tension is building?, you might ask.For years the central banks (FED, ECB) have been giving away free money.Since the central banks cannot continue to give away free money, interest rates have to rise. This will have downward pressure on the currently issued (low rate) bonds.But it’s unlikely the stock market will benefit from this change, with the increase of interest rates corporate loans (either public traded or obtained from banks) will be more expensive as well. Money will be more expensive to obtain.Is there a safe place? Sure, there is one extremely safe investment, but it has a backdraw: cash.Timing is everything and everybody gets it wrong.But, given what we know from previous dips in the market: over time the market recovers. If you have plenty of time you can keep your investments, have the dip carve away some value and the rise up recover it.I can’t advice you, but now at least you know where the market is heading and based on your portfolio make some assessments of your actual risk.",793 followers,Patrick Bendahan,779,476,1.2M,https://www.quora.com/What-do-we-know-about-the-Tesla-Pi-phone
10,"I think that a crisis in the near future is inevitable. Let’s look at the historic record:Ronald Reagan enacts tax cuts for the rich, and deregulates the financial markets. Because tax cuts for the rich create deficits in the revenue needed to meet the obligations the government already has, Reagan raised taxes 11 times…on the Working Class. Simultaneously, he went on a military spending spree, all of which was funded by raising the national debt (deficit spending).Economic recession was the result.GW (War President) Bush enacts tax cuts for the rich and deregulates financial markets.

Simultaneously, he went on a military spending spree, all of which was funded by raising the national debt (deficit spending).Economic recession was the result.GW (War President) Bush enacts tax cuts for the rich and deregulates financial markets. Budget deficits are the predictable result. Instead of raising taxes, Bush just borrows the money to pay for the shortage which of course, adds to the National Debt. And he starts two unjustifiable wars, enormously costly, all of which is also added to the national debt.The worst financial collapse since the Great Depression of the 1930s, is the result.Trump enacts tax cuts for the rich. As expected, those tax cuts for the rich increase the National Debt by $1.5 Trillion or so. This in addition to a huge increase in our already bloated and unjustifiable military budget, is skyrocketing the National Debt to roughly $2 Trillion!!!!The economic disaster has not yet materialized, but it really doesn’t take a rocket scientist to figure out that policies that have produced economic catastrophe every time they have been implemented in the past, will have exactly the same results in the present.The definition of insanity is doing the same thing, but expecting different results. We are a nation of economic illiterates. Economic collapse and catastrophe as a result of Trump’s repetition of Reagan and Bush economic policies, is absolutely inevitable.

11,"It depends on the crisis.A stock market crash represents the best opportunity for the average person to get rich. When prices are low, people can invest and the stock market has always come back. This is why dollar cost averaging is such an excellent strategy.But to make out you have to have a pile of money you can apply, and have great courage, a penchant for risk and the ability to wait it out. If you have no money then you cannot take advantage of the opportunity. “When there is blood in the streets, buy stock” is a famous quote that couldn’t possibly be more true.

This is why dollar cost averaging is such an excellent strategy.But to make out you have to have a pile of money you can apply, and have great courage, a penchant for risk and the ability to wait it out. If you have no money then you cannot take advantage of the opportunity. “When there is blood in the streets, buy stock” is a famous quote that couldn’t possibly be more true. When people are selling, selling, selling it’s the time to buy - if you are smart and do your homework and know how to buy.When there is a collapse, the rich suffer disproportionately but they are often also the best positioned to scoop up the scraps and make money. Stock market crashes have the same critical value that forest fires have - they create the opportunity for new life and new growth in the ashes. Rich people are more likely to have assets that can be used to scoop up bargain stocks.“No one ever bet enough on a winning horse” is a oft-stated quote when it comes to stock. If you buy a 1000 shares of xyz and it goes up 1000 percent, you wont be congratulating yourself; you’ll be cursing yourself for not buying 10000 shares. This is called “greed” and you must overcome it. Know when you’ve won and WALK AWAY. In fact, there are adages in stock market circles, “Sell in May, walk away” because the stock market is almost always moribund until September. Take your gains (or losses) AND FORGET THEM. You can never dwell on success or failure of the past; no one ever got successful in the past; “Coulda, shoulda, woulda are three guys I never want to know.” Forget the past.Also, have a plan and stick to the plan. Greed is the biggest killer of all. When you make a decision to sell at “X” then sell a “X” and if it goes up, forget it, and if it goes down, forget it. FORGET IT. Dwelling on “what could have been” is the strategy of LOSERS. “It’s never too late to make a losing bet” is another analogy. You have to know your strength and what you can stomach; just because a stock goes down doesn’t mean it can’t go to zero and there’s no guarantee it will go up. Know what you want and why you want it and what you’ll tolerate for price swings.I never recommend individual stocks other than Blue Chips that pay dividend such as Johnson and Johnson. I was caught up in the US Steel bankruptcy and lost a lot of money in the early 80s. I remember my broker telling me investing in US Steel was a “no brainer”. “You’ll be in the gravy”. Even a blue chip can fail. It did. I lost a house.In a financial crisis you have to keep your head; if you’re in SP 500 Index Funds, maintain your dollar cost averaging strategy and increase your monthly contributions as much as you can; if you have individual stocks and you believe in them, then hang on to them and see if they will recover; if you have stocks you should have a Plan such that if the stock goes down “x” percent you will sell it, regardless, and take your losses because you at least preserve some capital. No matter what, have a Plan.In a financial crisis where there is a hyper inflation, then people who invest in the stock market make out because in an inflation, the stock market tends to grow faster. Again, you have to have money to make money and holding money in an inflation is a waste. It has to go somewhere and that place is the stock market since bonds won’t help you in an inflation; TIPS protected investments might help as well.In a deflation, stockpile cash and don’t buy goods - their value simply decreases over time anyway. Deflations are a self-fulfilling failure because people put off buying expecting prices to collapse even further which creates a death spiral.In the upcoming collapse, which I predict will occur between September and December, cash will be king. I recommend to everyone to start stockpiling cash. If I am wrong and the economy doesn’t collapse (and I am often wrong) then you will have a pile of cash available for other things and that’s never a bad thing; but if there is a crash, then real estate, stocks and other securities will decline in value - perhaps rapidly - and having cash is the only safe thing to have. In a financial crisis other than inflation, cash is king.",26 followers,Balaji Viswanathan,7.4K,5.6K,426.3M,https://www.quora.com/How-long-will-Bitcoin-exist
