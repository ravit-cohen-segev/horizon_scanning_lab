1,"Many areas of research might benefit from more funding but very few would benefit from a $1T per year budget. For most activities, there are real limits to scaling that mean that budget increases above a transition zone are likely to be completely wasted. That waste would take many forms but mostly it would just encourage corruption and criminality that would likely come to detract from progress.It takes at least 5 years to educate new participants in this sort of R&D enterprise and more like 10 years for leaders who set policy and make most important decisions.

Gradual but consistent increases in funding encourage more people to go into a field. Sudden massive increases in budgets just make the whole field seem like a scam and make scandalous failure very likely.Fusion in particular is not a matter of just solving problems with implementing pretty well understood technology. It wouldn’t be readily adapted to the sort of problem solving money can buy - which is building a lot of simultaneous variants and iterating rapidly.If nuclear energy is the goal, 4th and 5th generation fission reactors would be better suited to throwing money at R&D. Decades ago, Fusion was seen as the holy grail of energy because it could power human civilization for hundreds of millions of years. Fission is now capable of that. There are no longer any resource limits to Uranium which can be extracted from seawater economically and that seawater content is essentially self-renewing from uranium that leaches out of bedrock and is circulated up from deep in the earth.Fission reactors are much closer to being able to solve all important technical issues than Fusion - hence are much more susceptible to brute force development approaches. Mass produced small modular uranium fission reactors could permanently solve carbon emissions/ sustainable energy for humanity in the sense Fusion was historically fantasized to do. The anti-nuclear movement’s issues with waste or weapons production are much more easily solvable technical issues than the fundamental problems remaining with practical fusion. This wouldn’t cost anything close to $1T/year.","3,657 followers",Brent Oster,3.6K,357,1.8M,https://www.quora.com/If-all-rich-countries-of-the-world-get-together-and-allocate-10T-USD-for-fusion-research-could-we-have-a-workable-fusion-reactor-10-years-from-now
2,"No. I have learned that if an engineering project is late, throwing more money at it will just make it more late. More people come in who don’t know the project, and those who do spend all their time training the new ones instead of finishing the project. There are still many obstacles to fusion power, and we don’t even know if it is possible to overcome all of them. Once we get successful fusion power, it will still take years to commercialize it. It may never be able to compete economically with fission, wind, solar, and battery storage.",0 followers,John Holmes,814,1.2K,777.2K,https://www.quora.com/If-all-rich-countries-of-the-world-get-together-and-allocate-10T-USD-for-fusion-research-could-we-have-a-workable-fusion-reactor-10-years-from-now
3,"If you look at the numbers, Nuclear is safe and clean, in comparison to other power sources.Nothing is absolutely safe or absolutely cleanHowever, Wind and Solar are intermittent sources- so you need massive storage or grid capacity to back them up.A good capacity factor for Solar is 25% of nameplate capacity- if you want to provide 1 MW 24 hours a day, you need to build 4 MW nameplate capacity, so you generate enough excess when the sun shines.Wind can get up to 33% name plate capacity, so your 1MW always on needs 3 MW installed.Once you allow for that, Wind, Solar and Nuclear all come out veIf you look at the numbers, Nuclear is safe and clean, in comparison to other power sources.Nothing is absolutely safe or absolutely cleanHowever, Wind and Solar are intermittent sources- so you need massive storage or grid capacity to back them up.A good capacity factor for Solar is 25% of nameplate capacity- if you want to provide 1 MW 24 hours a day, you need to build 4 MW nameplate capacity, so you generate enough excess when the sun shines.Wind can get up to 33% name plate capacity, so your 1MW always on needs 3 MW installed.Once you allow for that, Wind, Solar and Nuclear all come out very similar in terms of safety.If your grid backup for your wind or Solar is say, Natural Gas, it wrecks your average green and safety ratings.As for radioactivity, that from Nuclear power is well contained. Many coal deposits contain lots of Uranium and Thorium, so are weakly radioactive- and burning the coal liberates that. Natural gas traps are Radon traps.In the month when Fukishima melted down, Japan got more radioactivity from China burning coal than it did from the meltdown.",0 followers,Joey Ortiz,17.5K,674,1.3M,https://www.quora.com/If-all-rich-countries-of-the-world-get-together-and-allocate-10T-USD-for-fusion-research-could-we-have-a-workable-fusion-reactor-10-years-from-now
4,"Pretty much. When it does the rarely unsafe thing, it is significant, but that really doesn’t happen too frequently.The main problem is that it’s expensive, and nobody wants to pay more for it, or have their taxes go to subsidies that paper over the high cost.Some amount of nuclear is probably reasonable to mitigate global warming, but it’s expensive and slow to come online. There hasn’t been a new full-size project get started and reach operation in the US since Three Mile Island in 1979.It gives financial people the willies because of the schedules and cost overruns.",454 followers,Graham Ross Leonard Cowan,12.5K,5.3K,2.2M,https://www.quora.com/If-all-rich-countries-of-the-world-get-together-and-allocate-10T-USD-for-fusion-research-could-we-have-a-workable-fusion-reactor-10-years-from-now
5,"I like to compare nuclear energy to your toilet, but that's not a bad thing, most of us decide to have toilets despite a few negatives.For years we just threw our waste into the street, or rivers, or had a big trench at the edge of the village. Our waste was all around us and impacted daily life, not only the smell but also the health impacts. That's like traditional fossil fuels, they are easy but dirty and smelly.Then someone came along with the of the toilet, or how I view nuclear. The risk sounds higher.

Previously you were doing your smelly business on the edge of the village, now you are saying to bring it into the house? That could go wrong. You could end up with shit everywhere, but for 99.9999% of people that doesn't happen because toilets are well made and people operate them properly. If you try and put rubbish into the toilet you will have problems but otherwise you will be fine.Now I'm not saying the toilet is completely clean, I wouldn't put my hands in the toilet bowl, and I wouldn't go for a swim in a spent fuel pool, but neither is likely to do you too much damage.A toilet doesn't get rid of the waste it just moves it somewhere else, safely. It doesn't make it safe, but it does allow that to happen at a sewage plant. If it just dumped it straight into my local river that could be a problem, but it doesn't, it manages it. Nuclear plants also still have hazardous waste, but again at least it can be stored and managed safely.Toilets arent the cleanest thing in the world, I wouldn't really want one in the middle of my kitchen, but as long as they and their outputs are managed properly then I'd far prefer to have it than the alternatives.",67 followers,Chris Graham,6.3K,2K,4M,https://www.quora.com/If-all-rich-countries-of-the-world-get-together-and-allocate-10T-USD-for-fusion-research-could-we-have-a-workable-fusion-reactor-10-years-from-now
6,"I don’t think it is. It can also be used to produce nuclear weapons. Thorium is a better option. But I think, thankfully, it could be a somewhat academic question. Solar and wind are becoming so cheap that they can now compete with coal. And the old argument about they aren’t always available is mitigated somewhat by the advancement of cheap Lithium batteries, thanks to Tesla etc.But the elephant in the room, the knockout blow for nuclear, is nuclear fusion reactors.

These have been promised forJeff Brown email I received:Economical clean energy is less than five years away…As regular readers know, I have been tracking the rise of nuclear fusion technology very closely. And one of my favorite companies in the space, Commonwealth Fusion Systems (CFS), just made a big-time announcement.CFS is building a 47-acre research and manufacturing facility just west of Boston. The facility will operate at the location of the old Army post Fort Devens, which is now an economic development zone. That means CFS is getting some tax incentives to build there. It’s a smart move.As a reminder, nuclear fusion is essentially the power of the Sun. It involves taking two separate nuclei and combining them to form a new nucleus. This produces an enormous amount of energy. And it is 100% clean.Unlike nuclearCFS is pursuing the classic tokamak design for its nuclear fusion reactors. We talked about this designThe key to CFS’s approach to its reactor has been through the development of new superconductors that enable advanced magnet technology. This is necessary to control the super-hot plasma in the reactor, causing hydrogen atoms to fuse and release energy.Commonwealth Fusion Systems’ Tokamak ReactorSource: Commonwealth Fusion SystemsCFS believes that this technology will enable compact fusion reactors small enough to fit inside a small room. Yet these reactors will produce enough energy to power 100,000 homes each.We’re talking about a decentralized, clean- energy power grid with zero carbon emissions. That’s the vision.So this is one of the most exciting projects in the nuclear fusion space.And it is very well funded. CFS has raised over $250 million to date, and it will have no problem getting additional funding in the private markets right now. Clean energy is such a hot space right now, and CFS has a clear road map to develop a nuclear fusion reactor.And get this – the new facility is being built right now. CFS expects to have a full-scale demonstration of its new magnet technology by summer. We are just months away.And the company is in a full sprint right now to go from demo to final product. To that end, CFS is doubling the size of its team from 150 to 300 employees. That will put the company on track to potentially have a fully functional nuclear fusion reactor by 2025.That means that the first demonstrations of utility-scale, economical clean energy are less than five years away. I can’t overstate how important this is.And this is why the venture capital and private equity communities are so excited. They won’t have to wait 20 years for a return. We are finally within a relatively short window from an investment perspective.Nuclear fusion is how we get away from burning fossil fuels without sacrificing our ability to provide for the power needs of everybody on the planet.Rather than poking around at the edges and making small contributions to baseload energy generation, nuclear fusion can literally provide for 100% of the world’s need for electricity","4,746 followers",Fergus Mason,6.5K,6.6K,27.8M,https://www.quora.com/Is-nuclear-really-safe-and-clean-I-am-genuinely-curious

Let’s take a closer look.See those cylinder looking things the size of cars? Let’s take a closer look.These areLet’s look inside.These are designed to withstand explosions, earthquakes, drops from great heights, floods, you name it. They are incredibly heavy and incredibly strong.These casks can be loaded with fuel five years after it has cooled off enough sitting in a pool. A water pool. This one.By cool off, I mean they come out of the reactor literally thermally hot they are so radioactive. But after five years, they are cool enough to put in these gigantic trashcans.Where do the dry casks go now? It was supposed to be Yucca Mountain. It will be some sort of geological storage, stored in such a way the geologists’ and engineers’ models say it will be safe for thousands of years (still cooling all that time).This is all a challenge. However it is a challenge the nuclear industry has fully paid for, internalizing all the costs of this management, and fully accounting for every becquerel (roughly a bite of a banana) of radiation. This is in part because radioactivity is extremely easy to measure andQuantitativelyHowever, currently it is extremely expensive to build nuclear plants (when historically, it was very easy), in part thanks to regulatory inefficiencies and financial risks associated with an ever-increasing list of regulatory requirements.Nuclear faces harsh challenges, but managing waste has largely been solved.If you are curious about nuclear energy, or even concerned, I suggest you contact your nearest nuclear power station and take a tour. These are some of the most incredible engineering marvels humanity has constructed, and twenty years from now they might be regulated to oblivion. This particular power plant was beautiful to visit. A dozen miles of prime California coastline off-limits to development, teeming with wildlife and natural beauty, and a relatively tiny power plant producing prodigious amounts of clean power, literally saving the world.",32 followers,Don Bishop,1.7K,1.1K,1.3M,https://www.quora.com/Is-nuclear-really-safe-and-clean-I-am-genuinely-curious

9,"There was a very low power training reactors (I think GE made it) that I used in 1970 at Argonne national Laboratory.  As I recall the power was less than 1 watt (a weak flashlight) and the core was about 6"" diameter.  It was in a tank of water 6-8 feet diameter.This reactor was designated AGN-201, it had a 25 cm right cylindrical core, used 20% enriched uranium, and had a design power of 0.1 watts.","220,153 followers",Franklin Veaux,800,47.3K,779.4M,https://www.quora.com/If-all-rich-countries-of-the-world-get-together-and-allocate-10T-USD-for-fusion-research-could-we-have-a-workable-fusion-reactor-10-years-from-now
