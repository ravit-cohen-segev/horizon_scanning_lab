For example, it is entirely possible to create a pizza restaurant chain and be successful with it. But it is competing in a red ocean - Dominoes, Pizza hut, Papa Johns Etc…The opportunities are limited in this market.Blue oceans on the other hand are a new sector or industry that are unoccupied with competition. They are usually created from advances in technology or inventions. In blue oceans, demand is created rather than fought over.The biggest blue ocean market that has probably ever been created is the internet (split into different sectors). Think of how many companies exist and compete exclusively through it. An example of a new blue ocean that springs to mind is self-driving vehicles. You could say that Tesla and Elon Musk were responsible for creating this. There are currently no true competitors in this ocean, because the technology isn't there yet.The general idea is that billion...",103 followers,Matt Village,855,0,0,https://www.quora.com/What-industry-or-idea-will-produce-the-next-generation-of-billionaires

Those two scientists had just createdGraphene is a nearly two-dimension structure made of carbon atoms that is incredibly strong. It has unbelievable tensile strength, some 200 times stronger than steel.Additionally, it can transmit heat into electricity, and withstand incredible pressure, while being incredibly lightweight. The lightest material on Earth is made of graphene, and it can rest on the petal of a flower.So why isn’t this a trillion dollar industry? The material is so useful that it should be everywhere by now.Well, producing graphene is hard. Peeling atoms off graphite is something that’s hard to industrialize. The stuff still costs hundreds of dollars for a gram.However… that’s expected to change soon. A breakthrough this week just made the future of indestructible smartphones closer. Such a breakthrough would also bring a lot of prosperity to the people who manufacture graphene in China and especially India.That industry alone, if successful in mass-producing graphene, is expected to reach a trillion dollars, becoming worth more than the entirety of Google.And now, engineers are taking it even further, scaling different types of materials down to a single atom.

The biggest impediment to intermittent renewable energy competing head to head with fossil fuels on both price (which it already is in many geographies) and dispatchability is cost effective energy storage. There are a number of developments that will push energy storage into the realm of the affordable which will truly unlock the potential of renewables: clean, dispatchable power, at a price competitive with conventional sources of generation. This is but one piece to the puzzle (intermittent renewables) and is just the tip of the iceberg as far as potential for innovation within this vast industry.In 10 years or less, we're looking at renewable energy being a",356 followers,Gordon Miller,2.2K,10K,165.2M,https://www.quora.com/What-industry-or-idea-will-produce-the-next-generation-of-billionaires

Just as today there are people who have been able to take advantage of PGP, the overwhelming majority of people are plagued by spam.The spam of the future will be much more insidious, and seductive.I see the great opportunity for cryptocurrencies to be able to monetize attention in new ways. It’s rather the keystone of a post-modern economic order. Those of us who grew up with Walter Cronkite and three network TV stations have seen, dare I say, the devolution of authority inherent in there now being >2000 channels of television. Social media has expanded that to the very ends of cognition.However all of these have been limited by the fairly narrow regimes of capitalization. Imagine, therefore a world in which social capital becomes actually fungible. I like to give the example of the rise of video games. I started out with pinball in the 70s, listening to the Eagles. Then through the age of Pac Man, then Mortal Combat in arcades. Next Counterstrike and now World of Warcraft, Call of Duty, et al in the living room. My kids grew up watching me play.

But average Joe doesn't care about the background, and adopts the easiest solution that works.Money is simply a belief system that only works because enough people believe in it. People look past religion, culture and language barriers for cash. A universal language and belief system so to speak.Before I draw off to a tangent, cryptocurrency is heavily based on people with lots of money believing in it. A majority of cryptocurrencies are held by individuals or entities with large funds. So what do those people generally do? They invest in enterprise with great potential. The current landscape overall is overhyped and oversold, but there are some decent cryptocurrencies not in the mainstream news that offer a decent enterprise solution.Also, another thing is a lot of people who actually do understand cryptocurrency and are skeptical about its potential may see short-sightedly. What we are used to right now is not necessarily indicative of the future. If the next generation skips the whole system we have now, we can have a totally have a new system set up and blockchain technology offers that sort of potential.That being said, speculation on individual cryptocurrencies can be highly risky in the short term.
