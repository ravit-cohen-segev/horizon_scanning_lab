And when fanboys and the director try to to get the flimsy film to carry more weight than it can, that's when everything falls splat. Maybe, modern audiences get the films they deserve.Jesus Christ was an alien. Yes, that's really where really where Ridley Scott and his lost writers (Lost writer Damon Lindelof) went early on. Space engineers sent down to kill us because we crucified one of their own (as published in his interviews). See, now you're laughing just like I did in places in the finished version. Thus, onward with the show, to go where no man has ploddingly gone before.2. The Heart of Darkness.Archaeologists digging in cave find ancient civilizations' chicken scratchings showing big alien from sky. From Babylonian to Sumerian to Egyptian to Mesopotamian to etc., we are informed by the scientists that civilizations with absolutely no connection to each other show the same drawings of systems of these 5 or 6 circles. Well, those civilizations were connected to each other. (Don't be picky, I hear you clamour.) As for the circles, they are referred to as galactic systems and when the scientists pointed their telescope at it, they found this one star. And it had this one planet. And that's where they are going. I'm sorry but I'm a bit lost if those chicken doodles were in galactic systems. Galaxies contain hundreds of thousand of stars. They pointed their telescope at it and found one star? You could correct me and say they meant the 5 or 6 circles were stars. Okay, but then how do you point to the heavens and find, oh never mind. Now I'm not asking these questions because i vehemently want to but because this is really the side effect of a really lazy script. This is how a bad script looks and sounds like.None of the characters' motives or movements match anything you would expect from any human (no matter which part of the globe you're from), when making first contact with an alien life form. And what an alien life form it is. The human crew lands and stumbles through big head structure, crawling maggots, decapitated body and murals etc. If this sounds like I'm describing some romp through an abandoned Egyptian museum, that's exactly the feeling I had - Haunting wonder, yet galling logic. They, for example, start by investigating the alien's DNA. Alien with DNA. If you say, 'Aw c'mon, that's too complex for the modern audience to grasp and perfectly within margins of error', hey, I agree too. Which is why i will throw in this bit: They take the head back and decide to like make it come alive by jump starting its' nervous system, by well, jabbing the head in it's locus coeruleus (yes, I know). Head with nervous system. Hands up, all of you who spotted that. How many heads do you know have nervous systems?Maybe its' alien. Unfortunately It's the one thing i could never treat the creatures as, unlike with the earlier films - films that Ridley Scott and the marketers studiously avoid connecting to, in the publicity run-up even though its' pretty obvious. (It's ironic because it was done to build audience anticipation for a film while deliberately denying overt connection to the original and yet relying on the fans of the original as core target suckers.) In fact I'm actually surprised that they act surprised upon taking the humanoid alien's DNA later, putting it next to ours and finding that they match -totally.There is an enigmatic scene in the beautiful beginning which we have to take to mean an alien seeded life on earth with his DNA. That explains why most of us look like big white guys or Caucasoids, because that is how the aliens look. Oh, wait, hold up, what about all the rest of the human population who look like Inuitss and Bushmen and Aborigines? No wait, we weren't even the only human species for most of our genetic line on Earth. And what about all the cephalopods and nematodes, lumbering dinosaurs and pretty fireflies? Did the alien DNA forget about all these too?3. “Did IQs just drop sharply while I was away?"" - Ripley (1986)Enough with the science already, it already has the word science in science fiction, some of you might think. Alrighty. Alas, Prometheus is a not very intelligent film about higher intelligence. It comes closer to Brian De Palma's Mission to Mars (remember the silly, crying, embarrassing Disney alien at the end?) than it does to its' inspiration, Space Odyssey 2001. The script is so sophisticated and advanced that people dream in the 3rd person in it.Characters have little to no character and even worse, really embarrassing dialogue - so bad that one side-character walks in and accidentally explains away the entire film's mystery in a minute of few sentences, with not a connection to anything else that came before. This quackery starts with virtually the first lines of dialogue early in the film as a warning to us. The aforementioned archaeologists tell their dumbfounded space-crew about the chicken scribblings and tell them it's not a map, it's an invitation. They pause a second for us to go 'aahhhh.' An invitation to what? To come meet them, the Engineers. The crew asks the same question you and I would: 'Wha.what engineers, what did they engineer?' We get a super-scientific singular answer: Us. Again, the crew scratching its' head just like us, asks how they'd figure all this from chicken scratchings and if they have anything to back that up. The answer might make your popcorn pop and wish you too had left your head behind like that sad alien headcase I mentioned.Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) the scientist/archaeologist answers by saying 'I dunno, it's like what I choose to believe, like duh.' A trillion dollar journey into space in a million dollar movie and my popcorn laughed at me as the audience started giggling. All the main characters seem transfixed, or they want us to be, by the big profoundness of immortality and creation and life and evolution and especially the soul and all that and yet strangely, for all it's centrality and drive, none of them really acts or talks about it. In fact many of them act downright 5-year old, even if they are carrying alien babies full-term or just aborted a squid baby from themselves. When the odd character points us something silly to say 'How do you know, will this work?', they get the answer from Shaw 'I know that, but you must do it.' People talk or die with no real reason, just like real life too. The team walks around like it has never heard of big words like quarantine and plague. And this, after they find aliens whom they could never have met before and automatically start to ask about those strange spores on the alien head, deducing everyone had died. (They do this not with a microscope but by pointing at stuff and saying 'By jolly, them frozen cells were undergoing change, weren't they?'). They found some bodies in a far out ship and this is how they deduced the entire race of these people peoplers had died from some plague.No archaeologist in his or her right mind will run off with a head (suddenly, without explanation and hastily) because they normally work in-situ. Come to think of it, they seldom land a few hours before sunset, then step all over the scene like they're playing twister. The one guy who gets lost just happens to be the guy whose job was mapping the area so people won't get lost. The one guy who freaks out over the alien life was the biologist who was sent there to study the alien life. If you're wondering, they had a crew of 17 to pick from. I'll give you a gold star if you can recall more than a handful, never mind guess where they all went during the course of the film. Several people face-palmed themselves when the crew took off their helmets at the beginning but then again the archaeologists also tell everyone not to bring weapons to the alien site. They just know these things.People were actually screaming 'just run sideways, you idiot' when Vickers ran headlong into something falling on her, that anyone could see, including herself, from another zip-code in the sky. Many people in the audience actually threw in the towel and walked about at different sad plot points without bothering to boo like the others. And they wrote about it. And many of the loyal Alienites are not like Trekkies and the Star Wars bunch. They did not walk into theatres dressed as fanboy xenomorphs, sliming people with their goo. Somebody even wrote about the extra-ordinary transformative powers of the black goo in the film, to detect sin and perform many biological miracles. Did none of them see or hear of the X-files? That black goo is from Chris Carter. Did something happen in the editing room in post production, involving a giant facehugger sucking out brains randomly?How much skill and enterprise does it take to direct your crew to just look surprised when you meet aliens in the depths of space, who happen to look like blow-up muppet versions of you? How much talent does it take to add a few lines in a gazillion-budget behemoth of multiple re-writes to make the scenes seem logical? When you and I meet strange scary giant aliens, would you and I be really sitting around looking profound and constipated, talking about bullshit, religion and immortality? Case in point: While rifling through the alien remains the scientific expedition/ archaeological dig space-scientists/ science stuff crew landing party people/ I don't-know-what-they-are start seeing the H.R.Giger murals move mysteriously. Tension mounts. The terror builds up and the crew freak out, grab what they can, flee like bats out of hell and get into their dune buggies to rush to the safety of their parked mothership. In sequences like this, it's normally good for the suspense, for some characters with a few screws loose to be left behind.The film delivers 2 such nutty characters who ran off earlier inexplicably. One of them had the rare smart line about Darwinian evolution, so I was chuckling at the irony of him getting screwed over first. So the 2 bunk in for the night ahead of a building storm. The funny thing is all the crew were connected via live-feed to the captain of the parked Prometheus. In fact the captain was able to call up the duo on radio when he found them missing from the returning party. And he was listening when the crew freaked out and ran out earlier. Now why would you film sequences of showing the place to hold a mounting evil presence with the further acknowledgment of a devastating plague and not show any of the crew looking surprised that 2 of their number were stuck in the place they just ran from minutes ago? Did somebody forget to convey the bad mojo? To a captain who is written as a responsible character who looks out for his ship and crew?4. LV-223 not LV-426 or maybe LV-UR-HEAD@theDoor.I know. I should not be finicky. There's an old guy on board in really strange bad makeup (See if you can spot Guy Pearce under it) who funds the expedition so that he can make first contact with this strange alien civilization, to ask them about a miracle cure for his bad old-age make-up and impending death (just like in the world's oldest story - the Epic of Gilgamesh). The old man knows he can do this because he intends to get his android David to ask these aliens. Remember there are no Rosetta Stones anywhere in the film, not that I know of. Well yes, we have those aforementioned 6 crude crayon circles. But the android (David/ Michael Fassbender) does walk up to the alien god-genegineer and start speaking in a strange Khoi-San Bushmen tongue because the android is good with languages. Of course he immediately gets decapitated and has his head handed to him in John the Baptist fashion in a nod to a fondly remembered trope of the Alien franchise. Maybe he asked for some cheese by accident, after the universal translator screwed up. Or maybe, the alien just got pissed of Shaw screaming senselessly like a headless chicken in the background, before giving head.The more i paid attention to the interviews that Ridley Scott, the writer and the publicity people gave in the run-up to the film, the more it became obvious that these were daft yet deft old farts who were out to fuck you for a buck, one fuck at a time. Studio executives totally aware of the increasingly short attention span and staggering apathy of the modern movie-going audience knows it can pass off anything to you and you will not be able to tell the difference.The film is deeply evocative and mesmerizing because it puts us in a place where the film isn't. It gives us our desolation-in-space fix. We like Ripleyverse and Ridelyverse, just not the illogical places in Prometheus.There is nothing to be proud of, or feel smart alecky about, if your answer to someone asking you about the story is, ""Oh you just don't get it, it'll be in the sequel, see.."" It's about the story, stupid. If you don't get it done right once, why would you be getting it done wrong twice? You mean, we no longer go to the movies for a good story but instead wait for the sequel, while we enjoy the light show? Which idiot explains the story to you by asking you to click the sequel? This film does.5. Yes, we have replicants.Many have noted, for all the fact that we love Charlize Theron, that her character Meredith Vickers to be superfluous and stilted. I suspect her wooden performance was deliberately instructed by Ridley Scott. There is definitely something odd about her character and i will elaborate shortly, although confirmation of our suspicions have been abruptly cut short by the film's now-familiar abrupt stupidity in character building. Vickers forgets to run sideways and gets killed senselessly, out of the blue, apparently.Vickers wakes up first. Her special room is self-supporting and has a medical bay that only operates, you will notice, on males. She refers to the funder of the expedition Weyland as her father, as much as Weyland refers to David, the Fassbender android as the son he never had. There seems to be a game of one-up-man ship between Vickers and David and at one point she physically manhandles the superhuman David, up against a wall.It is very likely Vickers is an android, Now before you jump surprised, this is very familiar territory for Ridley as he has tread this female replicant path before with Blade Runner. You might say, but it is implied she slept with the ships' captain (in another of the films' illogically timed sequences). But if you look carefully, she chooses to sleep with the captain after the captain taunts her by asking her if is she is a robot. She then tells him to come to her room with a moment's hesitation and smile - as if she wants to blend in with the humans, by mimicking all their motions. The scene is illogical, because you might remember even if Ridley clearly has forgotten, that the whole purpose of this trillion-dollar, time-consuming venture into space was to find alien life. When the computer does indicate signs of alien life, the captain dismisses it as a glitch and leaves for Charlize's room.To his credit, I would too. Except for the fact that 2 of my crewmen (the team biologist and geologist) are also stranded near the source of the 'glitch', at a possibly contaminated site. I would at least look worried.6.

The story frequently has supposedly highly intelligent people doing really stupid things without any good reason. It's completely unrealistic with injuries and it often has things happen with no good reason simply to move to the next plot point.Many of the plot problems seem to have occurred when writers changed scenes to tie Prometheus back to the original Alien movie. For example in Alien a tech tries to coax his cat out of the vents. Then the Alien kills him.  In Prometheus a scientist coax's an Alien thing to come to him by talking to it like a cat. Then it kills him.The big problem with this movie is that it has no unifying creative vision. The screenplay appears to have passed from writer to writer who each made local changes to fix plot problems without any consideration of the effect on the characters and story overall.Overall Prometheus is a badly written movie and Ridley Scott is to blame.,0 followers,Rick R,10.3K,796,4.4M,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-plot-holes-in-Prometheus

9,"I'm sure there are many, many things that constitute ""plot holes"" within Prometheus, in the context of the Alien/Predator universe, but the most unforgivable thing about the film is its flagrant disregard for our current understanding of science, biology and genetics in particular.Here are the most ridiculous and (practically) irredeemable inaccuracies:1.

DisreI'm sure there are many, many things that constitute ""plot holes"" within Prometheus, in the context of the Alien/Predator universe, but the most unforgivable thing about the film is its flagrant disregard for our current understanding of science, biology and genetics in particular.Here are the most ridiculous and (practically) irredeemable inaccuracies:1. The ""seeding"" of Earth by extraterrestrials.The opening scene, where we are allegedly witnessing the ritualistic ""seeding"" of Earth by a sapient alien organism, would have happened billions of years ago, when life originated on Earth.  Disregarding the fact that life actually originated in the ocean, and probably the deep ocean at that, but certainly not in a freshwater river, the scene implies that the alien race has remained morphologically unchanged during a time frame in which life on Earth evolved from anaerobic bacteria into all of the species living today, including humans.  Moreover, the whole scenario massively begs a lot of questions: How did the original aliens come to be? Why does exactly one of the nearly innumerable lineages on Earth (hominids) evolve to resemble them?  What were they hoping to learn, by allowing us to evolve for billions of years, that couldn't have been accomplished in a computer simulation?Note: the ""theory"" that humans were the only ""engineered"" organisms and so the ""seeding"" event happened more recently is also unacceptably ignorant, given our modern understanding of biology.  Humans are unmistakably related to other apes, just like apes are unmistakably related to all other mammals, mammals to other vertebrates, vertebrates to other animals, animals to other eukaryotes (plants and fungi) and so on.  Therefore, the seeding of Earth could only have produced the last universal ancestor of life on this planet, from which ALL other lineages emerged.Redeemable if: The opening scene happened on a different planet, for a different reason, and is totally unrelated to the hair-brained genesis theory put forth by the two main pseudo-scientists in the film.2. The aliens have almost exactly the same DNA-based genome as humans.This is so implausible that it barely even merits a response.  I've mentioned before on this site that extraterrestrial life could (and in all likelihoodNow, in my head, I can already hear some of the readers here asking ""but Joseph, since the aliens look so much like us, wouldn't it make sense that their DNA would be really similar to ours?""  The answer is no, and here's why:This may surprise some people (it certainly amazed me when I heard it), but about 98% of our DNA is non-coding, meaning that the part of our genome that actually contains genes is remarkably small.  Non-coding DNA is never actually translated, and it is quite possible that a great deal of our genome is composed of ""junk"" DNA, genetic material that neither codes for proteins nor ribozymes and plays no regulatory role.  Importantly, junk DNA sequences can be rewritten or even removed altogether with no real consequences to future offspring, and this has actually been tested and confirmed in a laboratory setting.Mice do fine without 'junk DNA'Regarding the 2% of our DNA thatWhat does all of this mean? Well, ultimately,So why do these aliens, separated by billions of years and a complete DNA disintegration event, have ""human"" DNA?Redeemable if: (See redemption #1 PLUS) The aliens are actually humans that somehow became super intelligent and left Earth tens to hundreds of thousands of ago.3.  Somehow, in the future, people still don't understand or accept biological evolution.Seriously, what the hell was up with that?!  Even the ""biologist"" accuses the main characters of ignoring ""Darwinism.""  It's 2014 and we already stopped calling natural selection ""Darwinism"" like a century ago; the term has basically been reduced to a pejorative used by anti-intellectuals at this point.  Plus, the modern synthesis of evolutionary theory places a lot more emphasis on neutral molecular evolution, genetic diversity, and developmental constraints than ""survival of the fittest.""  Actually, evolution is such a broad, central, and demonstrably real concept in science and medicine that, if any societies still carry the creationist bug 80 years from now, they probably won't be the ones with the technology to travel to other planets.Redeemable if: The entire mission was actually a last-ditch effort by the Discovery Institute to lend credibility to their Intelligent Design claims and the hyper-advanced humans (see redemption#2) decide to destroy Earth to spare the galaxy from a potential race of space-travelling apologists.",71 followers,Damon Troope,1.6K,100,622K,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-plot-holes-in-Prometheus

It is almost as if Weyland decided to trust his mission, his money and his life to a bunch of insane people.If the characters had been intelligent this movie could have been amazing but as they were written they seemed completely unbelievable and they broke the suspension of disbelief for me. Maybe their faster than light drive system malfunctioned mid flight and gave them all FTL insanity syndrome, I really don't know..Let's run down the list of the cartoonish parodies that were the characters in this film and I think you might see my issues.Janek the captain of thePart 2 other issues...A summary... by HISHE",49 followers,David Brown,1.7K,3.3K,8.6M,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-plot-holes-in-Prometheus

I mean, I can't even talk about it. Everything everybody said plus the fact that Scott is an abuser. I wait 25 years for another good Alien movie and instead of getting getting a plausible story, we get shit writing that a high school student English student would reject for being poorly conceived.
