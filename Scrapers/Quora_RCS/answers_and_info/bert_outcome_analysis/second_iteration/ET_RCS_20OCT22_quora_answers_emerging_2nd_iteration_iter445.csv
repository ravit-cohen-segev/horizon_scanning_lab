Apparently it’s very difficult to cool down electronics in space, due to vacuum being an excellent insulator.Besides, why bother with the nuclear power, when solar works so well up there… and how would you even get reactors and stuff in orbit, when the rockets that have to carry them can potentially blow up and shower everybody with radioactive waste…","105,625 followers",Dave Consiglio,4.4K,6.8K,91.4M,https://www.quora.com/Would-it-be-beneficial-to-build-massive-nuclear-powered-super-computers-in-space

8,"This was asked elsewhere.It would be kind of stupid for a number of reasons. Fixing problems would be among those because state of the art technology tends to be flakey.

Nope.I’m giving the generalized answer to the answer I gave before because compute in orbit (say over a planet like Venus) might have some advantages, but over the Earth, no.

Moreover, the time spent on the ISS by astronauts from each country is allocated according to the amount of money or resources invested by their country. As of January 2018, a total of 230 astronauts from 18 countries have visited the ISS, with astronauts from the United States and Russia making up the majority, 145 and 46 respectively.This is not the case with the Chinese space station, where China is willing to offer all countries the opportunity to use the Chinese space station, sending a very positive signal in terms of promoting space exploration and cooperation that will give many countries that do not have access to space the opportunity to do so.A total of 27 countries have applied to be on the Chinese Tiangong space station, and China has agreed to cooperate with 16 countries, including Switzerland, Poland, Germany, Italy, Norway, France, Spain, the Netherlands, India, Russia, Belgium, Kenya, Japan, Saudi Arabia, Mexico and Peru. Among them, the European Space Agency has already sent astronauts to China to train with Chinese astronauts. Matthias Maurer, an astronaut from the European Space Agency who participated in the training, had even before this started to actively learn Chinese in preparation for entering the Chinese Tiangong space station, and it is safe to say that in the near future we could see images of Chinese and foreign astronauts jointly participating in flights.",UNKNOWN,Robert Frost,900,9.4K,195.4M,https://www.quora.com/Would-it-be-beneficial-to-build-massive-nuclear-powered-super-computers-in-space

11,"Yes!Oh, I guess I should put more than that. Even from the earliest days of space flight computers have had a role, initially these would be analogue machines, one notable example would be Yuri Gagarin, they weren’t sure of the effects of being in space upon the human body, they speculated he might loose his mind or otherwise be rendered unable to operate his craft, so it was completely automated.

He needed to input a code to take manual control (in case of emergency) but that was deliberately made to be a task in itself.Things progressed of course but early digital computers where bulky things, so typically most of the calculation for the orbits where done on the ground long before the launch, that is not to say the space craft of this era where completely without computers however. Often they used something cool called Core Rope Memory, your computer literally had its program hand woven into it, since this was much less bulky than read-write magnetic memory available at the time, though they incorporated a small amount of that as well.The lunar lander was intended to land very much on autopilot, however its computer became overloaded with the feedback from its rendezvous radar (left in standby in case they needed to abort) and nearly put them into a boulder leaving Neil Armstrong to take manual control and put it down safely.As for today, with computers so small, cheap and generally ubiquitous, practically everything is done by computer. About the only instance of manual control during a mission critical area that I can think of was during the testing of the space shuttle on mission STS-2 where deorbit and reentry where manually performed despite some fuel cell problems that otherwise cut the mission short. Normally the pilot of the shuttle only takes control, for the first and last time, some 5 minutes before landing during final approach.","20,805 followers",Alan Mellor,3.9K,12.2K,63.5M,https://www.quora.com/Would-it-be-beneficial-to-build-massive-nuclear-powered-super-computers-in-space

13,"If you are serious about anyone being able to detect our satellites from other galaxies then the chance is nil.

The radiation from Sputnik and satellites launched since then will have travelled in a sphere with a maximum radius of approximately 64 light years. So any civilisation within that bubble sayv couple hundred stars,with the right detectors could in theory detect us.However thanks to the inverse square law ,whereby the energy of radiation diminishes by the square of its distance, they would need detectors about the size of their solar systems to detect us . And then some pretty awesome computer power to filter out the radiation from our own sun and other sources like planets.All this to tune into I love Lucy?

16,"By spotting Earth, I assume that you mean “detect” Earth, as in detect our radio signals. We have been sending satellites into orbit for about 3/4 of a century, and we have been broadcasting radio waves into the atmosphere since November 1920, almost 101 years ago.. It is assumed that broadcast signals into our atmosphere carry into space as well, albeit at a much weaker strength than received here on Earth. Based upon those facts and assumptions, any alien civilization capable of receiving and interpreting our signals, within 101 light years of Earth may be able to detect our signals.

Since our closest neighboring galaxy is 2.5 million light years away, anyone listening would have to be in the Milky Way galaxy, where our closest neighboring star is Proxima Centauri at 4.25 light years away, with a couple of planets in the “Goldilocks zone” that bear a low-but-non-zero chance of hosting life.","10,085 followers",Nancy Malar,4K,678,11.6M,https://www.quora.com/Would-it-be-beneficial-to-build-massive-nuclear-powered-super-computers-in-space
