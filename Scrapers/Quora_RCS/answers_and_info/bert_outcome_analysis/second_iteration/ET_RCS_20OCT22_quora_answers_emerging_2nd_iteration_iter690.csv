1,"We can’t send a person to the moon now for one reason: $$$money$$$.Apollo was fantastically, unbelievably expensive. And what it returned for that money, aside from technical and scientific knowledge, was…national prestige.We can return to the moon if we want. All it will take is for Congress to allocate the money. Congress has determined in its wisdom that it would rather borrow $1 trillion to give an enormous handout to billionaires and huge megacorps than go to the moon, so we can’t go to the moon.It’s not technical. It’s never been technical. It’s all about the money.","220,165 followers",Franklin Veaux,4K,47.3K,779.6M,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-process-of-attaining-a-professorship
2,"Want to know why we can’t send humans to the Moon today? I can answer that question with one word and one number:NASA had plans for three more lunar landings after Apollo 17. Most of the equipment for them was built. Two of the Saturn V rockets that would have taken them to the Moon were built. The crews had been tentatively selected. Apollo 18 even had a mission patch!But those missions never happened. In January, 1970, NASA cancelled Apollo 20. In September, 1970, Congress cut off funding for Apollo 18 and 19 as well. The decision boiled down to three main reasons:Want to know why we can’t send humans to the Moon today?

The decision boiled down to three main reasons:The immediate savings from canceling Apollo 18 and 19 were negligible, just $42 million, since all of the equipment and personnel were already in place for those missions. So the real rationale can be found in reasons #2 and #3. Basically, public support for the Moon landings had always been mixed (except for the burst of excitement around the historic Apollo 11 touchdown), and politicians saw little upside to keeping the program going.Now back to your question. The U.S. couldn’t even go back to the moon in 1973,The same is true today. If the public was clamoring to go back to the Moon, and if the president and Congress were willing to spend the $100 billion or so needed to do it properly, and if there were a goal-oriented plan in place to make it happen, it would happen. Quickly. We would easily make Trump’s 2024 target. Technology is not an obstacle—certainly not computer technology.Instead, NASA has been given trickles of money for human spaceflight. Most of that now supports the International Space Station (a worthy project, in my opinion) and the SLS rocket (a boondoggle designed mostly to create jobs and keep up appearances, in my opinion). The political leaders in the US give NASA a new direction every 4 years, sometimes every 2 years, sometimes changing their minds daily. There is no way to establish a viable human spaceflight program without a consistent set of goals.The real reason we haven’t gone back to the Moon has nothing to do with RAM or computing power, and everything to do with human nature.",UNKNOWN,Corey S.

This, unfortunately, greatly inflates the costs of designing anything compared to the old organization.The point is that there has not been a national will to spend that kind of money again on space exploration. There is a little bit more will to go after the Mars mission but realistically even that is mostly talk.EDIT: It is worth noting that SpaceX has been making great strides in developing low cost rocket technology.

And this was just a few years away. And USA had absolutely nothing.Then USA, paranoid as always, never thinking anything is urgent until it knocks on the door, really put everything into high gear. They took probably 10% of the national economy and put it towards putting a man on the moon. And the results of basically no budget, a blank check, did not fail. Within a year USA was right there up with the Russians. Space satellites, men floating around earth. You name it.Then JFK decided he wanted a man to walk on the moon before 1st Jan 1970, as in sometime in the 1960s.Hundreds of thousands of people were involved, even Canadians. The immigrants from Europe paid off, many of the Jews that were allowed in were mathematicians, physicists, scientists and they han Werner von Brain. This was a team no money could have paid for, just a homicidal maniac in a European country could accomplish.And with this the Apollo space mission came to be. A man on the moon.Through hard negotiations it was agreed by the countries of earth that no country would own the moon, it was for earth.After 6 successful missions to the moon, 12 men walked there and did experiments, only 1 failed mission, Apollo 13.Then people of USA got tired of paying really high taxes and people had lost interest in space travel. USA stopped their missions. Nasa had their budget reduced dramatically.This had also basically wiped out the money the Russians had to use on space travel. Even though they did eventually make real habitable space stations and did many other things they never landed on the moon. Not because they could not, but there was nothing left to do there.We can go to the moon. You don't need a powerful computer to do this, it isn't even important. What is important is money. This costs significantly more than just going to space. Like many hundred times more.Currently, for USA, there is no imminent threat so they really have no interest whatsoever. European space agency just does not have the money. Russians still have no interest.It is quite limited value you get by sending people to the moon. It is much cheaper to send robots, way way way cheaper. This is why we send robots to Mars, without problems. Mars is currently much more interesting than the moon. We have sent probes to some moons around Jupiter and Saturnus which have changed our view on life in space among other things.It is just money.It is just laughable when these morons claim we can't get there today, with the agenda that we never went there. These are the same idiots who claim we could not build the pyramids of Egypt today. We would have absolutely no problems doing this. We build much more complicated buildings every day.Don't confuse these two, having the money to do so and not being able to.","30,834 followers",Shaunak Bhattacharjeee,15.7K,3.3K,217.4M,https://www.quora.com/If-NASA-can-send-humans-to-moon-in-1969-why-not-now-in-2015-Also-does-this-make-way-for-more-people-to-believe-in-conspiracy-theories

These are made up numbers, don’t get hung up on them, they are just to show you the shape of things.Let’s say it takes nine tons of fuel to get one ton into Earth orbit. So, at launch, that’s a 10 ton craft.Further, it takes one more ton to return to Earth. So now you need a twenty ton at launch vehicle, so you got one ton of capsule plus one ton of fuel up there.But it’s going to take nine tons to move one ton from Earth orbit to Lunar orbit. So you need eighteen tons of fuel to get your one ton of capsule plus one ton of “landing” fuel into that orbit. But that means you need to get twenty tons total (fuel plus craft) up from the Earth’s surface, so you need 180 tons of fuel, that’s a 200 ton launch vehicle.That’s a one way trip, no return ticket, bare minimum to meet your “send a person to the moon” requirements.Nobody is going to send that suicide mission though.So, now you have your one ton capsule on the lunar surface, and you need to get it home. Well, it’s going to take two tons of fuel to get one ton back to lunar orbit. Then it’s going to take nine tons of fuel to get back to Earth orbit for every ton… but that means you need to move a ten ton craft from the lunar surface, which means you had to bring twenty tons of fuel down there. So that’s a 30 ton craft on the Moon, and it took 30 tons of fuel to land it, so that’s a 60 ton craft, and to get THAT from Earth orbit to Lunar orbit took 540 tons of fuel, a 600 ton vehicle, and that means your “launch from Earth’s surface” fuel requirements were 5400 tons, a 6000 ton launch vehicle.What’s that, you need to land that capsule on Earth still? OH, well you need a ton of fuel to get that one ton capsule down. So just double everything.12,000 tons per ton of capsule.Now, the Apollo program didn’t do it that way, it left the “return to Earth” fuel in lunar orbit and sent down just a lander with enough fuel to get the lander itself back up to Lunar orbit. So that helps, if we do it that way. They also skipped the “return to Earth Orbit” part, going in directly to landing, which shaved a significant amount of fuel mass at the end of the day, which matters a lot at the start of the mission.But we also don’t have a lander, we don’t have an ascent from the moon vehicle. Our craft are designed to land in an atmosphere, so we don’t need to go full rocket-only brakes to slow from the 4000mph or so speeds of lunar orbit to a nearly 0 mph landing (again, numbers made up)Could we do it? Yes, we could. We are much better at orbital rendevous now, we have most of the engineering figured out, we could do an assembly-in-Earth-orbit using multiple launches instead of doing everything in one go like the Saturn V. But it would take several years to do this, and that’s good because it would also take several years to train the crew.The US political system has a problem. It works in 4 year increments. So, someone gets elected president, proposes a Lunar mission, people start working on it… and someone else gets elected, cancels it, announces a Mars mission. People start working on that. The next guy gets elected, cancels, announces a Lunar mission. This has been going on for decades, and we’re no closer to either than we were when we started.Someone might do it. It probably won’t be NASA.",433 followers,Peter Kosen,1.6K,1.3K,1.8M,https://www.quora.com/If-NASA-can-send-humans-to-moon-in-1969-why-not-now-in-2015-Also-does-this-make-way-for-more-people-to-believe-in-conspiracy-theories

However, there is a very popular conspiracy theory that suggests that the ship that sank on 15th April 1912 was not the Titanic.The Titanic was owned by JP Morgan who also happened to own another ship, the Olympic. Now, the Olympic was very old and required a lot of maintenance to be done. The ship was also in some sort of an accident and the company was in need of a lot of money as well. So JP Morgan devised a cunning plan. Instead of the Titanic, the Olympic was prepared for the voyage, disguised as the Titanic. The name ‘Olympic’ was painted off at the very last moment and the name ‘RMS Titanic’ was freshly inscribed on it. There is also a burnt mark on the ship’s hull. Of course, a newly constructed ship that never went to the seas cannot have it unless it was a used ship.The theory is that JP Morgan, on purpose sank the Olympic which was actually disguised as the Titanic because he knew that would allow him to get a lot of money from the Titanic’s insurance. There was no point in sinking the newly built Titanic when he could sink an old ship that anyway required repairs and maintenance! So he scratched off the paint, swap the names and sink the Olympic. The insurance money was claimed as a result.But it gets worse. Among 2,400 passengers on the so-called Titanic were present all the business competitors of JP Morgan, each one of them! None of them survived. JP Morgan invited them to the maiden voyage of the Titanic but himself cancelled his ticket, just 20 minutes prior to the ship’s departure.There was a guy named James Fenton who worked on the ship and survived the wreck. On his deathbed, his last words were “The Titanic never sank. It was the Olympic.” And people never lie on their deathbeds.","1,321 followers",Frida Schiess,4.7K,1.4K,4.5M,https://www.quora.com/If-NASA-can-send-humans-to-moon-in-1969-why-not-now-in-2015-Also-does-this-make-way-for-more-people-to-believe-in-conspiracy-theories

So, we could build a huge tower with foundations as large as Canada, in Canada, but I doubt Canada would allow it!

Everyone knows the world’s tallest mountain, right? This ought to be a one-word answer, no?Well fret not, dear reader, for I am about to explain myself. I might as well begin with the answer that everyone knows.EverestReaching an elevation of 8848 meters above sea level, the peak of Everest is traditionally held to be the highest point on Earth. This is because our traditional measure of height is elevation above sea level, and no other mountain can match Everest in that regard. By traditional metrics, Everest stands supreme.So why do I claim that there are other contenders? The answer has to do with the bases of these mountains.As you can see in the picture above, Everest doesn’t exactly stand alone in its neighborhood. It is in fact merely the tallest pointy bit of theSo let me ask you this: who is taller, a six-and-a-half foot man on four-foot stilts or a seven-foot man in normal shoes? That metaphor brings me to my next claimant.Kilimanjaro(Image source:While the summit of Mount Kilimanjaro is nearly three-thousand meters below Everest’s in terms of total elevation, the tallest mountain in Africa is remarkable for not being part of any mountain range. Everest is merely the longest tooth of the Nepalese Himalayas, but Kilimanjaro rises directly out of the East-African plains. Measured from its base, Kilimanjaro rises about 5600 meters, while Everest’s rise from base is only about 5200. The argument is a shaky one at best, but I still feel it gives Kilimanjaro a claim to being the tallest mountain on Earth by at least one very specific measure.But if we are going to measure from the base, we can actually go much deeper than the African savanna, which brings us to our next claimant.Mauna KeaThe peak of Hawaii’s Mauna Kea stands below even the base of Everest, which might make it seem an odd choice for this list. The base of the mountain, however (as of its sister-peak Mauna Loa), lies at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean’s abyssal plain, giving it a rise that dwarfs all of the above. Measured from its deep-sea base, Mauna Kea rises over 10000 meters, nearly doubling both Everest and Kilimanjaro, though only a tiny portion of the mountain is above sea level. Nonetheless, it is another claimant.So to recap, here is a visual representation of the mountains we have looked at so far:(Image source:But I said that there were four contenders. What is the last one?Our final claimant is one you’ve likely never heard of, but its summit holds a very serious claim to being the highest point on Earth.ChimborazoThe summit of Chimborazo, in Ecuador, holds the interesting distinction of being the farthest point from the center of the Earth. If you are confused, I understand. After all, shouldn’t that be the same as the highest elevation since the Earth is a sphere?As it happens, the Earth is not actually spherical. The centrifugal force of its spin gives it a significant bulge around the equator. In other words, if you shrunk the Earth down to the size of a desktop globe and measured its circumference, you would find that if you stretched your measuring tape around the equator, it would be noticably larger than if you wrapped it from pole to pole. Chimborazo stands at only a single degree of latitude below the Equator, making its peak very slightly (about 2 km) further from the center of the Earth than Everest’s. Here is a super-duper scientific image to demonstrate the difference:(Image source:So in conclusion, while Everest is certainly the tallest mountain by the traditional measuring system, one can certainly build an argument for other peaks being even taller.Thanks for reading, and don’t be afraid to think outside the box.(All images not otherwise sourced are from Wikimedia Commons)",245 followers,Joshua Gross,3.9K,26.8K,257.5M,https://www.quora.com/If-NASA-can-send-humans-to-moon-in-1969-why-not-now-in-2015-Also-does-this-make-way-for-more-people-to-believe-in-conspiracy-theories

The factor that makes psychohistory useless.Let’s take a step back. The notion of psychohistory, by it’s very nature, rejects the “Great Man” theory of history, which is the notion that history is made by powerful and ambitious individuals bending the world to their will. Instead, it assumes that the “trends and forces” theory of history is the correct one. It assumes that most things that happen in history (if not everything) are a consequence of historical forces: social trends, economic incentives, population pressures, and so on and so forth.Psychohistory assumes that the choices made by individuals are ultimately irrelevant to history: if George Washington had stayed loyal to the British crown, someone else would have led the revolution, or the United States would have become independent in some other way, because history demanded it. If Genghis Khan had renounced violence at an early age, the Mongol Empire (and their subsequent conquests of Asia) would have happened anyway, and would have been just as short lived. If Adolf Hitler had been hit by an artillery strike in World War 1, fascism would have arisen in Germany anyway, and would have led to a new world war in any case.Within the universe of the Foundation series, this interpretation of history is assumed to be true (with some wiggle room for the Second Foundation meddling that we find out about later). But the Mule throws all of that out the window. Why? Because he has what is arguably the most powerful single ability in all of fiction: mind control.I mean, technically it’s emotional control, but it comes down to the same thing. He can alter anybody’s motivations and feelings and drives to whatever he wants them to be, fundamentally changing their actions. That notion is absolutely terrifying, because it gives a person basically unlimited control over others. He can take over entire societies, simply by making everyone in a position of influence loyal to him. And then he can conquer other societies, simply by making all of their leaders want to surrender to him as well. He’s effectively an unstoppable force.That’s something that psychohistory can never account for. The plan assumes that no one person can chance the course of history, and the Mule can. The plan assumes that the way humans react to events will remain the same (the ‘psycho-’ part of psychohistory), and the Mule can change how people react on a whim.And, by the same token, if the Mule changes his mind about what he’s doing, or becomes more aggressive, or dies, any of those things will change history, because he’s the only one with that power. Which means that a person who could kill him has the power to alter history as well.The Mule’s unique and fantastical abilities would make him potentially the most powerful person in real life as well.
