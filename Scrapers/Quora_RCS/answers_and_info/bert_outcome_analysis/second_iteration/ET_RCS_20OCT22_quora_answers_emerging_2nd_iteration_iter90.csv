Of course news outlets operate on the premise thatToken values bleed, blockchain they fail to comprehend, because they think as consumers and view a consumer item sale as a singular event, instead of seeing it in terms of a supply chain, with hundreds of vendors and thousands of sub assemblies.Any large consumer item is a thousand transactions upstream of the marketing fetish creation. Those thousand transactions can be clockchained.There is a second dimension to this.A tech company is intrinsically worth nothing. You could claim earnings has a bearing on stock price. But at the end of the day its the future potential of the technology that commands the highest prices.The fact that this week Twitter had their first profitable quarter and that its stock price went up is a testament to the failure to imagine the future potential of the company.Elon Musk flying to Mars has imaginative potential. Delivery delays because they have to source 30,000 components from 3000 suppliers and assemble the kit with JIT manufacturing principles is instead a GM play at your marginal utility rate.Token or blockchain have zero intrinsic value. That does not mean the future potential of the technology is not the same as HTML technology circa 1995.The true value has a third dimension in as much as a company might have value to a third party.Corporate culture does not allow for innovation or entrepreneurship. They are allergic to it. They can on the other hand throw massive resources at a problem and reverse engineer technology. They are not on the other hand always capable of capturing market share, or capturing the brand equity some other company has already pegged to the technology. Its risky business, and corporations shun risk in any form.If you have to duplicate a technology, duplicate a marketing strategy, do a brand extension, and capture a market, a corporate acquirer might value a company not in terms of its intrinsic value,There is a time dimension to that, in as much as if the process will take three years, they are forfeiting three years worth of revenue at their scale.Their scale might be worldwide with massive ad spend in all world markets. Their dimension might be 50X somebody selling a tech solution in Silicon Valley.Which means you need to qualify the intrinsic value at 50X because that is what that company or technology is worth to a large transnational corporation right now.Microsoft bought Skype because they needed to know who was doing business with who. They bought LinkedIn because they needed to put a name on those connections. In sales parlance they are qualifying the sales lead. If I am selling to ‚Äúcompany xyz‚Äù I need to know who I am pitching and everybody else they interact with.That is the value that a company like WhatsApp had for Facebook.There is more to valuation than intrinsic value. For a tech startup, the value is the potential at full scale.Google did not create Adsense or the concept of purchased key word rankings, they purchased the companies that pioneered those technologies.

These coins work mostly on a demand and supply equation and fundamental analysis do NOT apply to these asset classes. Most people trade on the basis of technical analysis. I am not a luminary in the field of block chain and coins to comment on what fundamentals drive their price. I will leave this part of your query open for other commentators to opine. So, if you want to learn more about crypto, try listening to some experts or experienced people.I don't claim to be an expert, but if you want, I can give you a few pointers. Well, I did a lot of digging from other questions related to this topic and noticed that recently people are interested in some of the following cryptocurrencies: USDP, Velas, Luminos... seem to have a lot of potentials. I‚Äôm really into Luminos these days. This is a project with a very good foundation. They also try hard to develop more in many other fields such as gaming (VICE) or platform called Fandoms that lets artists, singers, and other content creators market and sell their digital work and services to their audience, earning money through the site's subscription service, auction, or NFT sale.One feature of this project that I really enjoy is that it safeguards any information posted to the blockchain from censorship or removal by any central authority, allowing freedom of production and distribution through decentralized blockchain technology that is currently unavailable elsewhere.

The main premise of his article focuses on the problem of people having their valuable, hard-earned time stolen away by corrupt monetary systems. He cites examples from the 16th century to teach lessons that may be more relevant than you might think in the near future.The other sound recommendation I have is by another pioneer in the field, the Lebanese economist Dr. Saifedean Ammous. Here's a picture of the nice hardback edition below.Now this is a very popular book on the topic - you'll find this title appears near the top of many Bitcoin enthusiasts' must-read lists. What's great about it is it's not limited to just Bitcoin, it explains what sound money is and what properties it should carry. The front cover depicts the different mediums of exchange human civilization has adopted throughout its history - an emphasis on how these concepts have remained relevant even as humanity changed. Dr. Saifedean goes into great depth exploring the importance Bitcoin has in today's world and how early adopters can expect to benefit when the Bitcoin standard inevitably comes to fruition. While the book is available in 25 other languages, the Arabic version is free on his website for those of you who are proficient.

Trading in the Zone: Mastering the Market with Confidence, Discipline and a Winning AttitudeTrading in the Zone‚ÄúTrading doesn‚Äôt just reveal your character,‚Äù Douglas says, ‚Äúit also builds it if you stay in the game long enough.‚Äù His lessons helped me identify many of my own mental biases, better manage my emotions, and ultimately led to more confidence in trading highly volatile crypto markets.2. What I Learned Losing a Million DollarsJim Paul was raised in a small town in Northern Kentucky and eventually moved to become governor of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. His story is a rollercoaster ride of success and failure. At the pinnacle of his trading career he blew $1.6 million, not just $1 million‚Ä¶ in one trade.He paints a cautionary tale of hubris and getting caught up in our own thoughts, disregarding clear warning signs and what happens when we get too greedy (sound familiar?).While he was focusing on commodities, the lessons apply across any financial asset and where high-stakes decisions are being made. I read it before the crypto bubble burst (and before I lost a lot of money) so it‚Äôs taken on new meaning for me in the past year, as it might for you.3. Thinking, Fast and SlowThinking, Fast and SlowAll of this applies directly to how you trade and invest. Concepts that fascinated me: the peak end rule, regression to the mean, priming effects, anchoring, saliency‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääbeing aware of these and how they operate are the firsts steps to protect yourself against your own (potentially) self-destructive instincts.4. Ego is the Enemy: The Fight to Master our Greatest OpponentEgo is the EnemyFrom Persian King Xerxes to Steve Jobs, there are plenty of examples that illustrate the dangers of ego run amuck; in some cases the protagonists emerge victorious after realizing their wrongdoings, in other situations they dig their own grave. Each chapter provides a good antidote for those who feel like they‚Äôre on their high horse and need to be brought down to earth, and equally for those who are paralyzed to the point of inaction by their own self-criticism and fear.5. Thinking in Bets: Making Smarter Decisions When You Don‚Äôt Have all the FactsAnnie Duke graduated university with plans to become a psychologist, but after her brother invited her for a poker night, she fell in love with the game and went on to become a World Series Poker champion. She draws on examples from business, sports, politics, and of course poker to share tools anyone can use to embrace uncertainty and make better decisions. Annie makes the point that our life is not like chess‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwe don‚Äôt have all of the pieces in front of us.An important less from the book:Instead of trying to make the market fit your financial goals, the wiser choice is to create systems that allow you to make higher-probability winning trades. It could be as simple as setting a stop-loss, or always writing down your trades before executing.6. The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do in Life and BusinessIt‚Äôs pretty hard to build a good habit, like doing 100 pushups a day, eating a healthy amount of broccoli, or listening before you speak. Once temptation comes calling, it‚Äôs easy to slip back into bad habits, like stuffing my mouth with hazelnut chocolate or not shutting up when I should.The fascinating part is that the mechanism for habit building is the same, whether good or bad. I never really understood this until I read this book, and it helped de-mystify a lot about my own behavior. For anybody looking for a practical guide to break bad habits, and build new ones‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthis is it.7. The Third Industrial Revolution: How Lateral Power Is Transforming Energy, the Economy, and the WorldThe third industrial revolution goes something like this: Rather than have centralized power plants and grids (both fossil and renewable), we develop a decentralized power grid. Every house and every building would have their own solar panels/renewable energy; each building thus effectively turns into its own little power plant. Energy that isn‚Äôt used can be stored using hydrogen fuel cells and distributed/shared/sold on a decentralized grid to other people who want energy. It‚Äôs what the internet did for information, except for energy.Topics that are covered in the book which fascinated me:Decentralization is at the core of the 3rd industrial revolution and there‚Äôs no doubt that blockchain technology will be the backbone of the infrastructure required to make it happen.

It‚Äôs not the easiest read, yes, but it‚Äôs a classic, foundational work. The new and revised edition has commentary after every chapter that explains the concepts in laymen‚Äôs terms, which I found extremely valuable and much easier to digest.A lot of the principles‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääparticularly in terms of risk management‚Äî are timeless.

His anonymity is probably for the better, but the appeal of mystery is hard to forego. This is an interesting compilation of Satoshi‚Äôs emails and posts on forums over the years. It provides a convenient way to parse through what Bitcoin‚Äôs creator wrote over the span of the two years that constituted his ‚Äúpublic life‚Äù before he disappeared.
