0,"Depends on if you want to burn, suffocate, or starve. If you want to burn be within eyeshot of the impact. If you want to suffocate get outside the blast radius and wait until the particulates overwhelm your breathing. If you want to starve build an underground bunker and hermetically seal it. Eventually you'll run out of food and starve. If its a tiny little asteroid.... just don't stand directly under it.",15 followers,Mike Miller,3.7K,10.7K,51M,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-safest-position-to-be-in-if-a-big-asteroid-hits

2,"Generally speaking in a nuclear submarine. Water is excellent protection, and the submarine is largely self-sufficient. Of course this won’t help if a big asteroid hits very near the submarine, but if it only hits fairly near, the submarine has the mobility to go anywhere on Earth.Next: In a well provisioned bunker under a mountain.

If it’s burning hell outside though, you do want the bunker to be well-provisioned.Or: In a large oceangoing ship. The rain of molten rocks won’t be that “dense”, the chance of physically getting clobbered isn’t all that high, but it will set fire to everything. Being out at sea there is nothing flammable, also ships far out at sea are immune to tsunamis. Like the submarine, the ship can set a course to less badly impacted areas. And the ocean ecology will in general suffer less than the terrestrial ecology.Or: On the other side of the world from the impact. Most the burning rocks won’t make it that far.Or: In New Zealand. Since meteors and all other forms of extraterrestrial intruders love to target USA: just kidding. Statistically speaking, New Zealand as a very small land mass is unlikely to take a land hit. An asteroid impacting the ocean will create a tsunami but New Zealand is pretty mountainous and isn’t going to get completely erased by a tsunami (but don’t be in Auckland). And having lots of ocean around is generally just good, it really helps to regulate temperatures and also filter crap out the atmosphere and as noted above, doesn’t catch fire and generate vast clouds of soot. Just statistically speaking, New Zealand is safer and won’t suffer as badly from climate effects due to the ocean. I’d generally prefer to be on any mountainous island rather than deep in a continent.",UNKNOWN,Robert Frost,8.4K,9.4K,195.4M,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-safest-position-to-be-in-if-a-big-asteroid-hits
3,"What would happen if an asteroid the size of Europe was discovered to undoubtedly be on a collision course with Earth with impact expected in a year?One year isn’t time to do anything about a Europe-sized planet (which is too big to be an asteroid or dwarf planet) headed toward Earth. (If you’re about to comment about nukes, please see the addendum.) I’d suggest a lot of hedonism before everyone dies. Smart people would wait to find out where the impact point was and then move there.[edit 2] Here is a fantastic analysis of a Mars-sized object hitting Earth:What would happen if an asteroid the size of Europe was discovered to undoubtedly be on a collision course with Earth with impact expected in a year?One year isn’t time to do anything about a Europe-sized planet (which is too big to be an asteroid or dwarf planet) headed toward Earth.

Smart people would wait to find out where the impact point was and then move there.[edit 2] Here is a fantastic analysis of a Mars-sized object hitting Earth:This is what happens when a 480km object hits the moon:This is Europe, 3,200km from Portugal to Moscow, so that’s proportionally much larger than the impactor shown above. It’s even beyond the diameter of known dwarf planets and on par with a planet.A 3,200km diameter planet hitting Earth is similar to a repeat of the Theia impact event:Which would look like this (thank you, Stephen Grimmer):The impact side of the planet will be blown into space to a depth comparable to the mantle, wrap around the Earth to bury the far side to some tens of kilometers depth, and then gravity will squish the distorted blob of material back into a sphere (see lunar impact diagram above). The heat released will re-liquefy Earth down to the core.So, yeah, move to the impact point. It’ll be quick-n-painless. Everyone Dies™Some responses to interesting or repeated comments:1. “Will elsewhere be much slower to die?”Yes, somewhat slower. Elsewhere on the planet…Mega-quake deaths and broiling are both a bit slower than having a small planet fall on your head, so there’d be more time for pain.2. Can we nuke it?Sure, you can nuke it but that won’t divert a planet with 1 year before impact. Nuking Planet Doom would just fall under the “embrace hedonism” response, a final3. What if we used all the nukes?Sure, but that won’t divert a planet with 1 year before impact. All the world’s nuclear and conventional arsenals couldn’t replicate a moderately large crater on the moon likeThere are two problems with this situation: 1)I mean, we brag about “destroying Earth” with pollution, whale hunting, microplastics, and Nickelback but, really, we’re just making existence miserable for some complicated chemical reactions on the surface called “organic life.” We’re nowhere near the planet-busting, true planet destruction stage.Anyway…back to nukes and a 1-year countdown to doomsday.A year means that you need to push a planet the size of Europe (3,200km diameter) a minimum of 6 centimeters per second to avoid Earth - if you hit it on day 1 of that year. Assuming you can only muster the response after 6 months then you need to move it at 12 centimeters per second.Assuming this object has the density of water, it is 1.72x10^19kg.Further assuming your nukes will evaporate ice off the surface with an effective exhaust velocity of 250,000m/s (very generous, but within the range of a well-built Orion nuclear pulse drive vehicle) then you need to evaporate 8.6x10^12 kilograms of ice to propel the planet off course.That means you need to evaporate almost 10,000 cubic kilometers of ice, which is beyond the capability of all the worlds’ nukes.Of course, if the nuclear evaporation technique is less efficient and generates a lower exhaust velocity then the amount of ice that has to be evaporated increases exponentially with falling exhaust velocity.So: Given a century or two, all of the world’s nukes and all the nukes we could mass produce in a century or two, sure, we could divert this object.Given a year?Try hedonism, debauchery, and moving to ground zero.4. What about the International Space Station?The ISS would be wiped out as fast as Earth. When the “little” dino-killer asteroid hit 65 million years ago, it’s central plume of debris reached half way to the moon.This planet-sized impact will splash Earth’s crust thousands of miles high, sweeping through Earth orbital space like continent-sized bulldozers. Further, if the ISS had a line-of-sight to the impact then it would probably have been evaporated by the heat flash. Otherwise, it gets to be smashed by debris raining down from above it.An orbit 250 miles (400km) might as well be on the ground for the scale of this impact.","105,627 followers",Dave Consiglio,894,6.8K,91.4M,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-safest-position-to-be-in-if-a-big-asteroid-hits
4,"If a big asteroid hits, then position will make very little difference. It might alter the shape of your charred remains, but other than that, not much will change.Anywhere off-planet would be a good position. So, the ‘safest position’ is in bed on the space station, or the lotus position on Mars, or doing a hand stand on the moon.Basically, just try not to be on Earth, okay? :)","105,627 followers",Dave Consiglio,1.5K,6.8K,91.4M,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-safest-position-to-be-in-if-a-big-asteroid-hits

This is not to say that there isn’t some things worth keeping secret there. But it probably would be in the end a most unexciting trudge across the desert for very long distances in really hot weather to find old computers, old buildings and a few very hot soldiers.The biggest problem with civilians going out there is the “Area 51” is a bombing range. Lots of the area is pretty dangerous to walk around int. I really would recommend people find somewhere else to consider worthy of their time.The reason the US keeps those secret bases out there in Nevada and similar places is that they do test their front line technology there and they like to keep it quiet. Having worked in the development of some of that technology the real stuff is done elsewhere. Nobody really likes to go to the test ranges as they are pretty much very, hot/cold dry unexciting places far from anybody and what gets done is often quite dangerous. That is why it is there.The soldiers tend to have fun because they get to shoot the big guns etc. But in the end everyone is happy to get home and leave the desert behind.","220,168 followers",Franklin Veaux,992,47.3K,779.6M,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-safest-position-to-be-in-if-a-big-asteroid-hits
