I am not actually super well-informed about his life and biography, but I'll indicate roughly the way to think about this question in a way that reflects the real personality of the real Einstein, not Einstein as poster physicist or Einstein as Symbol of the State of Physics.Let's take a serious shot at profiling.He was extremely creative and had startlingly unusual perspectives on things. His talent lay in coming at things from completely weird angles. Angles that others would never have thought of.These traits do NOT map to becoming a finance quant. Or an ad targeting. Those would actually require vastly more energy AND complicated technical proficiency AND a singular lack of aesthetic sensibilities AND a sort of worldly interest in money/visible success that I doubt he had.The profile does not fit.The traits also do not map to some usual suspects list of questions. The problems outlined by Richard Tabassi represent aAn ""end of physics"" state where we can no longer answer the questions we can pose. John Horgan has argued this point of view nicely in his book The End of Science. If so, we're in an angels-on-pinhead state of ""ironic science.""Assuming optimistically that we're in the second kind of state, an Einstein type personality will actually not be able to contribute anything until the current paradigm is ""broken"" by something like the M-M experiment, creating a radically unexpected situation/paradox that requires someone of his talents to put humpty-dumpty together again.This situation favors heavy-lift theoretical systemizers (Edward Witten, J. C. Maxwell, Poincare) with formidable synthetic powers but not necessarily a talent for surprising shifts in perspective or paradox-resolution.I mean think about it: an idea like ""maybe the speed of light is constant for all observers"" is just so completelyThis is the sort of guy who comes in after everything has been devastated by a paradigm failure, and comes up with a new way to put the pieces together. Things aren't exactly working well now, but they aren't shattered.So physics is not actually in a favorable state for an Einstein type personality to do big things. Maybe in 20-30 years if an unexpected experimental result emerges from CERN or somewhere that topples the current models.So is there some other field of human endeavor that would reward an Einstein?I think one possibility is nailing the connection between computing and physics.Another might be making a genuine advance in computational complexity. Possibly casting P != NP in a surprising new light that breaks the impasse of understanding/insight there.A third might be coming up with a true theory of complex networks (scale free graphs and all that sort of thing). Right now, that stuff is a sort of Keplerian-empiricist state.But basically, it is completely unpredictable. What is interesting about the Einsteins of history is that they force very sharp turns in our thinking that we cannot predict before the fact. That's why they're called ""paradigm shifts.""By definition an Einstein is someone who asks the right question rather than answering questions assumed to be the right one.If I could REALLY predict what question an Einstein would work on, I'd be that Einstein.",6 followers,Mats Andersson,18.9K,19.9K,366M,https://www.quora.com/What-might-young-Einstein-ponder-today

All these seem to suggest new forces at play, so our assumption that there are only 4 forces (Strong, Weak, Electromagnetic and Gravitational) is either incorrect or incomplete - probably both.Given that Einstein formulated his theory of general and special relativity based on his understanding of these forces at that time, it is quite likely that he would question the elegance of Relativity given the new observations that are available to us today.In fact, the most curious aspect of Relativity is not that time and space are related, but it is that the speed of light somehow manages to stay constant through all the nerdiness that pervades the (this?) universe. This is interesting as it appears to imply that time (or however we understand it) is constant through the universe.Telescopes enable us to observe 'space', but I am not convinced they allow us to observe 'time'. Let me throw some questions out there:What if the reasons (expanding universe, mainly) that lead us to the theory that dark energy exists are based on inaccurate observations? We may be seeing an expanding 'space' but is 'time' actually constant? What if it isn't? Has anyone considered such an approach?Regardless of what the experts might say about my silly questions above, I know that no question is completely stupid and so the ones I ask above may just be the kind of questions Einstein might be pondering today. It may be that these or such questions end up being completely irrelevant, but it is asking the most insane, even nonsensical questions that lead us down a process of discovery that ends up in a great innovation.[1]",UNKNOWN,Alfredo A.

In some ways, the situation now is analogous to the situation when Einstein developed the theory of relativity.  People already knew that there was a problem, and a lot of very smart people were trying to solve it.  The problem that needed solving was that the laws describing electromagnetism stopped making sense when you considered objects in motion relative to each other.  There was also the question about the ""ether"" - the medium through which light was supposed to travel.  People came up with solutions to the problem, but they were a bit unsatisfying.  Lorentz came up with the idea that objects somehow change their length when they are moving through the ether, according to rules known as Lorentz transformations.  A very strange concept.  It was Einstein's insight that we should stop worrying about how to fit Lorentz transformations into our prior concept of space and time. Instead, he demonstrated that it all makes sense if we just accept that there is no ether and space and time really do depend on relative motion. Then the Lorentz transformations just pop out. This was a bold and brilliant move.  I think there is room for such a bold and brilliant move in the area of fundamental quantum mechanics today.(Note that I am not saying that without zombie Einstein, someone else won't come up with this elegant, consistent interpretation of quantum theory.

The Flash’s feats are flat out ridiculous. Many other posts go into why. These two alone are incredible, but since we can keep going… let’s next pull in: #3 Plastic ManGo try that stuff with the Bat, Bane. Nothing for you here.This guy is damn near indestructible. He doesn’t seem to age, but evolve. He spent 3000 years at the bottom of the ocean as shards and when he was able to pull himself back together, was physically fine (mentally he needed a bit of help, but well, whatcha gonna do?). Telepathic attack? Immune. Physical attack? Not likely. Healing factor? Got one, but barely need it. He is fully functional at the bottom of the ocean as well as on the moon. Plus, this guy can shape shift into just about anything. Mystique is limited to a certain percentage of her mass. Plastic man, not so much. He can shift his mass in either direction (from the size of a building to thin as a sheet of paper to liquid), is capable of generating moving parts within his own body, even adding superhuman strength if he desires. Some of his forms include a fully functioning tank, Batman and a can of bug spray, and I’m barely scratching the surface. So convincing are his transformations he was able to get away with this:Not saying I would do this (though if I had a willing gf we would be the talk of every comicon/social event/formal event/…) but making your body feel like a silky dress is amazing molecular control.Now, with just these three, you can go anywhere, be anyone and no one can get the drop on you, and even if they do, there isn’t much they can do to you. Now for the fun of it, let’s bring some more power in here with: #4 Forge! Wait, Forge? HELL YES FORGE!His power is dual in scale. His mutant power is one of invention and mechanical understanding. He is literally able to invent whatever he needs for a given situation and understand any tech he sees including alien tech. Now give him the added genius of Spider-Man and the speed of thought of the Flash.Is there a crazy powered individual giving the world a hard time with his huge space gun or whatever? By the time the space gun has the trigger half pulled, you’ve already identified what it is, come up with a way to stop it, ran all over the world to get the parts you need, built it, stopped the bad guy, had an ice cream cone and built your parents a new house just for the fun of it, because you should always take care of your family. Now, one other fun thing about Forge is he is a powerful Shaman. Just so we could have magic in this mix of top 5 brand awesomeness.So now, maybe there is some Batman level guy that might be all ‘I could take him with prep’ or a Superman level guy that’s all ‘I could beat him with my sun dips n cold breath or whatevers’. Well, maybe you could somehow. But could you take:All of me? Yep, #5 (6,7, 8,9,10…) is Jamie Madrox - The Multiple Man. Everything I have, times a 1000 plus. I could do everything everywhere all the time. No more excuse to not learn how to play the cello.Seriously, I’ve always loved the cello.If I assign one of my guys - just one - to generate power on a big treadmill or other device? The world has unlimited energy. Assign one of my guys - just one - to cure diseases? The world is cured. You get the idea. Crime? Non-existent if I decide to go on patrol.

Sue can also mentally generate a psionic field of invisible force apparently drawn from hyperspace, which she manipulates for a variety of effectsThis would give me both the powers ofApart from the invisibility, which is already pretty cool, I would get to do things like this:(yes, she is walking on air!)or this:She was able to keep at bay theSo yeah, in case of a2.Blink possesses the power to create a teleportation vacuum in which multiple people or objects can enter at the same time.So yeah, from her I would gain the ability to createScene takenHer effective range is to the moon and back.With this type of teleportation, you can create portals to teleport people or objects even at a long distance (so you don’t have to necessarily touch them), and itsAnd, most importantly of all, this powerWith this I would get to avoid walking my way to school every morning, and I could just create a portal to the Hawaii every time I want to go to the beach. That one concert you cannot go to because it is too far away from the city you live in? Not a problem anymore!Teleportation3.Oh man. This is probably the ability I like the most out of this list. Let’s see what Wikipedia says:Jamie Madrox has the power to create perfect copies of himself, which he calls ""dupes"", and all items on his person (clothing, weaponry, etc.). Each of the duplicates has exactly the same power as Jamie himself, and has independent thought, though Madrox ""Prime"" is usually telepathically and empathically linked to the dupes.CloningI already know how I would divide the roles:And since we are allNow, I’ve previously mentioned how I would keep my powers aWell, thanks to the next superpower I’d choose, that wouldn’t actually be a problem. And that leads me to:4.Now, he is known for his animal shapeshifting skills, which allow him to instantaneously and painlessly turn it any animal he has ever seen.Beast Boy has the ability to morph and transform intoYou might be wondering, hell yeah this is cool, but how would it help you disguise your different clones?Well, I was thinking just the same, that’s why I was actually going to replace him withBut then I stumbled into the following, and changed my mind:According to Wolfman and Perez, the reason as to why Garfield is never seen shapeshifting into other humans,Best Boy is green because of aWhat else could I ask for?Finally, we have reached the last slot. Right know I already have enough powers to live a life full of adventures and, eventually, to protect humankind from any types of extraterrestrial (or something like that) threats.For the final choice I was very undecided on which of the following would actually be the coolest to have:5.Kitty is a mutant with the ability to pass through solid matter by passing her atomic particles through the spaces between the atoms of the object through which she is moving. In this way she and the object through which she is passing can temporarily merge without interacting, and each is unharmed when Shadowcat has finished passing through the object. Kitty can also extend her powers to phase other people and objects.It would just be so cool to be able to walk through walls, jump from incredible heights without any harm (I’d just phase down the floow and then pop-up again) and together with the invisibility ability I could basically become a human-ghost at will (very useful to pull pranks on friends!).I was originally undecided betweenHe is superhumanly acrobatic (speed, agility, dexterity, flexibility, reflexes/reactions, coordination, and balance) being able to evade blows by Spider-Man.

I love the Ghost Rider not only because he's amazing but as well as the fact that he's taken down some heavy hitters.A few of these people include: Doctor Strange, Satana, The Swampthing (I think), Thor, and many more. Some may point to his defeat by Punisher as an exception but this was primarily due to bad writing and secondarily due to plot stupidity.So, from Ghost Rider, I am going to take the source of his powers directly: The Spirit of Vengeance.It has occured to me that I may not be able to control this spirit but I've thought of a solution…Charles Xavier:One of the most, if notI'd use this ability to sort of program my mind to block any and all actions that are not mine (i.e. should the SOV attempt to control me without my permission, this 'algorithm' would block it and give me time to mount a defense against it.)Oh, and that defense? Well…Darwin:He's the unsightly, pale fellow there in the bottom right panel.Regardless of how odd he may look, Darwin is quite the capable young…man…thing.His ability, for those who don't know, is advanced adaptibility. This means that, for example, should he be met with a situation in which he surely wouldn't be able to survive in, like a super P.O.’ed hulk, he'd simply teleport away.Or, if he should find himself in the harsh vacuum of space, his body would get denser and he wouldn't need to breathe to survive anymore.However, this ability isn't limited to his body only. No, it can also affect Darwin's mind. For instance, if you wouldn't mind scrolling back to the image I started this particular character exhibition with, he read some of an alien language as well as had heard it spoken and thus he now can speak and read this alien language.Now, should our little friend The Spirit of Vengeance feel the need to take control of me because it doesn't particularly agree with what I deem necessary, then I'd use this ability (an ability I'd have total control over thanks to Legions ability to basically customize these powers) to find the simplest solution that doesn't involve exorcising the SOV from my body.If I'm being honest, I misread the question. I read that there were to be four super powers instead of five. Tsk, my bad.Guess I'll go with the default…Mobius Chair:The Mobias Chair! Oh goody! I love this one as much as I do our old buddy Spirit Of Vengeance.This chair does the following:Essentially, you are a god whilest on this chair. And yes I know, it has a high physical strain. However, I'm sure the combined powers of Legion, Darwin, and The Spirit of Vengeance are enough to keep me goingOr:Oblivion:Oblivion, nigh omnipotent, and seriously sinister in appearance.
