Hydrogen production was a new feature for HACER and differentiated that power plant design from LANL and LLNL PACER fusion.Above is an artist's conception of a PACER fusion ""energy park ""which shows a large combustion cavern about 1 mile deep and 200 meters in diameter. A deuterium- deuterium fuel charge would be exploded here in the range of a 1 to 20 kiloton TNT yield. The cavity, filled with superheated steam, would absorb and quench the fusion fireball and act as a transport medium to carry thermal energy and by-products.Hacer: A Grand Design for Fusion Powerhttp://wlym.com/archive/fusion/fusion/19801111-fusion.pdfIn the 1950s, after development of the H-bomb, U.S. researchers at LANL and LLNL national laboratories developed a project known as Pacer, aimed at peaceful applications of nuclear explosions. The H- bomb, of course, is typically portrayed as ""uncontrolled"" release of fusion energy using a relatively small fission (A-bomb) trigger. What the Pacer project envisioned was the regular deto­nation of very small fusion bursts optimized for ultra-clean cost effective power generation in carefully designed, steam-filled caverns one mile underground, producing enormous amounts of electricity and, if desired, fissile material for startup of exceptionally clean operating fission reactors like Thorium Molten Salt Reactors or LFTRs.Most appealing about this approach presented by Dr. Seifritz is that there are only minor scientific and technical obstacles to the reali­zation of a Pacer-like power generating systems for harnessing fission-fusion and with only a few additional years of development, pure fusion energy. PACRER fission-fusion power plants could be undertaken immediately, on the basis of field proven existing technology and know-how, guaranteeing com­mercial fusion power within five years in a time frame that matters for solving worldwide climate and energy scarcity problemsWhy were PACER power plants, which would actually been 100X cleaner in terms of production of Minor Actinides and fission product high level nuclear waste, canceled by the Nixon Administration?President Nixon had made campaign promises to the American people to rein in federal spending, and the Nixon Administration searched for ways to trim spending. Leading edge nuclear fusion research, unfortunately, came to the attention of Nixon Administration budget managers and several visionary nuclear technologies then under development including Molten Salt Fission Reactors and PACER fusion were cut as President Nixon tried to keep his promise to the American people in reining in federal spending.In addition, environmental and ""nonproliferation"" arguments were put forward in Congress intending to force discontinuation of the Pacer projects at LANL and LLNL. These arguments, however, lacked technical validity.The underground mounted PACER reactor could be located far away from any community, operate very safely in a conservatively designed underground PACER cavern, and pose no nuclear haz­ards to populated areas of the globe while safely and sustainably producing ultra-clean DD fusion power used to produce commercial electricity.Dr. Ralph Moir led LLL efforts into producing PACER reactors in the mid-1970s.Modern versions of PACER would probably use pure fusion technology.A pure fusion peaceful nuclear explosive (PNE) optimized for ultra-clean power generation is a nuclear device design that does not need a fission ""primary"" to ignite fusion in a secondary stage but rather employs a pure fusion deuterium-tritium primary to ignite a pure deuterium power generating second stage.Pure fusion ICF devices produce small controlled bursts of fusion energy inside of 100 meter deep underground mounted evacuated mini-PACER cavity. When such a small fusion device is initiated inside its stainless steel cylindrical chamber, no shock and no sound is transmitted to the ground above.Vacuum will not permit transmission of sound.Vacuum will not permit transmission of shock.The mini-PACER device produces the Tritium it needs for the DT primary from Tritium produced via the D-D fusion reaction on the preceding shot. Tritium (190 milligrams) need only be supplied from an external source one time on the very first shot. All shots made in the mini-PACER reactor thereafter can be provided from Tritium bred in the reactor from residual Tritium scavenged from the fusion chamber debris left by previous D-D fusion shots. Thus Tritium supply is cheap and sustainable with the modern pure fusion form of PACER ICF; the vast majority of fusion energy produced by the mini-PACER reactor each shot is from cheap and ubiquitous Deuterium fuel separated from sea water.National governments have tended to respond with unreasonable fear to fusion reactor designs that produce power in short controlled fusion bursts. Much less technically mature and more difficult tokamak and stellarator reactors have for decades received funding preferentially over practical demonstrated ICF fusion approaches because they promised smooth power generation from extended continuous fusion burns as opposed to a series of many short, controlled fusion bursts. The reality is that tokamaks and stellarator fusion devices have not in 60 years attained burns producing any significant amount of power for more than a few seconds before the plasma confinement is lost and the fusion reaction stops.Reliable, repeatable, small controlled fusion bursts inside an evacuated chamber designed to safely contain all the radiation generated by fusion reactions is just as safe as the safest magnetic confinement continuous burn experiment. In all cases, the fusion reactions used are the same. Nuclear waste generated are in all cases also the same. Tiny mini-Mike fusion devices are harmless if stolen as they require large stationary lasers or ion beam particle accelerators to ignite them.Underground ICF pure fusion power generation is just as safe as the safest form of fusion that anyone has so far proposed and is a lot more rapidly implementable.Note 1: DOE during the cold war had a well funded and well led program to develop pure fusion experimental devices.(It 	may now be revealed)DOE published in 2001 the following document -RESTRICTED DATA DECLASSIFICATION DECISIONS 1946 TO THE PRESENThttp://www.fas.org/sgp/othergov/doe/rdd-7.htmlcontained in section C of that document are the following facts:Information on the DOE's pure fusion program:(1) Fact that the DOE made a substantial investment in the past to develop a pure fusion experimental explosive device(2) That the U.S. does not have and is not developing a pure fusion weapon; and(3) That no credible design for a pure fusion weapon resulted from the DOE investment. (98-15)(Point 3 may be disputed -Note 2:controlled and uncontrolled –but is this really true?Is there in reality two types of fusion?It is said that in uncontrolled nuclear fusion, vast amounts of energy in uncontrolled manner is released causing destruction only—the hydrogenbomb is an example. Thus uncontrolled nuclear fusion is not viewed as something of use for constructive purpose.It is perceived that in controlled nuclear fusion, the vast energy of fusion reactions is released steadily so it can be used for peaceful purposes, say, for nuclear fusion reactors.But is there really a differenceor is it just a perception?Is it perhaps true that there is really only one type of fusion and depending on the technology and the amount of fuel you use, you get a more or less rapid release of fusion energy.The truth is that during the 1950s, fusion program managers wanting to develop fusion reactors like tokamaks and stellarators sought to dissociate themselves and their fusion technology (good) from thermonuclear fusion weapons technology (bad) which the public feared. The notion of controlled versus uncontrolled fusion was largely public relations and spin employed by AEC fusion program managers to enlist wider public support.While the smoothness and the time of release of energy from fusion may be different, the fusion reactions (Deuterium Tritium or Deuterium-Deuterium) are all the same and the waste products produced (helium and neutrons) are all the same.",829 followers,Robert Gauthier,738,10.6K,3M,https://www.quora.com/Is-it-possible-to-detonate-thermonuclear-devices-in-large-deep-bodies-of-water-to-heat-the-water-then-extract-energy-from-the-heated-water-to-generate-electricity

Such a power plant can be used as a low cost neutron source to transform fertile U238 to fissile Pu239 and to convert fertile Th232 to fissile U233. These generate about 82 trillion joules per kilogram.Here’s what Wikipedia says about abundance of Uranium and Thorium.Naturally occurring uranium is composed of three major isotopes, uranium-238 (99.2739–99.2752% natural abundance), uranium-235 (0.7198–0.7202%), and uranium-234 (0.0050–0.0059%).Thorium [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorium ] is found in small amounts in most rocks and soils [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil ]. Soil commonly contains an average of around 6 parts per million (ppm) of thorium. Thorium occurs in several minerals [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineral ] including thorite [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorite ] (ThSiO4), thorianite [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thorianite ] (ThO2 + UO2) and monazite [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monazite ]. Thorianite is a rare mineral and may contain up to about 12% thorium oxide. Monazite [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monazite ] contains 2.5% thorium, allanite [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allanite ] has 0.1 to 2% thorium and zircon [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zircon ] can have up to 0.4% thorium. Thorium-containing minerals occur on all continents. Thorium is several times more abundant in Earth's crust than all isotopes of uranium [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotopes_of_uranium ] combined and thorium-232 is several hundred times more abundant than uranium-235.Thorium concentrations near the surface of the earth can be mapped using gamma spectroscopy [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_spectroscopy ]. The same technique has been used to detect concentrations on the surface of the Moon; the near side [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near_side_of_the_Moon ] has high abundances of relatively thorium-rich KREEP [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KREEP ], while the Compton–Belkovich Thorium Anomaly [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compton%E2%80%93Belkovich_Thorium_Anomaly ] was detected on the far side [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_side_of_the_Moon ]. Martian [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars ] thorium has also been mapped by 2001 Mars Odyssey [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2001_Mars_Odyssey ].Th232 decays very slowly (its half-life [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life ] is comparable to the age of the universe) but other thorium isotopes [ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotope ] occur in the thorium and uranium decay chains.

Well, we don’t know how, without first heating a furnace up to about 100,000,000°C. For comparison, coal power plants burn coal at about 2,000°C, and nuclear fission keeps their fuel rods at between 300 - 600°C.100 million degrees is not possible with current technologies. Well… it is, but it’s not pretty. Modern large-yield nuclear weapons in the megaton range, are actually fusion bombs (as opposed to the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima & Nagasaki in WW2, which were fission reaction bombs). Fusion bombs actually have fission “atomic bombs” wrapped around them, and use that nuclear explosion to create the 100 million degree heat required to get the fusion bomb ignited.There are a lot of ongoing experiments, in a lot of different countries, to attempt to make a working fusion reactor which would not require insane amounts of energy to heat up enough to start the fusion reaction, or to develop a process of “cold fusion”, but as of the current day, we do not know of a way to make such a device.","220,150 followers",Franklin Veaux,3.2K,47.3K,779.4M,https://www.quora.com/How-can-we-make-fusion-an-economic-way-to-generate-electricity

5,"IF controlled nuclear fusion someday becomes a reality (after 70 years of research it’s still a ways off), and yes, it does provide much more energy per unit mass than fission, it will help some with space travel but it won’t be the magic key to get us to the stars.

Now IF we were able to extract most of that energy AND channel all of it into propulsive energy to accelerate the ship, AND if we stored a huge amount of both D and T in propellant tanks, it still would not get us anywhere close to relativistic speeds. This also presumes that a way will be found to extract the neutron’s energy, which is 80% of the total —- being neutral, it can’t be focused like the He can, thus channeling the neutron’s 14.1 MeV will be a difficult technical challenge. So let’s say your objective is to get to 10% of c (speed of light), meaning a 100 light-year journey to a distant star would take “only” one thousand years, then you’d have to convert mass equal to 0.5% of the ship’s total mass (including fuel) to propulsive energy. If HALF of that mass was D-T fuel, and your energy conversion-propulsion systems were 100% efficient, you’d only be converting 0.5*17.6/4693 = 0.19% of your mass to energy, far short of 0.5%. 0.19% would get the ship to 6.2% of c, a respectable speed BUT that assumes perfect efficiency. Dropping to an overall systems-wide realistic efficiency of 50%, the terminal velocity drops to 4.4% of c (but that’s 8200 miles/second!). However, there would probably be additional propulsive methods employed, such as using giant space-based lasers or solar mirrors to focus onto an ablative rear member that would literally push the ship forward with radiation pressure until it’s out of range, and solar sails that accomplish the same thing, but at a much lower level for a longer period of time. Bottom line, fusion will most likely be a candidate energy source for interstellar propulsion, but it won’t be the final answer.","220,150 followers",Franklin Veaux,1.6K,47.3K,779.4M,https://www.quora.com/Nuclear-fission-versus-nuclear-fusion-which-would-provide-more-energy-If-its-the-nuclear-fusion-that-provides-a-ton-more-of-energy-dont-you-think-that-the-nuclear-fusion-could-be-best-in-helping-us-developing-energy

7,"No. The amount of energy “trapped” in a nucleon is a U-shaped curve bottoming out at Iron-56. If you fuse nuclei lighter than this, you can get energy out. If you split nuclei heavier than this, you can get energy out. But to go past the minimum you have to put energy in, not get it out.

That’s why JET was retro-fitted with remote handling equipment, to allow the radioactive chamber lining to be replaced, and why ITER will have this remote handling gear from day one. JET produced far more nuclear waste than a fission reactor would have produced in releasing the same amount of energy.There’s also the problem of providing the Tritium. ITER will use Tritium created in a fission reactor. It is hoped that its successors DEMO and PROTO will produce all of their own Tritium, but they will need to use fission to do so, which will again produce radioactive waste.There are proposals to useSo no, there’s currently no foreseeable way of avoiding the production of this radioactive waste.

They are a much better short term option to fusion power. Potentially small, transportable reactors could be in production within 10 years. Given enough support and investment.A number of different types are available. The next step is the construction of prototype reactors. To prove they are safe and efficient. China is leading in the construction of Gen 4 reactors.China has just started operation of a gas cooled, pebble bed reactor prototype fission reactor. It uses sphere fuel pebbles protected by layers of highly heat resistant material. Including ceramics, silicon, carbides, graphene and carbon materials. Able to tolerate temperatures of over 1000 degrees. Much hotter than the operating temperatures of PWR, Pressurised Water Reactors, using metal fuel rods and Uranium fuel pellets.These gas cooled reactors can operate at temperatures that would melt solid fuel rods. These reactors are also far easier to operate. Even without coolant, pumps or electrical power these reactors can cool effectively with natural air convection cooling. The fuel can be burnt far more effectively. The pebbles are easily removed, checked, reused or replaced without closing down the reactor.Other possible options are Molten Salt Reactors and sodium-cooled reactors. These reactors can also use a variety of cheap and abundant fuel. Cleaner and cheaper than enriched Uranium. They can use nuclear or mining waste as well as un-used weapons material.

It is remarkable that we (as a species) are even attempting it and more remarkable that we may well succeed.People seem to think that fusion is relatively easy, but itThere’s a reason stars burn for billions of years, they really only burn slowly.Now consider the conditions at the core of the sun - 250 billion atmospheres, 15 million degrees (K or C doesn’t matter at this scale). And that is sufficient to make a piddly amount of heat per cubic metre. Scaled down to operations that would fit on Earth, that’s not going to cut it for power generation. You’d get more power out of a single large solar panel in good conditions. (That might seem odd but consider the sheer size of the sun, even “just” the core region).What’s more, we can’t achieve those sorts of pressures so we need much higher temperatures before we even start fusion; closer to 100 million degrees. We then need to surround this heating zone with the kind of insulation a few hundred thousand miles worth of mind-bogglingly dense gas and plasma provides (using superpowered magnets), andI hope this gives you an idea of what an achievement creating a working fusion power plant will be. It should be considered like the Manhattan project or Apollo programme but way,It should be awe inspiring, and I hope I’ve conveyed a little of that awe.Here’s a photo of the pit in which they’re building the core at ITER. For scale, there is a person standing on the extreme left of the image about halfway down (9 o’clock position). The pressure vessel (the first section of which is complete and slowly making its way into this pit) will contain more steel than the Eiffel tower. Once running, the core will be the hottest place in the solar system, in fact it’ll be hotter than anywhere within around 100 light years of Earth as only blue supergiant stars get this hot at their cores.And ITER is just the small scale prototype. A final generating power plant will be significantly larger.I hope that blows your mind at least a little.","105,625 followers",Dave Consiglio,4.4K,6.8K,91.4M,https://www.quora.com/How-can-we-make-fusion-an-economic-way-to-generate-electricity

My former father-in-law also worked at Lawrence Berkeley Labs, and was an engineer designing superconducting coil magnets and had decades of experience working with fusion researchers, even though his primary application was particle accelerators. From having many long conversations with these very intelligent and qualified people I realized that there are some really hard problems that block practical fusion, with no immediate solutions in sight.The only place we know of working, large-scale, energy-generating fusion reactions is at the center of a star, where the gravity of the massive star creates the necessary density, temperature, and time being held in that state at the core for fusion reactions to run continuously. This is called the Lawson criteria, and is hard to achieve. All of the layers of the star above that act as an energy exchanger, converting all the gamma rays and fast neutrons at the core into progressively less energetic wavelengths of light and motion of nuclei (heat) so by the time they reach the surface of the star, that energy is emitted as IR and visible light that heats and powers our planet's biosphere, and can provide photovoltaic energy to us as well. All of our efforts in fusion have been to try and reproduce this process on earth, in a small reactor that can provide practical energy.First I will talk aboutThe first problem with magnetic confinement is fundamental - no matter how strong or well formed the magnetic field containing the plasma is, it will always leak, as positive nuclei or ions spiralling around the magnetic field lines collide and scatter, eventually drifting out of the containment field. The only known solution is to make the reactor larger so the scattering ions take longer to travel to the plasma boundary, and thus more fusion can happen during that time. Pretty brute force.The world's most advanced magnetic confinement fusion power plant is ITER, which, to reduce the ion scattering problem mentioned above, is 6-stories tall and about the same dimension in diameter, containing the mass of 3 Eiffel towers, and it is still not expected to be large enough to contain a plasma long enough to sustain burning and produce continuous energy generation.A more practical problem is how do we extract the energy? Most of the energy in deuterium-tritium fusion reactions is released in fast, high-energy neutrons, which (because they are neutral, and have no electric charge) are not confined by the magnetic field, don't heat up the plasma, and have to be stopped by a thick shield, which then heats up, and can vaporize water to steam in order to power turbines and electrical generators. The problem is the constant bombardment by neutrons makes the shield material degrade with time, and become very radioactive, posing a problem for removal and disposal.Also, deuterium-tritium fusion reactions are currently used because they take place at the lowest energies and at the lowest plasma temperatures of all the possible fusion fuels, and thus are easier to ignite and keep lit. However, tritium is not found naturally in any significant quantities and needs to be manufactured in nuclear reactors. With today's production capacity, we just cannot make enough tritium to power even ITER continuously. We could use better fuels, like Helium-3 or Boron-11, which do not emit neutrons and thus 'burn clean', but the plasma temperature must be much higher and the confinement much better to ignite fusion and sustain it with these fuels. And while Boron-11 is plentiful, Helium-3 is so rare that scientists think that the best source of it is lunar regolith that has been irradiated for billions of years on the moon's surface. Any energy generation infrastructure that requires a regular supply of a moon-based fuel, even as energy dense as He3, will probably never work out.A proposed solution to the Tritium deficit is to construct the shield surrounding the reactor with lithium, which is abundant, and fissions into tritium when struck by neutrons, thereby 'breeding' tritium within the reactor itself. Of course, this comes with its own set of problems of how to capture, purify, and contain the tritium after it is released into the tokamak reaction chamber from the walls.Another issue is that when all of the superconducting magnets in ITER are running at full current (160,000 amps) to create the 13 Tesla toroidal magnetic field (13x that in an MRI machine) and to create the other plasma-shaping and heating fields, they are storing 60 GigaJoules, or around 12 Tons of TNT worth of energy. This is because the 180 kilometers of superconducting Niobium-Tin wires in all these massive magnet coils can carry enormous electrical current when supercooled with liquid helium.More info on the ITER magnets:But, if that cooling fails, the superconductor heats up, quenches, and becomes a normal conductor, and can no longer carry that enormous current. With 160,000 amps suddenly meeting resistance, the coil rapidly vaporizes, and causes a meltdown of the other coils, with a total energy release of 12 tons of TNT. This is very undesirable, especially when those coils are wrapped around a highly radioactive shield that also vaporizes and is expelled into the atmosphere. There are fault-detection systems, but it takes a while to dissipate that amount of energy safely, and there may not be enough time to react quickly enough in the event of a catastrophic magnet coil failure.So, some gotchas left to solve for practical fusion energy generation with magnetic confinement, with some perhaps not so easily solved.Inertial confinement fusionIt also has many of the same problems with energy conversion to electricity, and much worse wear and tear on the shielding from these small nuclear fusion explosions being set off, which also trashes all the precision equipment needed to hold the fuel pellet in the focus of the converging laser beams with extreme accuracy. So, a lot of practical damage control problems before inertial confinement fusion is a practical source of energy generation.While these problems may be solved, practical application is still a very long way off, and currently the main application of inertial confinement fusion is as an experimental testbed for calibrating computer codes used to simulate and design thermonuclear fusion weapons. As horrific as these weapons may be, the simulation codes developed for designing them (sorry maintaining them), are the one of the greatest tools for innovation in fusion energy. There is a hydrodynamics code which simulates the behavior of the fissile (and fusion) materials under extreme conditions of pressure and temperature, as well as transport codes that model neutron transport and scattering in the materials under these conditions, and many other bits and bobs. They are all standard numerical techniques, and the really classified part is the integration and calibration of all these codes with previous nuclear weapon tests from the past, and with these small scale simulations in the present.Electrostatic Confinement FusionBasically you need a vacuum container the size of a basketball and a pump to empty it. You put a small spherical wire cage the size of a golf ball in the center, and a larger wire cage the size of a bowling ball around it. You then pump out all the air, and apply a very large (10,000V) electrical potential between the two cages, with the small negative cathode at the center, and the positive anode at the periphery.Then you open a valve and let in a very small amount of Deuterium gas (commercially available) into the vacuum chamber, and it ionizes in the large voltage potential, the D+ ions in the periphery experience a very strong electric field (100K V/m), and are rapidly accelerated towards the center of the reactor, with enough energy to collide and fuse the deuterium nuclei (no tritium required). This fusion can be measured with an external neutron counter.Theoretically, power generation would be simple, as the fusion products consisting of highly energetic He3 and (few) H3 ions could be decelerated in an electric field and the current from that used to generate electricity directly.Here is ECG Herman’s excellent thesis paper on designing and constructing a Farnsworth Fusor:Although they seem like a obvious winners due to their simplicity and effectiveness, ECF reactors have several things limiting scaling:a) There is a limit to the deuterium gas density before performance degrades, so generation capacity is limited.b) Deuterium ions tend to collide with the wire cage cathode in the center, which absorbs them, heating the cage, and causing energy loss and contamination from metal atoms being dislodged.c) As the deuterium ions oscillate back and forth through the center, each time they change direction, they emit bremsstrahlung radiation, or photons of light, losing energy (this is how your dentist’s x-ray machine works).d) Scattering tends to reduce the nice, radial trajectories of the ions into a Maxwellian distribution over time, reducing the fusion that occurs.There has been work in using electromagnets at the periphery to try and hold a ball of electrons in the center, eliminating the need for a central cage… akaThermonuclear WeaponsIn the Teller-Ulam, two-stage, thermonuclear weapon, a spherical plutonium fission primary (with deuterium-tritium fusion fuel at the core to boost it) is imploded by conventional explosives, the plutonium is crushed far beyond critical density, fissions and detonates. The initial radiation released is contained and focused onto the fusion secondary to implode it, ignite fusion, and detonate it. I just mention this to illustrate the enormous energy needed to really reach the Lawson criteria in a large scale, but nuclear weapons kind of freak me out, so I'm going to refer you to the link to the Wikipedia article about them if you want to read more:Thermonuclear weapon - WikipediaSo, in summary, we should not shut down or stop building today's fission nuclear reactors, as commercial fusion reactors are not only far in the future, but also produce radioactive waste (their shielding, which needs to be periodically replaced), and Tokamaks can melt down catastrophically and explode if there is a cooling failure in the magnet coils during full power operation. They also do not run on seawater, like some say. We need expensive and difficult to produce tritium (which is also radioactive) to ignite fusion at the temperatures and densities that today's tokamak magnetic fields can produce.To advance fusion energy in your career, I think the best fields to study would be physics (classical, electrodynamics, plasma, quantum, nuclear…) and computer science, with a focus on numerical simulation. The actual physical fusion reactors are so expensive and time-consuming to build, test, and operate, that you may only get to iterate designs once or twice in a career, but computer simulations can take us in so many different directions more cheaply and easily by comparison.Perhaps there is some exotic stellarator magnetic confinement design, or advanced Farnsworth electrostatic confinement design that has not been explored in depth, that will turn out to hold the key to fusion energy. Simulation is probably the best first step to find it, unless you have a few billion dollars and several hundred kilometers of Niobium-Tin wire and helium cooling tubing to play with.Brent",UNKNOWN,Viktor T.

In theory once you have that, you have your essentially limitless energy source. It’s not actually limitless, but there is enough water in the Solar system to maintain our level of civilization on nothing but fusion power for billions (yes, with a B) of years, well beyond when the Sun runs out of hydrogen.On the other hand all of these projects are very far from being useful. See, producing more energy in plasma than what you put in via magnets is an important milestone, but the one you should be looking at is not the energy of plasma, it’s the energy you can harvest from that plasma. It’s mostly thermal energy and the conversion factor of that to electric power is usually around 1/2. So even these reactors won’t actually be producing more electric power than what they need to power them. They’d have to produce approximately twice that much just to break even.But wait, breaking even still only means you’re running the reactor without external input. You aren’t putting any energy in the grid yet at this point, all you’re doing is producing small quantities of helium. For the reactor to become commercially viable, it needs to produce energy far in excess of that and you need to account for energy needed to generate adequate deuterium and possibly tritium to run the core.That’s why even the furthest advanced fusion reactors are still very far removed from being useful as a power source. It is hoped that once we manage to produce a reactor that will put more energy out than it needed to run it, smaller incremental improvements will follow quickly and the next two steps will not need an exorbiant amount of time. Math seems to suggest we’ll be able to extract several times the energy we put in, that’s why these projects are being financed in the first place.But don’t count on fusion power plant construction starting in mid-2030s either.
