Before mass adoption, some were predicting it would be the next big thing, others dismissed it. From the electric light to the automobile, history is full of powerful innovations that initially looked like fads.But in each case, there came a point where adoption spiked. The costs fell. The benefits became obvious. Barriers to adoption were overcome.When I look back at the Internet pre-mass adoption, I see a lot of similarities with blockchain in its current state. It has incredible potential to change the way we live, but I can also see that it needs some work before we’ll see mass adoption.Lessons From The PastThe World Wide Web was created in 1991, but there were no browsers for it until 1993. It wasn’t until the creation of Netscape Navigator in 1994 that adoption began to accelerate.Netscape introduced the idea that the Internet should be for everyone. They created a consistent browsing experience across operating systems—something we take for granted now. And they made it all available free of charge. In effect, Netscape opened the floodgates for mass adoption of the internet.User Friendly WalletsFive billion people now have a mobile phone connection. In our current era, mobile devices have allowed billions of people to connect to the Internet and granted them access to information, even in remote locations. What mobile phones have done to accelerate proliferation of internet, blockchain clients will do for adoption of blockchain. One thing that’s holding blockchain back right now is the lack of user-friendly wallets—or clients--on mobile devices. Ease of use is key. It’s difficult to get people to use something if it actually makes daily life more complicated. As it stands, the general population doesn’t have access to mobile wallets that allow them to make payments with cryptocurrency.But blockchain doesn’t just need wallets, although making payments is what most people think about doing first. After all, people will want to spend their cryptocurrency. Blockchain’s Netscape is going to be something even more universal than money transfer.Where Is Blockchain’s Netscape?Like the Internet 1.0, blockchain is also a network that’s missing interfaces and browsers. What it needs is something that’s so user friendly, so elegant, that the user doesn’t know that they’re using blockchain.There are multiple ways that this could work.Imagine being able to sell your car, or even your house, via a simple asset ownership and transfer app. A decentralized DMV or Deed of Title would mean that you could find and buy a car on Autotrader. You could sell your house on Zillow. It would all be secured and authenticated on a blockchain.What about a literal browser for all the things in your vicinity? IoT devices, all registered to a blockchain, could then be “browsed” by users. At Chronicled, we’ve already developed an app to do just that, called Discover. It allows you to view and authenticate IoT devices that are within range. But we could be moving even further beyond apps or browsers and into actual infrastructure as blockchain technology matures.After Netscape?Netscape is no more. The browser wars with Microsoft in the 90s put it on a downward trajectory. But the Internet has only become more powerful and more deeply ingrained in our everyday lives. The same is going to happen with blockchain.The real innovation, that killer app that sets off mass adoption of blockchain, will power the machine to machine economy. In the M2M economy I envision, drones can self-authenticate, enter your home, and deliver a package. Amazon Key is already allowingIn a blockchain-connected future, I see homes that are connected to smart grids. They harvest their own wind and solar power and sell it back to the electric company, or even their neighbors. Manufacturing is directed by smart machines that determine demand and availability, then produce goods only as needed—all while paying the necessary parties through smart contracts.Will that vision come to pass? Maybe not immediately, but when blockchain has its Netscape moment, things are going to move quickly. Did anyone working on the World Wide Web in the early 90s envision exactly how we use the Internet today? I doubt it. And I think the same can be said about blockchain.I envision a fully automated, machine to machine economy, but is that what’s best for society? How different will my vision be from what actually comes to pass? It’s difficult to say. But this isn’t a technology that any of us can afford to ignore. Because blockchain’s Netscape moment is coming, and it may be here sooner than you think.","129,086 followers",Jessica Su,1.5K,1.5K,49.6M,https://www.quora.com/The-internet-was-extremely-inaccessible-in-the-early-days-until-Netscape-made-it-much-easier-for-the-general-public-to-browse-the-internet-What-could-be-the-%E2%80%9CNetscape%E2%80%9D-for-Blockchain-and-cryptocurrencies-what-kind-of-program-is-required

2,"Definitely, AVAX and SOL are huge projects in the blockchain ecosystem. They have a huge community backing and the teams behind them are solid. This means we will see improvements being made on each one of them. New improvements will translate to superior technology and the demand is bound to grow. What I believe is that gradual growth is expected but no one can really tell if they will reach the current market cap of Ethereum. However, mass adoption of cryptocurrency globally might be a big boost in seeing the entire crypto market cap hyper-surging.","84,494 followers",Adam Fayed,1.4K,0,0,https://www.quora.com/The-internet-was-extremely-inaccessible-in-the-early-days-until-Netscape-made-it-much-easier-for-the-general-public-to-browse-the-internet-What-could-be-the-%E2%80%9CNetscape%E2%80%9D-for-Blockchain-and-cryptocurrencies-what-kind-of-program-is-required
3,"False narrative because bitcoin is not bad for the environment. There are new sustainable ways of mining bitcoin today with the use of solar power, wind power, etc.That being said, if there were cryptocurrencies better for the environment, it wouldn't still overtake bitcoin in value. For example, solarcoin, stellar, cardano, bitgreen, ripple etc. are all reportedly better for the environment than bitcoin but none has better value than bitcoin and none will in the future.","99,872 followers",Alcatraz Dey,9K,1.4K,68M,https://www.quora.com/The-internet-was-extremely-inaccessible-in-the-early-days-until-Netscape-made-it-much-easier-for-the-general-public-to-browse-the-internet-What-could-be-the-%E2%80%9CNetscape%E2%80%9D-for-Blockchain-and-cryptocurrencies-what-kind-of-program-is-required

7,"“Blockchain Technology” is the latest gee-whiz, recognizable-name-brand marvel that’s supposed to revolutionize everything from money to electricity.In fact, it’s a minor improvement in Accounting methodology, useful in some industries but not especially necessary; there are usually other ways to do the job.

8,"Not specific to US but applicable to any country. The electricity market has utilities on the supply side and consumers on the demand side, with blockchain you can integrate consumers with renewable power assets like solar, wind into the local grid to act as Prosumers.

The electricity market has utilities on the supply side and consumers on the demand side, with blockchain you can integrate consumers with renewable power assets like solar, wind into the local grid to act as Prosumers. The inherent de-centralized nature of blockchain technology allows to create a network of multiple nodes embedded into the electricity distribution grid creating a so called smart grid. The blockchain acts as the accounting ledger for such a grid storing the transaction records of production and consumption by each prosumer/consumer for billing purposes. This allows to create a more competitive market where the prices cannot be dictated by utilities alone.**EDIT**To further expand the above, consider a distribution grid with prepaid meters for consumers. Normally consumers would load the amount in the meter wallet based on their estimated consumption. They would thus buy the power from the utility at fixed rate and consume that many units until their wallet balance is exhausted.Now consider this in a blockchain scenario, you can replace the fiat with say an ERC-20 token, where each token is pegged to the price of 1 unit of electricity. You then define the smart contract which governs the use of the token. The network will have an infinite supply of these tokens, and while tokens can be bought or sold, the consumption of electricity units would deplete the tokens from the network, meaning they get destroyed and cannot be recovered.So within the grid, you have the power producing utility which produces say 1000 units daily and decides to sell the same at 10¢ per token, you the consumer who consumes 100 units daily, purchases these tokens from the utility and is allowed to consume that many units of electricity. Next, I move into your area and put up solar on my house that generates 150 units daily. I utilize the 100 units I need internally and export surplus power of 50units back into the grid for say 5¢ per token. Suddenly you now have an option to procure power at less rates, 50x10¢ from the utility and 50x5¢ from me your neighbor. Multiply this scenario 1000 fold and you now have a very dynamic and competitive market where the price can no longer be dictated by the utility, while giving a chance to those with renewable assets to capitalize on their investments.",4 followers,Dan Bradbury,1K,21.7K,235.2M,https://www.quora.com/The-internet-was-extremely-inaccessible-in-the-early-days-until-Netscape-made-it-much-easier-for-the-general-public-to-browse-the-internet-What-could-be-the-%E2%80%9CNetscape%E2%80%9D-for-Blockchain-and-cryptocurrencies-what-kind-of-program-is-required

I am going to share what has led to my misanthropic nihilism and negativity concerning the current “state of affairs.”Even with our greater technology, I-Phones, computers, medical advances, and other luxuries, these problems lessen us every day, and not enough people care to do a damn thing about it. Obsessive greed is one of the things we most need to tackle, from big corporations to medicine and higher education. Money is important but we have allowed that obsession to get in the way of the higher interest of caring for all our citizens. Making all their needs more affordable and obtainable is a good start. I am thankful I do not have kids. I would grieve incessantly now to think of the world I have brought them into. I only hope that younger people are observing this disaster and that they will take the reigns and make some needed changes. It may be too late.* To the few folks (including a lady who was so rude I deleted her comment) who think we should love the country as it is or “get out,” I say this. Such reactions are naive and juvenile. I love my country and I wish to see it become better. Civilizations do not progress through complacency. They advance when folks sound alarms and encourage change. That is why women and minority groups now have rights they would never have enjoyed had they just “loved it or got out.”",0 followers,Mark Adler,2.5K,755,2M,https://www.quora.com/If-a-cryptocurrency-were-developed-that-was-good-for-the-environment-would-it-overtake-Bitcoin-in-value-Why-or-why-not
