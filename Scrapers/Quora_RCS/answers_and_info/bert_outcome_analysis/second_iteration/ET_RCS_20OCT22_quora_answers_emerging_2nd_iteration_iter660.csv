I'm sorry, but I can't answer what those asymmetries mentioned in the article,Back to the general question, does it prove or disprove the numerical simulation process? No, only a special case of it when the simulation is done on a lattice, and only then if experiments are done to observe the observables mentioned in the article and decide the question. (Since there's no reason to think that we're in such a simulation, it would be foolish to spend money to find out.)Could we detect that we're in a simulation (not one based on a lattice)?  I see no reason why we could. Does it matter?

2,"Do the Kaiju get magical super armor skin or not?Because in the movie for whatever reason, punches and blades work but conventional kinetic weapons… Don’t?Obviously, if they have even half realistic exoskeletons, just go get some artillery and blast them.We already have the perfect weapon- a 5 inch shell traveling at far higher velocity than conventional artillery (great for armor penetration!) And it’s already mounted on tons of ships!It looks dinky on a ship, but that’s the same size as a tank cannon.Do the Kaiju get magical super armor skin or not?Because in the movie for whatever reason, punches and blades work but conventional kinetic weapons… Don’t?Obviously, if they have even half realistic exoskeletons, just go get some artillery and blast them.We already have the perfect weapon- a 5 inch shell traveling at far higher velocity than conventional artillery (great for armor penetration!) And it’s already mounted on tons of ships!It looks dinky on a ship, but that’s the same size as a tank cannon.Okay, okay, that’s anti climatic even though the physics is the same. You want some climactic action? Good thing Uncle Sam keeps these floating:1945 was a great vintage.I’m sure we can whip up some 16” AP shells for these. We know they work against at least 26 inch thick steel armor:Unless these Kaiju are made of solid metal this will work.No? You want magical immunity to explodey bits?Well if swords work then we can do way better than giant robots to deliver the coup de grace. First we call NASA/Elon musk. We put a modified sword on a rocket up to space. It will orbit over the ocean. When Kaiju show up, we simply drop the sword (which has thrusters and guidance computers) from space and slam it right into that Kaiju at reentry speeds.We can call it the Janitor Program because it will absolutely mop these Kaiju upThink “Rods from god” or the Fractional Orbital Bombardment System. It’s also way cheaper to have orbiting swords than to build these damn robot suits.No? You think weaponizing space is for cowardly poltroons?Fine. New plan: Kaiju are silicon based. Now, the exact chemistry of silicon based life is not clear but there are a number of angles of attack here. They are also apparently quite acidic. You know what else is silicon based and acidic? Caulk. And you can spray vinegar on it to dissolve it. So… have one of those fire fighting planes dump some vinegar on those suckers and watch them squirm. Failing vinegar, there are many far more potent industrial chemicals to use, though I went for the biodegradable option.Apply to Kaiju and scrub vigorously.If that still isn’t acceptable, my next plan is to take the corpse of a Kaiju - specifically the armor plating - sharpen them, and use those as the basis for “kaiju buster” munitions. I think the movie has them self destruct into acidic blood. But some of this plating has to survive. If Kaiju blood can dissolve the plating then my god, just spray them with their own blood.My final plan is to just take the nuclear weapons that we know work on these bastards and use them far more effectively. First of all, none of this tactical weapon nonsense. We are dialing it right to “tsar bomba.” Put it in a submarine and shove it through that portal, like they should have done instead of sending a giant robot.

6,"In reality all we’d have to do is let the Kaiju collapse under their weight. Creatures that large would be too heavy to stand, let alone move or fight, or breathe. They would be like whales that stranded themselves on the beach; all we’d have to do is let them suffocate as their lungs were crushed under their weight.","45,928 followers",Steven Haddock,12.9K,25.5K,341.9M,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-most-scientific-option-to-defend-the-world-against-Kaiju-other-than-building-Jaegers
7,"The first and most important thing about Kaiju is that they all come out of one place: The Portal. This portal is one way (most of the time), doesn’t change location, and best of all we know where it is. This means we could just surround the portal in a massive block of concrete and potentially prevent the Kaiju from being able to exist the portal in the first place.However it could be argued that the Kiaju shown in the movie would be able to dig through the cement block eventually. If so we would then want so sort of weaponized defense system permanently set up around the portal.

If so we would then want so sort of weaponized defense system permanently set up around the portal. When considering any weapon system it’s important to note that Kaiju blood is toxic to the environment. Therefore we should be prioritizing weapons that don’t cause Kaiju blood to be spilled. My first suggestion for this would be charging the water with electricity whenever an event happens. A few gigawatts of power should do the trick.The other option would be to use conventional weapons like depth charges (albeit massive ones) and just contain the gore with some sort of structure. Assuming Kaiju blood is equal or greater density than sea water you shouldn’t need anything much taller than the Kaiju themselves and it wouldn’t have to be covered.Basically making giant humanoid robots should have been the last thing they came up with. However their inclusion does make for a much more attention grabbing movie.","29,763 followers",Tomaž Vargazon,922,7.6K,248.6M,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-most-scientific-option-to-defend-the-world-against-Kaiju-other-than-building-Jaegers
8,"Because creatures this size could not exist in the real world thanks to the square cubed law. Which means the creatures would be crushed by their own weight alone, and it would not even matter. The rules of physics apply to all of us and the Kaiju’s would be no different. There would be no need to build Jaegers or use any other military force to take them out. But if we were to talk about total fiction the best bet we would have to fight against these kaijus is Godzilla and his allies.
