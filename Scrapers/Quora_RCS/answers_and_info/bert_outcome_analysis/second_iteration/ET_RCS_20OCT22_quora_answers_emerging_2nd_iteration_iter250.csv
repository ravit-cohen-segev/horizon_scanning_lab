The quantity of deuterium in the world’s oceans is estimated at 4.6 x 10^13 metric tons. Deuterium present in seawater will yield around 5 x 10^11 TW-years of energy. In the year 2017 the entire planet consumed around 17 TW-years of energy, which means that the energy content of the deuterium in seawater would be enough for 29.5 billion years of energy supply.To give all 10 billion people expected to live on the planet in 2050 the level of energy prosperity we in the developed world are used to, a continuous average use of power of 6 kilowatts per person as is typical in Europe, we would need to generate 60 terawatts as a planet—the equivalent of 900 million barrels of oil per day.The time since the earth first formed = 4.54 billion years.The time until the sun burns out = 5 billion years.The deuterium in the sea is capable of completely powering planet earth at a level of 60 Terawatts for 8.33 billion years(longer than the earth has existed or the sun will burn).------Large tokamak magnetic fusion designers often tend to discount the deuterium-deuterium (D-D) fusion reaction because it is not possible to achieve the necessary fusion reaction rates and break-even energy with D-D fusion using tokamaks and stellarator devices such as we currently are able build. The situation is different, however, with Inertial Confinement Fusion which typically employs a fusion plasma that are literally 10^11 times more dense than the typical ion plasma densities used in MCF tokamaks or stellarators.The power than can be drawn from a plasma at fusion conditions is proportional to the second power of the plasma ion density. Even small improvements in plasma ion density will result in significant improvements in the performance of a fusion experiment.There is an impressively large Range of plasma density in current and planned fusion experimentsThere is literally a factor of 10^10 to 10^11 difference in plasma ion density between MCF and ICF fusion experiments. This large difference has implications for commercial fusion technology as the denser the plasma, the more power that can be realized from a fusion burn and the smaller the physical fusion reactor can be while achieving fusion energy with energy gain.The D-D reaction takes place at higher temperatures than can typically be achieved in magnetic confinement tokamaks and typically has a lower fusion cross section leading to lower fusion reaction rates on earth relative to D-T fusion .D-D fusion is more complex and proceeds with multiple fusion side reactions, but when all of the side-chains run to completion, D-D fusion actually produces more energy than D-T fusion per starting mass of reactants. D-D fusion produces T and He3, which in a secondary reaction burn with D. This was practically demonstrated in early thermonuclear tests like the 10 Megaton Ivy Mike fission triggered deuterium experimental test in 1952.D-D fusion does normally produce TritiumD-D Fusion of Deuterium fuel produces energy through four reactions:D + D -> He-3 + n + 3.268 MeVD + D -> T + p + 4.03 MeV(side chains)D + T -> He-4 + n + 17.588 MeVHe-3 + D -> He-4 + p + 18.34 MeVThe net effect of these four fusion reactions taken together is:6 D -> 2 He-4 + 2p + 2n + 43.243 MeV-------Fusion and neutronsDT and DD fusion release large amounts of their fusion energy in the form of fast neutrons.The task of shielding fast neutrons requires• Fast Neutrons (E >1 MeV) must first be thermalized with highneutron scattering materials (typically materials that have a high percentage of light atoms like hydrogen)• These thermal neutrons can then be absorbed or shielded with material having high cross sections for neutron absorptionAbsorption of thermalized neutrons can be done by relatively light materials like polyethylene plastic unlike gamma radiation that require lots of high-z material (lead, concrete, water) to absorb the penetrating gamma.LLNL's Dr. Ralph Moir has pioneered several molten salt fusion reactor concepts (HyLife II and PACER Revisited). A thick liquid falling wall of molten salt loaded with a neutron absorber like 50 micron particles of Boron Carbide as a slurry can absorb damaging fast neutrons. Such a thick falling wall of molten salt can effectively protect fusion chamber structure and largely prevent neutron activation of fusion reactor materials. This permits molten salt ICF fusion reactors to have long 30+ year commercial lifetimes and to at reactor end of life produce little or no neutron activated waste.Slide comparing fission and various fusion reactions from Professor Gerald KulcinskiThere are actually rather good reasons to believe that when nuclear fusion is commercially introduced, it will in short order form the basis of very commercially competitive power plants that will deliver reliable, cheap energy to all in the world that need energy.Fusion’s near term commercial potential -Not all approaches to nuclear fusion will have identical commercial characteristics. Some approaches to nuclear fusion will not in the end be able to produce any actual energy beyond what is required to operate the fusion experiment and as a result will effectively become fusion research dead ends. Other fusion approaches including some that currently receive high levels of funding and international support may ultimately reach break-even energy, but these approaches to fusion may after scaling end up to extraordinarily complex and impractically huge size may end up being uncompetitive with fossil fuel and renewable energy power plants. Such a large experimental fusion physics demonstration may perhaps be built only a single time as a kind of technology proof of principle, but then go no further and never get built in any significant numbers by communities needing cost competitive electrical power.Plasma Density matters when competing to produce cheap energy -Approaches to fusion that routinely use very low density plasma, like tokamaks (ITER) and stellarators (W7-x) will have to be physically larger and contain a much greater volume of fusion plasma than fusion devices that routinely operate on denser plasma. There is literally a 10^11 difference in operating plasma density at fusion conditions between Magnetic Confinement Fusion (MCF) devices like tokamaks and stellarators and Inertial Confinement Fusion (ICF) Experiments like NIF. This is a huge natural competitive advantage to ICF fusion in terms of potential commercial competitiveness.Comparison between the fusion chamber volume of an Inertial Confinement Fusion experiment (NIF) versus a Magnetic Confinement Fusion experiment (ITER) -(notice man in lower right corner for scale)Those who advocate Magnetic Confinement fusion devices will be quick to point out however that ICF fusion currently requires a large stationary football field sized laser fusion driver to ignite the small high plasma density ICF fusion capsules. This is true, but the size and the cost of ICF laser fusion drivers is dropping very rapidly (and the cost of ICF laser fusion drivers are also dropping at a rapid rate) and the impact of the laser fusion driver is destined to be a shrinking contributor to ICF fusion power plant physical size and cost.The power that a pulse laser fusion driver can deliver has increased roughly by a factor of 1000 every decade for the last 40 years. This is in fact a stronger sustained technical advance than even Moore’s law (transistors on a CPU chip).Cost of fusion power generators that can operate using high density fusion plasma -As previously mentioned, the physically smallest and least costly commercial fusion power plants of the future will probably operate using the highest density fusion plasma. Approaches to fusion that cannot operate on a least medium density plasma (10^18 ions/cm^3) will probably not be able to compete, head to head, with fossil fuel or renewable energy power plants.LPP Fusion is currently a private sector small fusion leader in the quest for fusion and is expected to use medium density fusion plasma in their Dense Plasma Focus fusion device. LPP Fusion has produced the following slide as a cost goal for their small modular commercial fusion device.These is a respectably low and impressive cost estimate for small fusion.The Department of Energy EIA's findings suggest that natural gas–fired power plants are cheaper to build with overnight capital costs ranging fromLPP Fusion’s DPF device would be 10X or more cheaper to build and would produce 10X cheaper electricity than the cheapest current form of natural gas power plant.ICF fusion power plants that use the densest fusion plasma have the potential to be the most cost competitive of all small fusion approaches when the technology becomes commercially available.As fusion power plants advance to commercial reality over the next decade, they should improve in power density and decrease in cost.Small Fusion: step by step ferociously, one step at a time.Effort to bring fusion to commercial reality will be rewarded.The investment in fusion technology will be justified and the low cost power that fusion will generate will lift billions of people around the world currently without any access to electricity out of chronic grinding poverty and want.","3,657 followers",Brent Oster,3.6K,357,1.8M,https://www.quora.com/If-we-ever-succeed-in-mastering-nuclear-fusion-will-we-then-have-access-to-infinite-and-very-cheap-energy
1,"I used to work on fusion simulation codes (particle in cell) with the US National Labs when I was at NVIDIA, and I was very interested in seeing if we could solve the problems with fusion and picked the scientist and engineers' brains endlessly.

From having many long conversations with these very intelligent and qualified people I realized that thereI used to work on fusion simulation codes (particle in cell) with the US National Labs when I was at NVIDIA, and I was very interested in seeing if we could solve the problems with fusion and picked the scientist and engineers' brains endlessly. My former father-in-law also worked at Lawrence Berkeley Labs, and was an engineer designing superconducting coil magnets and had decades of experience working with fusion researchers, even though his primary application was particle accelerators. From having many long conversations with these very intelligent and qualified people I realized that there are some really hard problems that block practical fusion, with no immediate solutions in sight.The only place we know of working, large-scale, energy-generating fusion reactions is at the center of a star, where the gravity of the massive star creates the necessary density, temperature, and time being held in that state at the core for fusion reactions to run continuously. This is called the Lawson criteria, and is hard to achieve. All of the layers of the star above that act as an energy exchanger, converting all the gamma rays and fast neutrons at the core into progressively less energetic wavelengths of light and motion of nuclei (heat) so by the time they reach the surface of the star, that energy is emitted as IR and visible light that heats and powers our planet's biosphere, and can provide photovoltaic energy to us as well. All of our efforts in fusion have been to try and reproduce this process on earth, in a small reactor that can provide practical energy.First I will talk aboutThe first problem with magnetic confinement is fundamental - no matter how strong or well formed the magnetic field containing the plasma is, it will always leak, as positive nuclei or ions spiralling around the magnetic field lines collide and scatter, eventually drifting out of the containment field. The only known solution is to make the reactor larger so the scattering ions take longer to travel to the plasma boundary, and thus more fusion can happen during that time. Pretty brute force.The world's most advanced magnetic confinement fusion power plant is ITER, which, to reduce the ion scattering problem mentioned above, is 6-stories tall and about the same dimension in diameter, containing the mass of 3 Eiffel towers, and it is still not expected to be large enough to contain a plasma long enough to sustain burning and produce continuous energy generation.A more practical problem is how do we extract the energy? Most of the energy in deuterium-tritium fusion reactions is released in fast, high-energy neutrons, which (because they are neutral, and have no electric charge) are not confined by the magnetic field, don't heat up the plasma, and have to be stopped by a thick shield, which then heats up, and can vaporize water to steam in order to power turbines and electrical generators. The problem is the constant bombardment by neutrons makes the shield material degrade with time, and become very radioactive, posing a problem for removal and disposal.Also, deuterium-tritium fusion reactions are currently used because they take place at the lowest energies and at the lowest plasma temperatures of all the possible fusion fuels, and thus are easier to ignite and keep lit. However, tritium is not found naturally in any significant quantities and needs to be manufactured in nuclear reactors. With today's production capacity, we just cannot make enough tritium to power even ITER continuously. We could use better fuels, like Helium-3 or Boron-11, which do not emit neutrons and thus 'burn clean', but the plasma temperature must be much higher and the confinement much better to ignite fusion and sustain it with these fuels. And while Boron-11 is plentiful, Helium-3 is so rare that scientists think that the best source of it is lunar regolith that has been irradiated for billions of years on the moon's surface. Any energy generation infrastructure that requires a regular supply of a moon-based fuel, even as energy dense as He3, will probably never work out.A proposed solution to the Tritium deficit is to construct the shield surrounding the reactor with lithium, which is abundant, and fissions into tritium when struck by neutrons, thereby 'breeding' tritium within the reactor itself. Of course, this comes with its own set of problems of how to capture, purify, and contain the tritium after it is released into the tokamak reaction chamber from the walls.Another issue is that when all of the superconducting magnets in ITER are running at full current (160,000 amps) to create the 13 Tesla toroidal magnetic field (13x that in an MRI machine) and to create the other plasma-shaping and heating fields, they are storing 60 GigaJoules, or around 12 Tons of TNT worth of energy. This is because the 180 kilometers of superconducting Niobium-Tin wires in all these massive magnet coils can carry enormous electrical current when supercooled with liquid helium.More info on the ITER magnets:But, if that cooling fails, the superconductor heats up, quenches, and becomes a normal conductor, and can no longer carry that enormous current. With 160,000 amps suddenly meeting resistance, the coil rapidly vaporizes, and causes a meltdown of the other coils, with a total energy release of 12 tons of TNT. This is very undesirable, especially when those coils are wrapped around a highly radioactive shield that also vaporizes and is expelled into the atmosphere. There are fault-detection systems, but it takes a while to dissipate that amount of energy safely, and there may not be enough time to react quickly enough in the event of a catastrophic magnet coil failure.So, some gotchas left to solve for practical fusion energy generation with magnetic confinement, with some perhaps not so easily solved.Inertial confinement fusionIt also has many of the same problems with energy conversion to electricity, and much worse wear and tear on the shielding from these small nuclear fusion explosions being set off, which also trashes all the precision equipment needed to hold the fuel pellet in the focus of the converging laser beams with extreme accuracy. So, a lot of practical damage control problems before inertial confinement fusion is a practical source of energy generation.While these problems may be solved, practical application is still a very long way off, and currently the main application of inertial confinement fusion is as an experimental testbed for calibrating computer codes used to simulate and design thermonuclear fusion weapons. As horrific as these weapons may be, the simulation codes developed for designing them (sorry maintaining them), are the one of the greatest tools for innovation in fusion energy. There is a hydrodynamics code which simulates the behavior of the fissile (and fusion) materials under extreme conditions of pressure and temperature, as well as transport codes that model neutron transport and scattering in the materials under these conditions, and many other bits and bobs. They are all standard numerical techniques, and the really classified part is the integration and calibration of all these codes with previous nuclear weapon tests from the past, and with these small scale simulations in the present.Electrostatic Confinement FusionBasically you need a vacuum container the size of a basketball and a pump to empty it. You put a small spherical wire cage the size of a golf ball in the center, and a larger wire cage the size of a bowling ball around it. You then pump out all the air, and apply a very large (10,000V) electrical potential between the two cages, with the small negative cathode at the center, and the positive anode at the periphery.Then you open a valve and let in a very small amount of Deuterium gas (commercially available) into the vacuum chamber, and it ionizes in the large voltage potential, the D+ ions in the periphery experience a very strong electric field (100K V/m), and are rapidly accelerated towards the center of the reactor, with enough energy to collide and fuse the deuterium nuclei (no tritium required). This fusion can be measured with an external neutron counter.Theoretically, power generation would be simple, as the fusion products consisting of highly energetic He3 and (few) H3 ions could be decelerated in an electric field and the current from that used to generate electricity directly.Here is ECG Herman’s excellent thesis paper on designing and constructing a Farnsworth Fusor:Although they seem like a obvious winners due to their simplicity and effectiveness, ECF reactors have several things limiting scaling:a) There is a limit to the deuterium gas density before performance degrades, so generation capacity is limited.b) Deuterium ions tend to collide with the wire cage cathode in the center, which absorbs them, heating the cage, and causing energy loss and contamination from metal atoms being dislodged.c) As the deuterium ions oscillate back and forth through the center, each time they change direction, they emit bremsstrahlung radiation, or photons of light, losing energy (this is how your dentist’s x-ray machine works).d) Scattering tends to reduce the nice, radial trajectories of the ions into a Maxwellian distribution over time, reducing the fusion that occurs.There has been work in using electromagnets at the periphery to try and hold a ball of electrons in the center, eliminating the need for a central cage… akaThermonuclear WeaponsIn the Teller-Ulam, two-stage, thermonuclear weapon, a spherical plutonium fission primary (with deuterium-tritium fusion fuel at the core to boost it) is imploded by conventional explosives, the plutonium is crushed far beyond critical density, fissions and detonates. The initial radiation released is contained and focused onto the fusion secondary to implode it, ignite fusion, and detonate it. I just mention this to illustrate the enormous energy needed to really reach the Lawson criteria in a large scale, but nuclear weapons kind of freak me out, so I'm going to refer you to the link to the Wikipedia article about them if you want to read more:Thermonuclear weapon - WikipediaSo, in summary, we should not shut down or stop building today's fission nuclear reactors, as commercial fusion reactors are not only far in the future, but also produce radioactive waste (their shielding, which needs to be periodically replaced), and Tokamaks can melt down catastrophically and explode if there is a cooling failure in the magnet coils during full power operation. They also do not run on seawater, like some say. We need expensive and difficult to produce tritium (which is also radioactive) to ignite fusion at the temperatures and densities that today's tokamak magnetic fields can produce.To advance fusion energy in your career, I think the best fields to study would be physics (classical, electrodynamics, plasma, quantum, nuclear…) and computer science, with a focus on numerical simulation. The actual physical fusion reactors are so expensive and time-consuming to build, test, and operate, that you may only get to iterate designs once or twice in a career, but computer simulations can take us in so many different directions more cheaply and easily by comparison.Perhaps there is some exotic stellarator magnetic confinement design, or advanced Farnsworth electrostatic confinement design that has not been explored in depth, that will turn out to hold the key to fusion energy. Simulation is probably the best first step to find it, unless you have a few billion dollars and several hundred kilometers of Niobium-Tin wire and helium cooling tubing to play with.Brent",2 followers,Richard Muller,1.7K,2.3K,201.9M,https://www.quora.com/If-we-ever-succeed-in-mastering-nuclear-fusion-will-we-then-have-access-to-infinite-and-very-cheap-energy

3,"No. The amount of energy “trapped” in a nucleon is a U-shaped curve bottoming out at Iron-56. If you fuse nuclei lighter than this, you can get energy out. If you split nuclei heavier than this, you can get energy out. But to go past the minimum you have to put energy in, not get it out.

5,"It doesn’t, not atom per atom. As other answers to this question point out, a typical fission reaction releases about 200 MeV of energy. (If you don’t know what MeV means, don’t worry about that for now.)A typical fusion reaction releases about 18 MeV. That’s less than 10% of the energy released by fission!However, if you have equal weights of fuel, then the energy released by fusion is greater.

So for equal weights of fuel, fusion releases more energy.Here is a curious fact: in most US thermonuclear weapons, about half of the energy comes from fission! The fusion core emits a large number of fast neutrons, and these neutrons are capable of causing fission in ordinary U-238. So the fusion core in such a bomb is surrounded by U-238, and the induced fission gives about half of the energy. It also gives almost all of the fallout. So in the neutron bomb, this layer is omitted, resulting in much less fallout. The emitted neutrons, which can kill anyone nearby, give the neutron bomb its name.If you are still concerned about what MeV means, it is a unit of energy that is very useful for nuclear reactions. It means “one million eV” where the eV (or “electron volt”) is an energy unit equal to 1.6 x10^-19 joules.",2 followers,Richard Muller,681,2.3K,201.9M,https://www.quora.com/If-we-ever-succeed-in-mastering-nuclear-fusion-will-we-then-have-access-to-infinite-and-very-cheap-energy

Also, scientists need several years of testing the device with normal hydrogen before slowly moving to a deuterium and tritium mix that will achieve full power. It's a relatively slow process, requiring numerous tests to ensure that the device is stable and safe.The next step is a prototype fusion power plant, DEMO, to be built in the 2030s if things go as planned. This device, larger than ITER, will attempt to demonstrate that a stable fusion power plant is feasible. Showing that fusion is economically viable is the next step.A discussion of fusion research would be incomplete without mention of the other viable mechanism for controlled fusion, inertial confinement, which uses multiple lasers fired on a pellet of deuterium and tritium to compress and heat the fuel to the necessary density and temperature for fusion chain reactions. Two facilities employing this method are the National Ignition Facility (NIF) (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Ignition_Facility) and Laser Mégajoule (LMJ) (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LMJ). NIF is operating at LLNL in California, and LMJ will be completed in France in 2012. Inertial confinement is currently much less efficient than magnetic confinement, but a ""fast ignition"" device, HiPER (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HiPER), claims it will produce fusion gains of 72, far surpassing ITER. HiPER is still in the planning phase, and will probably not be complete before 2020.I'll conclude with a few reasons fusion has been so elusive for the past several decades. Numerous plasma instabilities require large and complicated devices to maintain a stable, high-temperature (100 million K) plasma. Furthermore, sudden disruptions in the plasma cause the walls to be bombarded by this hot gas and dust, and it is hard to find materials that can withstand this repeated abuse. Likewise, scientists must learn to prevent these disruptions as they will be even more powerful in larger devices. For inertial confinement, different instabilities require incredibly powerful and symmetric laser pulses to achieve fusion. More powerful, efficient lasers with the ability to fire at about 10 Hz are required for viable power plants. Each confinement method faces a plethora of other problems to be solved, and I don't have the expertise to go into much more detail. Fusion scientists have made great progress, and they continue to make progress on these many challenges.Original answer from August, 2010.

It is an enormous undertaking, on the order of the International Space Station or CERN, but politics and terrible mis-management have continued to plague the progress. A very major change was instituted about 2 years ago, and things have greatly improved since.In any case ITER’s importance cannot be over-stated: there would be no hope for fusion as a potential energy source for mankind without all the research work done worldwide “in support of ITER”. Last month, for example, the 7th (annual) ITER Business Forum was held, with over 1000 (!) delegates attending, from 436 companies and 25 countries. Last October the IAEA (Vienna) organized its 29th FEC - Fusion Energy Conference - in Kyoto (the location changes each time); more than 1400 delegates and over 800 research papers were presented.But fusion energy is much more than ITER. ITER has been the most important catalyst for hundreds of laboratories all over the world, doing work to make fusion happen. In China, in Korea and in Japan are very important world-scale experimental devices, and they will open the path to fusion electricity. In Europe there is very significant activity in almost every country - but especially in the UK, France, Germany and Switzerland. Very unfortunately the US is falling behind, and while the science of fusion has progressed largely due to earlier US activity, and current ideas in the US are at the leading edge, government funding has essentially dried up and private sector funding, while in principle is around, none has been invested in serious fusion technology.Now to your original question: the state of current fusion energy research. In principle there is really only one general method that might prove successful in the medium term, and that is magnetic confinement fusion (MCF) of a deuterium/tritium mixture at very high temperatures. Probably 80–90% of the world’s fusion research is on MCF. Temperatures of 150 million degrees, super-conducting magnets, tritium breeding/storage/isolation, first wall blankets, divertors, plasma facing materials and other aspects of the exciting fusion future - we can do these things!And when it happens - when fusion electricity can be made - imagine a world where the fuel for energy weighs one ten-millionth that of the equivalent of coal, and that fuel comes from seawater! Imagine a world with zero-carbon electricity production (and no other greenhouse gas emissions), with no possible explosion, with virtually no radioactive waste, with no oil pipelines or coal-miners dying on a daily basis.“If all this is true why don’t we have it now?” An excellent question.

My former father-in-law also worked at Lawrence Berkeley Labs, and was an engineer designing superconducting coil magnets and had decades of experience working with fusion researchers, even though his primary application was particle accelerators. From having many long conversations with these very intelligent and qualified people I realized that there are some really hard problems that block practical fusion, with no immediate solutions in sight.The only place we know of working, large-scale, energy-generating fusion reactions is at the center of a star, where the gravity of the massive star creates the necessary density, temperature, and time being held in that state at the core for fusion reactions to run continuously. This is called the Lawson criteria, and is hard to achieve. All of the layers of the star above that act as an energy exchanger, converting all the gamma rays and fast neutrons at the core into progressively less energetic wavelengths of light and motion of nuclei (heat) so by the time they reach the surface of the star, that energy is emitted as IR and visible light that heats and powers our planet's biosphere, and can provide photovoltaic energy to us as well. All of our efforts in fusion have been to try and reproduce this process on earth, in a small reactor that can provide practical energy.First I will talk aboutThe first problem with magnetic confinement is fundamental - no matter how strong or well formed the magnetic field containing the plasma is, it will always leak, as positive nuclei or ions spiralling around the magnetic field lines collide and scatter, eventually drifting out of the containment field. The only known solution is to make the reactor larger so the scattering ions take longer to travel to the plasma boundary, and thus more fusion can happen during that time. Pretty brute force.The world's most advanced magnetic confinement fusion power plant is ITER, which, to reduce the ion scattering problem mentioned above, is 6-stories tall and about the same dimension in diameter, containing the mass of 3 Eiffel towers, and it is still not expected to be large enough to contain a plasma long enough to sustain burning and produce continuous energy generation.A more practical problem is how do we extract the energy? Most of the energy in deuterium-tritium fusion reactions is released in fast, high-energy neutrons, which (because they are neutral, and have no electric charge) are not confined by the magnetic field, don't heat up the plasma, and have to be stopped by a thick shield, which then heats up, and can vaporize water to steam in order to power turbines and electrical generators. The problem is the constant bombardment by neutrons makes the shield material degrade with time, and become very radioactive, posing a problem for removal and disposal.Also, deuterium-tritium fusion reactions are currently used because they take place at the lowest energies and at the lowest plasma temperatures of all the possible fusion fuels, and thus are easier to ignite and keep lit. However, tritium is not found naturally in any significant quantities and needs to be manufactured in nuclear reactors. With today's production capacity, we just cannot make enough tritium to power even ITER continuously. We could use better fuels, like Helium-3 or Boron-11, which do not emit neutrons and thus 'burn clean', but the plasma temperature must be much higher and the confinement much better to ignite fusion and sustain it with these fuels. And while Boron-11 is plentiful, Helium-3 is so rare that scientists think that the best source of it is lunar regolith that has been irradiated for billions of years on the moon's surface. Any energy generation infrastructure that requires a regular supply of a moon-based fuel, even as energy dense as He3, will probably never work out.A proposed solution to the Tritium deficit is to construct the shield surrounding the reactor with lithium, which is abundant, and fissions into tritium when struck by neutrons, thereby 'breeding' tritium within the reactor itself. Of course, this comes with its own set of problems of how to capture, purify, and contain the tritium after it is released into the tokamak reaction chamber from the walls.Another issue is that when all of the superconducting magnets in ITER are running at full current (160,000 amps) to create the 13 Tesla toroidal magnetic field (13x that in an MRI machine) and to create the other plasma-shaping and heating fields, they are storing 60 GigaJoules, or around 12 Tons of TNT worth of energy. This is because the 180 kilometers of superconducting Niobium-Tin wires in all these massive magnet coils can carry enormous electrical current when supercooled with liquid helium.More info on the ITER magnets:But, if that cooling fails, the superconductor heats up, quenches, and becomes a normal conductor, and can no longer carry that enormous current. With 160,000 amps suddenly meeting resistance, the coil rapidly vaporizes, and causes a meltdown of the other coils, with a total energy release of 12 tons of TNT. This is very undesirable, especially when those coils are wrapped around a highly radioactive shield that also vaporizes and is expelled into the atmosphere. There are fault-detection systems, but it takes a while to dissipate that amount of energy safely, and there may not be enough time to react quickly enough in the event of a catastrophic magnet coil failure.So, some gotchas left to solve for practical fusion energy generation with magnetic confinement, with some perhaps not so easily solved.Inertial confinement fusionIt also has many of the same problems with energy conversion to electricity, and much worse wear and tear on the shielding from these small nuclear fusion explosions being set off, which also trashes all the precision equipment needed to hold the fuel pellet in the focus of the converging laser beams with extreme accuracy. So, a lot of practical damage control problems before inertial confinement fusion is a practical source of energy generation.While these problems may be solved, practical application is still a very long way off, and currently the main application of inertial confinement fusion is as an experimental testbed for calibrating computer codes used to simulate and design thermonuclear fusion weapons. As horrific as these weapons may be, the simulation codes developed for designing them (sorry maintaining them), are the one of the greatest tools for innovation in fusion energy. There is a hydrodynamics code which simulates the behavior of the fissile (and fusion) materials under extreme conditions of pressure and temperature, as well as transport codes that model neutron transport and scattering in the materials under these conditions, and many other bits and bobs. They are all standard numerical techniques, and the really classified part is the integration and calibration of all these codes with previous nuclear weapon tests from the past, and with these small scale simulations in the present.Electrostatic Confinement FusionBasically you need a vacuum container the size of a basketball and a pump to empty it. You put a small spherical wire cage the size of a golf ball in the center, and a larger wire cage the size of a bowling ball around it. You then pump out all the air, and apply a very large (10,000V) electrical potential between the two cages, with the small negative cathode at the center, and the positive anode at the periphery.Then you open a valve and let in a very small amount of Deuterium gas (commercially available) into the vacuum chamber, and it ionizes in the large voltage potential, the D+ ions in the periphery experience a very strong electric field (100K V/m), and are rapidly accelerated towards the center of the reactor, with enough energy to collide and fuse the deuterium nuclei (no tritium required). This fusion can be measured with an external neutron counter.Theoretically, power generation would be simple, as the fusion products consisting of highly energetic He3 and (few) H3 ions could be decelerated in an electric field and the current from that used to generate electricity directly.Here is ECG Herman’s excellent thesis paper on designing and constructing a Farnsworth Fusor:Although they seem like a obvious winners due to their simplicity and effectiveness, ECF reactors have several things limiting scaling:a) There is a limit to the deuterium gas density before performance degrades, so generation capacity is limited.b) Deuterium ions tend to collide with the wire cage cathode in the center, which absorbs them, heating the cage, and causing energy loss and contamination from metal atoms being dislodged.c) As the deuterium ions oscillate back and forth through the center, each time they change direction, they emit bremsstrahlung radiation, or photons of light, losing energy (this is how your dentist’s x-ray machine works).d) Scattering tends to reduce the nice, radial trajectories of the ions into a Maxwellian distribution over time, reducing the fusion that occurs.There has been work in using electromagnets at the periphery to try and hold a ball of electrons in the center, eliminating the need for a central cage… akaThermonuclear WeaponsIn the Teller-Ulam, two-stage, thermonuclear weapon, a spherical plutonium fission primary (with deuterium-tritium fusion fuel at the core to boost it) is imploded by conventional explosives, the plutonium is crushed far beyond critical density, fissions and detonates. The initial radiation released is contained and focused onto the fusion secondary to implode it, ignite fusion, and detonate it. I just mention this to illustrate the enormous energy needed to really reach the Lawson criteria in a large scale, but nuclear weapons kind of freak me out, so I'm going to refer you to the link to the Wikipedia article about them if you want to read more:Thermonuclear weapon - WikipediaSo, in summary, we should not shut down or stop building today's fission nuclear reactors, as commercial fusion reactors are not only far in the future, but also produce radioactive waste (their shielding, which needs to be periodically replaced), and Tokamaks can melt down catastrophically and explode if there is a cooling failure in the magnet coils during full power operation. They also do not run on seawater, like some say. We need expensive and difficult to produce tritium (which is also radioactive) to ignite fusion at the temperatures and densities that today's tokamak magnetic fields can produce.To advance fusion energy in your career, I think the best fields to study would be physics (classical, electrodynamics, plasma, quantum, nuclear…) and computer science, with a focus on numerical simulation. The actual physical fusion reactors are so expensive and time-consuming to build, test, and operate, that you may only get to iterate designs once or twice in a career, but computer simulations can take us in so many different directions more cheaply and easily by comparison.Perhaps there is some exotic stellarator magnetic confinement design, or advanced Farnsworth electrostatic confinement design that has not been explored in depth, that will turn out to hold the key to fusion energy. Simulation is probably the best first step to find it, unless you have a few billion dollars and several hundred kilometers of Niobium-Tin wire and helium cooling tubing to play with.Brent",2 followers,Richard Muller,1.7K,2.3K,201.9M,https://www.quora.com/If-we-ever-succeed-in-mastering-nuclear-fusion-will-we-then-have-access-to-infinite-and-very-cheap-energy

A big enough impact to melt all the permafrost and as a result reconstitute the atmosphere would likely make Mars a terrible place to live. Lots of dust. Dust cools the atmosphere and buries rovers. That said, it's possible that big hits in the past have temporarily warmed the planet for a few million years, and xenobiologists find that exciting.Clearly, some subtlety is called for.Mars' surface temperature is stable, which means all this energy falling on the surface is matched by radiation back out into space. In order to increase the surface temperature, one needs to reduce the amount of back radiation. Greenhouse effect! Greenhouse gasses are not my area of expertise, but I'll make some educated guesses anyway.Water vapour and COThis is electrical energy, which is easier to come by than rocket fuel. Nuclear power would be the way to go, but even solar power could take a decent bite out of this. Especially if solar-electrolysis becomes industrialised.Another approach not entirely without merit would be to increase the solar flux by using GIANT mirrors.Another proposed idea is to dig a few dozen enormous holes in the crust to let heat out to the surface.Conclusion:VenusVenus is a MUCH harder bet than Mars. While Mars could be terraformed in only a few thousand years, no gently-gently approach could ever work on Venus.First, alternatives to terraforming. It would be possible to live on Venus in the high atmosphere, in giant floating cities. Using a standard space-station atmospheric mix at about half an earth atmosphere, a pressurized geodesic sphere would float naturally somewhere above the bulk of the clouds of sulfuric acid. Atmospheric motions would likely lead to some rotation about the polar areas, where inhabitants would experience a near-perpetual sunset. Floating cities could be mechanically rotated to provide a day-night cycle for on-board agriculture. The Venusian atmosphere is rich in carbon, oxygen, sulfur, and has trace quantities of water. These could be mined for building materials, while rarer elements could be mined from the surface with long scoops or imported from other places with space-plane shuttles.But Venus is nearly as big as Earth, with similar gravity and heaps of sun. Floating cities are all very well, but we need to house billions of humans, not millions. What's the next step?First, the atmosphere has got to go. 200 atmospheres of crushing pressure, heat, and sulfuric acid rain.Energy required for giant mirror to reflect all light from the surface:After a hundred years or so, the atmosphere freezes out onto the surface (briefly going through an interesting super-critical phase). While you wait, you can use it to absorb the impact of a few icy comets and moons, in order to give Venus some badly needed water.We need a way to spin Venus faster. The obvious approach is to crash asteroids into the surface to make it turn faster. Cost of this isIn fact, the mass of the atmosphere, now frozen out hundreds of meters thick all over the planet, is about the same as the mass of the entire asteroid belt, and it's already on Venus. All you have to do is chuck it off the surface fast enough and in the right direction, and you can spin the planet in any direction you like. In order to spin the planet up to a 24 hour day AND get rid of the frozen atmosphere, it needs to leave the surface at aboutAfter this is done, the energy budget can be pilfered to sculpt a few ocean basins and continents, synthesize a desired atmosphere, open the sunshade a little, and start growing plants.Conclusion:Postscript:Slate article comments:Magnetic fields!",0 followers,Hiroyuki Kitagawa,7K,2.5K,4.7M,https://www.quora.com/If-we-ever-succeed-in-mastering-nuclear-fusion-will-we-then-have-access-to-infinite-and-very-cheap-energy

15,"Fusion is the area where direct fusion to electrical energy conversion systems have been more thoroughly studied.Unlike nuclear fission where 98% of the energy released from fission is released as heat, fusion reactions release the majority of their energy in a wider variety of ways.Efficient conversion of fusion energy into electrical energy is more challenging and complex than in the case of converting fission nuclear energy where about 98% of energy released from nuclear fission is released as heat.In DT fusion, the fusion reaction most likely to first be harnessed to produce controlled relFusion is the area where direct fusion to electrical energy conversion systems have been more thoroughly studied.Unlike nuclear fission where 98% of the energy released from fission is released as heat, fusion reactions release the majority of their energy in a wider variety of ways.Efficient conversion of fusion energy into electrical energy is more challenging and complex than in the case of converting fission nuclear energy where about 98% of energy released from nuclear fission is released as heat.In DT fusion, the fusion reaction most likely to first be harnessed to produce controlled release of fusion energy, 80% of the energy released goes into 14MeV neutrons and only the remaining 20% of energy released as alpha particles which can be readily absorbed in some medium to become heat.D-D fusion of deuterium separated from sea water is not a fusion reaction that is considered to be practical in Magnetic Confinement Fusion devices intended to produce fusion with energy gain (more power from the fusion reactor than it takes to operate the fusion reactor). This is because D-D fusion reaction rates in MCF fusion devices we know how to build are too low to result in break-even energy with D-D fusion. The situation is different however with Inertial Confinement Fusion. Commercially significant D-D fusion in Inertial Confinement Fusion reactors using pure deuterium fuel separated from sea water is practical but energy conversion in this case is unfortunately somewhat complex, with about 66% of the energy release from D-D fusion being released as energetic neutrons.D-D Fusion of Deuterium fuel produces energy through four reactions:D + D -> He-3 + n + 3.268 MeVD + D -> T + p + 4.03 MeV(side chains)D + T -> He-4 + n + 17.588 MeVHe-3 + D -> He-4 + p + 18.34 MeVThe net effect of these four fusion reactions taken together is:6 D -> 2 He-4 + 2p + 2n + 43.243 MeVWhile 66% of the energy of D-D fusion is released in fusion neutrons, a significant amount of energy is also released in charged protons and alpha particles.Unlike the charged particles, the uncharged neutrons cannot be confined by a magnetic field, and for this reason cannot be easily used for a direct conversion into electric energy.Some first generation fusion power plant concepts have featured early power conversion designs that primarily use fusion heat to produce electricity and use the larger 80% fraction of fusion energy found in energetic neutrons to breed Tritium in a breeding blanket loaded with Lithium-6.It is possible to propose energy conversion systems for D-D fusion power plants that attempt to capture some of the energy released by D-D fusion fast neutrons and turn that energy into heat. For such a system, the neutrons have to be slowed down in some medium (like molten lithium), heating this medium to a temperature of less than 10^3K. The heat collected in the lithium blanket is then removed from this medium and is used to drive a turbine-generator. This conversion of nuclear into electric energy unfortunately has a Carnot efficiency of about 30%.Using a lithium blanket to capture a portion of the energy in fusion neutrons, which is 80% of the energy released from DT fusion and 66% of the energy released from D-D fusion , the energy conversion efficiency is low - no more than 24% over all. Further, liquid lithium metal is very flammable at temperature likely to exist in operating first generation fusion reactors. Use of hot molten lithium metal as a neutron absorber - coolant could compromise the intrinsic safety of first generation fusion reactors. We should be trying to engineer the safest commercial fusion reactors we know how to design. I believe it would be better to consider using a safer coolant such as molten salts in first generation fusion reactors. Molten salts cannot spontaneously burst into flame when coming into contact with air or water in a large accident while compromising overall fusion reactor safety.While this relatively low 24% conversion efficiency of fusion energy into electrical energy cannot be overcome in magnetic confinement reactors we currently know how to build,ICF fusion power plants (both DT and DD) can be accomplished higher energy conversion efficiency by surrounding the inertial confinement fusion target with a sufficiently thick layer of liquid hydrogen and a thin outer layer of boron, creating a hot plasma fire ball. The hydrogen layer must be chosen just thick and dense enough to be heated by the neutrons to 100,000 degrees K. The so generated, fully ionized, and rapidly expanding hydrogen fire ball can then drive a pulsed magnetohydrodynamic generator at an almost 100% Carnot efficiency [1].Electrostatic direct conversion -More advanced fusion reactions like p-B11 and He3-He3 that released a larger proportion of fusion energy as charged particles (protons and alpha particles) can use direct collection of charged particles working against magnetic or electrostatic field or directly collect particles on stationary screens to convert fusion energy charged particles into electrical energy at high efficiency[2].Electrostatic direct conversion uses a charged particles’ motion to make a voltage. This voltage drives electricity in a wire. This becomes the electrical power. It is normally thought of in reverse. Ordinarily, a voltage puts a particle in motion. Direct conversion does the opposite. It uses a particle's motion to produce a voltage. It has been described as a linear accelerator running backwards. An early supporter of this method was Richard F. Post at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. He proposed a way to capture the kinetic energy of charged particles as they were exhausted from a fusion reactor and convert this into voltage, which would drive current in a wire. Dr. Post helped developed the theoretical underpinnings of direct conversion, which was later demonstrated by Dr. William Barr and Dr.Ralph Moir at LLNL. They demonstrated a 48 percent energy capture efficiency on the Tandem Mirror Experiment in 1981. In subsequent decades, the efficiency of converting the energy in charged particles as are produced in advanced fusion reactions into electricity was demonstrated at efficiencies as high as 80%, which is about twice as high an efficiency as the best current thermal power plant turbine generators can demonstrate while converting heat into electricity.[1] -",825 followers,George Dowson,4K,527,3.7M,https://www.quora.com/If-we-ever-succeed-in-mastering-nuclear-fusion-will-we-then-have-access-to-infinite-and-very-cheap-energy

20,"The problem that needed to be resolved with fission was the runaway chain reaction problem. That means that once fission started, it created the conditions to cause fission in adjacent atoms. They solved this using the nuclear moderators, such as heavy water and carbon.

Once these were solved, it became a baking recipe type of problem, just follow the same recipe over and over again and you will always get the same results out.The problem with fusion is that the fuel actively tries to avoid getting into chain reaction situations. It’s far easier not to get into a chain reaction than to get into a chain reaction, since the nuclear fuel of fusion naturally repels each other. So they have to put in a tremendous amount of energy to get these atoms into a fusion chain reaction process. In the case of fusion bombs, they actually initiate the fusion reaction with a fission reaction of uranium or other fissile material. So you get two nuclear reactions for the price of one, a fission one is the primer, and the fusion one is the secondary and larger energy source. In controlled fusion, you can’t just set off a fission bomb to set off a fusion bomb, because you really don’t want a bomb at all as your basic goal. So it’s very difficult to control and throttle the fusion reaction.",2 followers,Richard Muller,1.7K,2.3K,201.9M,https://www.quora.com/If-we-ever-succeed-in-mastering-nuclear-fusion-will-we-then-have-access-to-infinite-and-very-cheap-energy
