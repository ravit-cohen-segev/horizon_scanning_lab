Because it can build it’s rockets with 320 times less money than NASA!! OMG!! Amazing!!Yeah well…kinda.Altough this is an amazing achievment it’s not really revolutionizing space travels by means of engineering, there’s no huge improvement in motors or technology really…you know why??Because SpaceX doesn’t take care of R&D, they just use NASA’s patents, that why they can build cheaper spacecraft’s, all the costy work is done.If you read carefully through is biography you can see that Elon is focused,determined, good willed ( but he can be the biggest jackass in the face of the planet), and smart, but he’s not even close to a genius, he’s more of a businessman than engineer.He uses the same materials everyone does, he just get’s them cheaper, he doesn’t bring any technical advancements to the table, he get’s really smart people to do the hard brainy work, so he doesn’t have to.So yeah, the guy’s smart, but most of it is just what the media wants to portray, and some people just eat it up.","8,614 followers",Abdullah Shiryar,9.2K,182,7.5M,https://www.quora.com/Is-crypto-mining-at-home-a-more-profitable-solution-than-buying-directly-cryptocurrencies

Things always have, haven’t they? For crying out loud, you’re Elon Musk!Right now, Elon Musk is being pulled in a million different directions. The man has started over half a dozen tech companies, and has dipped his hands in countless more.I’m a skeptic of Musk and those who herald him as a “genius”. He’s not going to make it to Mars by 2024 (NASA will probably have beaten him by the time he does), his “Hyperloop” won’t be capable of the initially proposed 1,000 mph travel (if it’s ever built), and his attempts to conceive AI will be infertile until we master quantum processing (and, as Richard Feynman once put it, ""if you think you understand quantum mechanics, you don't understand quantum mechanics”). Musk is a trailblazing businessman, not some super-scientist.That said, there’s no denying Musk’s footprint on the world. He’s inspired countless people, and his successful ventures have benefited countless more. In the coming century I expect him to be remembered as a critical stepping stone toward scientific progress, in the vein of Jobs, Tesla, or Edison. I’ll admit he’s made a recent string of mistakes (this article from the New York Times should bring the unaware up to speed:From what I’ve gleaned, Musk is a man who’ll settle for nothing less than the actualization of his vision for the world.

Any answer I might give will be completely colored by my own experiences, so full disclaimer this is not an unbiased piece free of personal narrative.It is said that you cannot dream yourself a character; you must hammer and forge one yourself. If any leader and any company has done that, and continues to do that it is SpaceX. To try and capture in words what working with Elon is like, I’d like to share some specific memories, particularly of one really rough day and its epic aftermath.On Aug 2 2008, 8 months after I joined the company, SpaceX launched its third flight of the Falcon 1 launch vehicle. Falcon 1 was the predecessor to the Falcon 9 launch vehicles that the company flies today.It was a defining moment for the company. Elon had a couple years prior stated in the press that his $100M personal investment in the company would get us up to 3 tries and if we couldn’t be successful by the third flight we may have to admit defeat. In addition to the pressure created by this narrative in the press, the lobbyist armies of our competitors (largest, most powerful defense contractors in the world) had been in overdrive in DC trying to undermine SpaceX and damage our credibility by painting us as too risky and inexperienced in order to protect their multi-billion dollar interests in the space launch business.However, shortly after the first stage flight, immediately following stage separation (when the first stage of the vehicle detaches and falls away from the 2nd stage of the vehicle which continues its journey to space) we lost the vehicle and mission.SpaceX, VP of Propulsion Tom Mueller, the modern day godfather of rocket science and one of the most brilliant scientific minds on the planet, and his team had done such a great job redesigning the vehicles engines systems that they were even more efficient and powerful than in some ways projected.We turned off the first stage engine, and then proceeded to separate the vehicle stages; however when the stages uncoupled there was still a little leftover ‘kick’ or thrust in the first stage engine- so our first stage literally rear ended our second stage immediately after we had tried to separate the two sections of the vehicle. It was a devastating emotional experience.I stood around with the then 350 or so employees, and we cheered the vehicle on as it took off, and as we were watching the mission clock and knew that the stages were about to separate - the video feed was cut. The company is on a 20 second viewing delay from the mission control team as we are being projected the external press feed which is delayed in case of major mission anomalies. So when we lost video, we knew something had gone wrong in a big way.Elon and about 7-8 of the most senior technical people at SpaceX were commanding the mission from a trailer in the back of the Hawthorne factory; and we all waited anxiously for the trailer door to open and for someone to tell us something. The mood in the building hung thick with despair; you have to keep in mind that by this point SpaceX was 6 years old, and many people have been working 70-80+ hours a week, swimming against extremely powerful currents, like difficult barriers in technology, institution, politics, and finance- by sheer force of their blood and sweat.They had all given so much, were mentally and physically exhausted, and really needed a win in order to replenish their spiritual wells and give them the faith to keep following this man up a treacherous mountain that had depleted the hopes and resources of the many others who had come to conquer it.This night would forever impact the future of the company, it had the potential to send the company into a downward spiral, from which we may not have ever recovered. A failure in leadership would have destroyed us not only from the eyes of the press or potential consumers but it would have destroyed us internally.When Elon came out he walked past the press and first addressed the company. Although his exact words escape me in how he started off, the essence of his comments were that:I think most of us would have followed him into the gates of hell carrying suntan oil after that. It was the most impressive display of leadership that I have ever witnessed. Within moments the energy of the building went from despair and defeat to a massive buzz of determination as people began to focus on moving forward instead of looking back. This shift happened collectively, across all 300+ people in a matter of not more than 5 seconds. I wish I had video footage as I would love to analyze the shifts in body language that occurred over those 5 seconds. It was an unbelievably powerful experience.What happened in the days and weeks following that night is nothing short of a series of miracles:So for those who ask the question, this is in my opinion the true character of Elon Musk. Undeterred in the face of all odds, undaunted by the fear of failure, and forged in the battlefields of some of the most terrifyingly technical, and capital intensive challenges that any human being could choose to take on. Somehow he comes out alive, every time - with the other guy's head on a platter.Working with him isn’t a comfortable experience, he is never satisfied with himself so he is never really satisfied with anyone around him. He pushes himself harder and harder and he pushes others around him the exact same way. The challenge is that he is a machine and the rest of us aren’t. So if you work for Elon you have to accept the discomfort. But in that discomfort is the kind of growth you can’t get anywhere else, and worth every ounce of blood and sweat.","5,929 followers",Alex Lightman,1.1K,752,6.9M,https://www.quora.com/Will-Elon-Musk-ever-think-about-other-options-in-green-energy-solutions-other-than-solar

Think about what people will want in future. We all know right now EVs renewable energy is the future but we still are not investing in it. It doesn't matter if you buy 1stock or 10. What's important is that you're thinking, what can actually happen in future and then selecting those particular stocks. It doesn't matter if you're wrong or right just keep your stock selection that way and work in small quantity if it's a penny stock.P.s.2- I will still suggest to avoid penny stocks. Go with the market leaders when they are available at lower prices. You can easily get 20–40% returns in a year which is more than enough. Don't be greedy, good things take time.
