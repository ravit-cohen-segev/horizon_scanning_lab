0,"GPUs should last a long time, even when mining 24/7. Unless they let the heat get over 85 C ish then they’re not doing any real damage to the GPU. The fans should be the first thing to wear out under normal mining.I mine with all my GPUs. I game on the same GPUs. Over almost a year now, my GPUs are not slowing down at the gaming benchmark at all. I usually keep the fans high enough that the GPUs don’t get over 80 C though, so I’m taking good care of my gear.So no it’s not always bad to buy a mining GPU. If you bought a card off of me, you’ll get one that will outlive its usefulness.However, soGPUs should last a long time, even when mining 24/7.

If you bought a card off of me, you’ll get one that will outlive its usefulness.However, some people out there really just have the mentality to overclock and let the heat get bad and let them burn out just to make more coin faster. Obviously you can’t buy from those people, as there are some people out there who run cards hot, burn them out, then try and sell them.An honest person would be selling a GPU because it’s not profitable for mining anymore, not because they burned it out. If you buy a GPU from those people, then you’ll get plenty of life out of it.",2 followers,Kelly Pearson,1K,0,0,https://www.quora.com/Should-I-by-cryptocurrency-mining-hardware-now-that-the-price-of-graphics-cards-is-low
1,"You should invest in $APT, the native token of APTOS for long term.My reason is that Aptos is aiming to build a more scalable blockchain with faster transactions and lower fees, as well as more reliable and predictable for large clients to be interested in embracing the blockchain. With what they aim to achieve I believe investing in $APT on MEXC for the long term would be a wise decision.","1,716 followers",Wilfred Edmund,567,65,879.6K,https://www.quora.com/Should-I-by-cryptocurrency-mining-hardware-now-that-the-price-of-graphics-cards-is-low

In my opinion, these are the most interesting coins to hold for the long term:DIVIDIVI had one of the best performances in 2021 when it went from 0.03 cents to an all-time high of 0.19 cents and in September 2022 it already experienced a rise of +100%, going from 0.010 cents to 0.029 cents, so experienced analysts project that it can reach a value of +$2 at the end of 2022 and up to +$5 by the end of summer 2023, and from there to the moon! Divi also just updated its roadmap, undoubtedly it's one of the most promising altcoins out there today.Also, DiviWallet 2.0 has made a big impact due to the multiple functions it has. In addition, DIVI offers participation and is a leader in innovation with its 5 levels of masternodes that allow people of different income levels to have one, not only producing large amounts but valuable rewards that have a high ROR. It also has various use cases plus gift cards and its FinTech, which produce the demand for the coin and this is what will help the coin gain value. With its low transaction fees, this coin is great for everyday payments, so this bear market is the perfect opportunity to get your hands on some new coins. Divi in ​​2022 made two associations, one with #LaLiga and the other with TPT Global Tech means that we can expect a lot of growth and adoption very soon.It is undoubtedly one of the most promising altcoins out there today and has a very educationalCARDANOBITCOINPOLKADOTThese next few years will be key for cryptocurrencies to convince and position themselves as indispensable currencies, we will see what happens in the end.

Like this one:Crypto exchange BitMEX, a perfect Pick-and-Shovel play; Source: SCMPNo one actually knows how long this whole crypto thing will last but instead of losing sleep at night constantly checking token prices which have zero fundamentals behind them, I’d much rather invest in a real business that will make money whether Bitcoin prices go up or down. (Full disclosure: To satisfy my own curiosity, I doFor any significant investment in the space, I’m using the pick-and-shovel strategy to gain crypto exposure in the portfolio. Which “play” am I investing in? After much research and networking and grovelling, I’ve finally found a very good target which is ironically, a mining operation. I’ve been looking for an exchange play but haven’t found one yet…(so if any of you know of a solid one looking for funding, feel free to lob it my way :-))Now when I see tweets flash through my feed from pundits that claim Bitcoin will be worth US$100,000 per coin in roughly 3-5 years time but not without seeing US$1500 first at some point along the way...I’m not fussed. I (figuratively) sleep well at night knowing that I’m making money regardless of market direction.(BTW, don’t you love the price predictions on Bitcoin that pundits come up with from time to time? Talk about a wide price and time spread. And they are always disclaimed with something like “these predictions should be taken with a grain of salt” and “do your own research” and “this is no way constitutes investment advice”. Imagine if there was a “sell side analyst” job in crypto.

6,"The short answer is, buyers and sellers. All they buy or sell, directly affects the Bitcoin/Etherum and all other crypto currency prices. But you should understand it in detail.A cryptocurrency is usually not governed or backed by a central authority. With government backing, consumers will be more confident in the value of a currency, and they will be able to spend in the currency and collect it.The following factors directly affect the prices of crypto go up and down.Cryptocurrency supply and demandSupply and demand determine the value of any item.

But you should understand it in detail.A cryptocurrency is usually not governed or backed by a central authority. With government backing, consumers will be more confident in the value of a currency, and they will be able to spend in the currency and collect it.The following factors directly affect the prices of crypto go up and down.Cryptocurrency supply and demandSupply and demand determine the value of any item. The price will rise if demand is greater than supply. Cryptocurrencies always have a known supply. Some, such as Bitcoin, have a fixed maximum supply. Other cryptocurrencies, like Ether (CRYPTO:ETH*), have no supply limit. To prevent the circulating supply from becoming too large and slowing inflation, some cryptocurrencies ""burn"" existing tokens. Burning a token means sending them to an unrecoverable address on the blockchain.Cost of productionCryptocurrency tokens are created through a process called mining. Computers are used to verify the next block on the blockchain in cryptocurrency mining. It is cryptocurrency's decentralized network of miners that makes it work. The protocol generates tokens in exchange for the fees paid by the exchange parties to the miners, as well as cryptocurrency tokens as a reward.CompetitionThe number of different cryptocurrency projects and tokens keeps growing every day. While creating a viable cryptocurrency requires a network of users, there is a relatively low barrier to entry for new competitors.Internal governanceIn cryptocurrency networks, there is rarely a fixed set of rules to follow. Programmers adapt their projects based on community feedback. Some tokens, called governance tokens, give holders the ability to have a say in how tokens are mined and used. To make any changes in the governance of a token's governance, all stakeholders must agree.Regulations and legal requirementsThere is some confusion over who should regulate cryptocurrency exchanges. While the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), considers cryptocurrencies securities, like bonds and stocks, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission(CFTC) believes they are commodities like coffee and gold.They can't claim any regulatory authority over cryptocurrency exchanges. A ruling could clarify and increase cryptocurrency value, while also opening up the possibility of more crypto-related financial products being traded.Finding value in cryptocurrencyYou can make better decisions about cryptocurrency investments if you are able to understand the supply-demand principle behind cryptocurrency's value, as well as the factors that influence them. You could consider cryptocurrency a good investment if you believe that demand will rise for reasons X,Y, and Z, but don't think that supply will keep pace.If you don’t know how to get the edge of all this process then I will suggest you try an automated crypto trading bot.
