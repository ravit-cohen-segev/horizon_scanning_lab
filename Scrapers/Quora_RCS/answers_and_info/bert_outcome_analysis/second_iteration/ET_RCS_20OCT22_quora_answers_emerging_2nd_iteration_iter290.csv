In nuclear power plants this is done by using control rods made of neutron absorbing materials like cadmium or boronFusion:since the reaction requires extremely high temperature and pressure which exists in stars, so fusion reactions happen in stars only.However, in recent times there have been many attempts to create conditions for fusion reaction and harness the energy obtained from it. But scientists haven’t achieved a net gain of energy.Fusion reactors generally use hydrogen isotopes such as deuterium and tritium, which react more easily and create a confined plasma of millions of degrees using lasers or magnetic methods. The major challenges in realising fusion power are to engineer a system that can confine the plasma long enough at high enough temperature. For that scientists keep the plasma in a very high magnetic field such that plasma begins to float inside the chamber, without touching its surface.Then water tubes on the outer surface of chamber absorb the heat and gets energised this water is then ejected on a turbine to create electricity.I hope my answer helped you.","220,149 followers",Franklin Veaux,3.1K,47.3K,779.4M,https://www.quora.com/Can-nuclear-fission-or-fusion-be-controlled
2,"I agree with the other answers, but want to add that neither is “well-controlled”. Both have chaotic results, so we only get heat, and cannot do direct generation of electricity from either fission or fusion. Perhaps this is expecting too much, or perhaps the achievement of direct conversion and a stream-flow process is an important 'someday' goal. It's not really in sight, yet. Hydropower, in contrast, is an example of something well-controlled.","220,149 followers",Franklin Veaux,1.6K,47.3K,779.4M,https://www.quora.com/Can-nuclear-fission-or-fusion-be-controlled
3,"I used to work on fusion simulation codes (particle in cell) with the US National Labs when I was at NVIDIA, and I was very interested in seeing if we could solve the problems with fusion and picked the scientist and engineers' brains endlessly. My former father-in-law also worked at Lawrence Berkeley Labs, and was an engineer designing superconducting coil magnets and had decades of experience working with fusion researchers, even though his primary application was particle accelerators. From having many long conversations with these very intelligent and qualified people I realized that thereI used to work on fusion simulation codes (particle in cell) with the US National Labs when I was at NVIDIA, and I was very interested in seeing if we could solve the problems with fusion and picked the scientist and engineers' brains endlessly. My former father-in-law also worked at Lawrence Berkeley Labs, and was an engineer designing superconducting coil magnets and had decades of experience working with fusion researchers, even though his primary application was particle accelerators. From having many long conversations with these very intelligent and qualified people I realized that there are some really hard problems that block practical fusion, with no immediate solutions in sight.The only place we know of working, large-scale, energy-generating fusion reactions is at the center of a star, where the gravity of the massive star creates the necessary density, temperature, and time being held in that state at the core for fusion reactions to run continuously. This is called the Lawson criteria, and is hard to achieve. All of the layers of the star above that act as an energy exchanger, converting all the gamma rays and fast neutrons at the core into progressively less energetic wavelengths of light and motion of nuclei (heat) so by the time they reach the surface of the star, that energy is emitted as IR and visible light that heats and powers our planet's biosphere, and can provide photovoltaic energy to us as well. All of our efforts in fusion have been to try and reproduce this process on earth, in a small reactor that can provide practical energy.First I will talk aboutThe first problem with magnetic confinement is fundamental - no matter how strong or well formed the magnetic field containing the plasma is, it will always leak, as positive nuclei or ions spiralling around the magnetic field lines collide and scatter, eventually drifting out of the containment field. The only known solution is to make the reactor larger so the scattering ions take longer to travel to the plasma boundary, and thus more fusion can happen during that time. Pretty brute force.The world's most advanced magnetic confinement fusion power plant is ITER, which, to reduce the ion scattering problem mentioned above, is 6-stories tall and about the same dimension in diameter, containing the mass of 3 Eiffel towers, and it is still not expected to be large enough to contain a plasma long enough to sustain burning and produce continuous energy generation.A more practical problem is how do we extract the energy? Most of the energy in deuterium-tritium fusion reactions is released in fast, high-energy neutrons, which (because they are neutral, and have no electric charge) are not confined by the magnetic field, don't heat up the plasma, and have to be stopped by a thick shield, which then heats up, and can vaporize water to steam in order to power turbines and electrical generators. The problem is the constant bombardment by neutrons makes the shield material degrade with time, and become very radioactive, posing a problem for removal and disposal.Also, deuterium-tritium fusion reactions are currently used because they take place at the lowest energies and at the lowest plasma temperatures of all the possible fusion fuels, and thus are easier to ignite and keep lit. However, tritium is not found naturally in any significant quantities and needs to be manufactured in nuclear reactors. With today's production capacity, we just cannot make enough tritium to power even ITER continuously. We could use better fuels, like Helium-3 or Boron-11, which do not emit neutrons and thus 'burn clean', but the plasma temperature must be much higher and the confinement much better to ignite fusion and sustain it with these fuels. And while Boron-11 is plentiful, Helium-3 is so rare that scientists think that the best source of it is lunar regolith that has been irradiated for billions of years on the moon's surface. Any energy generation infrastructure that requires a regular supply of a moon-based fuel, even as energy dense as He3, will probably never work out.A proposed solution to the Tritium deficit is to construct the shield surrounding the reactor with lithium, which is abundant, and fissions into tritium when struck by neutrons, thereby 'breeding' tritium within the reactor itself. Of course, this comes with its own set of problems of how to capture, purify, and contain the tritium after it is released into the tokamak reaction chamber from the walls.Another issue is that when all of the superconducting magnets in ITER are running at full current (160,000 amps) to create the 13 Tesla toroidal magnetic field (13x that in an MRI machine) and to create the other plasma-shaping and heating fields, they are storing 60 GigaJoules, or around 12 Tons of TNT worth of energy. This is because the 180 kilometers of superconducting Niobium-Tin wires in all these massive magnet coils can carry enormous electrical current when supercooled with liquid helium.More info on the ITER magnets:But, if that cooling fails, the superconductor heats up, quenches, and becomes a normal conductor, and can no longer carry that enormous current. With 160,000 amps suddenly meeting resistance, the coil rapidly vaporizes, and causes a meltdown of the other coils, with a total energy release of 12 tons of TNT. This is very undesirable, especially when those coils are wrapped around a highly radioactive shield that also vaporizes and is expelled into the atmosphere. There are fault-detection systems, but it takes a while to dissipate that amount of energy safely, and there may not be enough time to react quickly enough in the event of a catastrophic magnet coil failure.So, some gotchas left to solve for practical fusion energy generation with magnetic confinement, with some perhaps not so easily solved.Inertial confinement fusionIt also has many of the same problems with energy conversion to electricity, and much worse wear and tear on the shielding from these small nuclear fusion explosions being set off, which also trashes all the precision equipment needed to hold the fuel pellet in the focus of the converging laser beams with extreme accuracy. So, a lot of practical damage control problems before inertial confinement fusion is a practical source of energy generation.While these problems may be solved, practical application is still a very long way off, and currently the main application of inertial confinement fusion is as an experimental testbed for calibrating computer codes used to simulate and design thermonuclear fusion weapons. As horrific as these weapons may be, the simulation codes developed for designing them (sorry maintaining them), are the one of the greatest tools for innovation in fusion energy. There is a hydrodynamics code which simulates the behavior of the fissile (and fusion) materials under extreme conditions of pressure and temperature, as well as transport codes that model neutron transport and scattering in the materials under these conditions, and many other bits and bobs. They are all standard numerical techniques, and the really classified part is the integration and calibration of all these codes with previous nuclear weapon tests from the past, and with these small scale simulations in the present.Electrostatic Confinement FusionBasically you need a vacuum container the size of a basketball and a pump to empty it. You put a small spherical wire cage the size of a golf ball in the center, and a larger wire cage the size of a bowling ball around it. You then pump out all the air, and apply a very large (10,000V) electrical potential between the two cages, with the small negative cathode at the center, and the positive anode at the periphery.Then you open a valve and let in a very small amount of Deuterium gas (commercially available) into the vacuum chamber, and it ionizes in the large voltage potential, the D+ ions in the periphery experience a very strong electric field (100K V/m), and are rapidly accelerated towards the center of the reactor, with enough energy to collide and fuse the deuterium nuclei (no tritium required). This fusion can be measured with an external neutron counter.Theoretically, power generation would be simple, as the fusion products consisting of highly energetic He3 and (few) H3 ions could be decelerated in an electric field and the current from that used to generate electricity directly.Here is ECG Herman’s excellent thesis paper on designing and constructing a Farnsworth Fusor:Although they seem like a obvious winners due to their simplicity and effectiveness, ECF reactors have several things limiting scaling:a) There is a limit to the deuterium gas density before performance degrades, so generation capacity is limited.b) Deuterium ions tend to collide with the wire cage cathode in the center, which absorbs them, heating the cage, and causing energy loss and contamination from metal atoms being dislodged.c) As the deuterium ions oscillate back and forth through the center, each time they change direction, they emit bremsstrahlung radiation, or photons of light, losing energy (this is how your dentist’s x-ray machine works).d) Scattering tends to reduce the nice, radial trajectories of the ions into a Maxwellian distribution over time, reducing the fusion that occurs.There has been work in using electromagnets at the periphery to try and hold a ball of electrons in the center, eliminating the need for a central cage… akaThermonuclear WeaponsIn the Teller-Ulam, two-stage, thermonuclear weapon, a spherical plutonium fission primary (with deuterium-tritium fusion fuel at the core to boost it) is imploded by conventional explosives, the plutonium is crushed far beyond critical density, fissions and detonates. The initial radiation released is contained and focused onto the fusion secondary to implode it, ignite fusion, and detonate it. I just mention this to illustrate the enormous energy needed to really reach the Lawson criteria in a large scale, but nuclear weapons kind of freak me out, so I'm going to refer you to the link to the Wikipedia article about them if you want to read more:Thermonuclear weapon - WikipediaSo, in summary, we should not shut down or stop building today's fission nuclear reactors, as commercial fusion reactors are not only far in the future, but also produce radioactive waste (their shielding, which needs to be periodically replaced), and Tokamaks can melt down catastrophically and explode if there is a cooling failure in the magnet coils during full power operation. They also do not run on seawater, like some say. We need expensive and difficult to produce tritium (which is also radioactive) to ignite fusion at the temperatures and densities that today's tokamak magnetic fields can produce.To advance fusion energy in your career, I think the best fields to study would be physics (classical, electrodynamics, plasma, quantum, nuclear…) and computer science, with a focus on numerical simulation. The actual physical fusion reactors are so expensive and time-consuming to build, test, and operate, that you may only get to iterate designs once or twice in a career, but computer simulations can take us in so many different directions more cheaply and easily by comparison.Perhaps there is some exotic stellarator magnetic confinement design, or advanced Farnsworth electrostatic confinement design that has not been explored in depth, that will turn out to hold the key to fusion energy. Simulation is probably the best first step to find it, unless you have a few billion dollars and several hundred kilometers of Niobium-Tin wire and helium cooling tubing to play with.Brent",2 followers,Richard Muller,1.7K,2.3K,201.9M,https://www.quora.com/Can-nuclear-fission-or-fusion-be-controlled

This was a real contest at the time, and both technologies were tried and each had some commercial success. At the time, some early auto customers might have been skeptical that a vehicle powered by thousands of small explosions inside the confined volume of an engine block would be safe and there was doubt that an engine based on producing thousands of carefully timed explosions would be reliable and hang together and be practical in the long run. Over time, the public came to feel that internal combustion engines, even though they depend on thousands of small explosions, can still be practical and safe, and the Stanley Steamer, and other model continuous burning steam powered vehicles, were abandoned as not as efficient.In the next couple of decades we may see a revisiting of the debate over smooth burning Diffuse Plasma Magnetic Confinement Fusion versus Inertial Confinement Fusion featuring a succession small controlled fusion bursts of between 100 - 250 GJ per shot. It is a harder job to keep reliable containment of a plasma at fusion conditions on a magnetic confinement device like a large tokamak that does a continuous plasma burn - the containment tends to fail and the reactor has to periodically be restarted. ICF fusion has already been demonstrated to reliably produce energy on demand (in fission ignited fusion - first-time every-time).Accumulated experience suggests that the public is more comfortable with fusion power proposals that promise to produce fusion energy smoothly, in a continuous burn. Fusion technologies like ICF that reliably produce fusion in a succession of short controlled bursts are not as comfortable a concept (and tend to not get funded, even if they are in fact just as safe and are far more practical).During the cold war, the military was only interested in fusion devices that produced military relevant energy yields and blast effects. Big was good and was what the military requested of Lab weapons developers. Nuclear designers at LLNL and LANL were for the most part not funded to do sustained development of smaller fission-fusion and pure fusion devices intended for ultra-clean ICF power generation. Commercial ICF fusion would greatly benefit from the development of much smaller pure fusion devices. Devices producing a reliable fusion yield of about 250 GJ per shot, which is about 16X smaller in energy yield than the smallest thermonuclear device ever retained in the US nuclear arsenal.The military did not have interest in developing small ultra-clean devices specifically engineered for fusion power generation, so Lab nuclear designers never went very far in that direction. It can now be revealed that there was a well funded and well led effort to produce a tactical pure fusion device for the military that did not require a fission primary and as a result, would produce virtually no radioactive fallout. Such a device could be used in a military emergency as a “last stand” defense on friendly home soil against an overwhelmingly strong conventional tank-infantry assault.DOE published in 2001 the following document -RESTRICTED DATA DECLASSIFICATION DECISIONS 1946 TO THE PRESENThttp://www.fas.org/sgp/othergov/doe/rdd-7.htmlcontained in section C of that document are the following facts:Information on the DOE's pure fusion program:(1) Fact that the DOE made a substantial investment in the past to develop a pure fusion experimental explosive device(2) That the U.S. does not have and is not developing a pure fusion weapon; and(3) That no credible design for a pure fusion weapon resulted from the DOE investment. (98-15)Note: Point 3 may be disputed.Inertial confinement fusion is the only form of fusion that has actually already beenOnce classified Halite-Centurion test shots experimentally proved that small sub-gram DT filled spheres could be ignited and brought to full fusion ignition using an intense beam of X-rays.ICF fusion has already been PROVEN to work. If fusion drivers are designed that sufficiently resemble the characteristics and performance of X-ray driver used in Halite-Centurion experiments, there is no question that full fusion ignition with fusion energy gain will be practically achieved. Practical fusion is not a matter of guesswork or conjecture but has alreay been PROVEN in actual field experiments by both LANL and LLNL National Labs in the last years of underground nuclear testing at the Nevada Nuclear Security Site.NY Times article published at the time of Halite-Centurion field tests -","220,149 followers",Franklin Veaux,8.6K,47.3K,779.4M,https://www.quora.com/Can-nuclear-fission-or-fusion-be-controlled

The actual physical fusion reactors are so expensive and time-consuming to build, test, and operate, that you may only get to iterate designs once or twice in a career, but computer simulations can take us in so many different directions more cheaply and easily by comparison.Perhaps there is some exotic stellarator magnetic confinement design, or advanced Farnsworth electrostatic confinement design that has not been explored in depth, that will turn out to hold the key to fusion energy. Simulation is probably the best first step to find it, unless you have a few billion dollars and several hundred kilometers of Niobium-Tin wire and helium cooling tubing to play with.Brent",UNKNOWN,Viktor T.

11,"As others explained, making nuclear fusion happen is relatively easy.But that kind of misses the point. What we want to do is making sustained nuclear fusion.Worse yet, we want to achieve a power density that exceeds the interior of the Sun by something like a factor of a million or so, but without the benefit of the one mechanism that the Sun relies on, gravitational confinement.To wit: Nuclear fusion happens in the deep interior of the Sun because the Sun is colossally massive (more than 300,000 times more massive than the Earth), so its self gravity compresses its interior to the temperaturAs others explained, making nuclear fusion happen is relatively easy.But that kind of misses the point. What we want to do is making sustained nuclear fusion.Worse yet, we want to achieve a power density that exceeds the interior of the Sun by something like a factor of a million or so, but without the benefit of the one mechanism that the Sun relies on, gravitational confinement.To wit: Nuclear fusion happens in the deep interior of the Sun because the Sun is colossally massive (more than 300,000 times more massive than the Earth), so its self gravity compresses its interior to the temperatures and pressures that are needed for fusion to take place.But very, very slowly and inefficiently. How slowly? It produces less than 300 watts of heat per cubic meter. That’s comparable to… a well-maintained compost pile. Its less than the power density of our human metabolism.That’s all. That’s what you get when you lump enough mass to make more than 300,000 Earths.We obviously do not have 300,000 spare Earths to play with, and it would not be very practical either. So we cannot use gravitational confinement. We are trying to use other means to confine the fusion fuel for sustained fusion.And we aren’t simply trying to mimic the Sun. We want to do better. After all, for a practical fusion power generating station, we want to be able to produce a lot more power, perhaps up to a few hundred megawatts of raw thermal power per cubic meter inside the reactor. So we are trying to best the Sun by a factor of a million, give or take.That is hard. That is, if I may use somewhat unprofessional language, damn hard. Insanely hard.Which is why, nearly 70 years after the first uncontrolled fusion explosion (aka. hydrogen bomb) here on the Earth, we still do not have working fusion power stations.I thank my generous supporters on",2 followers,Richard Muller,1.7K,2.3K,201.9M,https://www.quora.com/Why-arent-we-pouring-more-money-into-the-research-of-profitable-nuclear-fusion

What is the order of safety?The ion engine is by far the safest. It simply uses an electrical field to push charged particles out the back of the spacecraft. These engines are really weak, but they're cheaper and safer to use than even the normal rocket engines that power our current spaceships.A plasma engine would work by simply superheating material and pushing it out of the back of the spacecraft (possibly assisted by ion drive-like technology). It's more dangerous than a normal rocket, as it has a higher operating temperature, but it has the advantage that it doesn't rely on any particular chemical reaction, so it can be fueled with any material that's readily available.Antimatter is usually proposed as a powerplant rather than as a true propulsive engine. It's really dangerous, because if the fuel comes into physical contact with any part of your ship, the ship will not merely explode, but also release deadly radiation. But, on the other hand, the main alternative to antimatter in SF is nuclear power (usually fusion, though fission is an option for writers who don't want to project technical advances too far into the future), which also poses significant radiation and explosion risks. In any event, your antimatter or fusion reactor produces heat energy, which can either be directly used to power a plasma drive, or can be converted to electricity to power whatever other systems your futuristic spaceship might have.So, in summary, if the mysterious time traveler gives you an ion drive, that's safe enough. If he gives you a plasma drive, you probably should turn it over to NASA rather than playing with it yourself, but it won't kill you by just sitting there. If he gives you antimatter, though, evacuate immediately. That stuff's nasty.","2,088 followers",Manju Gangadhar,2.5K,141,1.7M,https://www.quora.com/Can-nuclear-fission-or-fusion-be-controlled
13,"Ion Engine. It is electricity and can be cooled as well as controlled with resistors and voltage. Plasma engines require powerful ionization energy and superconducting magnets to work. If either fails, you could have something 10 times worse than the Challenger Accident. Antimatter Engines are the most dangerous. You need Penning Traps or complex magnetic and electric spin apparatus to contain antiparticles. Also annihilating it with normal matter requires enormous safety and emits gamma radiation. It's like trapping yourself with your polar opposite inside a microwave oven.",1 follower,Kevin Baker,728,3.7K,8.8M,https://www.quora.com/Can-nuclear-fission-or-fusion-be-controlled
14,They each have their dangers. An antimatter engine would be the most dangerous and by far the most complex. And the more complex the more likely dangerous errata could creep in. An anti-matter engine would require constant surveillance. And it would very likely destroy the ship and everything in it if something went wrong.,240 followers,Sean Carron,1K,0,0,https://www.quora.com/Can-nuclear-fission-or-fusion-be-controlled
