In every aspect I can possibly imagine, I'm just living the life I really wanted to live.There's so much to do, all the time.Just about every conversation I have with any fellow being in the campus, turns out to be informative and expands what I know.There's nobody forcing me to attend classes regularly, almost everybody doesn't care about attendance.

So I really choose what I want to do with my time.I can attend talks/seminars/conferences/lectures by some of the best people in the world on virtually any topic under the sun. (Last week I went to a spirituality lecture on Swami Vivekananda, I forgot the speaker's name and a public lecture on Quantum Computing by Prof. Raymond Laflamme who did his PhD under Prof. Stephen Hawkings).I have more than enough resources to help me do whatever it is that I want to do - my room (which I own all by myself and is quite big & nice), huge library, super lan connection, amazing faculty (almost all of them are very approachable, kind and patient).. Just about everything you can imagine.There's a lot of space, you can just sit where ever you want to and be on your own. Canteens are nice. Mess food isn't scary. Everything you need you can get inside campus. Even then, Bangalore is a nice place to be if you want to go out. Plus you can easily survive in luxury with your stipend.There's no end to studying, that's one of the first thing you'll learn here. And you wouldn't really wanna stop if you get the hang of it. That's something you'll eventually know. There's no end to possibilities.And it's not all work and no play. There's beauty in the campus, where ever you look at. Bangalore's weather beats every other city in the country.It's very peaceful here in IISc.

The entire process took nearly a year with my interview period lasting roughly 2–3 months. I ended up attending 5 interviews on site and had offers from 3. Here is my story.The Motivation Phase (1 month)As a computer engineering graduate, I had shockingly minimal exposure to statistics and no exposure to machine learning. Initially, the buzz around data science in the tech media got me interested in the area. I pored over blogs, news media and articles online trying to define to myself the idea of a ‘data scientist’ and what makes one successful in the role. This included exploring stories about data science making a difference in diverse fields from healthcare to recruiting to marketing to education to everything in between. Gradually, the hype turned to genuine potential in my mind.Next, I set out to figure out the skills required to become a data scientist. The most popular idea on the net is that a data scientist is a super-human who sits at the intersection of programming, statistical (and ML), math, business domain and communication skills. Additionally, I would also like to throw in familiarity with big data tools like Hadoop/Spark/AWS to the mix based on my experience. I could only check off the software engineering skills (hacking skills) in this Venn diagram! One of my primary complaints with my prior job as a computer architect was that I felt that my learning curve was saturating. With such a vast skills requirement, I knew that there would always something new for me to learn for a very long time!The Knowledge Phase (9 months)The knowledge phase involved signing up for and completing a number of courses online throughList of classes I took but not necessarily in that order (not just skim, but actually complete all the lectures, assignments and mini-projects for the most part):The Skill Building Phase (6 months)This was a super interesting phase.After arming myself with the necessary fundamentals and practical tools (Python, R, mathematical and statistical base), it was time to put them to work. EnterThe second phase of the skills building involved trying to get my hands dirty with real world data science projects.The Interview Phase (3 months)The interview phase is the signaling phase.I applied for interviews in discrete waves. This means that I would apply to 10–15 companies per week and wait for responses. If I got 2–3 responses, I would stop applying for sometime, otherwise I would apply for another handful next week. I also focused on the skills required of the job, and the specific industry while applying because the job ‘Data Scientist’ can take on a surprisingly wide range of possibilities depending on the company.

I think that would give me more credit than is genuinely due, and reduces the role of the people and circumstances that are integral to every story.Yes I certainly worked hard for years, but so do countless other people. And yes, I nurtured an uncommon combination of skills before it was called ‘data science’. But it is easy to say that after the fact - it was just as likely that the world may have turned out a different way, and this particular combination was never recognised.That said - here’s my story:I have struggled with ‘fitting in’ to tidy boxes throughout my academic life and career. All I really wanted to do was find work that engaged all the different parts of me.My first degree was in IT and my first job was a developer in (now defunct) ASP and JSP. Well, at least I coded - so far so good.But… I enjoyed writing in English as much as in code, so I swung to the other extreme and my second role was in communications.But… I found it too fluffy and was horrified by how the nuances behind the numbers were regularly glossed over. I was also good in math and came from a family of business people who thought in dollars - so I decided to load up on statistics modules, do a quantitative MBA, and then joined a management consulting firm.But… I was frustrated with the low use of automation and sophisticated analytical methods and tools which I knew were out there and free to use. So I started learning and using them myself and sharing them with my peers. One of the tools was none other than an early version of R.But… very few people were interested in analytics then, and there was no one to ‘sell’ analytics - so I then spent my time researching how analytics could add value in large companies on my own. Eventually demand for analytics increased, and because I had done the research, I had opportunities beyond my level to communicate advanced analytics to non-technical audiences. This is probably my greatest advantage.But… without the resources at hand today, I was confused on how the myriad of different concepts hung together, so I looked for a mentor - and stumbled on a few rare, ‘real’ data-scientists who have been practising for well over a decade. They drew a roadmap for me to follow long before those appeared on the internet.But… after knowing how it all fitted together, I felt I needed more time to immerse myself in the technical aspects of data science. By this time my peers were moving into well paid senior positions and encouraging me to ‘fake it till I make it’. I however declined and - against conventional wisdom - used up my savings to go for my 3rd degree in analytics as one of the oldest students in my cohort.…and then people started talking about the data scientist unicorn.Of the elusive a...",UNKNOWN,Sujay,551,0,0,https://www.quora.com/Do-you-think-the-earth-is-really-what-NASA-wants-us-to-believe-I-wonder-about-the-limits-the-sky-the-space

Preferably involving computer science and unlimited opportunities. Data mining looked like a perfect fusion of these two, so I decided to enroll to the free educational program organized in Saint-Petersburg by several extremely driven people. Those guys basically wanted to create a community where data-driven projects and technologies could be developed and I was lucky to become one of the early adopters.We didn’t have a refined curricula or a fixed problem set. Instead we attended the talks organized for us with invited experts from every industry. Data warehousing, ETL, banking, ML research, advertising, search you name it. Occasionally we got some homework like “solve a Titanic competition on Kaggle” or “play with MNIST dataset and report your methods and results”. We were enjoying that course, immersing ourselves into the world of analytics and, sometimes, programming - for those who really wanted to.After my freshman year, when the program was finished, I got an offer from one of our mentors to join their startup as an intern. And oh my, what an amazing time I had there. I got to learn from one of the best senior developers in the city who looked omniscient to me and never ceased to amaze with his ability to get things done - at an overwhelming pace. I learned a lot from him, did several projects: predictive analytics, distributed computing (basics, mostly), development and most importantly - getting from research phase to production. We have never touched that part before and it was very illuminating to actually go through the whole process myself.Then was Siemens. I worked there as an engineering intern for a short time after my sophomore year, became addicted to Quora and made a firm decision to move to ML for good. Thanks, Siemens.Shortly after that I landed a remote job as a data scientist in a startup. It was my junior year in university, I knew a couple of algorithms and wanted to prove myself even more. That was a hard learning phase. I didn’t have that guidance as before - I just experimented relentlessly, absorbing the knowledge wherever I could get it.At the same time I decided to try myself in research. Teamed up with amazing people from SPb and Moscow, wrote a paper on applied NLP, learned a lot. Have you noticed how often I mention this word? Every person I’ve met over the course of this journey taught me something. A new tool. A new algorithm. A new TV show to clear my head after coding.The paper was accepted to a local conference and that was essentially the end of my “data science phase”. After that I became more and more interested in AI, tinkering with DL frameworks, going on a new adventure, which took me almost 7000 kilometers from home and connected me with the most incredible people I’ve ever met.But I’ll save it for another answer.",0 followers,Brian Farley,534,704,4.1M,https://www.quora.com/Why-didn%E2%80%99t-Peter-Quill-and-the-Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-visit-Earth-before-the-Infinity-Wars

My Excel skills included very basic formulas and on a good day I could do some very rudimentary pivot tables. Most of my work was very germane and very niche.I was accepted to two programs in grad school as a dual MA student- one in Public Relations and one in International Relations. I accepted the offer thinking that two degrees is better than one. As a dual MA student we were required to arrive during the Summer and take courses in graphic design. I quickly found that I had a knack for making very simple, minimalist designs that conveyed a lot of meaning to the end user, however, I was hoping to obtain a job in national intelligence so why on earth would I need to be able to make pretty looking things in the Adobe suite? I dropped that major thinking that I would never use the skills, but in my spare time I would redo major websites, logos, brands, and publication images for fun.At the same time I would quickly master a topic area, get bored, and move on to another. Same with methodology. The traditional college sequence of math courses wasn’t working for me so I bought some econometrics, probability, and linear algebra texts on Amazon and started reading, but beyond understanding concepts and being able to complete exercises I didn’t really see much applicability in the material. I tried to take a few SQL and R courses in the early MOOC days, but never managed to complete them. Meanwhile I was a bit bored with my course work and as soon as I obtained enough subject matter expertise to reasonably turn a research project into a dissertation I would eventually dissuade myself from doing so because 4 or 5 years seemed like way too long of a time to spend making a case for an argument that very few people would read or care about.A few years passed. I got a fairly entry level job, but it required a lot of Excel knowledge. I quickly realized that every single month we were basically hand-entering financial information from one spreadsheet into another. I built some macros. Soon I realized that I could just query the same info from a few servers and return the result as my finalized spreadsheet with a little bit of SQL. In a few weeks I taught myself enough VBA, SQL, and Python to completely automate my job. I got bored since there were no more challenges and I left.At my next job I was the only “Analyst”. I had to take basic business problems and figure out how we could analyze product metrics to create value propositions for clients of all verticals. Every single A/B test, RCT, or pilot was completely different. Use cases required everything from basic statistics to Naive Bayes models. All that time switching specialities in grad school, all the research methods, and a continued interest in statistics came into play. I finally had some real life examples to use to learn R, which at the time had very few packages today such as the amazing dplyr or ggplot and no IDE such as RStudio. By the time that company disbanded I had self-started and managed enough projects to be proficient in these tools and also dusted off those old linear algebra and other math books. The guy who couldn’t understand why he needed to master math about triangles in college (3 times!)was now fairly skilled in a level of math that would have taken another three years of college to get through. I needed real life examples to learn, not hundreds of problems that emphasized monotony over inquiry.I still felt pretty incomplete. I started Googling subjects I was interested in, looking for data and diving in. Many jobs have coding challenges or tests and I would find copies of those and run through them continually. At this point I was still pretty unsure of myself because unlike many data scientists I had no background in Computer Science, my college transcript had a pretty dismal Math track record, most people seem to think that applied econometrics and statistics without a degree in either means that you weren’t good enough to get past the entry level, and finally my work history was so varied that it was hard to make a case for my skills and abilities.Much to my surprise I actually received a lot of responses for the positions I applied to. At the end of the day there is not a single skill-set that a Data Scientist must possess, but they MUST be able to obtain data from wherever it may lie, process that data so that it is usable, conduct analysis of that data, and distribute the results to their end user in an actionable way. My approach to learning data munging came in handy as I had no preference on querying language, data structure, or anything that someone with more formal experience might have. I learned what I had to get the data I needed, just like in the past. R had advanced so much since I had last learned it and Python was already a powerful tool, so I learned as I went. When I made a mistake, I Stack Overflow’d it, but I also took the time to learn what it was about what I was doing that was causing the error. I learned to write functions when my work was consistent enough to warrant doing so. I started to write C++ when I really needed to optimize my code. Oh, and those graphic design skills- they’re probably the most useful part of my job as my end users are not data wonks and need to see very complex model outputs in a very clean, understandable manner.So, I guess I’m self taught, but I don’t really see it that way. I really like finding new challenges that I know very little about initially and applying various parts of my background to create projects that combine all of my experiences. There is no way I would be close to what I am today if I didn’t have each of these disparate components. I have worked with many people that are experts in specific areas of Data Science that make my skills in that area look amateurish, but I can do the same to them in other areas as well. Our jobs are different and we apply the skills we need to succeed and use our work and challenges to become better and better.Everyone learns differently and there is no “right” way to teach yourself, but after seeing many MOOC superstars be unable to do much with their “skills” when they weren’t fed curated sample data and walked through problems, I highly recommend that people follow their intuition and internal motivation and learn based on the challenges they face in their work and are motivated to pursue. I would be extremely unhappy as just a visual designer or developer and I will never be a master of either, but I continue to improve in those areas because it makes my work better.

Reference:I have known some folks who used to purchase server versions of the Windows OS for personal use just so they could install more memory, but that was a few years ago when upper limits for Windows Desktop weren't as high as they are now.Second, even though the OS can recognize that much memory, that doesn't mean your individual applications can take advantage of that much memory. With lots of RAM you can run more applications at the same time. All modern operating systems use ""Page Files"" where memory is swapped to disk when the OS starts to run low on memory, and compared to pure RAM access, disk access is very sloooooooooooow. More memory means fewer (or hopefully no) disk swaps. But the individual applications themselves probably can't access anywhere near the memory you have available, except *perhaps* in the gaming world.The exception to this is in critical business applications that were designed to use lots of memory. I'm not sure if any of these have upper limits (I didn't really feel like researching individual requirements), but things like architectural and 3D modeling programs (like AutoCAD, etc.), database programs (like Oracle), virtualization hosts (like VMware vSphere), video editing, and such are often written to use excessive amounts of RAM.You could create a virtual hard disk (Finally, you also have to consider how much RAM your physical computer can accept. Most home systems aren't going to provide anywhere near the ability to add that much RAM. You'd need ""workstation"" class PC that can handle more memory, but even then I'm not sure if any off-the-shelf workstation-class hardware can handle that much. Much like the OS, you'd probably have to purchase server class hardware to provide access to that much RAM.How much RAM do you really need?

These Dell R930s are quad socket with quad power supplies (2+2 for redundancy) with 64 DIMMS (Max 4TB RAM). These are used primarily for scientific data analysis using high performance computing approaches. These large memory machines are a necessity for certain types of workload such as genome or metagenomic assemblies, which must be done in a single machine. I have yet to see them use MPI approaches to divide and conquer the problem. The reason being is simple: 1) the algorithms build giant graphs in memory and walk through them 2) the algorithms are written by bioinformaticians and scientists that don't optimize the algorithm. Without having all the memory in one sever, these algorithms simply crash the server when free memory runs out (called thrashing). These assemblies can take days or weeks to complete even in RAM. So, even if we are using SWAP space backed by FusionIO SSDs, the performance is degraded by an order of magnitude or more. These servers run like dogs day in day out for the remainder of their 5 to 7 year life. At a cost of 85K CAD each, they are a bargain for what they provide in enabling scientific research.Another application is large in memory databases to optimize large table joins. Think hundreds of millions of records. Reading all that data from disk for every query would take forever. Fortunately, there are better approaches in RDBMS rather than using large servers such as data sharding and distributed queries.",193 followers,Jerome McCrary,4.2K,0,0,https://www.quora.com/Do-you-think-the-earth-is-really-what-NASA-wants-us-to-believe-I-wonder-about-the-limits-the-sky-the-space
37,"I don’t remember how to count that low…Sorry for the Googler joke, I couldn’t resist. I once had to ask if I could borrow 35 TB of RAM from another SRE team… they said “Um, sure, you can have that for a couple of weeks… we’d like it back eventually”. 1 TB is really not that much. It’s only 4 machines worth.","220,164 followers",Franklin Veaux,1.2K,47.3K,779.6M,https://www.quora.com/Do-you-think-the-earth-is-really-what-NASA-wants-us-to-believe-I-wonder-about-the-limits-the-sky-the-space

40,"For any single piece of data, that might seem excessive, but as soon as you’re working with aggregate data across many users, filling that up and using it effectively for online processing is not hard at all. Streaming analytics, online customer metrics, web caching, or gameplay statistics all fit that use case just fine (not a comprehensive list, we haven’t even started about offline analytics like Spark yet!)You can easily stuff that into a single machine; Dell, HP, Supermicro and the rest will happily sell that to you for not too much money.However, don’t do what I did a few years ago as anFor any single piece of data, that might seem excessive, but as soon as you’re working with aggregate data across many users, filling that up and using it effectively for online processing is not hard at all.

Just calling fork() with that much ram allocated takes 30 seconds, because the Linux memory manager is O(log n) per block, where the log n ends up mattering for large amounts.","220,164 followers",Franklin Veaux,867,47.3K,779.6M,https://www.quora.com/Why-didn%E2%80%99t-Peter-Quill-and-the-Guardians-of-the-Galaxy-visit-Earth-before-the-Infinity-Wars
