His mother was a fruit seller outside a temple.This boy was extremely engrossed in his phone, making animated actions all the while looking at the screen. This piqued my interest so I went and sat next to him.Turns out, he was learning nursery rhymes from YouTube. The video had cartoons reciting the alphabet in an entertaining fashion. He was repeating the alphabet and writing it with his finger on the rock behind him.He seemed to be having a blast, and pulled me in his little game, even though we didn't understand each other's language. I sat next to him for the next ten minutes.This boy who must not be older than 5, had learned on his own to navigate the phone, open YouTube and select videos from the recommendations. He had kick-started his education on his own. He was also watching videos of how cars are manufactured, looking at the process in awe.I could not help but get inspired at how something as simple as access to an internet connection can expand someone's world. Despite coming from underprivileged background, I could sense he was going places. All because he had the curiosity to learn, and now he also had the means to learn. The success of Jio lies in how it has transformed our lives from grassroots. Almost everyone now has an internet connection. It is up to us how we utilise it.",241 followers,Prachi S,3K,51,4.8M,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-impact-of-Reliance-Jio-on-Indian-citizens

Continue your studies :-> Here you have several options:a) Pursue Masters's from IIT by cracking IITJAM or from any other university on Physics and earn a Ph.D. later on. You can also do an Integrated Ph.D. by applying and getting a good rank in JEST, TIFR, IISER, etc.b) Pursue your Masters from any IIT (or from any other University) and then pursue MTech by cracking GATE. After MTech, you can get placed in some PSUs or some reputed MNCs. Many prefer higher studies though (like Ph.D. after Mtech). (P.S - IIT Kharagpur provides Integrated Mtech-PhD for Computer Science and Data Analytics after qualifying in GATE)c) Give an entrance test conducted by a few universities for Btech and get into some good Engineering Colleges. (Ex: Jadavpur University in Kolkata conducts an entrance test for students of BSc(Hons) Physics. Qualified Candidates enter into 2nd year of BTech. Likewise, Calcutta University provides Btech in Radiophysics.)d) Do Bachelors in Education(BEd) for a Teaching Job.e) MSc in other subjects like Biophysics, RadioPhysics, Geophysics, Instrumentation, etc. Ex - MScTech in Geophysics from ISM Dhanbad (Note: the degree mentions MScTech, not MTech; Both are different).f) Other Masters program in other disciplines if you want to do it like MCA, MBA, MA, LLB, etc. (Being interested in Defence Services, personally I would have preferred Masters from Institute of Defence Studies in Pune and Ph.D. later on— a path very few know or like to tread .)g) If you have a Gap in years after your BSc Physics and possess the thought that you will be unable to share the class with the younger generation, feel free to pursue distance learning through IGNOU. You can pursue your master's in other subjects via IGNOU or sit for an entrance examination for MSc. Physics (distance learning) which by the way IGNOU conducts in collaboration with the Indian Institute of Astrophysics (forms available in the month of September).h) You can also pursue higher studies from foreign universities. Of course, you have to crack the competitive exams related to that purpose.2. Get a Job :→ You can Apply for Various entrance examinations for Banks(RBI Grade B, SBI PO, IBPS, etc), Railways( ASM, Goods Guard, JE, RPF SI, etc), PSUs or State Units(AAI ATC, Electricity Executives, Forest Guard, etc), Armed Forces(AFCAT, CDSE, Coast Guard(only interview) ), Civil Services(UPSC CSE, State CSE, IFoS) and Central/State Police Services( SSC CAPF, UPSC CAPF, SSC CGL, etc). Crack these Examinations and earn a respectable service with the Central or State Governments or Banking Sector or PSUs.(PS: If you have completed MSc Physics then you can apply to the Indian Navy as an Officer or else not. Indian Navy does not recruit candidates having just BSc in Physics. You either should have BTech or do MSc Physics- the condition valid even in UPSC CDSE recruitment)→ If you want a job in your core field(subject), there are exams like ISRO Scientific Assistant, SSC IMD Scientific Assistant, BHAVINI Scientific Assistant, NCPOR Scientific Assistant(which do not conduct any exam but only Personal Interview), NPCIL Scientific Assistant, etc. which too are Govt Organisations that requires Bachelor’s in Physics as a qualification.(PS- If you complete MSc in Physics however you can apply for a relatively higher position in similar organizations for the post of Scientific Officer - Some institutes like BARC do not recruit candidates having a degree less than that of MSc.)You know the craze for Government Jobs, Don’t you? Some Jobs are indeed Earned. :)→ However, You can always find a Job in the Corporate Sector. Ex: TCS, WIPRO, etc.So, All the very Best if getting a Job is your sole Aim.P.S - Build and Develop Skills via sites(also Android App) like Udemy, Coursera, edX, Skillshare, Codecademy, Allison, etc. Trust me sometimes recruiters will be much interested if they learn that you have invested some quality time in having knowledge which can give you an edge over other candidates. Also makes your Resume look quite attractive. Moreover guess what, most courses are totally free of cost.

36,"Just after my first blog may 10th students and college graduates were asking me, How did you find the job after BCom. One person was so stressed he tried to commit suicide, just because he failed in CA Exam. So now in this blog I will try to tell you guys how and what are the field were you can find the good job after BCom.I would like to start with my own experience first, I was an average student in 10th so I just scored 51.84%, after 10th I decided to do commerce, I got admission in St. Xavier’s college, and passed it by 67%. I was also worried about future, I didn’t any idea what to chooseJust after my first blog may 10th students and college graduates were asking me, How did you find the job after BCom. One person was so stressed he tried to commit suicide, just because he failed in CA Exam. So now in this blog I will try to tell you guys how and what are the field were you can find the good job after BCom.I would like to start with my own experience first, I was an average student in 10th so I just scored 51.84%, after 10th I decided to do commerce, I got admission in St. Xavier’s college, and passed it by 67%. I was also worried about future, I didn’t any idea what to choose for Graduation. I didn’t have anyone in my family who is literate and can help me to decide. Many of friends were doing BBA, BA, BSC and BCom. But I on the other hand had no idea. I went to B.K college to see the campus and I saw one chart there, it was similar to the below chart. Were are the possible job options are shown. It gave me some confidence. Then I fearlessly took admission for Bcom. For 5 Semester I didn’t worried at all about the future, I just wanted to enjoy my college days. And I did the same. In the 5th semester I heard the news that TCS is going conduct the campus drive at RLS college. We talked about this to our Placement officers at college. He suggested us not to go for the interview as it is a multinational company and there will be many students from top colleges and you don’t have a chance there. But who wanted to get selected we just wanted to attend the interview and get some experience. We four friends went to attend the drive and gave the aptitude test. There were around 600-700 students from deferent colleges. And after waiting for an hour or two. They declared the results out of 4 of us 2 were cleared the aptitude.And just like that we both cleared HR around, Technical round and finally the Telephonic round. It all went very fast. And at the end of the day we both had a job in our hands.In TCS I was in Accounts Receivable profile ( Bills Receivable) and after 3 years now I am in the same field of finance in the post of Senior Officer in Wipro Ltd.Below I would like to list the qualities and skills you should learn, it is my personal thoughts.· Work on your confidence:As we all know confidence is the key to success. And its true in my case, confidence played a very important roll. You can improve you confidence by speaking in Public, hosting a seminar etc.· Learn to use Excel, Word, Power Point, Tally:Having an extra knowledge about the basic computer features is very important.· General Knowledge:You should hold some knowledge about the current affaires and some basis stuff.· Don’t be a bookworm:Lots of friends who used to seat on the first bench, never missed a single class are still looking for the Job. I am not telling to bunk every class. But sitting all the class just for the attendance doesn’t make much sense to me. You can gain the more knowledge by doing your own studies.From 3rd to 6th Sem, I didn’t attended a single class but still I able to graduate with 75%. You will ask how? Did you copied? No the answer is self study. Believe me it much more effective that a class room study. You can visualize the concepts on your own way and find the solution for the same. Its like and adventure. If you haven’t done it yet. Then you must try it.Now I will list the Job opportunities after BCom.· Accountant· Customer Service Representative· Associate ( Insurance, Banking, Shipping, Oil Industry)· Accounts Receivable· Accounts Payable· Information Process Analyst· Data Entry· BPO· BPS· Govt. Jobs· Marketing· Retail Store· ArmyAnd many more jobs in the corporate sector, don’t take much tension about the future. Everything will be fine, just work hard and grab any chance you get. and remember finding a job is not the only motive you have born for, you can do much for than that. just be calm. Everything will happen at the right time.Enjoy your college days now. They are not coming back once you get the Job.Keep reading, keep Smiling, Keep Faith.Upvote if you like.","5,725 followers",Valorie Lennox,600,8.6K,41.2M,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-impact-of-Reliance-Jio-on-Indian-citizens

If you have aspirations to get a PhD then youAlso, avoid getting into silly heated political debates in class, there are many many opinionated and woefully naive individuals on political science degrees. Do your reading, make nice with lecturers for references and hand all work in on time and to the highest possible standard. You will thank yourself on graduation day.Next.You need to decide if you want a government career or a commercial career. Most of my graduating class went into one of the two. The government careers are usually easier / less well paid and consist of paper pushing. The great thing is they areNote: Careers at the UN or another supra-national org are on short contracts (up to 18 months). So you'll switch jobs a lot before you settle down. This really isn't ideal for people who want families.If you want a commercial career do the following:1/ Learn to code and focus explicitly on data science / analytical languages i.e. Python, R or SQL. This is a rock solid skill-set combined with excel will help you.2/ Work experience. Get in the door somewhere and start building up skills, references and contacts. Be very aggressive and throw sharp elbows to get this experience. By graduation if you play your cards right you will have a lot of experience. Use your free time and weekends to get work experience. You can party and have a social life in the evenings.Your focus really needs to be on brand name employers or working directly for extremely established individuals. After you land these names on your cv you can move on to more obscure, riskier options with higher upside potential.3/ If you do points 1 + 2 correctly then you can network with purpose. What I mean by this is go to every careers event / speak engagement and offer to help this person in some way. If you are smart you will have built up a portfolio of skills / projects / open-source contributions to show off. 100% of your peers will not compete with you on this, trust me.4/ Get lucky. To do this focus on meeting as many people at University who are already working professionals or senior and get on their radar. Ask for help, offer help, find out how to get work experience. This is the biggest ticket to getting lucky and requires solid effort for 3-4 years. It will not happen straight away.Honestly, the cliche careers of doing law (waste of time, great way to get into debt) or media (no full time jobs just contracts) or political careers (little chance of making money to even survive / be happy / pretend to save the world) are not great options.I went to one of the best schools in the world for political science. The people who have clearly done the best and are happy are normally happily employed by a private sector employee, in a relationship and are saving to buy or have bought homes. Some are further a long and have been married with kids all before 30. This is out of maybe 200-300 people across two different universities in Europe.The rest are working in largely poorly run or funded charitable orgs / NGOs and have no chance of really having a sustainably positive life. It is a sad state of affairs but no one will actually take these people seriously if they want a proper political career I'm afraid.Right now we are living in a golden age of opportunity, technology and the ability to up-skills over and over again. Do not go down the cliche routes in the careers department you are all worth so much more than that and can have a much greater impact on the world.","84,622 followers",Adam Fayed,1K,3.6K,475.1M,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-impact-of-Reliance-Jio-on-Indian-citizens
