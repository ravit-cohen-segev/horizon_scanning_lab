I was working at the Apple Store and I wanted a change. I wanted to start building the tech I was servicing.I started looking into Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI).There’s so much going on in the field.Every week it seems like Google or Facebook are releasing a new kind of AI to make things faster or improve our experience.Don’t get me started on the number of self-driving car companies. This is a good thing though. I’m not a fan of driving and roads are dangerous.Even with all this happening, there’s still yet to be an agreed definition of what exactly artificial intelligence is.Some argue deep learning can be considered AI, others will say it’s not AI unless it passes the Turing Test.This lack of definition really stunted my progress in the beginning. It was hard to learn something which had so many different definitions.Enough with the definitions.How did I get started?My friends and I were building a web startup. It failed. We gave up due to a lack of meaning. But along the way, I was starting to hearing more and more about ML and AI.“The computer learns the things for you?” I couldn’t believe it.I stumbled across Udacity’s Deep Learning Nanodegree. A fun character called Siraj Raval was in one of the promo videos. His energy was contagious. Despite not meeting the basic requirements (I had never written a line of Python before), I signed up.Three weeks before the course start date I emailed Udacity support asking what the refund policy was. I was scared I wouldn’t be able to complete the course.I didn’t get a refund. I completed the course within the designated timeline. It was hard. Really hard at times. My first two projects were handed in four days late. But the excitement of being involved in one of the most important technologies in the world drove me forward.Finishing the Deep Learning Nanodegree, I had guaranteed acceptance into either Udacity’s AI Nanodegree, Self-Driving Car Nanodegree or Robotics Nanodegree. All great options. I was a little lost. “Where do I go next?”I needed a curriculum. I’d built a little foundation with the Deep Learning Nanodegree, now it was time to figure out where I’d head next.My Self-Created AI Masters DegreeI didn’t plan on going back to university anytime soon. I didn’t have $100,000 for a proper Masters Degree anyway.So I did what I did in the beginning. Asked my mentor, Google, for help.I’d jumped into deep learning without any prior knowledge of the field. Instead of climbing to the tip of the AI iceberg, a helicopter had dropped me off on the top.After researching a bunch of courses, I put a list of which ones interested me the most in Trello.Trello is my personal assistant/course coordinator.I knew online courses had a high drop out rate. I wasn’t going to let myself be a part of this number. I had a mission.To make myself accountable, I started sharing my learning journey online. I figured I could practice communicating what I learned plus find other people who were interested in the same things I was. My friends still think I’m an alien when I go on one of my AI escapades.I made the Trello board publicThe curriculum has changed slightly since I first wrote it but it’s still relevant and I visit the Trello board multiple times per week to track my progress.Getting a jobI bought a plane ticket to the US with no return flight. I’d been studying for a year and I figured it was about time I started putting my skills into practice.My plan was to rock up to the US and get hired.Then Ashlee messaged me on LinkedIn, “Hey I’ve seen your posts and they’re really cool, I think you should meet Mike.”I met Mike.I told him my story of learning online, how I loved healthtech and my plans to go to the US.“You may be better off staying here a year or so and seeing what you can find, I’ think you’d love to meet Cameron.”I met Cameron.We had a similar chat what Mike and I talked about. Health, tech, online learning, US.“We’re working on some health problems, why don’t you come in on Thursday?”Thursday came. I was nervous. But someone once told me being nervous is the same as being excited. I flipped to being excited.I spent the day meeting the Max Kelsen team and the problems they were working on.Two Thursday’s later, Nick, the CEO, Athon, lead machine learning engineer, and I went for coffee.“How would you like to join the team?” Asked Nick.“Sure.” I said.My US flight got pushed back a couple months, I’ve also got a return ticket.Sharing your workLearning online, I knew it was unconventional. All the roles I’d gone to apply for had Masters Degree requirements or at least some kind of technical degree.I didn’t have either of these. But I did have the skills I’d gathered from a plethora of online courses.Along the way, I was sharing my work online. My GitHub contained all the projects I’d done, my LinkedIn was stacked out and I’d practiced communicating what I learned through YouTube and articles on Medium.I never handed in a resume for Max Kelsen. “We checked you out on LinkedIn and we were impressed.” My body of work was my resume.Regardless if you’re learning online or through a Masters Degree, having a portfolio of what you’ve worked on is a great way to build skin in the game.ML and AI skills are in demand but that doesn’t mean you don’t have to showcase them. Even the best product won’t sell without any shelf space.Whether it be GitHub, Kaggle, LinkedIn or a blog, have somewhere where people can find you. Plus, having your own corner of the internet is great fun.How do you start?Where do you go to learn these skills? What courses are the best?There’s no best answer. Everyone’s path will be different. Some people learn better with books, others learn better through videos.What’s more important than how you start is why you start.Start with why.Again, no right reason. All are valid in their own way.Start with why because having a why is more important than how. Having a why means when it gets hard and itGot a why? Good. Time for some hard skills.I can only recommend what I’ve tried.I’ve completed courses from (in order):They’re all world class. I’m a visual learner. I learn better seeing things being done/explained to me on. So all of these courses reflect that.If you’re an absolute beginner, start with some introductory Python courses and when you’re a bit more confident, move into data science, machine learning and AI.How much math?The highest level of math education I’ve had was in high school. The rest I’ve learned through Khan Academy as I’ve needed it.There are many different opinions on how much math you need to know to get into machine learning and AI. I’ll share mine.If you want to apply machine learning and AI techniques to a problem, you don’t necessarily need an in-depth understanding of the math to get a good result. Libraries such as TensorFlow and PyTorch allow someone with a bit of Python experience to build state of the art models whilst the math is taken care of behind the scenes.If you’re looking to get deep into machine learning and AI research, through means of a PhD program or something similar, having an in-depth knowledge of the math is paramount.In my case, I’m not looking to dive deep into the math and improve an algorithm’s performance by 10%. I’ll leave that to people smarter than me. Instead, I’m more than happy to use the libraries available to me and manipulate them to help solve problems as I see fit.What does a machine learning engineer actually do?What a machine engineer does in practice might not be what you think.Despite the cover photos of many online articles, it doesn’t always involve working with robots that have red eyes.Here are a few questions an ML engineer has to ask themselves daily.I borrowed these from a great article by Rachel Thomas, one of the co-founders ofFor more, I made a video of what we usually get up to on Monday’s at Max KelsenNo set pathThere’s no right or wrong way to get into ML or AI.The beautiful thing about this field is we have access to some of the best technologies in the world, all we’ve got to do is learn how to use them.You could begin by learning Python code.You could begin by studying calculus and statistics.You could begin by learning about the philosophy of decision making.Machine learning and AI fascinates me because of this intersection of fields.The more I learn about it, the more I realise there’s plenty more to learn. And this hypes me up.Sometimes I get frustrated when my code doesn’t run. Or I don’t understand a concept. So I give up temporarily. I give up by letting myself walk away from the problem and take a nap. Or go for a walk. When I come back it feels like I’m looking at it with different eyes. The excitement comes back. I keep learning.There’s so much happening in the field it can be daunting to get started. Too many options lead to no options. Ignore this.Start wherever interests you most and follow it. If it leads to a dead end, great, you’ve figured out what you’re not interested in. Retrace your steps and take the other fork in the road instead.Computers are smart but they still can’t learn on their own.

But if you are given only the tire, it might belong to a truck or whatever, you are not 99% sure anymore.Machine learning is often like that. We model our problems so that its outputs are probabilities of things because it follows our intuitions. Image classifiers usually work like this:Animal Image => (computation) => Result: [85% cat, 10% dog, 3% dolphin, 2% fish]This can be rewritten as follow:PIntuition aside, ML is rooted in statistics and probability so using both of these in ML is a given.

After watching so many reviews in different sites I finally decided to take admission there. After few days my parents decided to visit the campus. We reached Chandigarh and asked a cab driver to take us to Chandigarh University. But instead of CU he took us to PU i.e Punjab University.I was shocked seeing none of the local people knew about the college. It took almost 3 hours to us finally reach there. The University is almost 30km away from Chandigarh and located in a rural area where direct transportation is also not available. My dad then talked with some of the teachers about placements and they were saying Chandigarh University have the best placement record in North India.(Bits,Thapar,PEC,Nit Jalandhar,iit delhi,Thapar,Nsit these colleges may be joke to them).They also told to register as soon as possible because not so many seats are left. So after all these I have taken admission.Now I am in second semester and I would like to figure some points.1.Admission Criteria for getting admission in this University is just 50%.So if you have passed your boards anyhow and not able to get any seats in engineering colleges then relax….. CU is there for you. Isn't that a cool fact now a days getting any branch in engineering colleges is so tough but they are providing seats with just passing marks.2. You won't find a single professor who is mature. Most of them have completed there masters from some local colleges in Punjab Or from CU itself.3. Assignment gonna be worst nightmare for you. They will give tons and tons of assignment.And also they have a unique way of teaching,they provide ppts. You won't find a book from a single students.4.Hostels are quite good but the messfood is way more bad than u could imagine. There are So many canteens and dhabas attached to the university and may be all of them are millionaires,because most of the students preffer eating from there.5.They boast that the campus is smoke free. But u will find students smoking just 50 metre away from the campus.There is a shop where all the smokers group assemble daily.6.Here u will only get to know how to pass in exams…trust me no such real knowledge are being provided.7.Every morning u will find 10 to 15 security guards saying “ID card galech paoo sare”(wear your ID cards).They are literally much more serious in checking id cards than anything else8.Regarding placements they claim CU have 100% placements records but the truth is only some service based companies like Tcs,Wipro who doesn't give anything beyond 20 to 25k per month. They conduct joint placement drive in which 4–5 other universities also sit in the placements season. And 31 lakh placement from Amazon Was also by a student from cgc which CU claims to be as their student.9.Most of the students are here only to enjoy college life.And they are mostly from punjab,Haryana ,Himachal,Jammu, Uttarakhand.Some of them are not able to speak a single word in English.10.All the good reviews in Quora or other sites are written are by their fix people. In every question regarding the university you will find the same fucking answers by them.Before opting for engineering here I have so many dreams. I wanted to complete my PhD from Stanford University. Now I am totally fucked up. I have gone anonymous because they may take actions against me. So make your decision wisely. And I don't want anyone to make the mistake which I did.",UNKNOWN,Anonymous,1.8K,0,0,https://www.quora.com/Which-are-the-top-20-papers-related-to-AI-both-machine-learning-symbolic-so-that-I-can-cover-the-basics-and-choose-a-niche-for-my-research

7,"Although there is an obvious connection between salary and hours in the legal world (you're paid a lot because you're expected to be on call 24/7 to perform work that is difficult and tedious at times), the high compensation and high hours also have separate reasons for existing.First, on salary, you have to understand that most large, sophisticated law firms operate on what is known as a ""leverage model.""

That is, partners make a large part of their money by having younger lawyers spend 2,000+ hours billing each year at a (comparatively) low salary. An individual partner may only generate $1 million in annual revenue based on his/her own time, but if 4 associates are working on that partner's cases and collectively generate $3 million more, that partner is going to take home a lot of money. That's the joy of leverage. But because most young lawyers will leave their firms within 5 years, this means that most large, profitable firms require a steady stream of new associates each year to keep revenue flowing. And of course, large firms can't have just anyone doing associate work: they need people who are (a) at least theoretically capable of being partners down the road and (b) credentialed enough to justify the high billable rates associated with their work. Accordingly, anyone who is competing at the top of the legal profession wants whatever they consider to be the ""best"" talent available.The reality, of course, is that firms are not alike in size, quality, or profitability. There are large firms that make ridiculous amounts of money, and those that are barely staying afloat. There are also smaller firms that make as much or more than larger competitors. But for law students, it's very difficult to distinguish between Large Firm X, Large Firm Y, and Boutique Z--in fact, a lot of firms go out of their way to be opaque in their dealings with young lawyers. One thingWhen I was a law student, first-year associates were paid $125,000/yr. Then, in 2005, a handful of firms announced $135k, and within a few months, almost everyone was up to $135k. For a brief moment thereafter, salaries then went to $145k, and while firms were catching up, a handful of places went to $160k in late 2006/early 2007, and that was the market rate until very recently--the 2008 recession, the large number of people attending law school, and generally low legal demand created an oversupply of talented associates, so no one felt pressure to increase salaries. But once Cravath announced $180k in 2016, most peer firms (and many non-peers) followed suit. A firm that doesn't pay at the top of the market is at a serious disadvantage when it comes to associate recruiting, at least in large cities: again, most young lawyers are not going to know the differences in firms, and perhaps not even care, but no one is going to be excited about being paid less to do essentially the same type and quantity of work. Anyone who has options--and the most promising young lawyers are going to have options--is going to take the higher salary. So that's how we have the $180k figure, and why any firm that wants to get the most promising law students has to pay it.As for why firms hire fewer lawyers and ask them to do more, it's just a question of resources and allocation. The true cost of an associate is much more than just his/her salary; there are also benefits, office space, support staff, etc., not to mention time and money invested on training. Training in particular is very important: although most large firms expect that the majority of their young lawyers will not last more than a few years, they still need for some to become senior associates, and a few to become future partners. Whether you are a litigator or a transactional lawyer, the only way to learn how to be an effective lawyer is to immerse yourself in the work and learn every aspect of what needs to be done. Someone who is incapable of handling complex tasks is a potential liability once they reach a higher level of seniority.Unfortunately, this means that sometimes, you will be working insane hours, but a lawyer needs to be present for important events, e.g., a summary judgment filing or a deal closing, even if they occur at inconvenient times. You can't learn how to be an effective lawyer merely by reading a book or by hearing what a colleague does; you have to get your hands dirty on a variety of tasks. There's not some magic point where a partner is going to say ""you've been here X number of years, so I guess I should give you tougher work to do."" Rather, the partnership will have wanted to see you complete discrete tasks well before trusting you with more complex work. Many firms struggle to train and evaluate the associates they have now, so the idea that a firm could significantly increase headcount and find sufficient opportunities for young lawyers is a pipe dream. Bottom line, this is the same reason why physicians-in-training often work long shifts, as opposed to dropping in 4 hours here or there; it's not just about the time, it's about training, and making sure that training is both wide and deep. A partner or senior associate who cannot lead or provide key support to a senior partner is useless.Again, ours is a for-profit business; the total cost of a major firm first-year associate (including office space, FICA taxes, training, bonus, etc.) is likely well north of $300,000/yr, perhaps significantly so in certain markets. After an associate clears that threshold in collected revenue, the rest is profits for the partnership; partners rationally prefer to have a single lawyer generate $800,000 in revenue ($500,000 or so of which is profit) than take that revenue and divide it up among two lawyers. Even accepting the reduction in salary/bonus, you're still likely looking at $200k+/yr per lawyer, meaning less profit at the end of the day, assuming that the two lawyers bill more or less the same as one (which makes sense, as associates can only bill when they have work, and clients will not, and should not, pay for duplication).Some associates might be happier with their quality of life under this arrangement, and would therefore last longer at the firm, but associate retention is not an issue for most firms. To the contrary, most shops likely haveAnd finally, from a management perspective, the more attorneys approach makes no sense, either for a partner or a client. Let's just use a piece of litigation as an example; most cases are going to have complex facts and myriad supporting documents, because clients don't pay hundreds of dollars per hour for things they can handle themselves. I may not have to review every document produced in a case, but in order to do my job, my entire team needs to have a firm understanding of what the case is about and what's going on, which takes time and costs clients money. Getting up to speed on the facts, making sure you're constantly informed on case events, attending team meetings, etc.: these costs multiply when you add more lawyers to a team. All things being equal, a client would rather pay 3 lawyers to work their tails off than 6 lawyers who are working less, because at least the former approach avoids a lot of bloat and duplication of work. Similarly, clients are generally more comfortable having a small number of people who are experts on the case and who they can speak to whenever issues arise. In contrast, no one--lawyers included--feels comfortable knowing that there are people several links down the chain of command who are nonetheless responsible for important parts of the case. The more people you add to a team, the more likely it is that work will be duplicated, lines of communication will fail, and/or mistakes will be made. It's always easier to manage a small team than it is a large one, so the preference, both of firm and client, is going to be to staff the right people and work them as hard as necessary.",UNKNOWN,Charles S.,978,6.7K,39.3M,https://www.quora.com/Which-are-the-top-20-papers-related-to-AI-both-machine-learning-symbolic-so-that-I-can-cover-the-basics-and-choose-a-niche-for-my-research
8,"Short answer: unschooled fish, numbers game, and the fact that the law firm structure is essentially stupid and outdated.Unschooled fish:  When you graduate from law school, you think you are completely qualified to practice law, but really you are only qualified to go to the bathroom in a law firm.  You know absolutely nothing about practicing law.  Why?  Because the people who teach law school are rarely the same people as those who practice.

You know absolutely nothing about practicing law.  Why?  Because the people who teach law school are rarely the same people as those who practice.  In fact, at the top tier schools (and second tier), most professors have gone straight from a top law school to a top LLM program, to teaching.  You're lucky if they even took the bar exam.  They love the academic environment, and they've published many papers on the topic on which they opine...er...teach.  However, many have never spent a single day in practice.  That's for the adjunct professors - the ones with the great stories, who start classes with titles like: Confessions and Beer, and never get tenure because they were too busy practicing to publish anything.I sat on my school's hiring committee and its curriculum committee, and argued until I was hoarse about the idiocy of teaching what is essentially a trade as if it were a liberal arts graduate program.  What use is ""Jurisprudential Theory from 1820 to Today"" when you've got 3 contracts to revise and no idea how to use track changes?  And for Christ's sake, please hire people who can actually tell us what different professions are like in practice.  No luck.  But these people are old and in cushy jobs and see no reason to change.  I think the only reason they even had meetings was for the spectacular catering (thank you, Sutton Place, if you still exist!).So you have a bunch of squeaky new, off-the-shelf, still in the box 1st years who think they have ""experience"" because they summered at the firm and wrote 3 memos in between expensed trips to Cuba Libre (4 courses, please), the customary golf outing, and tossing back shots at the Lower East Side dive du jour.  They can't do anything legal on their own.  They can do some basic research (time consuming), and read documents (but not necessarily knowing what they're looking for).  They've got massive debt, and despite all of the other advertised options happily sallied forth by law schools, career counselors, and parents - no real possibilities other than practicing law (which, statistically, 90% of them will no longer want to do in 5 years).So, what do we do with these eager young fish?  We have to turn them into lawyers somehow.  And we really have no idea who will be useful and who won't be.  We have to take them all and figure it out later.  So, voila - enter the law firm structure.Numbers game:  So this flood of fish wash in, and the firms need to do something with them.  They basically do some simple weeding based on very basic things like GPA, school, how professional you look, your name (not kidding - there are studies about this), your age (more studies), blah blah - none really have any bearing on how good you are, but more about how well you play a system.  Essentially, if you were really good at high school, you'll be good at a big firm.  High school not so great?  Go back before the loans come due.It's a pyramid structure, with the highest volume at the base (the first years), and essentially a lock-step progression with key weed-out years (called ""up or out"") in years 4, 7 (the year before Partnership), and during the Junior to Senior Partnership split.  It used to be that once you were a partner you were golden, but no longer.  That pie is getting smaller, and the partners getting hungrier.The biggest weed-out is year 4 - when your manual labor is used up, and you don't justify the higher brain cost of a 4th year, which is generally running your own deal/case (with oversight).  Lots of lateral moves at this point.  Lots are starting to move this to year 3, which just makes those loan payments even worse (and you look so much worse to prospective future employers, because they know why you didn't last).If you make it to year 7, then you're great to run deals, you've got the brain for it - but you can't bring in clients, or they just don't think you're worth a piece of the action.  Only in this business do you put 7 to 8 years of sweat equity in and walk away with basically nothing (except the clients you wrest away).So, why do year 1s, who can't do ANY of this, get over $100K?  Well, blame Latham and Watkins.  1st years used to get paid according to their location - based on size of firm, value of business and cost of living.  So, you could be working at SuperMegaFirm Skadden Arps (secretly building the Death Star, I'm pretty sure) in Nashville, and you'd be making about 2/3 the salary of someone in Skadden's NYC office.  That's cost of living difference.Then, around 1996, Latham decided to do across the board salaries based on their NYC salaries.  WHAAAA???! you say?  Exactly.  So you live in Charlotte, NC, spend less than 2/3 on cost of living, and make NYC bling?  SCORE!!!  How many people were lining up at Latham's door that year AT EVERY OFFICE (which never happens)?  I think the lines all joined somewhere in St. Louis.  Chaos ensued.  Suddenly, all major firms, like the lemming conformists they are, followed suit.  Across the board pay increase.  Which, of course, increase the pay for all other attorneys (lock-step pay, remember?).  New lawyers cheer.  Applications flood into law schools.  And then....partner profits decline.  Who saw that coming?  Wait, you need to understand financials to run a business?  (Didn't someone write a blog about that? (Re: see, e.g., mine:Firms start getting risky in order to grow and gain clients - they start taking profits and equity in clients in order to grow.  The market collapses.  Firms fold as they realize they cannot sustain the salaries with new online options, inside self-destruction (read about the collapse of famed firms Brobeck and Wolf Block - both epic).  Lawyers start flooding the market - entire classes lose their promised positions, lawyers with no real experience try to start their own firms (3rd year at a big firm is not actual experience).  Mass failure.  Firms get bought up cheap.  Lawyers start advertising themselves for jobs on craigslist (seriously).  Chaos reigns.  Great job, Latham.  And, uh, you other lemming firms, too.What do 1st -3rd years do?  Basically, grunt work.  They are learning to be lawyers on the client's dime.  That's what law firms are - giant sweat factories that teach lawyers the actual trade of law.  But the clients are paying for it.  A chunk of that charge for whatever service goes to ""overhead,"" and that overhead isn't the office, the location, the computers, etc (well, it is that, but not just that) - it's the salaries of those grunts, who are spending 2-4x longer doing everything than the senior people, and doing it wrong, and getting corrected.  That's part of what clients pay for.  And to the last point...Law firm is stupid and outdated:  Law firms were originally designed to be places of apprenticeship and practice.  Ok, check.  Apprenticeship happening (sort of, with lots of tears in bathroom stalls, rampant gossip, and some random sex with people who are way less ugly at 3 am).  Legal practice happening.  But the 3 years of law school didn't happen - the training happened in the firm.  (Side note: in California, there's a remnant of this in a small loophole in the bar exam requirements - it's one of the only states that doesn't require applicants to graduate from an accredited law school.  Apprenticing at a law firm, among other things, is a suitable substitute.)  Accordingly, the need to earn scads of money to pay of $100K or more in debt was not an issue.  (Trust me - when you have this much in debt, your decisions are completely different, especially if you have or want to start a family.)  Hours were more reasonable, as were client expectations.  It was simply a business.  Salaries, however, were closer to $60K on average, which would make many attorneys throw up on their mortgage envelopes.However, now the costs are much higher.  Salaries, beginning with the first years, are enormous.  That increases with each year, and partners expect a payoff.  That is the opposite of every other business, in which owners get what is left over, and hope for a bonus year.  Partners EXPECT a payoff in partnership years.  They worked for it, they brought x, y and/or z client in, and dammit, if they don't get the payout, they are taking x, y, z, and a-d with them.  They have options, you know..!I bring you the Triangle of Failure - the reason law firms are designed to fail.  They have oppositional interests among the parties involved.  Por ejemplo:Side 1: the Firm itself (well, really, the Partners).  They are hungry for productivity and money, they want revenue.  Money money money MUH-NAY - MUUUH-NAAAY. (It's that song from the O-Jays.  Sounds better in my head.)Side 2 is the Workers.  They want time off.  Seriously.  However much they're getting, it gets old, and it's not enough.  I worked 20 hour days 10 days in a row at one point, until it slowed down to 16 hour days.  I knew my shower much better than my bed (for which I'm sure my colleagues were grateful).  But that's everyone.  The requirement of face time in the firm, poor management of time on the part of partners and clients, ridiculous deadlines (there are no corporate law emergencies that are not completely made up.  ever.  period.), and the ""hurry up and wait"" environment that make long hours a standard instead of an aberration.  They did not sign up to live like minions indefinitely - but they need to in order to make it to year 8.  This is how so many female attorneys find themselves 40 and single, and wondering what the hell happened to their fertility.  And men find themselves miserable and 40 and divorced.  No matter how much you say ""I could do that, no problem"" - could you really?  It's not something to consider lightly.  Their 30s are calling, and 2 or 3 hours here or there is tough to call a life.  Their incentive is do things as quickly as possible, but say it took longer.  Yes, that's fraud.  And it's everywhere.  Billable hours are a bitch.Side 3 are the Clients.  They want good work at the lowest possible price (wouldn't you?) - generally what they're sold, incidentally.  They believe they are hiring a firm because they are hiring specialists, which means efficiency.  But look at what they're actually hiring.  A built-in sweatshop paying US dollars, which they never knew they were paying for, Side 1's constant demand for more money from the clients (upsell, find out what else we can do for them, get more money from them however you can, INCREASE REVENUES, NOT EFFICIENCY), and Side 2's need to avoid merging into some Borg-like form of the Firm, which may mean increasing efficiency, but not workload - which may mean increasing fraud.  So who gets screwed?  The clients.  Every time.I have redlined every single legal bill I've gotten.  Every one.  I have caught fraud several times, including paralegals billing me when I was a closed file.  That firm, incidentally, did not thank me.  I turned a $15K legal bill into a $3K one - more than once.  I regularly need to chop 40% or more off the bills I receive.  I have fired more attorneys as an entrepreneur than I did heading a practice or running my own.  I have seen more people try to copy work as their own and try to bill it as if they had drafted it from scratch - once it was a document I had written!  (Several have become templates on the internet.  Nothing I can do about it.  But I'm not paying someone for it.)There's a much better way to do this, but this one persists.  Why?  Because it's still making money for some rich white men who control a lot of things that powerful people care about.  Eventually they'll die.  They eat pretty fatty foods, overall.  So there's that.Then we can discuss modifying the law firm and the legal industry.Thanks for the opportunity to discuss this.Kind regards,",130 followers,Stephen Spelman,582,0,0,https://www.quora.com/Which-are-the-top-20-papers-related-to-AI-both-machine-learning-symbolic-so-that-I-can-cover-the-basics-and-choose-a-niche-for-my-research

24,"Well, if you are not a nice person when you are being honest, then I’m not going to accept you socially. Sorry. I just prefer to hang out with nice people. You should have no trouble finding other non-nice people to hang out with, though. (Come to think of it, dishonest people might work, too.

27,"I would ask you what’s wrong with striving to get along with more people (what you describe as “being nice all the time”)? “Being nice” is a behavior like any other behavior. Practice it enough and it becomes who you are. Look at children. Most of the time they are nice to each other when playing together. Children exercise thoughtfulness, kindness, practice sharing, and so on most of the time they interact with each other. Unfortunately, by the time children become adults their goodwill disappears. Most of the reason for that can be attributed to other learned behaviors such as selfishness, rI would ask you what’s wrong with striving to get along with more people (what you describe as “being nice all the time”)? “Being nice” is a behavior like any other behavior.

Children exercise thoughtfulness, kindness, practice sharing, and so on most of the time they interact with each other. Unfortunately, by the time children become adults their goodwill disappears. Most of the reason for that can be attributed to other learned behaviors such as selfishness, racism, religious intolerance, etc. These are negative behaviors taught to us as we grow, usually by the very people we trust to instill values in us.I am going to assume that the basis for your question lies in either religious intolerance or racism, or in a deeply held selfishness that you think should preclude having to treat other people with respect or dignity. I reach that conclusion by how you phrased your question — that a feeling of having to be nice goes against your grain and somehow justifies Trump’s ascension to the White House. I disagree. As I said, being nice is a behavior that causes you to change the more you practice it. But it is not exclusive from being honest. Any person can be honest with others AND be nice at the same time. I know this to be true. Honesty doesn’t require emotional brutality. One can always find more pleasant ways of expressing honesty without hostility. Adopting a pleasant attitude toward others can bring about major changes in one’s self, including appreciation and acceptance, and a deeper understanding of our fellow citizens. I suspect that people who have an aversion to the idea of being pleasant to others do so out of selfish reasons, or an unwillingness to give up some negative attribute, or a fear of being vulnerable. Get over it! Someone else is probably feeling the same about you. Be better than that. Then you won't have to try feeble arguments about political correctness to justify someone like Donald Trump.",UNKNOWN,Chris O'Leary,8K,4K,89.1M,https://www.quora.com/How-would-you-feel-if-I-told-you-that-electing-Trump-into-presidency-was-the-natural-consequence-of-too-much-political-correctness-where-the-emphasis-on-being-socially-acceptable-was-contingent-upon-being-nice-all

The issue with your premise is that Trump is by no means an honest person.I would however, agree with you that a high level of political correctness may be a reason that people voted for Trump, because they could not express the stress they feel in their daily lives in a comfortable, even if offensive, manner. The thing is,To elaborate, think back to just the 1990s. If some white man stressed from a day at work got mad in traffic and yelled the n-word at some black man, the people in the area may privately think of him as an jerk, and he may get into a fight with the black man, but that’d be the end of it. Today, however, the spectators will record it on their phones and post it on their preferred social media. If the employers of that white man catch wind of it, this man will certainly be fired.Everyone must now watch everything they say in any public setting at all times, no matter how stressed, tired, or drunk they are, because their jobs are on the line, but it has little to do with politics.This is particularly noticeable in colleges and universities, as they want to get many students just as any business wants many customers. However, compared to other businesses, the vast majority of their customer base consists of a much younger generation.I would agree that this trend is bad, because as society quickly chooses to suppress the use of the most insulting terms of foul language, there becomes less and less that could be viewed as offensive. It would be fine if it stopped there, but it hasn’t.The expectations of society have changed faster than many of the people, and this causes a lot of stress on those people.Enter Donald J. Trump. This man has let off all sorts of insults, threats, rude behaviour, and been the bully of the political world. He fearlessly charged into a society in which one wrong word can cause you to lose your job, and said all those words and statements that would get most people fired immediately in public on national television. He stood up to a society that was causing stress to millions, and won the Presidency.At this point the next question to ask is what should we do, if anything, about the spread of political correctness. What political correctness is attempting to do is remove all that is offensive from society to make society extremely polite. What this means is that the quest for political correctness will not stop for as long as we insult one another, whether it be intentionally or accidentally. I don’t think this quest for political correctness will ever stop or ever be won, because not all people can be rational actors all the time, and our technology to communicate is not going to go away. The only thing I can say is that we will have to live with it.What we can and need to do is ensure that political correctness does not censor factual and scientific information.On the most extreme areas ofOn the somewhat extreme areas of the right,We must put in place some way to determine, with the help of the scientific community and the media, what is and is not factual information. We must put in place protections for people speaking factual information. We must put in place some way to discourage people from attacking factual information. We must put in place some way to stop public figures from spreading misinformation.","55,922 followers",Jean-Marie Valheur,1.1K,3.4K,309.4M,https://www.quora.com/How-would-you-feel-if-I-told-you-that-electing-Trump-into-presidency-was-the-natural-consequence-of-too-much-political-correctness-where-the-emphasis-on-being-socially-acceptable-was-contingent-upon-being-nice-all

30,"I would disagree. The Canadians are politically correct, they are nice all of the time and they discourage racism and welcome Middle Eastern refugees to their shores. They elected Justin Trudeau, not Trump.What you are saying is that Trump’s election is a REACTION to political correctness by liberals on the part of Trump’s right wing base.
