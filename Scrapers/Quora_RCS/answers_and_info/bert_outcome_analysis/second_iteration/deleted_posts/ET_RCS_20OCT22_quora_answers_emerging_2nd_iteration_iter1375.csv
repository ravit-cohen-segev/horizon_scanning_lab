1,"For where I teach, the expectation is that I will reply to emails anywhere between 24–48 hours after a student sends the email unless it is on the weekend. This allows me to have some boundaries with work and to not be tied to my email accounts all the time.For replies to my emails, I tend to not have any expectations. Depending on how urgent the issue is, I will flag it for the students and put in the email that it is a time-sensitive matter. If they don’t reply, then they have to deal with the consequences of that. They are adults, presumably.",UNKNOWN,Shaad M.

3,"It depends on whom you ask. To be honest and unfortunately, all these titles and more are used interchangeably and recklessly by many employers in today’s market. Even worse, they can be used interchangeably by different teams within the same company.

If you pick random job descriptions from less popular employers or startups and try to find the distinction, you’d realize that there isn’t much!When I started my job as a Data Scientist with my current employer, there was another data scientist on the team whose job description was very different than mine. He was doing exactly what data analysts used to do at my previous employer’s. Then after 2 years, I switched teams within the same company. I joined a bigger team in a different department, and my role title switched to “Applied Researcher” like my peers in the new team, yet I am still doing pretty much the same tasks as with my previous team, which include developing ML models and pipelines, staying on top of the SOTA in research, publishing/patenting, etc.On the other hand, there seems to be some sort of consistency among the top employers in Tech. I am talking Google, Amazon, and Facebook. It is not 100% consistency, but at least there seems to be some sort of agreement on the minimum/maximum expectations for each of those roles. As I went through the discussions with many of my peers at those companies. I think I could summarize those roles as following, but first remember this isn’t a rule by any means and is not adopted by most employers:Data Engineers:Data Scientists:Research Scientists:Applied Scientists:Machine Learning Engineers:Hope this helps. But remember, not everyone agrees. the titles are used very subjectively in the industry. Don’t be surprised if you run into someone whose job title is something as fancy as “AI Genius”, yet all they do is googling how to add macro to an excel spreadsheet!",215 followers,Mike West,522,10.2K,55M,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-expectations-if-any-for-time-between-students-replies-to-professors-emails-professors-email-interpersonal-issues-academia

They are more connected with the business and the product leaders and are known as the trusted advisors. Their role involves data analysis, visualization, and knitting a coherent narrative, etc.Data Scientists often use SQL/Spark/Hive to extract and clean the data. They use Tableau/Power BI for data visualization and Python/R to run analysis. They might also build dashboards and data pipelines for recurring analysis.Applied ScientistsApplied scientists use Machine Learning to improve business outcomes by analyzing revenue, customer, cost, and experience. They build internal systems like product classification, fraud finding, or customer-facing systems like search, recommendations, etc. They will also develop internal datasets, tooling, and methodology like feature stores, package/docker templates, etc.Applied Scientists also uses Deep Learning libraries, and tools for containerization-Docker, orchestration- Airflow, CI/CD- Jenkins, and prototyping- FastAPI.They also provide solutions to the business problems just like Data Scientists. They also improve search and recommendations. They also help in building pipelines, experimentation, prototyping, training, deploying ML models, and DevOps. They also deliver code for Machine learning systems and documents on their design, methodology, and experiments.Research ScientistsResearch scientists are the reason for big advancements in Deep Learning, Computer Vision, and NLP. they investigate the problems with longer time horizons.They generally work on publicly available datasets. And other open sources available from Kaggle and other online resources.They have specialized knowledge in their niche. They are also good in literature research, reproducible experiments, and publishing papers at conferences and journals.Machine Learning EngineerMachine learning engineer’s role is to work on infrastructures and build platforms that make it easier to deploy machine learning models. They also work on application-based machine learning systems just like Applied Scientists.Most of them have past experience as software engineers because they should have a strong background in software development, and its best practices. They put emphasis on technical architecture and designing, security, scalability, etc. They use Java, Scala, C++ more than they use Python to solve the purposes.Data EngineerData Engineers are mainly responsible for maintaining and building an organization’s infrastructure, databases, data warehouses, and data pipelines. A typical Data Engineer transforms the data and formats it for useful analysis.They clean, organize, process, and store unstructured data. They use Saas platforms like CRM systems, email marketing tools to capture, cleanse, transform and route the data towards the destination systems so that it can be analyzed using analytics and business intelligence tools.By setting out the precise utilizations I think I have perfectly answered your question. However, there are several other factors that change the descriptions of the role from company to company. Hence you should be prepared for every job that is given to you once you join the company. You should always try to learn new skills.This is where Tutort Academy comes into the vicinityThey provide courses for working professionals in the field of Data Science, Machine learning, Artificial Intelligence for those who are willing to upskill their knowledge and want to take their careers to new heights. They provide three different courses depending on the years of experience you have and the knowledge that you lack in. They put high emphasis on the knowledge rather than just the certification.Some of their features areTip",34 followers,Bharvi Vyas,1K,70,1.8M,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-expectations-if-any-for-time-between-students-replies-to-professors-emails-professors-email-interpersonal-issues-academia
