And it did not matter whether you studied civil engineering or chemical engineering.

So what was the point of studying computer science?Soon enough, IT majors like TCS and Infosys started hiring lakhs from across all campuses across India, and I became even more convinced that software engineering was now a commodity. It was a ticket to a safe but mediocre career.But I was wrongSaying that you are a software engineer is like saying you are a writer. One could be JK Rowling or one could be an author of a blog, which nobody reads. Both are technically ‘writers’ but they are a world apart.So yes, we have an army of software engineers doing low skilled jobs at IT companies, which are surviving on the salary level differences between India and the US. But if that is all that was there to software engineering, why would Google and Facebook employ hordes of super-expensive software engineers in California?India has millions of software engineers, but where is all the innovation coming from? Has any major software language like Python, Ruby, Perl, or C been created by Indians? What about web frameworks like Rails or Django? What about libraries like Numpy or Pandas? I could go on and on.Even the US companies outsourcing work to our IT firms often get the critical work done locally by high-skilled programmers in the US. A lot of what gets outsourced is low-skill grunt work. I am obviously generalizing, but this is true for the most part.The story of software engineering in India is sadly much like our story in most other fields, be it sports, technology or business. At low and mid level skillset, we have an army of people. But at the high end of skillset, we are missing. Our best talent is sucked up by world’s top engineering schools and corporations.Back in India, many of our young graduates starting off as software engineers are only focused on constantly switching jobs to get that ‘30% pay hike’, rather than becoming really good at what they do. I have seen people from other countries make fun of how poor quality the code written by Indian engineers is, which should make us very sad.It is not that Indians are not competent. We have the same DNA as everybody else. My guess is that Indians probably constitute about 20% of the MS/PhD student population at many top US engineering schools. But back home excellence is not our priority - we settle for a low level equilibrium.It may sound harsh. But hiding from reality will not make it go away. It is hurtful, but we need to feel that pain and do something about it.What does the future hold for computer science?To foresee the future, let us look at the past. What has changed our lives the most in last 100 or 500 years? We still paint or draw or cook just as well or badly. For example, one could argue that the nawabs of Awadh ate better food than we do today.What has changed is technology. Everything we do is running on technology - from how we talk to people, how we travel, how we consume entertainment, to how we receive medical care from our doctors. And among all the areas of technology, software is the king.Software runs our lives 24x7, and it will do so more and more. The rockets launched by NASA or ISRO run on a ton of software. Our planes are sophisticated flying computers. When you fall ill, your blood testing is done by some fancy equipment, which is nothing but a computer at its core. Without software, your cars will not get manufactured, hospitals won’t run, and even your next-door restaurant won’t be able to bill you for food.The biggest companies in the world are de-facto software companies - Apple, Facebook, Amazon, Google… The industrial giants of yesterday are not in the same league anymore.The next 100 years will also belong to software. From data science to machine learning, from medicine to biotechnology - software will rule. And to win, you have to be at the cutting edge.The real game is not at the low end. It never was. The world is not very kind to the foot soldiers. Unfortunately, we live in a ‘If you are at the cutting edge of computer science, you will be the envy of the world. But if we keep switching jobs for that 30% salary hike, sooner or later we will get wiped out by someone with greater hunger for learning and passion for excellence. Make no mistake.Note: I have HUGE respect for people who build technology.

Most of the recommendations that you get to see are examples of what data science has. The capability of data science is too varied.By opting for Computer Science and Engineering and specializing in data science will broaden all your career aspects. Data science is transdisciplinary that uses algorithms, scientific methods, processes, systems to extract all the knowledge and information and insights from structured and unstructured data.And the requirement of application of that knowledge and information, including the actionable insights from data across a broad range of applications and their domains.Doing B. Tech in Data Science will broaden all your career aspects and give you a wide range to improve yourself for the coming future. Data science is of much importance in today's world. Data science brings together domain expertise from mathematics, statistics to create insights to make sense of data and programming. The Data sciences domain is very high and has a very great demand.Data science explains how digital data is transforming businesses and is helping them make much sharper and critical decisions. Therefore we can say that digital data is ubiquitous for those who want to work as a data scientist or data analyst.Data scientists have a massive role in business. They analyze all the data that is being generated and are also responsible for building software platforms and building data products.Some of the jobs that can be done after completing data science are:The data scientist explores many kinds of data patterns to measure the impacts that might force a change in an organization. Data scientists explain the importance of data in a much simpler method. They have statistical, mathematical and programming solving abilities in the different programming languages.Data analysts analyze data in a market to figure out the latest trends. Then, data analysts develop strategies to understand customer behaviour and their patterns and come out with marketing solutions.Data engineers are considered to work with the core of an organization. They are considered to be the backbone of that particular organization they are working in. They build, design and manage the database.A Business intelligence analyst analyzes all the collected data to maximize the efficiency of the company they are working in. This helps to generate more profit. Their role is more of technical nature.Marketing analysts assist the marketing division of the companies. For example, they analyze and suggest which product to produce in a heavy quantity and which product to be discarded immediately. In addition, they analyze the reviews of their customers and improve the company's products and services.Colleges from where data science can be done:Among these colleges,Data science has a vast scope, and all kinds of technology will depend on data science in the coming future.Therefore the answer to the question that is being posed is evident that doing B. Tech in data science is worth it.If a student has taken up computer science and engineering and specializes in the field of data science, then he is considered successful because much wide and broad range of choices will be coming his way.Besides, there will be lots of changes in the coming years, and hence the salary provided to the data scientists will be much higher.","23,270 followers",Michael Hochster,890,401,3.4M,https://www.quora.com/Is-it-worth-doing-btech-in-data-science

Tech in Data Science worth it is probably a question which is asked by many. Therefore to accurately remove your doubts and help you understand how Data Science works, let me help you build the idea by explaining from the very first.What is the term Data Science?Data Science is a versatile field that uses various scientific methods, processes, algorithms, insights from structured and unstructured data and systems to extract knowledge. This is done to apply all the knowledge and insights across a wide range of applications.Data Scientists are those people who are specialists in the field of Data Science. As the world is progressing more in digitalization, there comes a massive requirement for data scientists.Long years ago, as technology was still developing, whatever data gathered since then is not that much! However, if we were to collect the data two days from today, then the amount of data collected in the former's case versus the latter's case would sum more minor than the latter's. This is so because nowadays, the number of data and the quality they are being collected are much more than what was shared years ago!To sum up, doing a B. Tech in Data science is worth it. In the coming years, data exchange will weigh more than what the data scientists have got in their bags. Therefore, the need for a data scientist would be more as to the extraction of data, and the analytic process would be much smoother.This also proves that Data Science has a much greater job scope when it comes to technology.Jobs in Data Science:Colleges from where you can do B. Tech in Data Science are:Colleges play a vital role in reshaping our lives. They are the sole saviours of the students. In this hectic life, there is difficulty finding jobs; therefore, it is essentially required to get admissions in colleges that promise to provide suitable placement and good education.Some of these colleges are:Arya College Main Campus is one of the prominent colleges in Jaipur. The college has excellent faculty members for which the students have always found themselves excelling in academics. The placement process is flexible, and almost all students get placed in top-notch companies because of Arya College Main Campus.Vellore Institute of Technology is considered to be the top college among all the private colleges in India. The Vellore Institute of Technology is excellent in the field of Data Science and Computer Science Engineering. Also, the college is said to provide a very excellent atmosphere in Academics.SRM University is also one of the top colleges in South India. SRM has also managed rank among all engineering colleges. The placement facility that SRM provides is considered to be very good. Coming to the educational background, SRM manages to be one of the excellent colleges of academics. The students are well guided in the course of life as well.ConclusionThese are the top colleges from which one can get a good grasp of data science. Also, these colleges stand at the top of providing the best placement to the students in top-notch companies.Besides, the scope of data science in the coming years will be very high. The priority might also go to the data science engineers. The main job of a data scientist is to use search optimization skills and collect the data from them. The analysis and interpretation of data let them focus on the user's preferences.Big streaming platforms such as Netflix, Hulu, Voot, Amazon, Hotstar etc., have much more use of Data scientists and Analysts!

Your portfolio is as much forEverything isMy most practical advice is to remember that your identity does not belong to the companies you have worked for, or currently work for. It belongs to you. It’sOrganizations want people who know how to learn, know how to distill complex ideas down to their simple concepts, and know how to play their role on a team. Your portfolio should showcase these attributes in whatever capacity you currently have them. And trust me, you have them. Learn to speak in the positive, not the negative, and you’ll gain confidence in taking on more challenges and building yourself a better career.For the portfolio, obviously list any formal education, but also show your efforts for lifelong learning. These can be one-off courses, certifications, bootcamps, or a significant project you initiated. Work samples are any solution you contributed to while working on a team. You don’t need an employer to be part of a team; we are living in the information age. Submit a few pull requests on a Github project you find interesting, try to improve the top ranking solution on Kaggle, and get engaged with the community. As for your skills, they should be “test ready” when they are called upon. Can you sit down right now and show me how you move through the machine learning workflow?FrameData Gathering, Data Preparation, Model Building, Model Validation, and Model Deployment.A common mistake I see people make is they simply list the projects they have worked on. That tells me nothing. Did you gather and prepare data for that project? What tech did you use? What did you learn? Same for every other step of the machine learning workflow.A portfolio is just a snapshot of where you are currently in your career. Nobody has all the “right” education or background. Data Science is in its infancy so nobody can claim they are better prepared. But there are those who own their brand better than others and they are the ones who win.Nobody has to tell me to write about AI and machine learning. If I was alone on an island I’d still write for no audience because I know writing is a way to refine one’s thoughts. Nobody tells me to build endless web applications that run machine learning models, or to contribute to projects. Nobody has to tell me to promote myself or to brandish skills in front of employers because that’s the part of meYou’re already a walking portfolio, filled with passion and drive to help contribute to this exciting new thing we call Data Science. Just put it down on paper and own it.","20,165 followers",Sriraman Madhavan,11.7K,186,7.9M,https://www.quora.com/How-can-one-be-the-best-lawyer-in-India

Yes, having actual projects completed on the job or in a work setting are great. However, many of the skills and principles you are using in a work setting can be applied to your own personal projects.A common way that data science is used is in identifying a business problem, formulating a hypothesis or set of hypotheses, doing exploratory data analysis, identifying key features and then creating a model to perform predictions. This is an extremely summarized workflow but you get the picture.Once those steps are done, actually showing how a model can be implemented to drive value is key. In a business setting, you can have the best model in the world, but if it can’t be implemented or provide value it won’t be useful.Take the Iris dataset, for example. Almost every data scientist starts with this dataset and works their way up from there. Essentially, you’re trying to predict the flower type based on sepal width and sepal length. So you go through your data science workflow, and come up with an AUC of 0.85. You write-up your conclusions and that’s it. This is an example of a poor portfolio project, because you haven’t shown how it could be applied to drive value.Let’s say you use the same Iris dataset, but create your own story around. Let’s say that the company Flowers, Inc speculates on land with many different flower types, but can’t actually visit those sites for whatever reason. Additionally, let’s assume that each flower type (Setosa, Virginica, Versicolor) all sell for different price points and have different levels of profitability. The company has satellites that take pictures of different land throughout the world, and have systems in place that catalog the measurements of the flowers into a table. Your model takes that data and identifies the different types of flowers on that land. Additionally, this information is used to forecast additional revenue and profitability for each land parcel. Flowers, Inc can you use your model to maximize revenue and profitability, and only purchase land that will get them specific revenue and profitability growth rates.This made up examples is comedic, but I wanted to illustrate how building a project and adding it to your portfolio is as much about having the technical skills as it is being able to communicate a story about your data and showing how it can be applied to business problems. These types of skills are transferable to any industry where you find data scientists.",34 followers,Bharvi Vyas,1K,70,1.8M,https://www.quora.com/How-can-one-be-the-best-lawyer-in-India

Whether you are a fresher, freelancer, or a working professional, some validations proving your skills and expertise are required. You need to work on your portfolio more often. It should vary from company to company and role-specific. There are a few checklists that you should look into when you prepare a Data Science portfolio without job experience:Resources:Gather resources from wherever you can to make your basics clear. The person with the strongest base always stands out from the crowd. Start brushing up your basic data science concepts like Probability, Linear Algebra, Discrete Mathematics, Mathematical Modelling, and Logics. There are plenty of books, YouTube videos, and websites that can help build knowledge, which you will be confident in mentioning in your data science portfolio even without job experience.Certifications:You can enroll for Data Science Certifications provided by platforms like upGrad, Coursera, Udemy, etc. Not only this, look for the relative courses too. They’ll be of huge importance in your portfolio. Certification is the next thing that one looks for if you don’t have the experience. If you get one, that can just get you the job. The reason being, these courses upskill your knowledge to a great extent. The data science course designed by upGrad isn’t limited to just uplifting your domain skills, but you receive incredible support and guidance from the industry experts. And the biggest thing of all it makes you visible to the recruiters out there who are specifically looking for a job in the field of data science. Opting for courses where you are monitored all the time always gives you a fruitful output. Many times one can go wrong by adding certain elements in a portfolio that could serve no purpose. You shouldn’t look boastful but be aware of the prerequisites of Data Science. A Data Science portfolio without job experience may look patchy, but with proper guidance will give you evident information that’ll help you follow and achieve a proper analytical mindset.Networking:Always remember - ‘Network is net worth.’ If you think you are a person of value, you need to connect with people of value. Use Social Media platforms such as LinkedIn, Twitter that will truly help you to get great connections. You will be able to assess yourself by knowing their thought process, mentality, and the like. The field of data science grows and evolves every day. You need to be updated with everything related to it. Knowing about the requirement or what organizations are looking for really helps you tailor your portfolio. Additionally, if you sign up for the courses provided, especially by upGrad, you automatically connect with those who, just like you, seek the same thing in the domain of Data Science. Mentors and industry experts who have been a part of this whole system for a long time.Internships:Internships can be of great importance for a Data Science portfolio without job experience. Like certifications, internships give you an upper hand over as it does count in your experience. You look out for internship opportunities within your network. Platforms like upGrad help you connect with relevant companies looking for domain-specific roles. The projects you work on during that period will gain a lot of experience on how to deal with things and have a new perspective on data science. And even if you don’t get one, you can always explore your strengths and develop projects. Push your projects on open source platforms like GitHub.Lastly, don’t limit yourself to anything; work on data available from other projects too. Don’t overthink before investing in any paid courses; if you feel the contents could boost up your knowledge and skills, just do it.","23,270 followers",Michael Hochster,890,401,3.4M,https://www.quora.com/Is-it-worth-doing-btech-in-data-science

An end to end project will involve one or more datasets, exploratory data analysis, modeling and validation.

When you actually create your portfolio, you don’t want every project to use very common datasets like the Iris dataset. Any of the learning datasets are perfectly formatted and balanced, unlike datasets in the real world. When you are working through real datasets, you’ll be dealing with things like missing data, poorly formatted values and even incomplete data. Incorporating these elements into you projects will differentiate your skills from every other portfolio that uses perfectly massaged data.I would also recommend is being able to define the business or research problem that you are trying to solve for your project. In a business setting, for instance, you may start with one business problem, and as you’re going through your exploratory data analysis, figure out that you need to change your hypothesis. In your project, explain your thought process particularly if you start in one direction but then have to pivot based on the data you see. A real project won’t have a perfect hypothesis and follow all the data science steps linearly, and you may have to go back to your original data many times.Lastly, having a short summary of findings or insights is helpful as you are creating your portfolio. I’m going to make the assumption that you’ll be sharing your portfolio with other data scientists and hiring managers to get a job, and having this summary is key. In the business world, data scientists will be asked to present their findings to people that aren’t technical. If you try to tell a senior executive that your AUC is 0.91 and that you used K fold cross validation, their eyes will glaze over. However, if you can show how every 1% reduction in false positives will lead to a $1 million increase in sales, that is meaningful.",21 followers,William Chen,960,930,28.8M,https://www.quora.com/Is-it-worth-doing-btech-in-data-science

For example-So, how did the volume of a whiskey peg get associated with the name of a state in India?Well, Maharaja Bhupinder Singh of Patiala was known for his life of opulence. His extravagant parties, his eccentric wishes and his colourful persona was the talk of the town in those days (the early 1900s). The elites of Patiala, due to Maharaja’s regular parties, also got accustomed to the delight that was “whiskey”. As is the nature of the Patialas, they did everything king size, so they started drinking whiskey in copious amounts.The most awaited parties used to be the ones which were hosted for the British high ranking officials. Whenever the Patiala state was hosting one of the British empires’ dignitaries, the Maharaja made sure that only the finest quality whiskey was to be served.Now, during these parties, the nobles and elites of Patiala started overconsuming these whiskeys. This led to various embarrassing moments for the Maharaja. He laid a rule that no one from Patiala will be served more than 2 pegs of whiskey. Also, the thickness of the peg will be equal to the breadth of 2 fingers.The Patiala nobility was aghast. This minuscule amount of whiskey was not even sufficient to wet their throat. So, they brainstormed on how to circumvent this decree. One of the nobility whose IQ must have surpassed that of Einstein said that the decree does not mention which two fingers we have to use while measuring the size of the peg. Hence, they decided to use the index finger and little finger. The size of the peg became something like this-Thus, behold the Patiala peg!Cheers :)",133 followers,Vishal Rituraj,751,105,547.1K,https://www.quora.com/How-can-one-be-the-best-lawyer-in-India
