4,"I recently wrote a blog post that aims precisely to answer this question. Cross-posting here fromAs I mentioned inI recently wrote a blog post that aims precisely to answer this question. Cross-posting here fromAs I mentioned inAn interview is not a pop quiz. You should know what to expect going in, and you can take the time to prepare for it. During the interview phase of the process, your recruiter is on your side and can usually tell you what types of interviews you’ll have. Even if the recruiter is reluctant to share that, common practices in the industry are a good guide to what you’re likely to see.In this post, I’ll go over the types of data science interviews I’ve encountered, and offer my advice on how to prepare for them. Data science roles generally fall into two broad ares of focus: statistics and machine learning. I only applied to the latter category, so that’s the type of position discussed in this post. My experience is also limited to tech companies, so I can’t offer guidance for data science in finance, biotech, etc..Here are the types of interviews (or parts of interviews) I’ve come across.Always:Often:You will encounter a similar set of interviews for a machine learning software engineering position, though more of the questions will fall in the coding category.Coding (usually whiteboard)Prep tips:During the interview:Applied machine learningWhen answering this type of question, I’ve found it helpful to start by laying out the setup of the problem. What are the inputs? What are the labels you’re trying to predict? What machine learning algorithms could you run on the data? Sometimes the setup will be obvious from the question, but sometimes you’ll need to figure out how to define the problem. In the latter case, you’ll generally have a discussion with the interviewer about some plausible definitions (e.g., what does it mean for a user to “stop using the site”?).The main component of your answer will be feature engineering. There is nothing magical about brainstorming features. Think about what might be predictive of the variable you are trying to predict, and what information you would actually have available. I’ve found it helpful to give context around what I’m trying to capture, and to what extent the features I’m proposing reflect that information.For the sake of concreteness, here’s an example. Suppose Amazon is trying to figure out what books to recommend to you. (Note: I did not interview at Amazon, and have no idea what they actually ask in their interviews.) To predict what books you’re likely to buy, Amazon can look for books that are similar to your past Amazon purchases. But maybe some purchases were mistakes, and you vowed to never buy a book like that again. Well, Amazon knows how you’ve interacted with your Kindle books. If there’s a book you started but never finished, it might be a positive signal for general areas you’re interested in, but a negative signal for the particular author. Or maybe some categories of books deserve different treatment. For example, if a year ago you were buying books targeted at one-year-olds, Amazon could deduce that nowadays you’re looking for books for two-year-olds.  It’s easy to see how you can spend a while exploring the space between what you’d like to know and what you can actually find out.Your backgroundTo prepare:Culture fitYou may also get broad questions about what kinds of work you enjoy and what motivates you. It’s useful to have an answer ready, but there may not be a “right” answer the interviewer is looking for.Machine learning theoryYou don’t need to know a lot of machine learning algorithms, but you definitely need to understandDataset analysisI found these interviews hardest to prepare for, because the recruiter often wouldn’t tell me what format the data would be in, and what exactly I’d need to do with it. (For example, do I need to review Python’s csv import module? Should I look over the syntax for training a model in scikit-learn?) I also had one recruiter tell me I’d be analyzing “big data”, which was a bit intimidating (am I going to be working with distributed databases or something?) until I discovered at the interview that the “big data” set had all of 11,000 examples. I encourage you to push for as much info as possible about what you’ll actually be doing.If you plan to use Python, working through theStatsPreparation Checklist & Resources",UNKNOWN,Anonymous,593,0,0,https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-prepare-for-a-data-scientist-interview

You should be fairly comfortable talking about metrics, simple predictive models, and experimentation. Think with a quantitative approach to everything.Phone Interview - Coding QuestionsDuring the coding interview (which may be completely separate from your analytical interview), your interviewer will generally ask you to write some SQL queries. They'll present you a general schema, and you'll write increasingly more complex queries. If you don't know SQL, you can learn it at sqlzoo or some other online tutorial.Other companies will ask some simple programming questions. Be prepared to write some simple algorithmic programs - usually the interview questions will not ask a coding question involving data structures like linked lists, pointers, structs, etc., but trees, hash tables, and arrays are fair game.Note that SQL questions tend to be more common than other programming questions.

You were so interested in Civil Services for the last 05 years and why are you suddenly shifting to the Corporate sector now ? Are you after money? Don’t you want to do govt service anymore or work for the public, that you have advocated so much for half a decade?I have got a lot of accusations, of being money minded, this and that in the PMs in Quora.This is an answer to everyone, an answer which would describe my thought process in taking this particular decision.Before, starting with that, let us understand the structure of the Government’s Bureaucracy. That will help us have more clarity, in understanding my decision.The Government is divided into Levels, according to the 7th Central Pay Commission. There are totally 18 levels, with 03 entry points.Level 01 - 05 - Lower Services - Peons, Constables, Stenos, Clerks etc.Level 06 - 09 - Middle Services - Inspectors, Section Officers, DSPs, Block Officers etc.Level 10 - 18 - Upper Services - IAS, IPS, IRS, Undersecretary etc.Now, I have always aspired for the upper civil services, usually conducted by the UPSC, which deals with the upper management of the Government.This is where most of the “thinking” is done, this is where policies are “ideated” and this is where public policies are “drafted”.An IAS joins at Level 09 during training, and then starts off from Level 10, and has the possibility of having more than 07 promotions in his career of 35 years.This is where I wanted to be, join the bureaucracy, and then rise high enough to shape the policy-making. (Usually around Level 13 or so)Now, I have been working with the MHA for the last two years, at Level 07.This is the middle management services.This is where the policies which are “drafted” by the top echelons are “implemented” on-ground.Working in rural Bihar for the last 02 years, I have understood the exact ground realities, of where exactly it is going wrong, and how the policy drafting needs a bit change, by someone who has actual on-ground realistic experiences.But, a Level 07 employee can grow upto max of Level 10 or 11, where you start competing with junior IAS officers when you are about to retire. (Example Promoted SP vs IPS SP)So, in a span of 35 years, I will get only 3–5 promotions, and that too will be still stuck in middle management, and never reach the “ideation” and “policy-drafting” stages.So, how do I make a shift from “Policy Implementation” to “Policy Drafting” now? Which is where I really want to be.I am not able to clear the UPSC exam. I have tried.I am stuck in middle management, away from home, with an unstable life, mediocre salary, erratic transfers and postings, very few promotions and very slow career growth and strained personal relationships.If I get married to anyone soon, she would want to work in a city, which would again increase long distance and put more strain on the family.So, how do I make a shift from “Policy Implementation” to “Policy Drafting” considering all these factors?The answer came here - Lateral Entry from the Corporate - Lateral entry: Over 6,000 private sector specialists apply for 10 joint secretary posts in government [ https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/lateral-entry-over-6000-private-sector-specialists-apply-for-10-joint-secretary-posts-in-government/articleshow/65459546.cms ]And this privatization of the Government by bringing in external specialists is going to increase a lot in the next two decades or so.And they are getting Joint Secretary posts directly, which is a Level 15 post. A direct jump from Level 07 to Level 15, and if I stay I would retire by Level 10.I had to think.I had a plan.A long-term plan, with lots of risks and possibilities of failing.Get into the corporate sector.The lateral entry needs 15 years of total work-ex. I already have 05 years work-ex (Startup, Sabre and MHA)I need to work for 10 years, a decade in the corporate sector, after which I can make a shift to upper civil services - Level 15 in a very short time.And I have seen the 6000 applicants - Some are good, some are okay, not that stellar - I know my work ex in the Central Government in rural Bihar would stand out and would get a chance to interview for the Joint Secretary posts - This is 10 years later I am talking about - 2030 - When I am around 38 years old.So, how do I jump into the corporate sector?Some private job which deals with Public Policy or Development Consultancy or Social Impact or Public Administration jobs ?Also, I need a post-graduation, ensuring all the educational qualifications are in place.So, I made a list of colleges/schools/institutes which would ...","62,821 followers",Akand Sitra,2.9K,371,13.2M,https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-prepare-for-a-data-scientist-interview

For those who have never visited, it is one of two states on the island of Cyprus, located in the Eastern Mediterranean. Some days ago, I sat in the office of one of the media houses in the TRNC. We talked about a lot of things but there was one question that was asked: “How are international students enrolled in the universities across the Island?” The person asking me wanted to know how international students were catered for and managed on the Island. This article attempts to shed some light on the challenges of the process and how these issues can be managed better for Nigerians.For this article, we are travelling down to an international student’s home country (which range from over 80 countries across the world including Nigeria so feel free to pick one). While there are a lot of issues affecting international students on the island, not all originate from the island itself. A lot are aggravated and amplified by the poor state of affairs on the Island but actually start from the home country of the international student. So, I am going to ask you to become an international student for the rest of this article. Let’s begin.You are far more likely to hear about the TRNC from a friend or an “agent” than you are to see an Ad online or a brochure or a flyer. This friend or ""agent"" will be promising “cheap” school fees in a university in Europe. Universities in the TRNC typically use students enrolled in their schools as a marketing option to keep enrollments coming in year after year from their home countries in exchange for commissions. (These are the people we will call “agent” for the rest of this article). A prudent but also very dangerous strategy that has put several thousand lives at stake over the last 5 years due to how it has been implemented and managed. VOIS Cyprus (an NGO for international students) has repeatedly attempted to engage the government and several stakeholders on this issue but beyond a few words of sympathy, nothing really has been done. So, the problem persists.Back to you, you investigate and start asking questions about the TRNC. The “agent” tells you about this beautiful island with cheap fees whose universities who have work-study programs so you can get a job while in school and finally, about the low cost of living. Compared to what you might have been told about the United States, Canada and so other countries, this sounds like a dream, you might even sayNow, not all students take the time to verify a lot of these claims but you are diligent and intelligent. You want to do your research so you attempt to reach the universities mentioned in the flyer or by the agent online: via email and social media.Then you attempt to check google but the pages are littered with stories about the deaths of Nigerian students on the Island, some of which are even false according to your agent and he/she is right. Then, you check foreign affairs ministry and the immigration website but still none of them are able to provide up to date and relevant information to the questions you have. So, you turn back to your “agent” and it is clear that he/she is now your only source of information about the TRNC.Your “agent” paints your head with pictures and stories, maybe even sends you pictures and some videos and you start to fall in love with the Island. What you don’t realize is that your agent is doing all this (including lying and manipulating) to ensure that you come over to the island so that he/she can be paid a commission from his/her host university.Now, you are hooked on the cool-aid that is the well-seasoned blend of truth and deception from the admission agent, you pay your fees and begin to process your visa and travel documents.Your “agent” convinces you to pay for a dormitoryAfter you pay your fees, you notice a clause on your receipt.So, assuming all goes well, your visa comes through, you have paid your fees, you pay your “agent” his/her own fees (outside what the university is already paying), of course, you don’t know this and then comes your flight. News flash, your “agent” says you have to fly Turkish airlines even though there are more affordable options but because they are the most likely to get you to the TRNC. So, you put up with their horrible and sometimes racist customer service in spite of paying premium airfares. Finally, you arrive the TRNC.Let’s recap a few things: you think you have finished paying your fees (you haven’t), you assume you can/ will get a job, after-all you are smart and work hard (there are mostly no jobs, where they are, the employers mostly want to exploit you, working conditions/ hours don’t align with your school schedule, you sometimes have to choose between classes and work and even the citizens on the island struggle with unemployment) and you assume the cost of living is low. Well, it is except that accommodation is through the roof compared to your income, rent is sometimes collected in foreign exchange and some landlords are either looking to exploit you and/or not rent to you at all. Did I mention that “agents” also collect a commission from you equal to the cost of the rent? Yea, that and your deposit(s) collected by the landlord will only be refunded (whether in full or in part) at the landlord’s discretion even if everything is exactly the same way in the apartment when you move in.On top of all of this, you really have no idea how things work on the Island, your rights as an international student and/or the position of the TRNC constitution as it affects international students. So, you are stuck. You cannot afford decent accommodation, you cannot afford a flight ticket back home, you cannot afford the rest of your fees which also means you cannot get your resident permit done, all the money you’ve spent is now gone, the little you have left is barely enough and your agent is nowhere to be found, off to recruit the next set of international students. Perhaps, you too figure it as well to join the league of “agents” and concoct your own blend of lies and truths to get other students to come down to earn commissions to sustain you.Well, congratulations, you are now an international student in the TRNC. Ensure to join VOIS Cyprus because you will need them to survive on the Island, maybe even sooner than you think. Welcome to the TRNC.Now, what do I think is a solution to these things?1. Information and Enrollments:2. Accommodation:3. Working Conditions and running a business:The year is 2020, nobody (especially international students) should have to go through any of the above.

Annexation was not the goal. Oh, I am sure some Turks, including some politicians did dream of annexation, and “a greater Turkey”. However, for mainstream politicians, it was to protect ethnic Turks.There was a large international political backlash, and Turkey got sanctions imposed. Those sanctions hurt. They hurt a lot. The scarcity that followed is part of the reason why Erdogan is currently in power - he still (as of 2018) uses that we had to wait long lines for gasoline and LPG (for cooking) for years. He markets himself as the person who ended that.Turkey, not a rich country, got Northern Cyprus, a place without any natural resources, or even enough fresh water. We had to ship everything to make the place livable. Cyprus main (Turks call this Southern Cyprus) meanwhile joined the EU. The wealth gap between North and South Cyprus grew over time. South has almost twice the GDP per capita of Northern Cyprus at the moment.In 1990s, casinos got banned in Turkey. Someone had the bright idea to move them to Cyprus. This does provide income for Northern Cyprus, which is good I guess. However, it also turned Northern Cyprus into a place of debauchery. Think Vegas, with all the things Vegas offers. Vegas is fun, but is not really very suitable for a family life. A lot of Cypriots are not happy with this.So a lot of Turkish Cypriots actually understandably resent Turkey. Turkey has been managing the place for decades, failed to bring prosperity, did bring debauchery. They look across the border and see South Cyprus as full EU member, free to travel and work in EU.Logically, Turkey should let go of Cyprus. Turkey should have let of Cyprus probably in late 1980s. However, the politician who decides that will inevitably seen as letting go a place Turks fought for, and Turks live. No politician dares to face the loss of votes. So currently, Turkish politics pretend Cyprus does not exist.Annexation is really out of the question. That would put Cyprus into international highlight; with talk of sanctions again.",UNKNOWN,A.

Among other things, they “confirm[ed]…a predominance of liberal to left faculty on American college campuses.”While some of these are not surprising—few would consider the arts a bastion of conservatism—many of them are. Liberal professors heavily outnumber their conservative counterparts in business and economics, two disciplines that should (theoretically) be more amenable to conservative thinking.Most concerning here is that liberal political scientists outnumber their conservative counterparts by almost 40 to 1. In a discipline that purports to provide a neutral discussion of public policy, that looks really bad.More recent academic research has come to similar conclusions.A 2012 paper analyzing political affiliation among social psychologists found that a miniscule minority of social psychologists were conservative:A 2017 paper analyzing this issue at California State University “extend[ed] this research to…a wider variety of academic disciplines.” They found that liberals far outnumber conservatives, including in business departments:This is a major problem in academia, and not because they “might turn our kids into commie leftists.”First, it creates and perpetuates an intolerable form of discrimination among university faculty.Political “ideology is the second most powerful predictor” in determining the the quality of a professor’s institution. In other words, when controlling for all other factors, a conservative is going to have a harder time finding a job at a good institution than a liberal.“A small but growing literature in [political science] has found consistent evidence that political attitudes and behaviors are at least partially heritable.”Second, it harms the education of both liberal and conservative students.Conservative students at UNC are four times more likely to self-censor than liberals out of fear of retribution over their political views.When conservatives refuse to speak up in class, they lose out on learning valuable skills, like public speaking and communication within specialized disciplines.This is particularly important when discussing questions of opinion. When students hear the opposing viewpoint, they are developing tolerance towards people with whom they disagree.Furthermore, allowing students to debate helps students think rationally and clearly.An academic monoculture is also problematic outside the classroom.Academics write a lot of papers.Yet, it appears that academic monoculture has resulted in a marked decrease in quality among those academic papers.Let’s first look at a paper Professor Alan Sokal published a paper inBut if we want to look at some actual words from the paper, we can look at this gem (footnote omitted):We can see hints of it in the multidimensional and nonlinear logic of fuzzy systems theory; but this approach is still heavily marked by its origins in the crisis of late-capitalist production relations.Late-capitalist productions relations are not a thing. Nor is “the multidimensional and nonlinear logic of fuzzy systems theory.” The latter is merely a tool used to deal with “uncertain, ambiguous, and approximate information.”And that was the point.The entire paper was just made-up gobbledygook sent to a journal to see what would happen. This “daring and controversial leader in the field of cultural studies”And stuff like that continues to be published today.Take, for example, this 2017 article inNothing here (or anything else in the article) makes any sense. And it’s not supposed to. This, too, was another fake article full of made-up gobbledygook that got published.It’s fair to claim that these aren’t reputable journals. After all,But respected journals appear to be publishing this stuff, too.James Lindsay, Peter Boghossian, and Helen Pluckrose wrote a paper (under a pseudonym) entitled “Human Reactions to Rape Culture and Queer Performativity at Urban Dog Parks in Portland, Oregon” inThis, too, was fake.So, the liberal academic monoculture has now resulted in our scientific journals becoming intellectually suspect.We can’t have that. Policymakers use these studies to write legislation. Teachers use them to educate our youth. Scientists use them to write textbooks. These journals have to be the cutting edge of knowledge, and they have to be rigorous.And these journals are not.If we had more intellectual diversity in academia, none of these issues would exist. We wouldn’t have students scared to speak out. We wouldn’t have professors unfairly kept from achieving greatness in their fields. And we wouldn’t have poorly written papers become the cutting edge of knowledge.Relaxed. Researched.

The strain of anti-intellectualism has been a constant thread winding its way through our political and cultural life, nurtured by the false notion that democracy means that 'my ignorance is just as good as your knowledge.”When he stated this in 1980, there were still strong contingents of conservatives and liberals in both parties. But now that the GOP has become so strongly conservative and the Democratic party has become (only somewhat) more liberal in response, it seems to have become a matter of political dogma for conservatives that if liberals support a thing, then that thing must be wrong. In the eyes of conservative pundits, liberals are wrong about everything - absolutely everything. And when schools teach facts about science and history and religion and culture, the very notion that we liberals agree with those facts makes many conservatives oppose those facts…and oppose the teaching of those facts in our schools. And so they accuse our schools of being liberal.","68,119 followers",Abhishek Tr,4.6K,420,25M,https://www.quora.com/Where-you-surprised-when-you-arrived-in-northern-Cyprus-as-an-international-student
