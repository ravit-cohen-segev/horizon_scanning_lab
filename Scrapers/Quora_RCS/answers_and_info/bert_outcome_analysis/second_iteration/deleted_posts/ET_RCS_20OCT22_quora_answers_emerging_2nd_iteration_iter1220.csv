This post reviews 10 scientific studies in varied areas of life. Each study underscores how important communication skills are and highlights the surprising benefits of using communication skills effectively.My neighbor’s son just started his first year of college with a required course: Interpersonal Communication Skills 101.“Yeah, I’m sure it’s some b.s. class, but I have to take it, so…..whatever. What does communication skills even mean?” he remarked.And that’s a common view of the importance of communication skills. What student thinks it’s important enough to take seriously? I felt the same way when I was younger, until I read How to Win Friends and Influence People. Since then, I’ve never questioned the value of good communication.In modern corporations, communication skills are considered “soft science” which is not far removed from “pseudoscientific waste of time” given the lackluster attitude with which many employees approach the topic.To be fair, a lot of soft skills education is less than inspiring. When you consider the actual importance communication skills as evidenced by the wildly convincing studies below, you’d think mainstream educators would move beyond active listening and ‘I messages’.As a life coach training and NLP certification school, we’re raising the bar on communication skills education. Let’s make effective communication more than an emoji! Here are 10 solid reasons the underscore the importance of communication skills :The Importance of Communication Skills Demonstrated Through 10 Studies1. Better communicators have better marriagesResearch summary:According to a recent study, the number one cause for divorce is communication issues. John Gottman, who has conducted studies on relationships for over forty years at the University of Washington, came to the conclusion that the thing people struggle with the very most is effectively communicating with one another in a relationship.This validated information suggests that those who CAN effectively communicate in a relationship see more success and likely have a stronger connection to their spouse, which can be defined as having an overall better marriage.His research suggests that there are four types of communication problems that can lead to divorce: criticism of partners’ personality, contempt, defensiveness, and stonewalling (the refusal to communicate at all). The importance of communication skills is essential in a healthy relationship.References:Poor Communication Is The #1 Reason Couples Split Up: Survey | Huffington Post. (n.d.).

Curtis and presented at the Annual Meeting of the Speech Communication Association says that the most valued skills in the “contemporary job market” are communication skills. The study surveyed 1,000 personnel managers and came to this conclusion.This information suggests that the best skill we can invest in within ourselves is strong communication. If we can communicate extremely effectively, we will surely be able to land the job that will earn us the greatest amount of money.References:Why Communication is Important: A Rationale for the Centrality of the Study of Communication. (n.d.). Retrieved from3. Good communicators have higher self-esteemResearch summary:According to an article titled “Self-Esteem and Effective Communication Skills” published by Live Strong, studies suggest that people who are good communicators also tend to be mainly extroverted. The article says a 2001 study published in the “Journal of Research in Personality says,” extroverted people tend to have higher self-esteem. Extraversion can make it easier for people to approach strangers, talk in large groups and appear friendly. This can cause others to perceive extroverts more positively, potentially further boosting their self-esteem. People with low self-esteem may be anxious about talking to unfamiliar people and more uncomfortable in group settings.References:Self-Esteem & Effective Communication Skills |4. Build A Successful Family UnitResearch summary:A study conducted by Pearson, J. C. & Sessler, C. J. in May of 1991 titled “Family communication and health: Maintaining marital satisfaction and quality of life” which was presented at the Annual Meeting of the International Communication Association in Chicago says communicating role expectations is related to family satisfaction. Supporting, disclosing, negotiating, positively distorting, communicating needs, and demonstrating the understanding of other family members are just a few of the communicative behaviors crucial in creating a family which is healthy and happy.References:ERIC – Family Communication and Health: Maintaining Marital Satisfaction and Quality of Life., 1991-May-27.

Most Important Skill For People Entering The WorkforceResearch summary:The International Journal of Business Communication published a study in which 354 managers were asked to rank incompetencies when hiring new college graduates. The study findings suggest that the most desirable quality in a new hire is effective communication skills. Unfortunately, it is also the number one incompetency on the list, followed by lack of problem-solving skills and self-motivation.References:A Managerial Perspective: Oral Communication Competency Is Most Important for Business Students in the Workplace Jeanne D.

Helps People to Become More Critical of the MediaResearch summary:This study suggests that education of communication in the media can help people to stop and consider the sources, and evaluate the visual artistic messages being portrayed by the media source. According to the study findings, the second section [of this paper] explains how understanding society and institutions will help the individual viewer to create the necessary standards for the recognition and evaluation of moving images, particularly television images.

The Communicatory Ability to Speak Gives You the Tools to Participate in SocietyResearch summary:Students should learn to see reading and writing as vital support for the most direct way that citizens can express themselves and participate in public life—as public speakers. Public speaking was the primary medium for participation in public affairs at the birth of democracy in ancient Athens, and even today public dialogue or argument is, for most citizens, the chief means of participating in public life, according to a study, published by ERIC Digests titled “The Connections between Language Education and Civic Education”.References:The Connections between Language Education and Civic Education.

Good communication with parents determines child’s level of self-esteem, achievement, and better overall healthResearch summary:An article titled “Parent-Child Communication Programs” published by Advocates for Youth says studies show that young people who feel a lack of parental warmth, love or care were more likely to report emotional distress, school problems, drug use and sexual risk behaviors [3,4]. Young people also report less depression and anxiety when using CBD and more self-reliance and self-esteem than other peers who discuss sex with their parents.References:Schuster, M. M., Eastman, K.

It can give learners a voice that they may not have had before - George Couros.It is the era of computers and communication technology where computers and the Internet have entered every sphere of our life, from offices to residences, banks to post offices, small retail shops to big organizations, health care units to entertainment industries, etc., numerous important questions arise in one's mind regarding the ethical and legal use of information and communication technology (ICT).Ethics defines what is right for an individual and society and establishes the nature of duties that people owe to themselves and one another. All human beings could judge their action as morally acceptable, right or wrong. Even though ""good/right"" and ""bad/wrong"" does not mean the same thing for all, everyone has their version or notion of right and wrong. In an ideal world, the moral and legal action may mean the same, but they are not the same in the real world. Many acts that would be widely condemned as unethical are not prohibited by law and vice versa. Though it may be exaggerated and sceptical to say that there is no relation between ethics and law, the rule indicates practices rather than an absolute criterion valid for a particular place at a given time deemed socially acceptable, partly for moral reasons and methods.Every new technological invention has got both positive and negative impacts on our society. Albert Einstein had never expected that his discovery of nuclear power theory shall ever be used for devastating and destructing Hiroshima and Nagasaki. It was the same for communication technology, which also has so many alarming directions associated with it. For example, ICT provides easier and efficient means of storage and retrieval of information but, at the same time, suffers from piracy of copyright material such as software, data, music, video, etc., on a large scale. The Internet provides all sorts of useful information at the fingertips, but, at the same time, suffers from plagiarism, illegal uploading, downloading, copying, stealing, and misuse of intellectual property. Communication technology has made trade, investment, business simpler through e-commerce and online transactions but is affected by cybercrimes, forgery, sabotage, and loss. In other words, ICT has converted the whole world into a small intellectual village but, at the same time, has polluted it with horrid contents, like scams, worms, and viruses. Therefore, it is high time to carefully inspect the legal and ethical aspects of ICT as there are not enough provisions available in this field, as compared to those in conventional branches of science and technology, as ICT is not limited to the scientist and software engineers alone, it has become a widespread phenomenon, affecting people at every stage of their life. So, it becomes the moral responsibility of the people to decide how ICT can be best utilized.The integration trend of modern information technology in the process of education could not be avoided. We must admit that integrating technologies and computers in the education process has become an integral part of the education system. This trend has begun to expand in primary, secondary. Still, it has currently reached its boom in 2020 due to the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic, where online education became a blessing in disguise. This does not mean that learning in general as a social process that is realized through communications between the learner, teacher, and peers can be effectively replaced by technology. Instead, technology can enhance the education process in many ways, such as research, presentations, communications, collaborations, problem-solving, and creativity, which is the need of the hour. Nevertheless, ethics should not be neglected in any way, as a study of how to know what's right and what's wrong and as a mechanism that needs to be used conscientiously and continuously to maintain the direction, stability, and human society equilibrium. Therefore, the advantages and benefits we derive from ICT have the possibility of being abused by various users.The response to the question of how many students are informed about internet ethics is surprising. About 53% to 47% of the total internet users have little or no knowledge about internet ethics. Nearly half of the students who were declared as a massive user of the Internet do not have enough knowledge about the Internet's ethical use. It is a matter of concern, and this issue must be addressed more seriously.The use of technology has risen both in our schools, colleges and throughout society; hence, addressing technology's ethics is necessary. It is not new for our educational institution to preach ethics. Still, as education technology's use increased the complexity of the educators' task, schools can play a vital role in helping the children understand the values, policies, and laws applicable to the rapidly changing information technology-dependent world. The teachers or instructors must be aware of the importance of technology ethics-related issues. As it is rightly said, ""technology will not replace great teachers, but technology in the hands of great teachers can be transformational."" Hence, it is in the teachers' hands to ensure that the leaders and the decision-makers of tomorrow are well equipped to make the difficult ethical decisions they would undoubtedly face.","105,634 followers",Dave Consiglio,504,6.8K,91.4M,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-importance-of-communication-skills-in-community-development

I ""crashed"" on her couch many times.We traded books back and forth, and she was a sympathetic listener to my teenage  relationship narratives. The perspective of an adult woman was helpful in many ways. She certainly was my mentor, but while I was still a high school student (though no longer in her classes) it evolved into a friendship that was strong and meaningful to both of us but never showed signs of crossing the line into anything inappropriate.This was in the 1970s when social conventions were loosening up. Perhaps it could not have happened 10 years earlier or 20 years later without raising eyebrows. Our friendship was well-known to other teachers, friends, and both our families.After graduation we stayed in touch through letters and shared our poetry and publishing successes with each other. When I was in town she invited me for a meal or to join her writers group. When I got married at age 30 she came to my wedding and became a good friend of my wife as well.After 20 years away from the city I grew up in, we moved back and I renewed my close friendship with my old teacher.  She had divorced and remarried and she and her new husband socialized with us occasionally. By this time she was a college professor and I was a well-published poet. I was a frequent guest in her classes, we gave readings together, and also discovered we still enjoyed each other's company, so got together for a lunch or a dinner every few months, a pattern we've kept up for decades.When I was in my mid-40s she was struggling to get a book of poems organized, and I convinced her to let me help. It was mostly a case of getting her to release good poems and let them be published. For several weeks we got together daily. I also helped her find a publisher. Ultimately the book won some awards and helped her university career, and she has gone on to publish more books. She always was such a good poet.I've remained friends with her through the birth and growing up of her sons, and through her changing relationships. She is now single and has been for a few years, and I remain married and happy. She is now in her mid 60s and I am soon to be 60. Our friendship has always been just that, neither of us has ever had a romantic interest in the other. We care about each other, have lots of mutual respect, and enjoy each other's company. Life is complicated and relationships can certainly be very challenging, but real friendship, whether across an age or gender gap or not, is one of the best things in life.","26,836 followers",Lee Ballentine,3.5K,15.7K,52.7M,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-importance-of-communication-skills-in-community-development

It can only lead to problems, even if the visit or relationship is perfectly innocent.I learned about this from personal experience, and just 2 weeks ago. I was accused ofI recently left the high tech company at which I was CEO. Although I am getting involved with new business ventures, I consider myself semi-retired. To remain active and engaged (and to avoid getting underfoot at home), I offered my services as a substitute teacher in nearby communities. I began at the very end of the academic year (June 2014). But, my budding career as a substitute teacher blew up in my face after just one week—despite a slew of students and teachers who consider me the “best substitute ever”.Framingham is 15 miles west of Boston. After qualification by the public school district as a substitute teacher and submitting to a CORI background check, I was off and running. In just that first week, I became the favorite substitute for the district dispatcher. I was also barred from any contact with students—all within the 1st week of my assignments.My StoryOn my 6th day, I reported to an elementary school that was quickly becoming my favorite. I was assigned to cover for a grade 4 teacher who specifically requested me as substitute. Upon arriving at the building. an administrative assistant asked me to take a seat in the front office. She explained that someone from the district human resources office wished to talk with me directly and that she would be arriving shortly. In a few minutes, Raecia Catchings entered the office and ushered me into a side room. After receiving several accolades from staff and fan letters from students, I immodestly assumed it was to thank me for my service. Alas, my assumption was quite wrong!...BackgroundOn the previous day, I was a substitute at Walsh Middle School in Framingham MA. That evening a middle school student wrote to me and asked a question. It was a completely innocent question about a card trick that I showed to the class as they were filing into the room. I told them that if they behaved and if we covered the day’s work, I would explain the trick at the end of the period. As the period ended, we barely completed the academic tasks at hand. That’s because I strive to complete both the classroom teacher’s work and also add material of my own. (In this case, it was a 7th grade Social Studies class, and I added a quick PowerPoint presentation on Operation Mincemeat during WW2).Several students complained that I had not left sufficient time to explain the card trick. They were already being paged to their buses. And so, I placed an email address on the white board and offered to send an explanation or link to anyone who wanted the information.Later that evening, one student wrote and asked for an explanation of the card trick. I replied, of course. I will leave her name out of this story. I suspect that she would be mortified to learn that the school fired me, and sought to cast my reply as if I were a sexual predator. In fact, my reply was limited to an explanation of the trick. I added the words, “Have a good summer vacation”, because I did not expect any further contact with that student.But on the next morning, as I sat in front of Ms. Catchings, she informed me that I was being dropped from the teachers pool, because my reply to that student constituted “inappropriate contact” and was a violation of the substitute teacher policy handbook. As I was rushed out the door like a criminal. I was informed that I was prohibited from contacting any student, teacher or staff member other than the Ms. Catchings.I pointed out that my email was a response and that the student wrote to me first. Ms. Catchings replied with dryness and disdainThe interesting thing, in this case, is that I met with Walsh school principal, Teressa Carney, on the same morning. She provided me with the Walsh Middle School Substitute Teacher’s Manual (2013-2014), which I have placed here:The manual neither restricts nor discourages offering students a contact address. What baffles me in this entire affair is that a permanent staff member was in the room with me when a student approached and asked if she could erase and re-write my email address, so that it was more easily visible to the few people left in the room. The permanent staff member had no problem with the email address on the whiteboard. In fact, she loved the card trick and specifically its use as a classroom management tool to encourage good behavior.…But there’s another problem—one far more ominous: In a formal letter handed to me by Ms. Raecia Catchings and signed by Superitendent, Stacy L. Scott, I was informed that because of my “inappropriate contact”, I would beI occasionally lecture at colleges. In fact, in just the past month (May 2014), I was guest speaker at University of Montreal. (Ref:Changing Mores: Inappropriate ContactTo be fair, my 13 year old daughter (also in grade 7) tells me that it would be unusual for a substitute teacher to provide students with an email address, even for follow up to an assignment. She explained to me that elementary and secondary schools use academic networks administered by the school for most electronic contact. Dumb me! I get it…We live in a litigious age and it is becoming the norm for schools to foist nanny cams on student communications, even with teachers who are scrutinized and vetted. Forgive me, Ms. Catchings. I was not informed of the new rules. It certainly is not in the teacher’s manual.So where does this leave me? Not at all in a dither. I have a thick skin and I am not easily scared by fear mongers, and I have already heard through the grapevine that I have the support of nearly everyone with whom I came into contact. Since I am now teaching in the same town, I have taken a proactive approach with the new administrators, by explaining the actions of the public school district (as if anyone can explain irrational behavior). At this point, my only concern, is that my local police department may have flawed and absurd data which could result in blocking a future background check.That’s my story, but it is not complete. Because of the potential for future harm to my reputation and my career, I am now seeking legal advice and I plan to push the town of Framingham to confront its methods and apologize to the teacher who requested my services, and to the student who wrote to me. One might think that my chances of success are slim to none. But don’t count me out! I have a reputation for exposing excess and encouraging fair resolutions. Perhaps, one day, I shall return to this Quora forum and update the story.So should you pursue that relationship with your teacher or student? Probably not. The days when a teacher could reasonably take a student to the museum or confer over coffee at the donut shop have ended. On this point, many agree. But should you shy away from all contact because you fear the titillating interpretations of the Ms. Catchings in your district? Clearly, you should abide by the policy manual that applies to your employment. But in the absence of a policy that contradicts your common sense (Framingham does not have a no-email policy) then don’t live in fear of authoritarian policy wonks.The Catchings of this world convolute the education process by suppressing the free exchange of ideas, and the thrill of education. In my case, I suspect that the principal, the student and the parents each privately support my position, even if their conscience is tied up by fear of lawyers, other parents, or the tin plated enforcers of mediocrity.~Ellery",36 followers,Christine Pietersen,3.1K,0,0,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-importance-of-communication-skills-in-community-development

It doesn't mean they aren't good teachers - I know some who completely mediocre in school but do great work in the role of teachers - but if I'm getting into a really thought provoking conversation of some aspect of our society beyond teaching, it's pretty much always going to come in a conversation with a student who has already thought more about this than the other teachers.So I'm supposed to think of these humans as ""not fully grown adults"" when they've already surpassed many of the teachers? This seems not only unrealistic but a recipe for the classic ""smart kid burnout"" that's pretty rampant in schools. When I interact with these kids after class and treat them like their intellect warrants, they light up and it's not uncommon to see their grades shoot up accordingly, so stopping just doesn't seem an option.I'll pivot to actually answer the question then:Yeah, clearly being too friendly with students is seen as ""creepy"" at times. In general I doubt this is often perceived this way when the relationships are of the same gender, but when they cross-gender look out. Of course this is interesting because we all know that homosexuality exists, and there are proven dangers on that front with authority figures of minors, but I doubt it's perceived as ""creepy"" in most cases.The perception, along with the reality that an adult intellect does not mean adult emotions, is reason to be very careful when interacting with your students. However when I teacher's going completely the other way - no interaction with students after class - there are real problems associated with that as well. Being the best teacher you can means striking balances on many fronts, and this is one of them. It may be simplest to just hide in the teacher's lounge during lunch, but that's not what provides the optimal education.",325 followers,Kenneth Durham,4.2K,1.9K,2.5M,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-importance-of-communication-skills-in-community-development

Perhaps the best teacher at the elite private boarding school where I taught regularly invited students to cook dinner with him at his apartment.I think no one considered this ""creepy"" in South Korea -- so perhaps the fearfulness is an American disease.",0 followers,Mayank Sinha,22.8K,0,0,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-importance-of-communication-skills-in-community-development

I once had a girl in my class, she was about 15 years old, and she decided the first day of the new school year that she hated me. After 4 weeks of class, she suddenly walks up to me in the middle of me talking about the outbreak of WW1 and started saying things about my family; she knew my youngest sister’s name, address, where she went to school and named some of her friends. While doing this she kept looking straight at me. When she finished summing up all this information, she turned around, walked back to her chair and smirked at me. I was completely freaked out, but kept a straight face and went on with my class. After this class I immediately went to the principals office and demanded that her parents would be called into school to discuss this ‘intimidating’ behaviour. It was brushed off as a joke by them.Few weeks later two of her friends were still in my classroom after class so I started chatting with them. They brought up the incident that occurred and told me that she was out to get me and my family because her boyfriend liked me. Now this wasn’t just a ‘normal’ jealous teenage girl, she regularly got into very violent fights and was known for being completely bonkers. Her friends feeling the need to inform me of this and telling me to be careful really freaked me out again, I don’t want a crazy person like this knowing my family’s address! Back to the principal’s office is was. The parents were called again and she was suspended from my classes for the rest of the block.I had to teach this girl for another 2 years, she never said anything inappropriate to me again, but it’s the only student ever that I didn’t want to have in my classroom.","358,193 followers",Sean Kernan,11.1K,5.6K,723.6M,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-importance-of-communication-skills-in-community-development

Even though he was much younger than my parents he had always felt like a father figure to me. He told us we could write, and throughout the years I did. Twelve years ago I was back East with my 3-year-old son and asked if I could visit him and his wife. Twenty-four years melted away and the rapport between the four of us was strong. Since then my son and I have gotten together with them several times, and it always feels like a celebration because we have so much in common.Three wonderful friendships, two of the cross-gender, and nothing ""creepy."" I'm glad to have grown up in a time when this was possible.Since then I've gone on to teach  high school and middle school. Mostly I've taught in a public district where students feel free to express their emotions to teachers, and where it's possible to see one another as people. One year, though, I taught in a school where we teachers were constantly being told to keep the door open and never be ""alone"" with students and never to touch them. This was to ""protect"" us. It felt unnatural, and the environment was colder than what I was used to.I think it might still be possible for high school students and teachers to be friends, but I think it would be important to communicate using school e-mail and hold off on meeting outside of school until the student has graduated.","29,335 followers",ER Mikulincer,3.4K,17K,64.2M,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-ethics-in-technology
20,"In the early to mid-80s, when I was in high school, I was ""friends"" with a teacher. I put the word in quotes because it was in no way a real friendship.

She had a long-time fiancé, and she was probably manipulating him as well.But I was only one in a line of such students. Each year, it seemed, she chose a senior from among her students, one that she had sort of ""groomed"" for the ""position"" over the previous three years of school. Every year, there were whispers of ""something going on"" between her and her chosen student.Perhaps her most egregious action was to tell me, during the intermission of a school musical in which I was playing the lead, that she would no longer be my friend. I don't recall the ""reasons,"" but it completely disrupted my concentration and performance after the intermission. (In some ways, it might have actually made it better, but that's an answer to a different question.)A few other teachers knew of my problems with this person (and considered her something of a crazy person, or so I gathered), and they seemed to think it was unfortunate but not inappropriate. One of them, as I recall, found the whole thing, and my overly emotional adolescent reaction to it, very amusing. ""Why do you let her get under your skin?"" he would ask. From my current perspective, these seem odd reactions, but perhaps nobody wanted to point fingers. (Or perhaps, as we are so often reminded on Facebook, people who grew up in the 70s didn't wear bike helmets, etc., etc., and came out OK, and this is just another example of that attitude.)As I noted, my parents had suspicions but never mentioned them, and when I later found out, and asked why they never said anything, they said they didn't want to make accusations and figured I would talk to them if I needed to. It probably would have been helpful if they had confronted me, but that, too, is probably the answer to a different question.The year I graduated was her last at the school. The next year, I returned to the school as an alumnus to help with the school musical. The school at the time did a matinee performance during the school day that was attended by students from neighboring schools. One of my assigned tasks was to meet each bus and take the students and their chaperones to their seats.When she arrived on the bus with students from her new school, and I met the bus, she refused to get off the bus until I went away, shrieking ""Keep him away from me!"" She also came to see the show again on a performance night, and on this occasion, her fiancé greeted me with ""Hey, dickhead.""That was the last time I saw her, and I was happy for that. My fellow alumni occasionally talk about tracking her down and inviting her to some sort of reunion. Needless to say, perhaps, I have little interest in that.All of this is to say that while I think it's perfectly possible for relationships between students and teachers toit is not normal for adults to look for the emotional support of a friendship with a person who is not a fully grown adult.I would agree with that statement. I think that the reverse is completely natural, and I also think that after the student leaves school and becomes an adult, that relationship is free to become whatever it will be. But while there is an imbalance of power and maturity, it's up to the teacher to maintain boundaries.",991 followers,Omkar Nawlakhe,12.2K,53,3.3M,https://www.quora.com/Is-it-often-considered-creepy-if-a-teacher-becomes-close-friends-with-their-students-if-it-isnt-sexual-at-all
