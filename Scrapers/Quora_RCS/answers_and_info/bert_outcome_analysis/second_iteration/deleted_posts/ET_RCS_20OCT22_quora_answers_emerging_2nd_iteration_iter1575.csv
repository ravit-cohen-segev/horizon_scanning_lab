Keep in mind, this was in the late '90s, when the job market was white hot and much less competitive across virtually all fields.Before delving into this list, let me say something briefly about IR and other fields in the humanities and social sciences - you can't do anything with them, which actually means you could do many, many things with them. Did you study accounting? Great, go be an accountant.

Did you study accounting? Great, go be an accountant. Engineering? Great, go be an engineer. Got a BA in something? There's no set and defined job waiting for you, but there's a lot of possibilities. Here's where some of my peeps ended up soon after graduation:You get the idea. Some of those jobs sound really exciting and glamorous, most were the typical entry-level, pay-your-dues type gigs you should expect in your 20s. Granted, it was the right place at the right time, (DC in the late 1990s,) but there was 'nothing' they could do with their degree, and therefore there was a lot they could do with it.Some folks realized they'd need a graduate degree to really excel in an IR career, others stayed in the field and did just fine without one. Quite a few, like myself, drifted away from international-work, but found the insights gained from their education invaluable in an increasingly inter-connected and diverse world.

1,"I hope this answer doesn’t come too late, because I beg to differ with those around you and from fellow Quorans.Truly, IR relevance and career opportunities depend on how passionate you are about it, and how much hard work you’re willing to put. I studied IR, worked in IR for a bit, and gave up when living in a dangerous place wore me off.A bit of context: I come from Italy, BS in foreign languages (Spanish, English, Portuguese), and MSc in IR . My Master program was limited to 40 seats, strongly international, English-taught, and offered plenty bilateral agreements with foreign universities.I hope this answer doesn’t come too late, because I beg to differ with those around you and from fellow Quorans.Truly, IR relevance and career opportunities depend on how passionate you are about it, and how much hard work you’re willing to put.

My Master program was limited to 40 seats, strongly international, English-taught, and offered plenty bilateral agreements with foreign universities. I enrolled IR because, naïve as I was, I wanted to change the world. Also, I didn’t want to do so through the UN, the EU parliament or any formal institution. I wanted to go grass-root.I was (and am) in love with Latin America, and wanted to start from there. So I applied for all relevant scholarships, and managed to spend 6 months learning south American politics in Chile, and other 4 working for a local development bank in Brazil. Honestly, it was the best time of my life, but working inHowever, of the 40 people that studied with me: 1 works with the UN in Brazil, and one worked with the UN in the US, 1 for the FAO in Rome, 1 for the institution against the use of nuclear weapons in Europe, two are working in project management in Africa, and one even created his own NGO. These were the people that busted their asses off, creating connections at every opportunity, graduating in time and with honors, and willing to be deployed anywhere to start. I was a mediocre student at best, and my motivations were a tiny bit stronger than dreams I developed reading too many adventure books. :)If your heart is there and your willingness is too, you’ll do great things. South East Asia has plenty body and organisms looking for bright minds on a rolling basis. Good luck.",UNKNOWN,James M.
