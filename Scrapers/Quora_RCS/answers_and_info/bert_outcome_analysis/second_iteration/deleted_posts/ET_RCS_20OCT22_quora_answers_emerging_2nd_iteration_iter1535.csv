Gave a lot of interviews and failed all of them. Initially I was frustrated but later realized that I was good for nothing.2. Started working on some websites, some worked, then failed and then I was back to my job search.3. Watched lots of english movies, prison break and played a lot of games.4.

Used to wakeup at 11 in morning and slept at 3 AM.5. Lost all my friends, be it from college or from school. Was in touch with only one from college and two from school where I had6. Friends or should I say ""so called friends"" showed their true colors. Whenever I used to go for an interview, I used to call all my college friends about that opening. Later I found out that I was the only one among my friends who was doing it.7. One of my so called best friend whom I used to inform about all the job openings and was in continuous touch with got a job. Now the sad part was that I got to know this news after 1 week through some other friend where I was in constant touch with my best friend. I called him that day to congratulate.8. Was a disgrace to my parents. They were ashamed of me. Hell even I was ashamed of myself.9. Locked myself in house. Was not seen outside for months.10. Whenever I used to do some work on my website my dad used to think that I was playing video games/watching movies. I don’t blame him as he had every right to think that way.11. Relatives were having the best time of their lives as I was a treat to them. Now I am very thankful to them as my patience level has reached infinite level because of them.12. Got to know the ultimate truth of life i.e. ""Nobody gives a fuck about you or your life except your parents. They are the ones who will be always there for you.""13. Never attended any party or family function no matter how much necessary it was. I even missed my 1st cousin’s wedding.14. I was very active in extra curricular activities during my college days. In my final year I was the president of my college and organized a no. of college events. I was a very confident guy when I completed my B.Tech in 2010. In 2013 I was the most fragile person you could have seen in your life. 3 Years changed my life and attitude upside down.And then finally landed with a job in 2013. Now getting that job is story for some other day.People say that it is the worst time phrase of any Engineer's life. But I believe that it is the best thing ever happened to me. It made me the man I am today. Now I value my job because I know it is not something which is available easily. Now I know how to differentiate between Friends and Real Friends. And most importantly I know the importance of family.So I will say that a jobless engineer goes through the worst phase of his life which later turns out to be the best phase of his life.Some friendly advice for all who are going through the same:Some friendly advice for all who are going through the same:1. It is just time and it will pass.2. Start working on your technical and speaking skills. That is the only reason you are still without job. For speaking skills start watching English movies/serials with subtitles. For technical skills checkout the job postings, list out the key skills required by recruiters and start your preparation for those skills. As a fresher nobody expect you to be a pro on any given skill yet you must have basic knowledge.3. Keep yourself busy. Do some workout/jogging or both. Also start doing some freelancing or online job. It will keep you busy and obviously you will earn some money.4. Most important: If you are staying at a place which is at some distance from the city you are going for interviews, shift immediately.5. Learn to give answers to useless fellows (eg. relatives, neighbors, friends etc.) who are more concerned about your job then you are.6. Your parents will say a lot of things which they don’t mean actually. Never ever in your life disrespect them. They are the ones who have spend their hard earned money on you. Learn to listen as they are the only ones who really care about you.And last one you are the one responsible for this situation and you are the one who will have to work your way out of it. Don’t blame anybody else for your failure. Work hard, prove yourself and get out of this situation.",4 followers,Rahul Mohan Verma,2K,0,0,https://www.quora.com/How-is-the-life-of-a-jobless-student-after-the-completion-of-their-engineering-degree

I have been rejected 35 times - They all felt the same thing -Every day parents, relatives and neighbours compare me with others saying things like - “that boy got a seat in a mediocre college but yet he has a job and you are here at home doing nothing - what’s wrong with you ,what will our relatives and neighbours think of you? “. I once overheard a noisy neighbour talk to another neighbour saying that I am in this situation because of drugs.(I never smoke nor drink let alone do drugs)Fast forward to 3–4 months after graduation.Depression set in . I would lock myself in my room and would cry endlessly. Insomnia took over and I could barely sleep .In 2 years and counting , I have experienced living hell and often dabbled with suicidal thoughts not knowing what tomorrow has to offer.This is what an unemployed engineer with decent grades from a good college has to endure !UPDATEUPDATE :I am so very sorry to inform you all that my dear friend Anirban who is the author of this post passed away after a brief illness.He put up a brave fight till the very end not losing hope.Even in his last days,he was cracking jokes to lighten the mood.I am devastated and utterly shattered to have lost my good friend of 15 years . Even while typing this final update to this post,I am unable to hold back tears.All I can think of is his smile and happy memories that we shared.Even in times when he was facing issues in his career and health,he would always enquire about my well-being and for the last 12 years or so,he was the first person to wish me on my birthday.I feel like I have lost a part of me.What a great soul!Anirban,you will live on in our hearts forever and your voice will forever echo in our minds.Goodbye pal!",1 follower,Anirban Ray,3.7K,0,0,https://www.quora.com/How-is-the-life-of-a-jobless-student-after-the-completion-of-their-engineering-degree

I just left that place (I used to stay near the automotive plant in the very outskirts of western bombay) and came back home!I applied for masters with my scores which I already had obtained in my final year. So, I am unemployed for almost more than 7 months. And this period seems small but for a student with good co-curricular projects, technical aptitude, decent marks and from a very good college, being unplaced and landing up in a shitty job while my friends worked in top companies, and then spending 9 broken months all alone was a nightmare until I start my masters! And the overburdening thought of what I will answer when asked for the account of this period was again creating a hole in my brain.But actually it turned out to be a blessing in disguise. And I want everyone else to spend their unemployed phase of their life working onSo, my feelings in the initial few months.Next comes,Deep down, we all want the world to be fair. But this isn’t the case. And knowing this can be liberating.You’re not doomed to suffering.And if you follow this one simple fact,The unemployment phase of mine might seem small but it was actually very long for me with two of my best friends, my support system, being extremely busy and away from me in this phase. And though I had something to be done in a year, but most of my colleagues were managing this with job too (another burn). Also, the friends in my colony are a couple of years older than I am, I being the youngest (22) and they talking about savings and all was an ache.And huge respect for others who endured such a long tenure and I am sure the emotional strength which you guys have is unbeatable and it will help a lot and would be responsible for your success!Edit: I couldn’t beEdit 2:Nitant Pandey's answer to What are some great non-fiction books a 20-year-old should add to his library?Thanks a lot for such kind words and support, frankly I never expected this answer to be so acknowledged.

Had few Backlogs and it is also the reason why I wasn’t even eligible to sit for Campus placements.1st Phase: Confessed in front of parents on what happened in my engineering days, how I failed in subjects, how I procrastinated, depressed, low self esteem,zero confidence,no aim in life. It was the most hardest and painful time of my life.[My parents were so proud when I cracked AIEEE and got in good college, they were confirmed that I would placed in Good company and life would all be good]Hearing all this brouECE Graduate.College: One among the Top 15.Cgpa: 6.1Graduated a year later in 2015. Had few Backlogs and it is also the reason why I wasn’t even eligible to sit for Campus placements.1st Phase: Confessed in front of parents on what happened in my engineering days, how I failed in subjects, how I procrastinated, depressed, low self esteem,zero confidence,no aim in life. It was the most hardest and painful time of my life.[My parents were so proud when I cracked AIEEE and got in good college, they were confirmed that I would placed in Good company and life would all be good]Hearing all this brought tears into their eyes and my eyes. Then came the Guilt feelings, clouds of sadness. My parents, they shouted at me for sometime and then understood my situation, started supporting me in all ways.2nd Phase:My Father is very stable and calm person, he advised me to join him in the mornings for Running, so I started running, doing exercises but the rest of the day my mind used to think only about the past failures, regrets, guilt and what not. It’s like nothing good left in my brain, everything was negative for me.Then I came to know the chances of getting placed in core companies are very less, because they recruit mainly through campus placements or outside campus they ask for experiences.They need skills, projects, vast and good depth of understanding of subjects.I gave Gate 2014 (Qualified with 30+ marks, but I was not graduated yet), gave it a try without any preparation in 2015 (Not even qualified).And something wonderful thing happened one day,when I saw my degree which was awarded to me, it brought happiness and big smile to my face. My mind went back to all those memories, how I used to spend my summer holidays staying with few friends in college preparing for back exams, clearing few subjects in more than 2 attempts [Also at one time I had 10+ backlogs but i never gave up, because I knew I was better than that].so much of extra hard, painful work for this degree certificate.So, I thought why not an ME in future or cracking ESE and other PSU exams. But I didn’t have enough knowledge on the basics and advanced stuff. So, I joined coaching institute for GATE,ESE-2016.I chose my core field because it is interesting and I don’t have any other talents on which I could make a living. Also Engineering was something which I failed for the first time in my life,so in way I want to improve and conquer my failures.3rd phase:I kept the negative thoughts, sad feelings, guilt as far as possible. I just ignored those feelings, that is how one removes negativity. Every morning like medicine I used to watch motivational videos, answers on quora, people experiences who turned their life from worst to best. One particular movie helped me a lot, it was PEACEFUL WARRIOR.During preparation I lacked consistency, understanding of some concepts, still little low self confidence, lack of proper study and remembering techniques, not enough time for revision led me to 4 digit rank in GATE 2016, also my ESE 2016 conventional didn’t go well.4th phase:I was sad and didn’t left my room for 2–3 days then dusted myself and started my preparations for few PSU’s in coming months. I am positive that i will eventually crack exams.Gave up few things which are not important in life and made few habits like running in the morning, soaking in sunlight for Vitamin D, exercise in the evening, meditation.So,I sometimes have sad days, on some other days I work hard, some days I feel motivated and some days not, but I know one day I will make it out and I will achieve my dreams. My parents are still supporting me as much as they can. I am so lucky to have gotten such wonderful parents.Also started learning programming, following some awesome people [experienced in Electronics field] in here on quora, their answers help out a lot, learning about practical skills, job requirements, etc.,learning to design basic electronic circuits.It’s not who you are, but things you do that defines you.The struggle is going on and I ain’t giving up.Edit: It’s been almost 7 months since I wrote this answer. I usually used to visit quora and read my own answer to motivate myself, try even harder, and also encouraging comments from wonderful people in here would boost me and brighten up my face with a smile.Finally in december, I got notification from BSNL on selection for JE post, and few days back my document Verification was also done. So, finally on my way to being Employed.I feel content for now, my parents too are happy, they still want more from me, to see their son in even a better Job profile(Mostly Group A services). Even, I too think the same but, I haven’t planned anything for now. I just want to breathe in some air, do those small fun things which I missed in past year and half time.Enjoy my Job, life and with time, experiences when I would become ready then, I will plan further new ventures ahead.Thank you so much for all the kind words, wishes, support and upvotes, may all your dreams & wishes come true.

So this company is just 800 people strong, so since its a fairly small company they take in freshers in batches. When the joining dates came in, I was given September 2015 and was in the third batch which was the last one.The first batch - July, Second batch- August.I was happy because I had 3 months of buffer after exams to chill and be ready for the next phase of my life.(Now i will write my case in parts but all these parts are happening simultaneously)Part 1:Now when September came around, they sent out a mail informing us of a delay of 20 days citing that they had moved to a new bigger office space and logistics procurement had been delayed. Okay thats fine!After 20 days - another delay till october end after Diwali saying that the trainer was out on leave for a month. Hmmm! Something is fishy!October end - another delay till mid-December! This time they finally admitted that their finances weren’t looking good and very less clients have been coming in lately.Now mid December came around - and no shit Sherlock, they postponed the joining to February 2016.So we asked them to terminate our offer letter so that we can look for other jobs, but they weren’t ready to do so.Part 2:I had grown tired of this BS, but I amDuring all this free time, all I did was watch a lot of TV series, tonnes of Anime, movies, read books and manga, youtube, hang around in the interwebs, reddit, 4chan and all that shit.I hadn’t written any code in like 4 months. (But later take up Codecademy, freecodecamp, coursera, etc)Parents started looking down on me, comparing me with my other friends and cousins. Openly telling me their salary packages to my face. This only depressed me more.My college friends stopped talking to me, hanging out with me since they all were busy with their work and had met new friends in their worklife. Their new phase had started. Your friends start buying expensive stuff with their salaries and I am still dependant on my pocket money.Only person i talked to was my sibling, and even this person was disinterested in hearing me out.Anything that helped cope with my stress and mild depression was cyber bullying. I used to pick fights with people online especially on youtube(i was banned by three channels) and twitter (also 4chan). Thats how i mentained my sanity.No physical activity for months, made my add 10 more kg to my weight.I looked like a 30 year old with a huge beard despite being 22. Started to have hairfall.Part 3:Preparing for aptitude tests are a pain. During these months I learnt a bunch of new programming languages and frameworks(python, django, php, ruby, rails, mongDB, javascript, nodeJS, bootstrap, angular, metorJS, jQuery) but it was pointless as I had no projects to show for. And i am no algorithm genius to go and sit for product based companies.I registered for so many off-campus interviews. Didnt attend a single one.Its sad when you upload your resume and list your self as a fresher and all you get are blank lists in job hunting websites.And if at all you come across any, they give salries like 10K.You get tonnes of calls from call centers- night shift.In your mind, your self worth goes down day by day. why did i do engineering? i could have done BComm and still got this shit.Now from February onwards, I started working in that company. And what i do is boring PLSQL work. They put me in BI, and this reporting stuff is deteriorating my brain cells. I already hate my job for which i waited for so long. But i am still here because I atleast get paid at the end of the month, even though its peanuts compared to how much some of my friends are getting. Thinking about all that wasted effort in learning new languages and frameworks, i laugh at myself. What a waste!Currently I am at client side, still doing PLSQL and most of my co-workers are from BSc background doing .NET development, Informatica, Tableau, etc and me, an engineer does kids stuff- SQL and Excel work. They all look down on me as well.(Whoever reached till here, I know i have written this a bit randomly.

I was nowhere after reading this mail.Being a Jobless civil engineer, then with a little depression i was started to find jobs but even my interviews goes quite well they made sometimes my name in waiting list sometimes directly rejects me. After many hardless i got a contractual job in govt. with a salary of Rs.12000 which i joined and continued for a couple of months, but they treat me very inferior and nonsense type.I was crying at nights lonely cant express my frustration my inner depression as a jobless engineer, the days which were nightmare to me.By that time i was believing in astrologers, gods, praying to temples and prayed to god plz save me…plz give a job..bcz my neighbour & relatives all are looking at me humiliatingly. by that times my friends who got jobs sometimes will not pick my phone, avoiding me, give consolations this year you will get one. I was not attending any marriage party or go for any family occasions bcz there i would face only a single question “BETA USKE LADKE KA JOB HO GYA USKI BETI US COMPANY ME PLACED HO GYI..TUMHARA KYU NHI HO RAHA?

I did not get any campus placements even after scoring first class with all papers cleared in first attempt.So I moved to Bangalore in search of job by end of 2007, and joined a course for Java. I have 50 K money with me, this is the money I got as part of my mothers share. All my aim at that time was to get into a job, before I exhaust this 50K rupes.I paid 10 K to java institute and spent 2 months there. The training was so poor and contrary to what they promised, no companies came for campus recruitment. Every month I need to pay 2500 rupees rent in PG, andI passed out engineering in 2007.

All my aim at that time was to get into a job, before I exhaust this 50K rupes.I paid 10 K to java institute and spent 2 months there. The training was so poor and contrary to what they promised, no companies came for campus recruitment. Every month I need to pay 2500 rupees rent in PG, and cost of food is around 100 per day. The total cost per month would be around 5500 Rs.After 2 months, I was left with 30 K. Again I spent one more month, the balance amount came to 25K.I couldn't get a job in software, and my real passion is VLSI since I am commimg from ECE stream. I attended around 30 placememts both inside and outside the campus, but not a single one I am able to crack.I went to home with 25 K money. I told my parents about my VLSI dream. But my poor parents couldn't afford it. The fees was 50K for 6 months course, and rent + food cost 30 K till course completion.So I need another 55K for my dream course.I have to sell the golden chain of my mother as well a gold chain my grandma given to me before her death. We sold those gold chains and arranged money for my course. I was able to make some 45 K by selling those.So I went to Bangalore back with 70 K rupees and paid 25 K as first installment of the course. Now really I need to cut short my expense, otherwise I will run out of money. So I moved to friends house, where I pay around 2000 Rs for rent. That way I can save 500 rs per month.My bus fare was 10 rupees one side that time, so I walk past 2 stops so that I can save 2 rupees per day. Then I will have dosa from road side shops in the morning, so that I can skip lunch. I only ate breakfast and dinner. Lunch I used to have water, and then opted for tiger biscuit.On Saturdays and sundays, I will sleep the whole days and have one time food. This saves money. I will study the whole night on weekends. Weekends are holidays for the institute.On monthly basis my bank balance started diminishing, and I have to save each one rupee coin I have. Now I started walking 8 kms to office and then return in the evening by bus. That way I reduced bus fare from 20 rs to 8 rs. Earlier I saved 4 rupees by walking past 2 stops, so I can go for 8 + 8.To manage money, I brought all my B.Tech text books from native and sold it in Bangalore. I managed to bring some 20 Kg books by train. O got another 2500 Rs for that.By 5 th month, I am left with 4 K, and don't know what to do. I tried myself and got placed in a small company that is willing to pay me 3000 Rs per month. The company is working in the field of VLSI. I happily joined the company.The work hours are from 9 AM and can extend up to night 10 or 11. Sometimes night shifts. Though weekend are officially OFF, but they make us work on Saturdays mandatory. But I am so happy that they give 100 Rs food reimbursmet on saturdays and 100 Rs from snacks for night shift. I made use of this opportunity happily by testing my stamina and deteriorating my physical health.By 20 th, my purse will be left empty, and I need to survive for next 10 days. So I keep 100 rs in my wallet for bus fare for the next 10 days. I am lucky that they distribute snacks at 6 PM daily. So I will have only snacks from 20 the to 26 th, and tons of machine tea. Tiger biscuits for lunch and dinner.I get sodexo coupons worth 350 Rs on 26 or 27th of the month. So I use sodexo coupons from 26th to 30th the for food expense.By 1 st, I get 3000/rs stipend, in which Rs 2000 will be given as rent, and Rs 1000 would be iny purse. I need to manage food for 1000 Rs for next 20 days from 1st to 20th and bus fare as well.Me and my mom have 2 separate accounts in SBI. Since we don't have money to maintain AQB, I use this 3000 Rs and swing between both of these accounts to maintain a 1000 Rs AQB in bank savings account. Cumulative amount in account shall be 90K for a quarter. I manage it somehow to maintain bank account.This went for few months and one dayI was not even left with 10 rupees for bus fare. Then I made a call to my parents and asked them for some 400 rupees, telling them that my sandals got broken and I need money. I can't say my real situation to my parents because they will feel bad that they were not able to support me.My weight got reduced from 80 to 65 Kg in one year gap, and every time I say my parents its due to job stress. I hide the fact that I starve of limit my food intake to save money.All my friends were placed in tops MNCs in Bangalotr., earning some 18 to 20 K per month.I don't know I should say it here, there are couple of times, I searched the left overs of the food, which my friend brought as parcel. It happend 2 to 3 times.By this one year time frame, everybody branded me as a failure and only my parents given me the fire to pursue further.By end of 2009, I got 10 k per month, and my weight suddenly spiked from 63 Kg to 75 Kg in 2 months. Everybody got surprised, I told them I started eating junk food, that's why. Succcesfully hidfen the fact again.After 2011, I changed 2 companies and now its my 3 rd company. Now I get in hand around 1.8 lakhs per month and other benfits.Persistence and hardwork never goes waste.############Edit:I am really overwhelmed with happiness after seeing the comments, as I never thought my story would be an inspiration to others.I will clear some of the questions being raised in the comments:3. Somebody pointed about Government job, I somehow managed to arrange Rs 500 for applying BSNL JTO 2008 examination. After a great difficulty only I was able to arrange that money for application itself.4. Shiv Shankar Panda - Appreciate your comment. You said said the fact to the point.5.

So what went wrong you might be thinking.Let me tell you, nothing went wrong but that doesn’t mean everything was right. TheI haven’t read all the answers but I think there are less chances that somebody is jobless from past 5–6 years after completing B.tech and then M.tech. These 5–6 years I am counting are after masters degree.So I think its hard to find someone as jobless as me after masters degree.It wasn’t that my grades were low, I am a dull kinda student with poor reputation in college. I was a very sincere student. Never re-appeared in any subject throughout my bachelors and masters. So what went wrong you might be thinking.Let me tell you, nothing went wrong but that doesn’t mean everything was right. The recession was at peak at that time so campus placement was not an option. So I went for masters rather than wasting my years. I was not a topper neither a dull kind of student. I was an average student with percentage around 70 throughout my academics. In masters during campus placement the companies only hired one topper from each branch of M.tech. So I was left again without a job.Toppers are easily placed, they never have a problem in getting a job. Dull students know they can never get a job so they from beginning started to think about some other way of earning money, even their parents knew it and they do set some small business for them.During initial years I started to prepare for public sector. But all I learned from that, its not a place for average students like me. I did study hard for a year but a year is never enough for these exams for an average student. Due to this and some other reasons I gave up on it. Also along with it I posted my CV to every possible job portal on net, companies webistes, even delivered it by hand to several companies but not a single call from any. While I was completing my masters my all other friends they got placed in off campus drive in some MNC’s. They never get more marks than me, few of them were having a bunch of suplies in their final year. But still they get placed. I never envied them. I was happy for them. That’s my nature, I rarely feel jealous of anyone. Never think where my friends are gone and where I am. I always feel content with what I have and that is the reason I am still fighting happily these hard days of my life.What I did all these years was, I traveled, sometimes solo, sometimes with friends. Work out a lot. Every single day I worked my as off in gym. Didn’t worry about results just worked out hard. Fought with my innerself, console myself at each disappointed step. Sometimes I wanted to cry hard, sometimes I just want to go far away in himalayas. Relatives, parents, friends all have just one word on their lips, JOB JOB JOB!!I never showed how much I am upset from inside, how much I am dying from inside everyday. On outer I was a smiling face and helping people. Consoling others on their failure. Congratulating others on their success.The one thing that kept me going all these years and still is my workout. When I sweat in gym, the sweat contains all my disappointments, my failures, taunts of peoples of that day. I just refresh myself there and get back with to face this world again.The other thing that helped me is my selfishness nature. I never feel jealous or envious of others, I always thought that God has some plans for me for sure. I will get my fruit of patience in time. All I need is to trust in his doings.I never regret all these past years, they have taught me some very big lessons of life and I treasure them. There are no mistakes in life but only lessons.Life is hard but if you think its hard. This stress, this tension its not going to bring you anything. People who have job, they are not happy with their job. They goes through lot of stress. Same goes people who has their own business. People like me they are taking stress because they don’t have job. Then who is happy in this world? Everybody has some problem, this is the part and parcel of life. The only thing that will make you happy is to feel content with what you have. Stop looking what others are doing, how big is their car, their house. Everybody in this world who seems happy has a whole lot of big issues inside them. They are just showing off that how happy they are. I am not saying that one should not work hard or have big dreams. Have them and work hard to get them but not just to show off to your neighbors but to satisfy yourself. Do it if it makes you happy.So my suggestion is to never stop fighting and don’t give up. Never loose HOPE. “Travel a lot if you can. Travel solo. A solo trip is must for every being at one point in their life. Introspect your innerself and find out what really makes you happy.",160 followers,Sparsh Jain,1K,0,0,https://www.quora.com/How-is-the-life-of-a-jobless-student-after-the-completion-of-their-engineering-degree

Let me tell you a very harsh story now.Now another reality. Some of his friends started joining Gateforum and started preparation of GATE which is not an easy exam for sure. He tried but could not score as he had no guidance due to poor economic condition. Then some of the low level students(his mechanical buddies) got placed by the source of father, mother, uncle,aunt etc. The hero of this story still continued to send resumees through email to various companies. None of them gave reply as he was a fresher; A long pause in his career and his hope.Even if he got an opportunity from a well known company (I will NOT TELL THE NAME HERE), even after medical exam in which he passed, he was told that he was not needed.So people here always keep saying that engineers have lack of skills. How can you be so sure about their quality when they are not even given the opportunity!!! It is really a disgusting present situation.Edit: Thanks for upvotes to all of you.

This will affect your business positively in the long run. In spite of the high initial costs, custom software development is a long-term investment that almost always pays off in the end.Understanding the benefits of custom software development for both businesses and customers will help you make the right decisions for you and your business.1. Unique Solution that Belongs to Your Business OnlyThe biggest reason for developing custom software is your company wants to own the solution. Businesses can operate the software functions, data, developing methodologies, etc. With customized software, businesses can make changes anytime they want, add important information and implement feedback from customers. Creating an interactive relationship improves the credibility and stickiness of your business with customers.2. Personalized SolutionEvery customer or user wants to feel their interaction with a business is personal. Feeling like you’re being treated as an individual is a significant factor in customer satisfaction. When a company provides more personalized solutions, the company adds value to the business / customer relationship. Such added value generates customer loyalty and extends customer retention.3. Customer SatisfactionMckinsey statistics say that 71% of consumers expect companies to deliver personalized solutions, and 76% get frustrated when businesses don’t. Knowing the impact of a personalized user experience, the development of custom software is really important for customer satisfaction.4. SecurityOff-the-shelf software is generally easier to hack, because most use open-source code. Hackers and attackers are already aware of the vulnerabilities of such software, whereas custom-developed software is a closed source project and is only used by your team. Hence, the chances of intrusions are minimized.5. IntegrationWith developers on staff or retained, integrating custom software with your existing business software should be easy. Moreover, custom software can implement existing processes without having to conform to the limitations of an arbitrary API.6. Flexibility & ScalabilityBusinesses can make changes anytime to customized software as per the needs of the business. And if you’re smart, scalability will be one feature flagged as necessary in your initial project scope. Off-the-shelf applications, on the other hand, cannot be manipulated at will. And if you do change anything, you’ll likely violate your licensing agreement with your off-the-shelf software providers, making it impossible to continue maintenance and usability of the application.7. ReliabilityApplication reliability is key for all businesses. Using a custom solution is more secure and reliable, because you own all the rights and dictate how it is modified and maintained. Custom software developers normally use the highest quality tools and industry-leading security standards, because the end application reflects on them personally. As such, you can alway rely on top performance and reliability.","44,248 followers",Kurt Guntheroth,965,13.7K,166.9M,https://www.quora.com/How-is-the-life-of-a-jobless-student-after-the-completion-of-their-engineering-degree

Afterall, that’s what software development really is about - solving a problem. And while we can generalize and say people and businesses face a lot of the same problems in day-to-day life, it doesn’t mean a one-size-fits-all approach is best. Many business problems are quite specific when you get down to it, and an off-the-shelf piece of software may not address every concern.Take a company that managed legal services for healthcare organizations. They had to have access to internal systems for the hospitals they worked with, they needed to obtain, edit, and submit reports with insurance company systems, and also needed to be in contact with patients. There was a lot of data to be collected and move around in several different proprietary systems with highly classified and regulated information. This is not something Zapier makes a plug-in for…So in this particular case, Maxiom Technology, a custom software development organization based in the DC area, developed a solution using RPA (robotic process engineering) that was HIPAA compliant and allowed the company to save a bundle of time and money. To process a batch of these reports, previously, it took large groups of people to manually enter everything, and averaged 3–4 days of work. So all these people were being paid for all this time to do something horribly mundane. The custom software Maxiom implemented allowed everything to be done AUTOMATICALLY (no humans required) in 3–4 HOURS. This also improved business relations and success with the partners involved - the hospitals were happier, the insurance companies were happier, and patients received more accurate information in a more timely manner. On the whole, this ended up saving the client hundreds of thousands of dollars each year.This is just one example of why you want a custom software solution, rather than any old thing that’s out there already. Specific problems can’t be effectively solved with something made for mass appeal. You need people to understand YOU and your problems, and then design something that will solve it the best, not just in part.",0 followers,Brian Warre,1K,0,0,https://www.quora.com/How-is-the-life-of-a-jobless-student-after-the-completion-of-their-engineering-degree
