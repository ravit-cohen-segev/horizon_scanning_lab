In that case, we can count the number of times the state transition function is used. Each use of the transition function will ordinarily correspond to a movement of the head as well.In aSo the correct answer is “anything that takes some time to perform.”But, often we analyze an algorithm in a less rigorous fashion where the computational model is not explicitly defined.In practice, analysis might focus on just a particular type of operation that is judged to be representative. For example, matrix multiplication algorithms are typically measured by the number of scalar operations they perform, ignoring any overhead from indexing or branching or looping.In asymptotic analysis, the worst-scaling part of an algorithm eventually dominates all the other parts. So as long as an “operation” covers that worst-scaling behavior, it doesn’t matter too much to give a precise definition. For example, memory access costs often dominate in real implementations, but if the number of mathematical operations grows at a faster rate, then asymptotic analysis can ignore the number of memory accesses. But, if an algorithm mainly performs memory accesses, then they have to be counted as operations.A common fallacy is to measure all mathematical actions, like addition, as if they are a constant-time operation. In reality, the time to do an addition does increase as we let the numbers get larger, beyond a single computer word. So an “operation” should be a","20,816 followers",Michal Forišek,1K,1.2K,10M,https://www.quora.com/What-counts-as-a-distinct-operation-when-calculating-the-time-and-space-complexity-of-an-algorithm

Anyway, China and India share a border of about 2,000 kilometers. But. the border disputes were negative legacies mainly due to former British rule to India.The two neighbors are both big nations and major powers in Asia. We Chinese value “harmonious development” and think we should have harmonious relations between human and nature, among nations, among co-workers, among family members......When we call for “win-win” cooperation, we are not just taking it as a slogan, instead, we are really hoping so and inserting efforts to do so.Then, to the question:India is recently forging closer ties with the US, Japan, and Australia, etc., trying to form a “diamond” to contain China’s development. Compared to the other three nations, India is obviously lagging behind in various aspects. Do Indians, especially those who have a hostile attitude towards China and think it’s necessary to contain China, really think the “diamond” will work as they wish? Do they have any idea that India is just taken as a “chessman” by others?So, my suggestion would be: whether China will become a “superpower” or not, both China and India should first focus in their internal issues, to develop a more completed industry system, to catch up with the new waves of technological innovation, to build better infrastructures, to provide better education and social welfare, to create a sounder international environment...... for the two nations and their people. With a solid foundation in both sides, then join hands together, to work for a better bilateral cooperation and to build Asia into a better continent for all its inhabitants.EDITS (April 24, 2018): Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to visit China for one-on-one summit with Xi JinpingModi to visit central China for one-on-one summit with XiAccording to South Morning Post:“Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi will travel to central China this week for an informal summit with Chinese President Xi Jinping, a meeting analysts say could help the two Asian giants reset ties.Modi is also due to travel to China in June for a regional security summit – it is highly unusual for a foreign leader to visit the country twice in such quick succession.…….The two leaders will meet one-on-one, without any ministers or advisers, and the summit aimed to redefine the future relationship of the two countries, according to Indian media reports. It will also coincide with the historic meeting between the leaders of North and South Korea.……A Chinese analyst said Modi’s visit would be a chance for the two sides to reset ties following last year’s protracted military stand-off in the disputed Himalayan border region of Doklam.”I have to say, this is really a good sign and an important move for both nations.Welcome to China, PM Modi!

It does not go to war unnecessarily. Based on the principles of ahimsa, it has a peaceful controlled attitude and minds its own business. At all times from Independence, the country has built up its reserves in the sheer numbers of its forces. Only China has a similar capability.India gained nuclear capabilities way back in 1974! Never once did India threaten to use this capability on anyone else. That in itself is the most sensible thing to do. At the time, I remember, other nuclear club members ran advertisements mocking India with a begging bowl and starving people. That was partly correct. However, the mere knowledge that a country was meant to be subdued and quiet had developed superpower capabilities could not be stomached so quickly, by other nuclear club members. At the time, nuclear capabilities defined ‘superpower’ status. It still does. The crooked metaphor is: the more you can kill, the more muscle you have! Wrong. India does not contribute to such a flagrant loss of lives. That alone makes it a superpower!India is a ‘soft superpower’, and it does not stockpile destructive materials within its borders or elsewhere. Yet it can call, manufacture and use any number of armaments at short notice. These capacities are stored in scientists' heads and vast databases for ‘instant’ recall.India can fire a space probe to the moon at 1/100th the cost of an American one! That means the country can produce 100 rockets for the price of 1 NASA rocket! Does anybody know what that means?The superpower capacity is calculated in theoretical knowledge rather than stockpile knowledge. A country cannot continue manufacturing weaponry that goes obsolete in a week. The call-up rate is disproportionate to the use ratio. The US needs to go to war with the slightest excuse. It is to use its obsolete weaponry and kick start the full production capabilities to upgrade to the latest. There are two ways this can be done. Theoretically or practically. Which one would you choose?Look at the global reach of the world's biggest businesses. Where do they get their human resources from? Good guess. India!

However, foreign investment in India is quite different from that in China.Foreign investment in India is aimed at capturing the domestic demand of India,Foreign investment in China, the purpose is not only to occupy the Chinese market, but to meet the needs of the world!Foreign investment in India, more to meet the Indian government's market access requirements,It is easy to judge that Indian made products are not globally competitive and it is hard to see any Indian made products outside India.Second, India may miss out on a fourth industrial revolutionMany people call breakthroughs in high-speed communications, new energy, new materials, life sciences, artificial intelligence and other fields the fourth industrial revolution.But indians are still keen on IT and have invested little in the fourth industrial revolution.I am not saying India is not investing, but very little, less than one tenth of China.In the future, the level of science and technology will determine the strength of a country, or even the destiny of a country.Third, India's environmental crisisAs a Chinese, I have witnessed the destruction of China's environment by industrialization.It is easy to destroy the environment, but difficult to repair it. Today, the annual investment in environmental protection in China far exceeds the sum of education and military expenditure.But it will take generations to repair the environment, and some will never be.Unfortunately, I saw similar environmental damage in India, which has a higher population density and a lower environmental carrying capacity than China.India must solve its environmental problems, which may cause social instability and unrest.Fourth, India's education crisisIn particular, inequality in education,Personally, 20% of people in India get a good education, but the quality and environment of education for the other 80% is really bad.Inequality in education leads to inequality in life development,India should pay special attention to the quality of mass education and invest heavily in it.","4,494 followers",Sanjit Sinhasan,900,249,4.2M,https://www.quora.com/How-can-India-become-a-superpower-1

Tumors can either be benign, malignant, or benign in pathology, but malignant due to location and regrowth potential. I actually fall into this last category since my tumor is located near the brainstem and I suffer a mass effect every time it regrows (my brainstem gets compressed). My particular tumor is a pilocytic astrocytoma which behaves like cancer in that it recurs quite frequently (hence the need for multiple surgeries).Remember how I said that the brain is an organic super computer? This is due to the fact that the brain is actually a sort of quantum computer–it is able take over functions from one part that is damaged/removed from the brain due to a really cool ability called neuroplasticity. This allows you to recover from severe brain trauma and surgeries.To answer your question yes and no. If the tumor is highly malignant surgery will require removing “good” brain tissue in order to remove the tumor. This space will then be filled in by CSF (Cerebral Spinal Fluid). If the tumor is benign, surgery is usually able to remove only the tumor since there is a distinct barrier between the brain and the tumor. The space that was occupied is then filled up with CSF. Some tumors are located in hard to reach spots in the brain and require the surgeon to go around and sometimes through healthy brain tissue. In this case patients will suffer some brain deterioration, but thanks to neuroplasticity most functions lost are regained over time.Another thing to consider with any brain surgery is the possibility of getting an acquired brain injury. An acquired brain injury (ABI) is similar to a traumatic brain injury (TBI). Not many surgeons will even mention that this can occur from surgery. I unfortunately received multiple acquired brain injuries which were progressively worse after subsequent surgeries. I lost my ability to speak, walk, or feed myself. I became quick to anger, and had short term memory issues (i.e. I would enter a room and forget the reason for going). I also suffered from time distortion which is the inability to recognize how much time had passed: what seemed like hours would feel like minutes and vice versa.

India is an emerging major economy and is expected to grow faster in the coming years and subsequently overtake Brittain and Japan soon.India has its interest all over the world , especially in the Indian ocean . 70% of global sea trade happens through Indian ocean where India is the major player controlling the maritime affairs in the region.Being an aspiring super power ,India has been projected to a powerful country in Asia. Malaysia's economy is based mainly on export of palm oil industry and computer hardware ,rubber and tin and some other oil products . India has been the major country where the maximum exports has been receiving from Malaysia and it was a major trade partner ,India is the biggest palm oil market of Malaysia . But the recent issues between the nations made it crucial for Malaysia to export its goods to India as India stopped import of palm oils as well as put restrictions and sanctions on import from Malaysia on the backdrop of controversial statement made my Malaysian prime minister mahathir bin Mohammed. Which provoked India to take some tough decisions over Malaysia which led to sanctions.Malaysia has now realized that the sanctions and restrictions by India has impact on their economy and do not want to be confronted further and wanted to stay away from the boiling issue and send a peaceful gesture that they are not enough to fight a trade war with powerful nation like IndiaThis the reason Malaysia restrained further actions or escalations.Thank you.Also read :Also read :Also read :Top Gun Global AffairsDefense technologyNew Digital technologiesClick on the above links👆Follow these spaces for amazing international affairs , current affairs and defense technology developmentsUpvote and follow me for more details",738 followers,Sreehari Nambiar VV,2.7K,544,3.3M,https://www.quora.com/How-can-India-become-a-superpower-1

I knew everything there is to know about this hate preacher but my better sense prevailed and I said I had no idea who he was. He then launched into a diatribe against India and how Muslims are being targeted and I could sense he was trying to provoke me into a debate but for my own safety I kept my mouth shut and acted dumb. When he didn't get the reply he was hoping for so he can engage me in a debate he shut up and I started chilling and enjoying the view. After sometime I was almost about to sleep as I was tired when I was woken up by a loud sound coming from the stereo. It seemed like some kind of Islamic preaching or verses. Now he was well within his rights to play what he wanted to in his car but he seemed he was deliberately playing it at full volume to inconvenience me. I kept mum and put on my headphones, when he gestured towards me and asked me if I like it. I replied that it felt peaceful and good though I was obviously lying. Some people might say it's better to follow the Philosophy of an “eye for an eye” but I am the kind of guy who doesn't prefer to argue with radical people as it's meaningless, especially when safety is involved. When he drew into the porch of my hotel, I smiled at him, payed him and as I got out and could see there were Gurkha gaurds outside the hotel, I slammed the car door shut pretty hard as he sat gawking. Now I am not stereotyping the entire makay population there and I met plenty of forward thinking locals in KL but still I could sense creeping Islamic fundamentalism.Edit 1:When this question popped up in my feed and I wrote this answer as I could immediately recall the above incident, I couldn't have imagined in my wildest dreams it will get these many upvotes. Thanks :)To give some context to the above incident, this happened in 2017 before mahathir came to power. I have not been to KL since but my friends there have told me the situation has become worse. I would like to clarify that I am not painting the whole Malay population with the same brush. There are genuinely nice, forward thinking and open minded malays, especially amongst millennials and gen z who are urbanized. In fact it was one of malay friends who was introduced to me by a common friend who showed around Langkawi and personally took me to the famous hotspots there. The day I reached there it was raining, but she still took me around and even patiently took my pics at skybridge even though it was raining as I had to catch a flight back the same day. I also made many Malaysian Chinese friends who are nice people but I got the sense from them that they resented the bhumputera privileges given to Muslim Malays by the Malaysian govt where they got special quotas in college and government jobs. The sad part is the politicians of Malaysia are fishing in troubled waters and created hatred between communities for votes.there.",6 followers,Param Goyal,1K,108,1.2M,https://www.quora.com/How-can-India-become-a-superpower-1

The Customs Department has also been asked to conduct a thorough inspection of microprocessors being imported from Malaysia.Mahathir said in October that India ""invaded and occupied"" Kashmir, a disputed Muslim-majority region also claimed by Pakistan.

As a result, India is planning to impose trade sanctions on Malaysia. For example, curbing the import of palm oil, India is the largest importer of palm oil from Malaysia.Now comes, why Malaysia doesn't want to retaliate with similar measures against India. Fundamental number four might is right. That means India is a big market for Malaysian products, India is a big economy. if we look at the trade for 2018–19 Malaysia’s export to India was $11billion and India export to Malaysia for 2018–19 was $ 6.4 billion. So who is gaining from the bilateral trade, obviously, Malaysia with a $4.6 billion trade surplus with India??Now it would unwise for Malaysia to retaliate against India as this will make no sense because it is Malaysia who is gaining more from the trade. Therefore, realism prevails over idealism in IR.In conclusion, Malaysia should not have interfered with the internal matters of other countries.

Moreover, World has been looking for balance most importantly through a powerful democratic country like India as they respect and aspire every countries to achieve its objectives. india is the only country which follows climate observations and implement sustainable developments proposed by united nations. India has taken a lot of initiatives to establish peace in the country as well as restoring energy availability through renewable energy sources.Therefore making India as an enemy state won't help them to meet their interests in the region and they may even get isolated by the world as India's support from other countries are very strong in nature . These apart , We could also see, how Malaysia suffered by their immature statement supporting Pakistan contradicting India very recently. they even came up with a statement saying they don't want to escalate it since India's position in the world is very strong .Turkey is also a major player as far as central Asia is concerned. They had also been involved in many wars as part of Allie ,and had made many contribution as well. Turkey is a secular state but has majority of Muslim population and it projects a strong Islamic ideology and they have some interest on that particular aspect transforming the country into an Islamic state . Moreover ,when Pakistan was running with begging bowl for support on Kashmir issue, these were the only two countries which showed some supports. On top of that, turkey is also a major defense partner of Pakistan and Pakistan uses many weapon systems from Turkey like helicopters and armed force vehicles .Recently India had put sanctions on Malaysia on the backdrop of contradictory statements made on Kashmir issue curtailing imports and exports. And Further escalation by turkey may also face the same if it finds necessary. turkey import and export many raw materials from India and vice versa , india is also a major exporter of explosives to turkey. India recently warned turkey not to indulge unnecessarily into India's internal affairs making statements and reminded them to stay away from India's internal matters. Any violation on that may lead to Further escalation and may bring sanctions on turkey also . Hence in my opinion ,If turkey continues pulling India's leg and question India's supermacy on Kashmir , India must raise the issue of kurds in turkey who have been facing persecution and facing human right violation denying rights in the country.So the lip service between turkey and Pakistan is just an one-man show for short period in order to seek the attention of the world and It is not going to effect India in any way.Jai hindTop Gun Global AffairsDefense technologyNew Digital technologiesClick on the above links👆Follow these spaces for amazing international affairs , current affairs and defense technology developmentsfollow me for more information","114,982 followers",Daveed Phoenix,5.4K,9.9K,159.8M,https://www.quora.com/How-can-India-become-a-superpower-1

He would go around to all these department heads and offer to help them out by taking those excess funds off their hands. He put together a computing project that involved complex modeling to transfer those funds to. Those of us who volunteered to help, got advanced computers - at the time I got a Silicon Graphics 3D modeling machine, which was one of the most advanced desktops available.So some of us had awesome computers - many had stuff running an old version of Windows that could barely run Microsoft Office apps.",9 followers,Andrew McGregor,1.1K,12.9K,66.9M,https://www.quora.com/How-can-India-become-a-superpower-1
35,"The trend in supercomputing is to use commodity CPU's so that actual processors, ram, Ghz, and OS for a single node is really no different from the processors, ram, Ghz, and OS that you can get for a high end desktop machine.  (i.e. the OS is often some form of Linux that you can download).  Some supercomputers use GPU cards, but you can buy one of those yourself.What makes a supercomputer ""super"" is not the individual node, but the fact that you have thousand, sometimes tens of thousands of nodes in parallel, and the ""secret sauce"" in a supercomputer is not the OS, but rather the interconnectThe trend in supercomputing is to use commodity CPU's so that actual processors, ram, Ghz, and OS for a single node is really no different from the processors, ram, Ghz, and OS that you can get for a high end desktop machine.

Also one *huge* problem is power and cooling.  Each node consumes 500-1000 watts.  Put 2000 of them together, and you are talking about massive cooling and power issues.The reason for this is economics.  There are not enough supercomputers to justify custom designing a chip for supercomputing.  However, there are hundred of millions of people willing to play video games, and people design chips and CPU's for gamers, and then tweak them a bit, add interconnects, and you have a supercomputer.",0 followers,Sriramachandran,527,0,0,https://www.quora.com/How-can-India-become-a-superpower-1
36,"Badly.These super computers are built for very specific tasks. They have a lot of processor power, but that processing power is designed to calculate different things like weather simulations, gravity simulations, etc.They do not even have GPUs the way NVidia and AMD make them.Just as the NASA supercomputers are built to specialize in simulations and physics calculations, gaming desktops are built to specialize in running modern video games.Your $1000 desktop gaming PC more likely will run a modern AAA video game better than any $100,000,000 super computer.

37,"NASA's newest supercomputer has garnered the number three spot on the Top500 list of the world's most powerful computers.The announcement was made Nov. 17, 2008 at the International Conference for High-Performance Computing, Networking, Storage, and Analysis (SC08) in Austin, Texas.They also have never been replaced since then.The Pleiades supercomputer is an SGI® Altix® ICE system with 12,800 Intel Xeon quad-core processors (51,200 cores, 100 racks) running at 487 trillion floating point operations per second (teraflops) on the LINPACK benchmark, the industry standard for measuring a system'sNASA's newest supercomputer has garnered the number three spot on the Top500 list of the world's most powerful computers.The announcement was made Nov. 17, 2008 at the International Conference for High-Performance Computing, Networking, Storage, and Analysis (SC08) in Austin, Texas.They also have never been replaced since then.The Pleiades supercomputer is an SGI® Altix® ICE system with 12,800 Intel Xeon quad-core processors (51,200 cores, 100 racks) running at 487 trillion floating point operations per second (teraflops) on the LINPACK benchmark, the industry standard for measuring a system's floating point computing power. One of the most powerful general-purpose supercomputers ever built, Pleiades also features the world's largest InfiniBand® interconnect network.The LINPACK run also measured electrical power consumption—an increasingly important consideration in high-end computing. Using a total of 2.09 megawatts, or 233 megaflops per watt, Pleiades is among the most energy-efficient supercomputers in the world.""Pleiades represents a significant engineering achievement in several ways,"" said William Thigpen, Pleiades project manager at the NASA Advanced Supercomputing (NAS) Division at Ames. In addition to its power and InfiniBand record, ""Pleiades can run NASA codes with minimal modifications, and is compatible with standard desktop engineering workstations so our users can migrate codes easily from their desktops. Users from all key mission areas will have an enormous resource to meet their critical milestones,"" Thigpen added.Among the scientific and engineering projects accepted for computer time on Pleiades:""Over a record-making few weeks, NASA has again deployed one of the most powerful supercomputers in the world,"" said Eng Lim Goh, chief technology officer at SGI. ""In the race to achieve superior computational power, NASA's knowledge of rapid yet productive deployment is a rare advantage. We are proud to be part of NASA's ongoing journey to show the world what is possible.""""We look forward to seeing the science breakthroughs enabled by Pleiades,"" said Stephen Wheat, senior director for high performance computing at Intel Corp. ""It's rewarding to see that the performance features of the Intel® Xeon® quad-core processors meet the growing computational challenges of the nation's space program.""The fabric interconnecting Pleiades' 6,400 nodes requires more than 20 miles of double data rate cabling. InfiniBand® is also used as the primary local-area network backbone that interconnects computing, storage, and visualization systems, and to facilitate cross-system data file access. This enables scientific visualization and data analysis to execute concurrently as computer jobs run, producing ultra-high-fidelity results for the enormous datasets used in NASA mission projects.Pleiades was acquired to augment the space agency's Columbia supercomputer in supporting NASA's four key mission areas: aeronautics research, exploration systems, science, and space operations.",UNKNOWN,Robert Frost,671,9.4K,195.4M,https://www.quora.com/How-can-India-become-a-superpower-1
