Say, a railgun!Those can reach much higher escape velocities. And don’t need oxygen combustion.He’d completelly still miss the Earth, of course. The shooteer needs to do complex computations to calculate his ballistic trajectory juuuuuust riiiiigght, accounting for his loccation on the Moon and the Moon’s gravity and even the Earth’s and Moon’s relative movement speeds in space, so that the bullet can reach the Earth.This is akin to shooting an iron bullet at a fast moving car far away while standing right next to a super magnet: not only the magnet will make the bullet’s trajectory curve a lot, but even without that big magnet there, by the time the bullet would reach where the car was, that car has already moved and is no longer there anyway. So yeah: trick shot!Even then, a bullet is too small to reach the ground, it would just kind of melt away upon reentry or just explode in the atmosphere. Even if it reaches the ground (say it is made of a special very impact resistant and super high heat resistant ceramic compound, so that only bits of it evaporate away), the bullet will be so hardly slowed down by the reentry it would quickly start tumbling down, i.e. merelly falling down, instead of still being traveling at supersonic shooting speeds. Reentry actually has to be made at as SUPER precise angle in order to avoid that kind of atmospheric “tumbling”. Even if you make the bullet rotate as fast as you can (to give it more inertia), a bullet is simply not massive enough to remain aligned perfectly all the way to the ground.Now, a ballitics computer assisted rail gun cannon, on the other hand, could easily hit a (big) target on the Earth while keeping its supersonic speeds.But a mere gun? Even a big one to be held with both hands by a strong Arnold Schwarzy?Nope.In fact all those Yankee Lunarians kinda are presently in the habit of shooting their lunarian guns at us all the time (mainly because every saturday they just love to attend these huge “mooncows” rodeo parties), and yet we never even had so much as a single bullet hit anything anywhere over here! ;-)EDIT: Several commenters corrected that the solid propeller powrder already contains enough oxygen anyway so I’m wrong on that point and they’re completely right.

4,"What will happen if an astronaut fires a gun from the Moon aiming at Earth?Let’s work out what would actually be required to fire a bullet from the Moon to reach the Earth.What the bullet needs to do is reach the point between the Moon and the Earth where their gravitational pull cancels out.

After this the Earth’s gravity will dominate and pull the bullet the rest of the way. Put another way, the bullet has to reach the point of maximum gravitational potential between the two. Here’s how the potential varies with distance from the centre of the Moon on the direct path from Moon to Earth:The red dashed lines mark the potential at the Moon’s surface and that at the maximum point. All the bullet needs to do to escape the Moon and start being pulled in towards Earth is have enough energy to bridge this gap, which is around 2.6 MJ/kg. To have this amount of kinetic energy the bullet has to be fired at an initial velocity of around 2270 m/s towards Earth.But there’s a further complication. The Moon is of course in orbit around the Earth, with an orbital velocity of around 1020 m/s. The bullet is therefore also travelling at this velocity before firing, and so simply firing towards Earth will just result in a total velocity heading somewhere between Earth and the orbital direction of the Moon.Therefore in order for the resulting velocity of the bullet to be directly towards Earth, it will have to be fired diagonally between the Earth and where the Moon has come from, at a speed sufficient to also cancel the orbital velocity:Earth is at the origin on the left here, to scale, and the Moon is too small to see at the base of the blue orbital velocity arrow.So the firing speed needed is around 2480 m/s, at an angle of around 28˚ back towards where the Moon has come from.In fact although both the principals above apply, it’s a little more complex due to the Moon’s orbit around the Earth. Firstly this orbit moves the point of maximum potential around with it, so that a straight path to Earth would involve reaching a higher point of potential on the way. But the orbiting Moon also pulls the bullet off track, and so this needs to be compensated for with a greater firing angle.The bullet ends up with a curved trajectory like this example, again with the Earth on the left and the Moon orbiting anticlockwise from the right:The firing speed in this example is 2510 m/s at an angle of 54˚ off centre. Of course to achieve this speed would require a gun that’s a lot more powerful than any normal gun.The bullet initially heads away from the direction of the Moon’s orbit, quickly being pulled back by the Moon but not before it has crossed the potential peak on the path that it’s following. From here on it’s caught by the Earth’s gravity, finally striking the Earth on the side away from the Moon after a total travel time of around 4.5 days. The trajectory is similar to that of the returning Apollo space missions.And just like the Apollo missions, whether the bullet finally makes it to the Earth’s surface depends on it surviving the trip through the atmosphere, as by this time the Earth has accelerated the bullet to a speed of over 11 km/s.",UNKNOWN,Viktor T.

Not good.Light Gas GunLight gas guns can accelerate bullets up to 8.5 km/sec. These are used in labs to simulate meteorite impacts. 8.5 km/sec is vastly in excess of lunar escape velocity. On the moon 8.5 km/sec can escape the Earth moon system.So, just as a silencer might be added to a gun, a gun can have a light gas ‘accelerator’ attached to the end of the barrel. The high pressure coupling that connects to the gun has a source of hydrogen to fill the barrel of the gun (now the pump tube) The gun of course must be sufficiently gas tight to maintain adequate light gas pressure from the supplies available. The bullet becomes the piston, which may be a special round made for this purpose, and the projectile or bullet you’re firing is put into a magazine at the end of the barrel.In this way you could have a moon farmer shoot at invading spaceships from Earth and have a chance of hitting them. A worker recently fired by Terra Enterprises might go out one night and shoot the Earth with his light gas gun, and have a chance of hitting the Earth. Of course protected by 10 tons of air per square meter, the projectile could make it to Earth but would burn up harmlessly in the Earth’s atmosphere. It could hit something though on the 11.6 hour flight from Moon to Earth.10 million moon people angry at the recent rise in Moon taxes from the UN could organise over the lunar internet to go out one night and fire billion rounds at Earth in protest. The Billion Round march it might be called. Fire a round every 15 minutes for 24 hours - and you basically have flooded every side of Earth with millions of pellets.This amount of high speed projectiles whizzing between Earth and Moon would basically destroy most orbital infrastructure near Earth, despite the fact it would have very little impact on Earth’s surface because they would all burn up.Diagram of a light-gas gun1AddendumA 1200 m/sec round can travel 1216.35 km max.A 1600 m/sec round can travel 3409.88 km maxSo someone with a hand gun on the moon, can launch what amounts to an ICBM on Earth. It doesn’t matter if your significant other is in a city 1000 km away with their new lover. You can go out your back door and shoot in their general direction and reach them. Of course to actually hit them requires ‘smart’ bullets. But they have those today. So its a cinch everyone will have them on the moon tomorrow.The good news is - moon travel mellows people and puts them in a different frame of mind - so misuse of firearms is highly unlikely. Furthermore, smart bullets also imply smart guns. While we do not have a lot of rules covering a lot of things in most free society, that doesn’t mean we’re lawless.

Some are easy to verify, some aren’t. Some are in Number Theory, some in the Theory of Computation, some in Logic and some in Topology (and maybe a few other fields, we’ll see).ClaimThis was a genuine conjecture made by Pierre de Fermat, who verified thatThe counterexample comes precisely at the next number,In fact, Fermat was about as wrong about this as can be: as far as we can tell, pastClaim (Tait’s Conjecture)This was proposed in 1884 by P. G. Tait as a way to prove the famous 4-Color Theorem: Tait showed (quite easily) that the 4-color theorem follows from this statement. It took more than 60 years for Bill Tutte to find this counterexample:This graph is obviously planar, it is obviously cubic (every vertex has exactly three neighbors), it is slightly less obviously 3-connected (it cannot be separated by removing one or two vertices), and it’s not Hamiltonian (there’s no way to visit all the vertices in one continuous path with no loops). This last part isn’t at all obvious but it’s also not super difficult to prove, either. It’sClaimThis conjecture was made by none other than Leonhard Euler, as a certain extension of Fermat’s Last Theorem.Euler observed that it’s easy to add up two squares to get a square, as inThis isn’t true, but it took almost 200 years to find a counterexample.The first counterexample was found in 1966 by Lander and Parkin, using a computer search. They discovered that27You can find their original paperThis shows that Euler was wrong whenThat took considerably more ingenuity than a mere computer search. In 1986, 20-year-old2682440Finally, forWe aren’t quite done with Euler, though.ClaimLook at the following array of cards.A♠ K♥ Q♦ J♣See how clever this is: every row contains each rank (J, Q, K, A) exactly once, as does each column. Also, every row contains each suit (♠,♥,♦,♣) exactly once, as does each column. But moreover, the two arrangements of rank and suits are so mixed up that no card appears twice in the entire array: the Jack of Hearts appears just once, as does the Queen of Spades, and so on for all possible combinations.Without this last “orthogonality” condition, what you’d have here is just two superimposed Sudoku puzzles of order 4. But the requirement to have none of the pairs appear twice makes it a very hard puzzle, hard enough to interest the great Euler. He used latin and greek letters to build those arrays, earning them then name Graeco-Latin square. Here’s such an array of order 3.Euler was able to construct such arrays for every odd order and for every order divisible by 4. It’s easy to see that there’s no such array for order 2 (exercise!), and Euler was unable to build one of order 6, so he proposed that the orders 2, 6, 10, 14, … are impossible. Those are the even numbers that aren’t divisible by 4.Euler was wrong about that, too, and once again it took more than 150 years for this conjecture to be refuted (at this point I should probably mention that Euler was one of the most profound and creative mathematicians of all time, and those conjectural snafus were quite uncharacteristic of him.)Euler was right about order 6, though it was only in 1901 that this was proven. But in 1959,Here’s an orthogonal array of order 10: every 2-digit combination appears exactly once, and every row and every column contain every digit in both the first and second places.ClaimThe theory of Turing degrees is a truly beautiful idea. It studies the computational aspects of sets of numbers, and reveals an amazingly intricate structure from a few simple definitions. Here are the minimum basics we need.A set of natural numbers is calledNot every set of natural numbers is computable, because there are far too many sets and far too few possible computer programs to detect them. As a concrete example of a non-computable set, consider the set of numbers which encode (in some way) computer programs which halt. No computer program can correctly determine if a number is or isn’t in the set .Now, suppose you are given a magical gadget whichEmil PostBut they do. Richard Friedberg and Albert Muchnik, independently, developed the idea known as the Priority Method and constructed such peculiar sets. This opened a whole new field of study, exploring the rich structure of Turing degrees and their partial order.ClaimGeorg Cantor, the creator of the Theory of Sets, wondered if there’s an uncountable set of real numbers which cannot be put in correspondence with the real numbers.

In 1938, Kurt Gödel proved that this hypothesis is consistent with ZFC, which is the same thing as saying that there’s a model of ZFC – A “universe of sets” – in which CH is true. Some people believed this was an indication that CH is, indeed, true, which means that there are no models of ZFC in which CH is false.In fact, people generally had no idea how to build models of ZFC other than the “natural” ones likePeople don’t usually think of a model of ZFC+ClaimIt’s very easy to construct uncountable groups: the circle, the torus, the group ofIt’s possible, but very far from easy.

It can be expressed as the sum of two primes in 8 ways.In 1742, Christian Goldbach wrote a letter toEuler, likely the most prolific mathematician of all time, wrote back and said,If Euler couldn’t prove it, you can be certain that its proof is not an easy one.Indeed, as of 2019, it has not been proven.Using computers it has been shown that Goldbach’s Conjecture holds for all even numbers up to around 4 billion billion.Mathematicians are getting there. Just a few years back, in 2013, Harald Helfgott showed that every even integer greater than two can be expressed as the sum of no more than 4 primes. There’s a reasonable chance that Goldbach’s Conjecture will be proven within a decade or so.By the way, if you come up with a proof that has been verified, it is worth $1,000,000.","29,945 followers",Senia Sheydvasser,1.3K,2.3K,28.3M,https://www.quora.com/What-will-happen-if-an-astronaut-fires-a-gun-from-the-Moon-aiming-at-Earth

First the mechanics of how your approach (the idea that you take equation XYZ and work out some fancy advanced thing from it) fails at this specific moment and then philosophy as to why that way of thinking always fails within physics (but works within pure math).First of all, the inner shell electrons for almost any atom other than a Hydrogen or Helium atom are relativistic, meaning nonrelativistic QM like the Schroedinger equation doesn’t apply. Next, in order to do QFT calculations, the math is effectively intractable unless you switch over to Feynman diagrams and diagrammatica techniques. Even then the number of loops and other factors that you include makes the problem intractable, so you need to do normalization tricks. None of the above are compatible with rigorous mathematics and is the core difference between how a mathematicians and a physicists brains work.At some point in time in a classroom you can start telling people with math brains apart from physics brains around relativistic quantum field theory (aka QFT). QFT is unfortunately only reached by very advanced undergrads at top schools or theory students in most grad schools, so all the years prior to that point become wasted education when the student realizes they can’t handle this way of thinking unless they switch to another topic or go into experiment instead of theory or switch to pure math and just don’t work on physics anymore.A physicist writes equations to describe the phenomena in the real universe (of which some might be undiscovered and therefore impossible to write equations for, and by the way cannot be discovered by expanding on existing physics laws either for complex reasons beyond this short answer, but the laws of physics themselves instead get rewritten from scratch using new paradigms).A mathematician writes expressions, theorems, generalizations, and other such constructs based on assumed axioms. The physicist guesses out of thin air the correct equations using genius (Seriously…math is something you build up afterwards retroactively as a double check and a way to describe your theory to other people….Feynman describes this in one of his recorded video clips as physicists just guessing the answers and throwing out guesses that don’t match measured data). Also the physicist through genius and wild guesses knows what accepted and “known to be true” equations are actually junk, retroactively working backwards and throwing out the now junk axioms that everyone else accepted as obviously true that they were based on. (Like Einstein throwing out absolute space and time coordinates).Now notably physicists intentionally still use those junk axioms and equations as “true” even through they are “untrue”, knowingly and being fully right to do so. This is because the old equations are not actually wrong, or right, they are just applicable at lower energies for example like Newton’s laws. You don’t avoid using Newton’s laws just because Einstein discovered relativity. That would be a typical engineers misconception that physicists just do fancier more detailed engineering calculations. You still use Newton at low energies. The newer more advanced theory works at yet higher energies and must mathematically reduce to the older equations at lower energies. You would be totally stupid to use relativity to solve how a basketball bounces off asphalt if there were no ultra high energies involved. Other things like air vortices and patterns of dirt on the rubber and asphalt would dominate. Interestingly it is not just a “hey just do a super powerful computer simulation with the fanciest equations” situation either, as the “real” laws of physics are not known and possibly not knowable if they are a holographic projection of laws of physics in a super space projected into our subspace for example. Those themselves could also be projections from beyond that superspace.There is no theoretical way to know if there isn’t yet another set of more advanced equations that goes to even higher energy. This concept is called UNIVERSALITY (apologies for the bold but it’s that important). But this is such an obscure high level concept that you may not find anything about it when you google search even though I just told you about it.

Instead of each bit begin either 0The intuitive butBeing in two states at once provides interesting possibilities for parallelism. Suppose you want to guess a 8-bit number, say an encryption key, that is a value of between 0 and 255. In a 8-bit digital computer, you have to try them all one by one. So, you start with the number 0 (8 zero-bits, or 00000000), then if that fails with the number 1 (7 zero bits and one one bit, or 00000001) etc. If the number you have to guess is 255 you have to do your operation 256 times, on average you have to do it 128 times.Now, suppose the number to guess (e.g. an encryption key, or the best route of a possible 256 routes for a delivery car to deliver all its packets) is 153, or “10011001” in binary. In a digital 8-bit computer you have to make 154 tries. But if your computer is a quantum computer, you start with one 8-qubit ‘superposition’, or “{0 or 1}{0 or 1}{0 or 1}{0 or 1}{0 or 1}{0 or 1}{0 or 1}{0 or 1}” and in one step, the computer finds the answer {0 orBut the story is wrong. There are several huge flies in the ointment.

The task of designing a quantum algorithm is to design the interference such that only the right solution is allowed.The property of interference that makes it powerful is that it uses the wave nature of quantum theory. That means that a small local change of one qubit can affect the entire output. That's the parallel part, except that it's not really parallel. It's nonlocal.Here's an example of how nonlocality can work to solve a very simple problem that you can't solve classically. There are two paths; the low road and the high road. They both lead to the same place, which is a house with two doors; a red door and a blue door. Behind one of the doors is a lot of money. Only one of the two roads has a coloured ticket that will tell you which door to open. So you have two choices: Take the high road or take the low road. Open the red door or open the blue door. Based on this information, you can work out the probability of opening the door with the money, but it's not one… but if you were a quantum particle it could be exactly one. That’s because a quantum particle can take both roads (that’s nonlocality) and interference will ensure that it opens the correct door every time.What you do want is a definite answer, so the output needs to be in a definite state. That's where quantum interference is so important. If the interference is just right, a quantum state can have a definite measurement value. That means the qubit will read like an ordinary bit after all the quantum computing is done. Like in the red door/blue door example, the computing has been done by the time the door opening decision needs to be made.Now take the two door problem and make it a one hundred door problem, with one hundred possible paths and only one ticket, the quantum interference effect will always give you the correct door and it won’t take any extra time to give the solution, even though you’ve increased the complexity by a significant factor.This is where you can see the significant speed up potential. In order to solve the problem classically, you’d need to travel down both paths in some cases, which increases the time. For one hundred paths, you’d need to take many of them on average to solve the problem. However, the quantum particle sees no difference between those two variants of the path problem and would take the same time to solve both.",941 followers,Nadh Poduri,5.5K,181,2.8M,https://www.quora.com/What-will-happen-if-an-astronaut-fires-a-gun-from-the-Moon-aiming-at-Earth

31,"Yes.When Rubik’s cube first came out, I played around with it a little, tested its mechanics a bit, and came up with what to me, remains the obvious and unassailable solution.I popped a corner peice off with a screwdriver, then quickly disassembled and reassemble it in the proper order. In 20 seconds, it was back together and solved.Why are you laughing? Why do people laugh? That’s not a joke.You might claim that the world record for a conventional solution is under 5 seconds, but that’s not really true. That’s solving it from a randomized starting point that happened to already be close to thYes.When Rubik’s cube first came out, I played around with it a little, tested its mechanics a bit, and came up with what to me, remains the obvious and unassailable solution.I popped a corner peice off with a screwdriver, then quickly disassembled and reassemble it in the proper order.

32,"Do you know this guy?That’s right. He is Feliks Zemdegs, one of the most famous and epic cubers of all time.Currently he holds the record for 3x3 through 6x6 solves, with an addition of the 3x3 one-handed, 5x5 and 6x6 average, and the 7x7 average.And guess what he uses to solve the cube? For every single type of cube he knows, which is more than I would be able to name?That’s right.If all those cube fans and humans out there were to think of algorithms as a cheat way of solving the cube, this guy wouldn’t be famous atDo you know this guy?That’s right.

He wouldn’t hold 8 world records. He would be viewed as a dirty cheater, banned from competitions, booed by people all over the world online and left to be forgotten.But he isn’t banned from competitions. It’s allowed by WCA. He isn’t viewed as a dirty cheater. Everybody thinks it’s fine. So what does your friend have against the use of algorithms?Or maybe let’s try a mathematical point of view.There are exactlyBut you ask “surely they can’t all be visibly different from each other? For example, if permutation A were to be just one more move from permutation B, wouldn’t A’s solution be only one move different from B’s?”And guess what; you are absolutely correct. As you try different scrambles and solve them, you’ll find that there is always a certain structure in a more efficient solve solution. Take the CFOP method as an example; It always begins with a cross. This is how an algorithm works.Algorithms are not out there to be used as a cheat method. Instead, they are out there to help you(You might have noticed how I especially highlighted the “easily”. This is because it is actually possible to solve the cube without algorithms. Instead, you could do what Google’s computers did: Generate a unique solution to every single possible combination. And remember them.)Edit: Just came back and noticed the number of upvotes for this answer… I really appreciate the support (this is my first time going over 50) and I’m also happy that you guys like my answer :D, I hope I can continue to improve my answers in the future.Edit 2: Holy",616 followers,Peter Hung,518,72,1.1M,https://www.quora.com/What-will-happen-if-an-astronaut-fires-a-gun-from-the-Moon-aiming-at-Earth
