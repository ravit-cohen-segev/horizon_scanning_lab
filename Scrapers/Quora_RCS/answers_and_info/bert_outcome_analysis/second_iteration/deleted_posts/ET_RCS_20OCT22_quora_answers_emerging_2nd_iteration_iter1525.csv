Address it to all of them, and if it's an email, CC everybody you want to have it at once. If you like, you may show more mature empathy by saying something like, “I believe that Ms. Smith should not have been in the classroom on xx/xx/xxxx due to what appeared to be a significant communicable illness. When I brought my concerns to her, I was only told to mind my own business. I don't appreciate the response, as I found it to be disrespectful towards my valid concerns about the spread of disease within the classroom. That said, when I was looking to become more educated on the issue, I was informed by others that sickness policies within most schools tend to be what is partially responsible for this frankly irresponsible mindset. I hope that this is not the case for our district. If it is, however, know that it is endangering us students, alongside your staff. I do not feel comfortable learning in an environment where I am forced to spend hours in a classroom with a teacher who will very likely make me ill, especially if that is due to school or district wide policy issues. I hope that if this is part of the problem, that our district may reassess any problematic policies in place. Thank you for your time and attention to what I feel is an urgent and valid health and safety issue in my school.”It may result in something. It may result in nothing. It depends on the maturity of the adults involved, and how seriously they take the issue. If you like, you could also send it as a Letter to the Editor of sorts to your local news papers, and make it public to your local community that you have addressed the issue at multiple levels.That all said, I have to be transparent. Could it get the teacher involved in pretty hot water? Yes. Could they try to use her as a scapegoat if it goes too public and folks get angry? Unfortunately, yes. Is that her problem to deal with? Some would disagree with me… but yes. Yes, it is. People make choices in this life. She chose to renew her teaching contract, despite the fact that she had to have known what the policies are and that they are unfair. Welcome to the current adult world of employment, unfortunately. We, as workers, have alarmingly few rights in the United States currently, which is another significant issue, but at a higher level, needless to say.But you, as the student and, likely, a minor to boot?Leave the adult problems and worries to the adults. Worry about doing whatever you need to do to maintain a safe environment for yourself.",3 followers,Jeff Nichols,1.5K,848,1.8M,https://www.quora.com/My-teacher-came-to-school-very-sick-with-the-flu-I-become-upset-and-told-her-that-it-is-unfair-for-her-to-come-to-school-sick-putting-us-all-at-risk-My-teacher-said-she-cant-afford-to-take-any-sick-days-and-to-mind
3,"My stepmom was a teacher for years, and she had 10 days off per year, period. Thats it. If one of is kids had a doctors appointment, she'd have to take off, or if she had a fever or if someone died. After those days were up, no matter what happened, she could not miss work or there was a good chance she would lose her job. When I turned 17 I had to start taking younger siblings to the doctor and missing school for it because she literally could not. If it makes you so mad, vote for someone who supports teachers rights.

5,She probably doesn't get paid sick days or has already used all the sick days she is allowed. I have been in the same position many times with no paid sick days and they only let you take so many days off before they fire you. I have many health problems and had to go to work even though I was sick. Some times if you take a couple days off to feel better you can't pay your bills or you lose your job. I have even been in the situation that if I didn't go to work I would not be able to pay rent and that employer went by a point system and I already had 3 points. 1 more point and I would be firedShe probably doesn't get paid sick days or has already used all the sick days she is allowed.

6,I understand both sides. It is horrible to be sick and need a job and not get paid if you are sick. Don’t take it out on the employee who is following the rules and economic leave. Raise hell with the employers to pay them when they are out sick and thus keep others safe.

You were so interested in Civil Services for the last 05 years and why are you suddenly shifting to the Corporate sector now ? Are you after money? Don’t you want to do govt service anymore or work for the public, that you have advocated so much for half a decade?II got an admit from the Indian School of Business, Hyderabad for their PGP Class of 2020.Many people have asked me why MBA right now? You were so interested in Civil Services for the last 05 years and why are you suddenly shifting to the Corporate sector now ? Are you after money? Don’t you want to do govt service anymore or work for the public, that you have advocated so much for half a decade?I have got a lot of accusations, of being money minded, this and that in the PMs in Quora.This is an answer to everyone, an answer which would describe my thought process in taking this particular decision.Before, starting with that, let us understand the structure of the Government’s Bureaucracy. That will help us have more clarity, in understanding my decision.The Government is divided into Levels, according to the 7th Central Pay Commission. There are totally 18 levels, with 03 entry points.Level 01 - 05 - Lower Services - Peons, Constables, Stenos, Clerks etc.Level 06 - 09 - Middle Services - Inspectors, Section Officers, DSPs, Block Officers etc.Level 10 - 18 - Upper Services - IAS, IPS, IRS, Undersecretary etc.Now, I have always aspired for the upper civil services, usually conducted by the UPSC, which deals with the upper management of the Government.This is where most of the “thinking” is done, this is where policies are “ideated” and this is where public policies are “drafted”.An IAS joins at Level 09 during training, and then starts off from Level 10, and has the possibility of having more than 07 promotions in his career of 35 years.This is where I wanted to be, join the bureaucracy, and then rise high enough to shape the policy-making. (Usually around Level 13 or so)Now, I have been working with the MHA for the last two years, at Level 07.This is the middle management services.This is where the policies which are “drafted” by the top echelons are “implemented” on-ground.Working in rural Bihar for the last 02 years, I have understood the exact ground realities, of where exactly it is going wrong, and how the policy drafting needs a bit change, by someone who has actual on-ground realistic experiences.But, a Level 07 employee can grow upto max of Level 10 or 11, where you start competing with junior IAS officers when you are about to retire. (Example Promoted SP vs IPS SP)So, in a span of 35 years, I will get only 3–5 promotions, and that too will be still stuck in middle management, and never reach the “ideation” and “policy-drafting” stages.So, how do I make a shift from “Policy Implementation” to “Policy Drafting” now? Which is where I really want to be.I am not able to clear the UPSC exam. I have tried.I am stuck in middle management, away from home, with an unstable life, mediocre salary, erratic transfers and postings, very few promotions and very slow career growth and strained personal relationships.If I get married to anyone soon, she would want to work in a city, which would again increase long distance and put more strain on the family.So, how do I make a shift from “Policy Implementation” to “Policy Drafting” considering all these factors?The answer came here - Lateral Entry from the Corporate - Lateral entry: Over 6,000 private sector specialists apply for 10 joint secretary posts in government [ https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/lateral-entry-over-6000-private-sector-specialists-apply-for-10-joint-secretary-posts-in-government/articleshow/65459546.cms ]And this privatization of the Government by bringing in external specialists is going to increase a lot in the next two decades or so.And they are getting Joint Secretary posts directly, which is a Level 15 post. A direct jump from Level 07 to Level 15, and if I stay I would retire by Level 10.I had to think.I had a plan.A long-term plan, with lots of risks and possibilities of failing.Get into the corporate sector.The lateral entry needs 15 years of total work-ex. I already have 05 years work-ex (Startup, Sabre and MHA)I need to work for 10 years, a decade in the corporate sector, after which I can make a shift to upper civil services - Level 15 in a very short time.And I have seen the 6000 applicants - Some are good, some are okay, not that stellar - I know my work ex in the Central Government in rural Bihar would stand out and would get a chance to interview for the Joint Secretary posts - This is 10 years later I am talking about - 2030 - When I am around 38 years old.So, how do I jump into the corporate sector?Some private job which deals with Public Policy or Development Consultancy or Social Impact or Public Administration jobs ?Also, I need a post-graduation, ensuring all the educational qualifications are in place.So, I made a list of colleges/schools/institutes which would ...","9,536 followers",Akshay Sirsalewala,524,188,7.8M,https://www.quora.com/My-teacher-came-to-school-very-sick-with-the-flu-I-become-upset-and-told-her-that-it-is-unfair-for-her-to-come-to-school-sick-putting-us-all-at-risk-My-teacher-said-she-cant-afford-to-take-any-sick-days-and-to-mind
