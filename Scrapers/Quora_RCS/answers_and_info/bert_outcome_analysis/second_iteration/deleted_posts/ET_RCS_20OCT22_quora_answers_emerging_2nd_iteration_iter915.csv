The photon and correlating photon from the other particle (which also originated from super symmetric space) exchange information. Since each unit of space is always “half super symmetric”, the photon when it was without mass can interact with each other. Not only 00/00 & 00/00 to 00/01 & 00/01 but this property of super symmetry could be 01/01 (new measure of super symmetry recorellation between fields) and 01/00 & 00/01 (quantum entanglement). The recorellation size of super symmetric space would appear as ———— to_________ in measure as the “weighted” photon returns in a new measure of “super symmetry”… gravitationally massive particles could also affect electrons at 0 creating a weakly interacting massive particle where quantum electron stasis occurs. A shunt in charge but the electron existing in 0-infinite other electrons. The stasis of information pauses the electrons information and later releases the information which creates quantum circuitry. This ability could allow one to manipulate events themselves while using the 01/01 “1” mode to foresee the future in information. It is quite possible that it might be a simulation.

Act 1 is pretty innocent and expected, it’s an anime-style dating simulator visual novel where you are welcomed into the literature club at your highschool by 4 beautiful anime girls- Sayori, Yuri, Monika and Natsuki.Sayori is your childhood friend and very upbeat and positive. She always puts a smile on people’s faces.Yuri is a more quiet, timid girl who loves reading and writing. Her poems are usually very symbolic and she tends to like darker themes.Monika is… just Monika. She’s the club president and seems nice enough but strangely, doesn’t get her own route.Natsuki is a small tsundere type girl who likes baking and cute things, though she’ll never admit it.Love these girls? Good! Now watch them all die horrible painful deaths.Sayori’s death is first. You learn one night that she has horrible depression and has had it her entire life. She only wants others to smile. You can confess your love to her if you so choose. The next morning, you decide to let her sleep and walk to school without her. After seeing Sayori’s newest poem, you realize you should probably go check on her.(Sayori’s latest poem, “Get Out of my Head”.You walk into her house to see her dead, hanging from the ceiling. Her lifeless body dangles and you, the main character, begin to panic seeing that your childhood friend has just killed herself.Since it’s a visual novel you can reset, right?Sayori is now out of the game and you enter act 2.I won’t go into… TOO much detail since I’m not sure what would be crossing the line on Quora here but basically it gets more and more twisted as you go along.Monika screws with Natsuki and Yuri’s files. They get more and more screwed up. 1/3 gameplays get the animation of Natsuki snapping her neck and running towards you with glitched eyes. Yuri becomes more and more obsessive, eventually confessing to you and stabbing herself repeatedly immediately afterwards.Then you can spend the weekend with a dead body.Fun.Eventually it’sMonika knows she’s in a game and wants only you.You end up having to delete Monika’s ‘file’ to end it all. Then you can replay the game with everyone BUT her. If you did everything correctly, Sayori will become self-aware and thank you for trying to make everyone happy.If not, she’ll become self-aware, go insane and try to take you for herself.The deeper you look into this game the worse it gets. It encourages the manipulation of files and leaves you petrified for days.Delete Monika before starting the game?Sayori becomes self-aware, goes insane, screams to “make it stop”, and hangs herself immediately.Delete Sayori before starting the game?No cutscene. Just hanging.The music also messes with you. Instruments get distorted or stop completely. When the music stops, you better prepare yourself cause something screwed up is going to happen.On the bright side, it ends with the credits playing an actually amazing song sung by Monika herself.So because of the music, story and incredibly graphic deaths, Doki Doki Literature Club is an insanely disturbing video game.*Big thanks to whoever suggested the edit (I forget the name, sorry!)",152 followers,Alex Mann,602,2K,102.2M,https://www.quora.com/Is-there-any-computing-faster-than-quantum-computing

At the same time, “Chin” has to dodge cars that ram into him.If you manage to survive the falling mainland Chinese, then you get to face “Tong Shau Ping” himself, whose head bounces around as “Chin” tries to avoid it.99.99% of the time, “Chin” comes into contact with either the little mainland Chinese or Tong Shau Ping, at which point he dies, you automatically lose the game, and Hong Kong succumbs to the “ugly reds.”The “game over” screen, featuring a guy who actually died on a certain day in 1992.Then you start over.All in all, there really is no game like Hong Kong 97.

PLATO was a network using dumb terminals connected to a mainframe. There were terminals all over the world, including Japan.THE BOSSGary and I created the Boss. Prior to dnd, you never “finished” a video game. For example, in Pong, the game did not have ending. The game sped up until the player could no longer keep up.Our initial version of the game never ended.

If you scored a high score, then you could enter you initials and your score would be displayed for the next player.We thought it would be great if our game had a high score feature…so players could show off their prowess in the game.We decided that the game should have a beginning, middle and ending.

Why are they in an entirely different genre?Here is what happened…Gary and I constructed the first 3D dungeon. We had a whopping 10 levels.The logical thing would be to put stairways connecting the levels. The main problem was that neither Gary nor I were artists. We couldn’t draw a decent looking stairwell. Additionally, we couldn’t figure a simple way to graphically connect the levels. So, we just abandoned the idea. We said, “Heck, put in transporters. We can assign a location for the transporter, and a destination. NO GRAPHICS!”SAVED GAMESOur game had the first save game function. So, you could play for a while. Leave the computer, come back the next day, and start over again.No game at that time had that functionality.

12,"This game, hands down.Why is it my top pick of the decade? Well for several reasons.Spoiler warning is in effectStory:This game, hands down.Why is it my top pick of the decade? Well for several reasons.Spoiler warning is in effectStory:The problem with “explain everything” is that it removes nuance and tends to turn people off if they interpret a situation differently than someone else. The biggest flub of this nature is the idea of the Midichlorians that was introduced to explain how the Force works in Star Wars. Did anyone get greater enjoyment at having the Force explained? Unlikely, and it caused a huge uproar because the new narrative direly clashed with the idea that the Force is not something that is meant to be quantified.If instead of this opening, we had a more common one where Kratos and the boy had some drummed up dialog about why they had to go and cut the tree played out in a lengthy expository speech, it would have left nothing for us to fill in. It would have been cut, dry and stale by the time we started chopping. Hopefully more games take a page from this book and return to more emotive storytelling.Revitalizing a Franchise Naturally:First off, they did away with the jumping mechanic entirely. Now you are a heavy slower footed third person action hero with an over the shoulder camera that is possibly too tight for the types of Close Quarter Combat that it employs. Your primary weapon for most of the game is an axe now instead of the Chaos Blades, but it still has some of the feel. This is thanks to the throwing mechanic giving you a ranged attack and several Runic Attacks that effectively replace a number of the combos that were standard to the franchise.Then you have the boy, who is your best friend in combat. He’s a support character done right; one that is purely support and rarely gets in trouble so that you don’t have to constantly babysit the guy who is supposed to be helping you. Another quality of life improvement is the removal of the MP bar in favor of timers and a cooldown system. This coupled with a rather large array of choices for both Runic Attacks and Charms makes it a much more interesting experience for someone like me who tends to horde MP until it is desperately needed, which is almost never.Not only did the combat evolve to a new form, but so did Kratos as a character, without having to eliminate the past games as is generally performed in a reboot. It feels natural, and gives Kratos more depth than a reboot where Kratos is basically subbed out for Tyr, a Norse god of war, ever could. Everything just feels right for old fans and new fans alike.Now compare that to the most egregious reboot in recent memory, DmC. Unlike GoW, the creators of DmC (Ninja Theory) openly and publicly stuck it’s middle finger up at the fans of the previous games when recreating Dante. The original Dante was smooth charismatic and stylish, the new one is a crude greasy punk. This wouldn’t be so bad, as a demon hunter he would probably fit the bill just fine, a la Shadows of the Damned’s Garcia Hotspur, but they went too far for most fans. What’s worse is that they then berated those fans for not liking the new direction they went. Thankfully that kind of bad action did not go unpunished and we now have Devil May Cry 5 coming out relatively soon with the old Dante back in proper form.Showing Positive and Flawed Male Role Models Right:This scene had me laughing pretty hard because it fit Kratos’ no nonsense attitude so well. The purpose of the hunt is to have the boy show what skills that he has acquired as Kratos has been away for much of the upbringing of the boy. Again, they never go into detail aboutNow some might say that this is an example of “Toxic Masculinity” because the kid’s mom had just died and shouldn’t we “allow boys to cry too”. To this I say that it does not fit the world that they live in nor the circumstances. The glade in which they lived was once protected by a magic spell, part of which involved the trees the mother specifically marked to be used in her funeral pyre. As such, they are no longer safe and will be set upon by gods and demons in relatively short order. There isn’t time to mourn and Kratos needs to ensure that his child can survive the harsh realities that are about to come battering down on their doorstep.As the quest moves on we see on three separate occasions where Kratos starts to reach out his hand to comfort the boy, but then pulls back, realizing that it is not the best option, or afraid that he is too tainted to offer any comfort to his grieving son. Again, without actually openly stating exactlySlowly, as the game progresses and the boy gains new moves and abilities, we hear the banter between them improve. Instead of Kratos saying that his moves are sloppy or bad, he starts to praise him little by little as he actually starts to deserve the praise. He goes from saying “that was sloppy” to “that was adequate” to “well done boy” over the course of the game. It’s a subtle but important element of character growth that plays out in the background. It’s crucial that it plays out in the background banter rather than being in your face with cut scenes and long shots (held long enough for us to acknowledge the shift in tone consciously), because it creates an environment rather than a set piece. Again this is a show, don’t tell improvement on storytelling. YouThe first time we see direct comfort from Kratos is right after the boy kills his first human. Kratos had explicitly forbade the boy from participating in fights with people, because he knew that killing a human is much different that killing an undead or an animal, both of which are necessary to survive. Killing another human is more personal and it is deeply impactful to a person, especially one as kind hearted and innocent as Atreus.This demonstrates how Kratos is not an unfeeling monster, but that he recognizes that there is a difference betweenThe last sequence that I will mention in this topic is when they are leaving Freya’s house after curing the boy and he overheard his father say that he was cursed. The boy misunderstands and thinks that Kratos believes the boy to be a curse, because he is weak. Once again, we see the moment when Kratos realizes that this too will break the boy if “Directly following this is another powerful moment where Kratos reveals his inner thoughts and the attempt to comfort the boy works well, possibly too well. Soon thereafter, the boy starts getting drunk on the idea of his godhood and enters an angsty phase of development that is strangely akin to puberty. More on this later.Evolving Characters:Atreus evolves as well. He starts off a timid child who is tortured by having to finish off a deer that he shot. As he learns and grows, we see a resentment of his father expose itself slowly at first. Little quips, such as a cruel statement that he loved his mother more than his father did because Kratos was never around begin to emerge as he becomes more comfortable around his father. This is harsh to listen to, but it shows the lack of understanding and maturity in the boy who honestly believes that his father didn’t care, even though he was likely fighting hard for their benefit back at home. Eventually, after Atreus learns of his godhood, he starts going into full rebellion mode.In the game this presents itself in a number of ways. First off, the boy starts literally ignoring your orders. You tell him to fire his arrow and he refuses to do so, unless it is at a necessary target to move forward. This is frustrating to both the player and to Kratos, because we have come to rely on his skills in combat. Again this embodies the essence of “Show, Don’t Tell”. The more subtle elements involve things like the boy no longer calling out to his father when he is dying and you have a Resurrection Stone. It’s another subtle point, but when it is gone, you actually notice its absence, which is a powerful tool that tugs at the player that realizes the kid is no longer upset that you lay there dying. Additionally the boy now walks far ahead of Kratos when not in combat, demonstrating his new, more independent nature. In combat he abuses his equipment, often beating his enemies with the body of the bow, rather than shooting them with arrows. Another important aspect of all of this is that the boy actually also becomes a more competent fighter, killing several enemies all on his own without help from dear old dad.The most important character shift though revolves around the boy’s treatment of others. He starts yelling at his father, as well as an undeserving Sindri, and pretty much anyone that he now sees as “lesser” than himself. This is done a bit ham handedly, though. What I liked about this phase is that his actions are pretty much what I would expect a child attempting to fill a role that has been thrust upon him. The way he talks about being a god is clearly influenced by stories of what the gods tended to do. Specifically, being selfish, violent, loud, angry, and looking down on other “lesser beings”. He no longer feels guilty for killing the Dark Elves, because he is a god doing “god things” which are more important than considering the lives of mere mortals. He is trying to fulfill the role of a god by looking down on mortals and believing that his will is now infinite and he can do whatever he wants.This could have been done more naturally in my opinion. The boy clearly had a rough time of it growing up, but then to realize that he has had great power all along should have been a liberating revelation that would have done better if it had a bit more time to properly evolve. As it stands, the boy suddenly turns into a punk out of the blue and then later on he turns back to a humble child almost as quickly. There was no time given for proper development or even a well presented reason why he went angsty or why he turned back to normal. The only interaction we have as explanation is the vision of himself killing Modi in Helheim. However, this happened immediately prior to the current stage of the story, and being reminded of actions he literally just took should not have that much of an impact on him. That is probably the weakest point of the character development in the game, thankfully it is relatively short.Witty writing:A Tale of Two Parents:Freya sought to protect her son rather than allow him to suffer and possibly die in the world. In doing so, she took away his ability to feel, and though he was now effectively immortal (even more so than your average god), he was bereft of joy and pain and utterly resentful of his mother for it. He didn’t want to be coddled, he wanted to live his life experiencing both the good and the bad.

It ended spawning several sequels, and is cherished as one of the greatest games by many nostalgia trippers looking to remember the early days of PC Gaming.Given the revenues of $30 million compared to the few thousand pounds spent developing it - and that it made Sawyer a millionaire and icon of the ’90s game industry- I'd say it has a fair shot of being one of the most profitable games ever developed, at least if the metric used is percent return on investment.",8 followers,Esteban Landes,711,0,0,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-ten-most-important-video-games-ever-made

This one pictured here consists of three main joints in the same way your arm does. It has a shoulder, an elbow and a wrist, and is programmed to accomplish a specific function.Now you might not consider cars to be robots, but if you look at the second definition, there are a ton of systems within your car that fit within that context - a good example of one is cruise control. Historically it accelerates up hills, maintains a constant speed, and gives your foot a rest on long road trips. All you have to do is keep it out of the ditch by steering it around corners and slower traffic. However, in some newer models your car will drive for you in a traffic jam, leaving your hands and feet completely free.Now you might not consider cars to be robots, but if you look at the second definition, there are a ton of systems within your car that fit within that context - a good example of one is cruise control.

He was quite strong in the view that we are killing jobs of receptionists, security personnel and so on.I told him politely that doctors like him have put most shamans, black magic healers and village medical practioners out of business. Is that not wrong? To make it worse, their science has removed many diseases and make it hard for other doctors to get business. Dammit you scientific people - destroyer of jobs!And the mother of all job killers in humanity was agriculture.A while ago, when we were exhibiting the Mitra robot at an event, a doctor walked up to me and broached on this subject.

Dammit you scientific people - destroyer of jobs!And the mother of all job killers in humanity was agriculture. General purpose AI and singularity would not even come near the “chaos” that agriculture created. Until 12000 years ago, ourThen these random dudes and dudettes come with their mastery of wild seeds. And before long, food production became a much easy thing. A single farmer in a few acres of land could produce more food than dozens of hunters attacking many square miles of forest. This gave rise to the “Instead of foraging and hunting, most people got involved in other things - like pottery, painting, urban planning, building homes & drainages, administration, mining, jewellery, accounting, medicine…A few thousand years later, another bunch of dudes would start harnessing the power of steam and create “nasty” things like locomotion. Rather than beating our horses to get to the next village, we would get to the other end of the continent reading newspapers. We moved around, explored things. Rather than using little children for many jobs such as chimney sweeping we kept finding better methods. Eventually the horse carriage workers and others moved on to other things.We often confuse general purpose AI with robotics.Let’s assume the worst case and we have a general purpose AI - that can do everything a human can. What would happen?It would be only as bad as agriculture - that destroyed most of what we did everyday. We could be doing things like sports. In most video games, bots are way better than humans. Does it mean we are less likely to play with other humans? In fact, we would play more with other humans just because the bots are better than us.We would do art, psychiatry and so many more human fields that we have not even created. Just like people could not imagine separate professions like art before the invention of agriculture, we have a problem with imagination.And we would spend more time with our children - who often grow alone with their TVs and more time with our parents - who often rot away alone.But, this is assuming there is a general purpose AI. Robotics is not the same as general purpose AI.Oh, what about movies like The Matrix and Terminator. Oh, you guys are now giving us Hollywood? If you believe in those weird movies, do you also believe in other dystopian movies like “I’m a legend”? In the latter movie, a germ gets out and wipes out most of humanity. Does it mean we have to close down the pharma and medicine industry?Hollywood can paint a dystopian picture from anything possible. They have even made something as harmless as vacuum cleaners into dangerous things. Should we stop doing all of them?In fact, anything useful can be made dangerous - think fire, water, air, cars, electricity, trains, medicines, petrol, sugar - any of them can kill you very easily.Anything that cannot kill you, is not of much use to you.Robotics, like any major revolution, can indeed cause chaos in the society. No different from agricultural revolution or industrial revolution. There will be displacement. People said the same for computing too. Could the people who were worried about computers doing spreadsheets in 1970s have thought about the whole new industries created by computing 40 years later?But, there are a whole set of important things that are not effectively today and we need robots there. Let me give you some examples of these:It need not always be life threatening. You walk into most stores now, and it hard to find anyone to assist you. The robots could walk with you, understand your requirements, help you shop and get things on your vehicle. It could play football with your children and take them off TV.I could give you 100s of such examples and that is the future. But, to get there we have to have more simpler robots doing more mundane things. A baby has to go through the toddler stage before becoming an adult.40 years ago, your parents would not have imagined what you do with computers. They could not have thought of the kind of revolutionary applications that we take for granted.A new revolution is beckoning us.
