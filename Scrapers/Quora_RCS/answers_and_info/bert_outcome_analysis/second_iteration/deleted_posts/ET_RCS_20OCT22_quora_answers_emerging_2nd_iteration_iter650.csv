I will use this equation later.I’ll now introduce you to a basic definition of what a Tensor really is…Tensors are objects which have individually indexed parts, called components. Regular old numbers are a type of tensor (called rank-0 tensors, no index) and the vectors from high school physics are also a type of tensor (called rank-1 tensors, one index per component).A rank 2 tensor, simply put, is a relationship between 2 vectors such that if it equals a specific value in one frame of reference, then it should have the same specific value in all frames of reference!I’m sure you must have come across the Pythagoras Theorem at some point in your life.

I’ll try to explain the physical intuition behind metric tensor.Every country has its own metric to measure money and this decides the cost of your living, like USA measure in dollars, UK -pound, India -Rupees, Japanese - yen. I mean they have their own metric space.Hence, a 1 kg rice will cost 44 Rs in India, whereas in US it would cost 256 Rs, and McMeal at McDonalds (or Equivalent ) cost 250 in India and 456 in US. Rent prices cost 479.28% higher than India. This happens because every country has its own metric tensor. Think, what would have happen if all of them had same metric?Similarly, every point in CO- ordinate system has its own metric tensor. We don’t care about this usually because our Euclidean co-ordinate system has same metric tensor everywhere. In advance physics or mathematics, we have to deal with non -Euclidean spaces with varying metric tensor at every point. So let’s understand how this works..How will you calculate distance between two points or angle between two vector on plane or in Euclidean space?Its simple, we apply Euclidean geometry right? we measure dx and dy, use Pythagoras to compute the distance, similarly using dot product I can compute angle. Now, how will you measure distance between two points or angle on a sphere, or Earth or any complex surface like teddy bear. Its really difficult because we can’t apply our Euclidean geometry here.In order to do that let us solve these…Let us assume I’ve a rubber sheet , if I draw two points on this sheet, then what is the distance between two points. Its just Euclidean distance.(dr)^2 = (dx)^2 + (dy)^2;Assume, I’ve stretch the rubber sheet in x – direction by 2 times, now the distance will be…(dr)^2 = (2dx)^2 + (dy)^2;If I stretch the rubber sheet in y – direction by 2 times, now the distance will be..(dr)^2 = (dx)^2 + (2dy)^2;If I stretch the rubber sheet in both y and x – direction by 2 and 3 times respectively, now the distance between the points will be.(dr)^2 = (2dx)^2 + (3dy)^2;What if I stretch the same sheet in some random direction. Now, the distance between the points is not same as before. How to relate the unstretched distance to stretched distance.What If sheets are stretched in any random directions uniformly. Then the distance will be(dr)^2 =g11(dx)^2 +(g12+g21)(dxdy)^2 +g22(dy)^2Hence, the whole stretching information is captured by these co-efficients (g11,g12,g21,g22).And this stretching information is stored in efficient data structure i.e tensor, which is called Metric Tensor.A tensor is just a mathematical object to store data (data structure in maths) 0th rank tensor is scalar, 1st rank tensor is vector, 2nd rank tensor is matrix…etc. Time is stored in scalar, force is stored in vector, metric space is represented by 2nd order tensor. Similarly, Einstein uses 4th order tensors to store space -time curvature information.Hence, if I know by how much and in which direction my sheet is stretched, I can easily calculate the distance between two points. In other words, If I know the metric tensor of stretched sheet, I can compute the distance between any two points by equation(dr)^2 =g11(dx)^2 +(g12+g21)(dxdy)^2 +g22(dy)^2What is the use of these Metric Tensor (Stretching info of Euclidean planes)? So lets go back to our original problem, how to calculate distance between two points on any complex surfaces.Let us consider two points on sphere (surface can be anything like bottle, doll or any complex surface). Imagine, you take a rubber sheet and stretch it however you want to approximate the spherical surface, so that original shape of sphere is not lost and paste it (Note I use rubber patches because I can deform it however I want to approximate any surface). and note the stretching information i.e Metric Tensor (i.e g11,g12,g21,g22). Now, draw a line between those two points on rubber sheet and remove that rubber sheet.Now as rubber sheet goes back to its original unstretched state, I can get (dx,dy) on my rubber sheet. So, now I’ve dx, dy, and (g11,g12,g21,g22) stretched information (Metric Tensor) which I had noted. So, I can compute distance between those two points on surface using Equation:(dr)^2 = g11(dx)^2 + g12(dxdy)+g21(dydx)+g22(dy)^2;Hence, I can approximate any complex surface better by increasing these rubber patches (deformable Euclidean spaces). Ideally any surface is 100% approximated by infinite patches (Riemannian Manifolds). And every patch has its stretching info(metric_tensor). As I know the stretching information of all sheet, now I can compute the distance between any two point on any complex surface by simple summation, which is nothing but Geo_desic distance. Even angle between any two vectors can be computed using metric tensor.Hence, the whole surface information is captured by these little patches via space stretching information which is called Metric Tensor.Metric Tensor of sphere isThis means in order to approximate surface of radius (R) by patch at particular point (x,y,z) or (R,theta,phi) in spherical co-ordinates, I have to stretch my rubber sheet R^2 times in x direction and R^2sin(tetha) times in y direction. You can observe how unit distance on rubber sheet varies at different position on sphere when approximated by these rubber sheets. Similarly, any complex surface will have its own metric tensors (stretching information) as function of position on surface. This kind of patch approximation of surfaces enables us to compute angles and distances very easily on any complex surfaces.Generalization to N dimensional non Euclidean spaces.Nash embedding theorem says, We can approximate any complex M dimensional surfaces (manifolds) with (M-1) dimensional Euclidean spaces (here 3D sphere was approximated by 2D rubber sheet patches) by stretching it. And every point on this N-manifold has its own metric tensor (patch stretching info). This Euclidean approximation enables us to use our Euclidean geometry on non- Euclidean spaces like Riemannian manifolds.Note: every point in co-ordinate system (Euclidean, polar, any Einstein space-time, any surface) has its own vector space. And every vector space has its own metric space(metric tensor). This metric enables us to compute distance, area,angle or volume in that space. Without metric tensor, we can't measure anything in space. In Euclidean co-ordinate system, every point has same vector space, hence metric remains same all over the space. But complex surfaces have variable vector space, hence metric changes with position.Metric Tensor of 3D Euclidean space….This shows that the space is un-stretched at any point of space.Metric Tensor of non – Euclidean N dimensional space, the stretching of space is function of position.Hence, any complex M-dimensional surfaces information can be captured by these Metric Tensor. This enables us to introduce concept of distance, angles and areas on N-d complex Manifolds.",2 followers,Richard Muller,994,2.3K,201.9M,https://www.quora.com/What-is-a-metric-tensor

That’s hard because it’s a complex, deep idea. Skip to the very end for that answer.I’ll try to build to the answer—but I’m afraid it won’t be in “layman’s terms”. This should be roughly accessible to an American high school student.Let’s break the phrase down:> “metric”tl;dr: a “metric” is some general way to measure distance.Effectively, “metric” refers to some way of measuring something. Feel free to substitute the word “distance”!Except… it’s not just distance. It’s a way of measuring distance. So use phrase “distance measuring stick”.Ehhh, that’s messy. Use the phrase “distance measure”.Buuuut, the word “measure” means something specific in mathematics. So, let’s not use that.The word “metric” is really deep in our language, going waaaaaay back as referring to just a way to measure something. It doesn’t mean anything specific way to do it—unless you specify what it is.What’s the metric for success on Wall Street? Money, and more of it.When we talk about a metric here, we’re just talking about some kind of process for measuring something.What's the distance between 10 and 7?To find it, you subtract. (A verb…) The process of doing this is called… subtraction (a noun). Why I'm calling it a noun and verb will be mentioned later.What’s the metric for winning an archery contest? Measuring the distance to the bullseye. (… actually, in math… this would be the “Pythagorean metric”)How many blocks until the New York Public Library? Go 8 blocks (… actually, in math, this way of measuring this is often called the “taxi cab metric”.)Simple enough? “Metric” just means “a way of measuring distance”. And there are different ways to measure distance.I’ve repeated this so many times now, let’s pretend it’s true.> “tensor”tl;dr: a tensor is a mathematical object. It’s a “hyper-matrix”.This is where it gets confusing. So, I’ll just tell lead in to what a tensor is. And you need… to really relax your brain a bit.In English, you’re used to making sentences like noun + verb. “Bob jumps.” An object. And a doing of something.Math is exactly the same. We do this over-and-over-and-over again. But math, we’re just SUPER-specific about what the noun is. And what the verb can be.In math, we often deal with numbers. So, numbers are a kind of “mathematical object”. A kind noun.And numbers are a mathematical object that you already know what you can do to them. Like “add”. That’s a verb.But numbers aren’t the only mathematical nouns. There are quite a few.We can have many numbers, and these numbers collected together are a set. This is one of the most general ideas about how to arrange numbers.AWe don’t really know how to “add” sets of numbers together. There’s not a good verb for “add”-ing sets.Now, some math nerds will say to me, “That’s not true. You can join them together.”OH?! Is that what “add” means?See mathematicians are just like your grammar teacher. They're precise. They say what they mean. Not something else.You could invent a way to “add” sets. But generally, there just isn’t one right way to do that.We can also arrange some simple numbers in pairs. Sometimes we call those points, like (x,y).But… what can you do with that? Can you do anything to it? How do you add two points? Like sets, there’s no right answer.But we can give certain points a verb (like “add”), and call the pair of points a vector. And that basically means, it’s not just a point, the point represents “pointing”—verbing—in some direction. Sometimes, when we want to represent a vector, we write a little arrow over it. Boop!So, you can actually take a pointAnd now know we know, that when we add these pairs we add each number pair-wise:(How was the magically divined? Because that satisfies one of the definitions of a vector. Which… is a separate discussion.)Now, we can also arrange numbers into rectangles, and we call that a matrix.(Now, each number in a matrix is… well, a number. But if you look at any column of a matrix… well, you can “pull out” that whole column and call it a vector. Or, you can pull out a row of a matrix… and call that… a vector too!My point is this: This is all really, super flexible! I can do almost anything to these objects. As long as I can communicate to you, what I’m doing.And now stuff gets weird. With matrices, the lines between noun and verb start to get blurry. Because a matrix itself is a noun.But that noun can also be treated as representing a verb. A matrix is a bunch of numbers like above. But a matrix can also represent the process of doing something. Verbing.How? It's beyond the answer. But if I read the matrix in a certain way, it's like a computer program. A program is a thing. But it's a think that does something too.So what in the world does all this build-up have to do with a tensor?A tensor is yet another type of mathematical noun.You noticed so far, we started with numbers.And we collected them into vectors.And then we collected those vectors into a matrix.A tensor is the next step up.In fact, a matrix is a simple type of tensor.But why would you want to do that? Well, there are lots of reasons. But, they’re a bit beyond this. Just know, that a tensor is a type of mathematical noun… that also represent a verb.So what is a “metric tensor”?A metric tensor is a mathematical object that tells you how to measure distance… in some place.What any particular metric tensor is… will depend on what place you’re in!If you’re standing on a plane (which is infinitely flat), you’re going to measure distance differently than if you lived on a planet (which is curved).You...",UNKNOWN,Charles S.,1.2K,6.7K,39.2M,https://www.quora.com/What-is-a-metric-tensor

HoweveVery interesting question, let me try to answer it.Let me ask one question first:Why is it that China is not worried that the West will scold China for its system on diplomatic occasions? Even from a certain point of view, China is more willing to tangle with the West on these issues?Warning: This answer is very very long!I am Chinese, and I certainly hope foreigners will be friendly to me. However, if I were a foreigner, I wouldn't like China either. It's like a group of people competing for entertainment, but China is a professional athlete, and participating in the competition is not for entertainment, but only for gold medals.The greatest contribution of the Communist Party of China lies in organizing more than one billion Chinese people and forming an extremely horrible national system.Western countries once had a national system, that is, during World War II. During the World War, we saw the super industrial power and extremely powerful war potential under the American national system. However, once the western countries enter the era of peace, they will automatically give up the national system. The Western democratic system can avoid centralization, but centralization itself is a neutral word. If centralization does one thing, it is a highly efficient model.China is a centralized political model, and at the same time, it does one thing in the way of a nationwide system, that is, it develops its economy and consolidates its national defense. What western democratic system needs to be promoted in several years may only take months or even weeks in China. And the strong mobilization ability of the Communist Party will make this model play to the extreme.So, what worries will China bring to other countries?We believe that economic factors are always the basic reasons. Western countries attack Russia in public opinion because Russia's military strength makes them feel insecure. Western countries attacked Japan in the 1960s because Japan recovered rapidly after the war and its economy developed rapidly. Today, the most basic reason why western countries attack China is still the economy.As an ally of the United States, Japan is hostile at the stage of rapid economic development.Western media call China ""the crusher of developed countries"". Indeed, in the 40 years of China's reform and opening up, almost all industries have grown from scratch, such as household appliances, communications, security, photovoltaics, high-speed rail, nuclear power, and so on. Economic development in western countries is generally due to the independent leadership of enterprises. However, China is different. Apart from the independent leadership of enterprises, the Communist Party is constantly improving the industries behind it and actively guiding it.* First, the comprehensiveness of China's industry leads China to compete with all developed countries.Western civilization and Japanese civilization have a total population of one billion, which is not as large as China. As far as a single country is concerned, its population cannot support a comprehensive industry. Therefore, the industrial system of developed countries is divided among many developed countries. None of the developed countries in the world, including the US, Japan, and Germany, has comprehensive industries.Chinese industry is the whole industrial chain. What is the concept of this whole industrial chain?Take the United States, there are no LCD panel industry, high-speed rail industry, lithium battery industry, etc. In the United States, only military shipbuilding is left in the shipbuilding industry, and civilian shipbuilding has basically withdrawn from the competition in the world market. The United States buys European cruise ships and Asian merchant ships. Because of this, the cost of American warships is extremely high, and shipyards have no civilian orders, so they all rely on the navy to support them. Why is the US military spending so high, and a considerable part of them are wasted like this? Why does Trump want manufacturing to return? Because manufacturing is the skeleton of a country, losing manufacturing will cause restrictions everywhere.In Germany, for example, there are basically no industries such as smartphones, notebook computers, tablet computers, chip manufacturing and packaging, LCD panels, aero engines, and the Internet, and there is no independent aerospace industry in Germany.In Japan, for example, satellite navigation, civil aircraft, aero-engine, smartphone chip design, communication equipment, unmanned aerial vehicle, and Internet are basically absent or very weak, and the aerospace industry has no global space mapping network, manned space flight and space station.Another example is the military industry, which is dominated by the United States. Aircraft carriers, fourth-generation aircraft, supersonic aircraft, unmanned aerial vehicles, intercontinental missiles, phased array radar destroyers, and nuclear submarines, which are the main battle weapons, have no independent design and manufacturing capacity in Germany and Japan.As for China, the above-mentioned dozens of industries are not only all available, but also not bad.In addition to these high-tech manufacturing industries, toys, clothing, furniture, cement, glass, textiles, and other industries with relatively low technical requirements, the developed countries such as the United States, Japan, and Germany have long given up, while China still takes everything, and accounts for more than half of the world's share.* Second, the Chinese industry is not only a comprehensive all-round player but also can enter the top five in almost all industries, many of which are the top three in the world and the first in the world.For example, in Internet and satellite navigation, only China and the United States are exploring and practicing on a large scale, and China ranks second in the world, ahead of Europe and Japan.Another example is cloud computing, big data, and artificial intelligence. China is also closely following the United States with Ali, Huawei, Tencent, Xunfei, and Baidu. Taking cloud computing as an example, according to the report released by Deutsche Bank in May 2016, the top three in the world are Amazon, Microsoft, and Alibaba in China. Besides Alibaba Cloud, China also has Tencent Cloud, Baidu Cloud, Huawei Cloud, and so on, which are also ahead of Europe and Japan.For example, smartphones and tablet computers, China, the United States, and South Korea have monopolized the world market, and China ranks at least third in the world. The world share of China's mobile phone brands is expected to exceed 50% in 2017.Another example is the shipbuilding industry. The top three countries in the world are China, Japan, and South Korea, with China's share ranking first.Another example is the military industry. China, the United States, Russia, Britain, and France are among the top five countries in the world. In fact, China is the only country that can fully compete with the United States in terms of military expenditure and main battle weapons.Another example is household appliances. China, South Korea, and Europe occupy the major share of the world. Another example is the communication equipment industry. Huawei ZTE ranks first in the world in terms of technical level, output value, and profit. For civil drones, DJI ranks first in the world in terms of technology and output value and profit.Another example is offshore engineering equipment, namely offshore oil drilling platforms, and offshore engineering ships. The global market is dominated by China, South Korea, and Singapore, with China accounting for 35% of the global share, ranking first in the world. In 2015, more than 80% of the global drilling platforms were made in China. The United States, Europe, and Japan have little share of offshore equipment, while China mainly competes with South Korea and Singapore.China is not only everywhere, but also basically in the top five in the world.The integrated circuit industry is the most backward big industry in China, with the United States, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Germany, and the Netherlands ahead, and China ranks seventh in the world, still within the top eight. However, Trump authorities banned chip trade with China. The Communist Party of China began to vigorously promote this super project, and Chinese entrepreneurs joined in one after another. In order to avoid the shortage of chips delaying China's 5G plan, China has implemented the functions of chips in the cloud. That is, the calculation that was originally done with chips is now replaced by cloud computing.* Third, with the whole industrial chain competing with developed countries, China's industry is still growing at a high speed, while developed countries have already stagnated.In terms of gross output value, China's industrial output value in 2015 was already the sum of the United States and Japan, while China's industrial outp...",52 followers,David Levy,887,293,1.9M,https://www.quora.com/What-is-a-metric-tensor

That means they cannot settle for merely implementing democracy at home. They must compel every nation on earth to adopt democracy as well, whether their people want it or not.As Ann Coulter put it bluntly,“We should invade their countries, kill their leaders and convert them to Christianity. We weren't punctilious about locating and punishing only Hitler and his top officers. We carpet-bombed German cities; we killed civilians. That's war. And this is war.”Ironically, so-called “Islamo-fascists” see the world in exactly the same way. As champions of Sharia Law see it, their mission in life is to “make the world safe for Islam”. That means they cannot settle for merely implementing Islam at home. They must compel every nation on earth to adopt Islam as well, whether their people want it or not.China refuses to adopt US style democracy. It is going its own way. China has no desire to impose its system on the rest of the world. It is content to let others take different paths. It is willing to live and let live.But for Neocon/Neolib champions of democracy, that is not good enough. That is unacceptable. To them, US style democracy is the only right and just system in the world, and therefore must prevail everywhere, not just in the West.The Necon/Neolib ruling elites of the Anglo-American Empire, would love nothing better than to invade their countries, kill their leaders, and convert them to democracy.In fact, they have done just that, to Iraq, Libya, and are attempting to do that to Syria as well.They have been unable to do that to China (and Russia). Hence their hatred of China (and Russia).",0 followers,Mia Brown,1K,644,13.6M,https://www.quora.com/Why-does-the-Western-world-treat-China-unfriendly

One of my friends is stuck in Vietnam, and he also happy about no election drama in Vietnam.4. Live peacefully: I have always been against gun violence. You can’t have guns in China.5. Illegal Immigration: You can’t enter China illegally. You will be caught, and repatriated (after serving the sentence, of course), and would never be allowed to enter China.6.

This setting satisfies the PC for putting black into the scene without “breaking the heart” of the white audiences by making black females dating white males.As for Asian, they can become either kungfu/ninja masters or nerds. And somehow all of sudden the film directors are “feminists” that they wanna “empower” women so it likely to end up with Asian female actor being cool and independent and powerful, almost like Asian males are weak and can’t handle anything so the women have to come up. Strangely, they return to patriarchy and no longer “empower” women when it comes to white females. Again, it’s like I can welcome you to our film for racial harmony and equality, but you can’t “overact” to take the white man’s leadership.Not only in the films and TV shows but also in games, music and fashion that, when it comes to white, it’s always normal and universal and common sensed standard. But when it comes to Asian specifically, it’s always some kinda “distinct” and “unique” setups that all of sudden it’s all about diversity rather than universalism. Black is once again luckier than Asian in this case for the former can be more universal than the latter.Therefore, there is an identity card here for every group. You will be included and “helped” for my moral superiority, but don’t expect to take the lead. In this case, every group is complementary for the white and the West.But once you switch it, and let’s say that the American audiences have to sit down in the film theater to watch English subtitle and someone else being the “Captain” to save the world, then all of sudden they don’t “get used” to it. because you are substituting them.To imply that, you would understand that why Russia is always the bad guy while the East European Slavic countries are good, and why China is evil but all the countries nearby are one way or another “important” for the West. For the West, it’s all coincidences that it just happens that way and the enemies are randomly distributed.

The West tried to exploit the riches of China (opium wars) and ultimately failed.Western governments are also prejudiced against anyone not as white as them. It’s why African and Middle Eastern countries still struggle to completely rid themselves of our presence. But China was different.Now we just seek to “spread Democracy” all over the place instead of colonize countries. But we invade, make them like us, leave them in worse shape and sometimes leave…But we can’t do that to China.So what happens is, from the time children start learning history or current events in school, China is painted as the big, bad communists. We become adults and anytime China is mentioned in the news it’s negative. The news media portrays China as dangerous communists who want to invade and take over America. It is nothing but a steady diet of fear, hate, racism, lies and propaganda.No one takes time to discover that China’s communism is different than “classic” Marxism. Deng Xiaoping introduced different ways of doing things. China has its own type of Communism and it seems to work very well for China.Children aren’t born knowing how to hate. Western children aren’t born hating Chinese people. But they are taught to fear and hate. At best they’re taught to be kind to Chinese people but hate the Chinese government, having no idea that the CCP is so much a part of China’s present culture that hating the CCP is almost synonymous with hating China. I was raised in this system. I know it well. And it’s not better today, when our governments are trying to provoke China to strike.If they can’t provoke China to war, they may eventually stage a false flag event blaming China as an excuse to “counter attack.” I absolutely can foresee this happening if they want a fight bad enough.I do not hate China or the CCP. I love the Chinese people. I love China’s history and culture. I think President Xi is an exemplary statesman. But I had to dig for truth on my on.

One is under the banner of democracy.This is their most deceptive way, because in a country like China, some people, especially those who have never been to the United States, are easily affected by this so-called democratic view. Confused. In fact, first, the United States is not democratic, and democracy is relative. Second, whether the Americans or Europeans, they basically want democracy in China. If China is now democratic like Europe and the United States, maybe Europe and America will not exist. At that time, there was only one country in the world: China! Therefore, don’t believe their so-called democracy. Their purpose is nothing more than messing up China. To put it bluntly, they are now very jealous of China’s economic development and admire China’s large market and need China’s large consumption power. , This is their real purpose. In terms of economic construction, as a big country, it is normal for China to gradually rise under the condition of normal political and economic development, but the world is such a big place, there are so many businesses, and the cake is limited, so you will naturally share more of your rise. , Then some people must eat less.What's more, with the adjustment of my country's industry, there are fewer and fewer economic models for extracting resources from our country. The United States, Japan and other countries rely on gold dollars for our non-renewable resources. The rest is to rely on US dollars to buy our high labor value-added products.In this way, for the United States and other Western developed countries, a huge and irreversible trade deficit has been formed.

Their WeChat groups feeds are full of media that validate the “China sucks” narrative; videos, photos, stories, and memes featuring Chinese people driving badly, being rude tourists, assaulting or cheating foreigners, littering, spitting, etc. Also there are stories of Chinese cops or other officials harassing expats.Anyway, if you find a group of successful and mature westerners in China, they are unlikely to dislike the place.

This is likely due to the constant stream of disinformation about China and its activities. You have to understand that China’s economic and military ascension is a scary thing. For the past 100 (?) years the western counties have ruled the world economy— that looks like it’s come to an end. It’s hard to adjust.Take just one example: the South China Sea “dispute”. If you look at it from a Chinese perspective, it’s perfectly natural that China should carve out it’s own portion of the SCS. Everyone else has been doing it for decades and no one complained. In addition, look at how many US military installations are arrayed along China’s coast, between Taiwan and Vladivostok. And with the US and Vietnam getting more friendly with one another, it makes sense that China should reserve it’s own space.OK. That’s the a reasonable China perspective. But if you’re in the US, you may not even know, or may not notice, that the US has stationed itself across China’s doorstep and outside it’s backyard fence. You almost certainly don’t know that SE Asian countries have been claiming parts of the SCS for years.

THE SECOND PHOTO IS AN UPDATE FROM AUGUST 10th 2019, JUST SO YOU ALL CAN SEE I’M STILL THE WORLD’S PUNCHING BAG.But let’s start from the beginning.09SEP1959 Born with my umbilical cord wrapped around my neck. Blood drained from my brain, end result cerebral palsy. Scar#1, more like a dent above my right eye.Never mind the accidents that just about everyone has when they are growing up. The big event was 18MAR1989, when I was hit by a car and then slammed into a parked bus. Both bones in my left arm poking out of the skin of my forearm and I had contusions in my brain. So my arm stayed separated for 16 days, and they operated when my contusions were gone.I had metal plates in my arm and they broke. I have CP on my right side, so my left arm HAD to be fixed. All together there were seven operations and I had my arm in various casts for 291 days.What my arm looked like after the plates broke.I always forget about what my knee looked like after I was hit by the car.If you ever have your arm in a contraption like this, filled with ice, you’ll want to scream. Fire and ice. The final option was to leave part of my ulna missing and put a chunk of my right hip bone into my left arm. I was given Demoral every 90 minutes. When it wore off it was like having my arm submerged in cold water with someone using a hot poker to peel off layers of my skin.Oh. In 1983, I cut open my knee riding an exercise bike.. Twelve stitches. I’m prone to spasms and I often hit my head against the (unfortunately) brick wall as I let the dog out in winter or leave the house.In 2005, I spasmed in the shower and tore off a layer of skin (true, the area never tans) when my head hit the metal soap dish. Luckily, the glass door swung open, but I fell down and hit my head on the toilet bowl. And yet, here I am.This is the end result of a spasm. In this photo, you can sort of see the blue lines converge. That is where my skull was drilled into after I was born.Caught my foot under one of those subway stalls last winter. I was visiting a friend who had cancer, and never really felt the pain until I left the hospital, and I was unable to get my gym shoe off. All is well again.Long story to this one. Funny how when I’m injured I always have stubble like I’m a bum. The best scar is the one I got in my crawlspace. I had a spasm and slammed my head into an I-beam and knocked myself out. Here is the dent.Hard taking photos from straight above your head, but there’s my new dent.“Baptized in danger of death.” Silly Polish Roman Catholic priests. There’s a burn on my arm from scalding water, cuts behind my right ear, a small cut near my eye after I was punched getting mugged. Etc. Etc.If you see somebody on the street that looks like this, odds are it is me.UPDATE: new scar as of yesterday, 09JUN16.Had a spasm at the wrong time while in the gym locker room, my locker was open and bammo, I knocked the door off it’s hinges.","4,668 followers",Wayne Allen Sallee,2.9K,3.4K,27.2M,https://www.quora.com/What-is-a-metric-tensor

My friends like to hold up magazine articles and ask me to read them from across the room…. I have tormented my optometrist by reading the bottom lines on the vision test first.It runs in the family.

Hey, I’m human.There was a guy looking at a guitar shop. He was staring at it for a while and he seemed a bit sad. I have seen this guy a few times.I one day walked into shop and he was standing out side again, staring at this one guitar. I walked outside and I asked..“Hey man, good guitar isn’t it?”I heard two voices in my head.One voice saying, “don’t you do it. You saved for a guitar for ages. You got to do those gigs. Don’t do it.”And another voice, saying, “You will be ok. You’re a super hero.”I walked into shop, bought the guitar and saw the sadness as the guy went to get the guitar from the window.I walked out and gave him the guitar with..“Now you can sing to your dad and everyone else. have a nice day” and walked away.One voice saying “are you nuts! Crazy! Stop doing this shit.”And other voice said, “feels good, doesn’t it?”The other time, is when I was at a record studio and a group of guys and girls were there, asking how much to book studio.The guy said “£560 for a full day.”Their heart sank. They looked to each other and then asked a guy..“Is there a studio where we can do a demo for £100? That’s all we got?”But no. The city is filled with recording studios and long gone are the studios that use to help communities to do that due to cutting taxes etc. Lots of organisations gone for these young guys and girls.As they walked out, and girls saying “I knew it be more. Shit!”The other guys feeling down as their coolness hit rock bottom, I talked to the engineer, and he went down the steps and…“Hey, wait a minute.”They stopped…“We just had a cancellation and we’ll lose money, so you can get 6 hours for £100 and…you’ll get very good engineer.”I saw smiles on their faces when they walked back up and into the reception. They couldn’t believe it. I can feel their excitement. The girls jumping a bit and smiling, and the guys we’re like - ‘Yeah man, we’re cool. We got this!’I don’t know. I just felt like they were my bros and sisters. Sure, different race, colour, white british but I saw them like my family, which is what the human race is. Family.He took them to studio room and it’s massive. He introduced them to the engineer, came back and I paid the man for the full day studio discreetly.One voice in my head. “you’re fucking crazy!The other, “it feels good, doesn’t it?”So my life has been like that. I am not rich. I am not poor. I am just an ordinary guy, with a super power to give more.Sometimes, to even letting my dream down a little, so I can see others get a chance.My girl friends I date see me do this too and they always say, “you give to much, what about you?”I know, time is running short, my dreams need somethings I need to do but I realised, my dream was always to inspire with my art, music, knowledge, expertise, and say “be brave, just go for it, do it for the feeling.”So in a sense, I got my dream.Not in way I imagines, you know, me being a billionnaire, signing checks, flying all over to help, without anyone kind of knowing, but hey, it’s something.I know it might not change anything in world.I might not even make a dent.But I sometimes wonder about the guy who got the guitar, the girl who got her violin, the guy who got the job due to some crazy moves I did, the artists who wanted to record a demo, and many more…and think…maybe..they don’t see the world as bad as they thought it be.I don’t know and I suppose I will never know.All I know is I have an awesome super power where I can give in the most desperate times of my life, when I am in need, and feel good about it because it comes from a real place.

She has a unique mutation called a “tetrachromat,” in which mutations on both her X chromosomes led to extra cones in her eyes, giving her enhanced vision, and even cooler, enhanced color detection.She reportedly can see and distinguish about nine million different colors, most of which are “invisible colors,” meaning that almost no other humans can perceive them. She reportedly views everyday objects such as rocks and pebbles as vibrant displays of rainbow-like colors popping out at her, and can see pinks, oranges, yellows, reds, and blues across the surface of a road.Enhanced Stomach LiningThis one’s definitely one of the weirder superpowers. A French comedian named Michel Lotito regularly shocked audiences by consuming all sorts of objects and having no adverse reactions afterward.He has eaten all of the following: 18 bicycles, 15 supermarket trolleys, seven TV sets, six chandeliers, two beds, a pair of skis, a computer, and even a plane.After further research, doctors concluded that the secret to his ability lay in his stomach lining, which was so thick that he was able to digest metal—nine tons of it, in fact, before he died of natural causes.Enhanced MemoryReported to be more of a curse than a superpower.The most well-known example is that of Marilu Henner, who can remember nearly all the events in her life, down to the minutest details.She has a neurological condition called hyperthymesia (AKA highly superior autobiographical memory (HSAM)), which allows her to store memories like pictures on a camera roll—when she visits these memories, she claims it is like rewatching old videos or looking at old pictures. She can even pinpoint which memories occur at what point in her life and recall specific memories from that time.Enhanced Intelligence and Rapid CalculationScott Flansburg, AKA The Human Calculator, is capable of performing mental mathematical functions faster than a calculator.There have been many, many instances of insanely fast calculation performed by this man, but what makes him so unique is how his power came about.A rare, unnamed genetic mutation had combined the area of the brain that does math with the area of the brain that controls movement—the motor cortex. Thus, his brain was hardwired to do math as easily as walking and talking.Enhanced Sense of SmellJoy Milne from Scotland has an extremely unusual ability: she is capable of smelling Parkinson’s Disease and some forms of cancer before diagnosis. In a study conducted by Edinburgh University, she could smell the disease 12/12 times on average. Joy could even detect the disease just by smelling a patient’s clothes.This was a major breakthrough, since it led scientists to conclude that the disease gave off a molecular signature in the form of an odor—one that could be tracked.Before long, a collection of 10 molecules were found, all were unique to Parkinson’s patients. The cause for this ability is still unknown.Weather and Cold ResistanceWim Hof, a Dutch athlete known locally as the Iceman, is capable of surviving in extremely cold temperatures, due to his strange breathing patterns.Hof can consciously control his breathing to speed up his heart rate, raise his adrenaline levels, and increase his nervous system activity. He claims that he has achieved this level of self-control through meditation and the “Wim Hof Method,” which he says that anyone can use to gain a greater degree of self-knowledge.As a result, he’s capable of withstanding extreme cold, and has performed many mind bending feats, like staying in an ice-bath for almost two hours and climbing Mount Everest in his underwear.Superhuman EnduranceIt may sound over dramatized, but this one truly is superhuman.Dean Karnazes, an ultramarathon runner, was born with a quite peculiar trait: his body does not produce lactic acid.Lactic acid causes the burning sensation you feel when you exercise. When it builds up, your muscles undergo fatigue. Karnazes’s body, on the other hand, does not experience this buildup. Thus, he can run inconceivable distances, usually without breaking much of a sweat.Karnazes has achieved numerous mind-boggling feats using his gift, such as:These are but a few of his accomplishments. It has been speculated that, should he be supplied with adequate food and water, he could run indefinitely and only be stopped by injury to his feet.Superhuman Bone DensityA man back in 1994, only known as John, was involved in a car crash, and walked away completely unscathed. A subsequent X-ray revealed that his bones were about eight times denser than the average person’s, meaning that John (and his distant relatives, sprinkled across the Eastern Seaboard) was capable of surviving almost all forms of blunt-force trauma, and his bones would not fracture.A mutated region of chromosome 11 turned out to be the cause. John and his relatives all had a mutation called LRP5, which deals with the LDL receptors in the body, and a total of 21 other family members had the condition.Thank you for reading.Sources:The world's densest bonesMeet the woman who can smell Parkinson's diseaseWeird world records: bizarre entries in the Guinness Book of World RecordsThe women with superhuman visionScott Flansburg - Human Calculator - Super Human Number 8 - Real life SuperhumansSuperior Autobiographical Memory & Hyperthymesia RecallScience Explains How the Iceman Resists Extreme ColdDean Karnazes","129,091 followers",Jessica Su,5.3K,1.5K,49.6M,https://www.quora.com/Why-does-the-Western-world-treat-China-unfriendly

They're excelling in their financial reforms, India's current government is focusing more on exporting rather than importing which will eventually establish India as a manufacturing hub.As per InternatIt would beMany might say “but what about China?” Well, I consider China somewhat of a superpower already.But let's try to know why India could be the answer to this question.Economic Strength and Rise —India is currently the 3rd largest economy by GDP Purchasing Power and the 5th largest economy at current exchange rates ($3.5 trillion).India is growing at a very fast pace. They're excelling in their financial reforms, India's current government is focusing more on exporting rather than importing which will eventually establish India as a manufacturing hub.As per International monetory fund, below are the average growth rate the major countries will be having in 2022 —India — 8.2%China — 4.4%USA — 3.7%Russia — - 8.5%India's Economic Diversity —India's diversification of it's economy is also a big reason for India's huge rise. As our world is moving towards the new age, the world is relying on softwares and IT now. India's huge software and IT industry is almost invincible in that regard.So much that even the Mega Super Developed USA is dependent on India for IT services today.India's stock market is also changing rapidly. Just last year, Indian stock market surpassed French stock market to become the 5th most valued stock market upon beating UK, Canada and Saudi Arabia.Latest Edit —IndiaIndia's Foreign Relations —We have also observed India's sudden change in reaction towards global matters.From my understanding of geopolitical changes, India has adopted an aggressive stance over a defensive one for now.In the past 3 years, India has made it's presence known all over the world. From doing humanitarian activities across the globe to influencing their neighbours who were once their enemies.The Colossal Connection (India-US bond) —India-US relations have also changed drastically where USA who now sees India as a major strategical partner and is supporting India's rise in Asia for the moment, once was anti-India.According to USA's Indo-Pacific strategy, it considersOver the past decade, the closeness between India and USA has grown a lot. They've signed multiple Military and Information sharing pacts with each other as well and I'm sure many more are coming in near future.According to America's own diplomats “USA needs India more than India needs USA ”.But USA has it's own motives. China will surpass USA in almost everything by the end of this decade which will eventually end the Western Hegemony.India is the only country which can counter China in the current scenario. A strong and powerful India is in USA's best interests for now and America will do everything possible to keep things that way.So the West will keep supporting India as long as they see a threat in China and Russia.India's Masterpiece of a Foreign Policy —India is among the few countries in the world which can play both Russia and USA at the same time.India is nearly immune to Western sanctions and also gets to trade with sanctioned countries like Russia and Iran and I can't think of any other country which can do the same.I can write a lot more but I believe these are enough points.","3,755 followers",Venkateshwar Jayakanth,9.7K,0,0,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-closest-thing-you-have-to-a-superpower
