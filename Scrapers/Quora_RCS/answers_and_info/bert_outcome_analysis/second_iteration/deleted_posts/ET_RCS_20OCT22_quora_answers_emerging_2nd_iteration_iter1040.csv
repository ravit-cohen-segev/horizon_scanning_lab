To use Sanderson’s example from a class lecture, the magic ring Bilbo finds and keeps is a rather technical use of magic. We know exactly what turns it on, what turns it off, and what it does in the context of the book, The Hobbit. This makes it very useful, understandable, and relatable for the audience. It also limits what you can do with it. The character is responsible for figuring out how to use it to get out of a situation.At the other end of the spectrum is “Wonder!” The wow factor. The sense of awe we feel when something truly amazing happens. Using The Hobbit as example again, this is best applied to Gandalf. We never really see his magic from a technical point of view. He's just suddenly there, with light blazing from his sword! Even getting the trolls arguing among themselves until the sun rises is portrayed as amazing. And, in The Fellowship of the Ring, he faces down the Balrog. We have no idea how he does it, but it is an awesome scene.Science has a similar spectrum.On one end, is the everyday, routine technology that practically everyone is familiar with. This category includes internal combustion powered vehicles, jet planes, telephones, T.V.s, video games, etc. Unless you are a member of some lost tribe in deepest, darkest Borneo, you've seen these things and they're not that big a deal.On the other end, the end of wonder, are things that we hear about, but are unlikely to ever experience. These include gong into space, super computers, subatomic structures, quantum theory, black holes, worm holes, pulsars, exo-planets, interactive volumetric displays (what many people call holograms, but are not), laser guns, space stations, giant battle robots, sending probes to places outside the solar system, etc. These are all things that we can know about or do with current levels of technology, but seem magical due to rarity. These are the scientific seeds that feed the imagination of science fiction.Just imagine what some lucky person or persons might be able to do next year…..When radio phones were rare, they were exciting. Now practically everyone owns or has seen cell phones. Once, the dense clouds of Venus inspired stories of swamps and mists, the changing colors of Mars inspired visions of canals and great civilizations. Now we know better and such stories have faded.",0 followers,Jim Hogarth,10.4K,94,5.5M,https://www.quora.com/What-aspect-of-science-makes-it-an-inspiration-for-science-fiction

About how we can manipulate time and how time travel may or may not affect events. It was all about fun and adventure, but science fiction seems to have drifted away from that. A lot of science section I see out there is military science fiction where we are out there just blowing things up, or worse or nothing more than mercenaries hired by others to do the blowing up that they want.Reading the science fiction of the 40s 50s and 60s encouraged my desire to study astronomy and physics, but today I have a little desire to read most of the crap that's coming out. Most of it seems to be either militaristic or dystopian. I have read very few books by modern authors that talk about space travel for the pure sake of adventure.But to get back around to the original question, science inspires people to study the universe and science fiction gives them the imagination of what that study could bring.",0 followers,Tamara M,2.1K,101,14.1M,https://www.quora.com/What-aspect-of-science-makes-it-an-inspiration-for-science-fiction

3,"A new, surprising answer suggests that the formation of the Moon happened rather quickly, literally within hours.The most widely accept theory is that he Earth's moon was created when the young planet was hit by a Mars-sized protoplanet (Theia) ca 4.5 billion years ago.

Then the debris of the protoplanet and the ejected earth material first formed a debris ring around Earth, followed by a gradually concentration of its components by the greatest piece - via gravitational attraction to form the Moon. What has puzzled researchers are lunar peculiarities like the almost identical isotopic composition of Earth and Moon. Then too, what happened to the rest of the protoplanet Theia in terms of what portion is present in the Earth and the Moon.Jacob Kegerreisand his colleagues from NASA's Ames Research Center have analyzed the collision of Theia and Earth using more extensive computer simulations. Most previous lunar simulations comprised analyses of 100,000 to one million particles, resolutions that can’t conclusively determine some core features of the impact like the planetary rotation period or the mass of ejected debris. To improve on this, they used 100 million particles of 14 kilometers each and ten trillion tons of mass as a basis. Simulating about 400 collisions, they varied the angle of impact, the masses, temperatures and rotation of the celestial bodies involved as well as the impact speed, calculating which paths, shape and mass the ejected collision debris followed.The analysis showed that If the protoplanet hit Earth at about a 45-degree angle (the usual assumption) this would throw large, only half-melted chunks into near-earth space, as their simulations showed. But, surprisingly, a second chunk would have detached from the first larger object and catapulted into a farther outer orbit like a slingshot:Credit: NASAThe simulations pointed to a timeframe of about five hours after the collision when the larges outer chunk stabilized in an almost circular orbit around Earth, containing almost 70 percent of today's lunar mass. The outer shell would have attracted the chunks of Earth debris and that wout explain why the Moon’s outer rock shell consists of around 60 percent earth rock, hence the measured isotope matches to the Earth.The authors have posted a video of their simulation on youtube:AbstractThe Moon is traditionally thought to have coalesced from the debris ejected by a giant impact onto the early Earth. However, such models struggle to explain the similar isotopic compositions of Earth and lunar rocks at the same time as the system's angular momentum, and the details of potential impact scenarios are hotly debated. Above a high resolution threshold for simulations, we find that giant impacts can immediately place a satellite with similar mass and iron content to the Moon into orbit far outside Earth's Roche limit. Even satellites that initially pass within the Roche limit can reliably and predictably survive, by being partially stripped and then torqued onto wider, stable orbits. Furthermore, the outer layers of these directly formed satellites are molten over cooler interiors and are composed of around 60% proto-Earth material. This could alleviate the tension between the Moon's Earth-like isotopic composition and the different signature expected for the impactor. Immediate formation opens up new options for the Moon's early orbit and evolution, including the possibility of a highly tilted orbit to explain the lunar inclination, and offers a simpler, single-stage scenario for the origin of the Moon.",0 followers,Wayne Boyd,968,5.1K,13.6M,https://www.quora.com/What-aspect-of-science-makes-it-an-inspiration-for-science-fiction

Scientists made few theories to explain the origin of moon. Let's discuss them.One of these rocks having a size of Mars and collided with proto earth. Scientists called that Mars sized object as Theia. Huge energy released and the matter plugged out in space. That matter when reached to the orbit of (where is today) moon, it started to orbiting earth.These small pieces of rock formed a ring in orbit of today's moon. Due to huge energy (that energy was so large that all Nuclear weapons on earth can't produce it), that matter formed a singed ring. Within an year, that melted remnant gathered to form our Moon. The chemical composition of moon is same as of Earth because both had same origin. That idea was strange yet it gave many answers regarding the formation of Moon. But soon, that theory was also caught in questions. If Theia collided with earth, then the composition of Moon should be the mixture of both (earth and Theia). Because it's impossible that Theia remained safe even after colliding proto earth, some of its matter must also plugged out which later formed moon. But scientists found the chemical composition of moon exactly same as earth.Later, centre part of rotating Synestia was cooled of to form earth and rest remnant formed moon. It means the chemical composition of earth and moon is same because both of them were formed with mixture of proto earth and Theia.As soon as the amount of collisions increased, more matter joined the orbit of today's moon and these moonlets formed Moon after some time.Indeed, it's our moon which made our home planet habitable.",UNKNOWN,Robert Frost,1.6K,9.4K,195.4M,https://www.quora.com/What-aspect-of-science-makes-it-an-inspiration-for-science-fiction

China thinks, China imagines if he was to play it, how would he deal with all these challenges.One day when China has barely that kind money to buy the computer to play the game, China amazes everyone — fewer mistakes, dodges monsters, mad skills. So good that someone even claims that China cheats.Sooner or later China is going to reach the level, like anyone else, where no one has ever been before.There will be no one there to show China how this game is played.How will China deal with it then? No one knows. No one can know.But, what we know for sure is, whatever China does next, is anything but boring.What happens in the next few decades is going to be interesting either way. Whether China fails, because the transformation to a great world power based on new technology didn’t quite clutch with the failing old industrial paradigm; or China succeed in transforming by something industrial-revolution-worthy new technology, something hard for others to imitate, and complete refresh the way people think, live, fight wars, trade, produce.Now, I notices folk in this question mentioned Japan’s anticipation to overtake the USA in the 1980s, and of course that attempt was shattered by the 1989 Plaza Accord. (Although everyone kind of knows it’s massing a huge bubble, the Plaza Accord just kind of popped the bubble prematurely)I just want to add here how Japan’s success story inspired China in the 1980s and 1990s.We are kind of Communist Country (we are not, but…) and we study the Communism Doctrine. And that means we analyze things through the lens of Marxism’s basic pattern of human society evolution. Long story short, before Japan made its success, we were… kind of pessimistic.Why? Because Marx said that to develop a Capitalism, a country must have a primitive accumulation of wealth. The west did it by pillaging and taking over resources from the colonies. Obviously we couldn’t do that any more, the moment had passed. That is why in Mao’s era we were “skipping Capitalism and straight into Communism”. Not because Capitalism was evil or anything (mostly), but because we thought it was not possible to develop capitalism the way the west had (1. we were a victim of such brutal process, we would not do it to some other countries again; 2. even if we get past this moral constraint, the free world would be all over our asses for doing it, because they are hypocrites. They might even resort to military confrontations)Yes, that was kind of a failure, and it was met with a less than delightful ending — the infamous Cultural Revolution.After it had died down together with the dearest supreme leader Mao Zedong. We were confused — where to go?Then Japan came along.What is Japan’s story exactly?After the WWII, Japan was a war marred country in smoking ruins. Americans occupied it, all its glory and dignity gone. No resources, typhoon and earthquake ridden lands…Somehow, it managed to survive. And not just survive, it thrived!Ha, how about that Karl Marx and Adam Smith!Japan grew, and grew. It defied everything taught in the Marxist doctrine.It took the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party some time to study before they get to the slogan that brought us this far today.“Technology is the first tier drive for productivity.” — 1988.You think all Deng Xiaoping did was having some table tennis with Nixon, opened up some ports in Southern China? The leadership back then did a whole lot of things that are not well known in the west.Screw ideology! Screw system! Screw “everyone should be equal”!Really? It surprises you? China suddenly has all that new gizmo and gadgets? Do you think all of that happens overnight?We worked hard for 40 years for today.40 fucking years.And you just noticed it now?It will be interesting to see where China is headed.I witnessed all of that by myself, and I shall continue to witness a little more.",7 followers,Mo Chen,601,502,6M,https://www.quora.com/What-aspect-of-science-makes-it-an-inspiration-for-science-fiction

The great cultural destruction during Mao’s era is a proof of the extremes to which Chinese would go!It is a very good thing - China had a clean slate - a fresh slate - a slate cleansed with blood of many people who died during the struggle. China got rid of all the superstitions along with their old culture.

They have a copy of facebook - they have a copy of uber - they have a copy of twitter - they have a copy of a copy of a copy i.e. there are other companies trying to make copies of the chinese copies.The entire chinese state understood - the necessity of development - and they are pushing for it at any cost. Most of the chinese cities are covered with smog - but chinese can’t afford to stop their development - They need to make goods - services and sell them to make profits - as long as they make profits they develop.The Chinese are done with roads within their countryThe Chinese are done with RailsThe Chinese are done with PORTS - All these are ports developed by ChinaThe Growth Engine of China owes a lot of its Exports and Export trade is done by ships - not by road or by rail. Globalization happened over Container Terminals, Ports and Oceans - Unfortunately most of Indian - Ports are unfit for Docking International Ships - Hilarious but True - Indians never invested in making their ports world class - Chinese are done with ports not only in their country but also internationally -The Chinese are NOT Done with AIRPORTS YETThe only comparable infrastructure of India with China is in terms of AIRPORTS - India can compete with China on air traffic.But this too will pass - With China building hundreds of airports - by 2020 they will induct more than 100 new airports - to tackle the extreme congestion and delays in air port travel across the nation.I WILL SUM IT UPIndia pales in comparison to China in International PatentsNOTHING CAN BE DONE WITHOUT INVESTMENT IN INFRASTRUCTURE - i.e. utilization of WEALTH to create more WEALTH - which starts a virtuous cycleEquivalent to investing the first twenty years of your life to education - China spent twenty years of its life from 1980 to 2000 in learning about developing profit making machines and investing in them - building cities - tows - roads - railways - and everything and anything in a mad rush to build - sell - repeat;make - sell - repeat; after millions of these selling cycles to international customers - The Country is now reaping the fruits of its investments made decades ago and pursued relentlessly.",810 followers,Boni Aditya,5.4K,408,1M,https://www.quora.com/What-aspect-of-science-makes-it-an-inspiration-for-science-fiction

One other thing to keep in mind is that the PRC isn’t the only country that wants access to Russian military technology, the US & Europe have just as much incentive to steal Russian tech, regardless of whether they want to reverse engineer it. For Russia, leaking tech to the US or EU is no better an outcome than leaking to the PRC. At least with the latter, Russia can make some money in the process.On the other hand, Russia gains multiple benefits to selling advanced arms to the PRC, despite the aforementioned IP theft risks:The bottom line for Russia is that",52 followers,David Levy,2.8K,293,1.9M,https://www.quora.com/What-aspect-of-science-makes-it-an-inspiration-for-science-fiction

However, even Americans will admit that this wealth was obtained by unethical means.The American Industrial Revolution was certainly kickstarted by quite a bit of industrial espionage.It is thus rather ironic that the Americans accuse the Chinese of doing exactly what they had done some 200 years earlier: 1789, 1812, 1816.Bibliography:Samuel Slater - WikipediaFrancis Cabot Lowell - WikipediaLowell mills - WikipediaFull text of ""The descendants of Nathaniel Mowry of Rhode Island""Instead of enjoying the perks of ""leadership"" while ignoring or actively promoting the steady degradation of their countries' social unity and economic bases, smug European and American government leaders should have been curious about China's technocratic leadership and tried to emulate or at least adapt some useful lessons.Explicit details of how to overtake Western economies were discussed in open literature (in Chinese) decades ago. If they had cared about doing their jobs (protecting the prosperity of the citizens that they often hold in disdain), these ""leaders"" would have acted less foolishly.Reverse engineering, which only explains a small part of China’s rise, is beside the point. Without a well-educated, hardworking, cooperative population and farsighted technocratic leadership, modern Chinese success would have been impossible.Image Credits:The comic sequences are derived from a public domain comic whose copyright has expired.

Do we really need to ask why people would want to overthrow a government that does this to its own people? Look at how Tibet was governed under the Dalai Lama. This is what paid for his robes and palaces. This is what fed the monks who ruled Tibet. This is the cost of his government’s rule. Ask yourself, seriously, Is any holy man, no matter how cute, worth an old man in chains? Should we support a man who did this kind of thing to his people? Can we trust a leader who led a slave state, and now wants to return to power under the slogan of “Free Tibet”?We are not shown these images in the West, rather we are sold an image of the monks and the Dalai Lama as a good, and Tibet as a paradise before 1949. These claims made by the Dalai Lama are false, as anyone who looks at the picture above can see.Any country in the world, when it sees such abhorrent crimes against humanity going on next door, would intervene. The only reason why, in this case, we ask about China’s actions is because China has been slandered in the West to such a degree that even a totally justified action like ending a brutal slavery-supported theocracy is questioned.Clearly, their removal of the slavery supported monks was justified, thus we should ask: Why do we trust slave owners more than the Chinese? Why do we blindly accept the lies we are told in the West? Why do we put such emphasis on physical beauty and the appearance of holiness, while ignoring the Dalai Lama’s brutal deeds while he was in power?That photo, and the insane levels of cruelty that were common under the rule of the lamas, makes it clear why China removed them from power. Other reasons definitely played a role, but this reason by itself is more than enough to justify the Chinese intervention to end slavery in Tibet.",49 followers,Awdhesh Singh,2.5K,5.3K,218.8M,https://www.quora.com/How-did-the-Moon-form-1

That is US is not ready to share its technology with India. But previously it agreed for TOT, now they denies it. I am not telling to copy US technology like China, but it has some fine piece of technology I.e., Tejas. It can be more developed with some help from France and Israel, no need for US tech. One must remember, when US asked Russia not to supply Croygenic fuel to India to conduct space flight. What happened. Now India is the top most in space programme superseding NASA. Again when US put a ban on India for purchase of super computer. Indian scientist made super computer at a much lesser cost and then Canada and Australia showed their willingness to purchase super computer from India. So it is not necessary to follow Chinese policy, when there is no lack of talent in India. India will be great in its way.","17,198 followers",Sean Lana,7K,718,36.1M,https://www.quora.com/How-did-the-Moon-form-1
