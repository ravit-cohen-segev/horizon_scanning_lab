It is necessary to adapt to new technology and retain the status quo in today's fast-paced environment.I'll tell you about one institute that offersBut first, a little background on the Data Science field:Data science is currently the most popular job-oriented degree, and it is booming in the IT industry.A data scientist's responsibilities include:Let's get back to where we left off:What is the greatest Data Science Institute in the National Capital Region?To begin, you must pick whether to attend online training sessions or offline instruction at a preferred institute, as the latter holds the majority of the information.Now that you've decided that learning online is a better option, let's talk about job help and course costs:Each student must find work with a respected company after completing the course.Support for mock interviews based on desired job roles is also available:2. The cost-effectiveness structure of the course for professionals learning data science is as follows:Data science is a skill rather than a course of study. As a result, it is not worthwhile to invest more than Rs. 1 lakh. The best data scientist training institution should not cost more than 1 lakhs, especially if the applicant is a working professional, and Learnbay is one of the institutions that does not charge a high fee for its courses.Let's have a look at Learnbay's Data Science course:Data science and artificial intelligence specialisation in one or more areas:Artificial intelligence and data science leadership certifications:Over 15 tasks will be assigned to you, all of them are real-world projects and assignments.Furthermore, if you enrol at Learnbay, you will have the option of taking Domain Specialisation Modules, which will allow you to choose any domain for your profession from the electives listed below:Let me explain a couple of the notions that fall under them:Retail E-Commerce and supply chainSales, Marketing and HRThe Learnbay Institute is the only place where you may find the above-mentioned Domain.So, I hope you've concluded that Learnbay is the finest at offering work assistance and that its course fees are very fair.Learnbay also has the following qualities that set it apart from its competitors:Finally, Learnbay offers a support crew that is available to help you.Best wishes on your journey.

You were so interested in Civil Services for the last 05 years and why are you suddenly shifting to the Corporate sector now ? Are you after money? Don’t you want to do govt service anymore or work for the public, that you have advocated so much for half a decade?I have got a lot of accusations, of being money minded, this and that in the PMs in Quora.This is an answer to everyone, an answer which would describe my thought process in taking this particular decision.Before, starting with that, let us understand the structure of the Government’s Bureaucracy. That will help us have more clarity, in understanding my decision.The Government is divided into Levels, according to the 7th Central Pay Commission. There are totally 18 levels, with 03 entry points.Level 01 - 05 - Lower ServicesLevel 06 - 09 - Middle ServicesLevel 10 - 18 -Now, I have always aspired for the upper civil services, usually conducted by the UPSC, which deals with the upper management of the Government.This is where most of the “thinking” is done, this is where policies are “ideated” and this is where public policies are “drafted”.An IAS joins at Level 09 during training, and then starts off from Level 10, and has the possibility of having more than 07 promotions in his career of 35 years.This is where I wanted to be, join the bureaucracy, and then rise high enough to shape the policy-making. (Usually around Level 13 or so)Now, I have been working with the MHA for the last two years, at Level 07.This is the middle management services.This is where the policies which areWorking in rural Bihar for the last 02 years, I have understood the exact ground realities, of where exactly it is going wrong, and how the policy drafting needs a bit change, by someone who has actual on-ground realistic experiences.But, a Level 07 employee can grow upto max of Level 10 or 11, where you start competing with junior IAS officers when you are about to retire. (Example Promoted SP vs IPS SP)So, in a span of 35 years, I will get only 3–5 promotions, and that too will be still stuck in middle management, and never reach the “ideation” and “policy-drafting” stages.So, how do I make a shift from “Policy Implementation” to “Policy Drafting” now? Which is where I really want to be.I am not able to clear the UPSC exam. I have tried.I am stuck in middle management, away from home, with an unstable life, mediocre salary, erratic transfers and postings, very few promotions and very slow career growth and strained personal relationships.If I get married to anyone soon, she would want to work in a city, which would again increase long distance and put more strain on the family.So, how do I make a shift from “Policy Implementation” to “Policy Drafting” considering all these factors?The answer came here -And this privatization of the Government by bringing in external specialists is going to increase a lot in the next two decades or so.And they are getting Joint Secretary posts directly, which is a Level 15 post. A direct jump from Level 07 to Level 15, and if I stay I would retire by Level 10.I had to think.I had a plan.A long-term plan, with lots of risks and possibilities of failing.Get into the corporate sector.The lateral entry needs 15 years of total work-ex. I already have 05 years work-ex (Startup, Sabre and MHA)I need to work for 10 years, a decade in the corporate sector, after which I can make a shift to upper civil services - Level 15 in a very short time.And I have seen the 6000 applicants - Some are good, some are okay, not that stellar - I know my work ex in the Central Government in rural Bihar would stand out and would get a chance to interview for the Joint Secretary posts - This is 10 years later I am talking about - 2030 - When I am around 38 years old.So, how do I jump into the corporate sector?Some private job which deals with Public Policy or Development Consultancy or Social Impact or Public Administration jobs ?Also, I need a post-graduation, ensuring all the educational qualifications are in place.So, I made a list of colleges/schools/institutes which would get me a Post Grad and a job in the public policy sector domain.And I wanted to apply for Indian schools only - Not, US, UK, Asian, etc. No INSEAD, NUS, LBS, nah - They don’t align with my goals.I could have tried CAT for the IIMs PGDM, but I am too old for that, with 5 years of work ex, I wouldn’t get much of public policy related jobs.I could have tried for IIMs Executive MBA, the PGPX and EPGP, again they don’t specialize in Public Policy analysis that well.ISB made the perfect sense to me.ISB has a specialization/major in Public Policy - Govt of Andhra, Telangana, Dalberg, Cargill - All working in PP sector come for placements. I could try for management consulting for govt sector or development consulting roles - Which are around 200 jobs in total.Work for 10 years in the Corporate sector with Public Policy.Higher pay, urban life, faster promotions, happy family life - And most importantly, I can focus on public policy ideation.And a decade later, apply for the lateral entry to the Government as Joint Secretary posts.And then see what will happen.I know it is a long shot. But a plan had to be formed.And that is why the MBA. At this juncture.I am 27 years old. Time is running out.A One-Year flagship ISB MBA made sense to me, which will plunge me to the upper public policy analysis sector of the corporate world.And that is why theIt is not the money or the getting suited up or anything.I had the goal of Govt Policy ideation and drafting 05 years ago. UPSC was the best way to do it. It didn’t happen.So, now will try the second best way to reach the goals.The ends are the same. Only the means have changed.ISB - IITM - MHA - GoI - Quora - Rural Bihar.All are dots that are now being connected.As I said, my story hasn’t ended yet.It has only begun.","62,822 followers",Akand Sitra,2.9K,371,13.2M,https://www.quora.com/Which-is-the-best-data-science-training-institute-in-NCR

6,"Ah, how well I remember all the times that I got a phone call from the duty officer in the middle of the night, got up, got dressed, got in the duty car, rode to a police station or prosecutor’s office, was greeted (often with a note of relief) by the cops on duty, walked into the boss’s office, greeted the man in charge and saw some poor sap American guy (always male) handcuffed to a chair, often so terrified that he was trying very hard not to cry. He looked up and said, “Are you from the embassy? Are you here to get me out?” And I had to answer, “Well, yes and no.”No one from a US (or otherAh, how well I remember all the times that I got a phone call from the duty officer in the middle of the night, got up, got dressed, got in the duty car, rode to a police station or prosecutor’s office, was greeted (often with a note of relief) by the cops on duty, walked into the boss’s office, greeted the man in charge and saw some poor sap American guy (always male) handcuffed to a chair, often so terrified that he was trying very hard not to cry. He looked up and said, “Are you from the embassy? Are you here to get me out?” And I had to answer, “Well, yes and no.”No one from a US (or other) embassy, which means no consular officer, can subvert local laws, get you out of jail, or save you from what’s going to happen to you. What I can and will do is find out who you are and what you were arrested for, and get you un-cuffed long enough to sign a privacy act waiver so that I can do anything else you might want me to do, that I CAN do.For example, I get from you a list of who you want me to call back home, if anyone; give you a list of local attorneys who speak English, are accustomed to handling the kind of crimes you are accused of, and are willing to work for Americans; get the cop/prosecutor in charge to promise he’ll let you call those attorneys; explain (translate if necessary) briefly how your case will be handled by the cops; ask if you’re sick, injured, or hungry, and make sure that you will get medical attention and/or the local equivalent of a cheeseburger.Once that initial visit is over, I go to the embassy and call your mother (and/or whomever else you wanted called), telling her only what you said I can tell her.Then I go home, go back to bed, get up a couple hours later and put in a full day’s work. Part of that will be to write a cable to the Bureau of Consular Affairs reporting your arrest, my visit in detail, and all the contact names and numbers, indicating which I already called and which they should call.Then I monitor your progress through the court system, visiting you from time to time to make sure you’re as okay as can be expected; also cross-check with your attorney, and report every visit and every contact in detail.Once the trial is completed and if you are then incarcerated, I visit you no fewer than four times a year, calling your mom and whomever else you want after each visit, and passing innocuous messages for you.The most important part of my work for you is to make sure that you are treated no worse than anyone else who is arrested, tried, and imprisoned in that country. That means, of course, that if the diet for the prison population is fish soup and rice three times a day, that’s what you’ll eat. If they don’t turn the heat on until the first of December, you’ll get cold. I make sure, as much as possible, that you are not mistreated or picked on for being a foreigner. If you are mistreated or picked on for that reason, I will complain to prison management in such a way that it probably won’t happen again. If you need money to pay for amenities, I will set up an OCS trust account that your mother can send money to, that can then be given to you. With receipts.Also while you are incarcerated, I will take phone calls from your mother, father, ex-wife, former girlfriend, and miscellaneous US buddies and, depending on the privacy act waiver that you signed, either tell them what I can or refuse to even admit that I know who you are.And when you are released at last, I might pick you up at the prison gate, buy you lunch out of my own pocket, renew your US passport while you wait, take you to the airport with the ticket your mother supplied (or that I purchased with money you have already agreed to pay back), make darned sure that you get on the plane, wave you a genuinely fond goodbye, then go back to the office and call your mother one last time to assure her that you’re on your way home. Then write a final cable to CA, slip your file into the cabinet, and turn to the rest of the cases.If all of that is ‘hardly helping,’ so be it.Arrest or Detention of a U.S. Citizen Abroad",78 followers,Rajan Singh,17.1K,360,25.2M,https://www.quora.com/Which-is-the-best-data-science-training-institute-in-NCR

Why do you do that? In real life, how often do you have to do a bicep curl like movement to lift something?The reason we do these exercises is to build our strength and stamina so that we can respond to any situation where we need physical strength. Even more importantly, it improves our overall health parameters and quality of life.Similarly, the reason we study maths or any other subject is that they help build our mental muscle, develop logical thinking, and help us make sense of the world by recognizing patterns.By studying, we are able to build mental models about the world, so that we can respond to situations more smartly than a monkey or an ape would do (That, in a nutshell, is my answer to this question.I also hope that we encourage our children to ask more of these questions and engage them in a meaningful discussion so that we produce thinking citizens, and not compliant robots.","21,922 followers",Vidhi Khandel,19.9K,182,11M,https://www.quora.com/Which-is-the-best-data-science-training-institute-in-NCR

The data is now a little outdated, but I was trying to answer this question. It might look different for university level language classes, but the most popular languages are similar.The languages with increasing popularity these days are Chinese, Japanese and Arabic, which are more frequently (but still rarely) taught in some high schools.The methodology for my survey was to take a sample of up to 10 (or as many as I could find)Note that my results are not strictly ‘foreign languages’ but any non-English language, including American Sign Language, and also Native American languages, and of course Spanish and other languages that are not strictly “foreign” to the country with many immigrants (and always-having-spoken-Spanish communities in the southwest, or French in some parts of Louisiana, etc.). Also, most schools have some kind of ESL (English as a Second Language) program (or at least procedures or assistance); such programs were not included in this study.The most common language by far wasFrench (#2)German (#3)Maybe surprisingly,Ancient Greek (#10)Chinese (#5) and Japanese (#6)And the map for Japanese:Arabic (#11)A number of other European languages were taught rarely or suggested in some states. The most common among these wasRussian (#8)American Sign Language (#9)As a group,A number of other additional languages were suggested, varying by state, but none of these were found to be taught in any of the schools in the sample. Florida, especially, had a diverse array of languages suggested for instruction (see the maps above too, and also for Georgia):Key to map labels:Finally, we can look at a composite image representingOverall, we see that despite individual languages being well represented in certain states, few states actually represented a very high number of languages. And a few of these might be slightly skewed samples: for example, one high school in Lincoln, Nebraska seemed to be skewing the results there a bit (such that Spanish, German, French, Japanese, Chinese, Arabic and Latin are represented for the state). Other states had many suggested languages that were not found in the sample but may be taught elsewhere. Only a few states had any guidelines for language instruction below the high school level (for example, California suggested Spanish, French, German, Japanese or Latin for kindergarten through 8th grade, and actually appeared toOverall, the results showed that for the vast majority of students in the country, they were only offered Spanish and possibly one other language. However, considered together, there was a fair amount of diversity either represented by actual classes or at least suggested at the state level. It also seemed to match demographics and interests/traditions of each state/region to some degree.It should also be noted that some public universities in some states (and often private universities) sometimes (but not always) require language classes (usually two years) for acceptance. But that is never, as far as I know, restricted by language, so the majority of those students have studied Spanish (or French). My guess is also that most of the students studying the other languages (unless they have a personal/cultural connection to the language) have probably already also studied Spanish (or French) as is also common at the university level. Additionally, although many college-bound students must prepare by studying a language, I do not believe that many high schools specifically require language study for graduation (perhaps as an option, with alternatives like art or other subjects). So there are many Americans who have never studied a language, even if they have graduated from high school. And even for those who have, two years of high school language is about the same as one year of university-level classes, enough to, if the student was relatively successful, possibly hold a basic conversation, so only the motivated students who go beyond this basic level achieve conversational ability or even fluency.The conclusion to my term paper:Overall, though our universities have many languages to offer, our high schools do not, and this is causing both systems to be ineffective, producing fewer fluent speakers of world languages, even though universities frequently now require language experience for admission. Language education may even be in decline, as shown by the uncertain future of the AP test for Italian.",203 followers,Saumya Singh,12.9K,0,0,https://www.quora.com/Which-exam-helps-us-to-study-in-foreign-countries

You will see these types of answers; summary:Let's talk about both of them-People in India think MBBS degree from abroad has no value in India because foreign Medical graduates students have to give the FMGE exam to practice medicine in IndiaWell, Indian students also have to give the licensing exam of any abroad country such as USMLE for USA. Does this mean that MBBS degree from India has no value abroad?Ofcourse not. SimilarlySimilarly, foreign medical students have to give a licensing exam to work in India.Update: Both Indian Medical students and foreign Medical graduates has to give the NEXT ( National Exit Test) which will serve as a licensing exam as well as PG entrance exam. NEXT-1 will be conducted in 2022 for the first time.Another reason why most of the people in India think less of MBBS abroad is because of the low FMGE passing percentage.People think that the FMGE passing percentage is low because of the low quality of education in Medical Universities abroad.Well, Nothing can be further from the truth.There are a lot of medical Universities that have high world ranking than most of the medical colleges in India. The Standard of education, Infrastructure, and Facilities are very good in those universities. But here’s the thing, no matter how good the education is or how much better facilities are provided, if a student doesn’t focus on the studies themselves or don’t take advantage of the facilities provided, it’s obvious that he/she will not qualify the licensing exam.Also Before 2018,However, from 2018, qualifying NEET was made mandatory to take admission abroad. I believe that this is one of the best steps taken by the Medical Council of India.Because of this, majority of students already get filtered out and only those students are able to take admission who atleast qualified the NEET and have basic understanding of what was taught in the 11th, 12th Standard.I am sure its effect will be seen from 2024.There is a very common misconception in India that there is no or little clinical experience in abroad. I simply don't understand the logic behind that.Aren't there patients in hospitals abroad? Yes, I agree that there are some diseases that are much common in India and not in other cold countries, but we get experience for those during our holidays in India or during 1-year Internship after MBBS abroad.Students are required to do a 1-month Observership in India during holidays from 2nd year and show the proof of it to the university.Also, medical universities abroad have their own hospitals or university clinics of different departments, many have affiliations with other hospitals in the city. For example, here are some of the major hospital of in Russia-Altai State Medical University Major HospitalNot just this university, there are many universities abroad that have modern hospitals for better facilities and clinical exposure.Northern State Medical University Major Hospital-I.M. Sechenov First Moscow State Medical University Major Hospital-This is just one of the few.Classes (clinical rotations) in hospitals starts from 4th year to 6th year)ThereThe main reason why many foreign Medical students don't have good clinical experience is that they don't learn the local language properly.I can't stress on this enough that one should learn the local language even if the medium of teaching is English as the local language is required to interact with the patient, take patient history, etc.So what exactly is the problem?When we talk about MBBS abroad, we talk about so many countries such as-We can't generalize the quality of education in all these countries.Each of these countries mentioned above has its own set of pros and cons, however, no Consultants talk about them clearly, their main focus is just on sending students to particular universities without any information about the medical education there.There are many good universities for doing MBBS abroad but there are some universities which have some problem.Problem in the sense- no proper infrastructure, assistant teachers, Bilingual Universities and the biggest problem- high influence of a Consultant on the university.Let me tell you one thing straight, there is no country where all colleges are good, not even in India.When you go for MBBS abroad, 2 things can happen:At last, choose a good university, if you need any help in deciding the best university for you based on your requirement such as fees, your future plans, facilities, etc, you can get in touch from the contact details mentioned in my profile.Best of Luck,Sachit Dahiya",380 followers,Abhishek Kasar Patil,1.4K,107,814.3K,https://www.quora.com/Which-exam-helps-us-to-study-in-foreign-countries

As he looked down at his plate, his eyes fell on the single white scar running all the way from his right wrist to the crook of his arm. He turned his hand a little, watching the scar tissue reflect the light of the fire, and thought back to that tumultuous year. Never would he have imagined being here, this peaceful, with these curious children around him…”Shankar bhaiya! You’re doing it again!” the high-pitched voice broke into his reverie.“Doing what again?” he asked, smiling wickedly at his favorite little boy in the group.

This story is special.

Everything you want people to know about your company can be part of the story.Stories can build the narrative of your business and the services you provide.No matter your size, You want to develop a brand story around your company, not just offer well-priced widgets.If you position your story the right way, almost any organization can have a brand story to tell. Describe what made you start your company, and demonstrate how customers feel about using your service with examples.Show Don't TellTo attract people to your product or service, you have to have context.If you arrive at a website with no decent images, attention to design, or a call to action - you're not likely won't stay there very long. There's nothing attractive or engaging to keep you engaged.Take the competitive advantage that your business provides and show it to your customer in a way they can relate to. Remember, storytelling isn't just words on a webpage it encompasses the whole website experience.Don't simply sell your product. Sell the idea of what your service means to your customer and how it will improve their life.Keep It SimpleA short, straightforward message resounds well with most people because they can identify with the message as it relates to them. It makes the story their own.The classic “Just Do It” is often cited as an example. Each person identifies with the ""It"" differently, but it impacts everyone.Try to create a simple message that works across multiple social accounts with specific CTAs (calls to action) and associated hashtags. Build your communication and imagery around the message in a way that’s clear for people so that they can identify with and share.Mean What You Say And Say What You MeanWhatever tact you take, the most important note to keep in mind is that your brand story has to be real.Don't just make it up from thin air and expect people to go for it. Your customers, clients, and prospects won't buy it. These days you really need authenticity.Use what's true about your brand and your business.Maybe that's the most important thing to keep in mind: your brand story has to be honest. You can’t simply invent something from the air. Those you’re trying to sell to, from customers and prospects to investors and clients, will see it's untrue.People aren't buying from anyone, they buy where they feel a connection.Your story has to reflect something that’s intrinsically true about your brand, which in turn has to reflect something that’s intrinsically true about your offering.It's a crowded environment and getting more so. Companies realize that they have to up their digital game to attract more discerning customers.Brand storytelling is part of that endeavor and critical to your success online.",1 follower,David McPhee,653,7.8K,168.2M,https://www.quora.com/What-course-should-I-choose-hotel-management-or-MBA
