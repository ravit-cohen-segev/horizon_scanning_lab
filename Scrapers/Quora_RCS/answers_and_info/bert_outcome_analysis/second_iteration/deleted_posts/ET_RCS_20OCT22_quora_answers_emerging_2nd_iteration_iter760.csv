They both have people working for them and those people often move from one to the other, so the assumption that governments are inefficient is really a doubtful proposition. Very large scale tests of this have been undertaken. For example, when the State railways in the UK were privatised in 1994, well, all the inefficient routes were closed (to make the system more financially efficient) but thousands of people found themselves without a means of transport. So, was the privatization successful and more efficient or not? It depends entirely how you calculate it. And now, after 25 years, there are loud calls in the UK for the government to take it over again. Jobs would be made more stable again. The public perceptions of those who work in it would go back to the positive perceptions that existed before. Services would improve and the experience of travel would improve as well. Better seats and so on.Just compare the comfort of air travel in the USA before regulations were scrapped in 1981 to now. Where airline seats worse then or now? Did you pay extra for luggage then or now? Were more routes direct routes then or now?Another and more subtle example is when Standard Oil was broken up by the US government (Supreme Court) in 1919 the value of the total parts of the 34 companies that resulted rose 300%. So why did Rockefeller, who owned Standard Oil, not do it himself? Why did he oppose the idea? In fact, the government did him a huge service!So we cannot complain when governments work to oversee free market capitalism. It needs oversight, even if we all condemn socialism, that means the workers take over the means of all production, and no-one is really proposing that idea any more, only reasonable supervision of it, thanks to good government!Finally there is research that indicates that in Europe the people, generally, have greater regard for government than in the USA. They see government as the necessary collective workings of the people to benefit the people; whereas in the USA the characteristic is more towards a limited government because it otherwise reduces the freedoms of the individual.!","220,194 followers",Franklin Veaux,3.6K,47.3K,779.8M,https://www.quora.com/Why-cant-the-government-become-more-efficient

On an MS-DOS based system.Do you know who the biggest users of Windows XP is? The United States Department of Defense. They pay Microsoft millions a year to support it.A lot of organizations are going away from paper based systems. Governments don’t because the costs of implementing non-paper systems are prohibitive.Over a decade ago, the government of Ontario tried to save costs by developing “E-Health”, a common database of patient records that could be used by everyone from hospitals to private practitioners. It was a complete and abject failure from the get go. Imagine trying to implement a system that has to work with every conceivable computer system currently in use.Efforts to make shoestring systems “more efficient” just compound the problem. 20 years ago, the City of Toronto was amalgamated. That meant the six municipal fire departments had to be merged. It was anticipated that this merger would save millions of dollars a year. It did not. There was an immediate cost of $50 million because all six municipalities used different communications systems. They only managed to close one fire hall (it was across the street from another fire hall on a municipal border). They found that it was impossible for one chief to properly supervise all the fire stations so instead of firing five of the six existing chiefs, they promoted one to “Super Chief” to oversee the five existing chiefs.Building Permits? They found that they couldn’t fire any building inspectors or permit inspectors because they still needed the same number to do the job. The problem was that none of the existing six building offices had enough space for all the personnel. They closed the two smallest building offices, but Toronto still has four, each covering a different area of the city. There is only one Chief Building Official, but they need deputies in three of the offices.You can always propose “savings” from consolidating operations, but this often overlooks the “costs” of doing so. For example, in Quebec, the provincial and municipal; governments cut back on the number of engineers they hired and put them in charge of coordination and review rather than design. All the design work was outsourced to consultants who quickly started running the campaigns of the politicians and colluding with contractors to make sure that bid prices went up. It cost the province of Quebec hundreds of millions of dollars in padded fees.",1 follower,David Thomas,833,4.8K,27.5M,https://www.quora.com/Why-cant-the-government-become-more-efficient

This gets rid of that blue light and is VERY comfortable for long gaming sessions at night. My only complaint after using it for around 2 years is that if you’re in the middle of a game when sunset occurs, sometimes when the screen is warming up the framerate drops drastically for a few seconds while it is in the process of doing so.2.) Discord. Talk to your friends reliably. (Used to use Skype…bad decision.) It connects to Steam to find friends for you as well.3.) Steam (duh)4.) CCleaner. You can clean up your hard drive or SSD from useless files and clears up a surprising amount of space fairly frequently. You’d be surprised how many ‘duplicate files’ accumulate on your disk after 2 weeks or so.5.) MSI Afterburner, along with RivaTuner Statistics. I know this is two programs, but they go hand in hand. Even if you don’t overclock (like me), MSI Afterburner is still very useful for creating fan curves for your video card and monitoring its temperatures. RivaTuner gives you an OSD (On-screen display) that you can set to display really anything you want about your components, like CPU usage per core, CPU temperature per core, GPU memory usage, Bus usage, etc. Very useful if you’re curious like me as to what is using things up. There is even a phone app for it, so you can change your settings without having to tab out of your games. Never used it myself, but it seems useful.6.) CPUID everything. This includes CPU-Z, GPU-Z, HWMonitor, etc. You can see your hardware, what part of it is being used, your temperatures, and I believe CPU-Z can benchmark your CPU against other CPUs.7.) If you have an NVidia graphics card, GeForce Experience is vital. It lets you know when there is an update to your video drivers, and it can optimize your games for your specific hardware. It also has Shadowplay, which uses a hardware encoder in your GPU to record videos and screenshots with basically no performance hit in game. It can save the last [up to] 20 minutes of gameplay even if you weren’t explicitly recording it, assuming you have it enabled. The quality of video is very good; I used to use Bandicam, and the quality is basically identical, but Bandicam is very resource heavy.8.) Speedfan. You can set a curve for most fans (some fans don’t like being controlled, don’t know why) so you don’t have to listen to your loud fans all the time when you’re watching a video or something. If you have a lot of fans like I do, it really does make a difference. The Hyper 212 Evo is a great cooler, but damn, is it loud at 100% (at least mine is.) I currently have my CPU fan set to only come on to 100% when the CPU reaches 55°C, so when I’m watching videos or just browsing the web, my PC is pretty quiet. Of course, some fans don’t like being controlled, so those will probably still make noise.Since I can’t some up with 2 more things you SHOULD have, I’m going to name off a few things you SHOULD NOT have.9.) Any of those RAM clearing utilities. Unless you have a super-low end computer with, like, 4GB of RAM, these programs are useless, and sometimes can be detrimental to the performance of your computer. Unused RAM is useless RAM. When a program is cleared from RAM, the next time you want to start it up, it will take a while longer, because HDD and even SSD speeds are nothing compared to the speed of RAM.10.) Skype. It sucks. Especially if you forget to disable it on start-up. It takes approximately 43.7 years to start, and you will often have connection problems, and I have constantly experienced crashing and freezing.

Well, ISRO does use supercomputers, but not directly for predicting the outcomes of a launch. And I guess this goes even for other space agencies, not just for ISRO.I will use some terms like “computational cost” which essentially means the amount (or cost) of computational power necessary to run a given computer code. Associated to this “cost”, a computer code can be “expensive” or “cheap”.Part 1:The code which simulates the launch trajectory doesn’t need a supercomputer. Let’s look how this code might work. Not going deep into the technical details, the basic aim of this code is to determine the position of the launch vehicle. If you give this task to a high school science student who knows his calculus and physics, he will basically attempt to determine the acceleration of the vehicle using the Newton’s second law of motion equivalent :∑So, these equations say, given the external forces on a body, the acceleration can be determined. So, the high school student will ask you what forces act on the launch vehicle and how much does it weigh. I am not saying he can solve this problem, but he would definitely know how to start.If you see this equation, the number of unknowns are just 3, i.e. three components of acceleration, one each in the directions x-y-z. Once, you know them you can integrate them to get velocity. Another step of integration gives you the position of the launch vehicle.So, given the data of external forces, it is just a matter of solving 3 independent unknowns (the accelerations) and 6 dependent unknowns (velocities and position). Hence, the code to solve this problem is not computationally intensive.Of course, it is not so easy as I described, since the forces, which are an input to these equations, depend on velocity and position of the launch vehicle, which are yet not known. Anyway, even after doing some tricksSo, the computer code to determine the path of the launch vehicle doesn’t need supercomputers, not directly at least. I am guessing, that all it may need is a good workstation or a small cluster.Let’s talk more about forces on the launch vehicle. There are many forces to be considered: Aerodynamic forces, propulsive forces, gravity, inertial forces (depending on the frame of reference), etc. The aerodynamic forces and propulsive forces are determined using some “Part 2:Let’s move to how this aerodynamic data is predetermined, and that is when supercomputers come into play. To determine the aerodynamic forces, i.e., force necessary to push through the air, one must determine how the air flows around the launch vehicle. This is done for the more or less the same way for many engineering problems, like missiles, high speed cars and trains, water flow around ships and submarines, wind mills, etc. This field is called “To determine the flow of air around the launch vehicle (or any object), one must solve the equations of motion for a gazillion air particles around the object. The same equation as before, but formulated in different way. Of course, engineers know how good are their computers, so they don’t solve them for all the gazillion air particles around, instead, they find a way to settle for a few millions of them, (very very roughly speaking). Also, the forces on these air particles depend on the behaviour of neighboring air particles, and vice-versa, which makes it a bit more, no sorry, a lot more complicated (that’s why it is separate field and there exists a big industry associated with this, producing softwares capable of doing this).Compare solving the equation of motion for just one particle, i.e. the launch vehicleP.S.",9 followers,Ayush Harshit,3.3K,113,746.9K,https://www.quora.com/Why-cant-the-government-become-more-efficient
