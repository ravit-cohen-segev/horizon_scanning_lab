0,"How did Carnegie Mellon manage to rival Stanford and MIT in CS?The phrasing here seems like Stanford and MIT were the front-runners and Carnegie Mellon built a top CS program against all odds or came from behind. That couldn’t be further from the truth.Turing Award winners Allen Newell and Herbert Simon started the CS program at CMU in 1965, the same year as Stanford. CMU has been strong in computer science since computers existed.","112,399 followers",Yishan Wong,946,1.6K,28.7M,https://www.quora.com/How-did-Carnegie-Mellon-manage-to-rival-Stanford-and-MIT-in-CS

Well, per my experience of 16 years as an educator, I see it from the point of view of following parameters:There are some very good business schools which offer such programs like IIMs, IITs, FMS Delhi, SPJMER, Great lakes Chennai, LBSIM, JIMS, UBS Chandigarh, SIBM, SCMHRD, IBS Hyderabad, LPU Punjab etc.I made it a long read to cover every topic of your interest and its implications so that you make an informed choice.I hope this helpsDVD",207 followers,Satyendra Singh,577,181,578K,https://www.quora.com/How-did-Carnegie-Mellon-manage-to-rival-Stanford-and-MIT-in-CS

This Phase 2 (initial move of libertarians to New Hampshire) won’t be complete until Mover #20,000 rolls his U-Haul next door to me. Carol and I were movers #1991 and #1990, and we just moved here two months ago, {See <(And we’d complete a lot faster if you stop peeking over and wondering how we’re doing, andNow … this first migration is accelerating.There were a few “pre-movers” over the couple decades it took to get enough libertarians to commit to moves. And what is interesting is that as they arrived, many of NH born-and-bred residents who happened to be libertarian-leaning or libertarian-curious joined the FSP (They’re called “pre-staters”). Together, the pre-staters and the pre-movers laid out quite the welcome mat for us. These guys were incredibly active, building new communities and starting organizations and setting everything up for us. So, when we arrive, we have a lot of space already prepared for us to move into! :)From my vantage point (after a whole two months), I think of the impact of the Free State Project {See <1) InfrastructureFree State ProjectMonitoring BillsCommunity CentersLibertarian RepresentationThey have established both aAnd of course, FSP movers must identify and coordinate with the many good non-authoritarians with whom they can ally even if they are not part of FSP.New Hampshire has the highest representative-to-constituent ratio, so if you get here, and you are at all interested, FSP political mentors will help you meet your neighbors and get elected into office. And before you can say, “I want to increase human freedom”, you’re on the House Floor casting your vote for freedom.2. New Political FreedomsOf course, New Hampshire starts out pretty libertarian! That’s why weBut guess what thatSo, there are a lot of onerous laws and regulations on the books right now that violate NH residents’ rights to our own bodies, to our own labors, and to our own property.Early movers, once getting established, organized, and elected to the legislature, have been passing laws that increase NH residents’ freedom, mostly by rolling back prior laws that impinged on freedoms.Just a few that have increase freedom:3. Holding Back Encroachment to Freedom.Thus, much of our time is spent beating back their insidious attempts to drag us towards totalitarianism.Now, to be fair, this is not just something to worry about in NH! You have the same slow strangulation in your own states! It’s just that you’re so outnumbered that you’ve thrown up your hands in defeat and just accept your Death by a Thousand Bills. We have enough folks here that we’re able to fight the good fight!For example, of the four bills that I reviewed last week for the NHLAFor example, one bill proposed to increase the paperwork, reporting requirements, regulations, inspection raids, and punitive fines on small businesses that had the temerity to hire your 17 year old and give him some experience in the real world. One part of the bill even required that the business postThis increase in paternalism would have reduced the number of real jobs in the real world for youths who, after a decade locked in a government institutional building sorely need real experience in the real world {See <The one bill that I was happy to grade “Pro-Liberty” proposed to include Lyme Disease, anxiety, and insomnia as allowable conditions for prescribing medical marijuana. {See <Thus, a lot of the political action right now must be beating back the growth of Leviathan. While this list necessarily would contain4) Outside Of Political Control Marketplaces and InteractionsSome of the first movers are agorists, who offer services and make products and then set up “market days” throughout the state where farmers, homeschoolers, arts and crafts makers, recruiters, home bakers and home chefs, etc., can gather and trade without a lot of government red tape. And those are just our community markets; there is a strong underground person-to-person market.FSP is accelerating the use of crypto-currency — increasing not only our use of it, but educating non-libertarian businesses on how to accept crypto-currency for their transactions as well. It’s amazing to see prices posted in BitCoin, and we even have cryptocurrency stores on the main street of NH cities!Add to that, immediate videotaping of all intrusions of policeWhile naturally distributed amongst hundreds of people, examples include:5) Networking LibertariansYou have a selection of often multiple eventsEach of the six NH regions has its own regional social gatherings, open to all FSPers. My local region (the SeaCoast region) has one official, for-sure social gathering every week, in rotating towns about 20 minutes from each other. But there are also crypto drinks and market days and blood drives and toy drives and “help this new mover” and “Joe’s tools burned up so we’re buying him a new set” activities. And we have discussion groups and meetups for jazz and for rock ’n’ roll …. And those are just the events that are “open to all”.The libertarian community centers and libertarian bars allowI am trying out social events in all the regions in order to meet more folks here. (I mean, I’m not getting any younger, and I’ve wasted so much of my life in authoritarian states, that I’m looking for things to do and people to do ’em with!)And because I’m retired, and excited myself about the prospect of spending my remaining years finally building a freedom community, I’m helping to start up a new social group for empty nesters called “And you probably won’t be surprised to learn that I’m hosting my first ethics discussion group next week!The FSP office creates statewide intellectual conferences (e.g.,6) EntrepreneurshipWhile that is not directly “political”, oftentimes new innovations undermine government control. (For example, Uber circumvented government’s cabby licensing scams that restricted people’s abilities to offer rides and to hire cheap rides.) Many of the startups in NH have a portion of their long-term strategy as circumventions of politicians’ control over free people in various industries.Certainly, the agorist and crypto-currency businesses are great examples of Small Is Beautiful entrepreneurship.We’re seeing everything from off-the-grid folks trading their home-made stuff to new high tech businesses.7) Amplifying LibertarianismOur constant meetings invariably have political, intellectual, charitable, and social aspects. Folks are constantly recruiting for this group or for that activity, or asking you what type of school you’d prefer for your children, and everyone is brainstorming and networking new projects, and it’s an exciting time to be in an exciting place.We have several national libertarian organizations that come here regularly, or are even opening up satellite officesAnd the benefit of our work is not just for NH. For example, FSPers have build video and audio studios that have allowed us a very high concentration of libertarian-leaning podcasts and radio and videos.Support for your project, whatever it is, is just a meeting or a phone call away.However you want to contribute to the most important project of mankind — the freeing of human beings {See <Experience Freedom in Your LifetimeSee Related0534: What is the intent of the Free State Project?0941: 17 Years of Freedom in the States0995: I’m Moving To Free State New Hampshire0557: Who is killing the mom and pop stores?1020: What do libertarians think about child labor?0931: Why are libertarians so preoccupied with the legalization of drugs?0181: What is the greatest achievement possible for human kind?→→ Essays on <→ Return to the <<, FSP, Dennis, Becoming, Parties, Secession, DenPref,>","17,728 followers",Rob Weir,582,16K,30.3M,https://www.quora.com/How-did-Carnegie-Mellon-manage-to-rival-Stanford-and-MIT-in-CS
