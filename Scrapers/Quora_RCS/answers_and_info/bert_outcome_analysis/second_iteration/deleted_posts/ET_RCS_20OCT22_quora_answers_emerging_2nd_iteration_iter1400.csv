Knowing how to start a publishing company and the steps involved in taking a book from idea to publication is an important way to communicate ideas with the world, but before you begin thinking about what to publish, you'll need to know how to publish.1.

Knowing how to start a publishing company and the steps involved in taking a book from idea to publication is an important way to communicate ideas with the world, but before you begin thinking about what to publish, you'll need to know how to publish.1. Determine what kind of publisher you will be. Publishing companies and entities tend to fall into one of five categories, and knowing which category your company will fall under can help you plan out your business.• Trade publishers are publishing companies that deal with industry-specific publications. This category includes the major, well-established publishing houses that put out the majority of fiction in the marketplace.• Textbook publishers primarily deal with academic learning materials. Books published by textbook publishing companies will be primarily bought and used by students.• Scholarly/academic publishers tend to include university presses and not-for-profit publishers. Although this category is lumped in with academic publications, scholarly/academic publishers do not typically publish textbooks.• Reference publishers put out books and other learning materials that build on a body of information. The most common example of a reference publication is a dictionary or thesaurus, but can include many other non-traditional forms of information dissemination.• Self-publishers are authors who choose to take the reigns on how their own work is published.2. Choose a market. There are many existing book publishers, small and large, in operation around the world. The key to success as you think about starting your own publishing company is to decide upon a primary genre and corresponding market for your books. Knowing what market, you intend to work in will help you when it comes time to draft a business model.• Try to start out with a narrow focus. It's best to work within one or two primary genres or markets. If you try to start too big, it may be difficult to manage your company, and potential authors may lose interest if it seems as though the company lacks direction.• Consider working in a market you know. If you have any kind of background in a given market, whether it's through formal education, work or intern experience, or even personal interest, you may find your business more successful in than market than if you tried to jump into unfamiliar waters. You will likely be more dedicated to and passionate about your business working in a market you're familiar with, and you will bring some level of knowledge or familiarity to the table.3. Understand your audience. This is where working in a familiar market can be exceptionally helpful, and may take some planning if you're working in an unfamiliar market. Think about trade publications. The publishers of those publications know what the intended audience will want to read and learn about, and the publishers also know where potential readers look for that information. Tapping into that kind of knowledge may drastically improve the chances of success, and could even give you some contacts as you launch your publishing company.• A good question to ask yourself is, as someone who is interested in a given subject, would you want to read this? You can also expand on this question to consider what other things someone with a shared interest would want to read.4. Choose a name for your publishing company. It can be simple and concise or catchy and clever, but it should be a name you will feel comfortable using for the foreseeable future. If you have a marketing and/or legal team, consult with those workers on a list of names you come up with. It should be easily marketable yet unique and memorable.5. Register your name. If you're using a name for your publishing company other than your own name, you'll need to be sure that that name is not already taken. One way to do this is by filing a fictitious business name statement, or a doing business as (DBA) name. The process may vary slightly, depending on where you live, but the process will entail certain key points no matter where you plan on setting up your business.• Conduct an investigative inquiry within your county and state records to determine if the name you've chosen is in use.• Register your publishing company's name with the appropriate regional office. This may be your county clerk or state government office, depending on the location of your business.• Some regional governments may require you to take out a legal notice in an approved newspaper, usually for one month or less, to announce your business's name to the public and ensure that no one comes forward saying that they are already using that name.6. Buy an ISBN number. ISBN stands for International Standard Book Number, usually included with the bar code on virtually every single book sold through a bookstore. ISBNs are important because they help buyers and sellers identify your publishing business as the publisher of a given book. ISBNs used to be assigned as 10-digit numbers, but in 2007 the format of ISBNs was changed to adopt a 13-digit number. After the first three digits, an ISBN is typically broken up into four sets of numbers.• The first single digit identifies the language of a given book. Zero is used for most publications in English.• After the language digit comes a multi-digit set of numbers called the publisher identification number. This group of digits is your publishing company's unique identification number. Note that small publishing companies tend to have long identification numbers, which means that, due to the limitation on how many digits an ISBN may be, smaller publishers will be able to publish fewer titles under a given ISBN than larger publishing houses. Once a small publishing company has published its allotted number of titles under a given ISBN, that company must then purchase additional ISBNs.• Immediately after the publisher's identification number comes the title identification number. This number or group of numbers identifies the book title by its edition or version. Different editions will require different ISBN title identification numbers.• The last digit in an ISBN is called a check number. It is calculated by a precise algorithm and is used to check (hence the name) that the ISBN was coded correctly.7. Draft marketing and business plans for your publishing company. There are a few business-related decisions you should make before you open up your publishing company, such as how many books you will publish each year, how you will budget your company's finances, and how you will advertise and market your publishing company.• Adequate planning in this phase of starting up your company may be crucial in determining whether your venture into publishing is successful.• Be realistic when planning your budget. Try to keep overhead costs to a minimum, and understand what kind of taxes you should expect to be paying, if you are taxed as a small business.Below are the legal steps that are necessary for registering a business in India:1. Checking the Company Name AvailabilityBefore any company registration can take place, you must check whether the proposed name is available. This can be done online, where applicants may check the availability of their desired company names on the MCA 21 website. Once approved, the selected company name appears on the website.2. Acquiring a Director Identification Number (DIN)A Director Identification Number (DIN) is a special identification number that is provided to any existing or potential directors of companies that are incorporated. A provisional DIN can be obtained by filling a DIN-1 application form online.Then, a printed and signed version of the form must be forwarded to the ministry along with identity and address proof for their approval. A permanent DIN is issued after the verification of the documents and the subsequent approval of the request.3. Acquiring a Digital Signature CertificateA digital signature certificate is an issued electronic key that validates and identifies the holder of this certificate. One of the approved agencies registered with the ministry can issue this certificate. An application form, identity proof, and permanent address proof must be submitted by the company directors when applying for a Digital Signature Certificate.4. Obtaining an Incorporation CertificateAn incorporation certificate is provided by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs and is used as proof for the constitution of the company. To apply, the following forms must be digitally filed on the official Ministry of Company Affairs website – e-form 32, e-form 1 and e-form 18.Along with Form 1, the Registrar of Companies must be provided with one copy of each: The Memorandum and Articles of Association (MoA and AoA), the consent of directors, and a stamped copy establishing the power of attorney.The certificate of incorporation will be automatically sent to the e-mail ID as provided in the information submitted with the forms while incorporating the company.5. Creating a Company Seal for official documentationA company seal is required to be placed on papers for sharing certificates and other official documents. The total cost of acquiring an official seal is dependent on the number of words that need to be engraved on it, the number of seals issued, and the time period for the delivery of the seals. It is to be noted here that the requirement to maintain a company seal is not mandatory for private companies.6. Stamping of all Company DocumentsThe application to have the company’s incorporation documents stamped must always have the unsigned copies of the Memorandum and Articles of Association attached alongside the payment receipt for the same. Stamp duty should be paid online for such documents to the Registrar of Companies.Following this application, the Superintendent will return the copies - one of which is stamped, signed and embossed in an official capacity. Finally, the company promoters must sign the MoA and AoA, with all required information being filled in their own handwriting.7. Acquiring a Permanent Account Number (PAN)Filing of Form 49A is required for the application of PAN. Once a unique PAN is acquired, a physical version of the PAN card will be delivered to your registered address by official post. The PAN application may also be done online, but the required documents will still need to be physically sent for final verification.8. Acquiring a Tax Account Number (TAN)As per the Government of India, a Tax Deduction Account Number or Tax Collection Account Number (TAN) is a special number issued by the Income-tax department to all entities who are required to either deduct or collect tax at the source.To obtain this number, the form 49B must be filled out and submitted at a TIN Facilitation Center. Once the application has been verified, it is forwarded to the Income Tax Department and the TAN is issued. The application for a TAN can be done either offline or through the NSDL website.9. Obtaining a certificate from the State/Municipal Inspector under the Shops and Establishment ActA statement that includes the employer/manager’s names, company’s designated name and permanent postal address and business category must be provided to the State Shop and Establishment Inspector along with the payment of applicable fees. This is a vital step in trade license registration as all companies must be registered within one month (30 days) of the opening of their business.10. Applying for GST RegistrationGST registration is mandatory for any entity seeking to undertake the supply of goods and services across states while maintaining an annual aggregate turnover of more than INR 40 lakhs/20 Lakhs. This should be prioritized before any other process for new company registration. For further information on GST Registration and documents required for the application, you may visit the following link.GST registration is mandatory if you are a seller or are planning to be a seller on11. Obtaining a Profession Tax Certificate from the State Profession Tax OfficeEvery employer (who is not a government officer) is liable to taxation and must obtain a certificate of registration from the relevant authority. A company is required to file Form 1 to the State Profession Tax Office to apply for the Profession Tax Certificate, if applicable.12. Completing a National Employees’ Provident Fund RegistrationEvery employer is required to provide their worker information to the local Employee Provident Fund Organization (EPFO). This must be done in the prescribed manner so that an Establishment Code Number (ECN) can be allotted to the company. This process is within the sole purview of the employer, and no separate applications need to be made by the employees. Note that this will only be required if the provisions of the Employees' Provident Fund and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952 are applicable on the company.",0 followers,Val Cooper,583,1.7K,4.8M,https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-start-and-manage-my-own-publishing-company-in-India-to-launch-my-first-book-What-is-the-procedure-from-beginning-to-end

Masters in Business Analytics is a great choice as you kind of hone both your technical and managerial skills.There are many programs in the universities here in the US and a lot of employment opportunities after you graduate. In fact I have personally seen our managers struggle to find people with Data Science skills. And some of the good programs I know are Business Analytics programs in Oklahoma State University, UT Austin, University of Cincinnati, UT Dallas, University of Connecticut etc. I graduated from Oklahoma State and according to me it was a great choice. Also I suggest you not to consider the ranking of the program - choose one which has strong alumni base, offers mentorship programs and which is not too short. Ours is a 21 months program but most people would be working for almost 7 months (3 months in summer as internship and 4 months in Spring on advanced internships) – I personally had an amazing experience interning for Dell in Austin during Summer 2017 and got to learn a lot.MS in Business Analytics at Oklahoma State University offers a unique blend of coursework in Analytics, Machine Learning, Marketing, Statistics, Business, MIS and Industrial Engineering.The best part is it’s a STEM course with special trainings scheduled along with the course work and a lot of hands on projects every semester. Earlier it was called Masters in Business Analytics but now you can look up for Masters in Business Analytics and Data Science.Your coursework will enable you to be trained on multiple platforms like R,Python,SAS etc.This program focuses on holistic development of students with a unique study plan. Being a Toastmasters club member is mandatory and you become a confident speaker going forward!I was offered Graduate Research Assistantship in the second semester based on my performance in 1st semester and my incoming credentials. Apart from the graduate assistantships, there are also a plenty of part time opportunities on campus and it is a big relief for international students like me. 100% of the students received paid internships in Summer 2018 & Summer 2017.90% of 2018 & 2017 graduates received full time offers within 3 months of graduation.

Top it up with refreshing your regression knowledge. And then, go through a simulated/ online predictive modeling engagement that requires you to apply the programing, the modeling/ statistics, and the visual storytelling.

Every company will have different expectations from an analyst. Generally reporting analysts are not expected to start from scratch (like building Tables etc.). The data will already be provided to you. You need to tell a good story and recommendations with that data. You will generally be expected to know a few reporting tools like tableau or QlikView or even Excel. You should be comfortable enough to Quantify a problem, how big is it and is it worth yours and your team's time to analyze it. You will need to study data after various A/B tests and provide your analysis. Many critical decisions will be taken based on your suggestions. You should be comfortable identifying outliers in a data. This is an interesting field. You might meet a lot of folks, get to know businesses, and consult on need basis.A third path is the Data Science Path. To be honest, there will be a little learning curve if you are planning to switch careers and have no experience at all. If I were to give you a 500,000 ft view of what is data science and Machine Learning, I would say, it is identifying some data, inputting the data to an Algorithm, and the algorithm predicting something.

Our team at Grammarly has compiled a handy list of common grammatical errors to help make your writing accurate, clear, and professional.Ambiguous (“Squinting”) modifiersA squinting modifier is a misplaced modifier that, because of its location in a sentence, could modify either the phrase that precedes it or the one that follows it. In the example sentence, is the subject listening to music slowly or slowly getting a headache? To correct a squinting modifier, move its position in the sentence to clarify to the reader which word you intend to modify.Misuse of lie/layIf you plan to place or put an object somewhere, such as a plate on a table, you should use “lay.” If you intend to stretch out on a bed for a nap, you should use “lie.” The verb “lie” is an intransitive verb, which means it does not need an object. The transitive verb “lay” requires an object.It may take some getting used to this “lay” or “lie” business; after all, misuse of these verbs is common. But if you remember to lay down your fork before you’re full, then you won’t have to lie down later from overeating.Comma splicesHe was very hungry, so he ate a whole pizza.To splice means to connect or join. When a writer joins two independent sentences with a comma instead of separating them with a period or coordinating conjunction, that’s a comma splice.The comma has its jobs to do, but connecting two independent sentences isn’t one of them. Besides, the period gets testy when his sister, the comma, steals his thunder. Periods have their jobs, and so do commas, but never the twain shall meet—unless it’s in the form of a semicolon. Semicolons can also take the place of a coordinating conjunction, such as “and,” “but,” or “so,” among others.Run-on sentencesRun-on sentences, also known as fused sentences, occur when two complete sentences are squashed together without using a coordinating conjunction or proper punctuation, such as a period or a semicolon. Run-on sentences can be short or long. A long sentence isn’t necessarily a run-on sentence.To avoid run-on sentences, see if there is more than one idea communicated by two or more independent clauses. In our examples, there are two complete sentences:Example:Example:Both sentences are complete ideas by themselves; therefore, use a semicolon or a period to indicate that they are separate independent clauses.Using “could of” instead of “could have”“Could have” is always correct; “could of” never is. Writers probably make this grammar gaffe because, when we speak, the contraction “could’ve” sounds an awful lot like “could of.”TautologiesTautologies express the same thing twice with different words. In our example, the word “made” implies that Jack used his own two hands to create the pail. The prepositional phrase “with his own hands” creates a redundancy. Once you know what they are, it’s fun to discover tautologies: dilapidated ruins, close proximity, added bonus, large crowd...The list goes on and on!After reading through this list of common grammatical mistakes, you might be wondering how to remember all these rules as you write.
