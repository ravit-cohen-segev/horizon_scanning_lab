But when it comes to individual freedoms, the opposite is true. Most studies show humanity is now less free than several years ago.20 years ago we had decentralized Internet and a relatively unrestricted banking system. Today, Apple and Google censor information and apps on our phones while Visa and Mastercard limit what goods and services we can pay for. Every year we give up more power and control over our lives to a handful of unaccountable corporate executives we didn't elect.Most of us willingly carry tracking devices – our phones – and allow corporations to use our private data to target us with content that keeps us distracted with low-quality entertainment. Unlike 20 years ago, we are now surrounded by surveillance cameras, which in countries like China use AI to make sure nobody can hide.In 2017, China overtook the US as the largest economy in the world by purchasing power, showing the world that individual freedoms are not required for economic development. Looking at China's success, more countries become authoritarian, curbing essential human rights such as freedom of speech, movement and assembly.Who is going to fix it?The most active and creative minds of our generation are too busy playing in the rapidly shrinking sandbox called ""free enterprise"" or producing digital content to keep everyone else glued to their devices for longer. The rest seem to be too distracted with the abundance of cheap digital entertainment to critically assess the trend and take action.Watching this, I wonder what will become the legacy of our generation. Will we go down in history as those who let free societies turn into dystopian nightmares? Or will we be remembered as those who defended the freedoms that previous generations fought so hard to win?",634 followers,Charles Keyz,2.6K,121,282.9K,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-ways-in-which-technology-has-ruined-our-life

3,"The Echo Chamber EffectWe would think that social media would be an effective tool for bridging divides between differing opinions, but this does not necessarily appear to be the case. For example, Facebook’s algorithms tend to push users toward content which lines up with their interests, which is understandable, and their existing viewpoints, which is troublesome.As a result, users of social media must go out of their way to seek out differing views from their own—and most do not.

For example, Facebook’s algorithms tend to push users toward content which lines up with their interests, which is understandable, and their existing viewpoints, which is troublesome.As a result, users of social media must go out of their way to seek out differing views from their own—and most do not. This effect serves to worsen divides by ensuring that groups on different sides of an issue are having completely different conversations.Interactions between the sides usually only comes in the form of conflict. This has become known as a “filter bubble” in which those who get their news mostly from social media are rarely presented with challenging perspectives.The Web Has Diminished Your Attention SpanWhile it may come as no surprise that the fast-paced consumption of digital media has resulted in aThe result: The average attention span had dropped from 12 seconds to 8 seconds—an astonishing erosion of one-third of our attention span in only 15 years. Although the report points out that there has been a corresponding rise in the ability to effectively multitask, it also points out that eight seconds is less than the attention span of the average goldfish.GPS Affects Brain FunctionGPS has become a nearly indispensable aspect of everyday life. Many of us can’t remember how we ever got anywhere without Maps (hint: actual, physical maps), but researchers at McGill University have presented three studies which suggest that overreliance on GPS can actually be detrimental to long-term memory as we age.This is because the hippocampus, the area of the brain which controls memory, is also associated with spatial navigation. Researchers found a higher physical volume of gray matter—and increased activity—in the hippocampus in their subjects who relied mainly on spatial navigation rather than GPS.One neuroscientist involved with the study even suggested that relying on GPS may lead to the earlier onset of dementia and that avoiding its use when possible may help stave off cognitive impairment.Smartphones Change Your Sleep PatternsA 2012Humans are wired to know when to sleep and when to wake by the quality of ambient light. “Red” light, the type seen at dusk, signals the body that it is nighttime while “blue” light is the signal that it’s time to wake up.This “blue” light is obviously seen in the morning—and is also emitted by smartphones and tablets. This suppresses melatonin, a sleep-promoting chemical in the brain. According to a Harvard study, “blue” light also reduces the overall hours of REM sleep, which is crucial to healthy mental function.Texting Hurts Our Ability To CommunicateTexting has become the primary form of daily communication for nearly everybody. Even Americans in older age groups now send more texts per day than they make phone calls.Much has been made of how text and email communications can rob an exchange of context, but the problem runs deeper than this. New research suggests that texting may be slowly depriving us of our ability to read emotional cues in others.Such nonverbal, visual cues are a critical component of conversation, and some developmental psychologists worry that a lack of experience with them can be particularly damaging to the social development of young people.While most adults entered the mobile age with their social skills already formed, this is not the case for children and teenagers. These young people may find themselves more limited in their ability to have a face-to-face conversation than previous generations.Fake News Keeps You MisinformedThe proliferation of “fake news” websites has generated a great deal of real news in 2016. These websites sometimes mimic genuine news outlets, complete with legitimate-looking URLs.Fake news sites have come under fire for publishing misleading articles in the pursuit of clicks. One might think that such easily debunked fake stories could have little impact in the Information Age, but one Stanford study conducted in 2015 dramatically suggests otherwise.Multiple assessments were made of the ability of middle school, high school, and college students to evaluate the trustworthiness of information online. In one, fully 80 percent of participants failed to differentiate between an article and an advertisement labeled “sponsored content” on the same page.In another, only 25 percent of students were able to tell a verified Fox News Twitter account from a fake, with over 30 percent arguing for the legitimacy of the phony account because of graphics elements it contained.Technology is a two-edged sword. It provides benefits beyond belief with the same ease it can destroy dreadfully. The solution is in the to use it correctly. The word 'correctly' however, is highly subjective, and often utterly prone to 'special' interests! These interests range from politics to business. The destruction, if we want to call things by their own name, of the environment is affected by both! Money is behind these technological problems that cause problems.. Consumers are virtually brainwashed to use a torrent of increasingly more complex functions on an ever increasing kinds of devices! With every thing made easier, or completely done for us, through the use of technology, people are slowly but surely forgetting how to to do things the old fashioned way…good old hard work. You no longer have to pull out the dictionary or visit the library if you want information, you can simply type in a question and get an answer. This is also true for children, they are becoming more and more focused on things like the internet and video games that they are spending much less time outside and being active.",3 followers,Kaye Vasquez,4.8K,0,0,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-ways-in-which-technology-has-ruined-our-life

I was single, never married and was ambitious. I fell for the girl and we were an item for a while. I got serious about her and we started discussing our future together. However, being an Indian brahmin (an upper caste in the Indian caste system), there were bound to be issues marrying someone from another caste and her status. It didn’t bother me but it mattered a lot to my parents.When I brought up the news to my parents they resisted hard, including my own brother. I fought back harder and against everyone’s wishes I married this girl and was happy as one could be. Life couldn’t be better. She was a lovely human being and loved to take care of me. I reciprocated and helped her, it was a wonderful marriage. Both of us loved children and wanted to raise a family.After a couple of years of our marriage our parents accepted her and we moved close to them and life was wonderful. Great family, nicest neighbors and a good job.In the following years we had issues with having kids and she underwent severe mental trauma due this, not to mention a lot of treatments to assist with fertility. Some treatments are cruel, in my view, but essential for the purpose. I stood by her, supported her, went with her to all doctor’s appointments, traveled to temples & hospitals and provided a lot of moral comfort all along. Finally, all our efforts bore fruit when we had our first child, a beautiful girl which I had dreamed of.Two years later we had another girl, without any challenges and it looked like a real gift from God. We couldn’t have asked for more. I had promotion in my job and we were financially well off too.Fast forward another 6 years, we were in a foreign land now with an additional responsibility. My wife gave up her job to follow me to the new land. She fought her depression of being away from her family and having to manage two small children. But she stood by me to take on the new responsibility.Then, I got friendly with the wrong people and they introduced me to this sly world of meeting girls online to have side affairs. Immediately it looked wrong so I ignored; however the issue was I still met with these friends who were to be avoided. Over time when I kept hearing stories of their exploits I fell for the temptation and started dating women outside of my marriage. I was having an affair. I got a bit too deep in to a relationship with a woman and had a 2-year long affair before she went out of the country.My wife accidentally discovered this and her world came crashing down. She broke down, cursed and yelled and told me that I had ruined her life for good. What would happen to the children? What is our future? What was my plan?Honestly I hadn’t thought about anything. I still wanted my family, my children and my wife. I hadn’t fallen out of love but I thought I was having an adventure and it gave me kicks. Needless to say, the forbidden fruit tastes better but the after taste, is always bitter.She had looked up to me all these years as I was her friend, counsel, father of her children and a provider. Now, I fell totally in her sight and was a disgusting philanderer who was weak when it came to his lust. My family was pulled in to this issue and they broke their ties with us. They totally cut us off except for my father who gradually forgave me; however I lost the rest of them forever.My wife has since patched up with me and has graciously given me a second chance on the promise that I will clean up my act, all the while keeping this away from the children. She doesn’t want the children to hate me and also wants a normal family life for us.All said, I broke the faith of a genuinely wonderful human being who is my wife and shattered her life. She thought she had the perfect life - good life, beautiful & intelligent children, decent financial status and a great husband….but the last one was not to be and I was responsible for wreaking her beautiful life. Knowing that I can’t ever mend it and the damage is done forever, it kills me everyday.",4 followers,Matthew Bates,2.7K,9.8K,291.8M,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-ways-in-which-technology-has-ruined-our-life

Most are minor, as are the benefits of most technologies.Where it gets significant is with ""mighty"" technologies. Examples include nuclear power, AI, and genetic engineering.Nuclear power has led to enormous waste storage problems, and generations living in fear. AI could plausibly lead to mass unemployment and social disruption. Genetic engineering could lead to new kinds of pandemics worse than those of antiquity.Each of these, of course, also has enormous potential for good. Nuclear energy could be clean and abundant--especially if we finally walk ""the road not taken"" and embrace thorium power instead of uranium power, and/or fund the promising fusion solutions now available. AI's could provide the intelligence to quickly remedy all kinds of problems, and power robots that do all necessary work for us. Genetic engineering is already accomplishing cures for previously intractable genetic diseases.We need wisdom, and popular respect for wisdom, in order to ensure that mighty technologies are used for good. It will help if we create societies that provide conditions supportive of humans flourishing and taking the long view.When people are desperately trying to deal with needs that are lower on Maslow's Hierarchy (physiological and safety), they will grab at any plausible short-term solution. Wisdom looks at the long-term, larger context, and often gets drowned out by simplistic demagoguery when people are desperate for solutions.","246,666 followers",Dushka Zapata,1.5K,8.5K,231.7M,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-ways-in-which-technology-has-ruined-our-life

I don’t suggest you go to an ordinary American University to pursue an MEM. As long as you go to a top 10 MEM program your prospects are bright.The median salary for a Dartmouth MEM (A top 3 program at the very least) is around 75–80k dollars a year. For people without work experience, the salary is closer to 70K while students with solid work experience draw upwards of 85–90k. That number can fall to around 60k as well if you don’t go to a top rung MEM program. Choose wisely, and apply strong. It is preferable to enter MEM programs with smaller class sizes too.The MEM degree gives you more of a specialised skill set, making you a manager who takes decisions backed by sound numbers. In today’s age of data backed decision making, engineering managers are a supremely valuable asset. If you take the right electives as a part of your program you become an instantly hireable asset. A lot of applicants with significant work experience have started to apply to more specialised programs such as Engineering Management, Supply-Chain Management, Operations Management and Business Analytics instead of an MBA due to the skills these programs impart. Another reason for the popularity of the MEM is the fact that it is a STEM degree in the USA, hence making you eligible for a STEM extension and hence increasing the likelihood for an H1B visa.Engineering Management graduates take up careers as Business Analysts, Product Managers, Marketing analysts, Product Engineers and Management Consultants among a few.
