Those in extra curricular activities go for that. Maybe around 1% of the students actually open their books to study after lectures every single day.College Studies: Its quite less in comparison to your jee studies. Paying attention in lectures is quite enough to score well here.Now for the fun part:Hostel life: YouLife at Nit is pretty cool.

Paying attention in lectures is quite enough to score well here.Now for the fun part:Hostel life: Your hostel life will be quite a different experience. You won't love it at first but at the end of one year, you won't be able to do without it.Extra curricular activities: One of the best things is that if you're already into some extra curricular activities, you can always continue it here. Moreover if you want to learn something new, like a musical instrument or photography or even start playing a new game, you'll find enough of people ready to teach you.Fests: The fest time is truly a different experience. You cannot put it in words. During that time, its like the college never sleeps. Its enjoyment time every minute and every second.Traveling Culture: One of the best parts of my nit life are the road trips that we take with our friends. Also, once a year all the clubs and societies go out to a nearby hill station for enjoyment. During the trip you end up doing all sorts of things like rappling, trekking, river rafting, para-gliding and even cliff jumping.How hard does someone need to work? Well, you do need to work hard. If you're not doing well in your jee mock tests, you need to compensate that with your board marks.Inspiration? Well only one. Work hard enough for 2 years and you get 4 years of sheer enjoyment and a fair job at the end of the 4 years. Its worth it. I can assure you. So, just gear up these 2 years. Life will be so beautiful after that. All the best!","1,892 followers",Athanasios Canko,14.5K,318,2.9M,https://www.quora.com/How-are-your-studies-going-at-NIT

If you're obsessed with social media, no amount of studying may be useful.Hide your phone out of sight where you can't easily reach it.Eliminate all those things which distract you from studying.Socialising is important?Don't socialise too much. Avoid talking too much with your friends on phone. Keep yourself away from family discussions and don't get into arguments with brother/sister because it will only waste your time and energy.

Should I spend my 5000 on it or not ? But finally I wanted an online platform to study because in Gre, you have to sit for atleast 4.30 hours in front of the computer. So, you should have the practice of sitting that much in front of computer as well as the test interface,it is very much similar to the original gre Exam. Hence, while facing the exam you will find the interface very much friendly. It is also an advantage.I personally suggest to all the students to go with GREedge because it is the best online learning platform.","30,215 followers",Antariksh Bothale,2.1K,342,6.6M,https://www.quora.com/How-are-your-studies-going-at-NIT

Besides, they also give you detailed feedback on your performance(like areas where you are weak, time taken by you to answer different types of questions etc).The material provided by any coaching institution should be similar. To get good scores, it is not just about materials. It is more about organised study, focus on your weak areas and sufficient practices with actual exam timings. This is where the online coaching matters. It cuts down the amount of time that you have to spend on planning your study. Take my word for that, planning your preparation well is not a simple job if you want best scores. Also when there are deadlines on daily basis for minutely laid out targets, there is some kind of urgency and motivation to study.I cannot comment on other coaching institutions as I don‚Äôt have experience with them. But GREedge did a great job for me. I read many other answers before answering myself. I found both opinions on GREedge(on Quora, it is always like that on any topic!, lol).

This would be a way to duplicate some of the political constraints that our founding fathers faced, but of course, this could get controversial if the school principal happened to walk by as little Timmy rose from his seat as an esteemed delegate from Virginia in order to argue in favor of theThree-Fifths compromise. To defend his position he‚Äôd alsoUltimately, this racism was imbedded into the constitution, which we still face its consequences today, but although the constitution provided privilege to white men over the age of 21 who owned propertyWith that said, despite the educational value, high school students arguing in favor of slavery may be too controversial so the End of the Year Project may need to exist in an alternative universe where slavery never existed in the south so the students could debate other aspects of forming a new constitution such as separation of powers, bicameral legislature, implied powers, bill of rights, etc. Each delegation would then be graded based upon how well they communicated their views and represented their state‚Äôs interests. And then if the constitution tilts too much toward the interest of particular a colony or bloc of colonies then it might be wise for a colony to vote no on its ratification, which would be educational in of itself because it would show how fragile and difficult the constitution making process was.(As a side note in 2013, while I was in university I took a model congress class where I played Justin Amash. After studying his views, I was the only student to break from my party and declare myself an ‚Äúindependent‚Äù. 6 years later‚Ä¶ in the real-world‚Ä¶ Justin Amash declared himself an independent. When done right, these ‚Äúmodel‚Äù scenarios can duplicate real-world results.)BenefitsThis class would increase student‚Äôs critical thinking, communication skills, and knowledge of American history and law.The beauty of learning American history through our constitution is it brings the past into the present by discussing something that is very much relevant to our everyday lives.We currently have a crisis of patriotism in America and this class would be a rational way to stitch us back together so that before we are Republicans or Democrats, we are proud Americans.","105,633 followers",Dave Consiglio,5.2K,6.8K,91.4M,https://www.quora.com/How-is-GREedge-for-preparing-for-the-GRE-How-much-has-it-benefited-you-and-is-it-better-to-go-for-online-coaching-instead-of-classroom-learning

Then, the class would discuss ways to avoid ‚Äústicky situations.‚Äù Lastly, the students would be taught self defense moves & have to demonstrate them as the final test.I don't know if other high schools provide this class, but in this time, I can't help but feel self defense is crucial. Especially for women (and men!) who attend universities. In addition, self defense would probably be more likely to be used rather than the knowledge of what part of dirt a rock originated from.",4 followers,Britney Vu,870,670,10M,https://www.quora.com/What-is-something-that-should-be-taught-in-high-school-but-isn%E2%80%99t
17,"This may sound dark, but I think the proper measures one should take after rape ought to be taught in high school.Last week someone fairly close to me recounted her experience with rape to me. When she was 17 she hung out with a work colleague at times, and at one point the guy, who was 29 at the time, offered her very strong weed to smoke with him. She obliged, but the weed was so strong she became unwell. The guy offered her to come inside to take some sugar, which would help. He offered her a glass of lemonade, and she remarked that it tasted funny, but she assumed it was just old.

When she was 17 she hung out with a work colleague at times, and at one point the guy, who was 29 at the time, offered her very strong weed to smoke with him. She obliged, but the weed was so strong she became unwell. The guy offered her to come inside to take some sugar, which would help. He offered her a glass of lemonade, and she remarked that it tasted funny, but she assumed it was just old. The sugar helped, in any case.But then she woke up in his apartment the next morning, at 6 AM. She remembered nothing of the night. In an alarmed state, she went home, put her clothes in the washing machine, and went to take a shower. In other words, she disposed all evidence of a potential rape. Later the police did get involved, but obviously no evidence of a crime came to light. Her blood was also tested, but that was later, at which point only traces of cannabis use could be found.As a precautionary measure female interns were no longer allowed to work in this particular building, but since there was no actual evidence of a crime, the guy in question didn‚Äôt even get fired. Arguably that‚Äôs a good thing, as people should obviously be protected against unfounded rape allegations. But it‚Äôs a difficult situation either way.Now, had she been taught at school which measures she should have taken in her situation, she would presumably not have destroyed evidence of this (alleged) crime. She would also have known the protocols to follow and which people to contact.And indeed, she should also have been taught preventive measures. For example, do not drink strange tasting lemonade offered by an acquaintance! This situation may have been completely prevented had she been taught about these things. And if such a situation were to occur regardless, she would have been able to prove whether a crime was committed, and she would have been able to get better support.","105,633 followers",Dave Consiglio,814,6.8K,91.4M,https://www.quora.com/What-is-something-that-should-be-taught-in-high-school-but-isn%E2%80%99t
