If something broke too easily, or was just low quality garbage right out of the box, we would say “Made in Japan.” It wasn't long before that was no longer a joke, and by the 1990s we were all trying to learn the secrets behind Japanese success. People in the United States suddenly were eating sushi and reading ‘The Book of Five Rings’ because they figured there was some mystical Japanese samurai spirit to being successful.We wondered at how these drunk, karaoke singing, badly dressed, submissive worker ants from a tiny country whose ass we kicked only a few decades ago suddenly were on the verge of having the most powerful economy in the world.And Korea was desperately trying to catch up following the Japanese model, but their economy was so weak that the IMF had to take over. If you walked through Seoul in the late 1990s you would see signs on businesses noting IMF pricing. It was like the Red Cross coming to the rescue of catastrophic disaster victims. If you bought something there, it would disintegrate within a week, and you felt like an idiot for not spending the money for the Japanese item first on something you then had to buy twice.Meanwhile China was taking over the bulk of cheap manufacturing. It could have just as easily been Malaysia or the Philippines raking in the cheap manufacturing dollars, but it was China because they had a national plan and strategy. They didn't follow the Japanese model. They didn't worship Japan’s bubble economic success and all that came with it.At first it was all very simple stuff to make, with low quality materials, but now it's your iPhone. In fact now, if you're in Japan, the culturally iconic clothing of kimono, jinbei, geta, and so forth may be made in China because of Japan's desperate labor shortage and unwillingness to accept immigrants working in anything other than low pay, blue collar jobs. Japan resists diversity of talent, ideas, and particularly ethnicity. But not China, because China has always been diverse, has plenty of people.Fifteen years ago consumer technology in Japan was five to ten years ahead of any other country. It was the future. Now the world has certainly caught up, and China has found its second wind.I'm not saying China no longer makes cheap crap, or that the standard of living has surpassed Japan and Korea, but Korea is only about five years into making high quality manufactured goods, Japan has slowed down to a crawl and started falling behind, while Chinese have more new billionaires, has the most people traveling worldwide, and is experiencing rapid growth without the bubble.So maybe Chinese brand products aren't currently top quality, but you shouldn't be surprised if they are in as little as five years, and that they stay that way, because what China is doing right that Japan and the United States have done wrong is raised the overall prosperity of everyone in the country. Japan and the US care about the overall GDP, companies making money, the prosperity of the country itself and its business leaders. China on the other hand would like everyone in China to benefit, for everyone to prosper, so that no one is dependent or subservient to their employer or the state. It's a key cultural difference.",0 followers,Flora Ding,2.4K,352,5.1M,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-good-computer-tricks-that-are-not-commonly-known

Just for the sake of argument, is there a number which if subtracted from its square happens to equal exactly 1, even though the number itself is irrational?  Turns out there is.  We'd write this as:x^2 - x = 1If we solve forAnd there's a bit more.  Before I defined the Fibonacci Sequence as starting at 0.  But in fact, you can generate a Fibonacci Sequence starting with any 2 numbers.  Suppose you start with:19 and 782.  Then the next term is 801, then 1583, then 2384, then 3967.

Start near one end of the board, and line up the 3"" mark on one side, and the 9"" mark on the opposite side. The distance between those divisions is exactly 6"". So, move 3"" from either side and put a mark halfway (6"").Now move the ruler toward the opposite end. Here, you could line up the 6"" mark on one side, and the 12"" mark on the other. The distance between the 2 is 6"", and half that is exactly 3"". Make a mark at 9"". Doesn't matter what divisions you use, as long as you can calculate the halfway point precisely.
