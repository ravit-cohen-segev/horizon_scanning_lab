There were some space frogs.These space frogs had psychic powers, but unlike your typical psychic powers in science fiction and fantasy, these powers were derived from something called the Sea of Souls, which is where all of our thoughts and emotions go and create things,Anyways. These space frogs were called The Old Ones, and they had all this super cool tech and powers that they used to travel the stars and create life, well, a couple thousand millennia later, another species, called the Necrontyr appeared. Their planet was a hell hole bombarded by radiation from their sickly dying. Star. Suffice to say, they got very depressed about death since they died at like, 30. To take their minds off that, they decided to go all “SPACE EMPIRE TIME!! YAAAAY”Well, that was all well and good for a couple millennia, then all the various kings and dynasty’s in the Necrontyr empire got pissy about dying, and got even more pissy that the Space Frogs wouldn’t fix their lifespan and make the Necrontyr immortal like the space frogs.(The space frogs thought the Necrontyr were a bit dickish, and were like “nah, I ain’t giving you angry bois anything)So, the Necrontyr decided to fight the space frogs…..and got beat like a 5 year old challenging a professional MMA fighter. So, to even the score, they captured these sentient space gas monsters called the C’tan (which were also the reason their star was killing them) in metal suits to use their star eating powers to help them.The C’tan lied and tricked the Necrontyr into feeding most of their souls to the C’tan, who then turned the Necrontyr into Terminators/space Egyptians now, apparently the C’tan thought Necrontyr was a mouthful, so now they’re the Necrons.With their new terminator armies the necrons began kicking ass, so, the space frogs decided to genetically engineer some aliens to fight for them.Enter, the Aeldari (read, space elves), and, the Krork, (read space orcs, but bigger with power armor)These guys fight the necrons for millions of years, but the details are sparse, eventually, the Necrons and C’tan win! Sort of, most of the space frogs are dead, and the Aeldari and Krorks are on the retreat (some weird space squids contributed to the retreat, but let’s not talk about that) So, the Necrons decide, “Screw the C’tan, let’s kill em” and they do! Then they decide to hibernate for a little while (read millions upon millions of years)Now, with no war, the Aeldari, kinda lost and purposeless decide “SPACE EMPIRE TIME!! YAAAY!!”So they do that for a while,Also, remember that Sea of Souls thing? Yeah, it’s also how everyone travels through spaceAnd that war between the Necrons and space frogs, it f**ked that s**t up.Anyways, the Aeldari because they have so much mental influence in the Sea of Souls (from now on called The Warp for convenience) that they now have gods made from their emotions! Yay! Except their god of war decided to kill a bunch of themYeah, not a pleasant fellaWell, after this guy killed a couple billion Aeldari, the gods decided to lock him up and retreat back into the warp so as to not interfere with the Aeldari.BIGWith the gods gone it only took a few millennia for the Aeldari to go nuts, and some priests started saying, “hey, there’s a new god that’s going to be born, let’s help it along by being a bunch of BDSM sweat goblins”Suffice to say, there was a considerable portion that were not okay with that, they abandoned the empire and settled into a farming All Natural Existence With Dinosaur pets*tm, they became known as the ExoditesAfter a while things in The Warp started getting nasty. Warp storms began to plague the universe disrupting travel for everyone and making things aweful.Right before the end, a bunch of Aeldari decided to skip out on the sweat goblin nonsense in gigantic moon sized spaceships, these guys we shall refer to as the Eldar.Now, it’s close to show time, the new god is about to be born!! The Murdurizing, sweat goblin BDSM orgy has all been leading to this! Happy Birthday!Slaanesh, The Dark Prince, the Mistress of Pain and PleasureOh boy, that’s, not what we expected now was it. Well, when thisAnyways, Slaanesh now joined in with the other three, not Aeldari gods, Creating the great Quadrarchy of Chaos, let’s meet them shall we?Khorne! Lord of war, battle, bloodshed, and rage!! (He has a skull fetish and sits on a throne made of them)Papa Nurgle! Master of rot, decay, and pestilence! (He’s got a thing for infecting his followers with every disease ever, and then making them immortal, fun times to be a walking rotting pus bag)Then my personal favorite, the inept Mollusk himself, TZEENTCH!! Lord of Change and Sorcery, the great schemer! (Just get used to your body constantly mutating under you and you’ll be fine)Together with Slaanesh and the new portal to the universe, they now begin to royally screw everyone in existence.In other news, some of you may be wondering what happened to the Aeldari that didn’t escape the sweat goblin orgy. Well, they never stopped, now they adapted it so that they could murdurize/orgify everything they do to avoid having their souls eaten by Slaanesh. Meet the Drukhari of Commoragh,Ain’t he a handsome fella!now, before we continue in the fustercluck that is the universe, we need to backtrack 31,000 years, to earth, in the year 8,000BCIn a little valley in Asia Minor, a group of Psykers, (those humans who can harness powers out of the warp, like the space frogs and Aeldari) decided to commit mass suicide so that their souls might join together and create a super being that could fend off the predations of chaos, thus, the greatest mortal being to ever be was created.The glorious Man Manperor of MankindHe spent the first few thousand years founding every religion we know of as an attempt to draw worship away from chaos to try and starve it, this went, ok. Eventually, several thousand years in our future, humanity decided to go “SPACE EMPIRE TIME! YAAAY” and built the Human federation, yaaay! All the while that glorious golden figure pictured above stayed in the shadows. Eventually, we got lazy and built some sentient robots, well, say it with me “the AI decided to over throw humanity” only difference is that it was the fault of the chaos gods this time. thus began the wars with The Men of Iron.Quite the jovial servant unit isn’t itThese went on for a few thousand years and caused much death and destruction, but the humans won. Yaaay! Just in time for the Aeldari to start murder f**king Slaanesh into existence. You remember the warp storms that preceded its birth? They destroy the human federation, and thus begins the long night, where humanity descends into an age of savagery and darkness, it’s empire disconnected and collapsed.Jump forward to the late 20,000’s AD and brilliant golden man, (referred to as The Emperor from here for convenience) has decided, “SCREW THIS, I’m taking over” and he does, he builds an army of super soldiers called the Thunder WarriorsBig flag manTo conquer earth, and he succeeds! Yaaay! And then he kills all the thunder warriors because,So, now that earth is conquered, he goes off and adds the Moon and Mars to the list of his imperial territory. We welcome the Cult Mechanicus of Mars!Yeah, these guys have a habit of replacing their body parts with machines and worship a C’tan that they don’t know is a C’tan, fun!At this point The Emperor (from now on to be referenced as Big E) decides that he doesn’t have the ability to conquer the galaxy on his own and creates,0: If King Arthur Stole Mowgli’s Origin Story!1: Hugo Boss1: Petulant Babo0: Getting Jiggy with Ghengis0: Lief Ericsson1: Unresolved Trauma Man/Batman0: Jesus0: FLESH IS WEAK1: I HAVE NAILS IN MY HEAD!!!

Well, eventually the emperor starts gathering them up, and they wage a war of conquest to make mankind the dominant species in the galaxy. They fight everybody! Space chimps, Eldar, Drukhari, and remember the krorks? Well, now, after millions of years of decay, they are now the Orks, basically Green skinned English Football fans that have technology that works just because they think it willWAAAAAAGGHHHHthese guys have populated huge chunks of the galaxy and have developed an entire KULTUR around fightingAnyways, as this great crusade continues across the galaxy, The Emperor picks up the super sons, who now lead legions of Thunder Warrior Mk.2 “more stable edition” called SPEEEHHHHSSS MAHREEENNNSWait, that’s not right, too shiny and cleanThere we gooo!Anyways, this goes on for several years, but problems are opening up with the super sons, Billy Graham has taken to worshiping The Emperor And has slowed down the crusade. The Emperor destroys his favorite planet in an attempt to get him back in line, instead, Billy Graham goes over to the other extreme and begins worshiping chaos! YAAAY!Anyways, long story short, remember back at the super sons, the guys with a 1 in front of their name all decided to follow Billy Graham for one reason or another and destroy the Imperium that The Emperor has been building , with Sir Gullible in the lead! This is a big long chunk of super detailed stuff…..so let’s skip it! To cut a long story short the emperor is mortally wounded, but the bad super sons are all forced into the warp or dead. Over the next few centuries all the good super sons end up dead or in strange predicaments, or both. This leaves the Imperium of Man (human civilization) in a bit of a bind, and they devolve into a horrific mass of fascism on steroids and extreme police state paranoia, but that’s actually necessary to survive now that Chaos and the aliens are on the rise. Anyways, jump forward to the 41st millennium, and things are going to hell, Humanity is slowly decaying as Chaos gains strength. Add to this, the Tyranids!An endless swarm of space roaches that have only just barely entered the galaxy with their scouts, and are eating everybody for lunch….literally.Anywho, there’s a bunch of details in here, but that’s what the books are forJump forward to the start of the 42nd millennium and Chaos has decided to say F**k you! And split the galaxy in half with a massive warp rift like the eye of terror on steroids, Rowboat Girlyman is back to try and fix things, and everything has gone a bit strange.Welcome to Warhammer 40kEdit 1:Also there are some blue space communist weebs that come in two flavors!Ethereal Blue RaspberryAnd Farsight Fire CherryThis answer took me several days spread over several weeks to complete, and was done using almost no source material to add to comedic affect.

There wasn’t much detail about genetic changes to turn them into Superhumans (although that *did* come quite shortly after, as it’s covered in one of the first ever supplements) other than some bio-chem enhancements and the black carapace allowing them to interface with their armour. There’s even a full-page piece of artwork featuring “Imperial Commander” Marneus Calgar, Lord Macragge, Each chapter was led by an Imperial Commander, as opposed to a Chapter Master. Chapters were still limited to 1000 fighting marines. Colour schemes and iconography for a few of the chapters we know today were introduced, including the Blood Angels, Ultramarines, Space Wolves, Crimson Fists, Iron Hands, White Scars (“Whitescars” at the time) and Dark Angels.The Imperium stood pretty much as it does now, with the corpse-Emperor on the Throne powering the Astronomican, and being kept alive by the sacrifice of many psykers daily. However, the lore about the Horus Heresy came later (in one of the two Realms of Chaos volumes, if I remember correctly) - and even then, Horus was just an Imperial Commander, not a Primarch yet. The Emperor was confined to his Throne due to the strain of ten thousand years of building the Imperium and holding off psychic threats from warp space taking its toll on his body.There was an Adeptus Mechanicus (although no mention of Mars - in fact they’re referred to as the “guardians of Earth’s ancient technogical past”), Adeptus Custodes (although they wore pointy helmets and cloaks, not power armor), Adeptus Arbites, Adeptus Astronomica, Adeptus Astra Telepathica, Legiones Astartes, Imperial Army, Imperial Navy, Rogue Traders, Inquisition, etc.As there hadn’t been a Horus Heresy, the concept that would become Chaos Marines was just Traitor Marines that’d gone rogue, becoming pirates and suchlike. Something that was far more likely then as their indoctrination process hadn’t been defined.The Eye of Terror is still mentioned, as a dangerous part of space that you don’t want to get too close to.Abhumans were around in force - Beastmen, Squats, Ogryns, Halflings (now Ratlings)The Eldar (Aeldari now) were around in a fairly similar form to now, but there were no Dark Eldar (Drukhari). There were mentions of “Eldar Pirates”, though, which presumably evolved later into the Dark Eldar. Warp gates within each craftworld were mentioned, which would in later editions form the basis of the Webway.The Jokaero were in the 1st edition too, and haven’t really changed since.Genestealers were mentioned as being from Ymgarl. They were not retconned into being Tyranid vanguard organisms until later on, although the Tyranids were also part of lore at the time - along with one of their slave races, the Zoats.The Slann were featured as the most ancient race, and seemed quite active.Orks were, well, Orks. Although they hadn’t yet gotten tribes. Their smaller cousins, the Gretchin, were also there.“Warp Space” allowed for faster travel between worlds, and (for Humanity, at leaest) still required a Navigator and the Astronomican. It was home to strange, dangerous, psychically-attuned creatures such as the Astral Hound, Astral Spectre, and Psychneuein - no mention yet of chaos, although demon-like creatures called “Warp Entities” are there and manifest themselves in our reality through psychic possession, destroying the host in the process.The Inquisition were special agents of the Imperium, who rooted out traitors, cults, and rogue psykers - so pretty much unchanged, really.Looking for Chaos, Tau, Necrontyr? You’re out of luck, they didn’t exist yet!At the end of the book was an example scenario featuring the remnants of the Crimson Fists just after the destruction of their Space-Monastery, as they encounter an Ork patrol on their trek across Rynn’s World (there were even counters to play the battle with so you wouldn’t have to go buy a bunch of minis right away!) - something that has gone pretty much unchanged ever since, to the point that it’s now a major part of 40K history (and the invasion of Rynn’s World forms a big part of GW’s latest game, the new edition of Aeronautica Imperialis!)",434 followers,Andreas Buehler,844,3.4K,2.2M,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-basic-lore-for-Warhammer-40k

And the silliness that arises out of that is a saving grace for the game, in my humble opinion.

That doesn’t make them the good guys.The idea of Order and Chaos that Warhammer relies on so much is taken from the writing of Michael Moorcock, who was actually listed as an inspiration in the earliest books.

All things we typically think of as good, but which are bad if taken to unhealthy extremes.The Necrons are a race of mechanical beings with a strict social hierarchy. This is built into their very “biology”, as a Necron’s social status in life determined the nature of their mechanical bodies. The highest rank Necrons received advanced bodies that could retain all of their memories, personalities and emotions. The lowest rank did not, and are little more than automatons.This dehumanization is a hallmark of Order gone wrong.But Order is also a metaphysical concept. Order represents adherence to the laws of physics. And out of all the races in the 40K universe, none have mastered the physical realm like the Necrons.Their technology is millions of years more advanced than anyone else. They can move stars around at their whim. And they do it all without relying on the Warp, psykers or any sort of “magic”. Because the Necrons literally don’t have souls, they are purely physical beings, and represent the “science” in Warhammer’s “science fantasy”.This inability to use “magic” is a hallmark of Order in the metaphysical sense.But the Necrons are also taking center stage as the villains of 9th edition. Partially this is because in the stories that inspired Warhammer neither Order nor Chaos are truly good nor truly evil. They’re just incomplete ways of looking at the universe, and good exists in their balance.And mostly this is because in Warhammer there are no good guys.

He's afflicted withThis page clipped from Action Comics #3, page 4 is shown quoting Jor-El's considerable intellectual capacity.DC has defined Jor-El and Lara being lead scientists on the planetary Science Council.Defining Intellect in the DC UniverseThe DC Universe has never really known how to address their descriptions of intellectual capacity in an objective level. The DCU is littered with a variety of geniuses at varying levels of intellectual capacity and development. I think they should just use the I.Q. scale like everyone else but I suspect comic book genius renders the normal IQ scale less than ideal.Lady Shiva, in some iterations of the DC Universe, she was THE hand to hand combatant to beat. She defeated Batman in almost every conflict they ever had. She was basically undefeated and the most terrifying martial artist in the DC Universe. Yes, I call that a form of genius.A holdover from the previous DC UniverseOne such measuring tool was the use of the ""genius levels of intellect"" scale rated from one to twelve, with twelve being the maximum. Yes, there are rumors of a 16th level intellect but canon writings only take the scale to 12. Given the difficulties in determining how such intellects are rated:The five markers set down by DC in the previous continuities of the DC Universe were:Given these ratings and the recent reveal that Jor-El is at least an 8th level intellect and considered by ""The Collector"" to be Krypton's leading scientific mind, and Lara was also considered a first rate scientist on Krypton, this means Kal-El has the genetic potential to be considered a genius of that order.Assuredly with his mind's enhancement under a yellow sun, he is certain capable of being one of the most intelligent beings on the DC Earth. His greatest weakness is likely a lack of significant exposure to information and education to challenge his intellect to achieve its greatest state.In the modern DC Universe, Superman has been shown to use his natural aptitutes for skill acquisition and super computation in addition to a genius-level aptitude with using his powers and abilities.Is Superman's thinking affected by his powers?In the canon DC Universes, Superman's raw intelligence is considerable but rarely challenged. Kal-El is the son of two of Krypton's top scientists but his time on Earth, in most continuities, he is not challenged to utilize his super-intellect to its greatest capacity.One of the greatest standard display of his super-intellect is his Fortress of Solitude.Post-Crisis SupermanSuperman, as he has been written from the Post Crisis Era to the last iteration of the DC Universe, was not considered to have as great a superhuman intellect. The early Post-Crisis version of the character by John Byrne was meant to emphasis the MAN, not the SUPER, so his life as Clark Kent was the focus of these early stories.His current Fortress is still an impregnable stronghold filled with technology from all over the galaxy. While he may not be considered a super-genius, his ability must be significant enough he is able to rebuild and maintain his Kryptonian stronghold on Earth.That said, it is obvious that his natural abilities far exceed a Human's for a variety of reasons he displays every time he uses his powers.In SummaryApocrypha: All-Star SupermanPeople often look at the graphic novel/movie version of ""All-Star Superman"" as a sample of Superman utilizing his superhuman intellect. While he does use his abilities to their fullest there, this particular Superman is an Elseworlds version of the character, not a mainstream continuity version.

Theres a scene where Alex, pilot of the Roscinante, is sitting in his ship idling while the crew are away on a surface mission. He gets bored, cracks a beer and lets fluid float off. Then launches himself off the stairs in a zero g flip trying to catch the beer in his mouth. Its a silly scene but its a fun one, and serves to demonstrate the lack of gravity can actually be an interesting plot point. It doesnt get it all right. They wear magnetic boots, but you don’t see their hair waving around wildly due to having no downward pull. Its a minor point, and its understandable that they handwave it away, for the purposes of keeping in budget and not having the actors look like high-tech hobos.The show has other interesting realistic features too. The ships tend to respect orbital mechanics (and use these to good effect in space battles). Often when a battle breaks out, the crew have to throw on their helmets so the ship can decompress. This is so that if a bullet pierces the ship the crew aren’t subjected to sudden decompression forces.So yeah, the Expanse proved that doing physics (mostly) realistically doesn’t make for bad television. So the question is, why don’t the other shows?And yeah, unrealistic gravity is probably the least of Star Treks problems. FTL travel, transporters, Mystery particle of the week plots, and straight up gibberish on the bridge is only the beginning.

An alien ecosystem is likely to wreak havoc on the average human, particularly if the atmosphere is close enough to human compatible that it supports life dependent on the same chemicals as ours. Just breathing the air is likely to trigger fatal anaphylaxis as our immune system freaks out from inhaling airborne biologicals.Then there’s quarantine. I can’t drive from one end of Australia to the other without disposing of any fruit and vegetables I might be carrying. I can’t take wood products into the country without serious certification. In fact, you can’t even enter Australia without certifying that you are not carrying any bees or beekeeping equipment with you.Why? More to the point, who carries bees on a plane?Biosecurity is the answer (not the carrying bees question, I don’t know the answer to that). Apart from all the appalling pests we deliberately introduced, Australia is remarkably isolated from other ecosystems. A new parasite or insect could destroy major parts of our ecosystem, much as the introduction of rabbits in a place where they had no natural predators and so bred out of control, or the poisonous cane toads that were introduced to control sugar cane beetles (they didn’t, they eat other native frogs, and anything that tries to eat them dies). With the bees, Australia is the only continent (apart from Antarctica - that doesn’t count) not to host the devastating varroa mite which is currently destroying bee populations throughout the world.The human body contains literally tens of trillions of microorganisms - bacteria, viruses, fungi, archaea, and so on. Any transference of biological material could be a disaster. The microorganisms on a single exhaled breath could be enough to create a cascading ecological catastrophe in an alien ecosystem. A drop of saliva, a spill of blood, sweat, anything that comes from the human body could be the start of an ecocide.God help you if you take a crap on an alien planet. That biological transference is a two-way street, remember.I don’t have a problem with this in most space operas.But something aspiring to even a bit of realism?

Given that this is supposed to be science fiction, this causes problems.The first episode hints at the show’s basic outline; earth was destroyed/badly damaged by a mystery object that did unspecified things to the air. A big interstellar ship was built to evacuate a chosen few and the big ship was conveniently equipped with dozens of escape pods that are also self-contained saucer ships. Unexplained alien robots show up and start killing the crew for no reason, so the ship goes to warp/explodes and the Robinson’s escape pod/ship are flung to parts unknown.A bit sketchy, but not irredeemably so.Their escape pod/ship collides with the alien’s ship as it enters the atmosphere of an uncharted planet and ends up skidding across beautiful snow-capped mountains. Because the ship is made of unobtanium it and the crew survive an uncontrolled re-entry and supersonic collision with a literal mountain because main characters don’t die, that’s why.(Mach 7 to this? Didn’t even scratch the paint.)This is familiar territory for Star Wars/Trek fans, but things go rapidly downhill from here.Rather than assess the spaceship that’s keeping them alive, the crew decides now would be a great time to go for a walk. In the course of doing so we find out this space ship doesn’t have airlocks, it just has big single doors that jam half open. This point is doubly made when the ship suddenly breaks through the top of the icy mountain into a mountain lake and promptly sinks like a stone. Because drama, that’s why! The Titanic apparently had more water/air tight doors than this space ship.Now stuck on a mountain top in the falling afternoon light, the crew decides to take off their space suits, why not, and go retrieve a power cell so they don’t freeze to death during the night. After some contrived drama regarding Will Robinson’s performance under pressure, one of his sisters suits up and swims down into the lake to get the battery. This is swiftly accomplished without any depth related concerns (because reasons!) but on her way back to the surface with the battery, the entire mountain lake suddenly and inexplicable freezes solid from top to bottom in about ten seconds, trapping her in ice, because drama.To freeze one gram of zero-degree water you must remove 333.55 joules of energy from it.To freeze a gallon of water, 1,262,620.17 joules of energy must be given off.The energy given off by 100 gallons of freezing water is about the same as a burning gallon of gasoline.Freezing an Olympic swimming pool gives off the same energy as burning 6600 gallons of gas or 833,329,312,200 joules.At a conservative estimate, the lake has at least the same surface area as 16 Olympic pools and is a minimum of 10 deep.Freezing 160 Olympic pools forces out 133,332,689,952,000 joules, or 133 terajoules.The nuclear bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki were 63 and 84 terajoules respectively.So one Robinson is trapped in ice and all the others are violently vaporized along with a substantial chunk of the mountain in a massive explosion.Except this doesn’t happen because the writers have apparently never seen water before and don’t understand how it works.Yeah.Moving On!Mom Robinson points out that the nearby mountain is on fire because the entire thing is made of un-burned magnesium and also, the air is rich in oxygen. Despite the ridiculous impossibility of this, the crew rolls with it and goes to gather a bucket full to melt a chunk of the lake and free their crewmate. While scraping at a deposit that couldn’t be more than a few hours old, Will Robinson goes slipping down a ‘main character’ slide that’s exactly the right size and length to quickly move him off the mountains and below the snow line so he can go have other adventures by himself in the forest while whining about how unworthy he is.(Welcome to set two.)While they’re gone, Mom Robinson must undergo emergency surgery at the hands of one of her daughters because drama! But that’s not enough drama on its own, so the surgery is carried out by the untrained daughter while the medically trained daughter remains frozen in magic ice. Double the drama!On the return of John Robinson, the crew use the magnesium shavings to burn a hole into the ice and expose the gloved hand of their trapped daughter whose air is running out. At this point a simple knife cut, some glue and a long plastic tube would ensure she has all the air she needs, but the crew elects to continue dropping burning metal onto her instead.As the temperature falls to -60 °C, their efforts are suddenly thwarted by magic rain that instantly turns to ice, but only after it fills up the hole they’ve dug. Drama! Instead of pulling the tent over the hole and continuing, the crew wail and gnash their teeth at the unbearable feelings this is calling up in all of them.Meanwhile on set two (sorry willing suspension of disbelief, I wanted it to work but we have irreconcilable differences), Will Robinson wanders off through the forest and finds the crashed alien ship they ran into on their way down. A pair of robot feet chase him through the woods and into a tree where he finds the top half of the robotic humanoid alien. As the alien looks scary and doesn’t speak English, he decides his best course of action is to sit around having feelings and looking anguished.Fortunately for everyone, the rest of the main characters (who can’t die—they’re on contract for more episodes) still need help from the robot on set one up in the mountains, so the entire forest on set two catches fire, why not. The magic fire which produces no smoke gets closer and closer until Will decides in a fit of feelings that he is doomed, dooooomed, and that if he can’t escape alive he might as well save the scary robot by cutting the soft branch it’s top half is stuck on. Apparently, no one told the robot that it’s sharp claws could cut wood.At any rate, the scary alien robot reassembles its two parts, decides it loves humans now, and proceeds to rush up the mountain side with Will to rescue his wailing family. Using its magic robot heat hands it applies enough heat to melt sister Robinson out of 8 feet of ice in three seconds, thus simultaneously cooking, boiling, irradiating her and setting her on fire.But main characters can’t die, so she’s like, fine.The first episode ends with everyone gathering round the robot as it heats them all with its magic hands.",UNKNOWN,Michelle - MAD PIRATE QUEEN,4.4K,4.2K,68.6M,https://www.quora.com/How-smart-is-Superman-Does-he-have-the-potential-to-be-super-intelligent

It's one of my favorite episodes, yes, but after living and seeing the concept repeated and repeated, it gets old.) as did it's modern-day analog Black Mirror in “U.S.S Callister”. “I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream” ran with the concept of absolute power in a crapsack world, not to mention Game of Thrones.But the real reason I'm bringing this up is because of the apparent ethos for why this trope is so commonly played out, best articulated in the below interview:The Boys' Showrunner Wants It to Be 'the Most Brutally Realistic Depiction of Superheroes'Those powerful forces are superheroes who represent the worst of humanity’s collective id. “So, overall, what we’re really trying to do is [ask] what is the most brutally realistic depiction of superheroes in the real world?” Kripke said. “And with superheroes as insecure and fucked up and self-serving and selfish as real humans really would be if given superpowers, they’d all be super Bill Cosby. Sick. So...did I say something? Was that too soon? Too soon for all you fucking Bill Cosby fans in the audience?”Kripke… j-just stop.For what it's worth, I've heard that the actual TV showThat's enough philosophizing for me. Now, it's time to introduce an alternative.Meet minus. Yes, that is her name, and yes, it is always lowercase.And it's probably the greatest webcomic ever made.minus is a webcomic about a girl with phenomenal, cosmic, godlike power. For literallyAnd what does she do with it?Well, stuff like this.She is, after all, a child.minus is probably the closest to the Twilight Zone episode “A Good Life” I mentioned. Everything minus does isn’tGee, that escalated quick.But still, the comic isn’t “grim”. It isn’t “dark”. It’s about a kid with reality-warping powers. Sometimes she uses them selfishly, as a child is wont to do, but like mostAnd have a little fun in the process.Again, she’s a child.This is, in my opinion, the most realistic of the whole “Oh, person gets phenomenal godlike power! What will they do with it?!” trope I’ve seen thus far. This is exactly how I would expect a real life child to behave if given this power.And frankly, I’d be fine with that. I wouldn’t live in fear or eternal dread. I’d just be like… okay. It might be weird the first time I see her turn a bully into a tree and not change them back, or take a friend’s request to be sent 80 years into the past literally. But it’s never malicious. It’s seldom vindictive. It’s usually harmless. And it’s always cute. Kids aren’t naturally malicious. People won’t give up all morals and ethics when given power.And sometimes a reality-warping girl will turn all human life into ghosts. What’re you going to do, really?And that was where I wanted to end the answer, but I feel like enough justice hasn’t been done to explain why this comic brings such powerful emotions up in my chest.That’s probably because the original author hasn’t been heard from since 2016, and the website that once hosted the comics is stillborn. The comic itself ended long before that, but still… it just hurts. It hurts to see the one kindhearted depiction of a child with these powers fade into obscurity.If I’m the only one out there to spread the good word of minus, then so be it. Let this answer be a small offering that will keep this lovely comic from going gently into the goodnight of being forgotten to time.If you liked this wonderful answer, maybe you’ll likeIt’s a science-fiction/fantasy adventure with mystical powers and jokes and video games and battles and stuff!

This room has exactly the same function as the one I picked from ‘The Martian’, it is the exercise room. Notice how there are packets on the walls storing stuff, and things are compact and made to fold up to be put away?Naturally there are exceptions to this rule in movies…A spacecraft designed as a hotel would obviously be all about space and aesthetics.A work trip to Mars, though… no.Addition:Several people point out the lengths of time are different and the mental state should be considered…The amount of space for the ISS crew member would have worked just as well in centriptal acceleration (artificial gravity) as it would have in free fall (zero gravity)As for mental state, crew are exerted to psychological and wellbeing studies even before they get on the ship… it is likened to being on a submarine (or some ships) a situation studied extensively in the navy over extremelly long periods… and they have the same living issues with gravity included but no nice views.

Like,The opposite problem happens in some, like Star Wars. The turning point for me to leave Star Wars behind from the latest set of movies was actually the over-diversity of the alien species overwhelming Maz Kanata's castle.They’re obviously trying to recreate another cantina scene, but after the first Star Wars movie set (episode 4–6), the expanded universe largely tried to keep to these aliens that we initially saw, diving into their culture, their home worlds, unique abilities, etc. And it took decades to cover that ground.All of the sudden, we get an explosion of more aliens showing up, and then some more in the next, in the same instance George Lucas got a hold of computer-generated tech and vomited ungodly amounts of new aliens all over the place wherever he could. The problem this presents is… all of these alien species are unique creatures, but they’re set up as some kind of ultra-singular 1:1:1:1:1:1:1:1:1:2:2:3:4 ratio of uniqueness or close (except humans). On top of that, they all exist on the exact same atmosphere without problem. Even if each of these aliens shared a home planet with one other intelligent life form, we would get hundreds of home worlds.And yet, all of them work with and developed the same technology. They all breathe each other’s atmospheres… unless they’re droids, they breathe period. None of them are overly superior or inferior in technology over the other. We clearly see them convening on the same location, so all of them had to get there by space travel at some point.And like I said, not just the variety of aliens, but variety in technology is almost always lacking. I applaud those sci-fi franchises that can implement a strong sense of interesting diversity in it’s elements when different species come together. There’s a multitude of theories and possibilities on things like weapon usage, which shapes battle doctrines, and FTL travel methods.We should see something unusual and exotic like Japanese Samurai fighting a Spartan Hoplite, or as weird as rabid archer squirrels teaming up with hornets the size of lemons to fight against an invasion of anthropomorphic lawn mowers and vacuum cleaners.",0 followers,Dylan Owens,15.7K,271,26.8M,https://www.quora.com/Which-unrealistic-science-fiction-tropes-annoy-you-the-most-Why

Think about the dumpster fires that are the new Disney-madeI deal primarily in self defense firearms training, I was a black belt, a decent high school wrestler, and now I do primarily weightlifting and BJJ. I am neither tough nor have I ever hit an intimate partner (especially a woman). All that said, what I'm about to say is very important: women now no longer understand how much stronger men are as a gender. Hell, half of America doesn't even recognize what gender is. If you are a woman who believes that gender is just some made up, oppressive tool of the evil patriarchy, why wouldn't you take it a step further and attack men like all the cool women you idolize on TV?Recently, I've been watchingI can appreciate the willing suspension of disbelief needed to enjoy a good fantasy/sci-fi story. If it happens on a parallel planet or world, away from Earth's laws, where dragons fly, I suppose it is completely harmless to pretend that your average female knight can just beat up the Tolkien Middle Earth equivalent of a SEAL Team 6 veteran with Tim Kennedy's combat skills. After all, we all just watchedIn actuality this is very dangerous.I'm meeting women who are legitimately coming to my store saying things like this: “I don't want a gun because guns are dangerous. What I need is a knife. If a man is trying to hurt me, I can claw and fight him off and then get to a knife and kill him.” Well, ladies, if stopping rape with an edged weapon was that easy I'm sure it would be common practice by now. Edged weapons have been around about as long as rape has been. If you could just pull out a knife and stop a rapist, then 12% of the world's population wouldn't have Genghis Khan's DNA.If that's not bad enough, I'm seeing a marked increase in women who want training after they acted up in a bar fight and someone disabused them of the notion that “women are just as strong as men"" in a very savage way. I've seen recent surveillance footage of women now instigating fights against men twice their size, with no real thought to the consequences. When they end up sailing back across the room thanks to a punch or a good, hard slap, they can't figure out what happened and immediately start crying (IF they are still conscious).Ladies, please, for your own safety let me use the little kid from“The day I can push something the size of a basketball out of my netherworld, I'll concede your point. Until that day, just assume that nature has bestowed upon males certain inherent physiological advantages that make them much, much more likely to beat the ever-loving shit out of you in combat than the other way around. You are not Ronda Rousey. Ronda Rousey's own mother was on record multiple times as saying that she wouldn't stand a chance in a fight against a male fighter. Yes, I'm aware that some women on planet earth are stronger or better with submissions than some men. This is not news to me.You are not that woman.The number of women who could actually beat up a moderately strong, 20-45 year old man who knows how to wrestle and fight is down to the single digits, if at all.Just because a female superhero you love can beat up a bad guy by punching him in the nuts (because of course, that always works in Hollywood in 2019) doesn't mean that you should just attack a man when you get angry with him. A man who is tuned up, who keeps himself in decent shape, who is in the prime of life, and who is angry, is not going to just fall over when you punch him in the balls. I'm sorry. Our testicles shrink or expand based off a variety of factors for a variety of reasons. The male species doesn't just have his penis and testes exposed for someone to smash in a fight. While it is vulnerable, it is nowhere near as vulnerable an area as Hollywood would have you believe. Watch a boxer take aThe easiest way to prove my broader point is to ask women who believe this malarkey a very simple question: Are women tough enough that they can do anything a man can do? If so, then why do we need to make sure and protect women from men who beat them? Either we all are equal, or else we aren't. If women are just as strong as men then you don't need special protection under the law from abusive male lovers or things like battered women's shelters. If women can protect themselves then why should men never be allowed to hit them in a fight?If you want me to teach men not to hit women, that's okay. I'm all for that. That's what good men have taught our sons for two millennia without feminists harping at us or sermonizing to us. However, I tell women that the one good part of getting hit in the face is that it is a very good reminder to you not to do or say dumb shit again in the future.

It took very long to learn and other students stuck to print writing once we were not forced to use cursive.I’m a bit rusty now, but here’s an example:",3 followers,Sandeep Chaudhary,2.4K,207,2.4M,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-basic-lore-for-Warhammer-40k
