This is true, but out of the 7 billion people of earth, how many see our country as horrible? Is it 1%... 70 million people? Have Indonesian leaders over the last seven decades committed serious crimes against humanity?

This is true, but out of the 7 billion people of earth, how many see our country as horrible? Is it 1%... 70 million people? Have Indonesian leaders over the last seven decades committed serious crimes against humanity? Of course, some people will point to what happened in East Timor as an atrocity, butWhich country is not horrible?What about so-called civilized, developed countries? What about recent history when Iraq was invaded and almost destroyed based on a deliberate lie by intelligence agencies... leading to the death of 100s of thousands, if not over a million of innocent Iraqi men, women and children.What about slavery of millions of Africans... who was responsible? How about the current trafficking of millions of women and children, one of the worst crimes being perpetrated in the 21st century. Which countries are the primary recipients of trafficked victims, and which countries are the victims of trafficking? Some may not agree with me, but many countries in Asia and Africa are victims of organized international crime syndicates which trade in drugs, women and children. Has Indonesia done horrible things... of course, butAre Indonesians guilty?Here is what Indonesia is really guilty of, in fact what Indonesian people are guilty of... please hear me out.One of the biggest reasons why people may perceive Indonesia as a horrible country is because they simply do not know about us. Ignorance creates fear and misunderstanding. What we don‚Äôt know and what we are simply programmed to believe, we are naturally afraid of. Most people overseas have heard about Bali, and see the island as a place to relax and have a great time. Many people overseas have no idea of Indonesia as a country, don‚Äôt even know where it is, or the name of it‚Äôs capital city. Many people may know that Indonesia has the largest Muslim population on earth, and some people view Islam as a religion which promotes terrorism... nothing is further from the truth. For centuries, Christian extremists have promoted wars, such as over a hundred years of conflict in Northern Ireland between the Protestants and the IRA (Catholics), the KKK white supremacists (US), and numerous other examples.What can Indonesians do?Maybe we should argue that Indonesian people are guilty in not believing enough in their own country, and not sharing their cultures, lifestyles, and yes... religions, with the global community. Do we have problems with social inequality, religious tensions, pollution, etc.? Of course we have those problems, but look at the current unrest and ongoing serious problems in the western world. Now is the opportunity for Indonesians to sell or market our country to the wider world, and explain to the global community about our beautiful land, and explain why we have our own unique problems (common to a young democracy).Indonesians, do you want to keep your country?Regardless of our problems... which is better. To live in a globalized world in which there is a one world currency, one world religion, one world language, one world culture, no borders, a controlling non-voted elite, a globalized AI system, etc. Or alternatively, in a world where unique cultures, currencies, religions, values, etc., are part of everyday life. Do you want to belong to a country, have your own culture, currency and beliefs, or do you want to be a nameless human being under an unelected globalized control system? Maybe, that‚Äôs what Brexit, Trump, Yellow vests, and numerous other global issues are all about.Indonesians, do you want to make yourself heard?It‚Äôs about time our country began to punch above it‚Äôs weight. It‚Äôs about time Indonesians make their voices heard. If English is the universal language used in internationally-based business, politics and social media, then more Indonesians need to learn English and be able to speak and write fluently so that they can share their views and knowledge with the wider world. No more excuses. You can access English movies on local TV, read newspapers and books, surf the internet, or communicate with people who speak and write fluently in English. We have the internet... use it.Check out how a 16-year old kampung kid with zero English became fluent and within 2 years earned over 30 million Rupiah a month using English.You may not agree with everything written here. We are all blessed by our Creator with the ability to think for ourselves and come to our own opinions... diversity of opinions is what makes us rich and unique. So regardless if you agree with me or not,Indonesians, how much do you love your country?Maybe, it‚Äôs our fault if the global community do not know about our beautiful country, or if some people thing our country is horrible. So why not...Share with the world about your country.Share with the world about your own faith.Share with the world about your own culture.Share with the world about your own values.Share with the world about what it‚Äôs like to be an Indonesian.If you don‚Äôt, who will?If you have a voice, make yourselves heard... it‚Äôs the right thing to do, it‚Äôs the only way to be.Let‚Äôs unlock the front door to our incredible home, and invite the world in.I‚Äôve made my voice heard... I‚Äôm not going to stop because I love this country so much.What about you?If you love your home, then fight for it, take care of it, love it... our children trust us to do the right thing.Over to you, it‚Äôs your turn, I really want to know what you think...rod_pallister@yahoo.co.ukBTW‚Ä¶ I have been teaching English fluency, and also helping PhD and Masters students globally for around 20 years so if you need a helping hand just contact me.",8 followers,Keith Miller,1.1K,435,613.8K,https://www.quora.com/Which-is-better-a-BBA-or-a-BCA-in-your-college

5,"Wrell, you did say ‚Äúsome people‚Äù not ALL, so let‚Äôs start there. Not everyone sees Indonesia as a horrible country. Probably not even most, just some.

Surely Indonesia‚Äôs neighbors know it better than those on the other side of the globe from it.Lastly, let me tell you about one country that may have some of the people you refer to in the question, the USA. While I don‚Äôt currently live there it is where I am from, and let me tell you that most American‚Äôs (not just some, but most) have a really terrible grasp of geography and an even poorer understanding of culture‚Äôs other than their own. I used to host exchange students from around the globe, and a common question posed to them by their peers was if they had TV where they came from? Really? A fellow 21st-century teen was able to board a jet plane and fly halfway around the world to greet them smartphone in hand, and still some Americans had doubts about whether or not they‚Äôve seen TV before. Given that level of ignorance of other countries and cultures, do you think that such a person is going to have anything close to a proper idea about what Indonesia is like? They probably couldn‚Äôt even find Indonesia on a map if you had it highlighted in red. No joke, a few years ago a test was given to graduating seniors from Texas high schools. One of the questions on the test asked them to name the land south of the Texas border. Over half of those students failed. Again, do you think such a person is going to have a good understanding of Indonesia? No. What little they do know doesn‚Äôt come from reputable sources anyway, but from television, movies, and old comic books. So, when they do think about it, they are likely to think incorrectly as right. They just know its different from where they grew up and they love where they grew up, so they think that Indonesia must be less. Given all of that, it‚Äôs surprising that only ‚Äúsome people‚Äù in America think Indonesia is a horrible country. It‚Äôs probably because so few people there even both to think about it at all.","2,381 followers",Jonathan Sadikin,1.2K,251,1M,https://www.quora.com/Indonesia-is-a-great-country-but-why-do-some-people-from-other-countries-see-Indonesia-as-a-horrible-country

Children in the USA face much less of this, and are generally good at various other things they pursue, like games, hobbies, art, music, etc.In high school, the pressure increases slightly on students in the USA, but Indian students are at fever pitch preparing for what they believe are the gateways to their future - exams, exams and more exams.Kids in the USA ""graduate"" from school, and get diplomas, and are celebrated for this minor achievement like they got an Olympic medal.  Indian kids are herded through to college, through much pressure and tension for their parents.Once in college, Indian kids go into either the high pressure ""professional"" courses like medicine or engineering, and find some respect, or attend something considered ordinary like arts, science or commerce.  Very slowly, this is changing, because there are many unemployed engineers, perhaps!College is serious work in the USA.  There is a lot of structural freedom, but GPA is very important, and colleges have very high quality of education at the university level.  They take pride in attracting the best students and teachers, and constantly strive to keep syllabus updates to real world requirements.  Most college graduates are eminently employable, unlike their counterparts in India, exceptions like the IITs apart.At the Masters and Ph.D. level, it takes a great deal of effort in the USA, but life is relatively easier in India.  If someone holds a masters degree from a university in the USA, it really means that person knows something in that subject.  In India, this is debatable.  A lot of Ph.D.s coming out of India are also dubious.What is common to both countries:Both produce a huge number of bozos to keep many illusions of democracy, freedom, enterprise, opportunity, dreams, development, growth and a whole lot of crap going without any question.Both supply the middle class with new slaves, who will never really vote in large numbers, rise to make a difference, or have the balls to challenge status quo in any society.Both will however, hold candles and put on ""we care"" shows whenever fashionable.Both provide the stable base for the consumer goods industry.","68,594 followers",Kanthaswamy Balasubramaniam,2K,17.3K,411.3M,https://www.quora.com/Indonesia-is-a-great-country-but-why-do-some-people-from-other-countries-see-Indonesia-as-a-horrible-country

You have to be an engineering/medical degree holder before pursuing what you really want. That is some sheer wastage of human resource, isn‚Äôt it? Likewise neither all streams are equal. It makes no sense that to take science( PCM/B) after 10th class, you have to score above 80+ while if youscore less than 55%, Arts remains the only door open for you. It only shows the herd mentality/prejudice that persists in society about subjects and professions.2) Everything is about rote memorization, leading to behaviour which encourages cramming and forgetting rather than life long learning.3) Standardized testing determines everything, and aptitude of students is not recognized outside this formatBihar topper thinks Political Science is Prodigal Science and related to cooking:She claimed to be Bihar State exam topper, but she cant even pronounce ‚ÄòPolitical Science‚Äô in a press interview4) Lack of diversity in the subjects you can take in college (e.g. can't double major in Math and German like you can in the USA)5) Extreme pressure from parents / society to use education for financial security = CSE degrees for programming jobs or medicine. Societal pressure to get into the ""right schools"", not only for the education aspect but to ensure good job/ marriage prospects, in general success in life. Little incentive to take risks and follow own interests or encourage creativity. Generally conformist culture, which makes educational achievement the only thing that matters to social standing.6) Additional extreme pressure due to limited seats resulting in very intense competition between students.7) Reservation system8) Management quota system9) Government control of education/ Government Monopoly in education.10) Right to Education Act.11) Education sector is closed to for-profit organizations.12) Few opportunities and flexibility to cross over into different streams of educationSolutionRote learningYes, we do know that many IB schools across India are trying to bring in interactive education and we laud that immensely. But the evil of rote learning is yet to be wiped out from a majority of Indian schools. Owing to the fixated style of question papers that have been doing the rounds in board exams from time immemorial, rote learning has continued.We‚Äôre very sure that most students won‚Äôt be clear about many of the basic foundation concepts taught in school even after they‚Äôve graduated.Make the Teachers feel worthy, pay them more:The academic curriculum board, in most cases is filled with people above their 60‚Äôs and 70‚Äôs. With all due respect to them, I strongly feel that you need a bunch of younger professors in there to have that mix of experience and youth in the system. The younger ones would be more in sync, more in line with the technological changes and the new age needs of the students in their years to come. The fact, however, is that most of the younger professors are either outcasts (from the IT factory) or are doing this job because they don‚Äôt have better things to do. Very few among the young are actually in teaching for the sake of teaching. The point is very simple; they are paid pittens in comparison with the rest. A graduating student earns more in an IT company than what a Lecturer or even a Assistant Professor earns in some colleges (despite the 6th Pay commission increase which covers only on the Government colleges). Once you start paying more, you get quality faculty in, you get people who actually want to teach and people who are worth the caliber of teaching. After this, you will have a scenario where you have quality young people who can actually give the 60‚Äôs and 70‚Äôs in the curriculum boards a run for their money and there wouldn‚Äôt be any excuses. So where would the money come in from?Industry Interaction a Placement Obligation:One of the key pillars in growth in education is the level of industry interaction with the students. Companies should be sought out for such interactions, if they don‚Äôt agree to it, then the universities should use their advantage. When companies come for placements, there should be a basic qualification criteria for their eligibility for the placements. For example, they should have contributed investment worth 2 to 4 lakhs (just example, this can vary up or down) in R and D with the university to be eligible to come to placement. Most of the companies would fall in line automatically since for them human capital is much more important than these meager sums of money. You think any IT company would care about a few lakhs when they are recruiting 600 to 1000 people? When you provide so much human(s) capital you think they would ignore it? Not a chance, this would make the university utilize its human potential to the hilt and also enhance its industry interaction numbers significantly. Eventually, this investment would enhance the learning experience of the student and make him want to give back to the institutes more once that person graduatesUse the power of the Alumni:One of the most underrated potentials in Indian education system is the power of the Alumni. Barring the IIT‚Äôs and few other top institutes, the concept of Alumni networking is nonexistent. In an era where every Indian graduating is earning somewhere, alumni networks need to be very well intertwined with the university affairs. Alumni are very eager to give; just that a) they don‚Äôt know who to give b) they are worried about where the money would go. Once you establish a credible network which is transparent, it would give the avenue as well as the confidence for the alumni to contribute in terms of money or academic expertiseAll of the above are just mere suggestions to tackle system that has numerous issues. These suggestions might not break the deadlock or create a revolution by any means but it can be something that can be incorporated. These suggestions might not be relevant to some. These suggestions might also sound farfetched but if it at least one of them adds value somewhere to the education system, then it‚Äôs worth itMarking SystemAll the other evils of the Indian education system ultimately come down to the method in which students are marked.Is it justified that a student is evaluated only on the basis of his/her performance for the duration of three hours of the exam? If the axis of grading and marking is shifted to classroom participation, project work, communication and leadership skills and extracurricular performance, only then will a genuine student shine out.This might sound like a utopian proposition but the Indian education system badly needs to bring about this change.Respect for all streams‚ÄúOh has she done a MA in English? She‚Äôll end up becoming a teacher‚Äù‚ÄúWhat good is a diploma in hospitality management? It ultimately means doing a job in a hotel as a cook right?‚ÄùIf you‚Äôve heard these lines time and again from you elders, don‚Äôt you think it‚Äôs time you stop them?How long are we going to look down upon vocational streams and look up to medicine, engineering, IIM and I IT Students at the school level need to be educated through career counseling regarding the kind of streams that exist and what importance each of them plays to make an economy diverse.Variety in education streamsWhy do we always see students being envious of their counterparts in the USA?It‚Äôs because there are just three options that student have after Class 10 ‚Äì they‚Äôre stuck with Science, Arts or Commerce. If they‚Äôre not good enough for either of these, they jet set straight into diplomas and certificate courses. Don‚Äôt you think the Indian education system needs to introduce combination courses in which students can opt for a major and a minor subject? If students in America can pursue Physiotherapy with Art History and Biological Science with Photography,Make the Private Institutes for profit, not non-profit:This might sound like a ludicrous suggestion but if you think about it, it might make some sense. We all know that private colleges make money and they are run as large businesses. The solution, I feel, lies in making them take away the non profit status and make them competitive. Make them under direct competition with each other so that they can get fight it out openly rather that doing so under the carpet. We cant follow the English education system and yet sit in our holy grail of non profit, can we? Education is a business in some form, the more we hide behind it, and the more corruption would step in. If Educational institutes are using this business to improve their system, then let them do it, that‚Äôs how world class universities abroad work and that‚Äôs how we should work if we follow the colonial system. The best way forward is to make them ‚Äúfor‚Äù profit, taxable and it would increase capital for them as well as increase transparency for us.The system of tuition classesCommenting on this subject is like plunging one‚Äôs hand into a vicious cycle which seems to have no beginning or end. Reasons for tuition classes mushrooming are because students say that the teaching in schools is lax and not good enough for them to clear exams. Whereas teachers say that students jump ahead many chapters in the tuition classes before they are even taught in school.Although the picture does seem dismal, there is hope because some of these changes are slowly being made by select education providers. But how quickly will these changes percolate down to common man in India, only time will tell.Class 10thThe main focus should be that, when a student reaches class 10th, he has enough knowledge of all the fields to figure out the subjects he needs to take in class 11th and the classes/clubs he needs to join in case he is in fields like sports/singing/dancing/painting etc. For this, a large part of our existing system should remain same, with some major changes in its execution.Higher Education changesI would just like to give some statistics.I would like to take back current reservation system on caste basis and gender basis and would give the reservation to people who are BPL ( below poverty line) and who are not capable of getting education. I would give free education to those in need and who are helpless.Due to this reservation India is still developing and will always remain in developing countries. With reservation India can't be developed country.I would force student to know about India instead of knowing about Britishers. What I mean to say is I will change history books.Education has been a problem in our country and lack of it has been blamed for all sorts of evil for hundreds of years. Even Rabindranath Tagore wrote lengthy articles about how Indian education system needs to change. Funny thing is that from the colonial times, few things have changed. We have established IITs, IIMs, law schools and other institutions of excellence; students now routinely score 90% marks so that even students with 90+ percentage find it difficult to get into the colleges of their choice; but we do more of the same old stuff.Rote learning still plagues our system, students study only to score marks in exams, and sometimes to crack exams like IIT JEE, AIIMS or CLAT. The colonial masters introduced education systems in India to create clerks and civil servants, and we have not deviated much from that pattern till today. If once the youngsters prepared en masse for civil services and bank officers exams, they now prepare to become engineers. If there are a few centres of educational excellence, for each of those there are thousands of mediocre and terrible schools, colleges and now even universities that do not meet even minimum standards. If things have changed a little bit somewhere, elsewhere things have sunk into further inertia, corruption and lack of ambition.Creating a few more schools or allowing hundreds of colleges and private universities to mushroom is not going to solve the crisis of education in India. And a crisis it is ‚Äì we are in a country where people are spending their parent‚Äôs life savings and borrowed money on education ‚Äì and even then not getting standard education, and struggling to find employment of their choice. In this country, millions of students are victim of an unrealistic, pointless, mindless rat race. The mind numbing competition and rote learning do not only crush the creativity and originality of millions of Indian students every year, it also drives brilliant students to commit suicide.We also live in a country where the people see education as the means of climbing the social and economic ladder. If the education system is failing ‚Äì then it is certainly not due to lack of demand for good education, or because a market for education does not exist.Education system in India is failing because of more intrinsic reasons. There are systemic faults that do not let our demand for good education translate into a great marketplace with excellent education services.Focus on skill based educationOur education system is geared towards teaching and testing knowledge at every level as opposed to teaching skills. ‚ÄúGive a man a fish and you feed him one day, teach him how to catch fishes and you feed him for a lifetime.‚Äù I believe that if you teach a man a skill, you enable him for a lifetime. Knowledge is largely forgotten after the semester exam is over. Still, year after year Indian students focus on cramming information. The best crammers are rewarded by the system. This is one of the fundamental flaws of our education system.Reward creativity, original thinking, research and innovationOur education system rarely rewards what deserves highest academic accolades. Deviance is discouraged. Risk taking is mocked. Our testing and marking systems need to be built to recognize original contributions, in form of creativity, problem solving, valuable original research and innovation. If we could do this successfully Indian education system would have changed overnight.Memorising is no learning; the biggest flaw in our education system is perhaps that it incentivizes memorizing above originality.Get smarter people to teachFor way too long teaching became the sanctuary of the incompetent. Teaching jobs are until today widely regarded as safe, well-paying, risk-free and low-pressure jobs. Once a teacher told me in high school ‚ÄúWell, if you guys don‚Äôt study it is entirely your loss ‚Äì I will get my salary at the end of the month anyway.‚Äù He could not put across the lack of incentive for being good at teaching any better. Thousands of terrible teachers all over India are wasting valuable time of young children every day all over India.Education for allIt is high time to encourage a breed of superstar teachers. The internet has created this possibility ‚Äì the performance of a teacher now need not be restricted to a small classroom. Now the performance of a teacher can be opened up for the world to see. The better teacher will be more popular, and acquire more students. That‚Äôs the way of the future.We need leaders, entrepreneurs in teaching positions, not salaried people trying to hold on to their mantle.Implement massive technology infrastructure for educationIndia needs to embrace internet and technology if it has to teach all of its huge population, the majority of which is located in remote villages. Now that we have computers and internet, it makes sense to invest in technological infrastructure that will make access to knowledge easier than ever. Instead of focussing on outdated models of brick and mortar colleges and universities, we need to create educational delivery mechanisms that can actually take the wealth of human knowledge to the masses. The tools for this dissemination will be cheap smartphones, tablets and computers with high speed internet connection. While all these are becoming more possible than ever before, there is lot of innovation yet to take place in this space.Re-define the purpose of the education systemOur education system is still a colonial education system geared towards generating babus and pen-pushers under the newly acquired skin of modernity. We may have the most number of engineering graduates in the world, but that certainly has not translated into much technological innovation here. Rather, we are busy running the call centres of the rest of the world ‚Äì that is where our engineering skills end.The goal of our new education system should be to create entrepreneurs, innovators, artists, scientists, thinkers and writers who can establish the foundation of a knowledge based economy rather than the low-quality service provider nation that we are turning into.Effective deregulationUntil today, an institute of higher education in India must be operating on a not-for profit basis. This is discouraging for entrepreneurs and innovators who could have worked in these spaces. On the other hand, many people are using education institutions to hide their black money, and often earning a hefty income from education business through clever structuring and therefore bypassing the rule with respect to not earning profit from recognized educational institutions. As a matter of fact, private equity companies have been investing in some education service provider companies which in turn provide services to not-for-profit educational institutions and earn enviable profits. Sometimes these institutes are so costly that they are outside the rich of most Indian students.There is an urgent need for effective de-regulation of Indian education sector so that there is infusion of sufficient capital and those who provide or create extraordinary educational products or services are adequately rewarded.Take mediocrity out of the systemOur education system today encourages mediocrity ‚Äì in students, in teachers, throughout the system. It is easy to survive as a mediocre student, or a mediocre teacher in an educational institution. No one shuts down a mediocre college or mediocre school. Hard work is always tough, the path to excellence is fraught with difficulties. Mediocrity is comfortable. Our education system will remain sub-par or mediocre until we make it clear that it is not ok to be mediocre. If we want excellence, mediocrity cannot be tolerated. Mediocrity has to be discarded as an option. Life of those who are mediocre must be made difficult so that excellencePersonalize education ‚Äì one size does not fit allAssembly line education prepares assembly line workers. However, the drift of economic world is away from assembly line production. Indian education system is built on the presumption that if something is good for one kid, it is good for all kids.Some kids learn faster, some are comparatively slow. Some people are visual learners, others are auditory learners, and still some others learn faster from experience. If one massive monolithic education system has to provide education to everyone, then there is no option but to assume that one size fits all. If however, we can effectively decentralize education, and if the government did not obsessively control what would be the ‚Äúsyllabus‚Äù andwhat will be the method of instruction, there could be an explosion of new and innovative courses geared towards serving various niches of learners,Take for example, the market for learning dancing. There are very different dance forms that attract students with different tastes. More importantly, different teachers and institutes have developed different ways of teaching dancing. This could never happen if there was a central board of dancing education which enforced strict standards of what will be taught and how such things are to be taught.Central regulation kills choice, and stifles innovation too. As far as education is concerned, availability of choices, de-regulation, profitability, entrepreneurship and emergence of niche courses are all inter-connected.Allow private capital in educationThe government cannot afford to provide higher education to all the people in the country. It is too costly for the government to do so. The central government spends about 4% of budget expenditure on education, compared to 40% on defence. Historically, the government just did not have enough money to spend on even opening new schools and universities, forget overhauling the entire system and investing in technology and innovation related to the education system. Still, until today, at least on paper only non-profit organizations are allowed to run educational institutions apart from government institutions. Naturally, the good money, coming from honest investors who want to earn from honest but high impact businesses do not get into education sector. Rather, there are crooks, money launderers and politicians opening ‚Äúprivate‚Äù educational institutions which extract money from the educational institution through creative structuring. The focus is on marketing rather than innovation or providing great educational service ‚Äì one of the major examples of this being IIPM.Allowing profit making will encourage serious entrepreneurs, innovators and investors to take interest in the education sector. The government does not have enough money to provide higher education of reasonable quality to all of us, and it has no excuse to prevent private capital from coming into the educational sector.Make reservation irrelevantWe have reservation in education today because education is not available universally. Education has to be rationed. This is not a long ‚Äìterm solution. If we want to emerge as a country build on a knowledge economy, driven by highly educated people ‚Äì we need to make good education so universally available that reservation will lose its meaning",18 followers,Asim Qureshi,2.2K,996,155.5M,https://www.quora.com/Indonesia-is-a-great-country-but-why-do-some-people-from-other-countries-see-Indonesia-as-a-horrible-country

While in India you just have to get good ranks in entrance tests.3. Education in India is not as creative as in US. e.g. in US, you are required to not just study books but implement them as well - by rigging some circuits, or building machines, robots. You have to do presentations often(almost every week, sometimes 4-5 presentations in a day). You appear for mock tests, quizzes that are mandatory and carry marks for final grading.4. In India, you can copy in assignments, exams. In US, you can but then if you get caught, you can get 0 in that subject or on subsequent time - you can be out of university or country.5. In US, there is more emphasis on overall learning through classes, assignments, projects, presentations, group discussions. In India, more emphasis is on classes & books and somehow getting good marks.6.  In US, you get to choose your subjects to study in a course. In India, you get fixed no of subjects from university.7. In US, you can work off campus for longer periods that in India during your course work. There you get CPT and OPT during degree courses. CPT is for 11 months while OPT is ~2 years. So, you get at least 3 years of industry work experience while you are studying.8. In US, there is no reservation based on caste, creed, religion unlike in India. So, everyone gets a fair and transparent chance to compete with each other for resources - be it may for scholarships or for on campus jobs. Merit rules there!9.

31,"To start with, both countries have invested a lot of money in the education field and both have managed to develop world-class leaders and legendary personalities. If we analyse the two systems, we'll find some similarities and some differences.1. When talking about the differences, one of the first things that come to mind is flexibility.

America's education system is designed in a way that the high school students don't have any difficulty in passing the examinations. On the other hand, India's education system is high and rigid. The curriculum is comparatively difficult, and designed to prepare students for challenges later in life. To highlight this difference, it can be noted that in India, Mathematics is compulsory till the 10th standard while in the US, mathematics is an optional course.2. It has been reported by many studies that the Indian education system offers comparatively fewer options to the students as compared to the American education system. This is a challenge that needs serious addressing. It has produced students with strong analytical skills, yes, but in terms of the study of languages, the Indian system lags a little behind the western. It can be easily observed that subjects like history and geography are sidelined in India and are morally looked down upon too.3.
