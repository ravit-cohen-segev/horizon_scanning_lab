3,"I am going to answer this in a way that at least most of the audience can agree with. There are three critical flaws Disney made.When Disney bought Lucasfilms, they declared all the Star Wars books non-canon and cancelled the Star Wars cartoon series.That was the first step, because now it became extremely hard to create a new Star Wars movie. People did not like Force Awakens because it was a copy of a New Hope, and while I do see that, I actually liked it.So when Disney tried to create a different film called The Last Jedi, it turned out to be the most polI am going to answer this in a way that at least most of the audience can agree with.

People did not like Force Awakens because it was a copy of a New Hope, and while I do see that, I actually liked it.So when Disney tried to create a different film called The Last Jedi, it turned out to be the most polarizing Star Wars film of all time, even more than Empire Strikes Back.I am going to go off topic, and talk about the MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe). Part of the reason why the MCU did well is that most of the movies were based on source material. I can easily tell that Spider Man Homecoming had materials based on the Ultimate Spider Man comics. Or Thor Ragnarok had elements from Planet Hulk.Another advantage the MCU had was that it not only had the source material, but the directors and actors would research on stories that were bad, and they would make it better.For example, in Civil War comics, the fans didn’t like it because Tony Stark was acting out of character, and he was a mean guy. The Russo Brothers adapted the Civil War storyline for the final Captain America movie, but they changed the argument of the movie to make it easier to understand, and they also made Tony Stark more sympathetic.What I am trying to say, is that Disney could have done something similar to the MCU. Disney could have make a sequel trilogy with the same characters, but use some elements of the Star Wars Legends stories in their trilogy to make it more cohesive. But Disney wanted to wipe the whole Star Wars slate clean, and that was their first flaw.The second mistake Disney made was that they:2. Disrespected Star Wars characters, and introduced boring charactersIn an interview with George Lucas, Kathleen Kennedy stated that the whole objective of the sequel trilogy was to “preserve and protect the characters.”I can understand Han Solo having to die, and the tragic death of Carrie Fisher. But I can’t ignore Luke Skywalker, and how he had his character ruined (his death was fine).People can argue whether or not Luke Skywalker was out of character when he tried to kill Kylo Ren in his sleep, but the fact still stands that Luke Skywalker was divisive among fans. No one can argue with that.Out of all the characters, Kylo Ren was the most interesting and memorable one.He was a force to be reckoned with, and in Rise of Skywalker he was threatening. But he was overshadowed by a bigger enemy, which is a prevalent problem in the sequel trilogy.Finn had the biggest potential wasted, Rey and Poe were bickering. Captain Phasma, Snoke and General Hux were disposable. Out of all the characters, even Rose Tico was wasted.No one is going to remember the characters except Kylo Ren. The only characters worth remembering are the characters that were ruined or wasted.Finally, the third reason how Disney ruined Star Wars:3. They did not have a clear outline/plan for the trilogyWe can talk trash about the prequels all we want. The prequels had clunky dialogue, the characters felt hollow, the pacing was horrendous, the plot was uninteresting.But at least it had a clear objective/goal. At least the prequels were consistent. In fact, as time went on the prequels got a bit better.The sequel trilogy had no goal whatsoever. I think The Last Jedi was the movie that ruined Star Wars forever. People may bag on the Force Awakens for being too similar to A New Hope, but at least it was still enjoyable and cool.The Last Jedi completely went in the opposite direction, and had plans that were different from The Force Awakens. The decisions the Last Jedi made were not how JJ Abrams envisioned, and that led to the downfall of the sequel trilogy.The worst part was that the Star Wars sequel trilogy got consistently worse for me.No one can change my mind that the Star Wars sequel trilogy had a clear, consistent vision.In conclusion, the three main reasons Disney ruined Star Wars were: declaring the Star Wars expanded universe “Non-Canon”, disrespecting characters and not creating memorable characters, except Kylo Ren, and not having a plan.",3 followers,Arthur Huan,584,1K,30.4M,https://www.quora.com/How-do-spaceships-explode-in-fire-in-Star-Wars-with-no-oxygen

6,"OK, I’m going to try for fun to retcon what you see on the screen into some kind of physics that’s consistent with the technology of Star Wars and modern physics.The Definition Of Explosion | Chemical & Engineering Newshttps://cOK, I’m going to try for fun to retcon what you see on the screen into some kind of physics that’s consistent with the technology of Star Wars and modern physics.The Definition Of Explosion | Chemical & Engineering Newshttps://cen.acs.org/articles/91/i36/Definition-Explosion.htmlThe word that’s not included in that definition is Combustion.Here are some explosions that occur without combustion:By Soviet Authorities, Fair use,Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event - WikipediaThe old 50’s classic:OK, so all of these have fire balls that resulted from combustion of fuel, the air or what have you but this is the important insight, the cumbustion is a secondary effect of the heat of the explosion source. Why we think of combustion as so important has to do with it’s ability to create a heatsource that causes a rapidly expanding pressure wave. But it’s not neccesary in all cases.Even in cases where you need fuel to generate an explosion doesn’t mean you need air.Hypergolic fuels such as dinitrogen tetroxide and Hyrazine which were used in a lot of older ICBM’s provide the oxygen needed for combustion on their own without requiring air.So what you need for an explosion is a pressure wave moving faster than the speed of sound in an uncontrolled direction, which means you need a medium for the wave to propagate through otherwise it’s just shrapnel and frags.So early in the battle, right after Lando suggested moving the fleet into engage the star destroyers, you see a number of attacks, including an X-wing pilot screaming, “she’s going to blow!” while one of the geodesic shield generators on the STar Destroyers brige structure demolishes itself from an internal explosion taking out it’s shields. Later the B-wings of Blade Squadron come in and take out the controls systems for the hyperdrive reactor, which is essentially how you destroy an X-wing, either super-heat the reaction so that it destroys it’s containment vessel and expands outward or you destroy the ability of the system to control itself and let it tear apart, similar to what happens in a refinery explosion.What might be different is the Death STar reactor in return of the Jedi which is exposed to space with no atmosphere around it, just a hawking node or something produced between the poles of the reactor to produce energy by crushing matter in a gravity well-who knowsSo this is another case of destabilizing the reaction in the hyper matter chamber (above) which is why Wedge attacks the power regulator on the North Tower and Lando shoots concussion missiles at the emitter node, which causes a small explosion from the nexus of the reaction. Now the reactor collapses and goes critical, vaporizing it’s core and fires break out and secondary explosions are going off, but you’ll notice the deathstar is still in tact when the Falcon bursts from the flames-and then you see that sudden flash and then the detonation as if a much larger event than the explosion of the hypermatter reaction had happened. Here’s a notion, the crushed space created by the hawking node itself expanded and what destroyed the Death Star was a massive gravity wave similar to what we detected with the LIGO array in 2015, which was the result of two black holes colliding 1.3 billion light years away. Talk about unforgettable.So in summary, it’s realistic that with pressurized Spacecraft, you’d see combustion of either fuel or of the atmosphere in the ships itself, but despite the massive damage and loss of life the fire would cause on it’s own, the principle destructive force comes from the power systems that the ships use to propel themselves.-just me thinking out loud.","1,797 followers",Doyen Rainey,705,1.3K,9.5M,https://www.quora.com/How-do-spaceships-explode-in-fire-in-Star-Wars-with-no-oxygen

Nuclear fusion is based on the following chemical reaction mechanism;3 tritium 1 + 2 deuterium 1 react to 4 helium 2 + emitted neutronThe below explanation of the hydrogen particle the deuterium particle and the tritium particle are on my Quora site along with explanations of the nuclear structure and isotope explanations including containment of particles in nuclear orbitals. 3 tritium 1 is a hydrogen particle with a hydrogen particle and a negatron in orbit of the hydrogen particle nucleus and 2 deuterium 1 is a hydrogen particle with a hydrogen particle in the orbitals of the hydrogen particle with 4 helium 2 being a hydrogen particle with two hydrogen particles and a negatron in the orbitals with the neutron being emitted as a hydrogen particle. The hydrogen particle is observed as a neutron as the hydrogen particle is neutral as the nuclear charge is balanced by the minute weighted electromagnetic energy particulates surrounding the nucleus of hydrogen particle. This creates a huge chain reaction under intense heat and pressure.Deuterium Is A Hydrogen Particle With A Hydrogen Particle In The Orbitals And Tritium Is A Hydrogen Particle With A Hydrogen Particle And A Negatron In The OrbitalsDeuterium is a hydrogen particle as described below with a positively charged particulate in the orbitals. The hydrogen bond formed in D2O is stronger than H2O as deuterium is a larger particle and attracts the minute weighted electromagnetic energy particulates more strongly than the hydrogen particle due to the positive charge of the additional hydrogen particle in the orbitals. Tritium is a hydrogen particle with two particles in the orbitals a hydrogen particle and a negatron as the negatively charged equivalent of a hydrogen particle in the same orbital for balance.Hydrogen Is A ParticleA proton cannot exist singularly as there must be stability in combining with at least one neutron and with neutrons and protons. Helium is therefore the lightest element as a proton and neutron combined with an electromagnetic energy field for charge balance. Hydrogen Is a particle with an electromagnetic field surrounding the particle for charge balance and is in quadrants positively charged less negatively charged positively charged and less negatively charged and an antimatter high density metallic core to spin the particle around the vertical axis and bind the quadrants. This is why hydrogen gives up the electromagnetic energy field more easily than expected and therefore forms hydrogen bonding such as in water, which enables life to exist. The charged quadrants of the hydrogen particle provide stability and allow the hydrogen particle to be a free ion with the honeycomb structured particle filling the space inside the field of weighted electromagnetic energy particulates. The structure of subatomic particles such as neutrinos and subneutrinos is made up in the same way with a field of electromagnetic energy particulates with weight surrounding the honeycomb structured particulates with varied charge depending on the charge arrangement of the particles quadrants.

There is no radioactive waste as in atomic fission power.In conclusion it has been reported that China has achieved and sustained a temperature of 100 million degrees which is one of the prerequisite conditions for nuclear fusion to take place. The next step is to simultaneously achieve the great pressures equivalent to the sun’s core.Update April 2019. The latest research findings from Princeton Physics Laboratory in collusion with a Max Planck researcher has even lower the stakes to kick start a fusion reaction in a tokamak. In a conventional doughnut shaped tokamaks the traditional approach was to use solenoids to launch, heat and bottle the hot plasma at the Centre line of the tokamak (to ionize the injection of a gas stream, stripping them of electrons converting the gas into a plasma) so that it could be manipulated by the powerful magnetic fields and kept away from the walls of the reactor vessel. The new research has also found that in a spheroidal tokamak, electrodes could kickstart converting gas at room temperature using specially positioned electrodes to ignite the fusion reaction by converting the gas into plasma by the transient Coaxial Helical injection process dispensing with space consuming solenoids. Scaling up of the rector may be done by the Tokamak Scaling Code that was developed by one of the lead researchers.In conclusion, with the update, the entrance fee into Fusion technology has just been lowered and more progress is expected in the years ahead.Ref:DOE/Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory.

My former father-in-law also worked at Lawrence Berkeley Labs, and was an engineer designing superconducting coil magnets and had decades of experience working with fusion researchers, even though his primary application was particle accelerators. From having many long conversations with these very intelligent and qualified people I realized that there are some really hard problems that block practical fusion, with no immediate solutions in sight.The only place we know of working, large-scale, energy-generating fusion reactions is at the center of a star, where the gravity of the massive star creates the necessary density, temperature, and time being held in that state at the core for fusion reactions to run continuously. This is called the Lawson criteria, and is hard to achieve. All of the layers of the star above that act as an energy exchanger, converting all the gamma rays and fast neutrons at the core into progressively less energetic wavelengths of light and motion of nuclei (heat) so by the time they reach the surface of the star, that energy is emitted as IR and visible light that heats and powers our planet's biosphere, and can provide photovoltaic energy to us as well. All of our efforts in fusion have been to try and reproduce this process on earth, in a small reactor that can provide practical energy.First I will talk aboutThe first problem with magnetic confinement is fundamental - no matter how strong or well formed the magnetic field containing the plasma is, it will always leak, as positive nuclei or ions spiralling around the magnetic field lines collide and scatter, eventually drifting out of the containment field. The only known solution is to make the reactor larger so the scattering ions take longer to travel to the plasma boundary, and thus more fusion can happen during that time. Pretty brute force.The world's most advanced magnetic confinement fusion power plant is ITER, which, to reduce the ion scattering problem mentioned above, is 6-stories tall and about the same dimension in diameter, containing the mass of 3 Eiffel towers, and it is still not expected to be large enough to contain a plasma long enough to sustain burning and produce continuous energy generation.A more practical problem is how do we extract the energy? Most of the energy in deuterium-tritium fusion reactions is released in fast, high-energy neutrons, which (because they are neutral, and have no electric charge) are not confined by the magnetic field, don't heat up the plasma, and have to be stopped by a thick shield, which then heats up, and can vaporize water to steam in order to power turbines and electrical generators. The problem is the constant bombardment by neutrons makes the shield material degrade with time, and become very radioactive, posing a problem for removal and disposal.Also, deuterium-tritium fusion reactions are currently used because they take place at the lowest energies and at the lowest plasma temperatures of all the possible fusion fuels, and thus are easier to ignite and keep lit. However, tritium is not found naturally in any significant quantities and needs to be manufactured in nuclear reactors. With today's production capacity, we just cannot make enough tritium to power even ITER continuously. We could use better fuels, like Helium-3 or Boron-11, which do not emit neutrons and thus 'burn clean', but the plasma temperature must be much higher and the confinement much better to ignite fusion and sustain it with these fuels. And while Boron-11 is plentiful, Helium-3 is so rare that scientists think that the best source of it is lunar regolith that has been irradiated for billions of years on the moon's surface. Any energy generation infrastructure that requires a regular supply of a moon-based fuel, even as energy dense as He3, will probably never work out.A proposed solution to the Tritium deficit is to construct the shield surrounding the reactor with lithium, which is abundant, and fissions into tritium when struck by neutrons, thereby 'breeding' tritium within the reactor itself. Of course, this comes with its own set of problems of how to capture, purify, and contain the tritium after it is released into the tokamak reaction chamber from the walls.Another issue is that when all of the superconducting magnets in ITER are running at full current (160,000 amps) to create the 13 Tesla toroidal magnetic field (13x that in an MRI machine) and to create the other plasma-shaping and heating fields, they are storing 60 GigaJoules, or around 12 Tons of TNT worth of energy. This is because the 180 kilometers of superconducting Niobium-Tin wires in all these massive magnet coils can carry enormous electrical current when supercooled with liquid helium.More info on the ITER magnets:But, if that cooling fails, the superconductor heats up, quenches, and becomes a normal conductor, and can no longer carry that enormous current. With 160,000 amps suddenly meeting resistance, the coil rapidly vaporizes, and causes a meltdown of the other coils, with a total energy release of 12 tons of TNT. This is very undesirable, especially when those coils are wrapped around a highly radioactive shield that also vaporizes and is expelled into the atmosphere. There are fault-detection systems, but it takes a while to dissipate that amount of energy safely, and there may not be enough time to react quickly enough in the event of a catastrophic magnet coil failure.So, some gotchas left to solve for practical fusion energy generation with magnetic confinement, with some perhaps not so easily solved.Inertial confinement fusionIt also has many of the same problems with energy conversion to electricity, and much worse wear and tear on the shielding from these small nuclear fusion explosions being set off, which also trashes all the precision equipment needed to hold the fuel pellet in the focus of the converging laser beams with extreme accuracy. So, a lot of practical damage control problems before inertial confinement fusion is a practical source of energy generation.While these problems may be solved, practical application is still a very long way off, and currently the main application of inertial confinement fusion is as an experimental testbed for calibrating computer codes used to simulate and design thermonuclear fusion weapons. As horrific as these weapons may be, the simulation codes developed for designing them (sorry maintaining them), are the one of the greatest tools for innovation in fusion energy. There is a hydrodynamics code which simulates the behavior of the fissile (and fusion) materials under extreme conditions of pressure and temperature, as well as transport codes that model neutron transport and scattering in the materials under these conditions, and many other bits and bobs. They are all standard numerical techniques, and the really classified part is the integration and calibration of all these codes with previous nuclear weapon tests from the past, and with these small scale simulations in the present.Electrostatic Confinement FusionBasically you need a vacuum container the size of a basketball and a pump to empty it. You put a small spherical wire cage the size of a golf ball in the center, and a larger wire cage the size of a bowling ball around it. You then pump out all the air, and apply a very large (10,000V) electrical potential between the two cages, with the small negative cathode at the center, and the positive anode at the periphery.Then you open a valve and let in a very small amount of Deuterium gas (commercially available) into the vacuum chamber, and it ionizes in the large voltage potential, the D+ ions in the periphery experience a very strong electric field (100K V/m), and are rapidly accelerated towards the center of the reactor, with enough energy to collide and fuse the deuterium nuclei (no tritium required). This fusion can be measured with an external neutron counter.Theoretically, power generation would be simple, as the fusion products consisting of highly energetic He3 and (few) H3 ions could be decelerated in an electric field and the current from that used to generate electricity directly.Here is ECG Herman’s excellent thesis paper on designing and constructing a Farnsworth Fusor:Although they seem like a obvious winners due to their simplicity and effectiveness, ECF reactors have several things limiting scaling:a) There is a limit to the deuterium gas density before performance degrades, so generation capacity is limited.b) Deuterium ions tend to collide with the wire cage cathode in the center, which absorbs them, heating the cage, and causing energy loss and contamination from metal atoms being dislodged.c) As the deuterium ions oscillate back and forth through the center, each time they change direction, they emit bremsstrahlung radiation, or photons of light, losing energy (this is how your dentist’s x-ray machine works).d) Scattering tends to reduce the nice, radial trajectories of the ions into a Maxwellian distribution over time, reducing the fusion that occurs.There has been work in using electromagnets at the periphery to try and hold a ball of electrons in the center, eliminating the need for a central cage… akaThermonuclear WeaponsIn the Teller-Ulam, two-stage, thermonuclear weapon, a spherical plutonium fission primary (with deuterium-tritium fusion fuel at the core to boost it) is imploded by conventional explosives, the plutonium is crushed far beyond critical density, fissions and detonates. The initial radiation released is contained and focused onto the fusion secondary to implode it, ignite fusion, and detonate it. I just mention this to illustrate the enormous energy needed to really reach the Lawson criteria in a large scale, but nuclear weapons kind of freak me out, so I'm going to refer you to the link to the Wikipedia article about them if you want to read more:Thermonuclear weapon - WikipediaSo, in summary, we should not shut down or stop building today's fission nuclear reactors, as commercial fusion reactors are not only far in the future, but also produce radioactive waste (their shielding, which needs to be periodically replaced), and Tokamaks can melt down catastrophically and explode if there is a cooling failure in the magnet coils during full power operation. They also do not run on seawater, like some say. We need expensive and difficult to produce tritium (which is also radioactive) to ignite fusion at the temperatures and densities that today's tokamak magnetic fields can produce.To advance fusion energy in your career, I think the best fields to study would be physics (classical, electrodynamics, plasma, quantum, nuclear…) and computer science, with a focus on numerical simulation. The actual physical fusion reactors are so expensive and time-consuming to build, test, and operate, that you may only get to iterate designs once or twice in a career, but computer simulations can take us in so many different directions more cheaply and easily by comparison.Perhaps there is some exotic stellarator magnetic confinement design, or advanced Farnsworth electrostatic confinement design that has not been explored in depth, that will turn out to hold the key to fusion energy. Simulation is probably the best first step to find it, unless you have a few billion dollars and several hundred kilometers of Niobium-Tin wire and helium cooling tubing to play with.Brent","1,092 followers",Liu Lisong,2K,643,2.9M,https://www.quora.com/How-do-spaceships-explode-in-fire-in-Star-Wars-with-no-oxygen

In theory once you have that, you have your essentially limitless energy source. It’s not actually limitless, but there is enough water in the Solar system to maintain our level of civilization on nothing but fusion power for billions (yes, with a B) of years, well beyond when the Sun runs out of hydrogen.On the other hand all of these projects are very far from being useful. See, producing more energy in plasma than what you put in via magnets is an important milestone, but the one you should be looking at is not the energy of plasma, it’s the energy you can harvest from that plasma. It’s mostly thermal energy and the conversion factor of that to electric power is usually around 1/2. So even these reactors won’t actually be producing more electric power than what they need to power them. They’d have to produce approximately twice that much just to break even.But wait, breaking even still only means you’re running the reactor without external input. You aren’t putting any energy in the grid yet at this point, all you’re doing is producing small quantities of helium. For the reactor to become commercially viable, it needs to produce energy far in excess of that and you need to account for energy needed to generate adequate deuterium and possibly tritium to run the core.That’s why even the furthest advanced fusion reactors are still very far removed from being useful as a power source. It is hoped that once we manage to produce a reactor that will put more energy out than it needed to run it, smaller incremental improvements will follow quickly and the next two steps will not need an exorbiant amount of time. Math seems to suggest we’ll be able to extract several times the energy we put in, that’s why these projects are being financed in the first place.But don’t count on fusion power plant construction starting in mid-2030s either.

Let me tell you how it works with personal experience.A few months ago, I traveled to southern Sichuan for a short trip. I drove into the mountains of the Yungui Plateau.There is a village built on a cliff. Known as the cliff village. Twenty years ago, the villagers had to walk on a mountain path that was nearly 90 degrees in order to gain contact with the outside world.Just like this:But when I arrived, everything has changed. The life that in the eyes of people outside, especially some whites are very traditional and primitive and that ""China's dictatorship should not destroy them"" no longer exists. What I saw is this:Did you see the small village on the right side of the photo? The government moved most of the villagers down and built new houses for them, providing them with the convenience of opening hotels to receive tourists from outside. A museum was built in the local area to commemorate the workers and army that built the railway around the Mao era, which attracted a large number of tourists. Local people no longer have to live in poverty, but make money through the service industry. In this isolated place, there are water pipes, broadband networks and communication base stations, as well as this beautiful road on the water.Also,UHV power lines were set up in the sky to power them.These infrastructures are destined to lose millions of yuan per year.Some villagers remained on the cliff. It became a famous tourist attraction. When you climb the new road to the top of the mountain, you will see the open karst landscape and taste the organic food of the farmhouse. The villagers who stayed in the mountains earned more.The local even provides courier services. Products purchased by locals on Taobao will be delivered within one week.The local canyon is a very valuable tourist resource. If you are here, remember to experience it!Now I formally answer your question: 40 years ago, my government told my parents, please let the people of the east China become rich first, and ask the people of the west China to serve this situation for the time being. Later, the east will give back to the west.Now, the wealthy eastern part of China is bringing a steady stream of capital, technology, industry and thoughts to the west. My government has declared to all Chinese and the world that we must completely defeat poverty. Yes, this is a revolution, becauseI know that some people think that I am a wumao and do propaganda for the Chinese government. it does not matter.––––––Thanks everyone. I have noticed that some questions have been raised about how the local sustained loss infrastructure guarantees sustainability. The answer will start with both national policy and local industry.The Chinese government controls many companies that undertake infrastructure. These companies earn a lot of profits through their monopoly in the country. These profits will be forced to subsidize poor areas in the west to maintain the operation of good local infrastructure.Taking communication base stations as an example, the number of radio base stations deployed in China exceeds the sum of the world (China: about 6 million; other regions and countries: about 5.5 million.).Through the co-ordination of a strong central government, profits earned in wealthy areas are averaged in poor areas. The Chinese do not think this is unreasonable.But more importantly, the local industry needs to develop. Chinese people often say:授人以鱼不如授人以渔,which means to teach a man to fish instead of giving him a fish.Take my hometown as an example. Yunnan, Guizhou and Sichuan have very rich and high-quality tourism resources. As long as they are packaged and promoted, wealthy urban residents are happy to come on holiday.In the cliff village I mentioned, I rented a rubber boat to visit the local river. About 150 yuan. Watch the building on the left side of the photo, it is a resort. At the time, the facility was still under construction. I have had conversations with staff, and their employees are locals who can get a monthly salary of about 400 USD. Plus other local government measures (such as they don't have to pay for their children's education at all), this is enough to make them live a prosperous life.On the other hand, large-scale visitors will also significantly dilute the cost of local infrastructure and other necessities. Take a look at the vehicles in the photo below: These visitors have to park their cars on the side of the road because of the terrain and the restrictions on the parking lot under construction. I hope that this situation has now been improved.Finally, the most important thing is to give hope to the poor.This is another poor area I have traveled to. Guess what this building is used for?The answer is the school.This is the most beautiful campus I have ever seen. It is surrounded by green hills and rivers. The surrounding mountains are reinforced to prevent the destruction of geological disasters. Young people who graduate from college will be paid a high salary and return all tuition fees in cash if they come here for five years as teachers. Local children are admitted to the school for free, and the government provides additional accommodation and nutritious meals(Because it is located in the mountains, the settlements of local people are usually extremely scattered. Concentrating children would help to reduce costs and improve the quality of education).The local resource for attracting tourists is this.I assure you that in the villages and small towns of western China, the most beautiful buildings in the area must be schools and hospitals. For the inconvenient places like Cliff Village, the slow trains that have long been left unattended continue to operate for them to help them connect with the outside world. Cliff Village produces a kind of wild tea, known as Eagle Tea (it is said that the mountain eagle will eat the twig of this tea, hence the name), sold through Taobao.This is what I have seen and heard. I have visited many poor families, and their homes are hanged with portraits of the historical leaders of the PRC. Many Westerners may think that this is the return of authoritarianism, but I don't think so. I think this is human nature.I feel so glorious that I can live in such a country and make a negligible contribution to my country and people.China has more than Beijing, Shanghai or Hangzhou, Chengdu, and the beautiful countryside and forests of the west.We warmly welcome you to visit our country.

It took 10,000 years to try to bring to reality heavier than air flight as was demonstrated by the Wright Brothers in 1903.Once the practical possibility of flight was demonstrated, within a decade there were hundreds of successful technical innovators all around the world rapidly evolving heavier than air flight.We are today at a Wright Brothers stage of technical development with fusion. We actually have a working fission-fusion technology that reliably produces fusion energy with gain but we do not use it because of its military lineage and general fear of nuclear weapons.If carefully examined however, fission-fusion (and slightly more modern fusion-fission [1]) technology will be seen to be safe and practical providing energy yields per shot are reduced by about a factor of 100 - 1000 times and the devices are optimized for efficient ultra-clean power generation (not military blast effects).I think that if the object is to introduce a practical form of fusion in the least amount of time (10 years or less to commercial versions) then it is better to adapt currently working fission-fusion technology that actually historically worked the first time it was tried (and never failed thereafter) to be pure fusion rather than continue to try to improve pure fusion magnetic confinement fusion devices like tokamaks and stellarators that have historically never worked and have never once produced net energy in sixty long years of devoted experimental effort.No one alive currently knows what fusion technology will form the basis of future commercial fusion power generation. Tokamaks, including the smaller spherical tokamaks by fine nuclear startup firms like Tokamak energy, are sold to the public as continuous power generators while in fact only produce power in spurts of less than a couple of hundreds seconds at a time. This is because a transformer in the power supply is used to produce the huge currents in the plasma required to reach and then maintain fusion conditions This fact is not adequately explained by tokamak advocates (and these facts are typically not passed along by fusion professionals to the public leaving large portions of the public misinformed - believing that tokamak reactors produce smooth continuous power, when this is far from the case).Hundreds of Tokamaks, Stellarators, and other magnetic fusion designs have been built over the last 60 years and hundreds of thousands of shots have been made with these machines without a single instance of net power being demonstrated.Inertial Confinement Fusion is frequently criticized and public support withheld because ICF produces energy in a series of short controlled fusion bursts. People seem to like smooth power, not short repeated bursts of power. This preference for magentic confinement fusion projects among decision makers and the public is based however on misinformation that for decades has been carefully passed and then repassed as misinformation. Tokamaks, including the ITER tokamak and the ST 40 by Tokamak Energy, do not produce continuous power but rather produce somewhat irregular releases of power no longer than a few hundred seconds in duration at a time due to limitations in the Tokamak power supply that require use of high current transformers to produce the huge currents required in tokamak plasma current.Note: The record for tokamak fusion power generation is about 5 seconds while producing significant amounts of power (JET tokamak - 1996).Fission ignited Inertial Confinement Fusion worked the very first time it was tried (Ivy-Mike test) demonstrating fusion power generation with energy gain (fusion gain factor Qe=>100,000) and has never since failed to work.Technical evolution is the path to rapid innovation of commercial fusion -I think that if the object is to introduce a practical form of fusion in the least amount of time (10 years or less to commercial versions) - then it is better to adapt fission-fusion technology that worked the first time it was tried (and never failed) to be pure fusion rather than continue to try to improve magnetic confinement fusion devices that have never worked and never once produced net energy even once in sixty long years of devoted efforts.Fission-fusion is not unicorns, science fiction, or BS.Practical fusion will always be 50+ years ago (not always 30 years away).Inertial confinement fusion is the only form of fusion that has actually already been proven to work in actual field experiments (not just in computer simulations). In the final few years on underground nuclear testing, both LANL and LLNL designed a series of test shots called Halite-Centurion. Halite-Centurion series shots were fusion related add on shots piggy-backed onto DOE-DOD shots already on the schedule. These shots were designed to utilize a small portion of the X-rays produced from the primary of an experimental device through a line of sight to ignite a remote fusion experiment housed some distance away in the underground experimental test canister.Once classified Halite-Centurion test shots experimentally proved that small DT filled spheres could be ignited and brought to full fusion ignition using an intense beam of X-rays generated in the primary of an experimental fission device.During the last decade of the cold war, ICF fusion was experimentally PROVEN to work by both LANL and LLNL field test divisions. If fusion drivers are designed that sufficiently resemble the characteristics and performance of X-ray driver used in Halite-Centurion experiments, there is NO QUESTION that full pure fusion ignition with fusion energy gain will be practically achieved.LLNL’s Dr. Ralph Moir has over recent decades worked on a variety of advanced fusion reactor designs. Ralph’s designs are good and deserve more attention and study than they have to date received.More information on successful ICF cold war Halite-Centurion Field Tests -The following document contains what John Lindl was permitted to release publicly regarding Halite-Centurion ICF by DOE""Note:It is not possible to carry off a Small ICF fusion-fission or pure fusion device and explode it to create damage (as it requires a large and non-portable fusion driver [Laser, Heavy Ion Particle Accelerator, etc.] to initiate the ignition of the fusion target device).There is no essential difference between a Small ICF fusion-fission or pure fusion device and NIF Laser Fusion or Sandia z-pinch fusion targets which all produce energy through the same fusion reactions in a series of small controlled fusion bursts.A Small ICF fusion-fission or pure fusion device is not a weapon, it is a fusion target of advanced design that is carefully designed to maximize production of heat energy (and neutrons) from fusion and minimize the production of fission products from the fissile (U-233 or Pu-239) igniter.While you could kill someone by igniting a low yield fusion target, you could also kill someone with small quantities of many other energy producing fuels like burning a gallon of gasoline.Comparison of some current ICF fusion approaches -All current Inertial Confinement Fusion concepts currently are repetitive pulse energy generators producing energy through a succession of controlled small fusion bursts.National Ignition Facility currently produces a 54 kilojoule burst of fusion energy per shot which is the energy produced from burning 0.0004 gallons of automotive gasoline (while producing no net energy)Sandia z-pinch experiment produces a 30 Megajoules burst per shot which is the energy produced by burning 0.23 gallons of gasoline (while producing no net energy)A small ICF fusion-fission or pure fusion device optimized for power generation as has been discussed in this Quora article is designed to produce 250 x 10^3 Megajoules of energy per shot which is the energy produced by burning about 1900 gallons of gasoline (with commercially significant, large, usable amounts of net energy).
