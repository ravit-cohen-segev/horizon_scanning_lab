4,"I am the ultimate master at cramming for tests. For this question, I'm going to assume you're talking about VERY IMPORTANT, DIFFICULT tests. I'll categorize the following items into three categories: cramming three days before, and cramming the night before, and cramming like RIGHT before.Cramming 3 days before:First Day= Scan the material with a highlighter QUICKLY/Watch all the lectures on 1.5x speed.Second and Third Day= Jump into practice tests right away (or redo all of your HW if you don't have them). Eat well and sleep around 6 hours. Don't bother making flashcards or whatever, but takeI am the ultimate master at cramming for tests. For this question, I'm going to assume you're talking about VERY IMPORTANT, DIFFICULT tests. I'll categorize the following items into three categories: cramming three days before, and cramming the night before, and cramming like RIGHT before.Cramming 3 days before:First Day= Scan the material with a highlighter QUICKLY/Watch all the lectures on 1.5x speed.Second and Third Day= Jump into practice tests right away (or redo all of your HW if you don't have them). Eat well and sleep around 6 hours. Don't bother making flashcards or whatever, but take notes on what you've missed and dive into the material again afterwards.Do 30 jumping jacks every two hours to keep your blood flowing. Don't fool around with caffeine, you'll regret it. Put your phone on do-not-disturb.Cramming the night before:Sleep is for the weak. And chuck your phone out the window.But don't kill the phone, you'll need it for last-minute help from your friends. You'll also need it for studying in the bathroom when the coffee hits your system.Just sit down and crash the material. Start off making two cups of coffee. Put 1 of them in the freezer, and sip the other. Don't chug it all in one go though.DO NOT STUDY IN YOUR BEDROOM. You will fall asleep, guaranteed. I don't care how strong you think you are. You'll fail.So sit down at a table and spend, maybe, 1 hour reviewing. If you have practice tests, then dive into them. If you don't, redo ALL of the homework assignments.Around 4–7AM, you're going to feel drowsy. Find that slightly frozen coffee and drink it down.Eat something with this cup. No fruits or vegetables or sweets. Eat protein or healthy grains.An hour or so before the test, focus on rereading the material. Trust me, this will save your ass. You need to re-absorb.If possible, take a really short (5 min) run right before reviewing. If not, don't stress about it, but the run will definitely help.Right before you take the test, you're going to feel really jittery from the coffee and the nerves. DO NOT FRANTICALLY REVIEW 15–20 minutes before the test.This will destroy you… I can't tell you how many times I did this and had a melt down when the test was given to me. Or I saw something wrong while rushing and started getting conflicted.Just sit down and breathe. Concentrate on breathing in and out.Finally, ace your test. Go with your gut answer, don't try to logic it out too much. Just trust me. If you try to argue with yourself, you're going to end up with a trash answer. You've been up all night. Go with your gut.Cramming RIGHT before:This is the most desperate of cases, but it still can be successful.What you CAN do is ask your friends for the answers to the practice test. Then look over how they're solved and write down the hardest things.You can also ask them for the hardest material. Then, rush through it and work down from there.If you can, reread all of the material with a highlighter. Don't write anything down.Don't bother breathing or eating or pooping.On the test, logic EVERYTHING out. I'm assuming you had a decent night of sleep. Just think about what the best answer would be.As you can tell, I am qUItE experienced with cramming for tests. I've been doing it for years, and these methods are what work best for me (A- at the very lowest). Everyone's different, obviously, so you'll have to experiment to find your own method.The best thing would be to just NOT PROCRASTINATE and study well.But good luck with whatever test you have!","7,036 followers",Rob Ennals,673,130,3.1M,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-best-possible-strategy-to-study-for-UGC-NET-Tourism-Administration-and-Managment

Understanding the context and hybe’s responIntro: Whalien 52↳ ❝ [Eh, do you want to know my story?wealthy families will invest millions of dollars in an entertainment company to secure their child’s future as an idol.This theory will be revolved around Kim Garam and her bullying scandal.Before we get into this, quick disclaimer:I support Le Sserafim as a group but I will not turn a blind eye to Garam and her scandals especially now that they’re true. Remember that this is just a theory and not an actual fact.The first few sections will be about the case. Understanding the context and hybe’s responses will help you understand my theory.Background:News broke out that Garam’s bullying allegations were true through a law firm. Victim Yoo Eun-seo testified and revealed all the circumstances in which she suffered school violence. The case goes back four years as the victim suffered from abuse from Garam and her friends. She was unable to endure the group violence and transferred to another school.As a result, on June 4th, 2018, Kim Garam received six hours of special education and five hours of special education for parents under Article 17 of the Act on the Prevention and Countermeasures of School Violence. The victim had received counseling and protective measures from the same act.When Yoo was accused and threatened by more unidentified people (believing that she was the one to bully Garam), which was then only strengthened by Hybe’s previous statement, the second indiscriminate assault on her intensified. Garam continued with her “entertainment activities” and ignored everything. The victim couldn't handle the extreme anxiety and made a suicide attempt.HYBE’s response:Hello, This is HYBE and Source MusicEarlier this afternoon, law firm Daeryun shared their position on their client's statement accusing LE SSERAFIM's Kim Garam of alleged school violence, and it was sent to media.Firstly, we regret Daeryun unilaterally announced their position to a large number of media outlets despite the fact that minors are involved in the controversy related to LE SSERAFIM's Kim Garam.We'd like to say Daeryun compiled and published the events from 2018 in such a way that makes their side look advantageous, so we'll compile and share our official position shortly. Journalists should refrain from reporting on one-sided arguments.Once again, the controversy began with the spread of false information about a member about to debut. Considering this act of spreading false information was malicious, we immediately took legal action, and we're still proceeding with this process.Though the member was the target of malicious attacks from those online hiding behind anonymity, we didn't actively explain the details as a lot of those involved were in their first year of middle school, and they're still minors.However, the details in the 2018 case are only being communicated through one point of view, so we'll clarify and release our position as soon as our review of Daeryun's claims is done.Additional response from HybeThey start off with wanting to clarify any details revolving the allegations and explain why they refrained from clarifying details confirmed through many third parties; they feared that personal information of minors would be revealed.Their post mentions that Yoo Eun Seo took a photo of a classmate who was changing at school and was only wearing an underwear. She posted it without the classmate’s permission and Garam confronted Eun Seo about this however there was no physical violence. Eun seo admitted her wrong doings but wasn’t punished for her actions. However she pointed out the classmates who had confronted her and referred them to the school violence committee, and then transferred to another school. As a result, Garam and her friends were punished by the committee.Kim Garam was friends with Yoo Eun seo for two months (beginning of first grade middle school) however they had an argument and it was revealed that Eun Seo had bad mouthed Garam and her other friends. It did come to a close after an apology. Due to this incident, Garam cut off ties with Eun Seo.They then go onto say how Garam was also a victim of malicious rumors. Some students forced Garam and her friends into a group chat and teased or cursed at them. In addition, some students from other school who don’t know Garam attacked her and her friends. They debunk other rumors and then say how Garam suffered from psychological hardships and how she’ll need to take a break. This means that Le Sserafim will only temporarily promote as five members.(they never talk about the 5th level punishment)Extra Information/evidence:A lot of classmates are speaking up on multiple korean forums. One student mentions how there are more than just one or two victims. They even said the head of the department (hybe) showed up to the school to “shut [their] mouths.”The ministry of education (it is very rare for the ministry to be involved in a bully scandal) has stated,“In the case of school violence, the intensity of the measures taken by each school is also difference because of the strong autonomous nature and the difference tendencies of participating experts [in these committees]. However it seems to be true that there was school violence, as Kim Garam was named as an assailant student.”Basically they just confirmed Garam to be the perpetrator.There was a post that was uploaded onto Jishikin at a similar timeframe to Garam’s school violence. (Jishikin is similar to Quora.)Q: Concerning Article 17 (1) #5 of the Prevention of School ViolenceThis got recorded when I was in middle school.I'm planning to go to a performing art school, if this was documented when I was in my first year of middle school, will it disadvantage me from entering that school? And is the disposition I received worth being erased?This post was written on March 1st of 2020 which means Garam would’ve been in 3rd grade middle school. June 4th, 2018 was when the case was brought forth to the committee. The date when the countermeasures punishment was enacted on the post above was July 9th 2018.There is a chance this isn’t her however the time frames are uncanny. Lawyers have stated “in general it is extremely rare to issue a 5th level disposition in the absence of physical violence.”Now here’s where it really starts to get very strange. Hybe stated this as a response:“5th level punishment was issued even though there was no physical violence. Since the school violence committee is not a court, each case, school, region, and person in charge proceeds differently.”“At that time, Kim Garam’s mother believed that the school would have provided the most helpful direction for her child, so she did not go through the process of appealing the punishment. Now, she regrets accepting it without raising any objections, but back then, she believed it was the best thing to do for her child’s education.”If you read the summarized post from hybe, this only creates more inconsistency. In fact, they just supported the opposition. In Hybe’s previous post they say how Garam was the one to be bullied and how she only confronted Eun Seo about the picture she supposedly uploaded of her classmate. If she had just confronted her with no violence, it’s strange that 5th level punishment was issued.The Theory:So after all of this, you might wondering, why are Hybe going throughIf they can dismantle gfriend with no warning, who’s to say they can’t kick Garam out?Many people believe that Garam is backed up by someone powerful. Others think that it’s blackmail. Some people think that hybe has already planned too much into le sserafim’s debut and they don’t want to remove her.Here’s my theory:Garam’s family heavily invested in Hybe to secure their daughter’s future as an idol and are controlling how hybe responds to the situation by threatening to pull out of the company.We don’t truly know Garam’s family background but the assumption that her family is an average earning one flew right out the window after Hybe’s adamant behavior. If they were really a middle class family with no power, then hybe wouldn’t have a problem with kicking Garam out.She trained for only a year and still lacks basic skills. She was pushed by hybe to be the center of the group and was promoted as the “real”Hybe is a public company, meaning people can own shares. The more shares one has, the more control they have over the company. When a company goes public, a major goal is to not lose investors because losing investors means losing money. Poor public image and indefinite future can lead to them pulling out.By that logic, wouldn’t it make sense for them to get rid of Garam? Yes…unless Garam’s parents areHere’s how the stakes are divided up in Hybe:Garam’s parents are most likely in the third category.Alright here’s a small business lesson:If a major investor pulls out of a company and decides to sell their shares, then the value of the company’s stock will fall. This means that the individual share a holder owns no longer has the same value as it did. As a result, they’re not earning as much money. When this happens confidence amongst other investors falls drastically leading them to sell their shares back to the company but due to low value, the company isn’t receiving as much money.To compensate, the company has to sell additional shares to raise money and if it has fell by a large amount, a company might be forced to borrow to raise money which is more expensive. If a company is able to keep major investors, then it can prompt other investors to stay as well.If you look at Hybe’s stocks over the past 6 months:It’s decreased. There are many factors to this such as no comebacks, but the point is, the stock value is already low meaning the demand for shares has decreased. The last thing Hybe wants is for a major investor like Garam’s parents to leave causing the value to drop even more.Her parents invested in hybe in the first place because they wanted to secure a career for their daughter.Garam is only a small yet strong example of the overarching theory:I understand that this may sound strange, but if we were to change the statement to “people invest for their children’s future”, it all of the sudden makes sense. Parents invest in their kids, that’s a given, an example being college. If a child’s future career plan is to be a singer, then their parents will invest in things that’ll help them achieve their goals (it could be as simple as vocal lessons). Garam wanted to be a singer since she was in Kindergarten and so her parents invested in hybe so they could secure her dream.This may sound brutal, but every year, we see idols that debut who are clearly not fit to be idols. So why do they still debut? There are a multitude of reasons but a contributing one is their parents paying or investing hefty amounts of money for them to debut. Why compete with someone else when you can just buy your way to the top.Kpop is truly a lot darker than we think.Sources:Ask Matt: How falling stock price can hurt a company[theqoo] ADDITIONAL CLARIFICATION FROM HYBE ABOUT KIM GARAM (FT.

6,"I don’t believe in most of these conspiracy theories, but I really wanted to answer this question so I will be naming a few popular Kpop conspiracy theories!There’s an invisible eighth member in BTSSome BTS fans say that they can sense a missing eighth member of the group. The speculation stems from an early photo of the group taken before their mainstream debut at the offices of Big Hit. The shot features the seven current members and one extra person: Supreme Boi.Supreme Boi was originally a contender to be in the band too, but he didn't like the way Bang PD was taking the band's direction.I don’t believe in most of these conspiracy theories, but I really wanted to answer this question so I will be naming a few popular Kpop conspiracy theories!There’s an invisible eighth member in BTSSome BTS fans say that they can sense a missing eighth member of the group. The speculation stems from an early photo of the group taken before their mainstream debut at the offices of Big Hit. The shot features the seven current members and one extra person: Supreme Boi.Supreme Boi was originally a contender to be in the band too, but he didn't like the way Bang PD was taking the band's direction. So, he became one of their producers. One logical explanation is that he’s in this early photograph for that reason. However, some reckon that BTS was always meant to have eight members, and for whatever reason, there’s a detectable presence of this missing person. In many photographs of the group, there’s an ominous gap where you’d expect to see an extra member.SM Entertainment clones their artistsPeople think that SM Entertainment clones their artists because they already know that their visuals are liked by the public. So SM just clones them instead of finding new artists because that would be too risky. If you look at the members of kpop groups under SM entertainment, you can tell that many of them look similar to one another. I mean look at these side by side comparisons of these idols:EXO’s Suho and Red Velvet’s IreneKangta, Siwon, and SuhoJYJ’s Jaejoong and NCT’s TaeyongNCT Lucas and Shinee MinhoKrystal and NCT JaehyunSHINEE’s Taemin and NCT’s Jungwoo (they literally look the same wtf)Sunmi got pregnant with Jay ParkTo this day, fans still believe there is more to Jay Park’s departure that the public does not know. People think that Sunmi got pregnant with Jay Park since the timing of their departures from their groups were similar and tied hand in hand. When looking at the timing, Jay Park left 2PM in late 2009 and Sunmi left Wonder Girls in February 2010. More people began to speculate this theory because Jay Park had once mentioned that he learned Korean by talking to women. Some people also think that JYP found out about Sunmi’s pregnancy and purposefully leaked Jay Park’s controversial MySpace comments as a punishment.Jeongyun and Jimin dated and ended on bad terms/ they hate each otherDuring a Music Bank show, Jeongyeon was singing (along with BTS) to Spring Day. In the clip, Jimin glanced in her direction with a “glaring” face expression.I’m pretty sure Jimin just glanced her way because he was curious about who was singing, but some people thought that he was judging Jeongyeon or that he was annoyed that she was “interrupting the song”. Anyways, then there were videos of Jeongyeon having a salty or annoyed face every time Jimin was mentioned or if he appeared on screen or if a BTS song were playing. So some people think that either they just hate each other, they dated and ended on bad terms, or they are dating. Here’s a video of their “beef.”In Produce 101, Season 2, JR was made to lose so that people would gain sympathy for him and Nu'est could get a “re-debut”For those that don’t know, JR is a singer, rapper, actor, and leader of the kpop group NU'EST. Many fans were skeptical that JR was 1st for 2 episodes and then 7th in the episode before the final, meaning that he did in fact have enough people to vote for him. It could all be a coincidence that JR lost, but fans found it to be suspicious. JR had always ranked in the top 10 and people found it hard to believe that his fans wouldn't vote for him in the final vote when it mattered the most. His loss made it a very good opportunity for Nu'est to be more recognized and for them to receive more love, popularity, and recognition.Red Velvet has comebacks/their debut to distract the public from the overload of SME scandalsMany people believe that Red Velvet’s debut was pushed forward to distract from the SM scandals in 2014. Many fans speculate that this explains why Yeri was not in the video/ promotions and why the “Happiness” music video had issues and were fixed later. During the scandals of Jessica leaving Girl’s Generation and when Luhan leaving Exo, Red Velvet had their “Be Natural” comeback. Another example was when Red Velvet had their “Russian Roulette” comeback during the scandal of Tiffany having a Japan flag on Korean Independence day. When 2NE1 disbanded and Henry complained about SM, they had their “Rookie” comeback. Lastly, when SISTAR disbanded, Choa left AOA, and T.O.P. was involved in a drug scandal, Red Velvet had their “Red Flavor” comeback. All of this might be a coincidence because SME tends to be associated with many scandals, but there seems to be a lot of evidence for fans to believe in this conspiracy theory.",4 followers,Eliz,2.1K,0,0,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-best-possible-strategy-to-study-for-UGC-NET-Tourism-Administration-and-Managment

But it just makes sense, she commited literally a month after Sulli did and they are best friends.that’s all I believe. this question was really fun to answer so I thank this question for existing lmaoooo.also,,, don’t believe everything you see on the internetThese people are amazing at photo shop. There is nothing wrong with kpop idols Dating ofc, but think about…ok I’m ranting now but what I am trying to say issurprise! idols are human. You shouldn’t force conspiracies and scandals that may not be true on them. Imagine how you would feel with all your fans on the line. Stressed.

Luckily for JYPE, it succeeded. The man behind the company might have a crazy amount of confidence, but doing this is extremely bold.I do not find the fishy meme funny, however that’s not much of the essence here. The entire teaser is way too out there for the meme to be but a coincidental funny detail they forget to edit out. If my theory is correct, the company consists of actual geniuses. And that scares me for the future of K-Pop ‘funny’ contentThank you for reading.P.S.: Can K-Pop companies stop giving their album titles Latin names? At this point it’s just cringeworthy and doesn’t make any sense at all. They gave a ‘Why Not’ themed concept an album with the title about the ocean. I’m honestly ready for the explanation behind that choice we’ll never get because Latin is more quirky than Fromis_9 stans think they are.U&ME♡",158 followers,Yourlocalnetizen,780,180,2.4M,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-best-possible-strategy-to-study-for-UGC-NET-Tourism-Administration-and-Managment

So this tool would be perfect for controlling K-pop idols so every little action they do is perfect.I actually believe that idols might switch to a different alter that has a demon attached to it and are actually possessed on stage.

The companies aren’t doing anything illegal or shady, and the fanbases of their artists still very much work to earn their crowns, it’s just an interesting tendency to observe.I’m writing this on September 24, so I could only include music show awards that were announced already, however if we look forward, JYPE-SM Entertainment is expected to sweep almost every crown for the next weeks:",0 followers,Keith Albert,6.3K,602,20M,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-K-pop-conspiracy-theories-that-you-believe

In a vlive Shuhua talked about how when she was still a trainee, she would hide in the stairs just to eat chips, coz that was the only place that didn't have cameras. That's really fucked. Not to mention the weekly weigh ins. Companies put these trainees through too much.The results were that the girls debuted looking incredibly skinny. As most groups do. But then after debut, it seems the company stopped caring. They could eat as they liked, at least more so.In GIDLE’s I Talk behind videos you can even see them eating chocolates and Macdonalds, a stark contrast to hiding just to eat a small snack.This to me explains why they looked so much older by the time Hann came. They were allowed to eat normally and from the weight they gained their faces grew into how they would normally look rather than their starved look.The pressure trainees are put through to debut alone is insane, but to add starving them to the point of them looking so much different from how they should is just too much.And all of that just for debut photoshoots, so they can say their idols are X weight and abandon it all right after.",0 followers,Jackson Brownlee,9.3K,181,12.1M,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-K-pop-conspiracy-theories-that-you-believe
