The black things on the right are fans. They are tiny, and they spin really really fast to cool the 2 Xeons CPUs with tiny heatsinks. The only reason those CPUs don’t overheat despite such tiny heatsinks is there is an incredible amount of airflow over them. That’s why the fans sound like jet engines.The SuperMicro motherboard uses a proprietary form factor, and only has a VGA output. PCI-E slots are available if you plug in an expansion card (so the video card would be mounted on an expansion card that’s plugged into the motherboard). That’s how they can fit something like a video card in a case that thin. The video card would be parallel to the motherboard, not perpendicular like they usually are on consumer motherboards.So I had to design and use a laser cutter to build my own case out of acrylic, after finding new (and bigger) heatsinks for the CPUs.This is what I ended up with:Why go through all this trouble? I got a dual Xeon (2x8 cores then, 2x10 cores now) workstation with 64GB of memory for A LOT cheaper than what they normally cost. Was it worth it? That depends on how much I value my time spent getting it to work… but that’s part of the fun.I am typing this answer on that computer (though it has been upgraded to water cooling).More details.",5 followers,Matthew Lai,3K,3.9K,13.2M,https://www.quora.com/How-large-is-a-super-computer

Moreover, they think the Big Bang theory was invented - out of thin air - purely so that scientists could avoid the self-evident fact that God created the universe.Well, that’s not how the Big Bang theory came about, and in fact the Big Bang theory is not even about the origin of the universe.We can see that the universe is expanding. That means it must have been smaller (actually “denser” is a better way to look at it) in the past, right?

Nothing outrageous, no denying self-evident truths about God, just a straightforward (or straightCongratulations, you now accept the Big Bang theory! (that wasn’t so bad, now was it?)Despite what you may have heard, the Big Bang theory has nothing to do with how the universe was created - it’s simply a description of how a very dense, very hot, region of spacetime could have expanded and cooled off to produce what we see today. It’s called the Big Bang theory to distinguish it from the now-discredited Steady State theory, which proposed that the universe was NOT denser in the past.Where did that early universe come from? No one knows! The Big Bang theory has been tracked backwards to a tiny fraction of a second after the universe came to be - and if it’s true, then there would be observable consequences today, like the Cosmic Microwave Background. When we look at the CMB, we see exactly what we’d expect to see if the universe really did expand from a very hot, very dense, starting configuration. So we’ve got good reasons to think we’re on the right track.Maybe God did create that early universe. Or maybe he created our universe 6,000 years ago, and just created all the galaxies flying apart to fool us (though one wonders why God would basically lie to us like that). Or maybe he created the universe at midnight last night - not only creating galaxies in a “flying apart as if they had been together ~13.8 billions years ago” configuration, but creating the neurons in your brain in the same configuration they would have been in had you actually grown up, went to school, had your first kiss, etc.All of those things are technically possible - but until/unless there’s any evidence for them (spoiler: there isn’t), science can’t really do much with those ideas. Science doesn’t say there isn’t a God, it just says that most things don’t seem to reallyIt’s like plumbing: there are religious plumbers, and atheist plumbers - but they all need to know that water flows downhill. There’s no obvious benefit to having a religious plumber - he can’t “bless” your pipes and make them better somehow. When you go to plumbing school, they don’t",UNKNOWN,Viktor T.

5,"Q: Do you think the Big Bang theory is wrong? Why or why not?A: If there is anything that science history has shown, then it is that we don’t reveal the whole truth. The universe is reluctant in revealing its secrets.Take for instance the Big Bang Theory. About 100 years ago, science thought that the universe was static and infinite in time, but limited to the Milky Way galaxy, and that everything beyond that was a big dark eternal void.But something happened then:Q: Do you think the Big Bang theory is wrong?

About 100 years ago, science thought that the universe was static and infinite in time, but limited to the Milky Way galaxy, and that everything beyond that was a big dark eternal void.But something happened then:They also predicted that the universe was not static. Einstein didn’t like that idea, and spent years trying to find a “cosmological constant” to make the universe static again. But up comes this Belgian astrophysicist and Catholic priest,Then along came a lawyer and changed career to astronomer,He did so measuring two things. The first was the distance to galaxies, using a particular kind of stars called cepheids that are variable in a period depending on how bright they actually are. So if you know how fast cepheids vary, you know how bright they actually are, and that means that you can measure how bright they appear to be to figure out how far they have to be to appear to be that dim.The other thing was the spectrum. He noticed that the spectrum from distant galaxies was very similar to our, but almost always shifted towards the red part of the spectrum. It’s a bit similar to listening to the Doppler effect of a passing train, but with light. The lower the frequency = the redder the light, the faster they move away from us.Then he did his great deduction: no matter where you were, it would look the same. And that meant that the universe was expanding. AndOf course, not everyone accepted that. It was just one line of evidence, after all. Science was split right down the middle, of those that accepted the expanding universe, and those that scoffed it off. One of the scoffers wereHowever, we’re not done yet. Our story is just in then 1940s. In the late 1940s, several scientists predicted that if the universe was smaller once upon a time, then it would also be hotter. That head would still be there and manifest itself as a background radiation remnant in the microwave spectrum, with a temperature of about 3–5 Kelvin.In the 1960s, two astronomers,So that settles it? Not quite. We’re still in the 1960s. For the next decades, more and more precise measurements were made to establish the age of the universe. In the 1960s, it was between 10 and 20 billion years; and in the 1980s, it was between 10 and 15 billion years.In the 1990s, something phenomenal happened: the internet. It allowed scientists to coordinate observations around the globe. One such team used a special kind of supernovae, type 1A, to determine the distance to galaxies and the speed of them. Type 1A supernovae happens when white dwarfs get massive enough to rekindle fusion. It always happen at the same stellar mass, so they are always as energetic and bright. That means that they are excellent as “standard candles” like the cepheids that Hubble used. Two teams independently of one another managed to show that the universe was not only expanding, but even speeding up!We also got better instruments. Using satellites observatories like COBE and WMAP, we have better images of the cosmic microwave background radiation, so that we even can set a rather precise age to the universe, 13.79 billion years.And that’s roughly where we are today, a century after Einstein’s theories of relativity that started it all.Do I believe in it? Sure. I have no reason not to. I can read up on every step, even repeat some of the earlier steps on my own (the latter steps require a lot more money and work, but others have already done that). I even have repeated some of those earlier experiments myself as a student.And in fact, it is difficult for me to even grasp why you shouldn’t in the light of a century of gathering evidence. The only reason I can think of is being a fundamentalist believer in a religion with a creation story that says different than the mountain of evidence.And that has some theological implications: that must necessarily mean that if the creation story is true, and that mountain of evidence is false, then the creator god is a deceiving god that put false evidence in his creation.

A clearer picture.Till we arrived at.And then we monitored it over time, and found patternsAnd the more and more closely the patterns were looked at, they revealed a polarization.And the polarization was of two types. E-mode and B-mode.They are propagation patterns.The so-called “evidence” of the Big Bang is a pattern of E-mode and B-mode oscillations/wave functions.They are what the CMB is “made of”.If you put them together, 1 e-mode + 1 b-mode, they make a mathematical object.that I have labelled a Universal Building Block.That mathematical object was published in an issue of Scientific American.I found it in that article, and decided to investigate whether it might represent a tiny universal building block. A solid tiny particle which replicated an infinite number of times makes a quadroplar mechanical medium that creates and hosts existence as we observe and experience it.Whereby all things we observe and experience as being physical, are actually persistent patterns propagating through the medium composed of the universal building blocks.If this is how reality/existence work, then the CMB is NOT evidence of a big bang, and a beginning to time, space, the universe, and existence.Instead, the CMB is an interference pattern. The result of the breakdown of energy coming and going. Energy coming towards us, and receding away from us. Splitting into images/oscillations, of the mathematics of the underlying host medium.The “fraying” of the strings of energy. The pushes and the pulls.So we can either conclude, there is a Planck Scale Mechanical Field that hosts existence and is made of Universal Building Blocks.OR we can conclude that the universe had a miraculous moment of birthing, whereby time and space themselves “began”, and from nothingness did spring forth several hundred billion-trillion stars plus all energy and matter and dark energy and dark matter and forces that we believe the universe might be made out of.…..When confronted with two possibilities, the simpler one is often the one found ultimately correct.Unless proven otherwise, I side with the existence of Universal Building Blocks, and an infinite, eternal universal existence.Not a miraculous birthing and all sorts of forces and such.See, there is confusion as to what reality is made of.And my conclusion is a Planck Scale Mechanical Field. Which in turn creates a an omni-oriented spin field, that “splits” into clockwise and counter-clockwise poles, which will be attracted to and orbit one another. And create persistent patterns (electrons, protons, neutrons, etc), which will then form larger structures (elements, then molecules, then objects, stars, planets, galaxies) which will propagate through the underlying medium, hosted by it. Pulled by it and pushed by it.And that such is what existence/reality/the universe is made out of.",254 followers,Bhanu Swaroop,7.1K,0,0,https://www.quora.com/Do-you-believe-in-the-Big-Bang-Theory-I-dont-so-is-there-another-theory-better-than-it
