It can teach you critical thinking, superior writing skills, and important basic knowledge about the world and how it works. You can learn about politics, economics, more or less anything you want. And, there’s nothing whatsoever that says, “I majored in X, so I can only get a job in X.” Major in history, go become an insurance underwriter, or a security analyst, or a stockbroker, or a lawyer… or whatever.

It can teach you critical thinking, superior writing skills, and important basic knowledge about the world and how it works. You can learn about politics, economics, more or less anything you want. And, there’s nothing whatsoever that says, “I majored in X, so I can only get a job in X.” Major in history, go become an insurance underwriter, or a security analyst, or a stockbroker, or a lawyer… or whatever. Fact is, unlike graduates with many other degrees, if you’re smart, and apply yourself, you’ll be able to think, and you’ll be flexible enough to adapt.Don’t get me wrong: you’ll have to work hard, be clever, and sell yourself like a huckster to get ahead, but that’s true no matter what.What others have said here is true: there aren’t a lot of jobs in history. If you want one, you have to be not just really good, but also really, cussedly persistent. Look up the word “limpet.” You need to be a brilliant limpet. On the other hand, if this is you, the future isn’t actually that bad. So many students are opting not to pursue a future in history that the field is actually clearing up some, which is good. Bear in mind, though, that we’re talking about very limited opportunities for a small handful of fortunate people; and we’re talking about salaries that won’t seem very impressive compared to the monstrous sums paid to legions of no-talent business wonks. You’ll never get paid what you’re actually worth, because we live in a civilization that simply doesn’t value education, and which certainly doesn’t value history, to its great, great cost. But a real historian doesn’t care. You don’t listen to Clio’s musings for the money; you do it because history is a calling.","6,695 followers",Thomas B Walsh,694,11.9K,37.7M,https://www.quora.com/Is-there-any-scope-for-a-career-if-I-do-double-majors-in-history-and-psychology-1
