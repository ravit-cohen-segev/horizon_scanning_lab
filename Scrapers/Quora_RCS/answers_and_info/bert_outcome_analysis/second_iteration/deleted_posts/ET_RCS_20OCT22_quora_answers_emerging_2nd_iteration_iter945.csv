If you’ve ever seen the movieComputers have been used since NASA formed on July 29, 1958. In the early days, during Mercury and Gemini, NASA computers were actually people. Mathematicians would work out all of the mathematics required to figure reentry points, landing zones, and all, by hand. If you’ve ever seen the movieAfter the IBM 7090 came online, NASA phased out human computes and began hiring computer programmers instead. From there, computers became more and more important in spacecraft design, flight, and control.Spacecraft DesignEarly in the US human space program, the rockets used to launch the Mercury and Gemini astronauts into space were re-purposed ICBMs. As a quick side note, the initial space race with the then USSR was all about missile development. Sputnik was a shot across the American collective bow, so to speak, because all the USSR did was hollow out the payload area of a nuclear missile and stuck a metal sphere with a radio transmitter in it and flew it over the continental United States.At any rate, Mercury and Gemini rockets were just reused ICBMs. The capsules that held and protected the astronauts, however, had to be designed by hand. This involved studying various high-speed aircraft and building many wind tunnel models and studying their aerodynamics. As the Apollo program got started, more and more calculations required to design the rocket were done by computer, but physical wind tunnel testing was still the primary means of verifying design requirements. It wasn’t until the start of the Space Shuttle program that the majority of the design process moved to the digital realm. Physical wind tunnel models of the Space Shuttle were still required and built, but as computers really increased in power, a lot of the initial design work was done by super computers. The ISS, being that it’s a space station and not designed for (much) atmospheric contact, was designed entirely by computers. Some smaller parts meant for crew use were prototyped, but by and large, the ISS was completely designed by computers. From the ISS on, most space craft will be designed and tested completely by computers until verification flight hardware is required. This allows developers to very quickly (and cheaply) design, test, and redesign hardware.FlightOne thing that’s been constant on all manned spacecraft since Yuri Gagarin is computes in space craft. Obviously, the early computers weren’t very powerful and could only handle a few inputs and output at a time. “Mission Profiles” were developed and loaded into the computers before launch and only a few things could be changed by the astronaut on board (like retro rocket firing for reentry). Fast forward to Apollo, and you’ll see on board computers handle more and more functions on board the space craft until you get to the space shuttle, which was completely controlled by numerous on board computers. The ISS has computers all over the place that control many different things, both internal to the pressurized volume and external where many payloads and replacements live.ControlMost people recognize scenes and pictures of mission control here in Houston, TX: skinny black tie, black rimmed glasses, and pea-soup green data on a tiny monitor. Those were the old days. This is now:This is the mission control of the 21st century. Each console position controls a particular piece (or set of pieces) of the space craft (in this case, the ISS). Data from the space craft is pipped into Mission Control and sent to the correct screens. However, it wasn’t always this way. For the first few programs of NASA (Mercury and Gemini), space craft control was handled by radar ground sites all over the globe. These ground sites tracked the space craft while it was in space allowing the ground team to talk to the astronauts in space, and receive data from the spacecraft itself.

His thoughtful reply was later published by NASA, and titled, ""Why Explore Space?""(May 6, 1970May 6, 1970Dear Sister Mary Jucunda:Your letter was one of many which are reaching me every day, but it has touched me more deeply than all the others because it came so much from the depths of a searching mind and a compassionate heart. I will try to answer your question as best as I possibly can.First, however, I would like to express my great admiration for you, and for all your many brave sisters, because you are dedicating your lives to the noblest cause of man: help for his fellowmen who are in need.You asked in your letter how I could suggest the expenditures of billions of dollars for a voyage to Mars, at a time when many children on this Earth are starving to death. I know that you do not expect an answer such as ""Oh, I did not know that there are children dying from hunger, but from now on I will desist from any kind of space research until mankind has solved that problem!"" In fact, I have known of famined children long before I knew that a voyage to the planet Mars is technically feasible. However, I believe, like many of my friends, that travelling to the Moon and eventually to Mars and to other planets is a venture which we should undertake now, and I even believe that this project, in the long run, will contribute more to the solution of these grave problems we are facing here on Earth than many other potential projects of help which are debated and discussed year after year, and which are so extremely slow in yielding tangible results.Before trying to describe in more detail how our space program is contributing to the solution of our Earthly problems, I would like to relate briefly a supposedly true story, which may help support the argument. About 400 years ago, there lived a count in a small town in Germany. He was one of the benign counts, and he gave a large part of his income to the poor in his town. This was much appreciated, because poverty was abundant during medieval times, and there were epidemics of the plague which ravaged the country frequently. One day, the count met a strange man. He had a workbench and little laboratory in his house, and he labored hard during the daytime so that he could afford a few hours every evening to work in his laboratory. He ground small lenses from pieces of glass; he mounted the lenses in tubes, and he used these gadgets to look at very small objects. The count was particularly fascinated by the tiny creatures that could be observed with the strong magnification, and which he had never seen before. He invited the man to move with his laboratory to the castle, to become a member of the count's household, and to devote henceforth all his time to the development and perfection of his optical gadgets as a special employee of the count.The townspeople, however, became angry when they realized that the count was wasting his money, as they thought, on a stunt without purpose. ""We are suffering from this plague,"" they said, ""while he is paying that man for a useless hobby!"" But the count remained firm. ""I give you as much as I can afford,"" he said, ""but I will also support this man and his work, because I know that someday something will come out of it!""Indeed, something very good came out of this work, and also out of similar work done by others at other places: the microscope. It is well known that the microscope has contributed more than any other invention to the progress of medicine, and that the elimination of the plague and many other contagious diseases from most parts of the world is largely a result of studies which the microscope made possible.The count, by retaining some of his spending money for research and discovery, contributed far more to the relief of human suffering than he could have contributed by giving all he could possibly spare to his plague-ridden community.The situation which we are facing today is similar in many respects. The President of the United States is spending about 200 billion dollars in his yearly budget. This money goes to health, education, welfare, urban renewal, highways, transportation, foreign aid, defense, conservation, science, agriculture and many installations inside and outside the country. About 1.6 percent of this national budget was allocated to space exploration this year. The space program includes Project Apollo, and many other smaller projects in space physics, space astronomy, space biology, planetary projects, Earth resources projects, and space engineering. To make this expenditure for the space program possible, the average American taxpayer with 10,000 dollars income per year is paying about 30 tax dollars for space. The rest of his income, 9,970 dollars, remains for his subsistence, his recreation, his savings, his other taxes, and all his other expenditures.You will probably ask now: ""Why don't you take 5 or 3 or 1 dollar out of the 30 space dollars which the average American taxpayer is paying, and send these dollars to the hungry children?"" To answer this question, I have to explain briefly how the economy of this country works. The situation is very similar in other countries. The government consists of a number of departments (Interior, Justice, Health, Education and Welfare, Transportation, Defense, and others) and the bureaus (National Science Foundation, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and others). All of them prepare their yearly budgets according to their assigned missions, and each of them must defend its budget against extremely severe screening by congressional committees, and against heavy pressure for economy from the Bureau of the Budget and the President. When the funds are finally appropriated by Congress, they can be spent only for the line items specified and approved in the budget.The budget of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, naturally, can contain only items directly related to aeronautics and space. If this budget were not approved by Congress, the funds proposed for it would not be available for something else; they would simply not be levied from the taxpayer, unless one of the other budgets had obtained approval for a specific increase which would then absorb the funds not spent for space. You realize from this brief discourse that support for hungry children, or rather a support in addition to what the United States is already contributing to this very worthy cause in the form of foreign aid, can be obtained only if the appropriate department submits a budget line item for this purpose, and if this line item is then approved by Congress.You may ask now whether I personally would be in favor of such a move by our government. My answer is an emphatic yes. Indeed, I would not mind at all if my annual taxes were increased by a number of dollars for the purpose of feeding hungry children, wherever they may live.I know that all of my friends feel the same way. However, we could not bring such a program to life merely by desisting from making plans for voyages to Mars. On the contrary, I even believe that by working for the space program I can make some contribution to the relief and eventual solution of such grave problems as poverty and hunger on Earth. Basic to the hunger problem are two functions: the production of food and the distribution of food. Food production by agriculture, cattle ranching, ocean fishing and other large-scale operations is efficient in some parts of the world, but drastically deficient in many others. For example, large areas of land could be utilized far better if efficient methods of watershed control, fertilizer use, weather forecasting, fertility assessment, plantation programming, field selection, planting habits, timing of cultivation, crop survey and harvest planning were applied.The best tool for the improvement of all these functions, undoubtedly, is the artificial Earth satellite. Circling the globe at a high altitude, it can screen wide areas of land within a short time; it can observe and measure a large variety of factors indicating the status and condition of crops, soil, droughts, rainfall, snow cover, etc., and it can radio this information to ground stations for appropriate use. It has been estimated that even a modest system of Earth satellites equipped with Earth resources, sensors, working within a program for worldwide agricultural improvements, will increase the yearly crops by an equivalent of many billions of dollars.The distribution of the food to the needy is a completely different problem. The question is not so much one of shipping volume, it is one of international cooperation. The ruler of a small nation may feel very uneasy about the prospect of having large quantities of food shipped into his country by a large nation, simply because he fears that along with the food there may also be an import of influence and foreign power. Efficient relief from hunger, I am afraid, will not come before the boundaries between nations have become less divisive than they are today. I do not believe that space flight will accomplish this miracle over night. However, the space program is certainly among the most promising and powerful agents working in this direction.Let me only remind you of the recent near-tragedy of Apollo 13. When the time of the crucial reentry of the astronauts approached, the Soviet Union discontinued all Russian radio transmissions in the frequency bands used by the Apollo Project in order to avoid any possible interference, and Russian ships stationed themselves in the Pacific and the Atlantic Oceans in case an emergency rescue would become necessary. Had the astronaut capsule touched down near a Russian ship, the Russians would undoubtedly have expended as much care and effort in their rescue as if Russian cosmonauts had returned from a space trip. If Russian space travelers should ever be in a similar emergency situation, Americans would do the same without any doubt.Higher food production through survey and assessment from orbit, and better food distribution through improved international relations, are only two examples of how profoundly the space program will impact life on Earth. I would like to quote two other examples: stimulation of technological development, and generation of scientific knowledge.The requirements for high precision and for extreme reliability which must be imposed upon the components of a moon-travelling spacecraft are entirely unprecedented in the history of engineering. The development of systems which meet these severe requirements has provided us a unique opportunity to find new material and methods, to invent better technical systems, to manufacturing procedures, to lengthen the lifetimes of instruments, and even to discover new laws of nature.All this newly acquired technical knowledge is also available for application to Earth-bound technologies. Every year, about a thousand technical innovations generated in the space program find their ways into our Earthly technology where they lead to better kitchen appliances and farm equipment, better sewing machines and radios, better ships and airplanes, better weather forecasting and storm warning, better communications, better medical instruments, better utensils and tools for everyday life. Presumably, you will ask now why we must develop first a life support system for our moon-travelling astronauts, before we can build a remote-reading sensor system for heart patients. The answer is simple: significant progress in the solutions of technical problems is frequently made not by a direct approach, but by first setting a goal of high challenge which offers a strong motivation for innovative work, which fires the imagination and spurs men to expend their best efforts, and which acts as a catalyst by including chains of other reactions.Spaceflight without any doubt is playing exactly this role. The voyage to Mars will certainly not be a direct source of food for the hungry. However, it will lead to so many new technologies and capabilities that the spin-offs from this project alone will be worth many times the cost of its implementation.Besides the need for new technologies, there is a continuing great need for new basic knowledge in the sciences if we wish to improve the conditions of human life on Earth. We need more knowledge in physics and chemistry, in biology and physiology, and very particularly in medicine to cope with all these problems which threaten man's life: hunger, disease, contamination of food and water, pollution of the environment.We need more young men and women who choose science as a career and we need better support for those scientists who have the talent and the determination to engage in fruitful research work. Challenging research objectives must be available, and sufficient support for research projects must be provided. Again, the space program with its wonderful opportunities to engage in truly magnificent research studies of moons and planets, of physics and astronomy, of biology and medicine is an almost ideal catalyst which induces the reaction between the motivation for scientific work, opportunities to observe exciting phenomena of nature, and material support needed to carry out the research effort.Among all the activities which are directed, controlled, and funded by the American government, the space program is certainly the most visible and probably the most debated activity, although it consumes only 1.6 percent of the total national budget, and 3 per mille (less than one-third of 1 percent) of the gross national product. As a stimulant and catalyst for the development of new technologies, and for research in the basic sciences, it is unparalleled by any other activity. In this respect, we may even say that the space program is taking over a function which for three or four thousand years has been the sad prerogative of wars.How much human suffering can be avoided if nations, instead of competing with their bomb-dropping fleets of airplanes and rockets, compete with their moon-travelling space ships! This competition is full of promise for brilliant victories, but it leaves no room for the bitter fate of the vanquished, which breeds nothing but revenge and new wars.Although our space program seems to lead us away from our Earth and out toward the moon, the sun, the planets, and the stars, I believe that none of these celestial objects will find as much attention and study by space scientists as our Earth. It will become a better Earth, not only because of all the new technological and scientific knowledge which we will apply to the betterment of life, but also because we are developing a far deeper appreciation of our Earth, of life, and of man.The photograph which I enclose with this letter shows a view of our Earth as seen from Apollo 8 when it orbited the moon at Christmas, 1968. Of all the many wonderful results of the space program so far, this picture may be the most important one. It opened our eyes to the fact that our Earth is a beautiful and most precious island in an unlimited void, and that there is no other place for us to live but the thin surface layer of our planet, bordered by the bleak nothingness of space. Never before did so many people recognize how limited our Earth really is, and how perilous it would be to tamper with its ecological balance. Ever since this picture was first published, voices have become louder and louder warning of the grave problems that confront man in our times: pollution, hunger, poverty, urban living, food production, water control, overpopulation. It is certainly not by accident that we begin to see the tremendous tasks waiting for us at a time when the young space age has provided us the first good look at our own planet.Very fortunately though, the space age not only holds out a mirror in which we can see ourselves, it also provides us with the technologies, the challenge, the motivation, and even with the optimism to attack these tasks with confidence. What we learn in our space program, I believe, is fully supporting what Albert Schweitzer had in mind when he said: ""I am looking at the future with concern, but with good hope.""My very best wishes will always be with you, and with your children.Very sincerely yours,Ernst StuhlingerAssociate Director for Science",UNKNOWN,Robert Frost,1.7K,9.4K,195.4M,https://www.quora.com/How-can-we-use-a-computer-in-space-exploration

I never see SF movies portraying space travel that way, even though so many SF books and short stories do. David Weber does a great job of getting the math right and expressing it accurately in his space battles: if two groups of warships are coming at each other at high speed for some reason, each tactical team loads their instructions into their computers and waits tensely (sometimes for hours) until the moment of engagement— which lasts milliseconds, because their relative velocities are crazy high— and then you've got two clouds of wreckage moving away from one another at that same terrific speed, while the humans bustle madly to do damage control & triage before either of them can be engaged again.If that kind of meteoric-speed jousting is not what one of the commanders wants, their ships will be decelerating madly to try to widen that engagement-window; the opposing side of course probably has a reason to keep it as short as possible, so they’ll be burning fuel like mad trying to minimize the possible time of engagement. And space is enormous: an actual spaceship battle would begin like a week's-long chess game, shift to an hour or so of sniper fire, and then maybe ten seconds of furious knife-fighting (metaphorically speaking) and then someone will have won. Or both will have lost!I guess that doesn't translate well to the screen though.",15 followers,Mike Miller,824,10.7K,51M,https://www.quora.com/How-can-we-use-a-computer-in-space-exploration

They should've known they were on hallowed ground right there. No, they had to spit in the face of all the aging geeks out there who followed the Apollo program as kids. The writers couldn't be bothered to check the simple fact that in the Apollo Lunar Excursion Module (LEM) the descent system was completely isolated from the ascent system. So they had Ray Palmer reporting that his landing in the LEM took too much fuel so he couldn't get back to orbit.That is just plain lazy.How hard is it to check Wikipedia?",UNKNOWN,Eric M.

The nearest star to the Sun (Proxima Centauri) is 4.24 light years away. Considering that the Sun is just 8 light-MINUTES away from us, it’s definitely not in our back yard, and the trip would take quite a while. With the tech we have right now, it would be about 55,000 (!) years, give or take. Most other stars in the Milky Way are substantially farther away, given that its diameter is about 100,000 light-years. However, there are 59 stellar systems within 20 light years of the Sun, so it’s not all bad.2) As I understand, there are multiple viable concepts of engines that can be used for interstellar travel. That is, they might be able to accelerate the ship sufficiently (e.g. to 5 or even 10% of the speed of light) to make interstellar flights realistic. However, there’s no possible way to pack a sufficient amount of energy inside the spacecraft, let alone to do it safely. It’s totally impossible with today’s technology. For example, even if we have hundreds of tons of antimatter as a fuel, how exactly are we going to store it in the starship, or transport it safely into the proper part of the engine to react?But imagine that we are able to reach the proper speed (like 20 percent the speed of light). The problem is, interstellar space is not exactly empty. At that speed, even individual atoms can damage the vehicle and cause significant local heating, and a collision with a bit of dust as small as 15–20 micrometers across would be catastrophic for the spacecraft. Thankfully particles like that are very rare in the interstellar space.3) Leaving Earth is still very difficult and prohibitively expensive, especially if the load is massive enough. Some fancy intererstellar engine can possibly accelerate the spacecraft in vacuum, but escaping Earth’s gravity requires very powerful thrust, which means huge (and dangerous) old-fashioned rockets. If the spacecraft itself is very large… well, you get the picture. It‘d only be possible to assemble in orbit, which is a feat on its own.Still, I believe that interstellar travel will become technically feasible before too long. The question is: how practical it’s going to be? Especially sending people there. One-way trip just for the hell of it doesn’t sound all that tempting.

This has to be done in absolute secrecy: people meeting personally and talking face to face. No electronic communications, no political independence movements, no graffitis and no propaganda.

As the title for this little answer states, speed kills.​It's a real thing that we already have, as I've outlined inThe first weaponized railgun planned for production, theIf we apply similar mechanics as what we used to figure outCurrently, rail guns are being considered for roles that don't include anti-personnel operations, i.e. no one wants to shoot at any individual with them. They are being researched to be able to take down ballistic missiles, which travel at extreme speeds, as well as new generations of hypersonic weapons platforms estimated to one day soon reaching Mach 20 or fast enough to get from Beijing to LA in about three minutes. That's just insane. Still, with little variation, I could see this being our best first defense if somehow we knew that an alien armada were on their way to our front door.I'm no expert on orbital mechanics, but I am sure we could produce a weapon such that we could accurately point the thing up at such a direction that it will be affected by gravity and what minimal effects of air resistance to reach its target at some point in the future. Once the burly chains of Earth's gravity, the projectile can travel, unabated through empty space, practically forever. I've never seen this concept articulated better than in a conversation between a couple of NPC's in the background of the Mass Effect 2.Gunnery ChiefWhat a terrible world we live in where that conversation become relevant. That said, I would rather attempt to fight off our alien invaders well beyond the range of Pluto. A railgun is the only weapon that would make this feasible. Of course, the railguns we currently have aren't going to do much good for mainly one reason; they are too slow. I know the Boeing's Phantom Works clocked in at around a mile per second, but if we assume that the projectile suffers no loss from atmospheric or gravitational forces, and that we planned to intercept our target around Saturn, it would take 23 years to reach it. That's obviously too slow being that we have only 10 years to implement a plan and negate the threat.So we are going to have to get the thing faster. Speed also gives us another advantage that we will need if our enemy flew ninety billion light years just to pick a fight; reaction time. It's likely that anything moving for twenty three years might get discovered in that time and, like the Millennium Falcon dodging every attack ever made against it, slowly listing to the left will take care of it. The closer we move this weapon towards lightspeed, the more effective it will become, sure, but also the less time the enemy will have to react to it. Consider this, at normal speeds of weapons we are dealing with, the speed of light doesn't really matter, however, if you were to increase the speed of an object to half the speed of light it gets very difficult for the prey to do anything about it. Consider this, you have your .5 lightspeed bullet aiming in at a target two light years away. It will take them two years to detect that this launch has even happened, but by that point, the projectile has already moved a full light year, or half way to them. Yes, they still have a full year to do something about it. Still, that may not be a lot time being that they will have to move out its way. Being that they are probably moving on the order of insanely fast as well, their time to react is cut as well, and being that they are (probably) some massive space ship and not a tiny space bullet, will probably require vast amounts of energy itself just to dodge the thing.That's not bad, but if we fire that same weapon in the neighborhood of the Solar System our chances of hitting the thing get even better. Moving at the speed of light, it could take a message from Earth about four minutes sixteen seconds to reach Mars, depending on orbit. That means that our little intruders would have to react to an incoming projectile moving at .5 lightspeed with only two minutes and eight seconds to spare. I have no idea how hard it is to pilot an alien space ship, but I just have to assume that is a hard thing to do, given their mass and acceleration, you know, since they flew across the galaxy and probably have enough Mountain Dews and fruit roll ups to make it back home, as well.There is a lot of math that goes into this that I am not going to subject myself to figuring out for a question like this, but you can. The key factors are that we have to have enough power to energize the device, and you have to make it big enough. Yeah, that is really it. If it is big enough and has enough power, you can launch anything just about as fast as you want. This system really is the ultimate metaphor for male inferiority. Of course, it's important to note that the energy required to move something that fast increases exponentially to the point that accelerating even something as small as an atom approaches an infinite amount energy. I don't know where we will get an infinite amount of energy and even something moving at .2 lightspeed requires many more times the energy of something moving at .1 lightspeed. Just sayin'. That could be a problem.As far as technical schematics... I don't have those, but I can say that there are some things we think about in design. If we are really focused on maximizing the threat of this medium, we need to think about how to eliminating all forces which might counteract its effectiveness. I've mentioned this already, air resistance and the effects of gravity. Where can we fire a weapon that we won't have to deal with problems like air or gravity?​Space. Ah yes, the final firing range. I'm just going to be up front, we need to stick a giant cannon in space because aliens.Just sticking it in space, however, won't work. Newton really messed us over with a few things. In this case, another little meditation of his says something equal and opposite forces. If we are pushing something out with an equivalent amount of energy to an atomic weapon, we are also pushing the weapon back that much, as well. I don't think little thrusters pushing out ounces of air to stabilize the dinky little satellite are going to do much good. That's essentially a one shot weapon which then becomes a massive destructive event in and of itself. That's a bad idea. So where can we stick this thing that won't be constrained by the amount of energy we put into it?​Yep. I want to put a massive gun on the moon, once again, because aliens. On the surface of the moon we can build all the necessary technogizitry required; the giant cannon, the massive power supply, as well as all the aiming devices. So now we have our giant space gun. From here, we need to wait for a time when it is in the range we need and at a timing that we can deal with.All that said, in writing the original answer I stumbled on images of giant guns on the moon and was reminded of Dr. Evil's ""Death Star"", which got me thinking... oh yeah, lasers would also work. Seriously.This is called the Laser Weapons System (LaWS). It has a generic name, but a cool acronym, so the military funded it.​TheThe LaWS is a ship-defense system that has so far publicly engaged anThe LaWS is designed to be used against low-end asymmetric threats. Scalable power levels allow it to be used on low-power to dazzle a person's eye to non-lethally make them turn away from a threatening posture, and increase to 30 thousand watts (30 kW) to fry sensors, burn out motors, and detonate explosive materials. Against a vital point on small UAVs, one can be shot down in as little as two seconds. When facing small boats, the laser would target a craft's motor to disable it and make it ""dead in the water,"" then repeating this against others in rapid succession, requiring only a few seconds of firing per boat. Targeting the platform is more effective than individual crewmembers, although the LaWS is accurate enough to target explosive rockets if on board, whose detonations could kill the operators. Against larger aircraft like helicopters, it is able to burn through some vital components, which would cause it to fall and crash.We actually already have this one, as well. Yea, Earth. Way to be prepared. The system has already been in use and deployed for test purposes shooting down drones. When our last answer was talking about objects moving at near lightspeed, well, a drone just isn't that fast. The way it works, simply put, is that you aim it at one very vital point and just follow that point long enough to bore a hole through whatever you are aiming out. Then you end up damaging whatever it is until it dies. Given that this too already exists, we have a starting platform to get this ball rolling.A major constraint of all weaponized lasers, though, is the power-killing effects of refraction in the Earth's atmosphere. Yeah it doesn't do very much over a short distance, but a few atoms of nitrogen in the sky have the ability to bend the light beam just enough that, several million miles away, it is basically just a pretty glow. To handle this problem... we are still going to need to build it in space. Giant space lasers. Awesome.Since there really isn't that much Newtonian blowback from a beam of light, and since the power requirements and size aren't as vast as the moon based railgun idea, we can actually build these as satellites floating around in high orbit. Yes, I did sayOur aliens would be suffering the same problem they did with the railgun scenario only with laser weapons, there is literally no warning. The moment that the light could be seen leaving earth, it's also impacting the hull of the ship. Hopefully, if all thousand of our space lasers are aiming at the same place on the ship, we could beam a hole right through it in a few seconds. I'm sure that they could have sealing mechanisms to prevent catastrophic decompression, but still, I am pretty sure that getting laser beamed for several million miles can't be something that just any ship could withstand forever.Actually, yeah, the lasers are a better option, and given the amount of knowledge we already have about putting things into space and building these weapons on Earth, I would say that the lasers are the better way to go. That isn't to say that the moon gun isn't a workable solution, but in only 10 years... lasers. Both of these ideas rely on the aliens not having some super advanced system beyond our imagination that could defeat both projectile kinetic weapons and laser weapons, you know like green shields. In that event, I've prepared a third schematic of what to do.​That was fun, but let's get real for a second. We are a species that still has trouble managing our own finances and the ability to blow itself up, though we have done alright for the last seventy years. We have created things like the Darwin Awards and presidential executive order because we, as a people, just realize that once you put us all together, we are just pretty dumb and don't trust one another. Sure, there are some truly brilliant individuals out there who are just worlds beyond this sort of primate behavior, but what good are they really?Neil DeGrasse Tyson sums it up nicely. Basically, he wonders if we as a species are just too stupid to solve many of the universe's problems when he considers that the difference between humanity and our nearest relative, the chimp, is about a one percent difference in DNA. Imagine if you had a hypothetical war between chimps and humans (and the chimps didn't get to have any sort of special brain juice). Do you really think they would stand a chance? Do you really imagine the brightest chimps in the world being able to mount a realistic defense against even an army of our dumbest humans? Imagine the odds of this one. Consider this in terms of our aliens. Humanity built the most beautiful works of art, such the Statue of David, the most advanced mechanisms of science, like the Hubble Telescope, and have given birth to the most grand ideas such as democracy and honey barbeque sauce.​The reason the chimps didn't do all this because the sum total difference we have between just that 1% difference between we and they. Now consider this, what feats are capable of a species only 1% different from us in the same way as we are to the chimps? When you consider what is currently being funded and planned by the US military for use twenty years from now, the subject ofMaybe their star was born much sooner than ours, or their evolutionary track was faster than ours, but the odds that we will even be close on the technological tree of progression (like every Star Trek episode ever made) are astronomically small. Now consider that you have a species which has solved the problems of stellar travel. They've reached a point where crossing the interstellar void isn't a problem for them. That's a big problem which our greatest scientists and millions of laymen researchers and space fanboys have been seeking to solve for hundreds of years. The closest we've got is a hunk of metal that won't reach another star for thousands of years. Considering that our enemy has already solved this problem leaves me thinking, realistically, that the aliens have solved far, far more than we can account for in ten years. Realistically, they've probably solved more than we could account for in ten million years. That's a scary thought to me because if, as this question asks, an enemy alien race wanted to annihilate us, they wouldn't be our enemy - they would be our fate.Thanks for reading!For more answers like this check out",614 followers,Tim Rivett,10.8K,345,3.1M,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-things-that-bother-you-about-space-travel-in-Sci-fi

We can barely get space probes out into space let alone weapons to fight an interstellar war.Delta IV HeavyThe Space Launch SystemLasers require massive energy sources that would be extremely heavy and might take take many missions per laser that need to be assembled on site in orbit.The Aliens.Our aliens would have proven technology that is at least 50 to 100 years ahead of ours (probably far more) that has been well tested and is reliable enough to spend possibly centuries in space to get here. As they get closer they are getting more and more intelligence on us. They will be listening to our radio, news and TV broadcasts and might be able to decipher some of what is going on. The news, being ever helpful, will probably have daily broadcasts about the scary aliens and the rockets and weapons we are building to destroy them. Forget the element of surprise. There is no way our incompetent governments can keep everything a secret for 10 years.So we have to assume the aliens already have far superior propulsion technology and far more advanced technology in general. They have almost unlimited options for weapons to use against us. They could adapt some of their rockets to throw asteroids at us or even send a missile that breaks into a cluster of hundreds of smaller missile pods long before arriving with poisons that will rain down on us from space. They could already have a small fleet of laser drones ready to fire or even nuclear pumped, focused gamma ray weapons and EMP weapons. Technologies we have barely conceived of. They may have weapons we never even imagined.See:What can we do?There are not a lot of options but there are some and they are (almost) all bad to both parties.. These are easy to deploy options in 10 years or less. With all respect to my good friendOption 1Isolation and buying more time.Even an advanced space faring society would find it impossible to enter orbit and land on our planet. The process of descent would destroy any craft. Instead of one debris cloud our entire orbit would be like the movie with super fast debris from every direction. This would also wipe out our entire modern society and satellite communication. At least we could be sure the aliens would not be able to land and maybe they go to Mars and wait for the decades to centuries long process it would take for the debris to subside. During that time, both sides can work on more weapons.Option 2Dead HandNuclear weapons are not feasible as a weapon against the aliens as they can track and destroy the missiles in flight long before they become a threat. But they can serve as a deterrent. How you might ask?We threaten to blow it all up. Russia developed (and supposedly still has) a system calledAn example of fail-deadly deterrence, it can automatically trigger the launch of the Russian intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) if a nuclear strike is detected by seismic, light, radioactivity and overpressure sensors.We devise hundreds of nuclear weapons that are purposely clad in outer shells of highly radioactive materials and radioactive waste from reactors. These need not even be launched they could be put on subs, boats, nuclear power plants and installed on land. When the nuclear weapon goes off the nuclear fallout is magnified by tons of radioactive materials surrounding the bomb. This propels the materials into the atmosphere and with even 10% of these successfully going off we turn the entire Earth into a wasteland that is so contaminated by radiation that no creature can live on the surface.We broadcast this to the aliens directly using simple pictures made of binary transmissions on multiple wavelengths. Option 1 and 2 can be deployed simultaneously.Option 3Talk.Now that we have proven we can make the Earth useless to the aliens we force them to the negotiation tables and try to work out a peaceful solution. Likely any society that has mastered space travel will have successfully survived the nuclear era of development and will understand the concepts of deterrence and mutual destruction. From here we can work out a positive solution for both sides and we can still keep our deterrents active and ready to be used.","7,489 followers",Chris Bast,9.1K,12.7K,41M,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-things-that-bother-you-about-space-travel-in-Sci-fi

Really big. You just won't believe how vastly, hugely, mind-bogglingly big it is. I mean, you may think your 110-year-old grandfather lived a long life, but that's just peanuts to time.”Life and intelligent life may be so rare in our microscopic time scale that it never exists in more than one place at the same time and there may be immense stretches of time (by our perception) when there is no life, anywhere. But in the time scale of the universe, intelligent life may be very common. Just not as we perceive things in our minuscule time scale. Both things may be true at the same time.Modern humans have been around what, 100,000 years? Yet that’s just one-billionth of the expected lifespan of the universe and just 1/138,000th of the time the universe has existed so far. We exist at a very tiny scale, both in terms of time and distance.Just 10 billion years after the universe started, we know life evolved on Earth. But the Earth has had intelligent life for just the past 1/30,000th of its existence. For aliens to find us, they would have to exist in the same teeny blip of time we occupy.

The total age of the Universe as far as active burning stars is concerned is about 100 Trillion years(UK). That means that at this point in time, we are about 0.0000000001% of the way through the Universe. That's so close to the beginning of the Universe that we are still able to detect the heat from the big band itself. We call it the Microwave background radiation. Think about it, we live during the Big Bang, at least as far as future civilizations would be concerned. So we are very early. Not enough time has elapsed since the start of the Universe for many civilizations to reach an advanced stage.Nucleosynthesis is the method the universe uses to create the heavier elements. The Big Bang produced Hydrogen, Helium and Deuterium. that's it. The heavier elements we take for granted, and what’s required to produce planets like Earths and Life as we can conceive it, are “cooked” in stars. The first generation of stars we entirely made from Hydrogen and were slightly different to the stars we know today. when they exploded as Supernovae they enriched the interstellar medium with Carbon, Nitrogen, Iron and many other elements. The second generation of stars helped increase the percentage of heavier elements to allow for the creation of the planets as we know them. When we look at the extrasolar planets and the ones in the Solar System, we find they are mostly Gas Giants. Exactly what you would expect to find when most of the Universe is still made up of the lightest element Hydrogen and Helium at over 98%. Life must be made from matter and only 2 atom can produce complex chemistry, Carbon and Silicon. It’s logical to assume that life would either be based on Silicon or Carbon. Life on Earth uses Carbon and we know that Water is an essential ingredient for that type of life. That will limit the number of Planets that could produce Carbon Based life. The future of the Universe will be more prosperous for planetary production as the % of those heavier elements will increase over time.It took life about 800 million years to start on Earth after its formation. Pretty quick in astronomical terms. Life started as simple single celled organisms and essentially stayed that way for over 3 Billion Years. It’s only the last 650 Million Years that life has blossomed on the Planet. The Cambrian Explosion now appears to have occurred due to the Oxygen level in the atmosphere and oceans reaching a saturation point. Whatever the cause, Life exploded out of the Oceans and onto land and after 650 million years it reached a point where an intelligent species evolved. Put another way we as a species have been on Earth for a little over 0.000014% of the planets existence. We can consider the Earth to be an average rocky planet. We orbit an average star, which is located in a rather boring spot in a fairly average spiral galaxy in a sedate part of the Universe. As an average planet we can conclude fairly safely that life occurred in an average way on the Earth as well. If this is true then the emergence of Intelligence like ours is quite rare due to the low percentage above.Two Astronomically small numbers, the Amount of time elapsed since the big bang as a whole and the amount of time it took for our arrival on the planet doesn't give much hope for other civilizations to have occurred anywhere close to us. I have no doubt that there are other civilizations in the Universe but it is so vast, and time so long, that it’s highly unlikely that there is another civilization with our level of technology within the Local Group. And if they are not in the Local Group we will NEVER know they anything about them.Science fiction is full of ancient civilizations that discovered the secrets of the Universe and left their knowledge for future civilizations. The Time Lords, the Ionians, the Ancients, the Kiint and others represent this theme. We are the actual ancient race, we live in a time where we can discover not only the Laws of Physics but we can directly observe the effects of the Big Bang in the expansion of the Universe, the Microwave Background radiation and the percentage of elements in the Universe. In the future none of these things will be detectable. The Universe will have expanded so far that even individual Galaxies will be separated from each other completely. The M.B.R. will eventually cool beyond detection. By this stage in the Universe it would be IMPOSSIBLE to conclude the existence of the big bang, the Universe will consist of the galaxy in which the civilization arose as no other galaxy would be observable.

35,"Bruce and tony both are known for their prep. They both have fought enemies who were more powered than them.Let's assume a week is given as prep time to both of them.Tony would rather chill for two days at hotel drinking vintage wine surrounded by girls and all. Jarvis at the same time would gather information on batman and all his arsenal.Meanwhile batman would gather information much faster on iron man as tony is publicly know as iron man and batman won't have to do investigation on that. He would get his best armour up and running. Ready for the fight he is going to have.Now keep in mind toBruce and tony both are known for their prep.

Now the final day has arrived, tony knows today batman will show up but he doesn't know where and when.Tony would use bleeding edge armourAnd batman would use insider armourThe fight:Now while tony is chilling around out of nowhere batman crashes in and delevers a blow. The shot did nothing to tony. They both are standing next to each other​ face to face. And tony would fire a repulser and Batman would dodge it and go invisible. But iron man has all different kinds of scanner and in seconds he tracks batman and blasts him of the fight would go on and on as powerful as Inside is (it has power similar to each jla member) it is limited to use each power only once before recharge. And recharge time varies between different powers. On the other hand tony's armour could go on and on without needing to recharge.Now for people who would be saying insider is like all jla member in one. Nope its not the original powers it's a copy of them. And also weaker armours of tony has tanked nukes at 4% battery​. Also i find majority of feats of batman as Cis and Pis. Now how would a normal human take a punch from superman and live without any armour?So in the end ironman would be standing ontop of dead batman. He would then take insider armour and reverse engineer it to create an even more powerful armour.","4,991 followers",Darcy Cristaudo,586,5.7K,45.6M,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-things-that-bother-you-about-space-travel-in-Sci-fi
36,"This is actually a great question as it nearly perfectly exemplifies the differences between Marvel and DC. Batman can prep to defeat anybody and everyone because of one massive difference between the worlds of Marvel and DC, realism.Marvel and DC are both companies that sell escapist products about characters who have powers that make no sense at all, in galaxies with alien races that make no sense at all, with tech that makes no sense at all, this is not where the differences in realism appear, in fact, in recent years I would say DC is actually more realistic in this respect what with the tThis is actually a great question as it nearly perfectly exemplifies the differences between Marvel and DC. Batman can prep to defeat anybody and everyone because of one massive difference between the worlds of Marvel and DC, realism.Marvel and DC are both companies that sell escapist products about characters who have powers that make no sense at all, in galaxies with alien races that make no sense at all, with tech that makes no sense at all, this is not where the differences in realism appear, in fact, in recent years I would say DC is actually more realistic in this respect what with the ten realms, multiple intergalactic empires, Ultron bonding with Hank Pym etc.The differences occur on a smaller scale, be it with the way the world reacts to superheroes, mutants, and galactic conflict, or with the way plans go. When Batman makes a plan, nothing goes wrong, all the variables change nothing and everything fits in place in the end (this is a general rule). It’s much like watching a mission impossible movie, when the mask comes off, everything falls into place…. until you look at it too closely. When you read into many of Batman’s plans, there’s a bit of plot armor involved. This is not a problem with the character, it’s just a style of writing, not better or worse.The above image is a badass moment that would never happen in the marvel universe, for better or worse. It’s different when Iron Man fights with prep. Simply put, EVERYTHING GOES WRONG. The variables he doesn’t account for screw him over, for example, he has a suit for fighting Thor, but when he fights Thor, he’s fighting a much more powerful version he doesn't have data on, the Odin force Thor, the Phoenix Buster takes the Phoenix out, but also splits it into 5 pieces, making the problem worse. It goes on, he fights the Hulk, a character he has defeated without prep before, but now--the Hulk is angrier, more powerful, or simply the Green Scar.To be fair though, in the fight above he may have won if it wasn’t for some pilots enraging the Hulk more, yet another variable gone wrong.The bottom line is, when Batman makes a plan, everything that can go right, generally does, even if there are hiccups along the way, Iron Man on the other hand suffers from his enemies not acting predictably, or the power levels of his opponents changing.Many have wondered why Iron Man makes suits to counter other beings just barely powerful enough to do so, this is also another major difference between the two characters. Iron Man holds himself back, as recently shown in his 2018 run, Iron Man purposely doesn’t make the most powerful suits he could because he doesn’t trust himself, but when forced to “Pull out all the Stops” and make the best suit he can, he becomes so powerful that he curb-stomps a character that had just been crushing the champions, Wasp, and War Machine.So, in conclusion, Iron Man doesn’t have the reputation for prep time not because of the character he is, but because of the universe he’s in. Regardless of what you prefer, there are undeniable differences between the Marvel and DC universes, and this comparison shows that well.",6 followers,William Sullivan,1.5K,107,323.6K,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-things-that-bother-you-about-space-travel-in-Sci-fi
