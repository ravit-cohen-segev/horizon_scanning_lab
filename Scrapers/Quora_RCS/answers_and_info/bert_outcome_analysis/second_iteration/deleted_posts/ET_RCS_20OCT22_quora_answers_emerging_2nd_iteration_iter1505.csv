Compared to western research institutes, Chinese research institutes, including military development and research, use a method which is called in Chinese 小步快跑 which means “rapid development in small steps”.This means that a Chinese research institute is likely to test a technology quickly and in a less than perfect way just to see if it works. It may be integrated into a larger system to gather feedback, and that feedback will be used to develop the next generation.Instead of seeking perfection, the goal is to gather feedback in a quick and timely fashion for the next generation.This has happened most noticeably now in the development and introduction of new military technologies such as aircraft carriers, and in Chinese high-speed train engineering [1] technology. The Chinese PLAN’s Type 055 class destroyer was first introduced in 2005 and, at the time, it did not really impress Western military analysts. Over the years though, it has improved to the point where most agree that it is superior to the US Navy’s Arleigh Burke class of destroyers. This pace of development also applies to stealth fighters, where the Chinese J-20 and J-31 have iterated at a faster pace than the US’s F-35. The Chinese have been weaker in jet engine technology, but they are working hard to catch up with the US. When the new Chinese engines come out, the Chinese stealth fighters will be retro-fitted with them.What makes China difficult to compete with for the US is that China’s annual defense budget is 1% of annual GDP, while the US’s annual defense budget is 4–5%. So, the Chinese are much more efficient with their development...",430 followers,Lim Giok Beng,566,6.8K,1.4M,https://www.quora.com/How-can-I-learn-about-marketing-in-2020
7,"Let me start with the similarities.At the ground level you have a researcher group which has about a dozen researchers and is led by a research scientist or professor. The researchers are scientists, post docs, and graduate students that do the research. Each research group works with other groups and share facilities.In Europe a lot of research is done organized at the European level through international collaborations such as CERN.

The researchers are scientists, post docs, and graduate students that do the research. Each research group works with other groups and share facilities.In Europe a lot of research is done organized at the European level through international collaborations such as CERN. The US organizes research through universities and national labs which are usually funded by the Federal government but operated by university consortium or by the Department of Energy. Research is also funded by agencies such as the National Science Foundation.In China, the funding is far more decentralized, with much of the funding done by local governments. Also rather than having a system of national labs, much research is done by the Chinese Academy of Science, which is completely different from the US National Academy of Science. The US organization is an honorary society that does some policy while the Chinese Academy is this huge research organization. Also US universities often have huge endowments which can be used to fund research whereas Chinese universities don’t. A lot of applied research is done by corporations such as Microsoft or Huawei. The one difference I can see is the Chinese local governments are more active at creating science and innovation hubs than US local governments.Finally the big difference us the role of the Communist Party. China copied the Soviet system in the universities and research institutions are administered at the top level by the Party Committee, so you have a Party Secretary along with the instituional head and senior administrators are invariably party members. At the top level these groups link the scientists and the politicians. In the US you obviously dont have that system and the link between the scientists and politicians is done through professional societies, and advisory groups such as the DOE P5 committee and the Snowmass process. In Hong Kong there isnt a policy system. Hong Kong is part of national science policy but pooicy mediation seems to be done informally between local scientists and mainland research collaborations, and the communications is quite fragmented and things are improving.The other thing is that the US system was developed in the 1950s and there is nothing that suggests it will change. China is still trying to put together its system, and putting together a system for big science and figuring out how to do international collaborations is still something to be done. Im trying to pull as much of this through Hong Kong as possible which is explains why I know what I know about local Hong Kong politics. What is interesting is that the HKSAR has no science policy ( it has barely a technology policy) and figuring out how the SAR governmemt should do with basic science if anything is why I got pulled into Legco politics.One issue with Hong Kong is that traditional British colonial policy wss to silo different segments if society which means that you dont have the business-science linkages that you would in Silicon Valley although things have gotten a lot better. As an example of the problem you have software at Cyberport, hardware at Science Park, and design at Innocentre. This is great on an org chart, but what happens if you need to do hardware, software, and design.I also have a toe in Taiwanese basic research but talking about that gets too depressing. Too many universities. Too few students. Too much politics. No viable long term vision.One other data point is Japan. When it comes to how the Japanese organize research and development, it turns out to be incredibly well organized and they are just absolutely excellent at government-business-science collaboration and public outreach. If you draw an org chart of Japanese research organizations you get this nice neat org chart. If you try to do this with China you get a spaghetti diagram.The big problem for Japan is that they are a mature economy with not much new money coming in.",1 follower,Dahyun Kim,20.7K,218,8M,https://www.quora.com/How-can-I-learn-about-marketing-in-2020

These are simply my observations.The biggest difference I discovered between the two, at a fundamental level is their priorities.China is Outcome-DrivenTo put it very bluntly,This is why it is extremely important in Chinese culture to have your own house and car to show people that you have wealth. You’ve made it. How you attain that wealth is not really important or up for discussion, as long as you reach that status or checkmark. Life is brutal and unforgiving. It is a culture where they respect power and money more than anything else.Chinese are also more productive and industrious at the business level. There is less red tape or regulations to deal with soSince Chinese culture focuses on results, people tend to be more successful in life. They are good at “obtaining” things like permits, quotas, meeting deadlines or requirements, etc.The West is System-DrivenWhile China is an outcome-driven culture, the west is a system-driven one. The outcome is important, but what’s more important in western culture is theThat is why in the west it’s taboo to ask someone how much he/she makes. What’s more important is what the person does for a living.In business, the Chinese will focus on reducing costs and increasing efficiency while Westerners, especially Europeans, will care more about how that product is made and provide valuable experiences with that product.To illustrate this let’s look at watches. TheIn western culture feelings or experiences are importantLiving in Asia I noticed how westerners are just wired differently from East Asians. They will have tons of small talk even at work, talking about the news or some difficulties they encountered on their way to work that day, trivial affairs that are never really the topic of conversation among the Chinese. For the Chinese, they made it to work on time, there’s nothing more to say on the matter.Since western culture focuses on theWesterners also tend to beTo sum up the global economy today:Collectivism vs IndividualismThe second biggest difference between China and the west is that the former is a collectivist or conformist society, while the latter is an individualistic society.China as a whole is much more unified and centralized than the west.The West is more individualistic and this is reflected in the political landscape.For example, Scotland has its own separate unique identity that is different from the UK or Europe. And Scotland is a country of only about 5 million people. Many medium-sized cities in China have more people than the entire country of Scotland. The same goes for regions like Wales, Northern Ireland, Cornwall, Andalucia, Catalunya, Bavaria, Veneto, Flanders, etc.Thanks for reading***If you found this answer insightful, please be kind enough to like and share.

This course is moreWorking professionals with 4-6 years of experienceLearning data science as a course has become really a good option for people who want to move into IT. Well, it is not something that only freshers or novices can do. This course is moreWorking professionals with 4-6 years of experienceWith increasing demand and continuous advancement to this technology, you might feel to enroll in some post-graduation courses from colleges or universities. Well, I can guide you all along on how to start with this course.From my personal experience and knowledge, I can suggest to you how to get started with the Data Science course. Firstly you need to lay a strong foundation of your basics right.Now, once your foundation is strong, you have an idea of Data Science as a course. Now to enter the Data Science market, you need to have practical experience in it. It is not a course where you can enter without any practicality. Reasons why it is not meant for a fresher:1. A working professional, who has some experience working in SQL or coding as a Software developer, will be in a better place to understand the depth of this course as he/she already has some experience in any significant role compared to a novice who hasn’t worked at all on any project.2. It requires good hands-on experience on coding tools and deployments like running builds or pipelines to create end-to-end flow or creating pipelines from scratch or pushing code to Github. Experience on these platforms is required.3. Someone who has already worked in the IT field, especially in a System engineer or Analyst role, might know the data in and out to understand the business. A novice might not know business data and its meaning in different sectors like Retail, Healthcare, etc.One more point is that the competition has tremendously increased over the past few years.Hence, you are as a beginner might need to work extra hard. You need to search for contentonline. Also, there will be times when you have content but toward the end of that free tutorial you might feel it was not worth it and you didn’t gain much knowledge.Extensive knowledge in this field:As you might need extensive knowledge of Data Science as a subject, I would suggest you go to some experts. For sure there are many institutes like IITs and IIIT’s in this field. But rather than paying some heavy amount for PG programs, it’s better to learn from the local institute you have in Chennai. Most of them give you hands-on experience and have online batches running right now.They understand that we are in the middle of pandemics but the learning cannot be stopped. Hence, they have started online batches, where you can enroll either in weekend batch or weekday batches based on your learnings. I can recommend few institutes in Chennai which you can refer to if you want:1- LearnBay :Program Name 1: Python TrainingProgram Name 2: Data Science course for Manager and Leaders, Freshers and Working ProfessionalsWhy should you prefer: Good Quality learning2- Great Learning Institute:Program Name 1: PGP Program in Data Science & EngineeringProgram Name 2: M.Tech - Data Science and Machine LearningWhy should you prefer: Been longest in the market with industry experts.3- SimplilearnProgram Name 1: Post Graduate Program in Data ScienceProgram Name 2: Data Science with R Certification CourseWhy should you prefer: Good content on Hand on projects4- EdurekaProgram Name 1: Data Scientist Masters ProgramProgram Name 2: Python Certification Training for Data Science.Why should you prefer: Great mini- courses series to refer to.5: Jigsaw Academy:Program Name 1: Post Graduate Diploma in Data ScienceProgram Name 2: Data Science Bootcamp certification courseWhy should you prefer: Quality ContentTheseThese Institutes will not only help you enlarge your learning experiences by helping through courses but will also help you out in placement support.

However, there are a few disadvantages. Data Science isn't awesome. We should comprehend its impediments to see the value in it completely.Below listed are some disadvantages1. Data Science is a Blurry TermData Science is a broad term that doesn't have a precise definition. Even though Data Scientist has become a well-known term, it's hard to characterize what it implies. The particular job of a Data Scientist relies upon the space that they are working in.Even though Some have depicted data Science as the fourth worldview in Science, it's anything but a basic rebranding or rebranding of Statistics.2. Data science isn't hard to dominateData Science is a blend of Computer Science, Mathematics, and Statistics. Therefore, it is difficult to be a specialist in each field. However, it is feasible to dominate them all.Notwithstanding the way that numerous online courses are attempting to address the abilities hole in the data science industry, it is as yet hard to become capable because of the sheer size of the field.Somebody with a foundation in Statistics probably won't be capable of expert Computer Science in a brief time frame to turn into a talented Data Scientist. It is a unique field that changes continually and expects one to keep finding out about Data Science.3. Space Knowledge is needed in huge amountsData Science's reliance on Domain Knowledge is another disservice. Without Domain Knowledge, it will be hard for somebody with a broad foundation in Statistics or Computer Science to take care of a Data Science issue.It is something similar for the other way around. A model: An individual working in the medical services area to break down genomic successions should have some data on hereditary qualities or atomic Science.Data Scientists would then be able to settle on educated choices to help the organization. However, it tends to be hard for Data Scientists with various foundations to acquire explicit area data. It is likewise hard to move to start with one industry then onto the next.4. Subjective data might yield unforeseen outcomesData Scientists examine the data and settle on expectations to assist with dynamics. Unfortunately, now and again, data isn't true to form and can be uncertain. Helpless administration and helpless utilization of assets can likewise prompt this disappointment.Comprehend the distinction between data science and data examination5. Issue with Data PrivacyData is the fuel for some enterprises. Data researchers help organizations settle on data-driven business choices. The data utilized in this cycle could be utilized to attack the protection privileges of clients.The parent organization can see individual customer data. This may, here and there, prompt data spills from security breaks. As a result, numerous businesses have raised moral worries about data security and its utilization.Online training institutions/courses for certification in Data Science1.Learnbay2.simplilearn3.udemy4.coursera5.Edureka1.2.3.4.5.My best suggestionAlthough we are aware that we are amid pandemics, institutions cannot stop learning.

In fact, I found this in a government memorandum:Now, do I believe the information provided by one person or multiple websites? Of course, I’d go with information on the official websites. This case to me looks baseless.From what I see, I don’t think it is fair to blame coaching centres and teachers for this. If CBI is no longer a nodal institute, it falls on the government to update the public. The communication gap cannot be the reason for drawing educational providers into a lawsuit.I think the government should come forward and clarify this. Otherwise, it’s just going to create a lot of confusion.!!!---!!!Statement 1I am an UPSC aspirant. I have never studied on any online platform however, this recent FIR against BYJU’S is baseless. Till now, whichever renowned website I have referred to has mentioned CBI as a nodal authority to receive and respond to all requests for assistance as a single point of contact and to act as liaison between the Ministry of External Affairs and other State parties on matters relating to the Convention as well as the Protocols.If this change was made by the government, then this should have been updated across every platform. From a third person point of view, I think Mumbai police should take the FIR back or at least clear BYJU’S name from it. This is unfair!Statement 2I have never applied for the UPSC exam so I am not sure about the curriculum details. But after this recent news about BYJU’S being sued for the wrong information in its UPSC syllabus, I tried searching for the information. All the websites I referred to mentioned that CBI is indeed a nodal authority.I am sharing the link for easy reference:Infact, a few renowned IAS websites too have included this information. I am sharing the links here:So, where is the information gap? Why this FIR only on one company which is trying to make a difference in the education sector? In my personal opinion, this is a selective targeting technique to gain attention.Statement 3:Food for thought. How propaganda is planted and how our fourth estate (media) fuels it.A company in business for 10 years is all of a sudden being targeted this entire month after making news of being India’s most valued start-up! Let me share the instances:The Indian media has lost its credibility in the last few years. It is sad to see one sided propaganda being fueled against Indian companies. Irrational, baseless allegations are given on the front page in the name of news. Media trails should stop. We cannot be allowing propaganda driven media trails to frame opinions about celebrities or brands.Statement 4I think BYJU’S as a company has attracted negative attention because it’s doing well. Whether it is facing backlash for acquiring a company, or negative feedback from parents, or now the FIR, the company has had its share of negative sentiments. Like the saying goes - if everything seems to be in control, maybe you are not doing it correctly. From whatever news I have read about BYJU’S, I think the company is doing some good work in revolutionizing the education sector. Whether you hate it or like it, online learning is here to stay and will definitely play a bigger role in the future of education. So, I feel that these are just testing times for the company and going by what they have done in the education space, they will overcome this hurdle as well.",15 followers,Virat Singh,1.2K,0,0,https://www.quora.com/How-can-I-learn-about-marketing-in-2020

The guy who gets through - gets through with or without Byjus while the Guys who dont get through - will not get through even with Byjus.Now an aggressive young man who is a BYJU supporter did tell me -The Sole difference here is - Complan does not make you grow - you can toss it in the Garbage can. After 3 years of BYJUS - when you dont get a good score in class XII - It CastigatesWhen your mother shouts and says “I paid Rs. 1,00,000/- to BYJUS and yet you have got only 83% - are you that worthless”???

They have the same modus operandi. They offer a free class in Coding and make the Parents believe their kid is the next Gates or Zuckerberg. They offer “Scholarships” which are predatory discounts.They make vague promises of Silicon Valley and Bill Gates and meeting big wigs to sell Apps etc.Their basic message based on their ads is - 144 Classes and your 6–9 Year old kid will be able to Create an App that can potentially be sold for a huge sum of money.Naive parents who have no clue about anything - read in the news about the Genius Indian Origin Girl in US or see the Stories of Wolf Gupta or read about Indians getting Crore rupee packages in Google.Naive parents are told “The Teacher said your kid is brilliant. Dont ruin your kids future”Most parentsOF COURSE when the Kid does not go to Silicon Valley - the excuses will come in a large number- Better Kids were there (Fictitious ones in most cases)This Ad of course was too much even for Indians. Too many people made fun of this AD.See the Logo here. See the Pic. The illusion is that Bill Gates is Endorsing WHJ. In reality - Gates hasIn US - WHJ could be sued for millions of dollars for such Advertisements.In India - a mother sees this ad and says “Bill Gates supports this company” - so i should admit my son to these classes.In the end - the only one to blame are usWe are so frightened by these people - that we lose faith in ourselves. We lose faith in our kids.We end up believing these fifth rate salesmen whose overall knowledge of what they sell can be fitted on a postage stamp.We end up believing the Celebrities who endorse these products because weve seen them playing such good roles on the screen.We are so suspicious of Free Resources - we say “If there is any substance - why should they make it free?”. The same thing a WHJ salesman told a woman who asked about the free coding site in one of the Phone calls on Youtube loaded by Mr Poonia.Next time a WHJ salesman calls - Parents can sayNext time a BYJUS salesman calls - Parents can sayIn US , UK, Australia, Europe - these ED TECHS will simply be ignored. Nobody will fall for their modus operandi.In China - these ED TECHS may be roasted for such a Modus OperandiOnly in India can they happily carry on.Sad isnt it???The Future of course is not rosy for Both BYJUS and WHJThey are Bubbles which cannot last in the world of Free Resources and Free Education.One day the Mothers will see that their Chintus are flunking Computer Science despite a Rs. 1 Lakh course with WHJOne day the mothers will see that their Chintus are heading for a Sales Executive Job in Tuni, AP rather than designing APIs or heading to Silicon ValleyOne day the mothers will see their Average sons- standing in queue with Rs. 6 Lakhs for an Engineering Seat despite Byjus CoursesThat day is not far off. There are no real results here. Its not that a 70% boy can get 96% and get a JEE rank.
