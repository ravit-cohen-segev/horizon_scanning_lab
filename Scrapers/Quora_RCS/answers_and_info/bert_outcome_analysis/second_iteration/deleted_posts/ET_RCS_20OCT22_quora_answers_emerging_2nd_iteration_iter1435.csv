I want to be clear about a few things and then explain why it makes me so angry to talk about publicly.First, I think this impeachment is utter nonsense.Let me ask readers throwing their hands in frustration about that comment one question, exactly which law did Trump break? What we have is a case where there exists no proof of anything illegal taking place, but a case of “abuse of power” because Trump demanded a “quid pro quo” arrangement with the Ukrainians to investigate his rival or he would withhold military aid. That’s what most of the people who keep yelling in my comments sections are saying.A few places that falls apart:When all the relevant facts are combined, we have a transcript that reads that Trump did point to this situation as needing investigation.It freaking does.Hunter Biden’s affiliation with Burisma, as well as the apparent use of government aid funds to cover it up by the Vice President himself, waves more red flags than Red Square on May Day. Why the public were so ill-informed on this obvious corrupt arrangement, that questions weren’t asked when he openly bragged about doing so, I can only blame on a media that refuses to hold Democrats accountable to the American people. No Republican would have gotten away with it without a very public lynching. To illustrate that point, I’m forced to ask what if it were Pence’s son? It can’t be, obviously, since Pence’s son is making about $50,000 aThis constant stream of “wrong for thee, but not for me” is infuriating.By the way, the answer to number one, the “crime” he committed is “High Crimes and Misdemeanors”, as well as “Obstruction of Congress.” Obstruction has lost all meaning, as the inquisitors threatened obstruction when they were simply holding informal hearings and demanding people show up, which absolutely no one had a legal obligation to do so. Now it seems that “obstruction” is just a bully tactic used whenever someone doesn’t throw themselves down on the mercy of the inquisition by declaring their guilt and naming everyone else involved like partisan’s trying to avoid the new dictator’s bullet in some third world purge. As for “high crimes and misdemeanors”, what exactly does this term 1% of Americans suddenly became experts on mean? According to Harvard Law Review — ""The majority view is that a president can legally be impeached for 'Oh, wait, but there’s more? Extortion? I see, well at least that’s a word that has some bite. In fact, it’s pretty weird that the language of the charges suddenly changed from “quid quo pro” to “extortion”. Why did it? Turns out, the narrative suddenly changed immediately after focus group showed that those polled responded more favorably to “extortion” more than to “quid quo pro”. Then, like magic, the language changed. If your charges ofWith all that in mind, this impeachment is little more than well-orchestrated political theater. The people in power who are dragging the rest of us through it are negotiating the stunt on the gamble that it will sway the American people by November.How?This whole spectacle, of course, amounts to theYeah, still waiting on all those apologies for all the time wasted and money lost that could have gone to all those poor kids at the border everyone cared about for exactly three weeks.And that’s the third thing. That’s the part that gets me and millions of other people so angry.This is turning out to be another tax-funded, partisan-driven attempt to simplyTo make a point, let’s have a review.How is this different from Stormy Daniels, Brett Kavanaugh, Freaking Russia Gate, or any of some half-dozen other supposed scandals against the President?Because this time…Shut up. It’s not. It’s not different, at all. It is a clear attempt to obstruct the President in carrying out his vision for helping the people he promised to help that won him the presidency.And that’s where the anger comes from. You’re not preventing Trump from winning. You’re just preventing him from helping people. There are millions of people in this country who experienced real suffering thanks to evermore extremist left wing policies and activism. The recession that hurt many of you for so many years never actually ended for some of us. Jobs we relied on were shipped overseas. We were forced to compete for what jobs were left with illegal immigrant labor unfairly able to work for less. And the most compassionate things we were told were thus:Move to the city, get a “real” education, move over so that the scales of history could be balanced. Disagree with any of this and you’re a bigot and we will make you suffer for life. But that doesn’t really matter, because we’re all just racists and fascists because reasons.How could you not expect these people to be angry, and how could you not expect these people to latch onto someone who is willingNote, that “and able” portion. It’s a funny thing that the most revolutionary Republicans must be celebrities. Look, I don’t like that either. I’m really afraid of Kanye in 2024, but you gotta look at facts here because this is your fault. That’s because, to win with conservatives, you must have your own channels to reach them — built in fame. Why? Because all other politicians rely on the same media to filter what it is they want to say to the American people. That matters because, as the last decade has proved, the media have clearly picked their favorites, and they are always on the same side of the aisle.And that side… wow, we should talk about that too.Did you know that Obama campaigned in 2008 under the the definition of “marriage” as being between a man and a woman? Yes, it wasn’t until 2009 that everyone on the left suddenly came to a different consensus on that one. It’s strange the way that so many millions of people can suddenly flip, as if a switch were thrown. Even more strange is that anyone who doesn’t, is suddenly a bigot for still holding the same views you did two years before. We also didn’t seem to have a problem with racism, as no one in 2010 viewed it as a crucial issue in our nation. By 2014, it was apparentlyThink about this. We’ve had a series of sudden and remarkable social upsets and collapses, and frankly, most people don’t agree with the Progressives. More importantly,I’m not telling you what to think, what to feel, and what to believe. I’m telling you that the vast majority of you only came to these conclusions 15 minutes ago, and I have a right to not be swayed by the bullying that everyone, even most Democrats and liberals, feel from the far left.And this is what I meant by “and able”. Trump wasn’t really affected by the bullying. He was rich enough that you couldn’t hurt his lifestyle or that of his family. He had his own media presence so he didn’t need to play nice to a biased media. That’s the key reason that so many other Republicans shifted so far to the left, and why so many millions of Americans felt unrepresented by them. In fact,That’s why Trump was able to win. He was able to honestly communicate the needs, wishes, and views of millions of people who were ignored by the broader culture that the media paid attention to. These were people who were either mocked and humiliated, bullied and harassed, vilified, or flat out ignored for the last eight years, and in some ways, the last few decades.AndAndDemocrats had a golden opportunity in 2016 to say to themselves, whoa, we really lost ourselves there for a while, but if we could solve some these people’s problems, maybe say we’re sorry about a few things, then we might have a real shot at 2020. But, no. For three weeks back in November, we thought that’s what it was going to be. Instead of doing that, they pulled out all the stops to Get Trump™. Instead of shifting to something more central, they went full tilt in embracing the most hard left policies they could, not because they actually have problems which these stances might solve, but to slap the face of those loathsome Trump supporters.Frankly, it doesn’t feel like an indictment against Trump, anymore. It feels like a personal attack on anyone who would dare to represent “Deplorable America.” Now, we are in the fourth year of an inquisition that feels like it will never end until everyone in the Washington establishment is fired and the Democrats are voted down to utter obscurity. And that’s exactly what a lot of people are talking about.Before, there were many of us who voted for Trump because we were voting against Hillary. I was the type of person who held my nose as I did it, not because I loved the guy, but because I loved the people who he said he’d represent. They were my people, people who didn’t have great lives and not through any fault of their own. They didn’t need much, just for some damaging policies to be relieved and to be listened to. But he did listen, he did keep many of his promises, and all this in spite of #Resistance. Frankly, now I’m impressed. He earned my vote.But not only that, I’m not just going to vote for Trump this year. I’m going to be one of millions voting against every single Democrat imaginable. I want them to lose in every place possible, from the Presidency down to the dog catchers. Only then, I believe, willBut there’s more. I don’t just want to get rid of elected officials. I want to fire every Democrat appointee in Washington. In addition, I want a return to the enforcement of libel laws so that bogus reporters and biased news agencies never print another word after lying as often as they have. And then, to all the biased universities encouraging students to take their side in politics, forcing divisions that are tearing the country apart while failing to provide meaningful and useful educations, they should lose their federal funding, as many taxpayers aren’t happy patronizing institutions preaching about how bigoted they are for existing. I’ll even go further. Those corporations with HR departments, hiring and promoting based on social justice quotas, or punishing and firing people based on absurd notions with no evidence claims of victimization, I want it easier to sue those companies for wrong-doing. And let’s not stop there. The companies in Silicon Valley, who grew to the point that they can literally control what we learn, control what we say, and by extension, control what we think… maybe it’s time words like anti-trust start being said more in earnest, and the era of tyrannical control of information and data be put to an end.And after all that, wait for the boycotts to start.Frankly, this impeachment was the latest in a long line of failures of the Democrats, and one which I fully believe will result in a massive win for Trump. I don’t really care about him personally, but I care very deeply about the people he cares about. I don’t even really think he “cares” about them in the sense of a deeply held compassion, but he is smart enough to know that you can’t leave that many people angry for this long and it not to be a sure ticket for someone to the White House. He’s doing right by them and I think that’s going to mean that he will devastate the 2020 election, as will all Republicans in any district and state where they have a fighting chance. The Democrats played a bad hand and it’s going to cost them a defeat that they will suffer for a generation.",277 followers,Joshua Alexander,3.8K,3.4K,74.1M,https://www.quora.com/What-does-Jon-Davis-think-about-the-current-impeachment-proceedings

What does this mean for the specter of authoritarianism looming over our libertarian principles?Consider he plays the role of the rational adult in the room. I’ll wait a bit while our liberal friends finish laughing. Consider that he does not go Full Metal Nixon and issue a grand Saturday Night Massacre to truly drain the swamp. Consider he calmly waits while the Senate acquits (which they will). O.k, o.k, so The Donald’s version of ‘calmly waits’ is a diarrhea hurricane of Twitter rants.If he does not respond to the House with a strong measure of justice any future president will face removal for political reasons by a majority opposition in the Legislature. This will usher in the tyranny of the majority.Now for the other option. Consider he does respond with measured strength. Again for our dear friends on the left, take your time, get the laughter out. Duty calls him to protect our Republic against a clear over reach by the House. Duty demands he not leave this injustice unanswered. I don’t see that as possible by a correction from the third branch of government, the Judiciary. The only possible course is for this much maligned President to take unprecedented action to correct the House. This will increase the power of the office of President.Every President since Washington has acted to increase the power of that office. This is not a good thing.This brings us closer to the tyranny of a monarch, delivered on the wings of the Irrational Left in their lust for power.President Trump will leave office. In all likelihood that will occur January of 2025. The current batch of Representatives will leave the House. That may come in a wave in 2022, but over the next 50 years this group will have departed office.

The problem is:Those jobs really aren’t coming back. That’s a fact. Apparently giving bad news is “condescending.”The bigger problem is that since 2016, Trump’s base has gone out of their way to justify all the contempt. If you had asked me in 2015, I would have spoken out in defence of rural folk from Georgia. I would have defended them against charges of ignorance and racism.But by voting for Trump, they have openly declared that I was wrong to have defended them.And those who gloated after the 2016 election, who said “suck it up,” who lied about why the majority who oppose Trump are in opposition, who ignore Trump locking up children in cages, who keep changing the subject, have lost any right to sympathy.To Mr. Davis, the following message: first Trump is out of office. Then we re-establish the principles that Republicans used to stand for.Then we can talk.But so long as Trump remains in office, there can be no discussion.",277 followers,Joshua Alexander,885,3.4K,74.1M,https://www.quora.com/What-does-Jon-Davis-think-about-the-current-impeachment-proceedings

5,"I started writing military stuff on Quora because, back in 2011, there was no one on Quora who wrote in that sphere.

I remember questions about Iraq being answered with, “They did this…” and “They did that…” all basically answered from the perspective of people who didn’t have a clue what they were talking about with a snide and undeserving arrogance. But CNN told them what to think and they didn’t think to question it. I was the first person many people on Quora ever heard say, “We did this…” and “When I was over there…” and it was a new experience for them. I was lucky too that the photo I used for my profiles was as a Marine in Iraq, so there wasn’t really a lot of questioning me on it.I also enjoyed every now and then, dipping into hypothetical military situations such as the invasion of Cinderella’s castle and mobilizing the US Olympic team to military ends. I had a crappy job at the time, so that was a great stress relief. That also showed a lot of people I wasn’t a military meat head, and that there was fun in there. It helped many to break the stereotype of what veterans were and make them open to what I, as well as other veterans, had to offer in this extremely liberal, extremely intellectual, extremely closed space.For a very long time, I had my niche, and I worked hard to network with other veterans who would show up, trying to create an environment where they could be appreciated. Together we built a presence on Quora where Military [ https://www.quora.com/topic/Military ] topics were well populated with talented writers. Through partnering with some of them, we built up Defense Quorum [ https://defense-quorum.quora.com/ ], a blog that actively shares and promotes military and veteran’s information. Now that community is growing independently and doing great, even for a Quora blog. Many of the regular writers even went on to become Top Writers, which was an awesome treat to see after the years of work we put in as a Quora veteran community.As for my politics, I was aware of the lean of the space since the first time I called someone a “lady” and was thoroughly talked down to for the sexism of the act. After that, I kept that part of my life hidden. Still, writing in military, and not really apologizing for Iraq bled into international politics, which bled into domestic politics, so it was going to happen eventually.Over the last few years, though, Quora really changed for me. I’d talked about the wars a lot, and didn’t really get much grief there, besides the occasional idiot calling me a murderer, but I never really got into domestic stuff until about three years ago.It started with the Ferguson shooting of Michael Brown in 2014. For those who don’t remember, that was when Michael Brown, a black man, was shot by a white police officer after assaulting the officer and strong-arm robbing a convenience store. There was such an uproar about the “murder” of Brown, particularly after the “Hands up; don’t shoot” story got out. Turns out, the story was just a cover for Brown’s accomplice and Brown’s shooting was completely justified. In any case, in the days after the shooting, everyone went nuts with riots and overreaction demanding “justice”.I said we should wait for the evidence.People went all over me for that. They had all the evidence they needed. The torches were lit, the pitchforks were sharp, and they’re ready for this police officer to get “the people’s justice”. I then spoke up on another incident, where some kids posed in front of a Confederate flag at a prom. I didn’t support the kids for it. After all, I’m a Republican. we were the ones who fought against slavery. What I spoke up about was the inappropriateness of protesters harassing the girl, a minor, at her house. They placed the girl in extreme danger that I felt was seriously inappropriate for such a demonstration. Look, kids are stupid, but what that mob did was bullying. Now it was confirmed. I was a Robert E. Lee loving racist who wanted all blacks back in the cotton fields.I had one writer in particular, with his cult of Social Justice Warrior yahoos who began badgering me with everything I wrote. This, of course, made me write more, because I hate bullies, which eventually escalated until some truly nasty nonsense started flying about. Moderation didn’t handle it fairly, in my opinion, so I really lost a lot my enthusiasm for the platform. Moderation has since then become a lot better, but I was pretty bitter.That said, I was getting frustrated with Quora, even before that, and spending more time on other outlets. Something in one of my feeds pointed me to a Conservative comedian Steven Crowder going off on some SJWs who were trying to interrupt a college talk he had been invited to (google: The Triggering). I was curious and, I don’t know why, wanted to watch the whole speech for context. Crowder did his thing, which I had already seen, but what really surprised me was this liberal feminist Democrat, Christina Hoff Sommers, who was completely attacked by the crowd. I felt it was disgusting, but it also opened my eyes to the realization that the treatment I had received on Quora was no different than what anyone who speaks out against this control narrative got with their hateful vicious tactics. I began to see that I was just another one of those guys who “they” didn’t like. It was good to no longer feel isolated, as if I was somehow this thing worthy of hate. That said, in a sphere that I had always appreciated for being an open place where people were sharing their views, it now became clear to me that there were people using it for nasty methods instead, just to spread their ideology by silencing people they hated.They were bullies.If you’ve read a lot of my stuff, you’ll notice that I have also written a lot about bullying. I was bullied a lot as a kid. That was until I was in 7th grade and I finally stood up to my bully. Since then, I’ve known that the best way to deal with bullies is to call them out and stand up to them.I hate bullies, so that’s what I did. I doubled down on BNBR, but I poked holes in every argument I could. I stopped going to Quora for my own information or for casual reading. I was engrossed in reading books and listening to talks by Conservative speakers, so my arguments were completely foreign to the bubble on Quora. Because I felt I had this enemy to fight against, not Liberals, Progressives, or even the left in general, but the nasty tactics of SJW bullies, particularly those in the Top Writer community, that it gave me a lot to do.Then the election happened. Everyone, everyone, everyone and their dog had to take part in the circle jerk of bandwagon hatred of Donald Trump. I, however, was the Conservative who was from the type of small town that had suffered under exactly the sort of bad Democratic planning and social systems he spoke out against, not to mention being ignored if not alienated by the broader media and culture. So even though he wasn’t my first pick (Marco Rubio), I settled with him because he was at least acknowledging my existence and that of people I cared about.When I came out with that, it was sort of a shock to people.

At the time, of course, the only basis for impeachment was that he had won the 2016 election, but the Democrats were eager to do so, and admitted it.Within weeks, the cabal to destroy his presidency was pushing to have him investigated on charges of having worked with the Russians to affect the outcome of the election, in the hope he would either resign or be unable to accomplish anything (neither of which occurred).When the investigation, headed by Robert Mueller, a card-carrying member of the cabal, concluded it’s investigation, unable to establish that Trump or any other American citizen had collaborated with the Russians on the 2016 election, it was literally a matter of a day or so before some Democrat embedded in the Trump administration to find dirt on Trump claimed that the President had, on a call to the President of Ukraine, asked for assistance in investigating his political opponent, Joe Biden, and possibly tied that request to the disbursement of an American aid package.What Trump actually had requested assistance on was Biden’s own taped brag session of how he had forced the government of the Ukraine to fire it’s head solicitor by threatening to withhold $1 billion in American funds. It later turned out that the solicitor was about to investigate the firm Biden’s son worked for, which brought up concerns about corruption, particularly charges that Biden was using his office to benefit himself or a member of his family, which would be a federal crime.Trump’s request was within the parameters of both his job description as per the Constitution of the United States and the 1999 treaty between the Ukraine and the U.S. agreeing to assist each other on uncovering crime and corruption. None the less, his request for that assistance was considered by the Democratic spook as somehow an impeachable offense.As to the aid package, Trump and members of his administration insisted that the aid was being delayed until there was reason to believe that the corruption that has bedeviled the Ukraine would not interfere with the military aid going where it was supposed to.And that, too, is one of Trump’s responsibilities as per the Constitution.The Democrats in control of the House, which had been avidly seeking an excuse for impeachment, joyfully took it up. Today, 12/1/2019, the impeachment effort continues and is expected to be voted on before Christmas. If the House does vote for impeachment, the Senate trial will begin next year and will overlap the beginning caucuses of the 2020 election.So for the entire first term of this president, he has been hounded by the Left’s determination and constant efforts to destroy his presidency.He has achieved an astonishing record compared to previous presidents, but it’s difficult to know what he might have achieved had he been given even a minimal amount of cooperation from the opposing party.Whether the current impeachment effort will damage Trump’s presidency, or the one the Left will take up when this one’s over, or the one after that, or the one after that, can never be actually proved.But it is clear that one of our most productive Presidents cannot be other than hampered in his efforts by the opposition party.","4,845 followers",Jon Michael Sakamoto,1K,3.4K,16.7M,https://www.quora.com/What-does-Jon-Davis-think-about-the-current-impeachment-proceedings

The Republicans did not hesitate to impeach Bill Clinton. Their impeachment rhetoric, then and now, is as hypocritical as it is possible to be in English. They did not hesitate to block Obama’s Supreme Court appointee and to announce they would block the Obama administration’s every Democratic bill in the Senate. They still do.Republicans, even with their share of independents, are the minority. Democrats outnumber them. By gerrymandering, voter roll purging and illegal foreign assistance they controlled all three branches of government. Our own civility has been used against us.Some Republicans now call impeachment a coup, but the coup has already happened. The smaller block of voters, that tell pollsters themselves that pushing back advances in rights for women and minorities are more important to them than the economy and jobs, have stolen control by unrepentant manipulation of the system. And what they have accomplished with that undeserved control was atrocious.In order to protect the Republic and defend the Constitution, the larger number of us must work together and curtail these abuses now. We have done it before.It is said that democracies end in tyranny but only if you let them.",282 followers,Michael Anderson,2.6K,1.9K,1.8M,https://www.quora.com/What-does-Jon-Davis-think-about-the-current-impeachment-proceedings

But we always kept in touch. We’d see each other at events, catch up on the phone now and then, wish one another “Happy Birthday,” and maybe have dinner on the off chance we were in the same city.I now realize I never really knew you.In thinking back there were the hints, which surfaced over dinner, or in a chat on the phone, that perhaps you supported Republicans, or were unsatisfied with President Obama. … So I’ll keep my ears open, but unless you experience a truly deep transformation, I’m simply being honest when I say we can no longer be friends.What complete and utter garbage and disgustingly unamerican. I don’t care about his politics, vote how you want to, but to literally advocate to the millions of people who read the Huffington Post to unfriend their Donald Trump voting friends? This is not Liberalism. Nothing about that is descended from the ideas forged in the American Enlightenment, and resembles nothing of the thought of John Locke and Henry David Thoreau. This is tantamount to OrwellianI’ve argued thatThe fact, however, was that none of that was based on things he actually said. Where he did talk about immigration was, upon reading the actual sourced material, was based on actual problems with the immigration system, and not on calling the whole of Mexico rapists. This was most obvious to the many, many legal Mexican immigrants who voted for Trump, but whose voices were silenced during the campaign by all thoseThe same was true of Islamic immigrants. Policies of limiting immigration from specific countries or regions where there is reason to doubt the civility of the migrants or their ability to adapt to the American culture. In that, he is expressing use of a power of the United States government to deny entry of certain classes and groups. It needs to be also mentioned that he would not be the first to do so.Section 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 states: “Whenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may by proclamation, and for such period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate.”For scope, President Obama used this power no less than six times. President George W. Bush, six more. President Bill Clinton, another six times. President George H. W. Bush once, and President Ronald Reagan used it five times in office. The interesting one is President Jimmy Carter.In April 1980, as the U.S embassy in Tehran was under terrorist control, Carter signed anWhen asked about the legality of President-elect’s right to ban, or individuals from nations experiences increased sectarian violence and radical Islamic terrorism, Law Professor Jan Ting of Temple University said clearly “absolutely and without any doubt” does there exist law to allow Trump to restrict immigration of certain nationalities or religious groups.Now, to focus on you, the OP of this question. I see that you are Chilean. I’ve always wanted to say this to a Chilean, you have a cool flag. That said, my question is simply this, what exactly are you afraid of? Concentration camps? We live in the information age and one where every news media organization is yearning for the story that forces an impeachment of Donald Trump. This isn’t 1940’s Europe where 10’s of thousands could be mostly unaware of what was happening just beyond the city limits. We simply don’t have the ability to mysteriously make tens of thousands of people disappear. We simply don’t live in a world where concentration camps are possible.Mass deportation? Is that a concern? Then I would ask why. Are you here legally? Then you have nothing to worry about. We created a system for your incorporation for this very reason. Are your friends not here legally? That might be a problem. They may be forced to go home, where they will suffer the advantage of skills and experience gained in America to lead a better life than the one they left the first time, even using those skills to try again to come to the United States through the legal route.That said, I don’t want you to be scared. I want you to read different news sources. We live in a world of overwhelming information, but the sad truth is that if you don’t read from at least 5 different sources about the same event then you know you aren’t getting anywhere near the whole story. It’s the cost of freedom, I’m afraid. That said, too many people have been listening to bad news for too long that they have no clue how the world actually works, but I have to ask a simple question. If you know for a fact that you are reading news that was so disconnected with reality that they this happened, I have to ask you why you put so much stock in them to let them make you so afraid.And it didn’t stop on election night. I posted yesterday’s Huffington Post article, so you can gauge how well they are adapting to having already ignored millions of people. Since the election we’ve had numerous rounds of the news media trying to reclaim itself by running its own name in the dirt by spreading fear and hatemongering… by reporting about spreading fear and hate mongering.I made a case of this by unveiling several of the reported hate crimes by Trump supporters immediately after the election to be completely falsified, including this report of a gay bashing in a bar, and another of a fake KKK march, both of which had gone viral and then echoed by the mass media.This is in spite of the completely unreported actual cases of hate crimes which came out of the riots following Trump’s election.Then there was this girl being physically assaulted and viciously beaten for posting a message in support of Donald Trump. The video speaks for itself.A final example, the firebombing of a North Carolina GOP Office.A GOP office in Hillsborough, North Carolina, was firebombed. Outside a swastika was spray painted with the words ""Nazi Republicans leave town or else"". This didn’t even happen after the election, but in October.I want to be clear. This is terrorism. This was the violent and premeditated destruction of property and threatening manipulation of innocent people by politically motivated actors. They destroyed property and attempted to threaten voters out of the democratic process. This should have been the biggest story in the world at the time, but instead the media reported that Trump was mean because he called the terrorists “animals.” Again, that was the Washington Post, I believe. I know that some people may say that I called the writer for Huffington Post, Michelangelo Signorile, a fundamentalist for advocating the world stop listening to people who disagree with him, but in Iraq, it wasn’t the mullahs and the imams that planted bombs and killed people. They just said things and the kinds of things coming from the Left are the kinds of things leading toAnd then when the media began to wipe the egg off their face for that, then suddenly #fakenews happened.Many believed this election represented a very important shift in the way that people get their news. Dave Rubin of the Rubin Report, a YouTuber who runs an extremely professional talk show debating politics, said that he believed this election signaled the point where more people got their news from non-traditional platforms than the bias media outlets, and more from small independently ran content creators such as himself, other YouTubers, or even me. What he and others are speculating is that the shift was made because of how many people lost respect for media that was so completely out of touch with what was going on in the world, that it is now more common to go the independent route. I don’t know if we are there yet, but the writing is on the wall for the death of traditional media.The backlash from that seems to be a desperate push to label all news you don’t like as “fake news”, particularly Right aligned or small independent news sources. It’s really starting to appear that the “fake news” outrage everyone is talking about is less about how fake news caused the presidency and more about the desperate attempt of traditional media to discredit new media. I mean, when Brian Williams, the anchor who claimed to have dodged a rocket attack in a crashing helicopter, only to be outed as a liar by the actual soldiers who were there, starts talking about “fake news”, we know we have a problem.So yeah, I believe you that you are afraid. Coming from another country where most of your information comes from Left leaning professors, upper middle class suburbanite tweenies, and a news media that is losing more and more credibility by the day, I would suspect that you would be afraid. That said, this last month has been a national wake up call for so much of the wrong opinions and false narratives that have been floating out there. What can you do to feel better about it? Read other news. If anyone says that places like Brietbart, Daily Caller, Rebel Media, or the Blaze are biased, read them anyway. Get another side of the story so that you can at least know that there is something more going on. You don’t have to agree with it, but at least you don’t have the excuse of being fed only one voice.I hope this helps.Jon","115,003 followers",Daveed Phoenix,928,9.9K,160M,https://www.quora.com/What-does-Jon-Davis-think-about-the-current-impeachment-proceedings

He was someone who could make “the stick” in the American political machine truly meaningful. That said, I’ve felt on a military front, the President has already made great strides in resurrecting the world’s respect in not just the power, but the potency and credibility of the American military machine.Having said that, we need to talk about Syria. I was very pleased with the strike. It seemed very good in regard to sending a message of what line the Americans will not allow the Syrians to cross now that there is a new boss in town while not getting further embroiled their civil war.With regard to ISIS, he’s making strides and I like that there are some serious signs of an American military presence on the ground there, though I would like to see more done.With China, I felt his meeting with President Xi was very apt to do in the effort of building international relations. From the reports I’ve seen, he showed humility and hospitality with the Chinese leader, while simultaneously showing the impressive strength of the US military through dropping the MOAB in Afghanistan. I don’t care how much you hate the man, that was well done.North Korea… F’n North Korea. This is where I think everyone is holding their breath. In simple terms. I’m of two minds. On the one hand — North Korea is always doing this crap. They are always promoting a “Death to all Americans” tirade before attempting to launch a missile. I’m going to be honest, I don’t feel threatened, because even if they develop a weapon that could reach the United States, they simply don’t have enough weapons manufacturing capability to get past our missile defense systems in Alaska. Russia could, hypothetically, but not North Korea, or China for that matter. Perhaps they could sneak one in via submarine, but I see any of those options beingWhat I am more concerned with is North Korea goingMexico. He was elected to build the wall and improve the illegal immigration problem in the United States. Just by being elected, Border Patrol agents have recorded the largest drop in illegal immigration ever, but there has been almost nothing done toward fulfilling his promises with actual policy. This is ticking a lot of his constituency off.Canada. He’s done a lot to work with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, which I’m glad, because Trudeau was being kind of a smug twit to President Trump during the elections. So I am glad that Trump is being gracious. He did, however, make one failure that I found it hard to defend. There was a mosque attack earlier in the year, and Trump made no statement toward the victims. Granted I don’t think anyone involved in a killing gives a damn about tweets, but it is a kind of political obligation now, and he didn’t do it. That made him look bad when it could have been easy to at least avoid some negative attention. I made arguments that no matter what he said it would be depicted in a negative light, but that was honestly something he could have done better, if by no other way than just hiring an aide who does nothing but tell him nice things to say when bad things happen.Finally, Russia. Russia is not our friend. Their history and geopolitics demand that they attempt to spread their borders as far from Russia as they can. That means getting bases and assets all around Eastern Europe. Now they are looking to get a hold on the Middle East by way of Syria. That’s concerning, because they will have Turkey partially surrounded and will be within easy striking distance of literally everything else in the region to support operations or push their agenda. Their energy stranglehold over Europe is also concerning as they could basically cut off the gas to Germany and get whatever they wanted out of the regional power.So I was a bit WTF about how buddy-buddy Trump was with the Russians. That was until I did a report on Russia for a friend. That’s when I discovered the “Reset Button”. When Obama took office, the United States under George W. Bush was in an increasing period of tension with Russia over a missile defense system being installed in the Balkans. Obama showed up and came in to smooth everything over. He employed his Secretary of State, I’m sure you’ve heard of her, to meet with her Russian counterpart to literally push a reset button on diplomatic relations with Russia. Yes, a literal button.Rumor has it though, that the Russian translation of the button is actually “Overload”. I’d be curious if our Russian speaking friends can confirm that.Either way, that was a ridiculous spectacle, but the history lesson keyed me in on something important — this is a cycle, because something similar happened from Clinton to Bush too. Russia always seeks to build up and press for advantage towards the end of an eight year Presidency cycle. They wait until a President no longer has to worry about getting reelected and has committed his forces, then engage in conflicts which the Americans are more or less powerless to do much about it. Then, there is a major regime change in US politics (almost like clockwork) and Russia wants to play nice. During that time, both the US and Russia pull back militarily, shore up loose points in their defenses, consolidate forces for a grand strategy over the coming years, and the game starts over. We are now in the “reset button” phase of that game.I’ve said things with Russia are going to start getting anxious again in mid-2019 with talks on Russia a major part of the 2020 campaigns, namely by the Democrats accusing Trump of being too friendly with the Russians in the beginning, when, in all honesty… I think Trump’s team is doing exactly what they are supposed to be doing at this point.Or maybe he really is getting all buddy with Putin and we are all screwed. Who knows? I’ll say this. The President is being inundated with nonsense on the home-front which is distracting him from being able to do his job overseas. As of right now, I am satisfied with the job he has done, but I would like for him to have the opportunity to close the books on many of the local matters to focus beyond our shores. I’ve wondered if major compromises he’s made, such as the recent budget proposal, are him trying to pacify the Democrats so that he can do just that.I know this is an optimistic forecast, but so far, I am feeling optimistic. Still, there have been some very good moves, and some real head-scratchers. He inherited a mess, so I hope he manages. Sadly, the well has been poisoned so much that I think many Americans honestly hope he fails and are working towards that goal… even if that means the pilot crashes the plane we are all on.Thank you for reading.

Why not?!Top 3 aerospace engineer JobsSee all aerospace engineer jobsWhat Aerospace Engineers Do[Aerospace engineers design primarily aircraft, spacecraft, satellites, and missiles. In addition, they test prototypes to make sure that they function according to design.Duties of Aerospace EngineersAerospace engineers typically do the following:Aerospace engineers may develop new technologies for use in aviation, defense systems, and spacecraft. They often specialize in areas such as aerodynamic fluid flow; structural design; guidance, navigation, and control; instrumentation and communication; robotics; and propulsion and combustion.Aerospace engineers can specialize in designing different types of aerospace products, such as commercial and military airplanes and helicopters; remotely piloted aircraft and rotorcraft; spacecraft, including launch vehicles and satellites; and military missiles and rockets.Aerospace engineers often become experts in one or more related fields: aerodynamics, thermodynamics, celestial mechanics, flight mechanics, propulsion, acoustics, and guidance and control systems.Aerospace engineers typically specialize in one of two types of engineering: aeronautical or astronautical.Aeronautical engineersAstronautical engineersAeronautical and astronautical engineers face different environmental and operational issues in designing aircraft and spacecraft. However, the two fields overlap a great deal because they both depend on the basic principles of physics.Work Environment for Aerospace Engineers[Aerospace engineers held about 72,500 jobs in 2014. The industries that employed the most aerospace engineers were as follows:They are employed in industries where workers design or build aircraft, missiles, systems for national defense, or spacecraft. Aerospace engineers work primarily for firms that engage in manufacturing, analysis and design, research and development, and for the federal government.Aerospace engineers now spend more of their time in an office environment than they have in the past, because modern aircraft design requires the use of sophisticated computer equipment and software design tools, modeling, and simulations for tests, evaluation, and training.Aerospace engineers work with other professionals involved in designing and building aircraft, spacecraft, and their components. Therefore, they must be able to communicate well, divide work into manageable tasks, and work with others toward a common goal.Aerospace Engineers Work SchedulesAerospace engineers typically work full time. Engineers who direct projects must often work extra hours to monitor progress, to ensure that the design meets requirements, to determine how to measure aircraft performance, to see that production meets design standards, and to ensure that deadlines are met.How to Become an Aerospace Engineer[Get the education you need:Aerospace engineers must have a bachelor’s degree in aerospace engineering or another field of engineering or science related to aerospace systems. Aerospace engineers who work on projects that are related to national defense may need a security clearance. U.S. citizenship may be required for certain types and levels of clearances.Aerospace Engineer EducationEntry-level aerospace engineers usually need a bachelor’s degree. High school students interested in studying aerospace engineering should take courses in chemistry, physics, and math, including algebra, trigonometry, and calculus.Bachelor’s degree programs include classroom, laboratory, and field studies in subjects such as general engineering principles, propulsion, stability and control, structures, mechanics, and aerodynamics, which is the study of how air interacts with moving objects.Some colleges and universities offer cooperative programs in partnership with regional businesses, which give students practical experience while they complete their education. Cooperative programs and internships enable students to gain valuable experience and to finance part of their education.At some universities, a student can enroll in a 5-year program that leads to both a bachelor’s degree and a master’s degree upon completion. A graduate degree will allow an engineer to work as an instructor at a university or to do research and development. Programs in aerospace engineering are accredited by ABET.Important Qualities for Aerospace EngineersAnalytical skills.Business skills.Critical-thinking skills.Math skills.Problem-solving skills.Writing skills.Licenses, Certifications, and RegistrationsLicensure is not required for entry-level positions as an aerospace engineer. A Professional Engineering (PE) license, which allows for higher levels of leadership and independence, can be acquired later in one’s career. Licensed engineers are called professional engineers (PEs). A PE can oversee the work of other engineers, sign off on projects, and provide services directly to the public. State licensure generally requires:The initial FE exam can be taken after one earns a bachelor’s degree. Engineers who pass this exam are commonly called engineers in training (EITs) or engineer interns (EIs). After meeting work experience requirements, EITs and EIs can take the second exam, called the Principles and Practice of Engineering.Advancement for Aerospace EngineersEventually, aerospace engineers may advance to become technical specialists or to supervise a team of engineers and technicians. Some may even becomeAerospace Engineer Salaries[The median annual wage for aerospace engineers was $105,380 in May 2014. The median wage is the wage at which half the workers in an occupation earned more than that amount and half earned less. The lowest 10 percent earned less than $66,110, and the highest 10 percent earned more than $155,240.In May 2014, the median annual wages for aerospace engineers in the top industries in which they worked were as follows:Aerospace engineers typically work full time. Engineers who direct projects must often work extra hours to monitor progress, to ensure that the design meets requirements, to determine how to measure aircraft performance, to see that production meets design standards, and to ensure that deadlines are met.Job Outlook for Aerospace Engineers[Employment of aerospace engineers is projected to decline 2 percent from 2014 to 2024. Aircraft are being redesigned to cut down on noise pollution and to raise fuel efficiency, which will help sustain demand for research and development. However, growth will be tempered because many of these engineers are employed in manufacturing industries that are projected to grow slowly or even decline.Most of the work of aerospace engineers involves national defense–related projects or the design of civilian aircraft. Research-and-development projects, such as those related to improving the safety, efficiency, and environmental soundness of aircraft, should sustain demand for workers in this occupation.Aerospace engineers who work on engines or propulsion will continue to be needed as the emphasis in design and production shifts to rebuilding existing aircraft so that they are less noisy and more fuel efficient.In addition, as governments refocus their space efforts, new companies are emerging to provide access to space beyond the access afforded by standard space agencies. The efforts of these companies will include low-orbit and beyond-earth-orbit capabilities for human and robotic space travel. Unmanned aerial vehicles will create some opportunities for aerospace engineers as authorities find domestic uses for them, such as finding missing persons lost in large tracts of forest or helping to put out forest fires.Aerospace Engineers Job ProspectsAerospace engineers who know how to use collaborative engineering tools and processes and who are familiar with modeling, simulation, and robotics should have good opportunities. Employment opportunities also should be favorable for those trained in computational fluid dynamics software, which has enabled companies to test designs in a digital environment, thereby lowering testing costs. Finally, the aging of workers in this occupation should help to create openings in it over the next decade.Employment projections data for Aerospace Engineers, 2014-24Careers Related to Aerospace Engineers[Aerospace Engineering and Operations TechniciansAerospace engineering and operations technicians operate and maintain equipment used in developing, testing, and producing new aircraft and spacecraft. Increasingly, these workers are using computer-based modeling and simulation tools and processes in their work.Architectural and Engineering ManagersArchitectural and engineering managers plan, direct, and coordinate activities in architectural and engineering companies.Computer Hardware EngineersComputer hardware engineers research, design, develop, and test computer systems and components such as processors, circuit boards, memory devices, networks, and routers. These engineers discover new directions in computer hardware, which generate rapid advances in computer technology.Electrical and Electronics Engineering TechniciansElectrical and electronics engineering technicians help engineers design and develop computers, communications equipment, medical monitoring devices, navigational equipment, and other electrical and electronic equipment. They often work in product evaluation and testing, using measuring and diagnostic devices to adjust, test, and repair equipment. They are also involved in the manufacture and deployment of equipment for automation.Electrical and Electronics EngineersElectrical engineers design, develop, test, and supervise the manufacturing of electrical equipment, such as electric motors, radar and navigation systems, communications systems, and power generation equipment.

Candidate should prepare next 40 pagesI recently attended an interview in White Hat junior and I wanted to share my experience here. First, I will give an overall idea about recruitment process.First round was a telephonic one, they asked about the my details and shared a pdf of 50 pages. Next I had a technical setup call with the technical team. In that they checked my Laptop and network connection.After that they asked me to take 3 demo classes, in those classes one of the employee will act like a student. In the first demo class they needed to teach the first 25 pages from the pdf shared. Candidate should prepare next 40 pages for second demo then full document for the third demo.Here come the points why I got a bad impression on White Hat Junior,I had a short telephonic discussion to start with and I was told that if I gets selected then I should take minimum 4 hours session per day. This recruitment is for US/Canada students so the timing will be 10.30pm -7.30 am (IST-Night shift).But in the first demo class the interviewer told me to take minimum 30 hr per week.In the second demo the interviewer mentioned that the classes should be taken in both Indian and US timing.In the 3rd demo the interviewer asked me to take 40 hours per week.The point here is that the three interviewers are having three different rules for the same candidate. I felt they have lack in integrity about the basic things.They will give you the document which you have to teach and you need to teach the students it within 45 minutes. I have around 3 years of experience in teaching and very passionate about it. But the experience I got it from this platform was very humiliating and valueless by questioning the ability of a person to teach students in a stipulated time. They want people who are like robots who complete the class within 45 minutes without even understanding what the student needs, in this 45 minutes we should interact with the student, make the student understand about student panel in the system, showcase prototypes that other students have done and also need to explain entire course structure with the parent. So, you can figure out how to make the above things covered in 45 mins.They are focusing only on business not the basic quality of teaching. If you want to make the student understand then you need to spend more time. Different students have different ability of grasping things, so as a teacher we need to understand the pulse and teach them based on that. In those cases, we can’t stick on the time. At the end of the day, student should gain some knowledge as takeaway. White hat junior is focusing only on business.I have a request to White hat jr, If you want to get students you do some advertising/give a separate class for parents don’t evaluate the teachers teaching capability.So, if anyone is planning to attend White Hat Junior interview, You know how it works and decided if you need opt for this or not.",UNKNOWN,Anonymous,3.6K,0,0,https://www.quora.com/What-does-Jon-Davis-think-about-the-current-impeachment-proceedings
20,"I have cleared the Whitehat interview with high scores 96+ and 100 in final round.These are myInterview processI have cleared the Whitehat interview with high scores 96+ and 100 in final round.These are myInterview processHere's, my two cents on the entire process and policies:I guess that's it! Read well and decide for yourself, if the job suits you well and vice versa. 🙂P.S: I didn't join the teaching platform, due to their non transparent approach during the interviews. It appeared misleading and just a luring tactic to hire, while it could have been a sync issue as well. Flexible timings was the USP as per the advertisement, which didn't work out later. Regardless, any experience teaches you well. You can go ahead and decide once you clear the demo rounds. You will at least learn a few more tips for online interactive teaching.",UNKNOWN,Anonymous,575,0,0,https://www.quora.com/What-does-Jon-Davis-think-about-the-current-impeachment-proceedings

LOLROUND 2A pdf of 42 pages was shared with us and I was asked to give a demo for the first 25 pages. There was this particular project in code.o*g where the screen color changes with the click of the button. Also it is block based coding. It will be of no use for the child who wants to learn coding. It even has text based coding but the syllabus framed does not suit a 6 or 7 year old.Forget to mention the pdf is actually a sales book where they have ranted about the apps developed by the kids of whitehat jr. I myself an IT Professional and I would rate a negative rating to the quality of assignments they provide.ROUND 3The final round . I was again asked to give demo of the full pdf which consists of fancy words like sillicon valley and space tech. Mind you parents please do not fall for these absolute crap.I GOT SELECTED. THE REAL SCAM AWAITS USWe have the provision to reimburse the internet bill but not to fall for this perk. We were asked to maintain 120 hours a month inclusive of both indian and foreign students. No human can maintain 120 hours a month. We cannot sit and work for 6 -7 hours straight. Even in IT we take atleast a 10 minute break.For leaves and others they have a cancellation policy too.We are supposed to book all the slots from 9 am - 9 pm for indian students and 10 pm - 8 am for foreign students. We are supposed to be available all the time in these slots during the first three months as it is the trial class period. The algorithm allots the trial class students randomly so we will not be sure when the slot will be booked so we have to stay open every time.You will start earning only when your trial class is converted as paid class. They even stress on the conversion rate. When I got selected they created a whatsapp group where they asked us to use sillicon valley and space tech program to lure the parents. To stay ahead in the rat race the kids should start to code. I felt bad for all the parents who wasted their hard earned money in this scam.I left from there and never looked back atleast I can sleep without guilt. To the tutors who are in this scam please come out of this. You are selling lies in the form of a noble profession called “Teacher”.Dear parents if you want your kid to be a programmer in future. Teach him maths as it is the base for everything. Teach him how internet works … how the gadgets around him works. Enroll him to a music class to improve his concentration. Encourage him to ask questions. Kids these days lack reading habit… buy them good books instead of these scam coding courses.Coding is all about logics, creativity and problem solving. Being a developer in an IT firm I can guarantee that their syllabus is good for nothing.You may ask me why did I apply for the job despite working in IT. Right now am not working since pandemic. I was curious to know about them amidst the buzz.Peace out.",UNKNOWN,Anonymous,10.1K,0,0,https://www.quora.com/What-does-Jon-Davis-think-about-the-current-impeachment-proceedings
