The last one (ATTiny85) does not have (a real) OS at all, other than some simple routines to execute a program and maybe collect garbage etc.Displaying stuff is not necessarily an important task of an OS at all. AsDisplay-or-not-display aside, “Are operating systems a must?”, you say. Well, it depends.For “complex” computers, Yes. Because complex computers are supposed to be running multiple complex software programs simultaneously in a multi-tasking manner. And this is where an OS shines. The OS manages all the resources these programs need, loads their machine code to the CPU to run, allocates them the RAM required, re-acquires the RAM when a program quits, and manages all the processes inside the computer etc. This is no simple work.For “less complex” computers, well it depends. 286 computers runs on MS-DOS operating system, which runs programs one by one (non-multitasking). But a Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) does not have an OS (yet it display a lot of beautiful things ;). It will run whatever program in the cartridge you insert to the system.For “very simple computers”, No. Like the ATTiny85, these computers are meant to run a single piece of code loaded into the “program” memory space inside the chip. As soon as there is power, the program will run. Not many processes to manage, not much else to do house-keeping.So to conclude","220,155 followers",Franklin Veaux,2.8K,47.3K,779.5M,https://www.quora.com/Would-a-complex-computer-that-doesnt-need-to-display-anything-need-an-OS

So even if you were only going to run a single program, an OS is still useful because it gives you a ready-made library of hardware drivers and the like — services you might want to use in your single program.Screens are just one of the many resources that an OS manages. If your computer is truly “complex” — able to run more than one program — then it needs an OS. And even if it will only run one program, an OS is still useful.The only time I have see a computer seriously run without an OS (I think) was when a PC was booted with a disk that contained a single game (Frogger). The game itself was the operating system, you might say. It controlled disk access, the screen, and all other resources.

So did any hopes of becoming a strong engineer that could support NASA missions, like the people at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.Living in the landlocked Midwest, far from any launch sites, my family could never travel to see any launches. To this day, I’ve never witnessed any rocket launch—and not from any fault in trying. My handful of trips to Florida are peppered with launch postponements.So over the years, I could only watch films of past missions, and with others today, streamed videos of a launch.My first space simulator was a Space Shuttle simulator that ran on a 1986 Macintosh Plus computer with an insane (at the time) 1 MB of RAM. It was slow and overly complicated. I quickly lost interest in trying to play it.Decades later, I hear about this Kerbal thing. And one day, I looked it up. It looked interesting, and I heard good things about it. The US $40 price tag was attractive.

I was going to build a rocket ship that could orbit Mun and return to Kerbol because I thought of it as an important step in an eventual lunar landing. So after several iterations of a design I finally settled on a ship that largely used old (and cheap) components with some newer more powerful rocket engines and the mission was underway!Stage 1 of the mission was to ascend to near space and create a stable orbit about 88k kilometers above the planet which I achieved with relative ease.Stage 2 was to align the vessel dubbed “Munshot” so that I could make the trip from Kerbol to an orbit around mun. In this phase it took me several orbits around Kerbol before I could get a good alignment and I burned through far more fuel than anticipated.Back at ground control there was some consternation. I wasn't sure that there was enough rocket fuel to finish the mission. After much deliberation I shrugged my shoulders and decided “Eh… might as well go for it!” Now Herman was very excited, despite the low fuel he had full confidence in his mission as judged by the huge smile in his face, though in hindsight the only thing that outstripped Herman's bravery was his stupidity so he was always pretty confident anyway.Stage 3 was to head for Mun, achieved by reaching the side of Kerbol farthest from Mun and extending the orbit until we passed by the planet's satellite.We reached Mun! Here I flirted with the idea of just letting Munshot return to Kerbol. I only had a few minutes to make a decision and seeing Herman's smiling beaming face convinced me to proceed as planned.Stage 4 was to orbit Mun and gather some observational data by having my daring pilot look out the single window in the command module and describe what he sees. This would have yielded me precious precious science to be used for further technological advances.Stage 5 was return to Kerbol. So when it came time to line up a return trip it was all power to thrusters and… we only got a partial escape from orbit when we ran out of fuel.Stage 6a oh shit oh shit, damn, now what?Stage 6b eject the command module toward Kerbol and cross your digits!Stage 7 how the hell did that work?By this point Herman and the Munshot command module, devoid of any type of propulsion, were traveling at a crawl through space toward Kerbol by sheer inertia. To lift his spirits I set the command module into a spin to amuse him. He seemed to like that. I tried to develop the tech to stage a rescue mission but eventually the Munshot command module made it back to Kerbol on its own and survived reentry without me even noticing thanks to my built in safety precautions. Despite spending 16 months in the Munshot command module after his mission Herman Kerble became the first Kerbol to set foot on Minimus 4 months later.KSP is worth every penny I paid for it.",62 followers,Jonathan Miller,672,854,3.4M,https://www.quora.com/Would-a-complex-computer-that-doesnt-need-to-display-anything-need-an-OS
7,Is Kerbal space program a waste of money?I would say it’s a good use of your money. Yeah it looks like a kids game but what it does is great you get a better idea on how orbits work. How rockets work and how hard it is to do really anything in space.You can fail and try again and when you do whatever goal you set you feel great. Add in the mods and you can size everything to something a bit more real. Such as time has to pass before you can fire that new rocket or before you need to make a burn to slow down your payload (Rocket).

Baron argues the uncertainties regarding Arctic land set the stage for a possible war. Formerly thick, unbreakable ice, climate change has reduced the Arctic to retreating glaciers and melting ice. There is still no land, but there’s now more water for ships to move—and drill for oil. The U.S., Canada, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Russia, and Sweden all have a physical stake in the 3-million-square-mile region, and while it’s governed by international law, there’s nothing that says countries must obey that law. “The race to create new technologies to explore commercial gains in the Arctic should never fall out of the news cycle. Decisions made in one country about what to employ in the region could affect the entire world. Furthermore, technology once used for biological and geological research can easily become co-opted for military and commercial gain. This dual-use dilemma is something researchers may not have previously considered,” Baron writes.Your Digital TwinHave you ever wished you were a twin? Your mother may not have been able to make that happen, but a binary code can. A digital twin is a virtual copy of you that can be analyzed without your presence. Combined with personalized medicine, a digital twin is a gigantic step forward for human health. For example, an analysis of your digital twin could predict weeks or months in advance if you’re heading for a heart attack. Of course, it can also do the opposite: unauthorized and unethical experiments could be performed on your twin without your knowledge—and anything with a binary code is open to hacking.MIT’s Version of “Inception”This year, MIT researchers debuted Dormio, a sleep-tracking device that can alter dreams by tracking hypnagogia and then delivering audio cues based on incoming physiological data, at precise times in the sleep cycle, to make dream direction possible. For example, before sleeping, you choose a theme like “rabbits,” and then, once you begin sleeping, sounds associated with this theme are used to a) remind you of the theme at targeted times and b) suspend you in early sleep stages, so you can still hear the sound even as you dream. According to the researchers, upon awakening, a person’s guided dream content can be used to complete tasks such as creative story writing, and compared experimentally to waking thought content. But what if a person’s dream is something illegal, even deadly? And what if someone nefarious got ahold of your Dormio? Hello nightmares and possible psychological trauma.Robot AbuseDo you say sorry to inanimate objects if you run into them? Some people do, more out of reflux than anything. But what if the object was a robot that could walk and talk and, overall, act like a human? You would think most people would definitely be nice to it then, but it turns out “robot abuse” is a common thing. Humans all over the world have been caught mercilessly harming robots “for fun.” Then again, does it matter if we hurt a robot since it’s not a living thing? Baron poses a series of questions that we may not have the answers to right now, but raise some incredibly interesting points for the future: “Should there be rules, or even laws protecting [robots] from deliberate harm? If we abuse them, what does that say about us? And will allowing people to abuse robots lead to more aggression, perhaps against humans or animals? But perhaps the most important question is: is it truly immoral to mistreat a robot?”“Stalkerware” AppsReports of domestic abuse and family violence have increased around the world since social isolation and quarantine measures came to be. Some states in the U.S. have reported an increase in domestic abuse incidents by more than 40%. As victims are resigned to stay in place with their abusers, “stalkerware” surveillance apps have made matters worse. Stalkerware apps, which relay private information including location, photos, audio, browser and messaging history, are easy to install on someone’s phone—and they hide in plain sight. It’s difficult enough for victims to escape their abusers, only to find out they are still being tracked by their phone, which is often considered a lifeline.The Data Void Left by Search EnginesIt’s rare for a search engine to spit out a small amount of information when you search for something, but it can happen. When there is little to no relevant information on a specific topic, it’s called a “data void.” A data void by itself if not negative; the problem occurs when humans step in. Once people find and/or predict a data void, they create webpages and resources to exploit the void, redirecting searches to sites with anything from ads and viruses to conspiracy theories and misinformation. You can’t believe everything you read on the internet, and yet, a lot of people do. “Once it’s on the Internet, it becomes fodder for everyone from talk radio hosts to angry people who spend all day on social media sharing stories and videos that reinforce their view of the world,” Baron said.Telemedicine—For SomeIf you had a telemedicine appointment with your doctor during COVID-19, you are in good company. Before the pandemic, only 1% of medical appointments were done virtually. At the height of COVID-19, more than 50% of appointments were telemedicine. While that number is expected to decrease as the pandemic slows, the metaphorical cat is out of the bag and there’s no way to get him back in. For some, telemedicine is a fantastic option. “But the drawbacks include unequal access to healthcare among those without Internet access, untreated illnesses for those with conditions not conducive to telehealth, and clinician fatigue,” Baron explains. Additionally, as with most virtual medical situations, privacy concerns abound.App Profits off ForeclosuresThe unrelenting economic effects of COVID-19 caused many people to fall behind on their rent and mortgages. Of course, someone, somewhere, saw this as an opportunity. A “gig economy” app company developed Civvl, a service that contracts eviction crews to secure foreclosed residential properties. A spokesman for the company told CBS News, “Civvl is not actually carrying out evictions, but rather connecting independent junk haulers or contractors with opportunities to clear out property. It's basically like a job center. This is no different than you going on Monster Jobs - Job Search, Career Advice & Hiring Resources | Monster.com."" The app charges workers $35 a month to use the service on top of a 30% cut of their earnings. Many reviews accuse it of being a scam, taking a monthly fee but never connecting an individual to a job even though the app says the average is 6 jobs per day. Other reviews from non-users accuse the app of human rights violations and just not being nice: ""Attempting to profit off of human suffering is pure evil, especially during a global pandemic,"" one reviewer wrote.DoomscrollingLocal news used to (and still does) get a bad rep for constantly being negative—it’s all doom and gloom. Adults 50+ could easily escape the bad news when needed by turning off the television, or not picking up the newspaper. It’s different for today’s generation, though. Information from the entire world in in the palm of our hands—and it’s addictive. Doomscrolling (also called doomsurfing) is the act of constantly consuming negative online content to the detriment of your mental health. Baron notes the term has been around since at least 2018 but, for obvious reasons, 2020 took it to an extreme. The murder of George Floyd, BLM protests, COVID-19, the presidential election, the results of the presidential election—it was a tumultuous year that played right into the hands of doomscrolling.FacebookBaron included Facebook in the Tech Top 10 List even before multiple antitrust lawsuits were filed late last week. Does that mean she’s on to something? Possibly. The staggering amount of Facebook users— 2.45 billion monthly—is concerning when considering how many ethical violations and dilemmas the social media platform has been involved with in recent years. In 2018, U.N. human rights investigators concluded that Facebook played a key role in spreading hate speech in Myanmar that fueled a “military crackdown” that involved the mass killing and rape of refugees. Some have even called it a genocide. In the 2016 election, Russian trolls used Facebook to promote ads featuring conspiracy theories and misinformation that over 10 million people saw. In 2020, the platform is riddled with “fake news” and misinformation that they say they are trying to get under control. “The fact that we are so entangled in the platform that it would seriously affect our lives to close our accounts is a sign that we’re being manipulated. Facebook thinks it’s ‘neutral’ but also ‘moving in the right direction.’ That alone should make users wary of its ability to be a tool for good,” Baron writes.","14,826 followers",Krister Sundelin,880,23.7K,88.8M,https://www.quora.com/Would-a-complex-computer-that-doesnt-need-to-display-anything-need-an-OS

Sabin too never got a patent for it, in his case explicitly to stop commercial exploitation of pharmaceutical industries.Eventually, it almost led to the eradication of polio.Almost.It is still endemic in Afghanistan, Pakistan and Nigeria.

This is not just restricted to the party-boy Space Wolves or the violent Carcharodons and Flesh-Tearers. Marines of any chapter are very likely to see themselves as the Emperor’s hammer, and every problem as being a nail. This is a byproduct of the propaganda, indoctrination, and also experience. Some astartes have fought for centuries, and only fought, being supported in any other endeavor by chapter serfs, and allowing any part of their problem solving strategies to atrophy.Indeed, the less they think, the more they adhere to orders and regulations, the more they might be praised. This means that for all the intelligence they may have, astartes are just as likely to be dumb as stumps.Fortunately for astartes, since their brains have been enhanced, they do have the ability to learn and quickly. The issue may be whether they have the time and opportunity.So, while all astartes have the potential to be very intelligent, the actual intelligence varies from individual to individual.",0 followers,Nick Schanz,717,0,0,https://www.quora.com/Would-a-complex-computer-that-doesnt-need-to-display-anything-need-an-OS

Apparently he was some kind of early Spartan. If I’m getting this wrong, please correct (and teach) meSpartan 1:Spartan 1’s are like one step above normal soldiers. Nowhere near the powerhouses the 2’s are. Their Warhammer 40k equivalent would be an Imperial Guardsmen. Elite soldiers with special training that face the horrors of the galaxy and come out on top.Vs the might of the Space Marines.Let’s quickly go over the stats of the Space Marines:Ok now for the match ups:In 40k lore, a small squad of Guardsmen can kill a chaos space marine with little to no trouble. However this is due to their Lasgun rifles being stupidly powerful (when used properly) & the Guard having entire combat doctrines dedicated to fighting Space Marines.Spartan 1’s are no doubt skilled combatants. However their standard 7.62 rifles are not able to penetrate even the weakest Astartes armor, nor would they have any training or readiness for the combat situation.I believe it would take anywhere from 20–30 Spartan 1’s to take a Space Marine down. Whether it be one of them grabs a heavy weapon like a Rocket Launcher and the marine can’t dodge in time and gets hit. However even then the marine can take about 3 rockets before he drops. Of the 20–30 Spartans, I believe at least 15 of them will be killed in the process. However the marine may very well kill them all.Now for Spartan 2’s.I like to call these guys Mini Space Marines. VERY impressive soldiers.When comparing a Spartan 2 to a Space Marine, think of the Space Marine’s stats but worse. Space Marines are bigger, stronger, smarter, (sometimes) faster, their armor and weapons are FAR superior.I believe it would take 4–5 Spartan 2’s to take down a Space Marine, my reason for this (for that one idiot that’s gonna leave a comment going “NO A SINGLE SPARTAN 2 CAN LITERALLY KILL EVERY SPACE MARINE EVER REEEEEEEEE” )Yeah sure and Master Chief can kill the Emperor.Anyway, Let’s take the fight with Atriox in Halo Wars 2.3 Spartan 2’s got their asses annihilated by this guy. Atriox only letting them go for… plot? I think he was looking for their base or something idkThe point is Atriox toyed with them, taunted them, let them go. A Space Marine wouldn’t do any of those things. First and foremost, Space Marines would shit on Atriox. I made a post about that a while ago if anyone wants to find the question.Secondly, as said, the Marine wouldn’t waste his time with talk, or staring down his foes. The Spartans would not have gotten the chance to gain their bearings or even comprehend what is going on. Placing a Marine in place of Atriox, the fight would’ve lasted seconds at most.So with that in mind, also realize Spartan 2’s have the same issue the 1’s have. Their standard issue rifles would have no effect on the marine’s armor. They’d have to punch, kick, and use anti tank weaponry like the Spartan Laser & Rocket Launcher to kill the marine.Assuming 6 Spartans meet the marine in a fight, I believe they would take him down. However I also believe at least 1/2 of those Spartans would die.As powerful as the 2’s are, they’re no match for the Space Marines.As for the 3’s:They’re downgraded 2’s. Same issues with the weapons, to keep it quick:10 Spartan 3’s meet the marine, I think at least 5 of them would die. Maybe closer to 6–7.Conclusion:Spartans are VERY powerful soldiers. They’re very cool soldiers! But you gotta remember 2 things:1: Halo is a universe about humanity’s last stand. Spartans were made to give humanity a chance against a relentless onslaught(shut up about the real purpose of Spartans I don’t care about the rebellions)2: In Warhammer 40k, humanity IS the relentless onslaught. Space Marines are made to kill Aliens twenty stories high, demons, and god like beings.Of course the Spartan’s aren’t gonna stand a chance. They’re not supposed to! That doesn’t make Spartans weak, it’s just that Space Marines are so over the top and wacky that it’s not even fair comparing the two.",UNKNOWN,Michael B.,649,6.4K,75.8M,https://www.quora.com/Is-Kerbal-space-program-a-waste-of-money

22,"Considering that we are still only typically using 46-bit computers…No, not a typo.Let me explain what these bits mean. Memory in a computer is accessed using an address. Each address represents a byte. There is data at byte 0, at byte 1, at byte 2, … etc.When the computer’s processor requests data from the computer’s operative memory (RAM), it has to provide an address. A single electrical wire can have two states: off and on. That can correspond to byte 0 and byte 1. Two wires can have four states in total, addressing byte 0 through byte 3 in memory. And so on.Back in the good ole’ days, comConsidering that we are still only typically using 46-bit computers…No, not a typo.Let me explain what these bits mean.

A single electrical wire can have two states: off and on. That can correspond to byte 0 and byte 1. Two wires can have four states in total, addressing byte 0 through byte 3 in memory. And so on.Back in the good ole’ days, computers had 16-bit addresses. That means a total of 65536 memory locations (64 kilobytes). That was a lot back, say, in 1980, but not today.So there came 32-bit addresses, and for a while we were doing just fine. In fact, at first, processors that internally handled 32-bit addresses only had, say, 20 or 24 wires to access physical memory. With 20 wires, a total of 1,048,576 bytes (a megabyte) can be addressed. With 24 wires, it goes up to 16 megabytes.Now 16 megabytes was a Big Deal in, say, 1988. But soon, we had computers with hundreds of megabytes of memory, so now processors provided a full set of 32 address wires. This made it possible to access up to 4,096 megabytes (4 gigabytes) of RAM. That was good for a while… but not today.So we need more address bits. Going from 32-bit to 64-bit, that is. But do we really need 64-bit addresses? Not anytime soon. We are not exactly in need of 17,179,869,184 gigabytes of memory. Sure, the total amount of computer RAM in the world is a lot more than that, but individual computers rarely have more than a few dozen gigabytes of RAM even today, in 2019.Processor makers are aware of this, and know that there is no point providing a full set of 64 address wires in modern processors. That’s why a typical Intel processor “only” has 46 such wires, even though it internally treats addresses as 64-bit. Even with 46 wires, a processor can address 65,536 gigabytes, or 64 terabytes of RAM. That is still a lot more than the largest hard disk drive, so we are okay for now.Will we ever need more than 64 address bits, though? Perhaps. Will computers ever have more than 16,777,216 terabytes (that is, 16 exabytes) of memory? Sounds like an outrageous amount of RAM, but it wasn’t that long ago that 16 gigabytes sounded outrageous, too. Yet today, there are smartphones with this much memory. (I am talking about operative memory, not persistent storage.) So yes, I am pretty sure that in the next few decades, barring world wars, killer asteroids, or bioweapons gone berserk, we will have processors capable of addressing more than 16 exabytes of RAM.Will that mean a switch to 128-bit addresses? Now that, I do not know. While bigger addresses offer the ability to more RAM, they also make programs ever so slightly bigger and ever so slightly slower. And there are other ways to address additional memory. In any case, even if 128-bit internal address representations become common, it does not mean that processors will have 128 address wires. After all, a mere 80 address wires already allow accessing more than a million exabytes (that would be a yottabyte) of RAM. And for all I know, by the time this happens, we may have a brand new paradigm in computing.By way of past examples, as recently as 2000 or thereabouts, people were predicting that soon, we’ll have processors running at clock speeds of several ten gigahertz. That didn’t happen. Such processors would have been immensely hard to manufacture and would produce copious quantities of waste heat. Instead, we ended up with processors containing multiple processing cores. Perhaps something similar will happen with memory: Instead of providing one ginormous contiguous address space, future computers may divide up physical memory among a large number of processor cores, effectively creating a miniature computer network on chip. Or maybe instead of having as many addressing wires as there are address bits, address information would be communicated by other means, much like the switch, not too long ago, from the “PATA” parallel interface that was used to access hard disk drives to the serial “SATA” interface employing much fewer wires.For now though, we’re a long way away from exhausting the capabilities offered by 64 address bits. Remember: a typical Intel processor is really only a 46-bit processor, as it has only 46 address wires that can be used to connect the processor to memory.By the way, a full 128-bit address can access 281,474,976,710,656 yottabytes of memory.","1,135 followers",Wim ten Brink,2.2K,2.2K,5.9M,https://www.quora.com/Is-Kerbal-space-program-a-waste-of-money
