This is because of the services that they provide today. This is the major reason why the Big Four Firms are becoming ‘too big to fall’, the reason why Price Waterhouse Coopers still holds strong globally, even after the Satyam scam and many more unheard cases. An organisation organises itself in such a way to make provision of services easier and therefore, understanding the departmental structure is the best way of understanding the nature of services.The structure is a little complex and unique, owing to the Service-oriented business catering variety of services across various industries.The classification in the Big Four firms is a little complex and you are not just known by your department but also the industry you work in and the services that you provide. So a person is known by his Service Line, Industry, Sub-industry sector, Department, Location and the Designation.E.g. Rahul Desai (Manager, Assurance - Auditing, Mumbai, A&T - Transportation)Here, Rahul works inThe following flowchart will explain the usual structure of Big Four FirmsUsual Service Lines -These departments are further divided into various categories as you can see in the image as well.Usual Service Industries -At the same time, the Big Four firms are also further divided into various industries. This is a recent change and while some firms have already completed it, some are in the transition phase.Each of these industries is further categorized into various sub-sectors e.g. Technology, Media and Telecommunication would have three sub-sectors as it appears in the name. The sub-sectors are not very strict, a person may be involved in different sub-sectors, however, the service industry remains the same in all cases.Assurance Services -This is where the most of the Chartered Accountants work and CA Students work as it is a legal requirement for the purpose of auditing. However, the assurance department is not exclusively about Auditing. Areas like Accounting Advisory,The major subdivisions are:Taxation Services -This is also a department where the majority of employees have Chartered Accountant qualification, however, the number of Articled trainees is very low as compared to the Auditing department.The major subdivisions are:Advisory Services -This a department where people from different educational backgrounds work together to provide all kinds of services. This is the most growing sector of the Big Four firms and definitely the biggest source of revenues for the firms. The auditing clients are lured into these services so that even after rotation, the firm can still generate revenue on the basis of relations developed.The major subdivisions are:Transaction Advisory Services -This service line does not regularly deal with the client, it only provides one time services in relation to specific changes that are occurring in the company. However, these are important transactions and therefore, the company seeks professional pieces of advice which this department provides, from the Financial angle.Business Support Services -This department does not provide any services to external clients, but this is just the administration wing of the Big Four Firms. There are so many departments, offices and employees in the company, and thereby, so many needs of each department. This is a central department (at each location) which helps the functioning of all the other departments mentioned above.So just like a normal company has Finance department, Human Resources department, Procurement department, etc. the Big Four firms also have these departments.ConclusionBig Four Firms are big, very big! Not sure if ‘too big to fall’, still they are mammoth firms which ensure their survival very well. Their competition isn’t with the local firms, that would be an absolute misconception. The way these firms have widened the scope of their services, while they provide opportunities to the professionals from various backgrounds, they also pose a threat to the business of the existing companies providing those services.","44,247 followers",Kurt Guntheroth,1.3K,13.7K,166.9M,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-puzzle-questions-with-which-I-can-confuse-the-lawyer-or-any-LLB-student-How-can-I-check-the-ability-of-a-lawyer-or-LLB-student-by-asking-a-question

Send your best on campus to attract the best and then treat them well as interns and full-time employees to build a virtuous circle and brand. Great engineers will recognize the privilege in helping to recruit and select their future coworkers.There is an adage in the college recruiting business that goes something like: ""be careful who you send on campus because it is likely you will get more of them back."" It really comes down to people and one on one contactSo many large companies send hiring managers on campus who are just way too distanced from the day to day engineering experience and can't speak the language or really answer questions that prospective students have about the job or technology.In a prior life I set up IBM's Extreme Blue internship program where I could leverage a brand and incredible resources. More recently I ran engineering at a startup for 5 years. After a year of professional hires, I went back to offering internships and converting them into full-time employees both to add experience diversity but also I found that college hires much more malleable and can be coached/mentored to excellence than many more experienced developers set in their ways.In both cases, my on campus strategy is to partner with student group or career services to do technical presentations related to something we are doing of general interest or some new development practice or methodology. I would send prominent IBM engineers and fellows back to their alma maters and local schools. I also leveraged all the IBM research grants to talk to professors and pitch them on lending us some of their best students for the summer to work in an area outside their research focus and we will return them with a greater perspective. Occasionally I might do a career development presentation, i.e. difference between commercial development and academics, choosing between working and graduate school. I will give basically a very short elevator pitch for the company and mention we are actively hiring. That's it.The important thing is to build a brand as a great place to work. In the IBM internship case, we made sure the work was both ""sexy"" meaningful but also expose the interns to the diversity that is IBM. Great people, great resources, great culture. At my startup it was really make an immediate impact and we care about you and your career growth, i.e. you will get more done here than anywhere else.In the case of IBM, Extreme Blue started at the top undergraduate 10 CS schools in the US. In the case of the startup we hit the local University and some community colleges. You can find great talent at most places, some places are just more target rich and competitive. You also have to decide how much you want to spend to develop potential talent as opposed to compete for established talent. More established companies tend to go after established talent or students closer to graduation, so smaller organizations might want to go after that talent earlier and help develop it.I forgot after reading some other answers, under what not to do: don't hound students by phone early in the morning. One very prominent startup of its time kept trying to call to recruit me at 8a. Needless to say I never called them back. Email is the norm, phone should be reserved for interviews.",56 followers,Christopher F Clark,5.6K,9.2K,22.2M,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-puzzle-questions-with-which-I-can-confuse-the-lawyer-or-any-LLB-student-How-can-I-check-the-ability-of-a-lawyer-or-LLB-student-by-asking-a-question

The presentation wasn't specifically about software engineering jobs, but students from all majors were welcome to attend.I have never seen a response to a corporate presentation that was anything near what I witnessed that day. Though the maximum occupancy of the presentation room was around 50 students, over 100 people showed up! The career services liaison met me a few minutes before I was slated to begin, and impressed upon me just how excited the SJSU students were to speak with me. Extra security guards were brought in to keep order and prevent congestion outside the door. Whenever I paused during the presentation, a dozen hands shot up immediately. It took me 30 minutes to get through all of the students who stayed afterwards to introduce themselves to me, and by the time I returned to my apartment at the end of the day I had 40 resumes in my work inbox. I still get 1 or 2 new resumes a week from them, even though it's been over three months since my visit.This was especially noteworthy (to me at least) because I had just given a similar presentation at [nearby prestigious private university] the day before, which only drew about 20 mostly disinterested attendees and barely any follow-up.Now, San Jose State certainly isn't Caltech -- but Dell isn't Palantir or MemSQL, either[1]. Not only were these students smart, eager, and well-informed, but you should have seen their resumes! Talk about a talented and accomplished engineering student body. Not to mention that SJSU is a commuter school, which means that plenty of their students juggle commuting and work responsibilities in addition to their schoolwork. The work ethic of these students was very obvious. If you can picture a cushy, coddled, entitled group of students at a quote-unquote ""smart"" school, that's entirely the opposite of what these kids are all about. I was very, very impressed.Not to mention that they would haveSo, the questioner asked about the best strategy for hiring talented software engineers. My answer is toQuestions like this exist because Stanford engineers are high in demand and low in supply. Try going somewhere where supply is high and demand is low. You'll find that engineering talent is often a mis-priced asset.(NOTE: My point isn't that students at prestigious universities are coddled; obviously, the stories of Caltech/MIT student work ethic are legendary[2]. What I'm saying is that there is a lot of great, eager talent at programs outside of the top 10 or 25 or 50 that can be acquired with vastly less effort on the part of the hiring company. If you show up on their campus prepared to make a few hires, you won't need a ""strategy"" to convince anybody to join your firm.)[1][2]",168 followers,Vladimir Katardjiev,2.6K,93,1.1M,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-different-departments-in-the-Big-Four-EY-PwC-KPMG-Deloitte-and-what-do-they-do

We’d assign him work and he’d make a host of excuses why the deadline was unreasonable or the work was crappy design.Anyway I finally decided to pair program with him. This required me sitting next to someone I didn’t really care for, so it took some effort. We fired up the IDE and he froze. I’d prompt him along but he just didn’t seem to get it.Finally I asked “I get the feeling you don’t want to do this work”.Jim: “I don’t, it sucks, I don’t understand it and everyone is going so fast I can’t keep up.”Me: “What would you prefer to do?”Jim: “Reports, I really like doing Crystal Reports.”Me: Aha!For those of you not familiar with Crystal Reports, they are awful and are universally abhorred by serious developers. This guy Jim had mastered how to work with this product, it was his niche.So rather than force him to learn something new we let him slide into a maintenance role and within days this guy was whistling, offering productive suggestions in daily standups and had completely changed his attitude. Even the CIO noticed “what the heck did you do with Jim? He’s a new person!”My tl;dr is this: everyone has a sweet spot, something they excel at. It is the manager’s job to find that sweet spot, not try to force a square peg into a round hole. If you hired a square peg then bad on you, it is now your job to fix it.

Chips that would go into routers and firewalls and other networking gear, but which would make Snort run faster. The first chip we designed was a bust. It did what we wanted, but it turns out the overhead to use it from the CPU was too high and thus despite processing the hits faster than the CPU did, the result was taking more time than it took the CPU to answer the question itself.Thus, we knew we had to build a complete regular expression offload engine. That was something I knew how to build. The question was exactly how should it work. A naive state machine model is very much constrained by memory access time. So, we developed some clever ways to avoid that.However, in this process, I was allowed to hire interns. So, I knew I wanted an intern that understood regular expressions and could contribute novel ideas to the process. I also knew I needed a person who could do more than regurgitate the standard algorithms.At that time, I was also helping run the embedded and communications university conference and also giving out grants to researchers. I had several universities that had contributed useful ideas and I had personal contacts with the professors there. So, I asked them if they had any students that were particularly well qualified. I got back two names that looked promising and three more that were at least potential. I realized that the two best candidates were not going to be easily picked between just by a one hour interview.As a result, I created a 3 page “take-home” exam that the candidates were allowed to do over the weekend. No restrictions. The first questions were fairly easy warm-ups but made sure that the candidates and I were using similar technology. By the end of the first page though, the people were actually designing and thinking about regular expression engines and how one might compress the tables to fit in a small memory space. The next two pages took that further with the final question basically asking them to solve a representation problem that wouldn’t be found in any textbook but I knew worked in parser generators (as I had used it myself in that capacity).Well, at the beginning of the second page, I made a slight error in the question I asked. Not enough of an error that the question was misleading, but one that showed a bias in how I was thinking. One of the candidates pointed that error out and showed how it could have made the problem trivial and then answered the question I intended to ask. The other promising candidate managed to solve that problem, but without that insight. Moreover, the one who pointed out the error was the only one who answered all the questions. Several of the candidates barely got even all the easy questions right. So, I knew I had my intern. Someone who could solve the problems that I was asking but also catch me when I made errors. I have known competent engineers in the field that couldn’t do that.Anyway, we offered her an internship. She was all that I was hoping for. She helped me solve problems that would have taken substantially longer had I done them on my own, if I even succeeded in solving them. Moreover, she had insights that were simply groundbreaking. I am happy simply that she includes me as a reference in a few of her papers. The ideas in them were her own. Obviously at the end of the internship, we offered her a full-time position at Intel. However, she wanted to stay in academia and is now a professor. When she asked me if I would take one of her students and get them a job at Intel, the answer was an unequivocal yes.She is definitely a case of the intern surpassing their mentor.If you want to read some papers that will give you insight into high speed regular expression matching, I heartily recommend reading Michela Becchi’s works on the topic.","58,986 followers",Michael Wolfe,671,2K,17.3M,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-best-strategy-for-hiring-talented-software-engineers-straight-out-of-college

These people have understood the problem completely and know several different ways to solve it. For them the programming language or technology stack used is insignificant in relation to actually solving the problem. In general, what I have seen is that those who only know the 'How' are in it for the short term. For the quick buck. Furthermore, these people will never give you a straight answer when shit hits the fan. Those who know the why are in it for the long term. They are involved for the right reasons. They are ready to adapt what ever technology resolves the problem efficiently for the long term. The How software engineers are normally the guys that come in a deploy a solution that works for a few weeks and then it breaks down. So you call them back in again. Rinse and repeat. The ‘why’ software engineers take longer because they want to understand the problem and it's context in it's entirety…but once they do…they normally deploy once and the solution works long term..many times changing the entire way business processes are done permanently. In many organizations, I have seen software solutions that do amazing stuff but once they are deployed…no one is using them. Why? When you dig deep…you find the reason is normally minor. E.g no internet in rural areas to access some hospital management system. Basically the 'how' software engineer just deployed his solution, got paid and walked away. He wasn't interested in getting people to actually use the software…he was there to get paid. I have seen this scenario 100 times over.",143 followers,Vijay Krishnan,775,108,357.3M,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-best-strategy-for-hiring-talented-software-engineers-straight-out-of-college

If you’re coding for say a laptop on ISS this is less true, but generally expect to be close to the hardware, or doing some kind of data analysis on weird raw data.Last, expect to spend at least four times as long documenting and characterizing your code as you do writing it.All this being said, it’s incredibly cool when something you helped write runs on another planet or in space for the first time, and it works just like it should.","224,568 followers",Gayle Laakmann McDowell,2.3K,1.2K,49.8M,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-best-strategy-for-hiring-talented-software-engineers-straight-out-of-college

You basically need three types of skills:-1. Qualification relatedSkill#1: Masters level educational qualificationThis might seem a bit weird, but if you research minutely, you'll find about 75% hold a masters in a hard natural science like Physics, Stat or applied math, and 15% hold a PhD, and 10% have Bachelors in CS.While programming proficiency you can earn by hands-on training and random practices, the capacity of understanding the advanced level stats associated with the data scientist job role is not an easily achievable entity.Skill#2: Statistical ProficiencyAs already mentioned, statistics is the key to a data scientist career success but in the data analytical format. So, you need to be knowledgeable enough about different theories and concepts of stats. Then, using this, you can combine the same to draw a solution at a light speed once you find a problem. Such concerts include2. Technical skillSkill#3: Python proficiency with adequate R knowledgeWhile python can solve most of the basic to intermediate level data science problems, a few advanced level problems need exclusive blends of both python and R. To be successful as a data scientist; you need to target such exclusive points.Skills#4: Database management applicationsJust think, you are working with piles of data without knowing database management tools. It's like driving a car without wheels. Although lighter and ready-made tools like mySQL and SQLite are there, you should be a master of handling SQL to reach the top level of success. Relational databases are the key resource of data science problems, and without adequate SQL knowledge, you can't proceed effectively.Skill#5: Big data tools- Apache Spark, Hadoop, and MongoDBBig data can be considered as the container of data science, AI and ML. You might be a pro of machine learning modelling, manual coding, python and even C/C++ - without big data skills, you are not at all an information scientist. Plenty of such tools are there. But at least the advanced level skills in the above mentioned three tools can save you from a messy professional disaster.Skill#6: Advanced level of ML or, better to say, Deep Learning (DL)It's not about the several ML algorithms only. Rather, you need to learn the core concepts ofSkill#7: Data imaging and interpretationPower BI, Tableau, Matplotlib are the most renowned tools in the field of data visualisations. However, I never recommend blindly mastering the working process of these tools. Obsobilulsy you need to get well habituated with the same but along with the working principles of the same. The tools get replaced over time, and so does the specialist, but once you track the core working principle, the adaptation of any tools will not be a concern for you.3. Non-technicalA perfect amalgamation of technical and non-technical data science skills can only make you a successful information scientist.Skill#8: The skill of interactionMost people call it 'communication skill', but I prefer calling it 'interaction'. Business communication associated with the written and verbal mode is quite easier than the data science associated interactive skill. You need to interact with every single person, every single internal and external stakeholder, to collect and investigate data. Even making all the team agree with your data interpretation is like winning the OSCAR award. You need to be skilled enough to negotiate with the other to get approved for the most cost-effective and reliable business solutions.The rest of the two skills are as follows:Skill#9 Business acumenSkill#10 Highbrowed oddityThere is nothing much to discuss about these two non-technical skills.I hope you got your answer. But if you are really interested in becoming a successful data scientist and have 2+ years of experience in any domain, I would additionally suggest theAnd last but not least, the courses are entitled to globally recognisedThe final word: To become a successful data scientist, you need to earn the skill with passion and with the help of the right guidance.

Thanks to machine learning and other big data technologies, it has become easier than ever before to get the data you need.What Is Data Science?Data science is an industry-level art and science that combines the best of mathematics with statistical analysis, computer programming languages, and quantitative research methods. The goal of data science is to extract knowledge such as insights, trends, and information through the analysis of massive amounts of data.Skills needed for data science:If you want to become a data scientist, it takes more than a good understanding of stats. Getting into this field also requires high-level technical skills. Data scientists can use tools like Python, C++, and Java to program algorithmic updates on their work and create programs from scratch. They may be required to set up servers and databases for the company they work for or even write code to link data to certain coding languages.1. Python:The preferred programming language for data science. Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language. In other words, Python programs are created using plain English syntax that the computer interprets. It is also known as a dynamic, open-source programming language and can be used on many different platforms, including Linux and Microsoft Windows.2. SQL:The standard programming language for accessing relational databases. SQL is a special-purpose language that allows you to manage, organize and access data from relational databases to perform queries, create reports and manipulate data. With this skill, you can create programs that interact with these structures.3. Statistics:Statistics allows you to use math formulas to collect, count, analyze and present data. Statistics is a specialized subject that only applies to specific uses. When working with statistics, you are most likely using Statistics software designed specifically for analyzing data to extract knowledge from the information. The average human being can relate statistics to things like percentages, numbers, or arithmetical calculations.Are these skills enough to get a job as a Data Scientist?It's critical to choose aSo, where can you get these domain-specific modules and skills?A few of the greatest platforms provideSome of the top data science platforms to acquire these skills are as follows:I recommendThese courses will teach you how to use tools like regression analysis and classification methods like logistic regression and naive Bayes classifier to create prediction models. If you want a thorough introduction to machine learning,These courses will teach you how to use charts, graphs, and dashboards to read and visualize data. Along with the basicBest Institute with Domain electives:Learnbay is another great ed-tech platform to get you started with data science.These courses include the following projects:The student who wants to become a data scientist must learn by doing. In order to get a position as a data scientist in a firm, a student must have experience working on real-world and capstone projects. These projects are critical to your development as a professional.Conclusion:Data science is a challenging, fascinating career that combines the use of statistics, programming, and business knowledge. It's a highly sought-after job opportunity with companies such as Facebook, Uber, LinkedIn, and Amazon among many other businesses seeking out data scientists to work for them. As an ambitious data scientist, you must work hard and be mentored in order to develop the necessary skills.

This can be many things but to me the most significant part is the design and analysis of experiments which allows to assess the data products we create.#3 Machine LearningI isolated machine learning from the previous point because the process of creating a machine learning based data product is a world in its own. Knowing programming and knowing statistics, even if one knows how to fit statistical models is not sufficient to create such a data product.It is true that at its core machine learning algorithms are not fundamentally different from many of the algorithms used in statistics. However the application differs, namely the concerns with performance, especially in real time applications and feature engineering.#4 SkepticismThe more I work in data science, the more skeptic I become. I believe skepticism is underrated and undervalued. According to WikipediaScientific skepticism (also spelled scepticism) is the practice of questioning whether claims are supported by empirical research and have reproducibility, as part of a methodological norm pursuing ""the extension of certified knowledge"".Always, ALWAYS,#5 CommunicationCommunication is a lot more than most people say. Most people think of communication as the way for data scientist to show their findings to other people which leads to visualisation and presentation skills to be high on lists like this. I believe that is tremendously short-sighted.Communication is a lot more than that:Communication is in one hand overrated, on the other hand underrated.

Below is one such cartoon, just for fun.Finding an 'effective' data scientist is hard and finding people who understand who a data scientist is equally hard. Note the use of 'effective' here, I use it to highlight that there could be people who might possess some of these skills yet may not be the best fit in a data science role. Irony is that even the people looking for hiring data scientists do not know who a data scientist is. Hiring managers post job descriptions for traditional data analyst and business analyst roles while the title calling it a 'Data Scientist' role.Everything that I say below is my experience working in a data scientist role with a major search engine and advertising platform. Instead of giving a bullet list of skills, I would first highlight the difference between some data related roles.Consider the following scenario. Shop-Mart and Bulk-Mart are two competitors in selling retail. Some higher up in the management chain asks this question: ""How many Shop-Mart customers also go to Bulk-Mart?"".[Please note that the question might be of interest to Bulk-Mart management or even a third party, possibly a market research or consumer behavior company, interested in shopping behavior of the population.]Here is how different data-related roles will approach the problem. ThisTraditional BI/Reporting Professional:Data Analyst:Business Analyst:Data Mining or Big Data Engineer:Statistician (A traditional one):Program/Project Manager:Now putting it altogether.The rise of online services has brought a paradigm shift in software development life cycle and how business iterate over successive features and products. Having a different data puller, analyst, statistician and project manager is just now possible any more. The mantra now is ship, experiment and learn, adapt, ship, experiment and learn .... This situation has resulted in the birth of a new role - ' A Data Scientist'A data scientist should have the skills of all the individuals I have mentioned so far. In addition to the skills mentioned above, a data scientist should have rapid prototyping and programming, machine learning, visualization and hacking skills.Domain Knowledge and Soft Skills Are As Important as Technical Skills:All of what I have said above is based on my own tenure as a data scientist at a major search engine and later the advertising platform within the same company. I learnt that sometimes people asking the question may not know what they want to know - sounds preposterous - yet happens way too often. Very often a bozo will start rat holing into something that is not related to the issue at hand - just to prove that he/she is relevant. A data scientist encounters such HIPPOS (Highly Paid Person's Opinion) that are somewhat unrelated to the problem if not complete nonsense very often. A data scientist should posses the right soft skills to manage situations where people ask irrelevant, distracting or outside of scope questions. This is hard, especially in situations where the person asking the question is several levels up in the corporate ladder and is known to have an ego. It is a data scientist's responsibility to manage up and around while presenting and communicating insights.Below is a summary of necessary skills a data scientist should possess in my opinion.Curiosity About Data and Passion for Domain:Soft Skills:Being a good story teller is also something that helps. Sometimes the insights obtained from data are counter-intuitive, if you are not a good story teller, it will be difficult to convince your audience.Math/Theory:CS/Programming:Big Data and Distributed Systems:Visualization:Below is a visualization of high level description of skills needed to become a data scientist.Where is a data scientist in the big data pipeline?To be continued .....",331 followers,Shairoz Sohail,1.2K,0,0,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-different-departments-in-the-Big-Four-EY-PwC-KPMG-Deloitte-and-what-do-they-do
22,"It’s a bit hard to summarize the whole field into 5 skills (especially since the job “data scientist” means different things at different companies), but I’ll give a shot here. These five skills are roughly ordered from the “hard skills” to “soft skills”.Skill #1: ProgrammingThis is perhaps the MOST fundamental of a data scientist’s skill set - the job of a data scientist is much more applied than that of a traditional statistician. Programming is important in multiple ways, including the three below:It’s a bit hard to summarize the whole field into 5 skills (especially since the job “data scientist” means different things at different companies), but I’ll give a shot here.

Programming is important in multiple ways, including the three below:The normal software engineering training here will help you develop programming skills (although you typically don’t have to go as far as a usual software engineer would).Skill #2: Quantitative analysisQuantitative analysis is heart of a data scientist’s skill set. Much of data science is about understanding the behavior of a particularly complex system by analyzing the data that it produces, both naturally and via experiments. The need for quantitative analysis skills are important in multiple ways, including the three below:The requirement of this skill is why in particular the data science field is attractive to 1. Physicists 2. Statisticians 3. Economists 4. Operations Researchers 5. Many more, who are very used to understanding complex systems through top-down approaches (making models) or bottom-up approaches (inferences from data).Skill #3: Product intuitionProduct intuition as a skill is tied to a data scientist’s ability to perform quantitative analysis on the system. Product knowledge means understanding the complex system that generates all of the data that data scientists analyze. This is incredibly important for quite a few reasons, including:Product knowledge usually involves using the product that your company is creating. If that’s not possible, then at least trying to get to know the people who actually use the product.Skill #4: CommunicationThis skill is important to help significantly increase the leverage of all of the previous skills listed. This one is particularly important and can help distinguish a good data scientist from a great one. Good communication can manifest in various ways, including:Skill #5: TeamworkThis last skill ties together the rest of the 4 skills. A data scientist in particular cannot exist in isolation, and from what I’ve seen does best when deeply embedded in the rest of the company (or at least within the product development org).Teamwork is important for many reasons, including:ConclusionThe first two skills: programming and quantitative analysis are perhaps what most people first think about when they think about the skills of a data scientist.
