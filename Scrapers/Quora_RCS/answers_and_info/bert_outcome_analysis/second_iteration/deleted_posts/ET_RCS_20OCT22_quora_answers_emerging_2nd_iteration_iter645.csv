There is no question at all: the US had the technology to land on the Moon and it sent astronauts to the Moon and they landed on the Moon, walked and drove on the Moon, brought back rocks from the Moon, and left devices and spacecraft on the Moon which are still there today.I don’t just think this - I know it to be true.I watched Neil Anderson and Buzz Aldrin walk on the Moon, July 20 1969, on television.

I have seen the Saturn V rockets that were used myself though I never saw a launch. I have seen some of the space capsules that were actually used in the Mercury, Gemini and Apollo programs.But, hundreds of thousands of people did actually see those rockets launch from Cape Canaveral, that carried men to the Moon. Over 400,000 people and 20,000 companies were working directly on the Apollo Program. It was all completely real. You would have been laughed to derision had you suggested at the time that it was fake, and in fact no one ever did suggest that, because it was so obviously a real effort that was being closely watched by everyone.We didn’t doubt it in the US when Yuri Gagarin orbited the Earth. Well, actually I was very little then, and my family hadn’t yet moved to the US to live, but NOBODY doubted that Yuri Gagarin had orbited the Earth. It was because of that that President Kennedy launched the effort to reach the Moon. He wanted the US to be first at something in the space race. It was well known that the Russians had an active effort under way to reach the Moon first, and actually, when Apollo 11 landed there was already a Russian unmanned probe on the lunar surface. It was an enormous international competition.Now what technology exactly do you think it was that the US lacked in 1969?Do you think John Glenn never replicated Yuri Gagarin’s accomplishment?The whole “the moon landings were faked” conspiracy theory was invented in order to sell a book written by an English major and a former member of the US Navy: a man employed as a technical writer, and a man who knew bugger all about rockets or aerospace technology. He simply wanted to make a buck. He started out by writing a small pamphlet but quickly found that there was a market of nut jobs willing to pay for his nonsense. And that is the beginning of this whole utterly idiotic theory, that it appears millions of people buy into.The book was calledDo the people who buy into this also think that World War II was a hoax? I mean, where is the actualHere’s a far, far better question to ask:The answer is obviously no, for anyone who has any knowledge of how films and special effects were being made in those days.And no, Stanley Kubrick himself could not have done it.

1,"Since anybody who has objectively considered the case of Apollo 11 knows, in 1969 the US landed two men on the moon and successfully returned the whole mission to earth. That would indicate that beyond a shadow of reasonable doubt, the USA had the technology to land on the moon in 1969.If you want to talk about unreasonable doubt, we could say that the Apollo 11 mission was a fake because they didn’t find a rabbit pounding magic medicine.

Everyone who’s capable of objectively considering the available genuine evidence KNOWS without a shadow of a doubt that the USA had the technology to land two astronauts on the Moon in 1969 — because it DID, and it repeated that technological feat FIVE more times in the period to 1972, until idiots in power cancelled Project Apollo, the most audacious and spectacular human accomplishment since the invention of the flint axe.The two main idiots were a bumbling crook called Tricky Dicky (a.k.a.

Richard Milhous Nixon, 37th president of the USA) and Tom Otten Paine (3rd administrator of NASA), who thought it was a good idea to free up money for the development of two white elephants called ‘space shuttle’ and ‘space station’. Both those projects turned out to be enormously cash-guzzling and effectively killed the USA’s manned exploration of space beyond low Earth orbit. Apart from the amazing Hubble Space Telescope, all that humanity seems to have gained from humans in space since that idiotic decision is videosYour question is like asking whether France had the technology to build the Eiffel Tower in 1887-1889. The only rational response is to objectively consider the available evidence: (1) The tower exists; (2) We have plenty of photographs and first-hand testimony of the building process.Now, Eiffel Tower hoaxnuts who have never been to Paris — because they spend the greatest part of their meaningless lives staring at computer screens in dimly lit basements in Small Town USA — might claim that that impressive edifice as well as all the photographs and testimony thereof are “fake”. They might also claim that anyone who claims the contrary is a “shill” paid by the evil French government to deceive the “sheeple”.How are we to deal with such people, who are so determined to be and remain hoaxnuts? Should we ignore them as irrelevant distractions, should we try to change their minds by presenting them with cogent arguments for and compelling evidence of the tower’s reality, or should we send them to Paris to see for themselves? Even if we did that, they might stand between those four imposing iron feet and continue to whine “it’s fake”, so attached are they to their ludicrous delusion.Back to Project Apollo:Those six Apollo lunar exploration missions landed 12 astronauts on the Moon, who brought a total of 382 kg of Moon rock and regolith to Earth. Since then, independent interdisciplinary teams of scientists in numerous countries have analysed Apollo lunar samples generously provided by NASA and have found them to be authentically of lunar origin.Now, the hoaxnuts — who are NOT capable of objectively considering the available genuine evidence — claim that NASA didn’t get those rocks directly from the lunar surface but from the Antarctic ice-sheet.That’s nonsense for two reasons: (1) the total mass of all Antarctic lunar meteorites ever collected is far less than 382 kg, and (2) lunar meteorites have ‘fusion crusts’ (i.e. the outer layer is melted and charred due to frictional and ram-pressure heating during the rocks’ fall through Earth’s atmosphere) whereas no Apollo Moon rock has a fusion crust, for obvious reasons.This is just one example of how the ludicrous and risible claims of the ignorant and deluded — or, in some cases, delusional — hoaxnuts can easily be demolished by applying simple logic and science.Those who find the hoaxnuts’ claims compelling and themselves become hoaxnuts achieve Triple F status: they are fools fooled by fools.","4,807 followers",Steve Dutch,2.2K,22.7K,26.7M,https://www.quora.com/Do-you-think-the-USA-had-the-technology-to-land-on-the-moon-in-1969

When they unite in a common goal there is nothing they can’t accomplish.I lived through the space race, moon landings and then watched it all go down the toilet when the political will was lost to go further. The sixties were the most exciting years I’ve witness and it wasn’t the free love and LSD for me (I was 13 eh?).

9,"I think I am qualified to offer an answer as I was one of them back in 1982-83.No, we didn't write good games. I would not even call them mediocre. But we were there in the beginning, using hand-crafted assembler code to implement things like a 3D slab of ice wobbling in the arctic ocean or even the moving horizon of a flight simulation game.

Our first tool of the trade was an inline assembler that was really just a debugging tool from Commodore; the promised macro assembler has not yet shipped.How skilled were we? Less skilled than we thought! Everything was new. We were learning on the job. For instance, I learned from fellow team members with industrial automation experience that there exist incredible algorithms (Bresenham's algorithm and variants) that allow us to draw, e.g., that slab of ice or that moving horizon in real time with a reasonable refresh rate. I learned from another team member, good friend (who, sadly, passed away many years ago) the art of handling a soldering iron and using an oscilloscope, making sense of the timings of a system bus when a processor accesses DRAM or the memory is being refreshed. And I taught myself the basic concepts of time slice scheduling, writing an interrupt-driven kernel that would play back (with accurate timing) a music score through the C64's sound chip while executing different parts of the game in a round robin process.There is something to be said about programming a computer with so little memory, you can have a decent mental model of its entire physical address space. (A comparable present-day experience would be programming low-end microcontrollers like a PIC.) Back then, an assembler program of a few hundred lines was considered ""large"" (all uncommented of course. Comments are so lame, a waste of precious RAM or floppy disk space.) Debugging misbehaving code often involved dumping ALL the contents of the RAM and then searching for clues by visually inspecting the dump.We had loads of fun! But skilled? I am looking at what people have accomplished since those early days using the same 8-bit hardware. A graphical operating system with a mouse. A text-based browser and an HTTP server using a network adapter attached to the C64 extension port. Animation that puts our early attempts at 3D visuals to shame. Even freaking video playback with sound; low quality of course, but still. Talk about skilled.Of course it's always easier to do things in hindsight. Once you know what computers are capable of, once you learn extremely efficient algorithms, you can push them to the limit as you backport them to ancient hardware. Back then we didn't know what was possible. We were exploring limits even as we were dreaming about a future when these wonderful computers might have more storage (for instance, we calculated that when used as a data storage medium, a VHS cassette, for instance, could have stored several MEGABYTES!) or even be interconnected through the telephone network using these newfangled acoustic couplers, modems, at the blazing speed of 300 bits a second...",UNKNOWN,Viktor T.

The C64 ran a 1MHz 6502, and there were a number of ICE’s for that CPU — but they were expensive, and not likely to be available except for people doing hardware development.The real problem was that you had such incredibly limited resources. You had 64KB (yeah, kilobytes) of RAM, and 20KB of ROM, which had a variety of entry pointsNote from this map that there are overlapping pieces - you might correctly assume that you can either use the CART ROM from 8000-BFFF, or you can use RAM, or. you can use RAM and BASIC… but not all three at the same time. That was hardware switched BTW - plug in a CART and it “won” the mapping. It was also software switched - if you weren’t running a BASIC program you could map that ROM out, giving another 8KB of RAM…Also note the panel to the right — where it says “COLOR RAM”, between D800 and DBFF? That was part of the video refresh RAM — drop bits in there, change the colors of the pixels on the screen. But not “bits” — bytes, actually nibbles. The screen was drawn in 25 rows of 40 characters each, and the lower four bits of each byte changed the color to one of 16 gradients for each block of pixels.The content of that block? That was way down in the SCREEN MEMORY block, from 0400–07FF, again a block of 1KB characters (actually 1000, but what’s 24 bytes between friends?)So, as alluded to inThe “cheat code” on this was that you didn’t have — couldn’t in fact — write individual pixels; you wrote characters, 8 x 8 bit glyphs coded in something calledSo… think about your graphic design process… you have to piece together a set of PETSCII glyphs that you can change color on to paint your image, you have to load that before you turn on the video, then as you update it, you have to punch in the updates for one row, which covers 8 lines of pixels, in 504 microseconds while the block of characters on the rows above you are scanning, retracing and blanking… which means you’ve got between 250 and 64 instructions, depending on what specific instructions you’re using… and that has to cover not only the character updates, but also the computation around what you’re updating and why.Got it??Super. Now consider this: you also don’t have hardly any space for this code. And you barely have a stack - 256 stack frames each of which can be 512 bytes. So what you’d consider “normal” subroutines?? Too slow. Too expensive. So you wound up writing (god help us all) non-reentrant code, with multiple entry points which you’d keep track of by bits in the code that you’d set and re-set as you went…Plus, there would typically be a couple of people working on different bits of code. And because actual addresses mattered — none of this “variable” bullshit, you knew the actual factual specific in-physical-memory address of important entry points and data values — you might find yourself fucked all of a sudden because something moved, and someone forgot to tell you. And sometimes, in addition to being annoying, it mattered, because alignment might be messed up, or you might be in a different memory frame which added another clock cycle or three to your access time, or it broke some timed loop you were running, counting on a progression of values through a flag…I’m not a game programmer. Never have been. I’m more the guy that builds the shit that makes it all work underneath the covers. But I have absolutely delivered production code for all sorts of things - security systems, factory automation, medical devices, automotive controllers, you name it - on 8 bit systems of this class. That’s hard. Sometimes, really hard.But games?? Those developers were on a completely different level. Dumping the code, disassembling it, and hand tracing the execution is one “omg, you fucking did WHAT?” moment after another - not to mention that you have to carry around a whole great galloping shit ton of information about how the hardware works, what the physical timing constraints are, what is stuffed in which memory location, etc to be able to make any sense of it.Crazy times.

When the first Star Wars film was made, designers made neat props and cool audio and visual effects. In later films, those had to be reproduced precisely. The advent of digital effects raised the level of what could be accomplished, and that led to hundreds of modelers working on each element of each scene.

Repeat for each part of each instruction.

15,"Between 1986 and 1988, when I was an undergraduate student in electrical engineering, I worked a vacation job atBetween 1986 and 1988, when I was an undergraduate student in electrical engineering, I worked a vacation job atWe didn’t see programming the C64 in assembly as requiring any particular skill. We had so many more resources on that machine, compared with others we had programmed, that it seemed easier, rather than harder. It was possible — indeed quite easy — to understand and master the capabilities of all of the C64 hardware. The data sheets for each chip, even the relatively complex (for their time) graphics and sound chips, were only a few pages long. Sure, you couldn’t just go online and download them as PDFs. You had to actually call a supplier and have them mail the data sheets to you on dead trees. But once you had them, you had everything you needed to fully master the machine. Try that on a modern PC!For development, we did our editing, assembly and linking on IBM PCs, with the resulting code downloaded onto the C64 via RS232C serial link. Debugging could be a bit tricky. Since we could not just put ‘print’ statements in to tell us where in the code our programs were executing, we would typically use graphics cues, such as changing background colours. This could even be done (by writing hardware registers) part-way through display updates, so that we could visually observe how much time our programs were spending in different parts of the code.To us, however, this was not ‘skill’. It was just business-as-usual. And it was a lot less complex than the many tools and frameworks that programmers have available today. 6502 assembly language is not hard to learn or to use. The processor is basically a state machine. It handles instruction and data fetches, arithmetic and logical operations, register updates, data stores, jumps, branches etc in completely predictable and deterministic ways. There are a handful of operations, combined with a handful of addressing modes, and once you have learned those, and which combinations are legal, you are pretty much good-to-go.I was a teenager (18) when I started at Beam. I was basically self-taught up to that point. So was I especially ‘skilled’? Of course not! How could I be? That didn’t stop us from developing some pretty fun games.","246,643 followers",Dushka Zapata,5K,8.5K,231.5M,https://www.quora.com/Do-you-think-the-USA-had-the-technology-to-land-on-the-moon-in-1969

The black things on the right are fans. They are tiny, and they spin really really fast to cool the 2 Xeons CPUs with tiny heatsinks. The only reason those CPUs don’t overheat despite such tiny heatsinks is there is an incredible amount of airflow over them. That’s why the fans sound like jet engines.The SuperMicro motherboard uses a proprietary form factor, and only has a VGA output. PCI-E slots are available if you plug in an expansion card (so the video card would be mounted on an expansion card that’s plugged into the motherboard). That’s how they can fit something like a video card in a case that thin. The video card would be parallel to the motherboard, not perpendicular like they usually are on consumer motherboards.So I had to design and use a laser cutter to build my own case out of acrylic, after finding new (and bigger) heatsinks for the CPUs.This is what I ended up with:Why go through all this trouble? I got a dual Xeon (2x8 cores then, 2x10 cores now) workstation with 64GB of memory for A LOT cheaper than what they normally cost. Was it worth it?

20,"Physics is hard to understand because it violates everyday observation, intuition, and common sense.Take “Newton’s First Law” as an example.

It takes a lot of study to truly understand Newton’s First Law, because it disagrees with what we observe every day. Of course, it doesn’t really disagree, becauseIn fact, physics was discovered by looking at things where friction is small or negligible, such as the orbits of planets, and heavy falling spherical-like objects. Newton realized that the Moon was falling, fallingWhen we do physics demonstrations in class, we buy expensive apparatus for which friction is virtually absent, such as masses suspended on air bearings. We need to do this because the simple equations of physics work only in such circumstances.Physicists are generally uncomfortable with friction. You have a mechanical problem that involves friction? You should probably speak to an engineer, not a physicist. Engineers work with friction all the time. Physicists avoid it. Look at any physics text for the chapters on friction. Typically you’ll see a short mention in the book for freshman, and then very little after that.Physics works best when there is no friction. The two most important examples: space, and the atom. In between, it is hard to do physics because friction can only be modeled approximately.Now with all that introduction, the answer to your question: out in space the vacuum is so high that friction is negligible. That’s why the Earth orbits without losing energy. There is nothing for it to give its energy(There are many good posted answers to this question; I’m giving mine because it is somewhat different from the others, and I think it might address the issue that bothers many people.)","9,918 followers",Brett Bergan,1.3K,7K,82.8M,https://www.quora.com/Do-you-think-the-USA-had-the-technology-to-land-on-the-moon-in-1969
