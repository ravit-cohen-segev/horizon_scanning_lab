They are now on top of a huge pile of weedy, overgrown rubble.At least you have your bearings now, sort of. You remember where the library annex was, but it‚Äôs another pile of rubble. Most other buildings have apparently been swallowed by forest and swamp. You explore until dusk, then return and set up camp. In the morning, you search more widely. Barely anything remains, building wise, and you‚Äôve found nobody else. You have seen a couple packs of wolves. One of them came aggressively towards you, but a couple warning shots scared them off. You see the river near where downtown used to be, but no buildings, bridges, or roads. What happened to all the people?Another day like this, and you decide to head towards Indianapolis, the nearest big city to you. You find what you think might be the route the interstate took, but it‚Äôs just a grassy path. Eventually you get there and do find a few more building remnants, and some in slightly better condition. There are no papers left to tell what happened though. On a wall of what appears to be an old courts building is spray painted ‚ÄúOnly God can save us now‚Äù.In all your searching, you‚Äôve found records, mainly labels on plastic items, dated up to May, 2094, but nothing after that. You are worried. You only took supplies for a week, and have no way to travel backward in time. This isn‚Äôt the future you expected. You hoped for a united Humanity, maybe even evolved into the next stage of being. You expected at least some semblance of normal society. You hoped against any sort of dystopia, but you never thought all of Humanity would be long gone.You resolve to travel to where Washington D.C. was, to try and locate answers on what happened. Two days later you scare off a wolf pack from a deer kill and cut yourself a nice slab of meat to smoke for provisions. At least the water from the streams seems clean enough. You find D.C., and the remains of the capitol building, the Washington Monument, the Lincoln Memorial, and a few other buildings. In the White House, there is a faded dry-erase board with medical jargon and the name of a Doctor at the CDC, so you assume there was some sort of terrible plague or epidemic.You go to sleep that night assuming that you are the only human left alive, but praying that you are wrong. Four weeks later, you believe there is more to the truth than just a plague. The Pentagon showed signs of an active military action being managed. Outside of it, a 100 meter tall obelisk of dark crystal with unintelligible etchings on it, stands in stark contrast to the rest of the complex. It looks almost alien to you. There are two sliders on one side. Activating one changes the etchings somewhat, sliding the other has no apparent impact, though it clicks into place and can‚Äôt be moved after that.Later that night, you are awakened by walking noises and see lights coming towards you. You emerge from your tent hoping to see humans, only to find five alien beings walking calmly towards you. They are bipedal, but with two arms on each side, grey skinned, tall and thin. The tallest is over 3 meters and the shortest is still over 2 meters. The heaviest can‚Äôt weigh more than 100 kilos. They wave you over, making peaceful motions. One speaks, but you can‚Äôt understand it. It‚Äôs speech changes once, twice, and you think to recognize Mandarin. Another few seconds and you definitely recognize French, having taken two years of it back in college. You reply ‚ÄúParlez-vous Anglais?‚Äù That gets their attention, and another change gets them to speak English!They explain that they are the Parroniac race, originally from a planet orbiting a star in the Cygnus arm of the Milky Way. They now reside on hundreds of planets in that sector of the galaxy. You ask what happened to Humanity. They tell you it is a sad story. They were allies and witnesses to the Last Stand of Humanity, in the War against the Cindah-Klorids. The Cindah-Klorids were a warlike race bent on the destruction of any other race of beings they encountered. They came from the far side of the Milky Way, exterminating two other races on their way.The Parroniac had lost several planets to them, as they were not a warlike race, but a race of thinkers, artists, scientists, and logicians. The Parroniac were aware of Earth and Humanity, but had purposely avoided contacting us. Now threatened, they visited Earth and told our leaders of the future trouble headed our way. Some military advisors were flown deep into space to see the Cindah-Klorids in action. A few were caught by surprise, and lost. The ones who returned were convinced our only hope was to prepare for war, and to help the Parroniac learn military strategy to help defend themselves. That was in 2026. The Human-Parroniac alliance spent the next almost 70 years preparing, skirmishing, and outright fighting the Cindah-Klorids, much of it done with Guerrilla warfare tactics, on Earth as well as some of the Parroniac worlds.Those proved very successful against the Cindah-Klorids, who had never seen such resistance or tactics, and didn‚Äôt know how to counter them. Unfortunately, the enemy unleashed a biological weapon on the Humans - the unnamed plague you learned of. The Parroniac were not affected by it, but they could not help the Humans survive it either. The last remaining human leaders offered to give the Parroniac all of the nuclear weapons we had left to use against the enemy. The Parroniac were able to improve them by an order of magnitude, along with their guidance systems. They sent them at every known outpost of Cindah-Klorids, and waited. Their observers reported complete annihilation of the enemy.The Parroniac then offered to take the last Humans back to their planets, in order to put them in a version of cryogenic sleep, until such time as they could create a cure for the plague. There were less than 170,000 humans remaining at that point, all infected. They agreed. It took the Parroniac almost 20 of their generations (a little more than 9500 years) to find and build a cure.Then the Parroniac woke their allies and cured them. They spoke of a great celebration, a feast that lasted an entire year! The humans were returned to Earth, but the devastation and lack of infrastructure made it difficult to live there anymore. After less than a generation, they asked the Parroniac to help them find a new planet to settle. About 400 years ago, Humanity moved for the first time - to a planet they called Oceania. It is described as being very similar to Hawaii and the South Pacific Islands, only with far more islands. The survivors have been fruitful and multipled: Humanity is now up to about two million people now.Then the leader of the Parroniac group pauses a moment, looks at you, and asks the question you didn‚Äôt realize you were waiting for: ‚ÄúWould you like us to take you to them?‚ÄùUPDATE 7/14/16: Thanks for the upvotes and the positive feedback about my little story here.

As the name suggests, this is a sphere built to surround a star (such as our Sun) to collect all of its energy. In many modern (scifi) conceptions, part or all of the sphere is also made habitable with artificial gravity or similar, so you might find colossal numbers of people living there. Other planets in the Solar System‚ÄîVenus, the Moon, Mars, and perhaps a few moons of Jupiter and/or Saturn‚Äîwould also likely be terraformed, that is modified to support human life.Probably humans will have also terraformed and colonized countless habitable planets within several thousand light years of Earth; for efficiency‚Äôs sake, this will likely be done withThanks to the energy provided by the Dyson Sphere, interplanetary travel will probably be trivial (most people may even own a personal interplanetary spacecraft) and travel between the nearest stars may even be common (though it would take years to decades of course). Probably faster-than-light travel will still be impossible, as it requires massive amounts of negative energy, and is thus considered more the purview of a Type III Civilization than a Type II (according to Micho Kaku, humans will reach Type III in 100k to 1M years, so in AD 12016, we will still be 90000 years from reaching that level). But 400 years ago, flying machines were ‚Äúimpossible‚Äù, so who knows.Humans will have hopefully learned to make the most of every planet they‚Äôve colonized, allowing each one to support trillions of people. This means miles-tall, self-sustaining arcologies instead of the urban sprawl we‚Äôve got today, as well as advanced vertical farming (and possibly constructing food with nanofactories, more on that later). The vast majority of all industry and power generation would likely be in space, and and most resources would be gathered via asteroid mining, gas giant mining, and evenI expect that most people will have opted to replace parts of themselves with inorganic equivalents, effectively becoming cyborgs, and genetic engineering of humans will be ubiquitous; these two factors will likely allow humans to live for several centuries, if not a millennium or more. They would certainly give you‚Äîpresumably a fully biological human‚Äîsome curious looks. Another interesting factor is language: it evolves, and over 10000 years, it will do a lot of evolution. Unless the people of AD 12016 can be bothered to reconstruct and use whatever archaic language you speak, you would have to spend a while learning whatever language(s) they now use; these languages would likely be as different from modern English as Proto-Indo-European is.But really, who knows what you see if you went forward to AD 12016.

As a result, you get answers like lunar colonies, space elevators, 1000-year human lifespans, interstellar travel, hyper-loop transport and many more that are slightly less moronic but equally implausible. Technological trends that we observe now will surely continue but the appreciation of their continuation needs a more nuanced approach.If technological progress is not forestalled permanently, something called the ‚ÄúTechnological Singularity‚Äù will almost certainly have happened within the next 10,000 years (quite possibly even within the next 100)Technology is gradually converging toward seamless integration of the physical world with the computing world whereby the physical world is increasingly being converted to data that can then be digitally analyzed and manipulated. This is a million times more efficient than direct manipulation of the physical world and also forms the basis of the whole idea about the ‚ÄúInternet of Things‚Äù.Interestingly, this trend also answers certain critics of modern digital technologies who lament, somewhat nostalgically, that the titanic technological changes that shook the planet in the late 19th and the early 20th centuries such as automobiles, radio communication, air travel, electrification, modern plumbing, vaccination etc. can never be matched by today‚Äôs trending but supposedly frivolous technologies such as the Internet, smart phones, apps, self driving cars, virtual reality etc. This is precisely where such critics are wrong. What we are seeing is not a decline in the rate of innovation but the earliest precursor to an extremely rapid escalation in the rate of innovation that will dwarf anything seen in the previous two centuries.This is where the foundation of what will happen in the next 10,000 years lies. If you were suddenly transported to 10,000 years into the future, you will likely not even see much difference from the present because the physical world that your senses can perceive will not have changed much. You might see the same landscape, the same sky, the same sun, the same stars, and the same planet. No Dyson Spheres, no celestial mega-structures, no cyborgs and definitely no flying cars.By this time frame, since the singularity will probably long have occurred already, what seems likely is the ‚ÄúTranscension Hypothesis‚Äù","33,009 followers",Susanna Viljanen,1.9K,10.7K,164.2M,https://www.quora.com/What-pros-and-cons-does-your-car-have

Extrapolating into the future will be a world of inferior and probably less intelligent species. Transported 10000-yrs into the future you will definitely be considered to be superior (assuming you are average now).The only proviso is genetic engineering. If science can customize the genetics of offspring then the future will be quite different. Correcting defective genes related to our physicality may be possible but it is difficult to imagine altering genes to combat the effects of our behavioral evolutionary downgrade. In short, there will be a lot of relatively crazy, weird and strangely behaving people in 10000-yrs.",253 followers,Hadmat Singh Rajput,2.4K,277,893.6K,https://www.quora.com/What-pros-and-cons-does-your-car-have
17,"The question doesn‚Äôt really make sense. The components on a circuit board don‚Äôt just look cool, they actually do stuff. Capacitors store and discharge energy, copper traces conduct electricity, transformers step AC voltage up or down, etc. The pyramids are rocks. They just sit there. I don't understand how one might mistake it for a computer component.It's like asking, ‚Äúhow likely is it that my toaster plus my bed make a spaceship?‚Äù",UNKNOWN,Ernest W.

Like be used as a worshipping site.Archeological excursions would find objects consistent with worshipping but nothing related to technological usage.Our text books would give many accounts of our daily lives, but these accounts would all be complete balderdash and not mention our technologies at all. Instead they would mention that so-and-so bought camels from such-and-such, as if we would be using camels for transportation.Our preserved physics texts would be almost the same as the physics texts of the people studying us, except in a few places where we were wrong or incomplete. Yet, their physics would not only lack a way of explaining how our super computers worked, but in fact contradicted the physics we have today.Ideas like this make for great imaginative spaces in which you can tell grand stories. But they‚Äôre not useful for describing reality, because they reject so many facts that to accept them you must discard the notion that the world is in any way or shape described by what we see.Which I guess is fine if you‚Äôre on hallucinogenic drugs.
