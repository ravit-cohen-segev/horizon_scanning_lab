No, right?Human Brain is the biggest repository that it can store each and every minute of your life in it. It can accommodate all the books from the biggest library in the world and still wont run out of space.Hope you got your answer! ;)",1 follower,Alexander L,4.6K,13.6K,30.7M,https://www.quora.com/Can-the-brain-remember-an-entire-book
1,"Ofcourse yes!!!….but will need a lot amount of work.The human brain consists of about one billion neurons. Each neuron forms about 1,000 connections to other neurons, amounting to more than a trillion connections. If each neuron could only help store a single memory, running out of space would be a problem. You might have only a few gigabytes of storage space, similar to the space in an iPod or a USB flash drive. Yet neurons combine so that each one helps with many memories at a time, exponentially increasing the brain’s memory storage capacity to something closer to around 2.5 petabytes (or aOfcourse yes!!!….but will need a lot amount of work.The human brain consists of about one billion neurons.

For comparison, if your brain worked like a digital video recorder in a television, 2.5 petabytes would be enough to hold three million hours of TV shows. You would have to leave the TV running continuously for more than 300 years to use up all that storage.That indirectly means that…—-OURHope it helps.","89,623 followers",Aviral Bhatnagar,1.6K,832,34.9M,https://www.quora.com/Can-the-brain-remember-an-entire-book

But memorizing every word in a book is frankly a tremendous waste of time.Why? Because knowing exactly what the third word is on page 65 is really just a parlor trick, good for impressing people at cocktail parties but not very useful to you overall.

That way, my working memory and my attention is spent on what's critical.I end up reading quickly, mostly accurately and retain quite a lot of what I read. I read a lot, though, and it is usually well written and thought out content (books, magazines, articles).","135,254 followers",Hector Quintanilla,39.9K,1.2K,88.3M,https://www.quora.com/Can-the-brain-remember-an-entire-book

Throw away anything that isn’t important to the plot of the book to make the piles smaller. Pick a spot in the room and put a pile there, do that for all aspects of the book.That mess is more like how the brain saves information. It distributes it to relevant areas. Whenever you need something it uses the connections between them to grab stuff off the piles. These get dragged to the door and a book is stitched together as a “memory”. It’s not all in there though, we only kept the important plot points, so parts of the book are made up.Once we’re done “remembering” the book is torn up again, and the same thing happens. Some of the stuff we made up sometimes makes it into a pile, but generally the plots remain intact.In terms of biology things become quite tricky. Brains are huge interconnected networks of neurons, the information is stored in the connections between neurons and how strong the connections are. How its decided what is important and how things are being stitched together aren’t really clear yet. We’re still early in the discovery of brain systems, might be a few more decades before we have a god answer to those questions.As you can imagine, this makes it a bit difficult to say how many books are in there. We have some pretty big piles of shredded books, but we’re not sure how many there are, how much of it is actually made up, and how much fits in there.brains don’t save exact replicas of events of information, it saves important plot points. Memory isn’t a book, a movie, or a file on a computer. It’s a big mushy mess of information being stitched together on the fly.","220,210 followers",Franklin Veaux,1.4K,47.3K,779.7M,https://www.quora.com/Can-the-brain-remember-an-entire-book

But do you know what happens if even one of them fails?You fucking die.-A disease doesn’t make you invincible. You’re still a living organism. The phrase “walking dead” is some mighty fine bullshit. You can’t walk if you’re dead. You’re fucking dead.Once one of those systems up there fails, the party’s over. You die, and turn into a sack of skin laying in the dirt.-There’s no halfway point.

They’re too dumb to understand their health, and totally incapable of helping themselves if they do get injured.And on top of it all, they have a built-in flesh eating disease that will fuck them up faster than you can say “The concept of zombies is super dumb.”Afterall, who the fuck thought it was a good idea to add an incredibly deadly disease to an already completely helpless victim?-In a real life zombie apocalypse, the vast majority of infected people would die in a couple days from the flesh eating disease. Those who survived that, would die of dehydration.Anyone left, would probably trip down a hill, get a small cut, and bleed out because they’re too stupid to perform basic first aid.-Sorry Rick.
