Well my friend, this assumption is incorrect.I know of many students who have obtained a degree in MBA or MS or MTech and still end up having a lower salary (less than 10 LPA).It is not about the number of degrees you have. It is more about the skills-set you have in your arsenal. If you are good in your work, then you would have huge scope to escalate further in tThe dilemma is true.Your credentials suggest that you have been a dedicated student who doesn’t shy away from hardwork. Kudos!Your question has an implicit assumption that by pursuing higher education would lead to higher paychecks. Well my friend, this assumption is incorrect.I know of many students who have obtained a degree in MBA or MS or MTech and still end up having a lower salary (less than 10 LPA).It is not about the number of degrees you have. It is more about the skills-set you have in your arsenal. If you are good in your work, then you would have huge scope to escalate further in the corporate ladder (be it on the technical side or the managerial side).I know of people ( Rahul Gulati ,You need to decide what do you like doing the most (other than sleeping). Don’t look at MS or MBA as a gateway to higher salary. It is a serious decision wherein you commit 1–2 years of your life.Even from a financial point of view, it is like a double-edged sword. During this time, you would have to forego your salary and bonuses, and on the other hand you end up spending a huge amount of money on the tuition fees. So factor all that in while taking a decision on this.If you are happy being on the technical side, then try enhancing your skills-set further. Try becoming a domain expert by going deeper into the technology you are working in. If you are a fresher, then try to enhance your understanding of Data Structures and Algorithms, and then apply to a bigger company where your career can thrive.If you want to take up managerial role, then work for a while and then apply for a managerial position within your organization or take up executive MBA from a good college.Before you think about the above mentioned points, try to think of the bigger picture.Try to find a purpose in your life (I know it is philosophical, but bear with me for a few more minutes). Everyone wants to take home a fat pay check, live a luxurious life, but despite all these materialistic pleasures, sometimes a person is not happy. Probably that is because of the nature of work one is doing.So, the only way out is to find out one’s true passion. I am sure, in your case as well, there has to be a bigger motivation other than money. Find out what that is and start working towards that.Once you start loving what you do, then you will excel in it and once you excel in it, then higher paychecks will follow.Don’t let money to be the primary driving force. It will look enticing in the beginning but if nurtured further, then it can take a huge toll on your health and personal well being.All the best in your future endeavors.I hope this answer provides you with a clearer perspective. Let me know if you need to discuss it further.I’ll end with these 2 quotes:Kaabil bano, kaamyabi jhak maarke peechhe ayegi. #3IdiotsDo what you love and love what you do!Cheers! :)",380 followers,Ankur Saxena,841,56,263.6K,https://www.quora.com/Is-Learnbay-a-good-institute-for-Data-Structure-Courses-in-Bangalore

So let me tell you a few things about China’s treatment of Uyghurs.Firstly, as a minority group, Uyghurs are entitled to special treatment, such as the following:Which people? What treatment towards Uyghurs?Your question is very vague. So let me tell you a few things about China’s treatment of Uyghurs.Firstly, as a minority group, Uyghurs are entitled to special treatment, such as the following:In addition, China acted effectively to remove a threat by ETIM terrorists in Xinjiang, protecting the Uyghurs and other Xinjiang citizens from further bombing and killing by ETIM:Many countries around the world have sent delegates to Xinjiang to see for themselves what is really happening there. Consequently, we get the following statements from them:The Organization of Islamic Cooperation, with 57 Muslim-majority countries as members, made the following statement after sending a delegation to Xinjiang in early 2019:“The Council “welcomes the outcomes of the visit conducted by the General Secretariat’s delegation upon invitation from the People’s Republic of China; commends the efforts of the People’s Republic of China in providing care to its Muslim citizens; and looks forward to further cooperation between the OIC and the People’s Republic of China.”See item 20 in the following minutes:At a United Nations meeting in October 2019, a group of 54 countries made the following speech:Mr. President,I have the honor to make the following joint statement on behalf of 54 countries including Pakistan, the Russian Federation, Egypt, Bolivia, Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Serbia.We reiterate that the work of Human Rights in the United Nations should be conducted in an objective, transparent, non-selective, constructive, non-confrontational and non-politicized manner. We express our firm opposition to relevant countries' practice of politicizing human rights issues, by naming and shaming, and publicly exerting pressures on other countries.We commend China's remarkable achievements in the field of human rights by adhering to the people-centered development philosophy and protecting and promoting human rights through development. We also appreciate China's contributions to the international human rights cause.We take note that terrorism, separatism and religious extremism has caused enormous damage to people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang, which has seriously infringed upon human rights, including right to life, health and development. Faced with the grave challenge of terrorism and extremism, China has undertaken a series of counter-terrorism and deradicalization measures in Xinjiang, including setting up vocational education and training centers. Now safety and security has returned to Xinjiang and the fundamental human rights of people of all ethnic groups there are safeguarded. The past three consecutive years has seen not a single terrorist attack in Xinjiang and people there enjoy a stronger sense of happiness, fulfillment and security. We note with appreciation that human rights are respected and protected in China in the process of counter-terrorism and deradicalization.We appreciate China's commitment to openness and transparency. China has invited a number of diplomats, international organizations officials and journalist to Xinjiang to witness the progress of the human rights cause and the outcomes of counter-terrorism and de-radicalization there. What they saw and heard in Xinjiang completely contradicted what was reported in the media. We call on relevant countries to refrain from employing unfounded charges against China based on unconfirmed information before they visit Xinjiang. We urge the OHCHR, Treaty Bodies and relevant Special Procedures mandate holders to conduct their work in an objective and impartial manner according to their mandate and with true and genuinely credible information, and value the communication with member states.Thank you, Mr. President.

Imagine my surprise when I saw his credentials “Studying Law in Stanford University” – a prestigious course that only the cream of the crop can enter!I contacted him, asking him how he has been all these years, and expressed my curiosity at how he managed to cope with academics in Junior College despite doing poorly in secondary school.

During his free time in secondary school, he'd spend most of his time reading books on law and legislation, philosophy and making notes on what he had learnt. Showing me his notebook compiling all that he had written, I was awed by a sight of him I've never seen before – diligence. However, once he realized the need for perfect grades as a pre-requisite for his dream course, he placed more focus onto his studies, working diligently to rebuild his weak foundations.It made me realize the bitter truth, thatMy friend, conversely, was lazy becausePeople are lazy when they don't prioritize what they are doing. They procrastinate, do other things they are more interested in, and only come back to the task when it becomes urgent, or they finally see a need to get it done.

There is one thing no one can take away from you. Your work ethics and how hard you work. All the best!”The next semester, I got the highest grades, and then I got the highest grades in rest of the semesters. I don’t need to say more, but I believe should you choose, you can take his advice. Then I made it to University of Wisconsin Madison for a PhD in Chemical Engineering, and then to Intel corporation.

Get out of that comfort zone.Try to study even though you're constantly being distracted by things. Make discomfort your new friend. Then you'll be able to study 2 times greater when you are in your comfort zone.","9,685 followers",Avi Estrin,2.9K,185,11.4M,https://www.quora.com/Why-do-people-believe-China-wont-treat-them-like-Uighurs

Why do you do that? In real life, how often do you have to do a bicep curl like movement to lift something?The reason we do these exercises is to build our strength and stamina so that we can respond to any situation where we need physical strength. Even more importantly, it improves our overall health parameters and quality of life.Similarly, the reason we study maths or any other subject is that they help build our mental muscle, develop logical thinking, and help us make sense of the world by recognizing patterns.By studying, we are able to build mental models about the world, so that we can respond to situations more smartly than a monkey or an ape would do (That, in a nutshell, is my answer to this question.I also hope that we encourage our children to ask more of these questions and engage them in a meaningful discussion so that we produce thinking citizens, and not compliant robots.",288 followers,Deepak Mehta,9.2K,3.9K,105.2M,https://www.quora.com/Why-do-people-believe-China-wont-treat-them-like-Uighurs
