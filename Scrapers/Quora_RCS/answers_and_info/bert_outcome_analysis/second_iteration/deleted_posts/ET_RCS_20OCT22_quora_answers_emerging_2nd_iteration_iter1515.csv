But I’ll answer a slightly different question, “Why do we (actually, why should we) require everyone to take Math?”Two big caveatsBut if Math is taught as a sequence of questions and investigations, noticing interesting patterns and curiosities, where every step of inference toward an answer is just as emphatically important as the last step where you arrive at the answer, then a Math education will be as important as I claim it is. You should learn how to make inferences (important in literally every aspect of life) in order to discover a piece of missing information. And you should learn how to communicate all of this.Second,","2,667 followers",Jan M Savage,5.1K,274,3.4M,https://www.quora.com/Why-do-I-have-to-study-advanced-math-in-high-school

I am also going to use the wonderful Julia programming language (you can treat it as a calculator) to demonstrate a new link to the Binomial Triangle, aka Pascal’s Triangle, even though it was discovered several times before Pascal.If you are new to programming and Julia, you are in luck because I am currently releasing a beginner-friendly textbook that teaches both programming and Julia (for link, please see my profile); in any case if you are in a hurry, the explanation below is intuitive, so if you read carefully it should all make sense.Lines of code starting # are called comments, and are explanations of the actual code. Assuming Julia is installed on your computer, you launch Julia in the terminal, and then summon DSP:Now we can use convolution, which I’ll explain soon:(thenend of update.)Now let’s see what that was all about: an ordered list of numbers is called a vector. In the above example, our kernel is a vector, but so is the base. Multiplying two vectors is also called a dot product of two vectors:aMultiply x elements of a and b, then y elements of a and b, then add them all up. In Julia:Feel free to double-check this: 4 * 5 + 9 * 8 = 92.(end of update.)Now, convolution is like aImagine a machine that goes from right to left, multiplies the top and the bottom numbers, adds them up, and repeats this.(Then, we tackle the middle 1. Above it, we have a 1. Their product is 1, so we write this underneath. The left-most one follows the same outcome as the right-most 1.After we write these numbers, we add them all up horizontally: 0 + 1 + 1. I hope this is clear.Returning to our convolution example in Julia, the first convolution is:Note the pattern in the second and third and fourth and the nth:Cool! The machine analogy applies here; see how our Julia convolution produced the Binomial Triangle by going right-left right-left—like a printing machine—(as described in the definition of convolution).(end of update.)Alright, now let's look at the third row: the pattern is 1 3 3 1. Is it relevant to:a?Look at the coefficients of each term:a33bWe established a pattern, so we are halfway through predicting this for anyBut don’t just stop there. The Binomial Triangle can also be found as powers of 11. :)Neat! But why do we need convolution if we can do this so simply? You’ll see later why.We have come a long way from a mere:(Haven’t we?So now pay attention to the powers/exponents:a is to the power of 3 in the first term, while b is to the power of 0:aa is to the power of 2 in the second term:ab’s exponent is rising by 1, as a’s is falling by 1:aand finally:aWe have a new pattern, also called the combinatorics pattern:(Each tall bracket can be written asNewton wrote a neat formula for it (although the theorem was independently discovered by Cardano, and beforeBy this convention, there is only one way to choose 0 items from n items.Newton’s formula is based on the idea of a factorial (another inter-link to our previous topics). A factorial is simply a sum of consecutive products:What about 2 items out of 3? How many different ways of choosing this is possible?Using the factorial method:Three exact ways to choose 2 items out of 3. Let’s see this in practice and what it exactly means:You have a choice of 3 ice-cream flavours.

Very long answer ahead.I'm going to be little blunt in my answer, few people may feel butt hurt. Please don't read any further if you have any affiliations or strong reservations about PCI or any of the thousands of money making machines (read colleges).Long answer short - Pharm D is a innovative scam in the education sector in india. Whether to join or not is up to you.In the early years of y2k, while the engineering colleges were flourishing with the ever increasing demand and soaring prices of the management quota seats bolstered by the painted placement numbers. Many pharmacy colleges were feeling left out with diminishing demand, other allied medical courses eating into it's share of seats. While big colleges were worried about decreasing revenues from pharmacy unit (read college) compared to the benchmark tech, smaller standalone pharmacy colleges had it very bad. With the drying up funds, dying profession and ever decreasing fee (& bribe) from approvals, renewals & inspections the PCI had enough reasons to worry.Around the same time one of our very own revolutionary leaders from PCI came up the idea of Pharm D. The timing couldn'nt have been better.It is important to note here that many educational institute across the country are directly or indirectly owned by politicians. And any new course needs the approval of the government as well as several other govt bodies. In this case it was very convinient to them. So finally in the year 2008, Pharm D was notified in the gazzette.The icing on the cake is that, just like shrewd businessmen, the unholy nexus of PCI, politicians, babus and educationalists (read money minter's) rightly gauged the desperation of unsuccessful mbbs aspirants and the battered ego's of their parents. Coupled it with the misinformation that one can earn 100k + per annum in western countries, especially the US , thanks to the techie relatives there who only enquired or googled for pharmacist salaries and didn't dig deeper to understand the regulatory requirements nor the increased supply of local pharmacist.Note: In the early 2000’s there was acute shortage of pharmacists in the US, which lead to the increased number of pharmacy colleges, this lead to over supply and severe competition for jobs in the later years.No wonder when the program was launched in the year 2008, most number of approvals were in the erstwhile state of Andhra pradesh (thanks to the ever growing telugu's in the US) followed by Karnataka and Tamil nadu.There were many rumors doing rounds those days, like pharm D is equivalent to mbbs, they can prescribe medicines, it will enable easy emigration to western countries and earn $$$$$ (dolaraaan dolaraaan - remember the dialogue in movie angrez)The naive students and their ambitious parents with their bolstered egos started flocking to the new program, presuming & assuming all kinds of things.In the starting years it was a free for all kind of a situation. The colleges were free to set their fee, there was no capped managment quota in many colleges. The institutes made truck loads of money. When I enquired several colleges for admission to the program in the year 2008 many of them quoted a fee of above 14 lakhs, one well known college in the Hyderabad city quoted 20 lakhs. Initially they were hesitant to reveal it to me since I was there alone without a guardian/parent.In the year 2011 I along with several other students from colleges across bangalore have met Mr Suresh Bhojaraj, the president of PCI. He was very upbeat about the course and promised a G.O will be passed by the govt soon to create and mandate clinical pharmacist role across hospitals and other institutes along with slew of measures such as stipend during internship, creation of masters for pharm D graduates on the lines of MD specialization's and several others.So far nothing has happened, if you ask me nothing will ever happen.Whether they ever had any intention or were just befooling the greedy innocent public, we will never know.As a result of relentless protests from pharm d graduates the Telangana govt has decided toIMO it will be discontinued permanently and rightly so if the govt cannot find a solution to this mess created by them. It is criminal waste of time and money. Go for a course which is short in duration, who knows you may change your mind few years down the lane.I still vaguely remember an article by a doctor from kerala who was very critical of the course. Who accused the PCI exceeding it's mandate and venturing into the domain of doctors & MCI. There were few other such anxious doctors, I'm sure they must be heaving a sigh of relief on the colossal failure of this program.2002 Salary Survey: Pharmacist shortage continues to boost wagesStudents breathe sigh of relief over temporary suspension of Pharm D - Times of IndiaWith poor job opps, govt plans to drop Pharma D courseDisclaimer: The opinions expressed here are purely personal and are work of fiction, are not meant to insult, hurt or allege anyone or anything.",0 followers,Laxman Lokhande,631,116,11.5M,https://www.quora.com/Why-do-I-have-to-study-advanced-math-in-high-school
7,"China uses its tourists as an economic bomb. Palau is one of the few nations in the world which has diplomatic relations with Taiwan and hence they don't have diplomatic relations with China.

Despite distance, around 3 three lakhs (3 hundred thousand) Chinese tourists visit Maldives each year which developed special economic ties with China under Abdulla Yameen government (China uses its tourists as an economic bomb. Palau is one of the few nations in the world which has diplomatic relations with Taiwan and hence they don't have diplomatic relations with China. In 2017 China effectively banned Chinese tour groups to tropical archipelago, branding it 'illegal destination'. Western Pacific Ocean island country Palau is closer to China than Indian Ocean tropical archipelago Maldives. Despite distance, around 3 three lakhs (3 hundred thousand) Chinese tourists visit Maldives each year which developed special economic ties with China under Abdulla Yameen government (2013 - 2018). This is how China treats friends and foes - by using tourism bomb.Due to Chinese blacklisting of Palau, hotel and restaurants stand empty, travel agency business at standstill, tourist bus and boats are idling. All people are paying the political price of standing upto Asian bully China. China also played dirty tricks with India in neighbouring country of Fiji. First it fomented tension between ethnic Indians and native Fijians. Ethnic Indians were more than 50% in Fiji in 1987. In 1987, shortly after a coalition government was formed that represented both communities, two military coups were staged by low-ranking Fijian officers that aimed at sidelining the Indian community in politics. A dictator government was formed and Fiji was expelled from Commonwealth. The constitution was re-written preventing ethnic Indian to top political job. Under the dictator Fijian government, China brought its cheap products flooding the market. Many Indian businessmen lost business and they slowly migrated to Australia, New Zealand and USA. This is what some Fijian and Chinese politicians wanted, dilution of Indian influence in Fiji. Former Prime Minister Mahendra Chaudhry once expressed alarm at the high rate of emigration of educated Fiji-Indians. ""If the trend continues, Fiji will be left with a large pool of poorly educated, unskilled work force with disastrous consequences on our social and economic infrastructure and levels of investment,"".Same thing happened in Maldives three decades later. Abdulla Yameen became President by dubious means in 2013 in a controversial election, got promise of Chinese unlimited easy money to buy island and develop infrastructure, bring in tourist traffic, thrown out Indian business and corporates (GMR airport project for example), restricting visa to Indians, signed a free trade agreement and executed in a hush-hush way by Maldives government to dump cheap Chinese products into Maldives and smuggle Chinese products into neighbouring huge Indian market. China rewarded Yameen with huge Chinese tourists.306,000 Chinese tourists visited the Maldives in 2017 from nearly zero before 2013. But Abdulla Yameen lost 2018 Presidential election by a big 12 percent margin and rejected his dictatorial policies and Chinese economic dole out. New President Ibrahim Mohamed Solih is not so kind to Chinese encroachment of Maldives business. Does this mean Chinese tourist boom which happened during Yameen’s period will end up in bust under Solih? Yes. China always uses its international tourists as economic bomb. Just keep track of Chinese tourist data in Maldives in 2019 and 2020.Beijing used economic coercion against Seoul in response to the decision to deploy the US Terminal High Altitude Area Defence (THAAD) antimissile system in South Korea in 2016. Beijing saw THAAD as targeting China, rather than as a way to deter or curb North Korea’s nuclear ambitions. China’s leadership felt the weapons compromised the country’s national security by monitoring its military activities. China then embarked on an aggressive but unofficial campaign to suspend its tour groups from travelling to South Korea. As of December 2018, the Chinese boycott had cost South Korea 7.5 trillion won (US$6.8 billion), according to the South Korean national assembly’s budget office.The Chinese government also targeted the Seoul-based multinational conglomerate Lotte – which had agreed to provide land for THAAD – by fining it for its advertising practices and shutting down a large number of its supermarkets in China for fire regulation violations. China has also intensified its customs inspections of South Korean companies.It banned certain imported products from Dongwon, Samyang and L&P Cosmetics. It also limited the distribution of South Korean content, including movies and shows, according to a report by the US-China Economic and Security Review Commission. South Korean celebrities also disappeared from Chinese television.Insult China or its people, and you will pay for it. That is the message to all nations that stray over China’s red lines, both in official policy and in unofficial treatment of its citizens.Falling out of favour with China was Sweden in September 2018. China’s embassy in Stockholm rejected multiple apologies for a Swedish television programme’s portrayal of Chinese tourists.The programme,In the days that followed, Gui Congyou, the Chinese ambassador to Sweden, claimed the tourists had been maltreated, accused Sweden of violating diplomatic protocol and arrogance, and warned Chinese people against visiting the country. This example shows how China can blow up small tourism related transactions into a diplomatic row.Internationally, 125 million Chinese go abroad ever year. Around 7 lakh Indians travelled to China in 2016 (mostly businessmen who import Chinese consumer goods in bulk), while only 2.5 lakh Chinese made the journey in the opposite direction. In fact, more Chinese travelled to Sri Lanka and Maldives than India.Only of 253,128 tourists from China visited India in 2017. It is only a 0.07 percent increase from 2016, according to official data from the India Ministry of Tourism. Things don't seem likely to change much in 2018. During the first half of 2018, roughly 131,300 Chinese tourists have travelled to India. In comparison, 306,000 Chinese tourists visited the Maldives in 2017 – a tiny country in Indian Ocean region. The lack of interest for Chinese tourists to visit India is simply political.To attract Chinese tourists, India under Modi government has implemented a series of measures in recent years. On July 2015, India established a tourist e-visa for Chinese citizens. In February 2016, the Indian Tourism Board released its independently developed app Incredible India to enhance visitor experience, and in 2018 India introduced an urgent visa that can be applied for and approved within 24 hours.It has also opened a full-fledged regional tourism office in China, planning to see 144 million tourists from China in the next five years (2019 – 2024). India wishes more and more Chinese tourists who currently generate some 21 per cent of tourism receipts in destinations in the world but negligible tourism receipts in India. The 144 million tourist from China will remain pipe dream for India.Modi government however not understood Chinese tourism bomb policy. This policy clearly prevents Chinese population from going to those countries that are politically hostile. India comes under this category. This means Chinese tourists numbers will always grow marginally and never grow exponentially.According to a report in China's Global Times (official communist party newspaper) news website, when one enters ""India"" as a destination on search engine Fliggy, a travel service platform of Alibaba, it shows up several tours to India but not many of them are sold enough. India falls really behind when it is compared to other South-Asian nations like Thailand and Vietnam as a travel destination.""... tours to Southeast Asian countries, including trips to the islands of Thailand or cities in Vietnam, are hot sellers on Fliggy. For example, a six-day trip to the Indonesian island of Bali had sold 165 times in the month of January 2019,"" the Times report said. An official with business that helps with visa applications, said only one per cent of Chinese tourists who plan to travel to Southeast Asian nations is interested to visa India. This is the way Chinese official media, social media discourages people to visit India. India with size of a sub-continent, diverse geography, climate, wildlife, culture, religion including Buddhist circuits, art, architecture and monuments with 32 UNESCO listed world heritage site is a “no go” area for the Chinese simply because of politics. And this situation is not going to improve anytime soon.In 2018, 140 million Chinese tourists spent over $120 billion on overseas trips, revealed China Tourism Academy. Times cited a report by Economic Times that came in August 2018 that India is revamping its tourism strategy in China aiming to see more footfalls from that country. But despite these efforts, Chinese tourists still refuse to see India as a top destination to visit, thanks to the latter's security and sanitation problems, the Times cited many Chinese as saying. Chinese tourists are worried over reports that India have less public toilets and cow dungs are littered all over the places. Besides the sanitation problem, the news about rape cases that have gone viral online has also left an impression among the Chinese that India is not safe.India on 20 December 2018 announced it would further relax visa norms for Chinese nationals by extending e-visa facility to those who visit the country for attending conferences will be issued Conference Visa or as medical attendants. The required documents included a scanned bio-page of passport showing the photograph and details, an invitation from the organisation and political clearance from the Ministry of External Affairs, said the statement from the Indian Embassy in Beijing. The e-Medical Attendant Visa will be issued for those who wish to travel as attendant to e-Medical visa holder. The e-visa facility is now available for Tourist Visa, e-Business Visa, e-Medical Visa, e-Medical Attendant Visa and e-Conference Visa to increase Chinese tourists in India.The announcement came on the eve of Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi's four-day visit to India to attend the “first ever India-China people-to-people exchange forum” which was co-chaired with his Indian counterpart Sushma Swaraj. It seems we are reaching the stage of “External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj and her Chinese counterpart Wang Yi on 21 December 2018 held extensive talks in New Delhi and agreed on ""ten pillars"" of cooperation to enhance cultural and people-to-people exchanges. The 10 pillars are cultural exchange, cooperation in films and television, cooperation in museum administration, cooperation sports, exchanges between youths, cooperation on tourism (but don’t expect dramatic increase Chinese tourists to India), exchanges between states and cities, cooperation in traditional medicine, cooperation in yoga and cooperation in education. The 'High Level Mechanism on Cultural and People-to-People Exchanges' was decided upon during the Wuhan summit between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Xi. China will pursue the ten pillars of cooperation as long as it benefits only China.Under trade pressure (thanks to Donald Trump) and economic downturn in China, Xi turns to India and send his Foreign Minister to 4 day goodwill visit to India in December 2018. ""Today, China-India relations are actively moving forward, with mutual political trust deepening, practical cooperation accelerating, people-to-people and cultural exchanges flourishing, and bilateral coordination in international and regional affairs sustaining,"" Chinese state-run Xinhua news agency quoted Xi Jinping as saying. The Chinese president also expressed the hope for the two sides to make proper use of the high-level people-to-people exchange mechanism. With the help of the profound implication in the two Oriental civilisations, China and India should promote the communication between the minds of the two peoples and forge a closer development partnership, Xi said.""Our expectation for the Chinese outbound market is very small. We saw just 250,000 visitors in 2017. We want this to become 1.4 million by 2019,"" said Satyajeet Rajan, director general of India tourism, at the 2nd Beijing International Travel Mart on September 2018 without giving any elaborate plan to achieve this number. This target is just a pipe dream.Beijing based travel agents think Indian tourism not only failed in terms of China-specific initiatives that Sri Lanka has been doing, but also the lack of hotels in Buddhist sites and lack of Chinese-speakers has been seen as a drawback.China's provinces hold lessons for India's states in how they are making a concerted effort to generate tourism revenues, investing in infrastructure, hotels and marketing. Datong in Shanxi province is known in China as the hub of coal-mining. But with a massive green makeover, it's Buddhism and not coal that it's city officials are now banking on. The famed Yunggang grottoes, one of three renowned sites of Buddhist art in China where towering Buddhas have been carved into sandstone mountainsides, is at the centrepiece of plans to woo foreign tourists - part of a wider push to green the city's economy and move it away from coal-reliance. Taking a cue from China, Indian Railways in 2018 started a luxuary train from New Delhi which will cover most Buddhist tourist sites in north India. Does a Buddhist circuit train can increase Chinese tourist footfalls when politics is not favourable?Return of Hindi-Chini bhai-bhai part II which increased joint military drill may end with another disaster like 1962In recent years, yoga has become a trendy way to relax in China, especially among women aged 25-40. Currently, there are more than 10,000 registered venues that offer yoga courses in China. With millions of practitioners and a growing number of yoga schools nationwide, the ancient traditional exercise has become a cultural bridge for strengthening understanding between the two Asian countries. Although Yoga has helped Indians in getting jobs in China, Yoga cannot bring large amount of tourists to India. Like practicing Yoga, Bollywood movies have become the new trends for the young Chinese. These exchanges undoubtedly narrowed the distance between the people of China and India and reduced trade gap but cannot contribute growth of Chinese tourists in India.There are 14 pairs of sister cities between China and India. Last year, more than a million people, mostly Indian travelled, more than 20,000 Indian students study in China, and there are 42 flights a week between China and India which bring Chinese businessmen to India but not Chinese tourists.Chinese tourists were caught in transacting illegal wildlife trafficking. Two Chinese women were detained in New Delhi in October 2018 after attempting to leave India with US$574,000 worth of shawls made from a species of endangered antelope, prompting Beijing to warn its nationals to abide by local laws when travelling. Embassy officials warned mainland Chinese tourists not to purchase shahtoosh shawls made from the fine hair of the Tibetan antelope, or chiru. The animal is listed as endangered by the World Conservation Union, as well as by China and India. There are many instances of animal parts smuggling like tiger parts, rhino horn, crocodile and other reptiles, pangolin etc. deals were made by Chinese tourists. These deals induce more illegal animal poaching from Indian forests.Chinese tourists in Vietnam airport with illegal 9-dash line printed on their shirtsNot just in India, misbehaviour by Chinese tourists were reported in South East Asian countries like Vietnam, Philippines, Myanmar etc. In fact, rude behaviour of Chinese tourists were reported from almost all countries.Nepal had expelled at least 373 Chinese nationals in 2018 for violating immigration rules and taking part in illegal activities. This was the largest deportation of Chinese nationals from Nepal. Most of those facing deportation worked in Nepal in China funded Belt and Road projects without work visas, or did not extend expired visas. Those deported after facing criminal cases cannot return to Nepal for another 10 years while those who violated immigration rules cannot visit within one year. Crimes of the deportees include gold smuggling, running illegal businesses and money transactions, wildlife smuggling and fraud.",UNKNOWN,James A McCoy Jr.,918,234,318.2K,https://www.quora.com/Why-do-I-have-to-study-advanced-math-in-high-school

The color white represents death, so avoid giving white things as gifts or wrapping gifts in white paper or ribbons.Other things you shouldn't talk about are political and religious issues, such as territorial/economic conflicts, religious policies, or state leaders. Chinese people are often not comfortable discussing topics with foreigners that may cause embarrassm1.talk with ChineseUnless you have a good reason, don't talk about death or mention that someone has died. Death is quite a serious and ominous topic to Chinese people. The color white represents death, so avoid giving white things as gifts or wrapping gifts in white paper or ribbons.Other things you shouldn't talk about are political and religious issues, such as territorial/economic conflicts, religious policies, or state leaders. Chinese people are often not comfortable discussing topics with foreigners that may cause embarrassment to China, as they see the issues from a different perspective. Avoiding sensitive topics like this will keep your conversation positive and friendly.However, not all political topics need to be avoided. Some positive topics, such as the reform and opening up policy, the infrastructure, and the Belt and Road Initiative, are welcomed.2. Don't Disrespect the Customs of Minority Groups and TemplesThere are 55 minority groups in China, and each has their own traditions and customs. Objects related to worship and ancestors are generally not allowed to be touched. It is good to keep your guide’s instructions in mind or ask for permission before you touch something.There are many Buddhist and Taoist temples in China. If you have the chance to visit them, you should be respectful, even if you believe in another religion or are an atheist. It is important to remove your hat, sunglasses, or sometimes your shoes before entering many temples, and it is not a good move to point at the statues with your finger or to step on the doorsill.Generally, you will not be punished or fined if you don’t show any respect, but it is still suggested that you be respectful. If you are traveling with China Highlights, your itinerary can be customized. You can simply remove the attractions you may not like from your tour.3. Don't Make Close Personal Contact, Such as a Hug or KissThe Chinese are less affectionate than people from other cultures, and hug and kiss much less. When you meet a stranger, it might be best simply to greet him/her verbally instead of trying to shake hands as this feels unnatural to most Chinese people. When greeting someone, a slight nod is fine. Don't bow and never kiss or hug when saying hello or goodbye, as personal contact is not that common.In many areas of the country, due to traditions and religion, the head is considered more sacred than other parts of the body. A touch could be considered disrespectful, so be aware of this and don't pat people on their heads or play with their hair unless you are sure of your standing with them.However, you'll find that having personal space in public (especially on public transport) is quite uncommon — Chinese people in crowds may be pushy and crush up against others for a place in line or a seat.Both notions may go against your beliefs and what you are used to at home, where affection is much more readily displayed but personal space is more valued. Learning the nuances of behavior takes time.4. Don't Expect Interpersonal Communications to Be the SameIf your trip to China includes meeting individuals, either for business or personal reasons, you might consider traveling with gifts you can hand out. Appropriate gifts at appropriate times may be useful in building relationships, and they make people happy.However, some items are considered unlucky, or to resemble death or separation; for example, sharp objects, clocks, pears, and shoes. You’d better not give them as gifts. Learn more about the good gifts and bad gifts in China. Likewise, a gift might not be opened in your presence since it may lead to loss of face to open a gift in front of the giver.In China, restaurant bills are never shared. They are not used to “going Dutch”. The person hosting might be embarrassed if you chip in. However, if you have asked people out yourself, it is expected that you pay for the entire bill.5. Don't Forget Your Manners When Using ChopsticksDon't ignore chopstick etiquette if you are about to use a pair. Chinese people have a lot of ideas about this — chopsticks are for eating only. They are not to be used for gesturing to items or individuals. They are also not to be used as drumsticks or as playthings at someone's table.Don't place chopsticks inside the bowl when you’ve finished eating or stick them in your hair. Instead, place the chopsticks on top of the bowl. Definitely don't stand your chopsticks straight up in your food, as it looks like incense for dead people.Read everything you should know about chopsticks.6. Don't Tip in Places That Also Serve Chinese PeopleTipping is a practice that is not observed in China. Taxi drivers, restaurant staff, and bellmen do not expect to be tipped and could be confused and try to give your money back. Not tipping avoids these awkward situations, even though it may take some getting used to if you come from a society where tipping is important.The sole exception to this practice is a tour that is catered to foreign visitors. The individuals on these tours often depend upon tips for their income. Therefore, it is wise to budget for tipping guides and drivers as one would in most other places in the world.7. Don’t Rely on Your Credit CardYou credit card may not so useful in ChinaYou credit card may not so useful in ChinaIn China, your credit card may not be as useful as it is in your country. If you show your card in a shop or restaurant, the staff may get confused because Chinese people rarely use them.People in China like to make mobile payments, such as WeChat payments. If you’d like to give this a try, install WeChat and activate a Swapsy account before leaving home. WeChat is the most popular chatting and payment app in China. It includes a multiple language interface and works well in your country.However, you can bond your credit card to your WeChat account, but the money transferred into it must come from a Chinese bank account. This is where Swapsy comes in. You can use it to trade currency from PayPal/Zelle to WeChat, and vice versa.8. Don’t Forget to Take Your Own Toilet PaperStar-rated hotels in China provide toilet paper but restrooms in other places may not. In attractions, supermarkets, restaurants, or on a train, you may find tissue dispensers but nothing inside them.Although the service level of many restrooms is progressing, time is still needed to solve this problem. Therefore, take your own, or buy some before going anywhere.Another thing you need to be aware of is not to flush toilet paper in public restrooms. If you do so in some long-neglected restrooms, it may lead to serious problems. Just put it in the trash bin.9. Don't Use Unlicensed Transportation ServicesUse licenced transport ensure you have a smooth and safe journeyUse licenced transport ensure you have a smooth and safe journeyWhen you leave a railway station or airport, you may see some people trying to persuade passengers to get into their cars and drive them somewhere. It is not recommended that you try such services as the language can be a problem and they are mostly unlicensed providers. These should only be used by locals.More reliable choices are using public buses or taxis operated by legal companies.Public buses pick-up and drop-off passengers at fixed stops where you can wait for a bus and check the route. There must also be clear signs on the bus indicating its number.A legal taxi must have the company name on the doors and a lamp on top of the car indicating it is a taxi. The driver will use a meter to calculate the fee rather than just telling you how much you should pay.10. Don't Travel on Your Own Unless You Are Skilled in ChineseCrowded railway station in ChinaCrowded railway station in ChinaBesides the transportation problems mentioned above, there are more caused by the language barrier.Most Chinese people cannot speak English very well, and this may be very different from other countries you have visited. If you ask local people for help, you may find that they are willing to help you but cannot understand your words or give you the right advice.The airport, railway station, and your hotel offer English services, but other places may not.If you want to visit some attractions that are a long way from the downtown area but are not on a public bus route, you need to book a shuttle bus ticket at the bus station, get off at the right stop, and find the right way to enter the area, while trying your best to avoid the crowds.

Picking Medicine is an extremely noble choice and one of the most noble professions (not putting any other profession down, just merely speaking about Medicine as a profession individually). Congratulations on getting into a top 20 university in the United States and a HUGE CONGRATULATIONS on staying “starry-eyed” and hopeful. I think we need more of this in this country currently with all of the shootings, budget crises, international wars, and all around other negative things that media feeds to us daily. There is enough negative energy in this world to fill billions of double A batteries (sorry, just had to insert this nerd joke). We seem to talk of being “Starry-eyed” and hopeful of being naive and negative, but if you are using that positive belief to make the world a better place…I say keep doing you :)I usually always start off with a disclaimer ***What I say represents just me and my observations. Not all physicians. I try to do research where I can, but it would be arrogant of me to say I represent the majority. I’ll leave that up to the majority to decide.***Ok. Now to get to the meat of the question. I see that a lot of people are giving advice on how to get into medical school. From the way I am interpreting the question it seems that you are asking what are the Pros and Cons/General good to know things about the path and life of becoming a doctor. So that is precisely what I am going to focus on, it seems some people are already giving good advice about getting into school plus if you want some more advice don’t ever hesitate to comment and I’ll answer whatever questions you may have accordingly, no matter who you are :). Just keep in mind that I am based in the U.S. so most of my advice is applicable here. So now without further ado the pros and cons of being a doctor:Pros:1. Look at that above. That is one huge pro. All joking aside and even if you aren’t Obama, being a doctor makes you feel…for a lack of a better term…bad-ass. Seriously. Who doesn’t feel insanely cool wearing a white coat with a stethoscope around their neck and 20 pens in their front pocket (which you will inevitably lose from loaning them out as a medical student. As a fully trained physician you will find yourself no longer carrying any because every previously mentioned medical student will be excitedly ready to hand you a writing utensil :P). Most of us have been conditioned since we were little to see doctors as cool, amazing, knowledgeable, life saving wizards (I’m looking at you Scrubs, Dr. House, Grey’s Anatomy, ER, etc.). I mean people dress up like us for Halloween!Cons, now that I have finished tooting our wonderful horns as doctors…its time to get to the ugly and boy is there a lot of ugly:1. Stress. It is a quiet 5pm shift in the Emergency Room. You are the only doctor around currently because your colleagues are busy doing other important tasks that need to be done to keep the hospital running. Suddenly you hear that oh so familiar blaring of the Emergency Medical Transport car. In bursts 10 transport beds. There was a mass shooting at the local high school. Someone just unloaded two rifles on a bunch of innocent children who were happy to get out of school. One high schooler closest to you has an open wound gushing out blood on his leg. You quickly run up to him to close up the wound and minimize bleeding as much as possible. You shout to your nurses to get you all the necessary materials, get his blood type, call the blood lab and get some blood over…The bed next over a girl has an open wound on her chest she is now choking on her own blood. The bullet has caused one of her lungs to collapse and her other lung has a puncture wound that is also on the verge of collapsing, but filling up with blood rapidly. She is literally gasping for air with her eyes wide. You realize that she is in more need of your medical attention you run over grabbing as many medical staffs as possible to assist you. You scream to call all of your doctor colleagues over, there is just too much….Next bed over a teacher becomes pulse-less due to blood loss. You now need to grab a defibrillator to try and start her heart back up you are rushing over to grab them when suddenly you hear more blaring sirens in the background. Stressed yet? This has actually happened. Especially with all of the shootings happening in America currently. Somewhere out there are doctors working hard day in and day out dealing with this stress. This is especially true for hospitals that are in lower-income areas of the country where violence can sometimes run rampant. Movies and TV make it seem so glorious sometimes, but remember for a doctor this is reality. This is not a movie. The end is not always beautiful.5. The realization that you are human and make mistakes. This goes hand in hand with everything mentioned before. Even when you are a doctor working for 40 years you will make mistakes. Sometimes you don’t even know you make mistakes. We go into this field thinking that we will ALWAYS be able to find the cure or we will ALWAYS know what is going on with a patient (I’m looking at you again House…). The fact is, sometimes we never know. Sometimes we get lucky and the patient just gets better. Sometimes the patient dies. It is easily typed, but when you experience these things first hand it can be one of the most devastating feelings in your life. It can also be one of the most transformative in a positive way. Either way, just remember we are all human and we need to support one another and reach our potentials.",30 followers,Robin Thomas,8.6K,731,13.7M,https://www.quora.com/Why-do-I-have-to-study-advanced-math-in-high-school

Does any intellectual cares about status?The cons they have mentioned are real, and not exaggerated or fabricated, in contrast the pros they have mentioned do have some exaggeration and fabrication. See what you can gather from that.Now, for my advice, the only good reason to go into medicine is that you like how the job is, you like seeing patients and recognizing what they have and then treating them. That is it.

Decided to focus on surgical studies - the least “bullshit” of all medical specialties.24yo: first year as an intern doctor. Making some money for the first time, albeit mostly by exchanging lots of my (over)time for an hourly based pay - will not do that again in retrospect - youth is worth a lot, and the hourly pay as an intern is terrible, not at all worth it considering money will come later as you get more senior.25yo-26yo: focused on surgical specialty work. Got onto the surgical training program to specialise. Got bored once understood the “true nature” of surgery - longs hours of cutting, burning, stitching. Suffered a quarter life crisis. Quit full time work.27yo-29yo: worked casual as a emergency department senior doctor in a rural hospital for triple the pay I was on when full time. Found a role model in the department director’s style of medical practice - the way he approached each patient, the way he solved each issue, the confidence and style, etc. Decided to model my practice based on a similar attitude. Bought every possible “toy” my heart desired (within reason), but also suffered intermittent bouts of depression due to feelings of being “left behind” when compared to my peers in medicine who were training towards becoming a specialist, and compared to my high school friends who had found very measurable success in the corporate world. Took many many months off work to go travel, F-around, and “find myself”/philosophise. Got first taste of anaesthesia practice during this time when on a few occasions I had to heavily sedate patients in order to “zap” the heart in an emergency.30yo: decided to accept a 70% pay-cut in order to re-enter full time “proper” public hospital work so as to have a shot at applying to the highly competitive anaesthesia training program. Extremely lucky to get on the program within just 6 months of re-entering “the system” - owing to the very good references I got from my 3 years of ED work, and a LOT of luck.31–36yo: felt like anaesthesia is a speciality made for me, and I made for it. Extremely competent and confident at work and studying for the specialty exams felt more natural. Endured two prolonged and highly stressful periods of almost-full time self-directed studying (6 months each) in addition to full time work, in order to prepare for two lots of major specialty exams, which resulted in relationship breakdown each time (among other reasons).37yo til now: practice as a private specialist anaesthetist. Very good at what I do; very happy with my specialty choice, which then finally justifies the original decision to do med when I was 18yo - some 19 years later.The point is, whether you regret something changes as time goes by. If you quit early, and changed to something else and found success there, you will forever be celebrating your quitting as a good decision. If you didn’t quit, and stuck with it, and eventually find success like me, you will be celebrating not quitting as a good decision.Either way, you just need to be competent and persistent and eventually succeed - this would validate all your earlier decisions.Before you can succeed, you naturally consider yourself a “failure” or “work in progress”, so feelings of regret and doubt are natural. It’s more important to focus on achieving success, than lamenting earlier decisions.","90,955 followers",Divyansh Mundra,596,1.2K,61.7M,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-future-scope-of-pharmd
