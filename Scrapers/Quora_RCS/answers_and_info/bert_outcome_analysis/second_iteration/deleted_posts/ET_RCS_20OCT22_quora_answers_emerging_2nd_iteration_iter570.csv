In my 30 year career, I’ve worked in most of the above fields. You’ve got 4 years (more if you add a master’s degree) so you’ve got plenty of opportunities to build a broad foundation then dive deeper into those subject that interest you.I’ve also seen folks who were “one-trick ponies” have career trouble after complacently stagnating in one job/one language for a decade. Things always change in software development and continuous (more or less) learning is required for a successful career. For example, I learned C in college but studied C++ on my own (C++ was not a real thing in the early 1980s). I’ve learned (and largely forgotten) more languages since college than I did in college. I’ve even seen the downfall of once-mighty COBOL and FORTRAN.","1,400 followers",Kaushal Sen Sharma,12.1K,0,0,https://www.quora.com/If-asked-super-nicely-would-an-ISS-crew-be-willing-and-able-to-take-a-picture-from-space-of-someones-house-given-they-would-have-correct-coordinates-Obviously-it-should-not-impede-the-regular-jobs-going-on-up-there

To get around this bottleneck, you have various caches in the CPU, as well as sophisticated execution strategies to push things to be a bit more efficient.But only a bit.No matter how fast we can make the CPUs and RAM, the bus will always be the main bottleneck.Now, enter the brain. Comprising billions of neurons, each neuron can connect from a thousand to a hundred thousand other neurons. And a neuron is fairly sophisticated in its function. For instance, the Pyramidal neurons perform neuronal-like functions in the dendrites, and can depolarise itself to fire faster when a specific pattern is recognized, etc.The “memory” in the brain exists in the connections, the synapses. And no singular synapse is very precise, but the “precision” arises in the aggregate. You may think of a single synapse more akin to a single bit, but not exactly. And unlike how the so-called “neural networks” in most machine learning represents connections, there are no gradations in connection strengths with the synapses. It either connects or it does not.Computer components: the transistor, very fast, very precise, but low connectivity.Brain components: the neuron, very slow, very noisy, but very high connectivity.For the mammalian brain, one may say that a cortical column in the neocortex, and there are approximately 150,000 columns, forming a folded sheet about the size of a good table napkin — and about as thick too. Sometimes you see references to “mini-columns” in the literature. And a single cortical column could easily out-wit a super computer in what it does.Well, I could go on, of course, but I think this give you the gist of the vast differences between a brain and a computer. Outside of the very general notion that they can both do some type of computation, they are nothing alike at all. Other answers tried to use the difference between birds and air planes as an analogy, and I am saying that even that is wholly inadequate in conveying the differences. Maybe the differences between a flying insect to Space X’s Falcon Heavy would be closer to the money.is toas theis to theJust saying. :D","44,239 followers",Kurt Guntheroth,1.4K,13.7K,166.8M,https://www.quora.com/If-asked-super-nicely-would-an-ISS-crew-be-willing-and-able-to-take-a-picture-from-space-of-someones-house-given-they-would-have-correct-coordinates-Obviously-it-should-not-impede-the-regular-jobs-going-on-up-there

There is each and only one human.Computers process information from memory using CPUs, and then write the results of that processing back to memory. Retrieval of a memory by the brain alters the memory itself, usually making it stronger, although at times they can make them less accurate.Computers are deterministic machines in the sense that with a given input, they will always produce the same output.The brain as a whole is considered a non-deterministic system, for the very simple reason that it is never completely the same from one moment to the next. It is constantly forming new synapses and strengthening or weakening existing ones according to how they are being used.","5,329 followers",Dani Richard,620,4.9K,7M,https://www.quora.com/If-asked-super-nicely-would-an-ISS-crew-be-willing-and-able-to-take-a-picture-from-space-of-someones-house-given-they-would-have-correct-coordinates-Obviously-it-should-not-impede-the-regular-jobs-going-on-up-there

That means in the worst case it is the last element of the list you have to check allIf you have a Dictionary<string, Transform> where the key is the name, you don't need to search at all. You can just access it directly with the [ ] notation.This isn't searching, it's just like you knew it was index 348 in a giant list. You only need to access 1 element.(This is O(1) in big O notation, the most efficient possible)Before you ask, yes of course there's a trade off for the efficiency of indexing your data structure this way. Dictionaries uses a little more memory than a List, but it's not a significant enough difference to matter in the vast majority of cases considering what you gain in return. You can still iterate over the Values as an IEnumerable as well if necessary which is very convenient. (You know, like foreach.)So what's a real world example of how I’d use one in practice?Let's say I've written a bunch of different behaviors for enemies, that are all subclasses of a class named EnemyBehaviour… and I want to configure which behaviors the different enemies get from a .csv (comma spaced variable) data file.I can make aand then I can make my behaviors register their constructors in the dictionary like this.Then when the enemy is configuring itself it can get a new instance of the behavior from the string it parsed out of the data file.Of course, if you don't know about Dictionaries then you probably don't know about delegates or lambda expressions either, but I can't cover everything.","44,239 followers",Kurt Guntheroth,574,13.7K,166.8M,https://www.quora.com/If-asked-super-nicely-would-an-ISS-crew-be-willing-and-able-to-take-a-picture-from-space-of-someones-house-given-they-would-have-correct-coordinates-Obviously-it-should-not-impede-the-regular-jobs-going-on-up-there

Within 2 months I gave up.3 years passed from that day, and I took on C  once again 9th -10th grade summer. This time however, I took a different approach at the language. Rather than focusing on reading from books and trying to get the concepts, I just head on tackled the language with projects. I started off building simple things like Tic Tac Toe and few other quirky things. Then I took the same projects and tried to dig even deeper, I started using pointers, and I immesred myself in a whole new world of C. By the end of summer I got a fairly decent grasp of C, I was doing hackerrank challenges fairly well, building more advanced command line tools and I felt that I had achieved my goal.School started, and my interests started shifting, once again. I took a strong interest in iOS development, and I felt my decent understanding in a procedural language would help me in iOS development..And it did. I heard of people taking month long courses in order to develop a basic application, I managed to do the same within 2 weeks. I realized that a lot of what I learned in C, could be applied almost everywhere. Of course, getting used to an Object Oriented Language did take a bit of time, but none the less, I started getting a decent grasp of Objective-C. And then I jumped again.This time I got to node.js, because I wanted to build my own backends for my own applications. Suprisingly, the language felt so familiar to C, and I go the hang of it really quickly. It felt right at home and in a relatively short amount of time, I achieved what I wanted.I can keep going on and on. The point is I jumped everywhere from C to objective-C, to javascript to swift and then back to javascript and C, and python and ton of other stuff. Within a few months you will begin to realize that all languages are just tools. Tools, that will help you build anything you imagine. Some langauges are better than others when it comes to doing certain things, but most of the time, the topics you learn and understand stay with you forever, regardless of what language you are using. The reason why C is both a great and terrible place to start, is because it is a bit more complex than other languages, and has a steeper learning curve. However, if you stick with it, and don't give up like I did initailly (man do I wish I hadn't given up and let 2 yearsish go to waste), the rewards are tremendous. C being a very picky language, you are forced to develop good programming practices, and in the process of figuring out annoying errors, you will also get a strong understanding of many concepts. Combine that with some Object Oriented understanding, and you can do pretty much everything. I am not saying that you can't get the same understanding with other languages, but from my experience, no language is as strict as C, so its likely that you won't deal with many of the problems that you come by in C, and thus won't learn about some valuable concepts. Not knowing them, will definately huant you in the future, when you are doing much longer and complex projects.Sorry for the long rant, but hopefully that kinda helped. Just remember its the concepts, not the language. Just take small projects, or start doing exercises likeIf you found this answer helpeful, I would really appreciate an up vote.
