If a cadet went to see the Academy counseling staff, they would have encountered not a quick answer, but a process. Ain’t nobody got time for that!A lot of the communication in any organisations happens outside of formal channels, a phenomenon called ‘the grapevine.’ At Starfleet Academy, busy cadets always needed a ready sounding board and a source of quick, no-bullshit advice off the cuff and, preferably, off the record. Somewhere between the California poppies and the Shasta daisies, those who sought it, found it.Besides, seeing the counselors could have opened them to future inquiry because the fact of their visits, if not the content, went into their personnel records. Future superiors would typically consult those records in order to evaluate the officer for future assignments and promotions.Remember the ordeal that Captain Jean-Luc Picard put his future first officer, Commander William T. Riker, through upon first meeting him in person? Tough questions, personal challenges, and a surprise order to dock the saucer section of the USS Enterprise, NCC-1701-D….A new captain might choose to put his officers through hell upon meeting them, knowing that if he didn’t, he might learn too late that they would freeze under pressure. Picard might have been looking into a crystal ball when he tested Riker, as if he knew that barely one beard later, the baby-faced first officer would fall into the big chair with a Borg cube in his face and the future of the Federation at stake.Flubbing any of these phases could have put a dent in Riker’s career; or, if he had put a dent in NCC-1701-D’s saucer section, ended it.And yet it could have been worse. Imagine this conversation:PICARD: Commaundah Rikah, I see from your personnel record that you sought help from the Academy counseling stauff 11 times in your freshman year at the Academy. Care to tell me why?RIKER: [brief hesitation] Well, sir, it all started when I decided to go bowling with a monk, a clone, and a Ferengi…PICARD: [snaps] Commaunder, if this is a joke, I am not in the least amused.RIKER:Oh God, why did I go to counselling for my problem with excessive masturbation?Picard knows, of course, that under the rules, he is not allowed to ask this kind of invasive personal question. And he knows that Riker knows. So of course he’s going to ask anyway.Why? He needs to see how Riker will react. Will heAny choice reveals a lot about the character of the Commander.Many a student walked out onto the manicured, peaceful Academy grounds to get a moment alone with his thoughts and wrestle with his problems. As likely as not, he’d notice a stern but decent-looking man nearby.Like the Jardin des Tuilleries in Paris, the grounds of Starfleet Academy in San Francisco were outdoor living spaces designed to get busy people to slow down, think, and feel - all things in short supply in a cadet’s life.Before he’d know it, he’d find himself spilling his guts to this fatherly, receptive man - the guy was, after all, only the gardener, so where’s the harm in telling him what a dick his roommate was, how his astrophysics instructor was out to get him, or how the love of his life in exobotany lab had no interest in him?For Boothby, helping boys and begonias to bloom was his passion, coaxing girls and gardenias to thrive, his vocation. After getting Vulcan cardamom to grow in the climate of San Francisco, getting young people to do the same was simplicity itself.And he kept it simple, did the Academy gardener, because in most cases, they already knew what they had to do, they just needed a little help realising it, and a little encouragement to go do it.Small wonder they loved him for it.",79 followers,Matthew Gagnon,1.6K,72,1.3M,https://www.quora.com/How-is-the-financial-data-analytics-program-from-IIM-Kashipur

Nevertheless, he lived through decades of Federation history. He watched the Klingons go from enemies to allies and the Romulans go from a whisper to a key contender in the Alpha Quadrant. He saw the Dominion overrun the Federation, only for the quadrant to come together.He was so influential because of this wisdom, but also because where would a lovestruck young cadet carve their s.o.’s initials? A tree. Where would a forlorn cadet go to escape the pressures of the academy and their future—aside from Romulan ale—but the lush gardens around the facilities.How many times had he seen troubled if promising young cadets despair? How many times had he watched them surpass their adversity and grow into strong, intelligent Starfleet officer?He never pushed himself on a young cadet, merely waited for them to ask for advice or a boxing coach or an ear to listen to or a need for fresh flowers to brighten their day.

Yet, other than his employment he has nothing personally invested in it (or the students, for that matter). So he’s able to speak freely on matters that could have an affect on the cadets themselves.He’s certainly not apathetic towards them. In fact, it’s because he deeply cares is the reason why cadets seek him for advice. That advice comes with a sense of neutrality that the cadets can respect.

Captain Picard is supposed to be mediating a mining dispute somewhere, so they end up on a shuttle together, where they get a chance to talk.In one exchange, Picard tells Wesley that he is envious of the fact that he is just beginning his adventure. He urges Wesley to seek out a man — the aforementioned Boothby — and get to know him, because he is the ""wisest man at the Academy."" When Wesley asks what he teaches, Picard answers, ""It is a nice little exchange that is far less about Boothby the person, and far more about Picard. Here, we learn that Picard sees wisdom and value in the most unexpected of places, and treasured a relationship with what was likely intended to be a relatively unknown, anonymous worker on the Starfleet Academy grounds. This is a bit of very real humanity and character development.Then, the next season Wesley returns to the Enterprise in the episodeWell done, Wesley.In any event, once on board he sits down and has tea with Picard (Earl Grey, probably pretty hot I would guess). Wesley tells Picard of his experiences at the Academy, including his having met and talked to Boothby, as Picard had suggested.In a somewhat humorous exchange, Picard speculates that Boothby must have told him some stories about his old Academy days, after which Wesley crushes him by telling him that he didn’t remember Picard at all. Until, that is, he showed him an old yearbook and the old codger came around. Ultimately he was proud of Picard for being Captain of the Enterprise.Once again, the point of the Boothby character here was to provide further character development for Picard, and a little bit for Wesley. Picard was apparently caught by Boothby carving the initials “A.F.” into a prized elm tree, and he reveals that he almost failed organic chemistry because of the subject of his amorous tree carving.This shows us that Picard was hardly a rule following square in his youth, as one might assume, but did occasionally get into trouble and act out in ways very common to young people. He was in love with a girl, he nearly failed a class — this all makes him much more human and interesting.Again, this wasn’t about Boothby at all, the character — still not seen on camera — was just a vehicle for character development.Then we get toA truly excellent episode ofPicard arrives, and ends up starting his own investigation into what happened. As it progresses, Picard ends up seeking out Boothby, the now elderly groundskeeper to talk. He asks if Boothby knew the boy who was killed, and he admits that he knew not only him, but all of the pilots.He then tells Picard that after Nova Squadron won theThis proves to be the nugget of information that leads Picard down the pathway that ultimately has him discovering that the accident was due to the cadets practicing an outlawed (and very dangerous) maneuver. Boothby put him on the path to understanding that Wesley and the surviving pilots were lying to the committee evaluating the incident.Again, Boothby is a nice addition here, serving as a trusted old confidant of Picard. He is someone who was there and can provide sage advice and perspective, to help guide his old friend to the truth. He is no one special here — he’s just a groundskeeper, and he is continually made more interesting by the fact that Picard seeks him out and values his counsel, while the rest of the Starfleet brass seem to not even be aware of his existence.This makes Boothby the perfect side character, and makes him feel real. If he was somehow a celebrity on campus and everyone knew him, everyone went to him for advice the same way Picard did, and everyone considered him their own personal Gandalf, than Picard’s interaction with him wouldn’t be all that special or remarkable.Unfortunately, that was what Boothby was about to become.How Star Trek Voyager Ruined BoothbyThe two passing references and the one physical appearance was all that Boothby was inBut everyone loved the storyline, and absolutely everyone lovedEnter: Star Trek VoyagerLook, I like Voyager a lot. I’ve got plenty of complaints, of course, and I do think there are severalBut Voyager wasIt was kind of sad and pathetic to watch, honestly. To me, it was a statement about how little faith they had in the show, the actors, and the stories on Voyager, because they constantly had to “reach back to the past” to more popular Trek franchises, hoping that popularity from them would rub off on them.And it happened a lot.They featured Riker in the episode “Death Wish”:Sulu (and Kang with him) in the episode “Flashback”:Two Ferengi named Arridor and Kol, who were minor characters inAnd of course, they turned Reginald Barclay fromDo you ‘member?All of these tactics are not-so-subtle ways of trying to make Star Trek fans — who had kind of fallen away from the franchise in the spin-offs — remember the good old days. This would get them to watch an episode of Voyager in the hopes that these lost fans would like it, be reminded of the Star Trek they used to love, and then continue to watch Voyager after the guest star left.The problem, of course, is that these tactics don’t really work. It is good for a quick little boost in ratings for an episode or two, but that’s about it. If you are writing a show and you rely on stuff like this, there is no way it ever results in either a creative or a ratings triumph. And again, it betrays a lack of confidence in the show itself, really.But those guest stars I just listed weren’t the only ones. They did this a lot, and they did it with a lot of minor characters. And they did it for the same reason… to tickle your ‘member berries.Which brings us to Boothby.Boothby was featured on two episodes of Voyager — “In the Flesh” and “The Flight” — both of which were intended to satisfy this singular purpose of triggering your familiarity, rather than (as was the case inIn “In the Flesh,” Voyager finds a station containing a disturbingly accurate re-creation of Starfleet Command and Starfleet Academy, constructed by Species 8472.And wouldn’t you know it? This recreation features a replicant of Boothby! And not only a replicant of him, but Boothby is basically the main character of the episode, and the leader of the group that is at the faux Academy.All for the reference. All for the ‘member berries.As stupid as this is, it gets worse. They can’t just have Boothby serve that purpose alone. Oh no. Instead, they need to give our heroes on Voyager their own “Boothby stories” similar to Picard’s.Janeway, for instance was given a gift by the replicant Boothby at the end of the episode — it was a large genetically-engineered rose,Furthermore, a member of Species 8472 impersonating Valerie Archer noted to Chakotay that ""So now Boothby is apparently everyone’s academic advisor?And the stupidity doesn’t stop just in this episode.Next there was (the awful) Voyager episode “The Fight,” where Voyager is caught in ""chaotic space,"" an area where the laws of physics are in a state of flux, and Chakotay begins to hear and see things.Want to guess about one of the things he sees?Yup. Boothby.In this episode, we learn that Chakotay is a boxer, and fought at the Academy. In a flashback, we see him training in a holodeck simulation, and in his corner is Boothby, who apparently used to coach him as a cadet. Throughout the episode, he experiences a series of hallucinations while on a vision quest, which were induced by a group of aliens trying to communicate with him telepathically. One of those hallucinations is Boothby, who continually talks to him.So… he is the captain whisperer, everyone’s advisor, and he is a boxing coach too I guess. Ugh.And this isn’t where it ends, either. He has appeared or was talked about in a ton of other Star Trek media, including a lot of books, and Star Trek Online.But it isn't just where he appeared that is the problem…to they actually considered using him in more incredibly stupid ways. In TNG, for instance, Ronald Moore considered having Boothby appear in the episode “Journey’s End” which would have revealed that Boothby was in fact The Traveler in disguise, which would have been the stupidest plot twist of all time.Open my wrists. I beg you.Okay so you’re asking yourself about now —Why do I care at all about this? He’s just a minor character, people liked him, so the writers expanded his story and made more out of him for the fans.I care about this because what happened to Boothby is a sign of what was the ultimate decline in imagination and storytelling within the Star Trek universe. What they did to him was indicative of why the franchise went into such a steep decline, particularly through Voyager and then later Enterprise.The Next GenerationMore importantly, they seemed to have a sense back then ofBoothby was a phenomenal character in his three references and appearances inTo me, it was kind of like the movie Rudy, when Rudy befriended Fortune, head groundskeeper at Notre Dame stadium. Fortune was not everyone’s life coach — he was a reasonably anonymous, forgotten man who was smart and had things to teach the young man.The beauty of the relationship is that “wisdom can be found in the most unlikely of places” and it says something about both Rudy as well as Fortune that they came together in some way. Rudy was discounted and ignored, but had big dreams, and he was helped along on his journey by the most unlikely of people — a groundskeeper who was unknown and unvalued.It would have cheapened the whole thing significantly if somehow every Notre Dame football player was going down to see the groundskeeper to get life advice from him. I mean, how special would Rudy’s relationship with him be if suddenlySame with Boothby. The fact that Picard — an elite, ambitious, prodigiously talented dreamer — would seek, and ultimately find guidance, support and perspective from a simple groundskeeper was a great bit of character development.It told us that Picard is open — he doesn’t judge a person’s worth by their title, rank, credentials or status. He finds value in places other people would ignore. He is also interested in truly learning about life, rather than simply satisfying academic requirements and jumping through the proper hoops to graduate.He can form deep personal bonds with unexpected people, and understands that life experience is of particular importance in his own journey of self-discovery.In other words, by seeing who and what Picard values, it tells us things about Picard.All of that is destroyed if Boothby is some universally applicable sage cadet confidante, central to the careers of every frigging Starfleet Captain in the Federation. He used to give Janeway roses? He coached Chakotay in boxing? Seriously?If all of that is true, then Picard’s relationship with the man is not particularly interesting or special at all. It tells us nothing about him any longer, and in fact might imply that Picard was just overly-ambitious and knew that a relationship with this person might be a ticket to future career success.The overuse and over-reliance on the character was so off-putting to me that I half expected there to be some kind of stupid time travel episode of Enterprise, where Boothby ended up meeting Captain Archer and giving him important advice on something.So, in the end, they took what was a great, smart, thoughtful, well crafted minor character, and exploited him, turning him into a worthless cartoon character.And that is why I hate what they did to him.","4,204 followers",Joseph Reinemann,580,14.9K,36.9M,https://www.quora.com/In-Star-Trek-why-was-the-gardener-at-Starfleet-Academy-so-important

This is why the government funds the universities. This is why it spends millions of taxpayers money. Research and Development are the primary goals of any university, not educating students as they does in primary school. Education is something that is acquired while doing research and development. This is what, is the base on which the universities are ranked in the world. Now let's go back to ourWho's to blame here? Administration or Students? Both of them.2.1 Let's blame the Administration first.

Now is the time to blame studentsAnd coming to the students, if you were really that interested in your education, no matter what obstacles you face, you would have done some actual development work which doesn't require any guidance from a professor. Most of the IITians does the development work on their own, using the methodology ofBelieve me or not! More than 70% of the students here have absolutely no knowledge of their own stream. They are just undeserving candidates believing themselves to beAll these happens until the final year, where everything turns out to be the opposite for them.

""Hey which book should I refer?""4. ""My family is dependent on me, I have to take care of them. I don't know what to do""5. ""Please teach me these topics for interviews""6.

I still recall that there were students who couldn't attend the workshops or interviews outside the campus because they were either delayed or rejected the out pass when they went for permission a day before. And if you want to buy some small stuff, you have to waste one day to get permission to go out to the nearest town, which happens to be 40 km away.Seriously guys? Why are you imposing illegal restrictions on Majors adults? What gives you the right to stop me from practicing my fundamental rights that this country's constitution has provided me with?

She congratulated me on my new job withSo, there is this old, short, fat ugly guy from the Finance department who has absolutely no business in the academic block, and who goes around watching what students are doing instead of doing his own duty, comes to us while the whole class of 70 students are watching and takes our ID No.s as if we are involved in some indecent activity. The next day he calls me and I still recall his indecent words which brought tears to my eyes and I almost broke down. He said, ""What exactly is his problem?

This was however not the first case of mass food poisoning. A few months earlier, there was a similar case where more than 100 or 200 students got poisoned by the negligence and unhygienic activities of the highly corrupted mess owners, backed by Administration. In one of the disputes between the students and mess owner over the cheaper quality of the rice being provided, and I heard him angrily replying, “4.2 Incident Two : Dual Degree programThere was this concept of Dual degree program for Undergraduate students. It was the only reason I joined this university. As per the guidelines of the university, a student can opt for a dual degree, if he has a CGPA of above 8.0. With regard to this, I went to the academic section in my sophomore year, to register for the program as they didn't mentioned it in the available registration options. I was asked to consult the Academic in charge and ask him regarding the program. I don't recall his name, but I remember that he was a faculty from MME Department. As he didn't knew the procedure then, he asked me one day time and promised me to inform it by then, but every time I went to him, he asked me some more time and finally at last, after many days. he said that the higher authorities are not replying to his query and are not clearly stating the procedure of the program. When I asked him whether I should contact the Director or higher authorities myself, he said it would be of no use as they don't have any real procedure. I went to the then director, but was of no use. Then, with no hope left I contacted the former VC regarding my situation, to which he replied by forwarding my mail to the people responsible and asking them to clearly specify the procedure to me. But those guys never replied even when the Vice Chancellor asked himself because there was no clear procedure. After weeks of wasting time and going around asking people for help, I had no option but to leave the hope and accept the fate.4.3 Incident three : The Science Fair, A Case of CorruptionWhen the first science fair was conducted at the campus few years ago, we were promised that the university will fund the entire budget required for the building of the working models. However we were asked us to spend money from our own pocket and submit the transcripts, to which the university will pay back immediately after the science fair. I still recall that I was confided by @Rakesh_Roshan, who happened to be my guide. He said that the university will pay back the expenses the very next day of the fest no matter what happens. But to this day, the university didn't even pay a single penny. Where did all the budget go? Where is my damn money? You owe me two thousand five hundred rupees. If this is not a clear case of corruption, then I don't know what is? I want the then in charge of science fair Mr. Ravindra4.4 Incident Four : The LibrarianIn the early years, students were not allowed to borrow books from the library. I swear that the then librarian, she used to say,4.5 Incident Five : The Wicked System AdministratorDuring my first year, we used to have this computer based examinations. We were allocated new classes and old laptops. That very week, a day before the weekend examination I was asked by HRT to take the laptop to the server room as the laptop allocated to me was not in a proper working condition. I went to the system admin but he asked me to come the next morning saying that he was busy then. But all I saw was him chatting on Facebook with a crooked smile on his ugly face. Yeah! He was busy chatting with someone. When I stood there for some more time telling him that I have an exam next morning, he wooed me away. The next morning when I went to him, he starting scolding me and asked what I did yesterday. When I said to him that I came yesterday and he was4.5 Restricted Internet Connection : A Synonym forTo be honest, it was mentioned in the admission brochure that the entire campus is provided with high speed Internet connectivity. But the fact is there is no Internet connectivity in the campus. You get only 10MB usage/student of restricted Internet connection between 7 to 10 pm daily [Please note that 10MB is the maximum memory usage limit per day, not the speed, meaning that you cannot download more than 10MB of content per day]. Moreover you can't actually browse anything except for the first page of a few specifically allowed websites. This is by far the most important factor responsible for lagging of the campus development. Although the new Vice Chancellor has issued the permission for installing new Wi-Fi devices at the hostels, but the question still remains whether it will be a fully restricted browsing, allowing only a few websites or a full accessible Internet with a few blocked websites? [UPDATED] : Just found out that after wasting more than 4–5 million of funds for installing networking hardware in the hostels, they still restrict the access to few specific websites. Why the hell the funds were wasted then? The reason that they gave was that the students were watching porn. According to the statistics, DC++ servers and network traffic at the IITs shows that 40% of the usage is only for sharing and accessing porn, where as a merely 6% is used for educational purposes. Below is the reference link.Reference : IIT Kharagpur students search and download - Amazing FactsLet me tell you something, although it is morally wrong in the society, it is a matter of personal privacy and basic human nature. We all watch porn, even if we don’t have an Internet connection too. Every man does that, even if we don’t want to accept the fact publicly here, there is no denying in that. From the administration, down to the students, everybody does it privately. We all know how we were born. We didn’t just appear magically or dropped right off from the sky. Isn’t it a truth that4.6 The Student Magazine : You should never be honestAfter the release of the 8th edition of new Magazine, we were asked to provide with the feedback regarding the edition. After the 7th edition the entire editorial team was changed and the responsibility was handed over to the next batch as the seniors were leaving the campus. Now as it happened the Juniors were not that good at English and the article in the magazine was full of grammatical mistakes as there were no one who took proper efforts to correct them before publishing.Now, I provided an honest feedback saying that last edition of the magazine was not at all good. I believe that it was a mistake to be honest with them. They should have mentioned it properly that ""ONLY POSITIVE FEEDBACKS ARE ALLOWED"". As it turned out later that the new editor said that they are going to publish my feedback on the front page as aAll the articles in the magazine are administration friendly. They only blame students, but never even once blamed the administration! Most of the articles are filtered out. Honestly, it should be renamed to4.7 Shitty Mess FoodDo I have to say anything about this? Whenever we bring some problem to Mr. Vice Chancellor's notice, he say the famous quote"" Did you come here to study or to eat? ""What do you mean?IIT Bombay Menu :4 Times a day, Cost Rs. 1022.

I don't understand how there can be this huge difference just because there is no one to question.4.9 ‘Power Cuts’ EverydayThe administration started a new approach to make students attend the classes, the place where the faculties makes special guest appearances once in a blue moon. They started cutting off the electricity supply to all the hostels fromWhen I said faculties appears once in a blue moon, I didn't mean that the faculties are irregular. In fact, the faculties here are very punctual and disciplined, most of them are friendly and cool, although I must exclude a few. What exactly I meant was that the insufficient number of faculties for relatively large number of students, leaves many subjects untaught during the semester. I still recall there were at least 2 to 3 subjects during my time, every semester which had no faculties assigned to them. Even if someone were assigned theoretically on papers, just for the official sake, so that the administration can show the proof later when asked about the lack of faculties, the faculties couldn't do much. The latter did as much as they can by giving as many lectures as possible, motivating and encouraging students all the time, but as I said earlier, students here the laziest Nazis I have ever seen and no amount of encouragement or motivation would drive them to do something meaningful.Chapter 5The Conclusion - Sh‘IIIT’ HappensIf you are still expecting something good from this university then you are absolutely a fool and you will be eventually doomed.

The university compensates her financially for that service and it is included in the price of your admission.SIDE NOTE:You are expected to to treat her as a human being worthy of respect and common courtesy. Everyone deserves that, even those in a service position.SECONDLY: Your real question is - “I am unsatisfied by the service I am receiving from my Academic Advisor, how do I fix it?”Ok, we have established that it is this woman’s responsibility to assist you, as she is a paid employee of the University. As a student, in need of advising, you are entitled to these services. I suggest your first step is an email that follows the basic format of :• What Is• What should be• Why• OkThis will establish that your communications are being received, your advisor is aware of your concerns, your advisor is aware of your needs and expectations and that your advisor is committed to moving forward with you towards your goals.I always start these kinds of things giving the other person the benefit of the doubt and fluffing their ego a little bit. It costs nothing and you’re about to put them in a box where your kindness is not a weapon to be used against you. I find you catch more flies with honey than vinegar. Also, you can always get meaner, if you start mean and get nice no one trusts it.

Leave one message but continue to call until you speak to her live. Explain that you sent an email, ask her to check her junk mail and offer to forward it to her again. Do not get off the phone until you have a scheduled appointment or you’re satisfied that your needs have been met. The key here is that you’re establishing a clear, dependable line of communication and establishing your needs and expectations.If you were notified that she did read your email, and you haven’t received a response or acknowledgement within 2 business days, call the advisors office. Confirm with the person that answers the phone that your advisor is not on PTO, and ask for the email of her supervisor.Then, call your advisor and leave a message asking her to call you, be sure to mention you do not need her immediate assistance, only to make an appointment to address your concerns at a convenient time for her, in the very near future.If you do not receive a response to your message within 2 business days, forward your email to both her and her supervisor with a note at the top explaining your commitment to your academic career and requesting assistance. For example:Hello Betty Sue Advisor,I saw that you read my email yesterday at 3pm. I can only imagine how overwhelming your responsibilities must be. Give my previous unacknowledged emails, I’m forced to assume that you and I are unable to address these things alone. I am copying Supervisor Wonder Woman in the hope that she can assist us with these concerns directly; or, provide the additional tools we need to successfully resolve these issues.Thank you both for your time, I look forward to hearing from you.Rockstar Grad StudentThis process clearly establishes your expectation that your academic future be a priority for your advisor.

So I learned to either write one-line emails, or to start my e-mails with the sentence (for example) “Three things:”, followed by a numbered list of three one-line items. I have every reason to think that I was reasonably liked by my advisor, and the only issue at play here was that most of the time he was overwhelmed by more emails than he could possibly pay attention to at any given time.

And it’s probably also a good idea to follow the policy of one-line emails (or numbered lists of one-line things, headed by an explicit statement of how many things you’re writing on the email, like I described above), to minimize the chance that she might decide to postpone writing you a reply—which, as I said before, carries the potential that she might later completely forget altogether.",268 followers,Vincentius Rumawas,2.4K,0,0,https://www.quora.com/How-is-the-financial-data-analytics-program-from-IIM-Kashipur
