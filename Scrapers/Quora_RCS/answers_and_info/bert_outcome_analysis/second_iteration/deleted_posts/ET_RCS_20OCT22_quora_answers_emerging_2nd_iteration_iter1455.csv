0,"An ethical 'futurist' in fact has little to do with the actual prediction 'market', but instead is focussed on facilitating awareness in others so that they are able to step back from their own worldview, use far greater depth & breadth in their environmental scanning and analysis, and create perhaps richer outputs in terms of risk management, strategy, operational innovation, and especially also in ethics and long-term 'true' sustainability-based actions.The futurist (or strategic foresight practitioner, which is a far better but less-known term) has no crystal ball.

Merely a deep, accurate and sound knowledge of and insight to business/social behaviour/models, people, PESTLE issues, and is always looking particularly at the 'outliers' of society. They will make some assessments of what is a truly emergent potential, or may adapt in some manner to become a trend. They are all, it seems, passionately-driven and keep high level awareness of local and world events, issues, and have a critiquing nature within an appreciative enquiry framework.There is an understanding of people, technology, culture, business, economics, environment, psychological and social behaviours, design, modelling, history, our physical world (and more). We use normal business/social tools, as well as specifically 'futurist' analysis and models - depending on what may seem best in any given circumstances.The person is often called upon to be a learning facilitator - or a disruptive influencer! We are from all types of backgrounds, but need to add awareness of areas that are not known to them, or that their own worldview prevents them from 'seeing', so they can  help others expand their skills in  this area. A futurist is always a student.Many 'futurists' work in 'trends', which is IMO (and part of our studies supports this view) the area of the 'too late' information. If and event or trend is almost, or in, the mainstream awareness, and is now becoming part of the 'narrative', then the true futurist should probably have known about 'it' some time ago.,Most foresight practitioners undertake a wide range of task/consultancies/self-driven projects, and they absolutely must keep up to date on how to communicate across different media, to different socio-economic groups. On top of all this, most foresight practitioners will make only a very average income, and will 'work' pretty much 24/7.  Some are entrepreneurial (or intrapreneurial) by nature. I feel this is actually something many practitioners do not recognise within themselves, feeling somehow that the entrepreneurial 'tag' may mean they are not quite 'ethical' however in order to initiate change in awareness, one must be able to find ways to engage interest. And most people identify 'futurists' with 'trend analysis', which is merely a part of the (zillion-piece) jigsaw.In summary, the foresight practitioners I know are incredibly smart, usually quite patient, highly self-critical individuals who really do come in multiple personality packages - there is no generic type, merely threads of similar behaviours spread across multiple knowledge areas. Knowing one 'futurist' will never  provide insight to the work. Knowing many futurists possibly will provide you with a view of the tip of the iceberg of practitioner's skillsets. Sometimes the ones you need, are the ones that would most disrupt your current awarenesses. A skilled practitioner can usually do that however without distancing others - after all - it is important to achieve something if you are passionate about positive outcomes and that won't happen if barriers go up.Finally, a futurist must be a patient, natural influencer who is in for the 'long-haul', knowing that there is no way they will ever see the final result of their work, nor have complete control over the output/results of any endeavour. It thus attracts some most interesting people into  the field, many of which are probably  psychological outliers themselves (without that meaning anything that is derogatory). They are IMO all used to being 'loners', in some manner. They are, and must be, mentally tough.There is so much more, and if you are seriously still questioning, I would be happy to post some links to some appropriate readings from very experienced authors in the field.",5 followers,Sanjeeb Kumar,39.8K,0,0,https://www.quora.com/Futures-Studies-What-are-the-main-attributes-of-a-futurist

The other quarter of employees are military officers and soldiers from all service branches (Army Military Intel, Navy Intel, Marines Intel, AF Intel, Coast Guard Intel) that usually work at DIA for a term--i.e., they rotate into DIA for a period of their military service to work as analysts, on specific projects, at certain centers, or in the Defense Attaché Service. For instance, an Army military intelligence officer might get orders to work at DIA for 2-3 yrs before rotating back to a normal Army unit. The director of DIA is always of tradition, a military general or admiral who is appointed for a term.",0 followers,Brent Cooper,4.6K,7.8K,407M,https://www.quora.com/What-qualifications-are-required-to-join-the-DIA-Defense-Intelligence-Agency
