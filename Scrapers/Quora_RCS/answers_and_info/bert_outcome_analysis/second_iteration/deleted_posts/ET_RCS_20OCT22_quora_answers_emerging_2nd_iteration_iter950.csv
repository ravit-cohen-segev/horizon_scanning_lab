I’ll go through each in turn.The SG-1000 failed, selling 160,000 units.The Master System was a distant second to the Nintendo NES, selling only about 10 million units outside Brazil (The Mega Drive/Genesis was a genuine contender and Sega’s high point. 35 million or so sold against the SNES’s 50 million. However Sega made one huge mistake Nintendo didn’t; Nintendo had learned from the Video Game Crash of 1983 and wanted to keep shovelware off their system. The Mega Drive was full of shovelware. (The Sega CD and 32X flopped - but then add-ons normally do).Then came the top to bottom disaster that was the Sega Saturn. It had a surprise launch, but worse was it being hard to program for (Wii U anyone?) and its focus on 2d games. Not one single title from the Mega Drive/Genesis era had a successor on the Saturn - and Sonic didn’t appear this generation at all. By comparison Nintendo demonstrated how to do a 3d Platformer with Mario 64, a 3d Action RPG with Ocarina of Time, and a console FPS with Goldeneye 64, with Mario Kart 64 being the first good Mario Kart (and we have Smash). Yes, that’s as bad as it sounds but worse yet was Sony joining the market with the Playstation and thanks to yet more bad decisions eating Sega’s sports games niche. The Saturn flopped, not breaking 10 million units.Sega’s final attempt was the Dreamcast. It had superb hardware and utterly innovative online. (Were I being bitchy I’d say it had better online than Nintendo has in 2018). Unfortunately for all its strengths as a console it had three basic problems beyond 3d Sonic struggling; Nintendo was still around and with its die hard fans and legacy of great games, the Playstation 2 was a complete juggernaut (selling 150 million consoles), and Microsoft had just thrown their hat into the ring with the XBox. That generation of consoles was cut-throat and Sega again failed to break 10 million.Nintendo meanwhile focused on making sure their brand was consistent, known for quality, and that they had something to say and were trying to drive the medium forward. Sega’s best was superb - but their worst was fairly dire and unlike Nintendo they didn’t build on what they did well in the same way.","8,523 followers",Micheal Contini,2.7K,431,8.3M,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-secret-to-Nintendos-success

There’s never a post-meal bitter taste, figuratively or literally.About a quarter mile from my house is a local convenience store.We commonly refer to it as Hell Mart.The man behind the desk is typically impersonal, listening to sports radio, taking his sweet time to ring you up. Upon checkout, he hands your change back without a smile, word, or any form of amiable human communication.It is unfortunate, because the place was so damn conveniently close.The straw that broke the proverbial camel’s back happened when I went in to buy ice cream from one of these refrigerated bins:(Although the one in question was far more hideous, I can assure you.)Upon grabbing the ice cream bar I realized it had melted, and the entire bin was unplugged.At the counter I said, “Hello - just a heads up. Your ice cream machine was left unplugged. Everything is probably melted or close to it. It probably needs to be replaced.”I’d venture there’s standard protocol response in situation: perhaps “Thank you” and a service call to replace everything, or plugging the machine back in.To his credit, the latter happened: I know because he said “Okay” and walked over and nonchalantly plugged the electrical cord back into the wall.A week later, I returned and tested my hypothesis that none of the ice cream had been replaced. I even reached and got a cone from the very bottom to give the shop a fighting chance.Not so.It was the sheer nastiness of ice cream that has been fully melted and refrozen. That was the last day I walked into that store.This store recently went out of business.Meanwhile, the sandwich shop is thriving and has three more locations.Respect your customers (or watch your business die).","78,435 followers",Shovan Chowdhury,5.1K,505,37.5M,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-secret-to-Nintendos-success

Hand held gaming + home gaming = Nintendo Switch1.)The nintendo switch is the first gaming console from nintendo, which can be used both for home gaming and handheld gaming.2.) Some of it’s rivals, already implemented this some what approach, but they had a limited success.3.) The time is ripe for such a device, and Nintendo is releasing the device just around the time when technology makes it possible to have uncompromising handheld gaming experiences.4.) Considering the growing demand for hand held gaming, this is a major plus point on the Nintendo switch. Many prefer this option while gaming.5.) But, in the recent times, many android phones and android tv’s are available, where the user can play the same game from both the devices, logging on to the same account.6.)Now, this nintendo switch has the same technology, but what makes it special is, it is unique of it’s own kind.(Gaming consoles)7.)Nintendo can just create one game that’s played by everyone.8.)And you don’t have to buy two pieces of Nintendo hardware to enjoy all the company’s games, anymore.b.) Control options1.) There are two options for playing the game. One is with buttons and the other with joy sticks.2.)Nintendo switch controllers are called joy cons.3.) Two Joy-Con controllers can be attached to either side of the switch, or two players can take one each and play two player games.4.) This is a pretty cool option to play huh!!5.) The Joy-Con controllers can be attached to the Joy-Con Grip accessory, which looks similar to a traditional controller when set up.6.) Even without the Joy-Con Grip accessory, which ships with the Switch, users can hold a Joy-Con controller in each hand to play a game.7.) This means we can either play traditionally like a normal nintendo console, or either to this level of coolness, by giving each joy con to each player and play it like a pro.8.) This is a very good feature, and from my knowledge, i think, this is the first gaming console to implement such feature.c.) Games1.) Nintendo is trying to get some new games on its latest console.2.) From the first look that was released recently, the games shown were :-p.)q.) Skyrim from Bethesdar.) Mario Kart 8s.) NBA 2K17t.) Super Mariou.) SplatoonStill it will have many more games, but let’s discuss about these first.The legend of Zelda is not new to Nintendo players. It’s already there in the previous builds.Skyrim is a huge plus point for the Nintendo, because the game has a lot of the fans.And Bethesda has also tweeted this,Among the rest NBA is not yet confirmed either it is from 2K or something else.And the rest of the games, are similar except for a quite changes on Super Mario and Splatoon.3.) However, the official list of games, is not yet released, so we cannot tell how many new games, the users are going to get.d. ) Nintendo Switch is powered by a version of Nvidia’s Tegra mobile processor.Summary :-From the points above, we can assume that the features one and two, are quite astonishing, and it will pull a huge crowd of fans towards it’s side.However, since nobody, knows about how these joy cons, new games, etc. are gonna work unless it releases the product in 2017, we can’t give a guarantee about success of the product.But considering the popularity of the company, Nintendo, we can say that it can attract a good amount of users to it’s side from these cool new features.Also the price of the product is not yet announced. The economic success also depends upon the price on the product.And from the first look of the console, nothing else is shown except these major changes.1.) Handheld + home gaming2.)

But for what it is worth, I'll give you a trait that I think is common among most of these people (including myself).Lots of alone timeEspecially when people are grSpending time alone is really, really importantNote: I don't think I have ever before been compared with Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, etc. I am no where near as successful or accomplished as most of the people on this list. But for what it is worth, I'll give you a trait that I think is common among most of these people (including myself).Lots of alone timeEspecially when people are growing up, spending time alone gives one the space to explore, to be weird, to learn, to imagine, and to dream.Reading is really (REALLY) important.Read fiction and non-fiction. Read wonderful novels written by authors from far-away lands. Read things that challenge your political thought. Read the Bible, the Koran, Buddhist texts, and ancient mythology. And don't just read conventional things assigned to you in school (like Hemingway, Shakespeare, and more) but try to seek out authors on your own.Because most of the people mentioned grew up in a different era, they spent a big portion of their time just reading the encyclopedia. Many of them would eventually read every encyclopedia volume letter. These people had an insatiable need to learn new things.When these people walked to class, they were probably reading a book or a magazine (in those days, it was a paper book). Some of these people even got injured walking into things because they were reading.Most of these people had parents that asked them to READ LESS.Today the encyclopedia is free and on the internet. But today the encyclopedia is so big that it would be impossible to read in a lifetime -- so today choices about what you read could be a bit harder. But reading is still really important.Play actingThey were imagining themselves as secret agents, slaying dragons, marshaling their toy soldiers to do battle, starting businesses, dealing with family situations, and more.ExperimentingThey were building, creating, viewing, and observing. And they were the ones in charge of the experiment -- they were the prodders.Lots of creative activitiesCreating versus ConsumingMost of these successful people spent a large percentage of their time creating vs. consuming. They were building things, starting things, etc. This is really important.Today it is harder to spend time creating because there are so many more options to consume. In the days when most of the above people grew up, one would get bored pretty quickly of the consuming options (usually the best option was to read a book or watch bad television) where today there are just so many more options. In fact, the tablet is essentially designed to maximize consumption (unlike the PC which is a better tool for creation).Get away from the social pressures of schoolBy spending time alone, people get needed breaks from the high school Game of Thrones. Alone-time allows you to spend time actually exploring yourself (rather than spending time conforming to some sort of norm).Today, alone-time is frowned uponWhile there are so many good things about the trend of more involved parenting, one of the very important unintended consequences is that kids have significantly less alone-time than they once did. And even when they are alone, they have the means to be a part of of the larger group through social networks, SMS, and more. So it is harder for them to escape the social pressures of school.So we should expect the best strategy for kids today to not be the same as the best strategy for past generations. But most everyone (young and old) -- especially those that have good social lives and have been reasonably successful -- could use more time alone and more time to themselves.","67,111 followers",Auren Hoffman,15.5K,699,23.4M,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-secret-to-Nintendos-success

I achieved this from a lot of hard grafting and sacrificing some of my social life to some extent.My older siblings (2 brothers, 1 sister) are all Attending Surgeons and all three are married to Attending Surgeons. My parents were just simple working class (aka blue collar) people but my father pushed us all to work hard from an early age.Some people will call it Tiger parenting — having gone through it, I can tell you that the term doesn't really fit the mould my siblings and I are/were in. Yes, we were pushed to work hard and sacrifice some aspects of a social life but we also became successful career wise at a younger age and while many of my peers are struggling to get through things now (finances/relationships etc) I have the luxury to travel whenever I want, buy whatever I want, socialise however I want etc and not have to worry about the financial implications. I'm also at an age where I have an appreciation and zest for life and the relationships I have with people because they were maintained through a period of my life where I wasn't the most sociable person (or my friends who stuck with me through those times, I appreciate and value them so much more and now I get to have fun with them in a way I wouldn't have been able to had I gone the more traditional route with my career).I just want to also point out that I'm not sharing this to ""show off"" or have a ""look at how awesome I am"" moment, but rather because the style of parenting I was raised with is constantly given a bad rep by people who think that kids grow up being social outcasts — I'm far from it and it isn't a one-off. Many of my friends and family members were raised with the same style of parenting and we're all successful, independent people who now get to enjoy the fruits of our labour.Now going back to your question specifically; how did I spend my time between the ages of 10 and 22?Studying. A lot! And all things, not just the requisite homework or assignments I was given. It's very important to have a broad understanding of a topic to give you context. Without context you can't fully grasp concepts, so reading as much as you can on a subject from several different sources with several different perspectives is important.On a practical level, I'll break down the different things I did for each milestone:Age 8-11•• My dad took an interest in my homework by giving me extra sums to do in maths. He even had a few maths text books that he'd take questions out of and give me homework. Again this wasn't something that took a long time. An hour or two at most.• Although we did read a lot of books, he made sure I read passages from the newspaper to him every day. He'd help me pronounce words correctly, he'd have me write down words I didn't know the meaning to so we could look them up in the dictionary. This really helped me not only become a very fast reader, but I learnt ""big words"" and a broader range of words thereby increasing my vocabulary and the spellings and what they meant and how to correctly use them in sentences.• Magazine subscriptions — not to toy or children's magazines but to History magazines and Science magazines as birthday/Christmas presents. (Before anyone freaks out, don't worry, I also got toys).• Music and Dance lessons — several reasons but mainly because it kept me active, taught me the importance of being disciplined and also gave me time and be sociable with other kids my age who also did the same type of stuff.• No TV except on Sundays. More time spent learning about things than rotting my mind with unnecessary nonsense.• Field trips to different museums.• I was fortunate enough to grow up on a farm so was taught a lot just by living in the country. Lots of bug catching and then looking up said bugs etc.Aged 12 - 16All of the above and also:• Practical anatomy and physiology learnt from helping around the farm — helping deliver lambs/calfs. Dissecting frogs. Dissecting Sheep hearts. Volunteering with the local vet and learning more hands on anatomy.• My dad was much more involved with my studies — We'd debate the books I was reading for English and discuss themes. He'd give me short 1 page essays to write. He ordered exam papers for various subjects for the past 4 years and he'd take questions and have me answer them in exam conditions and then have me explain my answers ie show him how I reached the conclusion that the answer for x was y etc. Again, this was at most 3 or 4 hours out of my Saturday — trust me when I say this, I wasn't missing out on anything by doing all of this. On the contrary, it allowed me to skip several years ahead at school.• Learning about engines by learning how to put an engine together — Taught me a lot on preparation, patience etc also gave me a practical life skill. Also; Seing science in motion: theory meeting practice.• Basic DIY — Again a practical skill but also taught me about responsibility and learning how to do something the right way without taking short cuts.Aside from all of the above, I also had practical projects for different subjects from the age of 8 to 16. For example, in Chemistry, at age 11, my father ordered a science kit and equipment and we did a Titrations experiment. For History, I wrote a play about a soldier in WW1 which covered Weimar Germany (again, putting the theory I learnt in a book and expanding thereby gaining more context and a better understand of the subject). My siblings taught me how to suture oranges and bananas. They also sent me video tapes of surgeries and I'd sit and watch them for hours until I had memorised each move. This also came in very handy in Med School because I was already familiar with certain procedures.I should also note, while we did have the internet at home now, it was dial up and I was only really allowed to use it for research and or emailing my friends/siblings.Aged 16-20 (Medical School)•• Revision wasn't so bad either as I had a proven revision method that I'd consistently used for several years.• Still playing piano and taking ballet so I had my social time and time off from studying.Aged 20 - 22•*************A few other things to note:My dad was an immigrant and had a tough childhood and wanted his kids to all be in careers were they would never struggle to find jobs. Medicine is in my opinion, one of the few careers you're guaranteed a job anywhere in the world.Edit:Wanted to clarify my comment about the ability to memorise 95ish % of what I read without having to repeat as a few commenters have picked up on it — I was taught theI am not and never have been considered anything other than of normal intelligence with an above average IQ, hence why I contributed to this discussion as the question the OP asked was about what things successful people do and my methods are things that anyone can do regardless of intelligence or IQ levels.Further reading:Edit 2:Someone in the comments asked why I distinguish between Intelligence and IQ. Here is a simple, easy to understand explanation about the differences between the two.IQ vs. IntelligenceIQ vs. IntelligenceIntelligence is a broad term used to describe the mind of a person. It is a person’s capability to think, to solve problems, to reason out things, to study, to understand and to use language. It is just the depiction of personality, knowledge, creativity, performance, wisdom of an individual. The various theories related to intelligence are classified based on varied intelligences. General intelligence theory was introduced by Charles Darwin.IQ stands for intelligence quotient. Intelligence is just a broad term whereas IQ is used to describe the calculated value of a person’s mind. There are various tests done to know the intelligence of a person and then the IQ score is calculated. This was introduced by William Stern from Germany. The various tests conducted to assess the IQ are Wechsler adult intelligence scale and Gaussian bell curve. The factors which influence the IQ of a person is mortality and morbidity, parental IQ, social status of parents and substantial degree. There are no such factors present for intelligence.IQ is calculated using the score achieved in an intelligence test. It can be calculated as a ratio by a formula. It states IQ = MA/CA x 100, where IQ is an intelligent quotient, CA is the chronological age and MA is the mental age.There is no such formula for intelligence instead there is intelligence test being conducted. There are various problems with the intelligence test and hence should not be conducted when there is a need to decide major decisions like a child’s education and career. The results will vary and are not correct. Hence, dependence on intelligence test should not be done to assess the intelligence.The IQ test is done to determine the type of intelligence of an individual. Hence, both are interconnected. These IQ tests determine mostly the mathematical knowledge and literacy of a person where as other skills like dance, art, music, cooking, foreign languages, defeating an enemy in war, caring for a baby are all not enhanced in this IQ tests whereas intelligence determines all skills of an individual and classifies them accordingly.IQ tests concentrate mostly on civilization and their importance whereas intelligence concentrates on everything like religion, law, philosophy, science, economy and technology.SUMMARY:Source:Source:Edit 3:A commenter asked what books I used to learn theMy dad read a lot of books by Harry Lorayne and I believe Lorayne discussesPersonally, I was exposed to Dominic O'Brien at a Mensa meet where I was fortunate enough to meet him.

""Edit//Reading Obsessively:From a very young age, he seemed to have a book in his hands at all times. ""As Elon got older, he would take himself to the bookstore when school ended at 2pm and stay there until about 6pm, when his parents returned home from work. He plowed through fiction books and then comics and then nonfiction titles. ""Sometimes they kicked me out of the store, but usually not,"" Elon said. He listedElon, in fact, churned throughEarly Role Model:On the surface, life at Errol's house seemed grand. he had plenty of books for Elon to read from cover to cover and money to buy a computer and other objects that Elon desired. Errol took his children on numberous trips overseas. ""It was an amazingly fun time,"" said Kimbal. ""I have a lot of fun memories from that."" Errol also impressed the kids with his intellect and dealt out some practical lessons. ""He was a talented engineer,"" Elon said. ""He knew how every physical object worked."" Both Elon and Kimbal were required to go to the sites of Errol's engineering jobs and learn how to lay bricks, install plumbing, fit windows, and put in electrical wiring.(36)Computers, Entrepreneurship, and Boys Being Boys""I had to have that and then hounded my father to get the computer,"" Musk said. Soon he owned a Commodore VIC-20 , a popular home machine that went on sale in 1980... ""It was spuposed to take like six months to get through all the lessons,"" Elon said. ""While bookish and into his new computer, Elon quite often led Kimbal and his cousins (kaye's children) Russ, Lyndon, and Peter Rive on adventures.Elon also spearheaded their work with homemade explosives and rockets.When not handling explosives, the boys put on layers of clothing and goggles and shot each other with pellet guns. Elon and Kimbal raced dirt bikes against each other in sandlots until Kimbal flew off his bike one day and hurtled into a barbed wire fence.Early Teenage YearsThe boy's most audacious exploits may have been their trips between Pretoria and Johannesburg. During the 1980s, South Africa could be a terribly violent place, and the thirty-five-mile train trip linking Pretoria and Johannesburg stood out as one of the world's more dangerous rides. Kimbal counted the train journeys as formative experiences for him and Elon. ""South Africa was no a happy-go-lucky place, and that has an impact on you. We saw some really rough stuff. It was part of an atypical upbringing -- just this insane set of experiences that changes how you view risk.The boys ranged in age from about thirteen to sixteen and chased a mix of parties and geeky exploits in Johannesburg. During one jaunt, they went to a Dungeons & Dragon's tournament. ""That was us being nerd master supremes,"" Musk said. All of the boys were into the role-playing game which requires someone to help set the mood for a contest by imagining and then describing a scene. ""you have entered a room, and there is a chest in the corner. What will you do? ... You open the chest. You've sprung a trap. Dozens of goblins are on the lose.""Thoughts on SchoolAs Musk saw it, ""I just look at it as 'What grades do I need to get where I want to go?' There were compulsory subjects like Afrikaans, and I just didn't see the point of learning that. It seemed ridiculous. I'd get a passing grade and that was fine. Things like physics and computers -- I got the highest grade you can get in those.I can remember failing subjects in like fourth and fifth grade. Then, my mother's boyfriend told me I'd be held back if I didn't pass. I didn't actually know you had to pass the subjects to move to the next grade. I got the best grades in class after that.(43)Leaving for Canada:Musk spent the next year working a series of odd jobs around Canada. he tended vegetables and shoved out grain bins at a cousin's farm located in the tiny town of Waldeck. Musk celebrated his eighteenth birthday there, sharing a cake with the family he'd just met and few strangers from the neighborhood. After that, he learned to cut logs with a chain saw in Vancouver, British Columbia...Elon ended up enrolling at Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario, in 1989. Outside of his studies,Nicholson remembered the boys' call well. ""I was not in the habit of getting out-of-the-blue requests,"" he said. ""Nicholson's first exposure to the Musk brothers left him with an impression many would share. Both presented themselves well and were polite. Elon, though, clearly came off as the geekier, more awkward counterpoint to the charismatic, personable Kimbal. ""I became more impressed and fascinated as I talked to them,"" Nicholson said. ""They were so determined.""College LifeFor some time, Musk sold computer parts and full PCs in the dorm to make some extra cash. ""I could build something to suit their needs like a tricked-out gaming machine or a simple word processor that cost less than what they could get in a store,"" Musk said."" Or if their computer didn't book property or had a virus, I'd fix it. I could pretty much solve any problem.""...Musk was more ambitious in college than he'd been in high school.Inklings of Future VenturesIn December 1994, he had to come up with a business plan for one of his classes and ended up writing a paper titled ""The Importance of Being Solar.""...The paper went on to predict a rise in solar power technology based on materials improvements and the construction of large-scale solar plants. Musk delved deeply into how solar cells work and the various compounds that can make them more efficient. He concluded the paper with a drawing of the ""power station of the future."" It depicted a pair of giant solar arrays in space -- each for kilometers in width -- sending their juice down to Earth via microwave beans to a receiving antenna with a seven-kilometer diameter. Musk received a 98 on what his professor deemed a ""very interesting and well written paper.""A second paper talked about taking research documents and books and electronically scanning them, performing optical character recognition, and putting all of the information in a single database -- much like a a mix between today's Google Books and Google Scholar. And a third paper dwelled on another of Musk's favorite topics -- ultra capacitors. In the forty-four-page document, Musk is plainly jubilant over the idea of a new form of energy storage that would suit his future pursuits with cars, planes, and rockets. Pointing to the latest research coming out of a lab in Silicon Valley, he wrote: ""The end result represents the first new means of storing significant amounts of electrical energy since the development of the battery and fuel cell. Furthermore, because the Ultracapacitor retains the basic properties of a capacitor, it can deliver its energy over one hundred times faster than a battery of equivalent weight, and be recharged just as quickly."" Musk received a 97 for this effort and praise for ""a very thorough analysis"" with ""excellent financials!""...As Musk began to think more seriously about what he would do after college, he briefly considered getting into the video-game business. He'd been obsessed with video games since his childhood and had held a gaming internship. But he came to see them as not quite grand enough a pursuit. ""My Old Answer:My Old Answer:According to:According to:Musk was born in 1971 in South Africa. Childhood wasn’t a great time for him—he had a tough family life and never fit in well at school.One thing you’ll learn about Musk as you read these posts is that he thinks of humans as computers, which, in their most literal sense, they are. A human’s hardware is his physical body and brain. His software is the way he learns to think, his value system, his habits, his personality. And learning, for Musk, is simply the process of “downloading data and algorithms into your brain.”He became consumed with a second fixation at the age of nine when he got his hands on his first computer, theMusk never felt much of a connection to South Africa—he didn’t fit in with the jockish, white Afrikaner culture, and it was a nightmare country for a potential entrepreneur. He saw Silicon Valley as the Promised Land, and at the age of 17, he left South Africa forever. He started out in Canada, which was an easier place to immigrate to because his mom is a Canadian citizen, and a few years later, used a college transfer to the University of Pennsylvania as a way into the US.In college, he thought about what he wanted to do with his life, using as his starting point the question,Also, apparently there is a biography coming out about him (mentioned in the above article), due on May 19th, 2015.You can pre-order here:","8,614 followers",Abdullah Shiryar,9.2K,182,7.5M,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-secret-to-Nintendos-success

You could have taken a gander at Elon Musk matured 18 and seen a poor youngster clearing goop out of lines, yet his inside grit had previously achieved more than most would live to envision. He was at that point a triumph - it just required a little investment for reality to make up for lost time.So you need to understand what to do between progress in years 10 and 22? Get things done.

They feelSo one of the first thingsI think we all, from time to time, get ourselves involved in activities that do not contribute to our greatest success or happiness. I definitely did at onePeople often say that they are overwhelmed, stressed and feeling like they’re not accomplishing their goals, the things they most want to do in life. They feelSo one of the first thingsI think we all, from time to time, get ourselves involved in activities that do not contribute to our greatest success or happiness. I definitely did at one time, but I made the necessary changes once I became an entrepreneur and learned how valuable each second of the day was—that there really wasn’t any time to waste on activities that didn’t grow me or my business.We’re all looking to be successful in life, but sometimes we are wasting our time doing things that are holding us back from reaching our full potential. And, often, we don’t recognize those things until someone points them out.It’s important to analyze how we spend our days, hour by hour, and regularly look for ways to work smarter, ways to eliminate time-wasters. So by answering this question I want to give eight things that productive, successful people never waste their time doing (and you shouldn’t either):⠀⠀1. Productive, successful people don’t get sucked into social media.Being on social media—checking notifications Facebook, scrolling through pictures on Instagram, reading quick updates on Twitter,So either put a time limit on it—set an alarm for when you need to minimize it, close the app,⠀⠀2. Productive, successful people don’t go through the day without a plan.Successful people have a purpose, a laser-focused plan of things they want to achieve on a particular day. I believe in writing things down—but only the top two or three priorities I need to accomplishWrite down your top priorities and break down those large tasks into more reasonable steps and you’ll see yourself wanting to get them done and crossed off the list.⠀⠀3. Productive, successful people don’t do emotionally draining activities.If you want to step into a truly successful life, you have to focus on things that positively fuel your life. Productive people don’t waste their time on things that emotionally drain them.Before committing to activities on your schedule, be sure the activity will positively add to your life. If you believe it won’t, then think about saying no to it. Also, don’t feel obligated to give an answer right at the time you’re being asked to do something. Think before you say yes and know that it’s OK to say no to requests for your time.⠀⠀4. Productive, successful people don’t worry about things they can’t control.Successful people realize that worrying gets you absolutely nowhere in life, especially if you can’t do anything about a situation.So turn your thoughts to action-based activities. Focus on things you can get done.⠀⠀5. Productive, successful people don’t hang out with negative people.It’s said that you are the average of the five people you spend the most time with. So if you want to be your best, you have to surround yourself with the best people.Be sure to eliminate negative, toxic energy around you. If you want to soar in life, you need to unload what is weighing you down.⠀⠀6. Productive, successful people don’t dwell on past mistakes.Successful people make mistakes. Everyone makes mistakes. The key to being successful in life is not making the same mistake twice, learning and growing from mistakes, and becoming a better person because of them.So when you make a mistake, get into a mindset that the mistake is done with and you can’t go back to the past. Focus on what you learned and design a strategy to positively move forward from it.⠀⠀7. Productive, successful people don’t focus on what other people are doing.It’s great to be inspired by what other successful people are doing, but when you’re constantly comparing yourself to the next person and it’s bringing you down, it’s time to shift your mindset.Be inspired by others, but focus your mindset to only compete with the most important person: yourself.⠀⠀8. Productive, successful people don’t put themselves last in priority.We all go through times that we don’t get enough sleep or exercise because we need to work on a big project. But for long-term success and happiness, you must put yourself first on the priority list.Some great ways to do this is to kick start your day by doing something you love to do—maybe it’s completing a great workout, meditating, journaling or reading your favorite book. Do what works for you. Because when you start off your day doing something you love and that is good for you, you’ll feel happy, focused and strong the rest of the day.Are there things on this list that have been time-wasters for you? Eliminate them so you can step into your best life.⠀⠀P.s.",401 followers,Roshan Thomas,8.5K,0,0,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-secret-to-Nintendos-success

So at the moment, human-like battle droids are not the way to go.This baby up here in the picture moves faster, can move on much rougher terrains, has superior firepower and it’s much harder to hit. It’s also cheaper, easier to conceal, sees in the dark, shoots more accurately and it’s way easier and faster to deploy in sufficent numbers. And it also meets the most important criteria, there is no human life loss if it’s destroyed.True those things are nor intelligent nor autonomous, they are remotely controlled, but there is a reason for that. Our military doctrine still entrusts only humans to take away another human life. Even if human didn’t actually performed the kill, it still made the final decision. That probalby won’t change for a while, but it could if we wanted to. Although it might be a bad idea ( rememberCampaign to Stop Killer Robots - WikipediaSo if we decided to do it, it wouldn’t be to hard to equip our current war machines with software that can analyze the tactical situation and make a decision based on it. All you need is a good processor.Keep in mind the fact that we already have computers able to learn from their own mistakes, like those chess playing computers that get better and harder to beat with each new game they play, they’ve been around for decades.We could also add communication equipement and link all of our assets into a large organized network. They could send and receieve all the important information from each other and from the main computer (like Skynet) which would have all the information from the battlefield, from each and every unit in real time. The computer would have total awarness and total control over the entire army. The best thing is, it would learn, get better and it could upload new protocols to all the robots while the battle is still ongoing. So one of our robots made a mistake and got destroyed? The main computer would analyize how it happened, it would create a new protocol for the same tactical situation and upload it directly to all of the surviving units. It’s the level of knowledge sharing that we are unable to acheive with human warriors.Also, why stop at those tiny robots? We could also add some of those:MQ-9 Reaper droneRafael Protector unmanned surface vehicleActually, we could refit all of our current warmachines ( planes, tanks, warships, subs, even artillery pieces) into AI-driven autonomous drones.Russians already have the capabilitiy to remotely control their new main battle tank T-14 Armata.Americans are already working hard to create networks like the one I described above.Network-centric warfare - WikipediaThe B-52 'Arsenal Plane': America's Super Bomber Is Set for a Massive UpgradeOf course it couldn’t happen overnight, but I don’t think we’d need more than a decade for this to happen.Now to answer you question directly. If we decided to build a million-strong army of human like robots, that would have been a little trickier. We don’t have the infratructure to build, let alone support and service that kind of army.It would have been tremendously expensive and a lot harder than building an army of drones I already mentioned. I don’t think software would pose much of a problem, we are already nearly there and I guarntee it, our army would be smarter and more organized then Trade federation’s droid army.The hardware is a bit of a problem. Sure we did develop some very cool human-like robots, but we never intended them to run around the battlefield and across large obstacles. Even though the Star Wars droids don’t walk really well, at least they can run withouth tripping over and they can acsend the normal flight of stairs.Unfortunately we are way behind here. This is the best walking robot I could find:AtlasAnd this one, but it’s not human-like.LS3, or “Legged Squad Support System”Atlas’s movement is still inferior to the SW battle droids, but as LS3 shows us, we are getting there. A couple of decades and we’ll be able to build human-like robots that move better than those from SW, if we ever decide to do so.Unlike other answers, I think we are at most two or three decades away from being able to build a SW-like droid army. But, we won’t. We’ll continue in direction where we are headed now and continue to develop drones, network them and make the smarter as the time goes by. It’s just more convinient.In terms of ground-based battle I think we’d be able to defeat a droid army of Trade federation in a decade at most. Actually I think we might stand a chance even today.I know, I know. They could bomb us back to stone age from the orbit and apart from nukes we wouldn’t have a defence against it, but other than space travel and capital armed spaceships, SW universe isn’t that much more advanced than us.For the matter of fact there are some areas where they fall behind. Don’t get me wrong here, I am a huge fan of Star Wars franchise and I deeply respect Mr. Geroge Lucas. But as a military enthusiast and SF fan at the same time, it’s hard not to notice some things that advanced space-faring civilizations should do a lot better than us, not worse. Die-hard fans shouldn’t feel like I’m trying to burst any bubbles here. I can think of at least two reasons why is that so.First one is because George Lucas wanted it so. He wanted the space battles to look a lot like WW2, Pacific theater to be exact. So all the technlogy had to resemble what we had back then, otherwise it wouldn’t look so epic. Second reason is the lack of hindsight, for which again Lucas can’t be blamed. Human technology develops exponentially, he couldn’t have predicted how advanced our war machines will get in just couple of decades.The point is, we already have some pieces of military equipment that is way more advanced than anything shown in SW movies. Think about it, have you ever seen in SW an effective AA gun that can easily shoot down a small fighter like an X-Wing or Tie figter? We have this:Phalanx CIWS, or cologually and conviniently called “R2D2 with erection”That thing can shoot down a cruise missile flying at sea level at speeds exceeding Mach 2.5. It would make short work of any SW fighter. Hell I’d install these on the first Death Star and end the rebellion there.There are other examples, like targeting computers, proximity fuses et.c etc. When we consider everything, we’ll probably never have a droid army from Star Wars, but our armies will be smarter, better armed and more deadly by an order of magnitude. And it will happen sooner than you might think. If we somehow had means to send our current military tech to fight against evil forces in SW, in most of the cases my money would be on us, not droids and not stormtroppers.",17 followers,Rom Lokken,917,0,0,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-secret-to-Nintendos-success

Considering the size of these probes and rovers, the ability to create the hardware with human level power is already there.Artificial Intelligence GroupIf you consider that there are a very large number of types of intelligence, possibly even unlimited, then the idea of ""power"" becomes moot.  The human brain, being an organic computer, is actually quite inefficient and slow.  The assumption that only 10 percent of the brain is being used is a fallacy, and when actually looked at, is very limited in its capabilities.But, it does utilize certain strategies that allow it to perform like a super computer.  Pattern recognitions, stereotyping, input filtering and even forgetfulness all play a part.So, it's not hard to mimic the power of the human brain.  The difficulty lies in the ability to mimic the actual processes.  We're getting close to that part, but there's a growing movement which wants to force limits as to how intelligent we can make our computers.

As I type this reply, I’m listening to a beautiful Indian classical music recording by the Hindustani singers, Rajan and Sajan Mishra. Here’s a sample recording of theirs on You Tube, not the one I’m listening to, but it will serve to make the point. As you listen to these magnificent musicians, even if you don’t understand the lyrics or the genre of music, you can still make out the melody, the harmony, the rhythm, the sound of the drone in the background, the emotion of the singers etc. In short, our brains effortlessly unpack all this information as easily as we breathe. Yet, even with a billion GPU machines, you would not be able to extract the same level of information.Part of the magic here is that the human brain is orders of magnitude more sophisticated than the most complex deep learning network ever built, most of which use cartoon like representations like RELU gates as the basic computing unit. Here’s are some sample activation units used as the building blocks in modern deep learning networks.These are all childishly simple compared to the complexity of one single neuron in the human brain, shown below. I spent a whole semester studying the workings of a single neuron. Some researchers in neuroscience spend their entire careers on this topic. A single neuron is fiendishly complex, and its behavior has been modeled by a complex set of partial differential equations that tries to capture neuronal dynamics. Hodgkin and Huxley got the Nobel prize for their model of a single neuron.Now, here’s the kicker. We have roughly 100 billion of these neurons, and each neuron is connected to as many as a thousand other neurons in a highly structured but complex three dimensional network. The new field of connectomics is trying to accurately model the 3D structure of every neuron in the human brain and it’s a hugely challenging task, even if you restrict yourself to a simpler insect like a common housefly (which has a million neurons). Here’s the connectome of a house fly.But this is the just the beginning of the challenge. Unlike the smooth activation functions used in the toy deep learning models, which bear no resemblance to the real ones in our brains, neurons in biology are largely based on spike trains, communicating with their neighbors with what looks like a complex version of Morse code. In short, simple ideas like backpropagation used everywhere in deep learning are profoundly wrong. The brain cannot work using back propagation and this fact has been known for more than three decades.So, the hundred billion neurons in our brains are all chattering to each other in this mysterious language that we are unable to decipher. So, like the drunkard who’s looking for his car keys under a street lamp not because he lost it there, but because there’s light there, AI researchers in deep learning study cartoon models of the human brain that are simply wrong at every level. They do this out of frustration, largely because it’s too hard to model the real brain. We just don’t have good models of spike train dynamics to be useful in deep learning research, yet this is probably the single biggest reason why the brain is so efficient in terms of power consumption. The brain has more computing power than the most sophisticated super computer ever built, yet unlike these behemoths which require gigawatts of power, the brain happily runs on a few watts of power. The spike train design is the biggest reason why our brains are so efficient.Now, the mysteries of the human brain are much much deeper than the sheer number of neurons using complicated inter connectivity and spike train dynamics. The whole human body, including the brain with all its 10^{15} connections, has to be encoded in the human genome, which is about 30 billion base pairs of letters — A,T, C and G for the four amino acids that encode hereditary information. We know the genetic language really well but not well enough to know how it could possibly encode connectivity information that is billions of times larger than the bits in the genome. It’s truly a miracle. It’s like you buy a computer from Apple, but you don’t get the computer, just a tiny strip that you put in a solution when you get home, and watch as it turns into a highly sophisticated supercomputer!The mysteries of the brain only get more puzzling and more insurmountable, the deeper you dig into its workings. It turns out that as the brain develops and grows, neurons are born and move physically to their designated final location. Even more bizarre, many of them don’t survive this trip. How could this design ever work? The computing elements are created, transported and a lot don’t survive the trip.So, in short, the puzzle we are trying to figure out is how to build the most sophisticated supercomputer there is, which runs on ten watts of power, which grows from a single cell, uses complex spike train dynamics to convey information that simply rules out gradient descent type learning models, where individual computing units are a million times slower to respond to changes in input compared to those used in this iPhone on which I’m typing this answer, and yet can effortlessly understand auditory, visual, language and motor control behavior than any computer ever designed by humans.It’s the mystery to end all mysteries. If we understood the human brain, we would posses immense power, both for good, and sadly for evil as well. Perhaps that’s why nature guards her most precious secrets so carefully. Perhaps some mysteries are best left unsolved. We understand what’s happening in galaxies a billion light years from earth, can study the dynamics of black holes colliding and releasing more energy than that produced by all the trillions of stars in the observable universe. But we don’t know the process by which this porridge like substance between my ears, centimeters from my iPhone, decided to turn my thoughts into (hopefully coherent) Quora replies.Perhaps that’s as it should be. We can understand the physical universe around us, but not the mental universe inside our heads. Understanding the physical universe has given mankind colossal power, and as the number of wars, each with more destructive power than the previous ones, have shown, we have still not learned to master our instincts for wanton destruction. Imagine the power we could unleash if we understood the mental universe as well.",158 followers,Paul King,2.8K,2K,17.2M,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-secret-to-Nintendos-success

Extrinsic:Everything that influences your decision and opinion is stored here (ex: why do you like certain music, food or fashion)The interesting part is this motivation usually does not last more than 3–6 months.3. Obsessions:This stores your passions but also your addictions such as being a workaholic, drugs, shopaholic and chasing stuff.When it’s on, you are not free to choose what you want anymore and will go after the obsession.# Imagination:This is the marvel of evolution, it’s what makes us human.Your imagination driver gives you creativity and adaptation.It should take control when dealing with new and complex situations that require you to think out of the box.People usually don’t let imagination driver take control and stick to their motivation driver instead, which leads them to lose out on big innovations.Examples:These mistakes happened because the people in charge relied on their motivation driver which only thinks from what it already knows - if they had used their imagination driver, they can see a future that Steve Jobs saw.When your imagination driver is taking control, you feel calm and in full control.How to activate it on command? think for yourself these questions:Making yourself answer these questions in your head activates the imagination driver.In conclusion we can say that even though our brain is too complex to summarise in a Quora post, this framework gives us a better idea on how we go about our daily lives and how we can use this knowledge to live a better life.Hope this helps you as much as it helped me.I might be updating this post with more findings, follow it if you want to keep updated.All the best!",53 followers,Vivek Ananda,4.6K,143,850K,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-secret-to-Nintendos-success

You already interact with a computer when you use a keyboard, a mouse, or audio input to put information into a computer. You also get information back from the computer when you look at the screen. You can also transfer pictures such as art into a computer. I do acrylic painting and have done this many times. But you probably mean the brain is hardwired to the computer so that there is an exchange of information. The main problem for this exchange is how do you design an interface. The keyboard and mouse act as input interface to a computer and the screen acts as output interface. In computing, an interface is a shared boundary across which two separate components of a computer system exchange information. The computer must communicate with a printer, USB device, compact disc (CD), monitor, mouse, audio, etc. The exchange often involves software, computer hardware, peripheral devices, humans and combinations of these. They must be designed to work together. Human's have interfaces also. The most important is the eye. The eye converts electromagnetic spectrum into electrochemical signals in the brain. Therefore the computer's screen interface communicates with the human's eye interface and everything generally works great! The ear is an interface to changes in a wave of compression and rarefaction of air.There will be many problems in designing an interface between a computer and a human. What do you want to accomplish? If say, you want to load a small part of Google Scholar's database published in English that is around 100 million articles, to the human brain, how would we do this task. Even if we could design an interface to accomplish the task, the data stored in the brain, for a human may be irretrievable or crudely retrievable because of how the brain makes connections in the brain. For example, if I am reading a technical article and I find a word I do not know, I may look it up in the dictionary but that may be insufficient. I may need to read pages of information before I fully understand the word. The brain will make numerous connections in the brain. A simple load mayIf what you want to accomplish is be able to think of a search you would like to make that is not in your memory but is in a computers. Say, I want to look up the definition of a word such as “rarefaction'” above. I just think of the word and it is sent to the computer and the the definition is found by the computer and is then sent back to my brain where I am able to think about the definition. I must design two interfaces and find where to get the information and finally how to store it back in the brain. Too much work when it is easily done now. We do not need this function. What we do need is a computer program that makes connections with information like the Google Scholar's database. Here I do not mean just find some information for me,Many groups are working on ways to fix problems with the interfaces humans currently have available.

To illustrate, if you asked a secretary to type 100 letters from scratch whose typing speed is five minutes per letter, it would take 500 minutes, or just a little over eight hours to type all 100 letters, right? That’s serial processing, one thing at a time; one thing after the other. On the other hand, if you had 50 people, each able to type at the same 5-minutes per letter speed, then it would only take 10 minutes to complete the 100 letters. That’s parallel processing, doing many things at the same time. Very powerful.Although serial processing on home computers went by the wayside in the early 2000s almost all of today’s computers use parallel processing.The fastest computer in the world right now is the Fugaku in Japan.* It has nearly 7.3 million cores [that process in parallel] and a speed of 415.5 petaFLOPS. A FLOP is a single floating-point operation. For example, two numbers added, subtracted, multiplied, or divided is a single FLOP. PETA is a prefix meaning a quadrillion of something. The “S” in petaFLOPS means (per) second. A megaflop is a million FLOPS, just like a megabyte is a million bytes of data. Without getting any more technical than that—and I know there are experts out there who could be much more precise than I am here, so bear with me—these are just rough ideas and calculations to arrive at an overall comparison. So, a rough calculation would be that if it took a person, working at a rate of, say, 5-seconds to do 1 floating-point operation on a hand calculator, it would take a human with a hand-calculator working at 24/7/365, over 600 times the age of the universe to equal what the Fugaku could do in one second. Think about it. It sure sounds like the Fugaku would have a huge advantage over a human brain, wouldn’t you think?Although the internal transmission of signals in the human brain is much slower than that of Fugaku, the brain operation is massively parallel across approximately 100 billion cells (neurons), compared with Fugaku’s 7.3 million cores. Each neuron is interconnected to as many as 10,000 others, amounting to about a 100 trillion interconnected pathways between neurons. Note also that the connections between neurons in the brain—neuron-to-neuron—are not passive. They perform some operations (computations) in addition to the neuron itself. Also note that while comparing a core processor in a supercomputer to a brain cell seems to be stretching things a bit too far, theComparisons between the operation of the human brain and computers are difficult to make and the legitimacy of any comparisons can be argued endlessly. Besides comparing hardware and “software,” results—output, in terms of the computer, behavior in terms of the human—is another way to compare.The awesome power and speed of the Fugaku is not to be denied. Yet, it cannot get up from an easy chair, go to the refrigerator, browse for something to eat, decide to snap open a cold one, throw some cheese and tortilla chips into the microwave, sit back down in the easy chair, watch a comedy show on television, have a good laugh, read a novel and mentally experience being on a pirate ship in the Caribbean ocean in the 1700s, or cry over the injury of a puppy. A human can cry, laugh, love, experience orgasms, feel empathy, taste food, put him or herself in someone else’s shoes, be conscious, experience music, imagine other times and places, experience wonder, awe, fear, disgust, and excitement. The human brain does this with an energy consumption equivalent to a 20-watt light bulb whereas the Fugaku does what it does using millions of watts. Now that’s some astounding computing.The combination of computer hardware and software that would be necessary to accomplish what a human baby does spontaneously in the space of any given five minute segment of any typical day, would make comparing the Fugaku massively parallel supercomputer to the human brain like comparing a paper airplane to a SpaceX Starship.* Since I’ve written this a new “World’s Fastest Computer” has come on the scene; the Frontier (ODCF-5) supercomputer at OAK Ridge National Laboratory (USDE).In 2022, Hewlett-Packard Packard’s",0 followers,Rahul Shrivastava,2.1K,587,53.5M,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-secret-to-Nintendos-success
