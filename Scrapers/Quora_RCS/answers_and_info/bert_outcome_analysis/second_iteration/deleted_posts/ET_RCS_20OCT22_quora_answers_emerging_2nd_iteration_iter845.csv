This is actually an antique telephone from the days of sail.A telephone number dialed to another country will add a “country code,” i.e., one or more additional numbers, to the front of the number. This code is unnecessary for calls made within the national phone system, but becomes necessary when one wants to communicate outside that system.Hence the eighth symbol to dial to the homeworld of the Asgard: it was the stellar equivalent of a country code.

The chevrons engage sequentially as the number is dialed into the dialing device, opening an artificial wormhole between two worlds, which allows interstellar travel without the need for a starship. Travel is, however, limited to whatever can fit through the gate aperture. For this reason, all personnel have to watch their weight.There, he meets representatives of the super-advanced race, who were one of the four original great races. There, O’Neill is restored to his normal self, apart from the anomaly that for once, he is awed and respectful.But apparently it really his him. He’s just really in the moment, and he responds accordingly.Look, you all seem to be quite wonderful…people.And I don't want to sound ungrateful, because I really, really appreciate you getting all that stuff out of my head, but you folks should understand that we're out there, now, and we might not be ready for a lot of this stuff but we're doing the best we can. We are a very curious race.[The Asgard exchange glances, the first Asgard offers O'Neill his hand. O'Neill looks at it and then gently takes it. Then he stands up as the rest of the Asgard look on.]Then the Asgard delivers a bombshell worthy of a cheer, telling Jack:“You have already taken the first steps towards becoming the fifth race.”The Colonel’s meeting with the Asgard presages an impending alliance that will become critical to humanity’s survival.And all that, thanks to an eighth chevron in the dialing code!

4,"This is actually a good question.  The real answer is that Gravity doesn't magically turn off when you get into orbit.  You are still falling back towards the earth.  But once you reach a horizontal speed of about 17,000 miles an hour as you fall towards the Earth you keep missing it.  The only known way to stay in space is to be going really fast and maintain an orbit.   So unless and until we have a rocket that can thrust continuously and hover in one spot, or we invent anti-gravity someday then going fast is the only way to get into space.",62 followers,Jonathan Miller,617,854,3.4M,https://www.quora.com/Given-a-array-of-integers-find-3-indexes-i-j-k-such-that-i-j-k-and-a-i-a-j-a-k-Best-possible-is-a-O-n-algorithm

The only problem with ascending slowly straight up is that once you reached space at your slow speed and then turned your engine off, you’d just fall back to Earth. so you need to go sideways really fast (about 8km/s) so that when you fall back to Earth you miss and just start continually falling and continually missing and thus go round and round and round.Credit for the below to the Obligatory XKCD :Space isn't like this:Space is like",127 followers,Richard Combs,831,7.2K,14.9M,https://www.quora.com/In-Stargate-1994-Daniel-explained-about-7-symbols-How-does-travelling-to-Asgard-s-home-world-use-8-symbols

Whatever the UAPs are, they show up on radar and can fly circles around US jets; attempting to disbelieve in them is fast becoming an exercise of willful ignorance.This doesn’t mean, by the way, that they are necessarily from other planets, although it’s not logical to deny the possibility. It does mean that they exist, many pilots and other military personnel have observed them, and we have no idea what they are.The airfoil/lifting plane technology of human flight is clearly the operative design principle behind the US Navy F/A-18. Video taken by Navy pilots during intercepts near bases or US supercarriers shows unknown aerial vehicles without wings but having far superior performance characteristics.The videos, dating from 2004, 2014, and 2015, are gun camera recordings shot by US Navy fighter pilots attempting to intercept what appear to be aerial vehicles performing far beyond the capabilities of human-built aircraft, and include the cockpit chatter of the astonished pilots. Anecdotally, the Navy videos are most likely only the tip of the iceberg, as personnel and intercepted radio have established that US bases and aircraft carrier strike groups are sometimes shadowed or observed by these UAPs.The Navy does not claim to know their origin (quite the contrary, as the UAP acronym indicates); but the fact that the government admits its services have been scrambling jets to intercept these objects, and no longer denies their existence, is a major validation of public interest and concern regarding these objects.Assuming for the sake of argument that extraterrestrials are in fact visiting Earth in such vehicles, we can say little about the shape from their perspective other than to guess that their designs probably obey the dictum that “form follows function.” That is, whatever advanced propulsion system they use is logically at its most efficient when the vehicle is shaped this way. There may be certain aerodynamic benefits (detailed below) for use in an atmosphere, but the primary consideration would almost certainly have to be the propulsion technology.Humans associate alien spacecraft with the saucer shape because some of the best-known reports of UFOs through the mid to late 20th Century described them with this form. There have been hundreds of UFO reports, including a large and widely observed number of sitings over Washington DC in 1952 and corroborated, again, by radar, although other shapes besides the saucer have been reported. No doubt once the saucer trope became established, then subsequent hoaxes and works of fiction (books, TV, movies, etc.) reinforced it.A saucer-shaped aircraft of the late 1950’s, the Avrocar was a prototype of what would have been a much larger flying saucer, the Avro Arrow. Many of the technologies explored and tested in this once-classified program have been incorporated in cutting-edge aircraft.The same thing has happened with the “little green men” style aliens with the big eyes, who resemble tiki carvings or dolls from Peru. Now, this look is media shorthand for “extraterrestrial.”Assuming, again, that downed saucers were in fact recovered and are being reverse engineered, there is little likelihood that aliens from the crews are assisting the program. The stories claim only that small bodies were recovered from the three crashed saucers, but no living people.The Harrier Jump Jet is capable of taking off and landing vertically thanks to clever use of the jet’s exhaust (visible beneath the aircraft in the photo), a system that underwent early work in Avro’s work on their unsuccessful Cold War-era flying saucer jet.We may be sure that flying saucers are not “aircraft” in the sense that human flying vehicles are. Our technology for flight is based on the use of lifting surfaces or airfoils (eg., wings, helicopter blades) driven through the air in general by internal combustion engines.And while it might be possible to make a jet-powered flying saucer-shaped aircraft today, it proved infeasible when Canadian and American engineers tried it during the Cold War.A Canadian company called Avro worked in the 1950’s and early 1960’s on a saucer-shaped aircraft for the United States Air Force. The hope was that this vehicle would be super-fast and efficient in order to intercept Soviet bombers.A flying saucer designed using human technology of the 1950’s, the Avro Arrow, proved unsuccessful because of aerodynamic instability. With computers, we could resolve the issue today; but not in the 1950’s using only mechanical solutions.The concept of the saucer shape was based on its surprising advantages in flight. For example, engineer John “Jack” Frost at Avro was inspired by…airflow tends to stick to gently curved surfaces, a phenomenon called the Coandă effect. The results showed that engine exhaust could be routed across the fuselage to the area just beneath a saucer, where it would form a cushion of air on which the craft could hover.There are other reasons to give consideration to this geometry.""The flying saucer configuration offers benefits,"" says Russell E. Lee, a curator at the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C. ""It's totally symmetrical, so in theory it should be omnidirectional—if you can figure out how to redirect thrust in an instantaneous and efficient manner.”Additionally, there was interest in the performance and uses of the disc shape from the fledgling American space program, interest which eventually found expression in the shape of space capsules’ re-entry surfaces.….Engineers with the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) were conducting tests of reentry space capsules.Frost and NACA came to this conclusion: Rounded shapes fared best. Robert Braun, a Georgia Tech professor of space technology who served as NASA's chief technologist from 2010 to 2011, says this configuration provides two main benefits to high-speed craft.The test vehicles that were built at Avro’s Ontario facility, however, proved unsuccessful.Getting off the ground is easy. Then it happens, as it always does: When the saucer rises above its 3-foot cushion of exhaust, it starts to buck like a rodeo bull. The researchers are crestfallen; they've seen this instability before. They call it hubcapping, after the circular way a car hubcap oscillates on its rim when dropped on hard ground.The engineers tried everything they could think of to solve this problem, includingshaped nozzles, spoilers, skirts, bigger engine transition doors, vanes—even, at the suggestion of the Air Force, and to Frost's dismay, a tail. Nothing worked.And the Avro aircraft had another problem: despite having massive jet engines, it was underpowered. The engineers attempted to steer it by re-routing the air flow through the vehicle body but this led to energy-reducing turbulence.""They didn't understand the fluid dynamics,"" says Jeff Underwood, historian of the National Museum of the U.S. Air Force at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio. ""The thing probably had plenty of power, it's just that all the thrust was being bled off in friction. As it was trying to push the air around, it was all being wasted.""Although the Avro Arrow program was canceled in 1961 due to the instability and power issues, many principles explored in the program remain valid and are used in today's most advanced aircraft.Sophisticated stealth technology was made possible through the use of onboard computers that make constant minute adjustments; in this way, even a theoretically unstable aircraft design can stay airborne. Examples include the American stealth fighter and stealth bomber and recent high-performance fighter jets such as the F-22 Raptor and F-35 Lightning.The B-2 Spirit, better known as the Stealth Bomber, incorporates a number of technologies that have been refined and made practical since the Avro Arrow program. The inherent instability in this plane, which is all but invisible to radar, is so great that it requires computers to remain airborne.The power issues that plagued the Avro Arrow program were eventually resolved as well. Instead of re-routing the jet flow, engineers found it was far more efficient to swivel the exhaust nozzle. This advance eventually led to one of the most successful military aircraft of the jet age, the Hawker-Siddeley Harrier Jump Jet and its successors, such as the “B” version of the F-35, which also has “Vertical/Short Takeoff and Landing” (VSTOL) capability, and the F-22, which uses ducted exhaust to achieve unprecedented manoeuverability.Before I close, let me note that a human-built flying saucer, whether built in the 1950’s or today, would still be subject to the limitations imposed by our technology - that is, despite their unconventional shape, they would still be conventional aircraft. As it happens, the more conventional “bird shape”, or the related delta shape, remains the best for our technology. This is why we don’t see prototype saucer aircraft - their technology is incorporated into more conventional shapes.When humans do resume building flying saucer-shaped vehicles, it will probably be because we have developed propulsion systems that are based not in mass reaction but in something like field manipulation that today counts as exotic physics.At this point, we can send our saucers to someone else’s planet and set","220,203 followers",Franklin Veaux,928,47.3K,779.8M,https://www.quora.com/Given-a-array-of-integers-find-3-indexes-i-j-k-such-that-i-j-k-and-a-i-a-j-a-k-Best-possible-is-a-O-n-algorithm

So according to accepted science, aerodynamics is the “only” way to fly, while electrostatics, electrodynamics, and electrogravitics are “pseudoscience”.

Once you have planted your foot firmly, you’ll have a much better time tackling the mammoth beast that radiology is.Radiology residency — on the whole — is not as hectic as, say, medicine, surgery, OBG, and pediatrics. However, you do have to attend emergency calls; you can’t dodge the ball on that one. Still, residents have a degree of breathing space not afforded to them in other disciplines. (I should know. I switched to radiology in the midst of my surgery training.)That, of course, does not mean that you can slack off. There is just too much to learn. You have conventional radiography, fluoroscopy, ultrasound, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, mammography, interventional radiology, just to name a few. Each of these takes years to master. Fortunately, as a resident, you are expected to know much less — the bare minimum needed to handle a daily practice. Mastery would come by-and-by.Oh, did I tell you about the reading part? I guess I did. But it bears repeating.As far as job satisfaction goes, it depends. Like all specialties, radiology has its drawbacks. But most radiologists I know are content. (Heck, I have never met a radiologist who isn’t.) Speaking for myself, I love it.

In fact at PG level its more than any other branch.You have to know all disease Medicine,Pedia,Surg,Ortho everything.Also its very common that various departments send your report for review. What I mean to say is that many time clinicians are suspecting different disease and on USG it came different disease ,so they will again send the patient to do the USG again and confirm again.Generally almost all people who take Radiolgy know it before hand that they will miss the “clinical feel” and treatment part and there job is somewhat with Corporate touch.Still people from different dept will try to implement that “main doctors” are the Clinicians/Surgeons and Radiologist are auxillary one.Few times it leads to frustation in Radiologist but in general almost all the Radiologist to whom I have met are satisfied with their branch.","3,438 followers",Parthiban Bala,671,388,3.1M,https://www.quora.com/In-Stargate-1994-Daniel-explained-about-7-symbols-How-does-travelling-to-Asgard-s-home-world-use-8-symbols
