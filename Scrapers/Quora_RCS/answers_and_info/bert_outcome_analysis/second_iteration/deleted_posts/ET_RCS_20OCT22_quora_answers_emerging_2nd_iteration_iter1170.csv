I don’t know why the world doesn’t understand this yet but the entire comparison is merely theoretical and in real-world, this comparison isn’t even worth the discussion.Let me settle the dust today. I am explaining here theWhy do we feel MBAs have better Communication Skills than us?I agree the feeling is mutual.Because we don’t need it. I am serious, the majority of us don’t need it.This comparison gets unnecessary focus & attention while it is not an issue as big as being presented. I don’t know why the world doesn’t understand this yet but the entire comparison is merely theoretical and in real-world, this comparison isn’t even worth the discussion.Let me settle the dust today. I am explaining here theWhy do we feel MBAs have better Communication Skills than us?I agree the feeling is mutual.What are Communication Skills we are talking here about?RATIONALEA majority of Chartered Accountants are in Practice, not ServiceIf you observe the membership data of Chartered Accountants with ICAI -Conclusion 1 - Chartered Accountants are in Service, majorly for the first five years of their career. Later, they usually practice as an independent consultant.Further, the majority of Practicing CAs are Sole Proprietors or in Small FirmsThe practising members can be segregated into the following categories - Small Firms, Medium Size Firms, Large Firms.According to ICAI’s data, only 13% of the Chartered Accountants work with Large Firms, while a large part works as Sole Proprietor or in small firms. The proportion of second-tier firms is very low.Conclusion 2 - Majority Chartered Accountants are in Practice (from the first conclusion), and out of them, a majority works in small firms or as a sole proprietor.The work environment of small firms doesn’t demand EnglishSmall firms do not have big corporates as clients. The language of communication with these kinds of clients is never English because the clients themselves are not fluent with it. Indeed, if you speak in English or speak formally, the clients rather feel uneasy. You have to communicate in Hindi or regional language, to gain their confidence. If you go to non-metro cities, the clients themselves don’t use emails. At times, their email ids are created & maintained by the Chartered Accountants for the tax purposes. When it comes to Audit, Clients are more interested in compliances rather than loopholes discovered. There are no presentations, there are no reports, no emails, no English Conversations, no hyped meetings.Conclusion 3 - So a majority of Chartered Accountants don’t even need the English Communication skills, they need just communication skills.‘Communication Skills’ vs ‘English Communication Skills’People think that speaking in English means Communication Skills while communicating in Regional languages is considered as Poor Communication Skills. This is totally wrong. Communication Skills are not restricted to certain languages. Communication Skills is not restricted to the English language. When you communicate tactfully in Hindi, Gujarati, Marathi, Marwari, Tamil or Telugu, you are still displaying excellent Communication Skills. Gaining the confidence of the client, excellently negotiating, properly explaining the procedures & speaking fluently in Regional languages are also Communication Skills. Chartered Accountants are good at this, without any doubt.Conclusion 4 - Chartered Accountants are excellent at Communication Skills required for their profession. The only difference is - they display their communication skills in Regional languages and not just English.Lion doesn’t look at deer & say, “Why don’t I have a Slim fit body?”Lions are carnivores while deer herbivores. Their lives are different and they live in different environments. Similarly, MBAs and Chartered Accountants also operate in different environments.The work profile of MBAs - MBAs usually have two options - either get a job or become an Entrepreneur. Most of them are in Jobs & their work profiles are -MBAs usually work in the Corporate world. The demand there is to communicate in English. It’s a corporate thing. They need people who communicate well. The work of MBA, if you observe from the profile mentioned above, usually either involves executing procedures & reporting or getting work done from others and then reporting. Reporting is key.Chartered Accountants have two major options - Practice & Service. Most Chartered Accountants opt for practice & their work profiles are -Majority Chartered Accountants work for small clients and deal with Tax Authorities like Sales Tax Departments where many officers can’t even type a proper letter in English. Both Clients and the Vendors (i.e. Tax departments) don’t need any kind of presentation, drafted reports, big meetings or conversations in English. Everything happens in regional languages except the documents which usually contain static information.Conclusion 5 - The environment in which majority Chartered Accountants work doesn’t require English conversations, however, in the case of MBAs, it is usually required. Hence, MBAs and not Chartered Accountants, need English speaking.CA in Service have good Communication Skills in EnglishThe Chartered Accountants in service, usually work either with Big four firms and the Corporates or with the other CA firms. The Big four firms and other Corporates hire Chartered Accountants who have good communication skills as required by them. While the CA firms who hire CA, expect good communication skills in regional languages. So usually the Chartered Accountants who are in Service have good communication skills, as the Big four firms and Corporate are very strict on this part.Conclusion 6 - It’s not that Chartered Accountants completely lack English Communication Skills. There are many who demonstrate excellence in this and are present in the Corporate world.The feeling lack of Communication Skills is only Short TermDuring this period from Articleship to Fellow membership, Chartered Accountants repeatedly feel that their communication skills are weak.Conclusion 7 - The need for English Communication Skills is short term. In the long run, Chartered Accountants usually don’t need English Communication Skills.ConclusionEnglish communication skills are not the only way of communication. Communication in Regional languages is also a skill and Chartered Accountants in practice possess the same. The need for English Communication skills is usually felt for a short term while in the long term it’s a requirement is very low as compared to MBAs. Unlike MBAs, work of majority Chartered Accountant doesn’t require high-level English Communication Skills.Lion doesn’t need a slim fit body like deer, he only needs the hunting skills.",321 followers,Siddhant Garg,1.2K,0,0,https://www.quora.com/What-do-you-do-as-a-business-analyst-and-is-it-difficult-to-pursue-a-degree-in-that-field

I have applied for the same but I am not sure when it will get approved.Regards,Aditya.",83 followers,Vikrant Singh Pawar,565,121,295.8K,https://www.quora.com/Why-do-Chartered-Accountants-in-India-seem-so-weak-in-communication-skills-compared-to-MBAs

CAs Course curriculum are drafted basically focusing on more technical part instead of presentation part. And you better know MBAs can not have better skills of Audit, Taxation and Finalization of Books of Accounts part. Even they don't have strong funadamental knowledge of Finance and Accounts, may be due to MBA's course curriculum doesn't cover it in depth because they have only 2 years duration. So mainly they focus on the presentations part in a strong way.And the main reason of better communication skills of MBAs from good business schools are as follows;Good Business schools only allow a good and intelligent candidate to take admission in that school, they only prefer creamy students, they take interview before admissions and just groom them and present in the market.So, mainly they focus to shape up that intelligent people.And on the other part, in CA, mainly a middle class and poor family participate to achieve something big, which doesn't require much money. And they also don't have better schooling, so mainly they have English speaking problems and Stage fear, which is common for many people.Also, now a days you will see many CAs doing far better than MBAs.So, Stop comparing and Judging CAs with only communication skills. Both have their separate roles.And Yes, please don't judge entire CA fraternity based on particular individual CAs, they may be facing their personal problems.Thanks..and please do upvotes if you agree with this statement.",UNKNOWN,Aparichit,927,124,573.8K,https://www.quora.com/Why-do-Chartered-Accountants-in-India-seem-so-weak-in-communication-skills-compared-to-MBAs
4,"Yes. I do agree with you that a CA in India does not have communication skills if compared to an MBA. Rather, I would say MBAs from good colleges like IIMs, ISBs, FMS, SP Jain, NMIMS etc.. Reasons are straightforward and simple. MBA is a college-based degree and CA is knowledge-based degree.Anyone would agree that a CA is more knowledgeable and experienced in his specialized fields or subjects due to focus is more on technical skills rather than presentation skill and other soft skill and basically CA curriculum/ course structured in such a manner.Diversity of subject knowledge and three yearsYes.

CAs who may be the youngest one, probably around 18/19 years old when they got touch of corporates during their internships and also at the same time they got taste of corporate culture; politics and a good work experience at a very young age.MBA where you have to do a lot of projects and group activities and there is a diversity of people (CA, IITs, Graduates) which create an environment that they get better in communication skills which are missing in a CA course except those who have done internship from Big 4s. But again, in Big 4s there are soft skill training but are not so effective.Also, the selection process of MBA colleges is an interview driven process along with your CAT and background (10th and 12th Marks; work etc), basically they are already selecting those who must have moderate soft skills whereas CA entrance is based purely on technical knowledge.But this gap gets fade away when you go on higher eschelon in your respective organisation.Each course has its own merits and demerits. Authorities should focus on how they can eliminate them. For example ICAI has recently signed MoU with IIMA for CA students for better communication skills training but a long way to go.I would end my argument by this equationCA + KNOWLEDGE = MBA + SOFT SKILLSBut it would be the best combo if a CA does an MBA from any prestige college but I know vice versa is quite difficult :)",163 followers,Umang Gupta,819,0,0,https://www.quora.com/Why-do-Chartered-Accountants-in-India-seem-so-weak-in-communication-skills-compared-to-MBAs
