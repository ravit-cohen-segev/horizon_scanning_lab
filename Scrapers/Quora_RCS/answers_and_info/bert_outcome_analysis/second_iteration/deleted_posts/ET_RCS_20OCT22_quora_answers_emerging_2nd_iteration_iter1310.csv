0,"Short answer: It’s hard. Long Answer: A variety of factors weigh heavily against going into the law profession. They include in semi-chronological order:-Taking and getting a good score on LSAT (not necessary but if you want scholarships and admission to Top Tier then your LSAT score and undergraduate grades need to be high)-Getting into a law school (not too difficult unless you go Ivy League or Top Tier)-Withstanding 3 years of law school (many students don’t make it but still have the debt, some professors are unkind but most are decent people)-Passing the MPRE (not hard if you prepare)-PasShort answer: It’s hard.

They include in semi-chronological order:-Taking and getting a good score on LSAT (not necessary but if you want scholarships and admission to Top Tier then your LSAT score and undergraduate grades need to be high)-Getting into a law school (not too difficult unless you go Ivy League or Top Tier)-Withstanding 3 years of law school (many students don’t make it but still have the debt, some professors are unkind but most are decent people)-Passing the MPRE (not hard if you prepare)-Passing the Bar Exam (the Bar Exam is not hard-it is literally going into a big room and writing and/or filling in bubbles in three hour increments. It is the long hours away from family and friends spent in a library or off on your own studying the law that will be tested that is hard)-Finding a job in the law field (not easy, most lawyers I know nowadays did not start at law firms but as public defenders, county attorneys, or JD preferred positions like contracts administrator or insurance adjuster).-Becoming a good lawyer (I don’t think that you can ever really master being a good lawyer because you still wrestle with the same frustrations, same issues, same problems as you always did. That’s what life is like).-Contending with high alcoholism, depression, suicide, substance abuse, and divorce rates.A few war stories to illustrate my points:The practice of law can be extremely rewarding both financially, personally and professionally. Google lawyer salaries in your area. Solo practitioner salaries vary widely but most private practice lawyers do pretty well. However, with this comes long hours, bringing work home with you, and the points I previously mentioned. It may not be for everyone but it is how I make my living.EDIT: One more war story:4. As a public defender, I represented juveniles charged with crimes and status offenses (things that are only offenses because of the juveniles age or “status” which include tobacco use, beyond control of parents/school, truancy, etc.). I represented a 14 year old who was charged as a habitual truant. She wouldn’t go to school. She had already been adjudicated as a habitual truant and was put on probation and had violated those terms. When this happens, the judge can put her in jail for violating a Valid Court Order. To me, this is ludicrous because she is going to jail for something that isn’t even a crime. Kentucky jails more juveniles for status offenses than any other state in the union. To me, it is insane because there are other factors contributing to why this kid doesn’t go to school- the kid may not have transportation, they may be made fun of, they may have to work the fields (especially in rural areas). In this girls case, it was several of these along with the fact that she had been sexually abused. (Side Note: The sad fact is that nearly every juvenile female I represented had been sexually abused at one point in their life. Many times it is by a family member. It really pisses me off that these girls didn’t even have an f’ing chance at life before they had to deal with all the psychological B.S. that goes with that abuse. Then everyone wonders why they act out by making bad decisions. The truth is this: These abusers are murdering their daughters. They pulled the trigger 20 years ago when they committed the abuse. It just took that long for the bullet to finally hit. ) Anyway, we had a hearing where I pointed out to the judge that the school truancy officer had not complied with the statute by not conducting an investigation into other potential causes of the girls truancy, among other things. The usual sentence for something like this was 20 days at the detention center but I presented an alternative sentencing plan which included therapy for the girl, community service, and a plan coordinated with her mother to get her to school everyday. The prosecutor asked for 20 days at the detention center, I argued that my alternative sentencing plan presented the least restrictive alternative (this is the standard under the law). The judge agreed with me and let the girl off on the terms presented. 6 months later, I saw her for her status hearing which is something the judges do to keep tabs on kids who are on probation. She was doing fine and hadn’t had an unexcused absence since our court date. She also informed me that she had named her hamster after me. So, there’s a hamster out there named “Zachary Hoskins” after the lawyer that didn’t give up and got this girl out of a scrape. Of all the honors I have had, that is the one that sticks with me the most. See what I mean…it’s rewarding.",UNKNOWN,Anonymous,1.5K,0,0,https://www.quora.com/Why-do-most-lawyers-recommend-other-people-to-not-go-into-law

All I heard from him during my childhood was his complaints about his practice; he was not happy in his work. If there was anything I knew I DID NOT WANT TO DO after college, it was “going into law.” He hated it, and frankly, knowing him and after I began practicing law, I realized that he really was not cut out to be a lawyer and was not very good at lawyering (among many other reasons, he took it too personally —- was not sufficiently detached and objective —- and he was also lousy at math).But after doing other things for over ten years after college, too many people were telling me, “I think you’d make a great lawyer. Have you ever considered going to law school?” I would tell them my experience with my father, to which most would respond, “That’s not been my experience at all.” I got intrigued, applied to law school, got in, tried it out, found it interesting and challenging, and have never look back.Going to law school would have been absolutely wrong for me to do right out of college.

With that out the way -I think a Master's in the U.S. is worth it, but read this answer and my updates on my life in the U.S. and make a decision for yourself :August 2017:I have two brothers in the USA.One of them had many backlogs in U.G. back home in India. After a heavy debate with his family, he moved to North Carolina and studied M.S. in E.E. at UNCC. He found E.E. too hard, wrote another SOP, and transferred to C.S. after going there. Yeah, so he's not some extraordinary person, but he changed after going to the USA. He graduated but without a stable job offer. He jumped around and got into Apple, now a senior software engineer at Bank of America.My brothers always tell me, ""I will not guarantee you a secure life if you come to the USA. That part is in your hands, but the education here makes you realize what real education is: learning, curiosity, and passion.""If you are looking for all that, perhaps the USA is a good choice. Then again, research what M.S. you want to do and whether they have quality education in that program. Not all M.S. programs are good in the USA.Whether you will settle down comfortably after graduation depends on how much effort you put into your M.S. I have spoken to unemployed Carnegie Mellon and Illinois Institute of Technology students who earn 60–65 grand per annum. There is no proper structure to the job market there. So if someone tells you that you'll get a great life in the USA if you just get admission to a top university, they are lying.EDIT: (February 2019 ):EDIT 1 (March 2019)EDIT 2 (August 3rd, 2019 )Meanwhile, I know about three people interning for Verizon. and 2 for Qualcomm. 1 for oracle, and about 10–15 in local Boston companies. There are bad apples here as well. My friend is still searching for an internship in the Fall or spring. My seniors got into Juniper, Facebook, etc. Not bad.I think I'd be lying if I said luck was not a factor. It sucks, I know, but that's how it is. I was as active on LinkedIn as on Instagram to boost my luck. Post. Share stuff relevant to your stream. Connect with senior engineers and alumni. Try talking with people more so than applying for jobs online.Do I want to continue working in the U.S.? Absolutely. Will I? Who knows? I made a billion assumptions when I landed in Aug 2018, many of which were correct and wrong on many levels. What is certain is that I love every second of it here and will cherish these moments till I die.My next edit would be the story after I graduate in 2020. I will tell you as it happened, whether good or bad. I will start my 2020 full-time job hunt this week. Let's see how it goes. :DEDIT 3 (October 5th, 2019 )I have converted my internship to a full-time job at Dell. I go from being an intern to a Senior Network Analyst position because I have a Masters's degree.Now, you guys have lived through my journey.I like Network Engineering, and employers seem to think I know my shit. My resume is pretty weak, to be honest. There are very few coding languages and zero previous work ex ( excluding Dell co-op ), but I know everything I have on my current resume.I also have a full-time interview process with Facebook, but I am not too hopeful. I'll let you all know if something happens.My Manager said that there might be a recession coming. He said I am still not immune to the recession even after I get full-time. I urge you to research a bit on this and how it may affect your stream in the next two years. I, too, am doing the same. Remember, we are all on temporary visas. Anything can happen. So make the best out of the time you get. Learn as much as you can.My brother got a job amidst the '08 recession. He knows his stuff because he likes coding, and he still does. He could market his skill even when jobs were at an all-time low.Is MS in the U.S. worth it?I think so. I am not whining about Engineering as I did in India, which is a vast improvement.There is always a risk in this, though. Do not believe in people who always glorify M.S. There are dark stories too. I had many days messaging people on LinkedIn like a madman and got no responses. My profile looks fancy, but it took a lot of bruises to get here. I remember I was about to fail two subjects at one point because I forgot the most critical assignment in both! But I somehow worked hard and pulled through.Ultimately, it's about how much you like what you are doing. That's it. The more you want it, the more effort you will put in. Don't join M.S. in C.S. with Machine Learning courses because ML is a hot topic. Find something you like to do. It's a significant factor when you are applying for M.S. The Statement of purpose, an application document, aims to voice your interest to the admissions committee. Do not hire someone to write it for you, defeating its purpose.I suppose that's it for my journey. I hope I have given you the answer you were looking for.This is purely my perspective and my opinion only. You are free to disagree.EDIT (April 7th, 2020, COVID-19)I thought I completed this answer but had to type this edit. The Novel Coronavirus has given the U.S. the most significant blow since 2008. Linkedin has become so sad and depressing with all this.What can I say to prospective students?While it is my opinion and experience that there is always aWhat became of my job offer mentioned above? Nothing changed. The company I joined is large enough to pay me, and I am not affected by my employment.I still have a good two months before joining, and I hope the U.S. will contain it before it reaches 1 million cases.Time will tell.EDIT (June 22nd, 2020, New job and other news )Today I have initiated my employment with my employer, Dell Tech. And I am currently using the work permit known as the F1-OPT work permit, which allows me to work for three years in a company that is willing to hire International Students on non-immigrant visas.Also, President Donald J Trump has signed an executive order in response to the economic impacts caused by the Coronavirus and has decided to suspend the H1B, L, J, and H2B visas through December 31st, 2020.What does this mean to me? Well.. not much because I wasn't selected for the H1B this year. I lost the lottery. However, I think it would have been fine even if I was chosen for the lottery because when you read the executive order,Proclamation Suspending Entry of Aliens Who Present a Risk to the U.S. Labor Market Following the Coronavirus Outbreak | The White House.. it says it will only affect those currentlyHe has not acted on the work permit I have, which is the OPT. OPT is in a weird situation where four Republican senators, along with many colleagues, urged Pres. Trump to suspend it.Republicans Urge President Trump to Restrict Immigration Further for New Petitions for H-1B Workers, H-2B Workers, OPT Students, and EB-5 InvestorsSuddenly, 21 republican house reps urged him to keep it alive because it would hurt college admissions in the Fall and beyond.House GOP Immigration Letter Backs OPT For International Students2020 elections are going to be very interesting. Trump is behind the polls as Biden leads it not because of his policies but mostly because he is not trumped, which is bad news for Joe. We all thought Hillary would win because she wasn't trump, and look how that turned out!So my thoughts? Big companies have a way of retaining talent and can place them in various parts of the world that medium to small size companies…. don't have. I explained basic logic but being an ""alien"" in this country makes it harder for you to experience that exciting startup culture because of all these visa tensions (see above). So big companies are better, but how hard is it to open their doors? Not impossible, but not easy. Start focusing on internships when you get here. If you can get one, try your very best to convert. Work smart! Linkedin is the new Instagram.My roommate lost the H1B lottery all three years of his OPT and had to return to India in 2018! But what did the company (Amazon) do? They sent him to the E.U. branch. Then they brought him back to the U.S. on the L1 visa again. All because they liked his work ethic, and he got results. They could have sent him to Hyderabad, though, and maybe there were no requirements or projects. Anyway, the point is they didn't give up on him.When I first wrote the answer, I admit I was excited to go to the U.S. (even if I didn't realize it ), but some fear also accompanied my decision. I did enter the country when Trump was at his peak. My attempt to relinquish the attachment to this country is the one thing that has brought me this far and is immune to everything. My mentor at Dell always tells me, ""If anything happens to you, we all will be sad, Bala. But the company will replace you and move on."" Once I changed my approach and started to self-analyze, I realized more and more people began to engage with me. In my limited experience conversing with colleagues and other employees from Google, Uber, and Facebook: People want to get things done and not waste time pretending to know something they don't or go after something they can't control. I like that.Is MS in the U.S. worth it? Yes. That is, as of now, my answer. Heck of a fantastic experience. Will I change my answer? No clue.EDIT (July 7th, 2020):The latest news on restrictions on F1 visa students has stirred up some worry. Here's the deal: If you want to enroll in classes in fall 2020 or start your journey in fall 2020, you must make sure that you attend classes in person or have a hybrid semester where you can enroll in one online course and then have the other in person.SEVP modifies temporary exemptions for non-immigrant students taking online courses during the fall 2020 semesterYou must enroll in at least eight credits per semester as an M.S. student.

You can take more than one online class and have an on-ground course if you prove to USCIS that you are not enrolling in aI have flown to other citiesThis year, your poker cards are like a pair of 2s, and the U.S. has a pair of kings. You made your first bet by paying for applications. The first three flips are an Ace, Queen, and a Jack. The next bet is your enrollment to fall 2020, and the final one is your bet on getting a job. The cards are not in your favor, but it's poker. You could get a four-of-a-kind or a three-of-a-kind, and the last flip would be some random card.Is MS in the U.S. worth it? I still think it is, but you should wait for fall 2021 to have aIf you have already committed to M.S., I suggest you understand safety protocols and start updating your LinkedIn, contact alumni of the university you are about to join, and keep them in the loop. Be on the lookout for internships at the companies where your alumni work. Also, connect to other full-time employees on LinkedIn for companies you'd like to work for. I got referrals from entirely random people for Facebook.The job I have now at Dell is the one I gotGood luck, guys.EDIT (July 14thAmong so many others, Harvard University lawyers sued the hell out of ICE ( Immigration and Customs Enforcement ). They reversed the rule of deportation of F1 students, and now Students can study entirely online.BTW, She is my favorite lawyer ever. Follow her if you haven't already.I know better than not to piss off people in Boston, let alone Harvard.As a visa holder, I can tell you this stuff keeps comingOh, and my suggestion is still to defer your admits to 2021, and I stand by the reasons mentioned in the previous edits. Whatever the visa issues, the U.S. economy is still recovering. Research your specific stream and talk to students and professionals about what is happening.Good luck, guys.EDIT (July 24th,I told you there would be a backlash of some sort, and not even days later, after the reversal of the student ban, there are new developments forNote: This won't affect you if you are already in the U.S.ICE Confirms New Foreign Students Can't Take Online-Only Course Loads In The U.S.So, you might say that you could ride it out in your country. After all, you don't have to pay the expensive rent and whatnot, but I am not sure what will happen with your eligibility to apply for an internship or a full-time job after these adjustments. You may want to email your university and ask about any changes in Curriculum Practical Training and Optional Practical Training work permits given to students like yourself.These two work permits allow you to work as an intern and full-time. Research carefully and move forward. The fourth poker card is now a Jack. The U.S. has two pairs with 2 Kings, and 2 Jacks already flipped on the board. You have only 2 Twos, and you need the last flip to be a 2 for a three-of-a-kind.If you don't understand what I am talking about, to put it short: You are at a disadvantage.However, even in this situation, success is still somewhat within reach. You must decide whether to delay this whole thing by deferring or if you want to walk the wild side and dance with uncertainty—your choice. There are no right or wrong decisions because every decision has consequences, and you have to choose the one with lesser adverse effects.Is MS in the U.S. worth it? Well, I am being forced by circumstances to say no. Still, I will rephrase and say, ""If there is a pandemic, an obvious economic downturn that a baby could frown at the graph of jobs and infections, andI will update the thread if universities draw out the swords they just sheathed and wage another war against ICE.EDIT (August 10th,2020 )I was having a casual conversation with my co-worker, an American. We talked about the complex process of legal immigration when he brought up my work permit and wanted to know the process involved in getting one.I applied (i.e., mailed the application) for an F1-OPT work permit on March 13th and received approval for my OPT work permit on April 16th. By April 23rd, I got my Work permit card delivered to my address. If for some reason, I had applied a month later than March 15th,So, the question would be whether or not I would have lost my job. When I asked my Manager, he said he would have waited for a couple more months. My situation wouldn't have been terrible, but it could have been worse, and I got lucky again.How likely is the possibility of me applying one month later? Not likely, and here's why. The OPT work permit can be applied no sooner than 90 days before graduation orSo, be aware of these things as well. University will send you an email 90 days before graduating, but I'm not sure if you guys are as meticulous in checking every email in your inbox.I would like you all to do this:EDIT (August 14th, 2020: A surprise)I am happy to share that IThis second-round concept is new this year because, believe it or not, the number of H1B slots was still empty after the first round! Shocking!!! Usually, it gets filled within days, and there would be an enormous applicant pool for just 85000 visas.Oh, if you are wondering how I got this visa when the Trump admin is currently banning it until December 31st, 2020, I am already in the U.S., which means I have an existing visa called F1-OPT, so I am eligible for the H1B. The ban only affects those who are currently residing outside the U.S. (i.e., if you don't already have an existing work/student visa, i.e., you are someone who is living in another country and are trying to enter the U.S. with an H1B which allows you to work for the company sponsoring you)Okay, I need to explain a few things here. First off, I would like to tell you all that if you get a full-time offer from an employer who says they will sponsor you and that the offer letter date is at leastThis isSome rewardsSome challenges you might face :I'm getting into all of this during a pandemic, and I realize this may pose some risk, but if you've read this answer, you know that risk-taking is a part of living in the U.S. My Manager told me yesterday that I'm being too hard on myself and overthinking too much over tiny mistakes. I think that applies to my life in the U.S. too. Maybe I, you, and others are overthinking too much. I get it; there's a lot of money involved.I may have changed my mind a few times throughout writing this answer, and I'm not hiding thatAt one point, research has to stop, and you have to go and just do it.EDIT (August 18th, 2020, Some common questions):A lot of you have been asking meBeyond the top 10/20 of whatever website you use should be treated more or less the same except for one factor: How is XYZ university goodThe subject ranking is sadly subjective (but somewhat accurate) on the internet, so it's best to talk to students via LinkedIn and make an informed decision.Is GRE the most crucial aspect? Is LOR the most crucial aspect? Is SOP the most crucial aspect?Again, these are some of the questions I received, and honestly, I can say that all of them are important.Don't think about compromising one or the other.EDIT (September 29th,A few folksLinkedIn and my parents are the reasons why I have low debt now. I still have a financial obligation, but it's not a lot, to be honest. My parents saved for many years; that money was just enough for 50% of tuition because Boston is freaking expensive. The rest was a gamble. They would either have to give everything they had, retirement, and even more, or I would have to get a job and fund myself. I did the latter. I got an internship ( thanks to the research I did pre-flight to America ), which was a little over a 7-month internship and paid a very high salary. Tuition fees are covered. Living was the only thing I borrowed, so I still owe money in that department.Now, getting a long-term internship and having a high salary is not something you'd come across in smaller and smaller companies. This is sad, but it is what it is. However, if the startup is promising, I hear they pay competitive salaries in places like the bay area. Still, if you move to the bay area, you must partition your salary into living expenses. However, I will say that there are companies that[OFFICIAL] Salary Sharing thread for INTERNS:: March 2020Check that link. Some salaries are way higher than I got. Also, I believe these salaries are pre-tax. However, remember that the taxes you pay in the internship would be later in the returns you get the following year when you file for taxes. So suppose I paid 10,000$ in taxes, and I get some 3,500–4000 back, depending on the state. Keep this all in mindI learned in America that it isAgain. No guarantee. Just a possibility.Good luck!EDIT (October 29th, 2020 - H1B changes )I'm not going to say too much about the latest changes, but here's an excellent summary of what is the difference aboutSo basically, they found sour grapes in I.T. consulting companies and decided to change the wages. Big companies are fine but smaller ones?Let's see what happens. There are always lawsuits. Keep reading. I won the lottery but didn't get the visaEDIT (June 20th, 2021 - The masks are off )I am about seven months into the H1B visa, the Coronavirus is finally on its way out, and we have had a new president since my last edit. I do not think Pres Biden will look into legal immigration improvements shortly. He is looking more into illegal immigration, so I'm unsure if his arrival is good or bad for immigrants. He doesn't look or talk anti-immigration, but the actions reflect a politician's stance, not words.My life has been more or less the same since the last edit. I transferred over to the H1B as mentioned above. I did make a mistake in filing taxes which suddenly made me eligible for stimulus checks. The stimulus check is only for U.S. residents, i.e., those who have been in the U.S. for some time on the H1B. The number of years you are on an F1 visa is not counted, so you are not a resident of the U.S. I will have to amend my tax returns and give the IRS about 3200$ (the stimulus amount, so I am not paying out of my pocket, but rather giving back what they gave me).Anywho - Life's good. The job market is healing, and I see more people getting employment in STEM. I was pleased that over 95% of my batch mates in 2020 have jobs. Not sure about the rest as they didn't update their LinkedIn. People, please update your LinkedIn whenever you get a job or promotion. It's not a show-off but a map for others to read and see how you have grown.I started a monthly post on LinkedIn to help people with referrals in my company. A few of them got job offers and interviews etc. Giving back is fun! I encourage you to do it.My next step is applying for the I-140, which is the step before getting the green card. It should take a year and a half to get this filed and approved.Back to normal, I guess. I'll let you know if anything changes in my journey.EDIT (September 17th, 2021 - Job Market for XYZ field )Nearly 8–10 people recently asked a recurring question - ""How do I research whether my field is booming or not? ""I gave them a task to do, which I will share with you.Contact these people either on Linkedin or anywhere.The idea is to talk with people who have walked the path you want to walk on and learn from their successes and mistakes. Remember that many people might not respond, but if you have a few souls who take the time to respond, then you are sorted.Make sure that once you graduate from M.S. and have a good job, you take some time to help those who follow you because someone helped you become who you are, and I believe we must repay the favor to society.So… is M.S. in the U.S. worth it in September 2021? My answer is Yes! You are free to form your opinions. However, remember there are always risks ( you get the idea ). I keep repeating the wordGood luck, guys!EDIT (April 5th, 2022 - H1B Visa Stamping. First time flying to India) :I spent months in the USA to try and get an appointment for visa stamping in my home city (Chennai), and I succeeded!! The USCIS declared that until December 31st, 2022, all H-1B stamp appointments shall entail only the submission of required documents for the visa for review, and all interviews are waived. They will take the docs and passport for assessment, and then it takes up to 15 days to return the passport with a stamp, or they will request more information to verify the authenticity of your application. This allowed a considerable population to fly back and forth from the USA to their Home Country.And so…After four years in the USA, I finally touched down in India on March 26th for 40 days before I flew back to Boston in May. There are specific rules for staying away from the USA for a more extended period since I also work remotely and still earn U.S. dollars. My immigration team suggested 40 days, out of which I will take four days off as vacation. There is no point in taking a holiday in India because I get total freedom to spread my workload as I please.Pro tip if you're flying to India or wherever- I recommend looking into Google Fi*. I don't pay a single cent* Google Fi is inherently expensive (10$ per G.B.), but you should keep in mind that we have things like an Xfinity hotspot spread across Boston, so phone data is rarely used. I pay only 25 dollars a month because I don't use it much. If you're someone who streams JRE on Spotify or watches 4K videos at the beach, run away from Google Fi because you'll pay a lot more than 25$ a month.I should also create an NRE/NRO account in India to benefit from more interest rates. U.S. banks are not known for interest rates; hence, folks transfer money to an NRE account (If you want to manage in dollars ) and NRO account ( If you're going to convert to rupee and operate in that account. Good for parents to use and you can give them a debit card and they can manage expenses)Life's pretty much okay otherwise. I hate this inflation, though. Gas prices have risen, and my rent is stupidly high, so I am moving to another apartment. I see more people interested in M.S. in the USA again, so the F1 visa group is growing, but not as much as during the Obama period.Good luck, guys! The USA is a beautiful, flawed, lucrative, risky, emotional, robotic, fair, unfair, warm, and cold country. It's not for everyone, but it's my cup of tea. I hope my edits are helping you all. Reach out on LinkedIn if you think you need more details.EDIT (September 16th, 2022 - Let’s Talk Facts) :Over the last five years I’ve had the pleasure of conversing about all things US Immigration, safety laws, philosophy of success, etc. There’s one topic I found myself to be repeating and that’s explaining how the visa process works from F-1 visa all the way to the Green Card.I wrote an article on LinkedIn to explain everything there’s to know about the yardsticks you need to cross in this journey.Note : The above link will not work if you are not signed in on LinkedInGood luck guys!EDIT ( Contact )Note : The above link will not work if you are not signed in on LinkedIn. Also if I don't respond to DMs, then most likely I'm on a LinkedIn break. Check my latest post to see if I announced that I am taking a break because I do that sometimes.Click the three dots in my profile and give me a connect if you don't see the connect button.EDIT (Mistakes in Answer)EDIT (Touching up):P.S.: After participating in many debates about India vs. the USA, I think I am tired.

They maybe. But what they won’t tell you is what their families had to go through during the time when they took that hefty loan to live their “dreams”. Coming from a middle class background, I did the same thing took a loan of almost 50 lakhs, applied to one of the top programs in one of the top most universities in the US. Began my course, excelled in assignments etc, etc. But every day when I would wake up, this thought would haunt me about what situation my family must be living in India to let me live a decent life in an apartment with daily grocery needs and the amount of compromises they must be having to make just so that I can study in an university in the US and have a good student life. And this very thought began to eat me up, I wasn’t financially independent(which I had when I worked in India). But rather now I was going into a debt crisis with a “hope” that I will end up in some job somewhere and be able to repay my loan and bring prosperity. I took up a on campus job, because the way you’ve taken TA/RA for granted in your question, it is not at all easy to get one. Let me tell you 5 years of your life will just go in breaking even with the amount of expense that goes in for your MS.And what for all this? So that you can live in the USA? You have literally ripped your family of its financial independence just so that you can go and study in some big university in the US. Also, this may not apply to everyone as I saw a lot of my classmates were coming from good backgrounds and had enough money to be able to afford to sustain financially as these were kids of successful businessmen in India. I’m definitely not talking about that class of people but referring to middle/average/below middle class students who see others who have gone abroad and earned well for themselves and base their decisions on those observations and take hefty loans and have parents who are in service.I would suggest, rather figure out your individuality and look for something you want to really do in life rather than just following the trend. US is not the only go to success option in the world. A lot of people in India have made amazing careers and shine worldwide. So stop believing in cliches and start believing in yourself. And please do a favour to your parents. Don’t put them in a debt crisis because they have anyway struggled their entire life to get you till this point. Don’t add further problems in their life.

Like what I explained, I am sure you would have your own reasons to pursue MS. Love those reasons, they will support you morally.Now coming to your financial concern. Yes, you are going to spend all those hard earned money of yours!. I myself have a hefty loan back home. I didn't get a TA/GA as my GRE mark was low compared to my peers. I worked for part-time in the university dining services. Yes it was a difficult job. But none of this did matter to me because I loved my course so much. Days rolled by, semesters rolled by and finally I graduated!!!!... That feeling you get when you graduate with a master degree. You are going to love that, my friend!Present Day -  I am a consultant working for one of the Big 4 consulting firms and paying off my loans as swiftly as I can.

After graduating, you would earn closer to 4000$ per month. You can easily pay off your loans, buy an excellent car, rent an apartment, eat out, go clubbing, and still save around 800-1000$ a month. Even if you send half of that to your parents, they will get more than what you could have given to them while in India.All in all, this was all related to investment. On top of that, the excellent education you get, the networking you make with alumni's are definitely worth taking the risk.I would say take the leap of faith, if you believe in your abilities and believe you can  do it.

Don’t believe them. The generation of our Fathers/Uncles was inexperienced and stupid. Remember it’s the same generation who led you to believe that “The world has changed, a lot. Americans are one of the most hardworking people I’ve ever met. American students make sure that they get a chance to work with a Professor by talking to them, they are good at that. More than that, I’ve 85–90 Korean/Chinese/Japanese students who will work 18 hours a day to make sure that they come out better than you, and they do.I’ve friends who topped their respective state universities in India, but got 0/100 in Microsoft’s test on programming. Don’t think that you know programming. More than half the world is better than you.#2 Jobs are not easyI know an Environmental Engineer who somehow applied to 2000+ companies in a period of 6 months. I know a couple of Information Systems students who applied to various jobs (more than 1500) in 9 months before getting a call for an interview. I remember applying to 10 companies in India and getting a job. India has more jobs. I study in a reputable university in US whose CS used to be one of the best till ‘85. Out of 100, hardly 10 get an internship. Don’t think that there are millions of opportunities in USA.#3 Jobs are not for youI study in Mechanical Engineering and I expected that number of companies for Mechanical Engineering would be fewer than CS/IT/MIS. Wrong. We’ve the same jobs.The problem is here.When Career Fair came last year, I was excited to see 120+ companies on day one in the fair for Mechanical alone. For CS there were around 130+. But here is the scene. They have various criteria such as, US Citizen/State Licence/Min work exp in US based company/Non-Alien resident/Only for Undergrads etc. I shortlisted according to these criteria and there turned out to be only 5/120 companies where I can go. So, for a class of 95/100 immigrants there were 5 companies, and for 5 Americans there were 115/120. Cool huh?#4 You don’t know shitWhen you enter a class in Grad studies, specially a field with a lot of math in it (Aeronautics/Mechanical/Electrical etc) they expect you to know MATLAB, Mathematica, Pro-E, CATIA, ANSYS, MAPLE, Simulink, CFD along with all the tools which you probably have never even heard of. First lecture will finish the course more than you studied in entire semester in India. Your life will be worse and you will think of going back to India. You fight. You clear the test. You may even get a good grade. In the end you will realize you still don’t know shit.Trust me, you don’t know shit.#5 Get ready for Stress/DepressionYou come from a place where mom made you good food every day and threw dishes for the maid to clean up at the end of the day. Your parents went grocery shopping and all you did was to make them cry internally by throwing away their food.Buckle up. You’ve to make your own food now. You’ll start living on bread and milk. You will get annoyed/frustrated before and after the job of consuming food. You’ve to walk a mile to get groceries and carry 10 kg of it in your hand and walk in snow 2 feet deep. Your nose will start bleeding sometime due to that cold. You used to order a pizza from Pizza Hut/Domino's in India worth 150Rs in a single call when you were hungry; now you can’t. The minimum cost of pizza comes to around 15$ and including service tax, delivery charge, tip it comes around 21$ = 1500Rs, which you can’t afford. So you walk a mile to buy a pizza, just to save tip+delivery charge of 5$. It sucks.You’ll constantly hear angry shouts of your senior roommates to clean up the mess you made in the kitchen. You’ve a debt with a bank in India and your grades suck worse than a vacuum cleaner, you will find only one way.Jack Daniels.Jack Daniels, Evan Williams, Corona, Budweiser, Irish Whiskey Tullamore Dew, Absolute Russian Vodka, Bud Light, Royal Challengers, in the worst case, Cocaine/Heroin will become your partners. You will drink until you pass out or when you get in the bed, you will feel like the bed is trying to throw you away.I never smoked in India. Now I smoke like there is nothing else in the life. Why? It fucking helps. It feels like vomiting your whole day’s shits in the smoke while throwing away puffs of smoke from the basement window out in the air.Welcome Depression.I lived there for 9 months, severely depressed that my legs stopped working for me in the morning when I wanted to wake up, I suddenly decided to take a break from all these shits. I called my sister in California and told her that I was tired and I needed a break. She booked a flight for me to India immediately that night. It cost her a lot money to get tickets, but she did it anyway. She knew what I was talking about. She had been in the same situation 7 years ago when she was studying Bio-medical Engineering in Arlington, Texas. She didn’t question me a thing and she understood my silence.

18,"It’ll be tough.Forget about all the excess baggage for a while - the huge tuition costs, the two-digit interest rate on the education loan or the constant fear about what Donald Trump may tweet about the H1B program as he takes a dump the next morning.You will clean the one toilet bowl shared by 4 people in your tiny apartment, run out of time while cooking the next meal and make a dash for the 8 a.m. lecture in the middle of a snowstorm. Everything will seem expensive because of the crazy exchange rate.

Everything will seem expensive because of the crazy exchange rate. You’ll apply to 100 companies in a day for a shot at an internship or a co-op and smile a little less with every rejection that flies into your inbox. You’ll probably disguise your dissatisfaction with the minimum-wage on-campus office assistant job when you talk to your parents on the phone. And quite annoyingly, everyone back home will think you are living an enviable life.The crazy deadlines for assignments and projects will make sure that you won’t catch enough Zzs. You’ll wish you had more than 24 hours in a day.And you’ll miss home. One night, you’ll probably wake up from a nightmare, calling your parents out in the dark. Then you'll realize that you’re a thousand miles away. You’ll call them every day, reassuring your mom that you’re having your 3 nutritious meals, and telling your dad that you’re becoming stronger and more independent every day. You’ll miss fighting with your siblings. You’ll dread opening Facebook during Diwali and Holi.But it’ll be worth it.You’ll learn more in a week here than you could have in an entire year back in your country. You’ll meet someone from a different nation every day. You’ll meet a community of brilliant and ambitious students and you’ll bond over the same shared experiences. If you loved Dominos back in India, wait till you visit all those events giving out free food (mostly pizza) just for showing up. You’ll get used to how everyone in the US is extremely nice and you’ll probably start minding your Ps and Qs, much to the surprise of your friends back home.And then, one day, you’ll get that coveted job. After a few months, you’ll rock that tassel and the graduation cap. Your family will be proud and wouldn’t stop raving about you. And you’ll wonder how all that time went by quickly.Barely two years ago, you arrived in a strange land, scared of the future, scared of being left alone and doubting your decision to come to the US.You probably wouldn’t be able to relate to what I’m talking about, but after a few years, decked in that brightly colored graduation robe, you’ll know that taking the giant leap was worth it.","1,793 followers",Naqqash Abbassi,675,275,2.1M,https://www.quora.com/Is-an-MS-in-the-USA-really-worth-investing-in-for-an-Indian-The-expenses-to-be-covered-while-pursuing-an-MS-is-a-huge-amount-especially-for-middle-class-Indians-who-rely-on-bank-loans-scholarships-or-TA-RA-to-cover-the-expense
