They paid one month’s security and the first month’s rent in advance. For the first year, everything was good.I should have known something was up after the first year. They started paying rent late. They balked when I enforced the late fee on the late payments. I didn’t renew the lease, so after the first year, they became month-to-month tenants. At one point the rent was two months late. I suggested they start looking for a new home and move if they couldn’t pay rent on a timely basis. Denise told me she had a job with Mellon Bank and things were going to be straightened out soon.That turned out to be a lie. I had to evict them through the courts. I went to the house the day they moved out and couldn’t believe my eyes. They changed the locks on the door. I had to call a locksmith. While I waited, one of the neighbors told me she watched them throw the refrigerator and stove into a dumpster. I walked around the house. The garage windows in the back of the house were all broken, I peeked into the basement windows and noticed the washer and dryer were gone. What else could go wrong?While the locksmith was changing the lock on the front door, he pointed to his wrists. His arms and wrists were covered in fleas. We both looked at our feet and ran off the porch. He apologized for not being able to finish the job. I called a realtor friend of mine who brought cans of bug spray so we could do a walkthrough. The louvered closet doors were all kicked in. The carpets were ruined by dog urine and feces. My hardwood floors were scratched and gouged. Fleas were in every room. If there was something the former tenants could damage, they found it.I was numb. I couldn’t believe they were so vindictive when all I asked them to do was pay the rent on time and treat the house as if it was theirs. At that point, I seriously doubted the “glowing” reference from their previous landlord. I realized he just wanted to get rid of them. My realtor said the damage was so extensive, I was looking at approximately $15,000 to make repairs so it was liveable.Years went by, and I eventually forgot about that little nightmare. I’m not and never was in Alcoholics Anonymous, but the Serenity Prayer helped to keep my head in a good place. “Not my circus, not my monkeys” would have worked, too. I moved to Florida but always read the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette online to keep up with hometown news.This is the headline I will never forget.Former Mellon Bank employees sentenced for tax return shreddingTwo former Mellon Bank employees charged as part of the tax-return shredding case in 2001 were sentenced to probation yesterday in federal court.Denise Philpott, 52, of Shaler, was ordered to serve three years probation, including six months home detention, and perform 100 hours of community service.David Bryant, who was the midnight shift supervisor in Mellon's processing facility, received the same sentence.Mellon had a contract with the Internal Revenue Service and Financial Management Service beginning in 1993 to serve as a processing center for tax returns, vouchers and checks received in Pittsburgh. Most of those came from upstate New York and New England.But in 2001, as the April 29 deadline approached, there were still tens of thousands of returns left to process. A manager at the center realized they would never complete the work, and she ordered employees to hide and shred them.In all, 77,000 tax returns were destroyed. Eight former employees have been charged.Four have pleaded guilty and four others still have their charges pending.Ms. Philpott and Mr. Bryant were the first to be sentenced. They faced a possible prison term of 21 to 27 months, but the government moved for a reduction because both defendants provided substantial assistance in the case.After listening to Mr. Bryant apologize for his role in the crime, U.S. District Judge Gary L. Lancaster asked him, ""The one question everybody has, how did you think you were going to get away with this?""""There was no thought involved, really,"" answered Mr. Bryant, 41, of Wilkinsburg. ""I can remember on the 28th of April, everything happened so fast.""He said he got a call from his supervisor telling him what to do.""Myself and the other manager, we just did it.""As part of a federal investigation into the matter, Mellon agreed to pay $18.1 million to cover the costs for interest lost from the time the checks were shredded to when replacements were sent, as well as the cost to move the processing contracts.Then, in June, Mellon Financial Corp. agreed to pay $16.5 million to cover civil damages and penalties from violations of the False Claims Act.Pittsburgh Post-GazetteThe lesson, boys and girls, is this:——-Edit——-The rent I charged the tenants at the beginning of the lease was the exact amount of my mortgage payment, including the property taxes.

My security clearance was being renewed (yep, this was not caught in the initial background investigation!), and everything was going swimmingly. The biggest issue I ran into was that my primary investigator was new and the interview took a long time because she was still figuring things out. I had lived in all of my homes over the last 10 years for long enough that neighbors remembered me and told the investigators that I was not up to anything suspicious. Then, out of the blue, the investigator calls me and says we need to meet to discuss one last thing. I was about to leave town for vacation, so we had to hustle to agree on a time and place…a bit inconvenient, but it ultimately worked out. I had no idea what she could possibly want to talk about, I assumed it was related to the property investing I do. I can imagine an investigator giving the side-eye to someone in my position having the kind of cash I do (from buying a couple properties cheap and ending up in a very good position due to DC’s population and consequent housing boom), but it was all perfectly documented, so I figured, “no big deal.”When she arrives to the meeting, she asks me if I had ever done business with said family business. The following (not verbatim, but close) conversation ensues:Me: “Well, not business so much. I worked for them for a winter break in college.”Her: “Oh, and about how much did they pay you during that time?”Me: “I really don’t remember exactly since it was over 10 years ago. I think they paid me $6.50 an hour, and I worked 40 hours a week for 6 weeks. {does math in head} So I guess they paid me $1500 or so during that time. Look, I know they were up to some shady stuff since a friend let me know the state went after them and closed them down only a couple years after I worked there. Can you please tell me what this is about, and I’ll see what I can do to show you I honestly just worked there?”Her: “Well, they reported that they paid you out over $18,000 in one lump sum around {date}. Can you explain that?”Me: “No, except to say that the date in your records would be only 2 days after I left that job. I assume they committed some kind of fraud in my name.”Her: “If you never participated in the transaction, they sure did commit some kind of fraud. It’s not noted as a taxable transaction, so you’re not in any kind of trouble. It’s categorized as you selling them personal property, and appears to be a vehicle. My only question was how a college student would own a vehicle worth that much.”Me: “I didn’t, and if you pull DMV records, you’ll see that at that time I owned a 6-year-old car I bought used for $8,000 just the year prior. All that information should be readily available from state tax and registration records.”Her: “I pulled those records, and that is what I found. You’re fine, though you might want to let the {state} Attorney General know about this. Even though they’re out of business, they did commit fraud in your name and you don’t want to get caught up in that mess.”The karma was, of course, that the state had already found them out and ran them out of business and, from what I saw and heard, all their money. I did send an email to the state AG, but they never even responded besides the automated “we have received your communication” email.",UNKNOWN,Pallavi,15.1K,495,8.8M,https://www.quora.com/Were-you-ever-screwed-over-by-someone-you-trusted-and-you-had-the-pleasure-of-seeing-their-Karma-on-the-TV-news-and-in-newspapers

I'm a nerdy, matronly — now rather elderly — writer and scholarly sort. But I am an activist and a political animal from a family of the same.It had been in that first year at Tor, in 2006, when I got an email from this guy wanting to set up a project using our software for an anonymous source drop box for journalism. You can imagine I found this an intriguing idea.Back in the day, such correspondence would be physical and signed, and perhaps that first interchange between Tor and WikiLeaks, signed by Julian Assange, would auction on eBay for a pretty penny. Now it's a story.Regardless, WL turned out to be more focused on secrets than privacy. They were less focused on protecting sources, initially entirely not focused on redaction to protect innocents (ironic since their initial big debut was titled with wordplay related to “collateral damage”), and more focused on the ideological punishment of those they deemed bad actors — a trend that became more apparent over time.What had been presented as a neutral facility for any journalist started to look like a facility by which anonymous hit jobs could be curated from information which often could not be independently verified or refuted. And then media frenzies were whipped up around the hit jobs, but not anything else.And for expressing these misgivings, I got reamed by the hacker community and a good deal of the press, who were pretty high on leaks and continue to be so rather indiscriminantly.Well, anyone who knows me knows I'm not one to back down from a rational case based on an opposing emotional consensus.It took about a decade, I suppose.The press has turned against Julian — most of them equally on the basis of herd instinct as before — but still I've taken some special pleasure in tracking his downfall since the 2016 elections, when I was taking real abuse in my communities for criticizing his releases of the DNC/Podesta emails and propagation of murder conspiracy theories regarding Seth Rich. That was when he moved from flawed ego to useful idiot or asset in my assessment.But yes, this is one I get to track nearly daily, and in many ways I pity the man.

It is so rare that when you work with someone who is reliable, you never ever want to work with anyone else.  You will do anything to keep that person on your team.Doing what you say you are going to do starts with setting the right expectations.  If you tell someone you will get them the deliverable by Tuesday, you need to understand that it can actually be delivered by Tuesday.  If you are good, you are probably factoring in slack in case someone in corporate slows you down or your child gets sick.And so if your boss wants something done Monday and you think it cannot be done until Wednesday, you need to be up-front.  Because once a date is agreed to, you're on the hook for accomplishing it.On the less-skilled end of the job spectrum, many people cannot commit to showing up to work consistently and on time.

To me, being emotionally intelligent and self-aware means that you have the ability to read people and their body language, and to understand the best way to approach each person. At work, this means knowing how to prioritise and it means alleviating the founders and management of a startup from issues which are not absolutely urgent. It means having the self-awareness of knowing that people have different agendas and knowing when to approach yours is essential.

Express thoughts preciselyDavid S. RoseIn modern enterprises, we have various ways to communicate. Writing is actually the basis of expressing ideas. I start training my employees who can't express well from improving writing abilities.It takes the time to train someone expressing thoughts really well via email or instant messages, but it's worth doing since it will ridiculously reduce the communication cost of your company.Besides writing, what I really want to point out is public speaking. The ability of pitching someone is not only used for investors. For developers, product managers, designers and especially marketing guys, they need to practise how to pitch multiple target audience at the same time.2. Use of resourceGood business brings numerous resources for company. It's a state of art for CEO and department managers to allocate resource to employees. How employees see and use resource decided the power and revenue this company can generate.There are three kind of important resource:One cannot wait for his leader to tell them how to deal with resource he was allocated. It makes a huge difference between those who wait orders and who take resource seriously.Effective practices and methodologies of using limited resource are really underrated skills for most employees don't have.3. Understand and solve problems never met before fastFor traditional education system around the world, especially in China, we don't teach children and students the way to explore unknown fields too much. People are trained to solve the problems which have already been taken care of decades or even centuries ago.Some talents I hired in my company are lucky enough to be aware of they should teach themselves how to think differently and challenge themselves with difficult issues all the time, some are not.From the perspective of a CEO, I will definitely the value former way more than latter, give them more space and resource to improve them.As time passed by, one with profound knowledge building skills will bring himself priceless experience, which leads to the ability to understand and solve problems never met before really fast.ConclusionThere can be a list to show what are underrated skills most employees don't have, above are three very fundamental.
