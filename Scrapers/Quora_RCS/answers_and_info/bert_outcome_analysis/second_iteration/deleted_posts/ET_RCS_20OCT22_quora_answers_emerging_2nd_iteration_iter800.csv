I mean, they rarely even use automatic targeting weapons, and there seems to be no sort of AI running anything, other than individual droid units who likely gain consciousness from some other non-programmed fashion.We do know that we can access their ships, since apparently firewalls don’t exist in this universe (a single R2 unit can easily gain access to an entire facility and hijack it).Now, let’s watch this play out.The ISD Intrepid drops out of hyperspace, approaching an undiscovered world on the borders of Imperial Space. Initial scans appear to show ridiculous agricultural potential if correctly harvested, something desperately needed to feed a vast galaxy. After relaying their findings to Admiral Reynolds, they are ordered to examine the planet, contact any dominant life forms and bring it under Imperial control.Further inspection reveals the planet has a notable population of humans, who were the sole dominant species on the planet. There is no sign of Hyperspace technology or sentient droids, but there is evidence of sophisticated communication technology. They send signals down to the planet, demanding to speak to the government. After dealing with several dozen individuals who claim to rule the planet (all of whom called it by different names, such as ‘Algeria’, ‘Slovakia’, ‘Peru’ and ‘New Zealand’) they eventually make contact with five individuals who claim to represent the World Security Council.The Imperials inform them that the Empire requires immediate membership, whereupon they will be assigned a temporary Imperial governor. They are told to hand over any primitive weaponry to the incoming Imperial Garrison. This is met with laughter from two of the Ambassadors (US and Russia) who claim that their nations would never surrender their sovereignty to an alien power.Realizing the locals need some persuading, the Admiral orders all 72 fighters to level the planet’s largest cities, while an Imperial Orbital Bombardment incinerates their planet’s capital (the most populated city, Shanghai).The TIEs move in to strike Istanbul first. This is met by 8 American F-22 Raptors and 18 American/Turkish F-16s. The TIEs begin their approach, but soon notice that dozens of missiles are approaching them from miles away. Those that can, dodge, but are blown to bits as the missiles track their movement. In the end, only three of the TIEs manage to escape, without even reaching their enemy.But the Star Destroyer is doing much better. As the ship approaches Shanghai, the Chinese government launches 16 nuclear warheads, with a total output of 2 megatons. While many of the missiles avoid the ineffective Imperial defensive batteries, the missiles are unable to pierce the shields, which can take nearly 200MT at a time. The ship then proceeds to lay waste to the city, though fortunately much of the population is able to be evacuated.The ship moves on. They learn of their crushing defeat by the surface ships, and decide to level Istanbul as vengeance. Rather than exit the atmosphere, they decide to fly slowly over the surface to strike fear into the local populace. The ship plans to wrap around North Africa and Europe before reaching Istanbul, all the while their ship is being ineffectively shot at.However, as the ship flies over the Red Sea to Sudan, the engines turn off. The ship’s computers are no longer responding to their command. The ship begins flying at much greater speeds, towards a landmass across the Atlantic. Onboard, an image in an unreadable language appears on all ship screensAdmiral Reynolds is furious. He cannot even leave the bridge as all rooms have gone into lockdown. The ship’s computers have been hijacked somehow. They do notice that lightspeed has been deactivated and gravity control hasn’t been touched. It seems that whoever is controlling the ship is avoiding activating any advanced tech.The ship descends calmly into a large clearing, a few kilometres away from a massive Pentagonal structure. They land in a grass and concrete field, with small ships dotting the sides of a loading bay. Outside, the Admiral sees hundreds of ground vehicles and people, armed with slugger rifles. A few of them begin entering the vehicle, bringing out a variety of surrendering troops or corpses, none of which happen to be their own.After a few moments, troops storm the bridge. The guards who raise their weapons are killed with ease, and the Admiral is forced to raise his arms in surrender.5 Years LaterThe Imperials were out for vengeance. They originally left the small backwater alone, but after word got out that such a primitive world defeated a decorated Imperial vessel, they had to send a message.The Moff stood on the bridge of the Super Star Destroyer Executor, while Vader was off on some mission in the Mid-Rim. With him were dozens of Star Destroyers, thousands of Advanced Fighters, and hundreds of smaller ships. This was one of the grandest fleets the Empire had ever assembled.The planet was to be razed, its people killed and enslaved. Had Project Stardust been completed they could have used that, but it was still a few years away from completion. Still, the planet would be uninhabitable in short order.Exiting Hyperspace, the fleet was curious. There were ships out and about, but they were mining asteroids, setting up settlements. They had almost no weapons. How did they destroy the …The ships shut down. Every single ship. The Interdictors, the frigates, even the SSD. All of them stopped working. They just defeated a large part of the galaxy’s army without firing a shot. The Moff didn’t know what just happened, but he soon would know: For Earth now had a fleet.",3 followers,Gary Jones,4K,460,4.9M,https://www.quora.com/If-an-Imperial-Star-Destroyer-attacked-Earth-how-would-we-defend-ourselves

This Star Destroyer is an epic sight, massive enough to be seen from Earth, just visible in space.Wonderment spreads through the streets. But before the awe begins to wear off, a massive tactical cannon drops downward. A green glow builds at the barrel…BOOM.The first laser (which is technically superheated gas) zips through the atmosphere. Much of its energy is lost, as all Star Wars lasers have a range, but it slams through a skyscraper, tearing through it and creating a burning explosion on the ground.The orbital guns don’t take long to start doing damage. People on the ground go into full panic and the US government organizes a unanimous response.Hundreds of nuclear warheads soar upwards. About half of them are shot down as the orbital guns target them, but the rest streak through the sky.And every one hits the shield, vaporizing in a flash of light that only does minor damage to the shields. Still, the damage becomes significant due to the sheer amount of nuclear weapons. And the onslaught isn’t over.In a matter of hours, as the Star Destroyer continues to rain laser bolts onto cities, a massive military force is organized. Having seen the lasers targeting the nukes, the countries organize to fire a massive volley, one they hope can’t be blocked.Over 9,000 nuclear warheads are launched in a concerted volley from every corner of the world. The amount of energy expended, and the lives lost as nukes are shot down from takeoff silos, is planetary.All along the side of the ship, nuclear weapons explode. The explosions are so widespread that even observers on Earth can easily see them. And across the Star Destroyer, the shields collapse. Nuclear weapons tear holes in the Durasteel that makes up the fleet and the Destroyer begins to descend towards Earth.The Destroyer undergoes a brutal crash landing that kills many of the crew. However, storm troopers exit the craft, guns blazing, and the fight begins on the ground.As seen in Episode Six, stormtroopers can be killed by blunt force or sharp objects to the neck, a tactic used by the Ewoks.So the US military opens fire with the largest guns they have. Military jets streak overhead in a preliminary strike, killing hundreds of stormtroopers and forcing them to take cover inside the fortified Durasteel hull of the burned out Destroyer.A single B2 Bomber races across the sky as the military jets and US ground soldiers take cover.And then a devastating explosion rips across the land, flattening the ground for miles in every direction and burning out most of the Durasteel hull. Another nuclear weapon has been dropped.But many of the stormtroopers are safe inside their Durasteel fortress. The outside of the craft, and the wiring within it, quickly melts. But the interior is fortified.The US government can’t nuke the stormtroopers into oblivion while they’re safe inside, and many of the savvier leaders realize how powerful this technology could be.By structural analysis (taken from a satellite) the generals conclude that forces still await inside the irradiated wreck, safe for the moment.So a massive blockade is formed around the downed spaceship, and the military waits to starve out the soldiers.The plan is effective. After several weeks, rations run low in the stormtrooper fortress and they move out. A battle forms between the storm troopers and the US forces. With heavy artillery and thousands of land mines, the US preparations prove superior.Across the globe, similar battles occur as stormtroopers exit the pods. Many are killed by lucky small arms fire that hits a weak spot, just as the arrows fired by the Ewoks did. Others are wounded.The Durasteel wreck of the ship remains a monument to the technological prowess of Earth, and preparations are immediately underway to identify the technology in use.Much of it is nearly indecipherable or destroyed, but a new arms race forms as each country realizes the value of the technology.Fifty years later, a US-made Star Destroyer fleet streaks into the galaxy at lightspeed, ready to return fire.",8 followers,Enoch Bobston,568,0,0,https://www.quora.com/If-an-Imperial-Star-Destroyer-attacked-Earth-how-would-we-defend-ourselves

Then fighters. Then ground troops. We will utterly pacify them and return the territory to the southern neighbors. Then we will claim we detected nuclear weapons being prepared. Then we address the UN, claiming that Earth is likely an ancient republic colony that was lost 20,000 years ago and that the Empire would like them to rejoin and take their place in the stars. However, due to our fragmented society, they understand if not all members wish to join. That’s fine. What ever country swears loyalty to the Empire first will be recognized as the legitimate planetary government of earth until such time as the Empire can appoint supervisors. Said country will get imperial weapons, technology, medical advances, and access to imperial resources. Those that do not wear loyalty to the Empire will… not.What’s that? They don’t trust the Empire? Here! We’ll tell you all about the corrupt and bloated Republic that fed off of human sweat and toil and proved disloyal in the end. About the terrorist organizations that would happily kill those that don’t embrace the Jedi religion. About these horrible, ugly Hutts that would happily sell all of Earth into slavery if it wasn’t for the strength and laws of the Empire. And we’ll trot up some aliens who will also tell you how important the Empire is (they better, or I’ll glass a few million of their kind. Eventually, statistically, I’ll get someone they care about!) But hey! If no country on Earth wants to swear loyalty to the Empire, that’s fine. They’ll go. Good luck with the Hutts and Mandalorians.Tell me you think America, China, or Russia wouldn’t be first in line. I dare you.In any case. Once I have the support of one of these superpowers, we start building up their infrastructure and augmenting their weapons with imperial ones. Maybe the have some good ideas for improvements. We can use earth as a test bed for imperial weapons technology. Eventually countries that refuse to join will be annexed or consumed by the loyalist nation. Armies will be trained with Imperial techniques and weapons, and when the last defiant country falls, those armies will be repositioned elsewhere in the galaxy.And the prize? Earth is renamed America, Russia, or China. We make it clear that for 20 years of service, you can see the galaxy for free. Heck, we’ll help the winner establish orbital industries too.

These things had much thicker armor, and their only weak spot was the neck, which wasn’t very long at all. Tripping it wouldn’t work either, unless you wrapped its legs up completely like in the movie, The Empire Strikes back.Another thing to consider is, imagine them appearing over Earth. They’re totally cut off from supply lines and have no way of getting new food. You might think they would be worried and launch a ground attack. You’d be wrong though.Each Star Destroyer carried several years worth of food supplies all safely sealed and stored. They could bombard us into oblivion and then wait for the world to be ready to grow food again.I hate to say it, but the odds are mostly in their favor.

Does that count as an application of my theory? You might be tempted to say ‘yes.’ What if the particular corollary doesn’t really use anything substantive about my theory and you could have deduced it in much simpler ways? You might now be tempted to say ‘no.’ What if the only reason why anyone would think to consider this corollary was in the context of my theory? You might have been convinced to say ‘yes’ again.Why is this relevant to category theory? Well, it is very easy to find examples of real-life problems that have a categorical structure—I’ll show some later, together with lots of citations. Do these then count as applications of category theory? I think that the answer is undoubtedly ‘yes’ if you use some theorem in category theory (which you would probably not have come up with otherwise) to show that something is true for such examples. But I also think the answer might be ‘yes’ even without satisfying that requirement.Let me give an example. I do a fair amount of my programming in SageMathThis might sound like it is just inheritanceBut Sage actually goes a little farther than just this—it isn’tYou need to learn a little bit to be able to make proper use of this framework but, when you do, it makes life a heck of a lot more pleasant. Thus, I think that introducing category theory is completely worthwhile here, and even if we aren’t really using any theorems about category theory, this should still be counted as an application. One could write a lot about why this frame of mind is a good approach to a lot of programming, even if you aren’t primarily interested in mathematics, as I am. I won’t go into this, but I will note that there are now textbooks on category theory written specifically with computer scientists in mindWith this giant aside out of the way, the first question that I want to answer is: why should we expect category theory to show up anywhere in real-world situations? This will have the surprising answer that we should expect it to show just aboutDefinition:If we have morphismsThis might seem like a very abstract and maybe even arbitrary definition, but it is a lot easier to digest with some diagrams. You can think of objects as being nodes and morphisms as being labeled arrows connecting them.The composition law then makes perfect sense—you can compose two arrows if the endpoint of one lines up with the starting point of another.Why is this compositionThe identity morphisms are kind of “do nothing” arrows—you can tack them on to the beginnings and ends of arrows without changing them in any way. When drawing category theoretical diagrams, it isn’t uncommon to leave them off entirely; they are, however, still useful to be able to define all sorts of things such as inverse morphisms.There are countless examples of categories that naturally pop up in mathematics, such as:However, you can just create a category “from scratch” so to speak by just drawing nodes and labeled arrows between them, as long as you make sure that the arrows follow the rules laid out in the definition of a category. This is significant because these kinds of arrow diagrams actually show up in lots of applied settings. Let’s be entirely concrete and consider the following diagram.This is a simplified chemical diagram. The nodes are possible collections of molecules in our system, and they are connected by arrows if there is a chemical reaction that will take us from one state to the other. There are essentially just two kinds of chemical reactions here: the first is the breakdown of the simple sugarYou might be able to guess that this can be generalized a fair bit. In some sense, whenever you come up against some kind of flowchart, you can try to interpret it as a category. This connects you not just to chemical processes, but to models of computation in computer science, business process modeling, Feynmann diagrams in physicsThis is part of a category constructed out of the flowchart associated to baking. (There are some things I am not telling you here because to understand this as a category you really need to understand how to tensor arrows together—more on this in a bit.) But the thing is that if we have any further diagrams where one of the steps is to prepare a lemon pie,we can just paste in the diagram up above into the red box if we need to actually understand how to do it in detail. Or, we could equivalently leave it off if we don’t want to worry about it, because it will be handled by some other party, for instance. That both of these approaches will give valid diagrams is assured by the fact that these are categories and so composition of morphisms is associative.We use this kind of black boxing in our real lives all the time without even thinking about it, but it is not altogether a trivial concept. It has to be drilled into young programmers that all of their code should ideally follow this paradigm where individual steps are handled as their own functions which can be called and edited separately from everything else. There are many reasons why this is important, including that:However, I am really just telling you part of the story, because categories are notHere are two examples of simple chemical reactions. The top is the reaction of hydrazinium with hydroxide, which produces hydrazine and water; the bottom is the reaction of methane with oxygen, which produces carbon dioxide and water. While these are two separate chemical reactions, there is an obvious way in which we ought to be able to combine them together—simply combine the starting and ending states for both.This makes a difference, because there are new chemical reactions that can happen with this new mix that could not have happened with the two separate states.The problem is, in a base category, there is no way to combine objects and morphisms in the way that we just did. Thankfully, there is a solution in category theory to this problem: introduce monoidal categories(Rough) Definition:This isn’t a precise definition in that I haven’t explained what the heck is meant byHere’s a basic example: real vector spaces form a category with linear transformations as the morphisms. This can be turned into a monoidal category by introducing the tensor productA less abstract example: in the chemical composition networks that we have studied, we can think ofIn this way, monoidal categories have tremendous descriptive power. There is, for example, a very well-cited paper by Baez and PollardIs this now an application of category theory? Arguably no, not yet: we’ve shown that categories (and partially monoidal categories) describe a vast array of different applied systems, but we haven’t shown that you can actually get any use out of this. Here, I think it is worthwhile to take a look at the papers citing Baez and Pollard’s aforementioned paperTo start getting at an answer, we need to introduce one final category-theoretical construction.Definition:It is very easy to give trivial examples of functors. For example, given the category of groupsIt’s much harder to give examples of functors that are particularly interesting, but when you do, it usually yields something extremely illuminating. Hatcher, in his bookWhy are functors interesting? One possible answer is that functors allow you to translate results (which can be phrased in category-theoretical language) about one category to results about another category. After all, since functors preserve compositionAnother possible answer is that we can sometimes think of a functor as a kind of evaluation or interpretation. For instance, there is a functor that takes topological spaces (if this is too abstract for you, picture, say, surfaces) and matches them to groups. One might think about the functor as evaluating the topological space to this particular group. One way to use this is by noting that if the groups don’t match, the topological spaces must be different. But there is more that you can pull out due to the fact that when we “evaluate” like this, we get morphisms (relations) between the evaluations, which is not something that you get when you evaluate a function on a set. And that extra information tells you about how everything has to fit together.In applied category theory, this is sometimes summarized as saying that the categoryand match it to the dynamical system representing how our molecules will react with each other over time. One huge benefit of this is that, due to the fact that this is a category, if we can understand very simple chemical reaction networks and the dynamical systems they represent, then we can understand very complicated chemical reaction networks by just breaking them down into smaller pieces and using compositionality.Another example is in natural language processing. There is a category of phrases (in, say, the English language) such that you only connect them by morphisms if this is grammatically correct (so, for instance, you can connect an arrow between a noun and a verb, but not a noun and a noun)—this is the syntax category. You can construct a functor from this category to some other kind of category that ``evaluates” the meanings of these phrases (that is, if two phrases are close in meaning, the corresponding objects in the category should be “close together” in some sense), which is the semantics category. This is, for example, what Kartsaklis, Sadrzadeh, Pulman, and Coecke did in their paperAre these examples of applications of category theory or not? I have seen some pooh-pooh such examples as needless abstraction. But as we discussed in the beginning of this post, sometimes just having an organizational framework can be hugely beneficial, even if you don’t get any deeper results—and one thing that category theory absolutely excels at is providing organization frameworks.Moreover, I think that, in at least some of these areas, there are going to be far more instances of category theory being used in non-trivial ways. In part, I say this because applied category theory is a very young field—the only journal that I know of that is devoted to it,Let’s say that you write some code in your favorite programming language and then you want to execute it. The computer has to turn your code into machine code—actual instructions that a CPU can perform. It does this by way of special software called a compiler which takes your code as an input and outputs machine code that performs the functions that the code describes. However, often we want a compiler to do more than just this: we want it to produce the most efficient machine code that it can which will perform the functions that code describes. In other words, we want an optimizing compilerThere is an inherent danger to an optimizing compiler though: you want it to tinker with the original code as specified by the programmer, but you emphatically do not want it to change what that code does—if that ever happens, then the programmer will get odd behavior that they will have extreme difficultly debugging (since the problem is not withHere’s one possible technique to do this (which I originally learned from an undergraduate thesis, of all things). If your language is designed like a category, then there are sorts of theorems you automatically have about its objects. Category theory can be terrific at proving, for instance, that you can take various constructions and permute the order in which you do them without changing the result. (I have a whole bunch of examples in this postTo be fair, I have yet to see anything but very basic theorems proved this way, but I don’t think that this should dissuade us much: as we already discussed, in applied category theory, it is often enough to understand the simple things and use compositionality to bootstrap to more complicated things.",2 followers,Nikhil Patel,3K,237,7.9M,https://www.quora.com/If-an-Imperial-Star-Destroyer-attacked-Earth-how-would-we-defend-ourselves

I agree. They do have plenty of room for normal purposes. However, putting a plexiglass divider between the front and back seats completely disrupts the very efficient use of space which Chevrolet designed to get a full-size “feel” out of a mid-size car. The Impala is also narrow - much narrower than a real full-size car like the old Crown Vic. Mount a computer and a stack of radios in the front, and the car becomes very cramped, very quickly.So, cops are going to SUVs for the same reason that the rest of America has gone to them. Government efficiency mandates for cars make it impossible to build a large car which falls in line with the requirements. Trucks and SUVs go by different standards, though, so the automakers make more SUVs.It’s not like most cops are even driving real SUVs though - the ones with truck frames. Some do, but more commonly cops are driving “crossover SUVs” which are really just shortened minivans. They are built on car frames, just like minivans. They just lack the 3rd row and the sliding door. Calling them SUVs is more of a style choice than anything having to do with the offroad capabilities of the vehicle.Look for more departments starting to drive pickup trucks, too. The super cab Ford trucks are extremely inexpensive for the police packages at state bid prices. They have more interior space than any regular car or “crossover SUV” on the market (especially head room for tall officers). They come with true 4-wheel drive and off road capability, which is great for cops who live in climates with lots of snow in the winter. They are built like trucks, which means they’re much less likely than cars (including crossover SUVs) to break when you hit potholes at 100mph and generally drive them roughly. They hold their value much better than a car, so when they’re sold, the department gets more money back than they would get for a used up Impala. These newer trucks get great gas mileage too - much better than cars of just a few years ago. My extremely tight wad Sheriff even acknowledged that pickup trucks are the best deal out there, financially, for new squad cars, and he is using them to replace our fleet of Impalas as they wear out.",3 followers,Stephen Sanford,2.5K,345,16.5M,https://www.quora.com/If-an-Imperial-Star-Destroyer-attacked-Earth-how-would-we-defend-ourselves

(Have you ever been locked in patrol car with an activated can of pepper spray??)Then I heard the alert tone of an officer in danger activate over my radio. I couldn’t see the stop, as dick head was over a hill and out of my view. I pulled out my flashlight and waved down the first pair of headlights I saw coming. It was a truck driver. I yelled “Take me down the road, my partner's in trouble” Dispatch had been screaming at him over the radio, but he wasn’t answering. Man, that truck driver put his best into it, and a mile or so later later, I jumped down, (I hung on the outside of the truck for the ride, cause I’m awesome…) and ran to help the dick head.

He had accidentally hit the emergency button, and had the volume all the way down on his radio. (because he’s a tool). I canceled the scores of police cars from all across the county burning up tires to help us. I waved the truck driver off, and kicked dickhead out of the driver's seat.

The police cited the driver for exceeding the weight restriction without having a permit issued by the Department of Transportation, and impounded the truck and tank. The army counsel had no luck getting the police to release either so they contacted our office to represent the driver in court on the citation and to litigate getting the vehicles back.I figured there was no way the state had the authority to enforce a rule of the road against the Army, just as the state has no authority to insist that Post Office vehicles have license plates. So I called the Department of Transportation’s chief counsel, figuring they’d intervene quickly. I was wrong. They insisted they had the right to enforce the permit requirement and impound the tank until the citation was resolved. No amount of screaming on my part made them budge and I ended the conversation telling them they better have the keys to the truck and my freaking tank back to the Army within the hour.I should have done some research before I popped off. Turns out, there was an Army regulation requiring vehicles to obey local traffic laws, including weight restrictions, and authorizing states to enforce their laws against personnel who violated them. The regulation contained exceptions for emergency situations and national security but for the most part, gave the local cop the right to stop the truck and cite the driver. You learn something every dayWe ended up in court but worked out an agreement with the Department of Transportation and the local police to have the vehicles released with a promise that the government would pay the fine.

That’s not the Sun—it’s 11 pm.Starfish Prime was part of Operation Fishbowl, a series of high-altitude nuclear tests in 1962. The US had previously done several tests involving nuclear weapons detonated about 50 miles above the Earth, but these tests had been performed hastily. They had demonstrated a lot of curious effects—for instance, people at a corresponding spot on the opposite side of the equator would instantly see huge, vivid auroras—but they hadn’t done a good job of capturing the effects with instruments and they hadn’t experimented with different altitudes. Some of the shots had also used very small nuclear weapons. And perhaps most importantly, they had noticed that the electromagnetic pulses that interfered with radios were different in these high-altitude detonations, but they needed more data to understand them.So the military decided to perform a series of more carefully-designed, better-instrumented experiments with larger weapons at different altitudes. Well,The original Fishbowl plan was to perform three tests:The planners anticipated that some of the test attempts would fail, so they decided that the first shot would have the codename, the second would have the codename followed by “Prime”, the third would use “Double Prime”, and so on.The military did their building and planning and, only six months behind schedule, they had a Thor rocket and a nuclear warhead on the launch pad for test shot Bluegill. They ignited the rocket just after midnight, started watching it ascend, and…it vanished. The rocket was still flying, but it had disappeared from their radar tracking screens. Although its trajectory had been correct, there was no way to know if it was off course and going to fly into some of the many ships and aircraft full of instruments to monitor the test, so the range safety officer sent it a self-destruct command.Undaunted, the military moved on to Starfish. They rolled out another rocket two weeks later, strapped a W-49 warhead to it, and ignited it. The rocket flew perfectly for 59 seconds, then the engine stopped, the rocket began to break apart, and the range safety officer sent it a self-destruct command. The rocket exploded about six miles aboveground, spreading charred pieces of rocket—some of them radioactive—across Johnston Island and the surrounding ocean.Still not getting the hint, the military moved on to Starfish Prime. Three weeks after the first Starfish, they brought out another rocket and W-49 and, in the middle of the night, lit the fuse. This time the rocket performed perfectly, arcing 375 miles above the Earth, then descending to 250 miles before detonating its 1.4 megaton warhead.The immediate effect was aThe detonation also quickly created intense auroras, illuminating thousands of miles of ocean from the test site to the Samoan Islands. But the most serious effect was that it created a dangerous radiation belt around the Earth which persisted for months after the test. Satellites passing through the belt were seriously damaged; two Navy navigation satellites, three research satellites from the US, UK, and USSR, and the first communications satellite to transmit live TV across an ocean were all lost to it.The military took one look at test shot Urraca, which was planned to detonate at an altitude with many more satellites, and said “nope”. But they kept trying with Bluegill, and Bluegill Prime succeeded in exploding on the launch pad, destroying the facility and once again spreading radioactive debris across the island.While the military spent three months cleaning up the mess, they re-planned Fishbowl, downsizing Bluegill’s warhead and adding three relatively small-yield, relatively low-altitude tests to achieve a more manageable electromagnetic pulse. Bluegill Double Prime once again managed to shower Johnston Island with debris, but BluegillThe Soviets ran their own series of high-altitude tests, this time over Kazakhstan; one of their tests produced a similarly gigantic EMP, which fried about a thousand miles of telephone and power lines and caused a fire that burned down a power plant. Around this time, the US and Soviet Union finally realized that aboveground nuclear tests were aSo, the answer to your question is: A nuclear bomb detonated in space doesn’t create a shock wave; instead, it creates a ton of radiation and some high-speed, particle-scale radioactive debris. There is no mushroom cloud—the blast is spherical and continues to visibly glow for many minutes.If the detonation is near a planet with a magnetic field and atmosphere, it interacts with them to create auroras, radiation belts that cook satellites for months, and a huge electromagnetic pulse that would probably fry a nation’s electrical grid and everything attached to it.
