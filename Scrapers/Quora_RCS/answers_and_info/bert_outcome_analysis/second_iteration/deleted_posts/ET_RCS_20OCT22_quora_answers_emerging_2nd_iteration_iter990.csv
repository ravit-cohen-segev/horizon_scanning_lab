A super computer is not necessarily faster at performing a calculation, however, it can perform a multitude of those calculations simultaneously. To achieve this type of performance, an individual problem must be broken down into many little tasks. The smaller the tasks, the more can be done simultaneously. So, apart from the computer language, and the OS, the only limit to string length is the available memory. On a super computer, this depends on what resources have been allocated to a specific task and is probably much lower than you might think. On the flip side, individual CPUs in a super computer could potentially have large amounts of RAM and that would be its maximum limit. You would probably have more contiguous RAM in a tricked-out gaming computer.One last thought; a text file is basically just a string stored in the file system. So, the maximum file size might be another limit.",5 followers,Matthew Lai,3K,3.9K,13.2M,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-maximum-length-of-characters-a-super-computer-can-possibly-handle-in-1-string

That’s actually the main point I will make when talking about how much ‘natural talent’ CR7 had, because there’s absolutely no chance his level of spatial intelligence was developed from scratch. What am I curious about is exactly how much of it is natural and how much is developed or trained, and whether he just realized his extraordinary gift and learned how to use it or he actually improved his spatial intelligence through any sort of training.As for the second part, let me explain the ‘mystery’ this way :On one hand, with how incredibly consistent he is with it, with how adaptive it is to surroundings (position and motion of the ball and the players, the available and created spaces… etc), and how effective it is at breaking and fooling even elite defenses and defenders, Ronaldo’s movement off-the-ball definitely looks like a product of impeccable calculation, the work of a genius.On the other hand, with how automatic it is (with respect to changes and such) and how he seems to have literally zero reaction/processing time with it, Ronaldo’s movement looks like an instinctive thing, basically a reflex for him (This apparently-contradictory combination is the scariest part of Ronaldo’s game. It’s the main reason why he’s a nightmare for any defense).What I would like to know is what it is like from Ronaldo’s POV : Does he feel like he actively processes things around him, but does it incredibly quickly ? Or does he feel as if there’s some sort of super computer in his brain that automatically processes everything for him in no time and forces his body to make the optimal move without Ronaldo consciously thinking about it (Tricky to express the idea, but I hope I did it will).All the other questions that would be interesting were probably already asked in past interviews.Follow my football Twitter account :",3 followers,Roger Maduro,1.4K,592,5.3M,https://www.quora.com/If-you-were-invited-to-a-private-meal-with-Cristiano-Ronaldo-what-would-you-talk-about-and-what-questions-would-you-ask-him

In addition to receiving ambient heat, spacecraft generate heat through many means, such as the operation of rocket engines, operation of electronics, or just the body heat of the crew members. Therefore, it needs radiators to dissipate excess heat and keep the temperature within acceptable levels. Let’s take a look at the ISS; these radiators are mounted outboard:If these radiators (or thermal management system) malfunction, the consequences can be devastating. The internal temperature can rise to a level that is dangerous to the occupant and/or damage equipment inside.But when you look at sci-fi spaceships, almost nobody talked about this aspect. Even if they do, it’s usually treated as an afterthought rather than a major driver to spacecraft design or part of the story. Instead of going through fancy battles, perhaps all you need to do to force an enemy spacecraft to surrender is to heat them up. Instead of getting lost in space, you could very well end up being roasted alive on the way.One major film that touched this is Avatar:Those big, glowing red thing in the back is the thermal management system, heated up so hot after a multi-year interstellar journey.",UNKNOWN,Shady,2.1K,1.3K,2.5M,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-most-interesting-concepts-in-science-fiction
