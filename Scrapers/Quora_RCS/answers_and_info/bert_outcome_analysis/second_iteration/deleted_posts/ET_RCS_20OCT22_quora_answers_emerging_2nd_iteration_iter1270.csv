His academic advisor happened to stumble upon this resume and became very angry.  He spoke to the student to find out what he'd used this false resume for, and compelled the student to cancel various applications for grad schools and jobs, or risk major disciplinary action.",34 followers,Rahul Chauhan,7.4K,2.5K,101M,https://www.quora.com/What-instances-have-there-been-when-someones-social-media-profile-cost-them-acceptance-into-college
1,"Thanks for the A2A.Thanks for the A2A.Most schools in the US, however,  are not all that selective. The selective schools get the most press, but the number of them is small. What many schools are looking for are reasonably good students, and reasonably good students who can pay. Many schools in the US import huge numbers of students from China. They have great transcripts, high scores, strong recommendations and essays. The problem is a lot of this is fabricated by paid ""agents"". They get paid a lot to write essays, and recs, alter transcripts etc. Many schools know this but often don’t put resources into checking these credentials. This leads me to believe that most schools, which need students, will not often deny a student based on a somewhat sketchy social media post or photo. If a student is reasonably good by the numbers is it worth cutting them out if they are holding what looks like an alcoholic beverage in a photo? I doubt it in most cases.I mention the alcohol photo as it too raises issues. A person looking like they are having a great time at a party might be holding a to go cup but it would be inviting a lawsuit to turn in that student. Even if they are holding a bottle of hard liquor that does not prove they actually consumed it. Would schools want to go to court over this? I doubt this too.Jack is the Director of Recruitment for Graduate Business Programs at Hofstra UniversityAlways enjoy your posts, Parke. I think you're right on the money. I do wonder, though, how many of those admission counselors who answered ""yes"" to that survey actively went out and took the time to find students' profiles. I can't imagine there's more than a handful of schools for which that is a normal part of their review process. As you say, there simply isn't time for it. We have a few ways admitted students can interact with each other through Facebook, but the conversation belongs to them. We've actually used Facebook for over six years, back before absolutely everything had its own Facebook page. Back then, students could interact with ""Admission Counselor""- a profile we set up to have a social media presence, way back in the day. If a student had messaged me there or now if they engage through Facebook, it was and is incumbent on them to carefully manage their privacy settings, IF they have anything they don't want visible to us and IF we clicked on their profile after they contacted us. That said, they are the ones who reach out to us. If they don't, we're not taking the time to find them on Facebook. My long-winded point is: for us, Facebook functions much like the interview. It is not required, but when a student goes out of their way to engage with us and start a conversation on social media, as in any other method of communication, we appreciate their engagement and welcome their comments or questions. Of those survey-takers who answered yes, I wonder how many actively sought out students on Facebook and for how many the students had already opened that line of communication with them.","358,197 followers",Sean Kernan,860,5.6K,723.6M,https://www.quora.com/What-instances-have-there-been-when-someones-social-media-profile-cost-them-acceptance-into-college

Continue your studies :-> Here you have several options:a) Pursue Masters's from IIT by cracking IITJAM or from any other university on Physics and earn a Ph.D. later on. You can also do an Integrated Ph.D. by applying and getting a good rank in JEST, TIFR, IISER, etc.b) Pursue your Masters from any IIT (or from any other University) and then pursue MTech by cracking GATE. After MTech, you can get placed in some PSUs or some reputed MNCs. Many prefer higher studies though (like Ph.D. after Mtech). (P.S - IIT Kharagpur provides Integrated Mtech-PhD for Computer Science and Data Analytics after qualifying in GATE)c) Give an entrance test conducted by a few universities for Btech and get into some good Engineering Colleges. (Ex: Jadavpur University in Kolkata conducts an entrance test for students of BSc(Hons) Physics. Qualified Candidates enter into 2nd year of BTech. Likewise, Calcutta University provides Btech in Radiophysics.)d) Do Bachelors in Education(BEd) for a Teaching Job.e) MSc in other subjects like Biophysics, RadioPhysics, Geophysics, Instrumentation, etc. Ex - MScTech in Geophysics from ISM Dhanbad (Note: the degree mentions MScTech, not MTech; Both are different).f) Other Masters program in other disciplines if you want to do it like MCA, MBA, MA, LLB, etc. (Being interested in Defence Services, personally I would have preferred Masters from Institute of Defence Studies in Pune and Ph.D. later on— a path very few know or like to tread .)g) If you have a Gap in years after your BSc Physics and possess the thought that you will be unable to share the class with the younger generation, feel free to pursue distance learning through IGNOU. You can pursue your master's in other subjects via IGNOU or sit for an entrance examination for MSc. Physics (distance learning) which by the way IGNOU conducts in collaboration with the Indian Institute of Astrophysics (forms available in the month of September).h) You can also pursue higher studies from foreign universities. Of course, you have to crack the competitive exams related to that purpose.2. Get a Job :→ You can Apply for Various entrance examinations for Banks(RBI Grade B, SBI PO, IBPS, etc), Railways( ASM, Goods Guard, JE, RPF SI, etc), PSUs or State Units(AAI ATC, Electricity Executives, Forest Guard, etc), Armed Forces(AFCAT, CDSE, Coast Guard(only interview) ), Civil Services(UPSC CSE, State CSE, IFoS) and Central/State Police Services( SSC CAPF, UPSC CAPF, SSC CGL, etc). Crack these Examinations and earn a respectable service with the Central or State Governments or Banking Sector or PSUs.(PS: If you have completed MSc Physics then you can apply to the Indian Navy as an Officer or else not. Indian Navy does not recruit candidates having just BSc in Physics. You either should have BTech or do MSc Physics- the condition valid even in UPSC CDSE recruitment)→ If you want a job in your core field(subject), there are exams like ISRO Scientific Assistant, SSC IMD Scientific Assistant, BHAVINI Scientific Assistant, NCPOR Scientific Assistant(which do not conduct any exam but only Personal Interview), NPCIL Scientific Assistant, etc. which too are Govt Organisations that requires Bachelor’s in Physics as a qualification.(PS- If you complete MSc in Physics however you can apply for a relatively higher position in similar organizations for the post of Scientific Officer - Some institutes like BARC do not recruit candidates having a degree less than that of MSc.)You know the craze for Government Jobs, Don’t you? Some Jobs are indeed Earned. :)→ However, You can always find a Job in the Corporate Sector. Ex: TCS, WIPRO, etc.So, All the very Best if getting a Job is your sole Aim.P.S - Build and Develop Skills via sites(also Android App) like Udemy, Coursera, edX, Skillshare, Codecademy, Allison, etc. Trust me sometimes recruiters will be much interested if they learn that you have invested some quality time in having knowledge which can give you an edge over other candidates. Also makes your Resume look quite attractive. Moreover guess what, most courses are totally free of cost.

5,"At some point in my life, I considered an MIS. So here is my two cents on the matter:You have stated that you are in a business development role. Given this, why aren't you considering an MBA? An MIS degree may possibly land you an IT sales / BD job in the future in the US but it's more likely that you would land a business analyst or any other kind of ""IT Consultant"" role. And for now, I would presume you don't know if you may or may not like doing any of that.At some point in my life, I considered an MIS. So here is my two cents on the matter:You have stated that you are in a business development role. Given this, why aren't you considering an MBA? An MIS degree may possibly land you an IT sales / BD job in the future in the US but it's more likely that you would land a business analyst or any other kind of ""IT Consultant"" role. And for now, I would presume you don't know if you may or may not like doing any of that.If I were you I would consider doing the following:Continue to work for the next 2-3 years in your current role. If you like the company, continue with it. Try not to switch unless your current role or company are no longer bearable. Do not bother too much about the money. At your age, building skill sets and choosing something you'd like to do with the rest of your working life is paramount. When you do the same role for a year or more, you are more likely to know and understand if this is the thing you want to do for the next 10 or more years.After doing all this well, you should have a good business case for a Top 30 school in the US  for an MBA admit for the fall of 2018.Now, if there are other limiting factors like money (a US MBA should be at least $100,000 for a couple of years tuition - I may not be accurate with numbers, so double check this) then you may then try for an MIS after considerable research on whether you like it and if it still makes sense. I know that MIS is a lot cheaper.Once you get an admit, be sure to stay connected to your bosses at your current company and see if they could absorb you back in their US or overseas offices when you finish college. Always a good think to have job security.As to why I am harping on an MBA for an MIS question, here is why: From what I know, if you have the business case for an MBA for a top 30 school, the MIS at a very good university should be a lot easier. And you may even get partial or full funding in good schools (with UG grades, GMAT caveat). And the best part is that MIS degrees are offered by b-schools. You can still pick up sales oriented course work and continue your sales career. And you can network with the MBA grads. So it's all about aiming higher and upping your game.Hope this helps. All the best.","91,431 followers",Roland Bartetzko,673,3.4K,313.6M,https://www.quora.com/What-instances-have-there-been-when-someones-social-media-profile-cost-them-acceptance-into-college

Can you please provide an overview of the MFin Program at MIT Sloan?Created in direct response to the 2008 financial crisis, the MFin Program provides a comprehensive study of finance and its application to addressing financial and economic challenges facing our world today. This STEM designated program offered in both a 12 and 18 month format has a rigorous and flexible curriculum led by world-renowned faculty where you can explore complex issues impacting finance and engage with globally recognized industry leaders on important finance problems.Students who wish to further specialize there area of focus can choose a concentration in Financial Engineering, Capital Markets or Corporate Finance.** The STEM Classification is new and announced on June 2, 2016.2. Being able to pick the right program is crucial given the number of options available in the market. At ReachIvy, we meet a lot of students who face this decision. Who should ideally be applying for this program?MFin targets early-career professionals (0-4 years experience) who are interested in finance and have some prior exposure industry either through an internship(s), f/t experience, or research.3. What advice would you give students who are debating between the MBA and the MFin programs?MFin is for early-career professionals who are interested in a deep-dive into finance. The traditional MFin student has less experience than an MBA and will take nearly double the amount of finance classes in their respective programs. MFin students tend to be more quantitative which aligns well with the direction of the finance industry.4. Can you share with us what background / profile / traits you are looking for in your incoming class?We look for candidates with academic success including a solid foundation in math, excellent language and communication skills, professional presence, and global diversity.For more information regarding MFin and the class profile, please go to5. Can you tell us about your most interesting classes and professors?Modern finance was born at MIT Sloan by the pioneers who continue to teach in our program including Robert Merton, John Cox, and Andrew Lo, among other renowned faculty. Our curriculum includes a solid foundation in finance theory, financial markets, corporate finance and analytics of finance. Our extensive list of electives is ever evolving to meet student interest and industry needs, i.e. Entrepreneurial Finance & Venture Capital, FinTech, Behavioral Finance, and Financial Engineering. Action learning is a key component of the MFin experience and an opportunity for students to put theory into practice by partnering with industry leaders to solve real word problems.6. What are some of the facilities and faculty resources available to students who want to pursue research or entrepreneurial interests while in the program?MFin students may pursue research by undertaking an independent study, completing a thesis, or participating in research projects in our Center of Finance & Policy.MIT is known for innovation and entrepreneurship, MFin students have access to courses, labs, makerspaces, competitions, etc… to learn about entrepreneurship and pursue ideas.7. There is a lot of curiosity among our students on what a classic day would be like in the MFin Program at MIT Sloan. Could you describe it for us?MIT is a dynamic campus with unlimited opportunities – no one day is “typical”. That said, the classic day for an MFin is to attend class, participate in a group or club meeting over lunch, attend a company presentation or cultural event in the evening and end the day with studies/coursework.8. How does MIT Sloan assist current international students with career guidance and placement? For students looking to return to India – what type of support would they receive?All MFin students are eligible for Career Core (comprehensive programming in preparation of a job search), on-campus recruiting, job fairs, networking opportunities, an extensive list of job postings, and personalized career advising – all of this and more is offered by our MIT Sloan Career Development Office. MFin students seek opportunities all over the world and have access to career advisors, employer partners, and the MIT Alumni Network to help them be successful in their search.9. Is there any type of financial aid available to international students applying for this program? If so, can you tell us more about who the ideal candidate would be?We have a limited number of merit-based fellowships that are offered to applications admitted to our MFin program. Fellowships are awarded on the basis on academic success, personal achievements, and professional promise. Both international and domestic admits are considered for these fellowships.10. If you had one piece of advice to give to students interested in applying to this program, what would it be?Have a passion for Finance!Ms. Heidi V. Pickett is the Director of the MIT Sloan Master of Finance program with responsibility for developing and implementing new programing, engaging external stakeholders, and executing strategies supporting the mission of producing the next generation of global financial leaders. With over 20 years in financial services, Ms. Pickett has expertise in corporate development, business strategy, and global operations.

Initially, years of gymnastics competition showed me that flexibility was required to overcome the tendency to allow one mistake from negatively affecting the entire meet. By the time I was competing at YMCA Nationals, I had developed the mental flexibility to master this resiliency: I executed a 1st Place beam routine after a bars score below my standard.Over the years, I advanced my flexibility so that I could work in-depth with a number of personalities and demands from the academic, musical, social, and athletic worlds. I continue developing mental elasticity most by interacting with quartet members in rehearsal and performance. As first violinist, I lead our ability to work with inconsistencies that occur from performance to performance. For example, when the cellist takes more time with a ritard, I spontaneously mesh that rubato with the quartet’s tempo and the melody’s sound quality in the next phrase.My flexibility has also been invaluable academically. At Woods Hole camp, I was excited to wake for B Watch’s 4am marine sample collection and analysis because I was able to adopt the boat’s schedule quickly. Similarly, I rapidly and successfully transitioned to MNTL’s engineering community.

First, a deterministic lateral displacement array separates whole blood into white blood cells (WBCs) and red blood cells (RBCs). WBCs are flowed through either a CD4 or CD8 antigen-lined capture chamber, and electrodes count impedance pulses to give HIV/AIDs prognosis through CD4+/CD8+ T-cell enumeration. RBCs are lysed to release individual parasites, since whole, infected RBCs cannot be captured because parasite-derived proteins are either submembranous or vary the antigen expressed on the RBC surface. Individual parasites are then captured and detected via fluorescent labeling instead of impedance spectroscopy, since current impedance technologies cannot accurately differentiate the small parasites from RBC membrane remnants in the lysate.I have traveled internationally to [XXX list of countries].
