Production is may be one among ten divisions of an industry where Pharm Ds may not be needed. The numerous and diverse career options available to Pharm D students:1. Clinical ResearchClinical research is a branch of medical science that determines the safety and effectiveness of medications, devices, diagnostic products and treatment regimens intended for human use. These may be used for prevention, treatment, diagnosis or for relieving symptoms of a disease. The term clinical research refers to the entire bibliography of a drug/device/biologic, in fact any test article from its inception in the lab to its introduction to the consumer market and beyond. Once the promising candidate or the molecule is identified in the lab, it is subjected to pre-clinical studies or animal studies where different aspects of the test2. PharmacovigilancePharmacovigilance (abbreviated PV or PhV) is the pharmacological science relating to the detection, assessment, understanding and prevention of adverse effects, particularly long-term and short-term side effects of medicines. Generally speaking, pharmacovigilance is the science of collecting, monitoring, researching, assessing and evaluating information from healthcare providers and patients on the adverse effects of medications, biological products, herbalism and traditional medicines with a view to:3. Research & DevelopmentResearch & Development: The phrase research and development refers to the “creative work undertaken on a systematic basis in order to increase the stock of knowledge, including knowledge of man, culture and society, and the use of this stock of knowledge to devise new applications”.4. Medical WritingMedical Writing: Is the activity of producing scientific documentation by a specialized writer. The medical writer typically is not one of the scientists or doctors who performed the research. A medical writer, working with doctors, scientists, and other subject matter experts, creates documents that effectively and clearly describe research results, product use and other medical5. Product Managers:A product manager investigates, selects, and develops products for an organization, performing the activities of product management.6. Regulatory affairs:Regulatory Affairs (RA), also called Government Affairs, is a profession within regulated industries, such as pharmaceuticals and medical devices. Regulatory Affairs professionals usually have responsibility for the following general areas:8. Top level medical representatives9. Academics10. Community Pharmacy:A community pharmacy is a community-based pharmacy. The main responsibilities of a community pharmacy include appropriate procurement, storage, dispensing, and documentation of medicines.11.Geriatric Pharmacy:Geriatrics is a sub-specialty of internal medicine and family medicine12. Governmental agencies13. Home Health Care:Home Care, (also referred to as domiciliary care or social care), is health care or supportive care provided in the patient’s home by healthcare professionals (often referred to as home health care or formal care. Often, the term home health care is used to distinguish non-medical care or custodial care, which is care that is provided by persons who are not nurses, doctors, or other licensed medical personnel, as opposed to home health care that is provided by licensed personnel.14. Hospital Pharmacy:A hospital pharmacy is concerned with pharmacy service to all types of hospital and differs considerably from a community pharmacy. Some pharmacists in hospital pharmacies may have more complex clinical medication management issues whereas pharmacists in community pharmacies often have more complex business and customer relations issues. Because of the complexity of the medication use system, many pharmacists practicing in hospitals gain more education and training after pharmacy school through a pharmacy practice15. Managed Care:The term managed care is used in the United States to describe a variety of techniques intended to reduce the cost of providing health benefits and improve the quality of care (“managed care techniques”) for organizations that use those techniques or provide them as services to other organizations (“managed care organization” or “MCO”), or to describe systems of financing and delivering health care to enrollees organized around managed care techniques16. Pharmacoeconomics:Refers to the scientific discipline that compares the value of one pharmaceutical drug or drug therapy to another. It is a sub-discipline of Health economics. A pharmacoeconomic study evaluates the cost (expressed in monetary terms) and effects (expressed in terms of monetary value, efficacy or enhanced quality of life) of a pharmaceutical product. We can distinguish several types of pharmacoeconomic evaluation: cost-minimization analysis, cost-benefit analysis, cost-effectiveness analysis and cost-utility analysis. Pharmacoeconomic studies serve to guide optimal healthcare resource allocation, in a standardized and scientifically grounded manner. One important consideration in a pharmacoeconomic evaluation is to decide the perspective from which the analysis should be conducted (such as institutional or societal).Thank you!:)",280 followers,Deepthi Bathina,512,0,0,https://www.quora.com/What-am-I-supposed-to-do-after-completing-a-Pharm-D-from-India-What-are-the-areas-of-specialization
1,"There are plenty of excellent reasons for job candidates to extensively research the companies they hope will employ them, and plenty of risk in failing to do your homework.Before I go further, let me describeI almosThere are plenty of excellent reasons for job candidates to extensively research the companies they hope will employ them, and plenty of risk in failing to do your homework.Before I go further, let me describeI almost always ask candidates, “What do you know about what we do and who we do it for?”A solid 30% of candidates respond just like a 6th-grade student presenting a book report to their class they assembled the night before from Cliff’s Notes… down to the monotone or sing-song recitation.Bad, Bad, Bad!What you say when answering my questions is important... But many of us ask questions that aren’t evaluating whether your answer is correct or accurate. We evaluate how you construct an idea and if you provide perspective that advances a theme or is part of a narrative.I’m asking the question to get your perspective and hopefully an angle that reflects your analytical skills. It is disheartening to hear a candidate answer by reciting the second paragraph from Wikipedia’s entry for our business.This is the wrong way to answer:“JonCorp Solutions was founded in 1997 as GoofyLab Productions, employing a staff of 9 at its headquarters located in Minneapolis, MN. JonCorp was acquired by ComCom Communications in 1999, which was based in San Francisco. The combined revenue was {blah blah blah}…”It’s wrong because I dislike being driven crazy, and it’s terrible for you because it undermines my confidence that you’re professional or senior enough — both critical for whoever we hire.The WikiCheats answer tells me that I might not want you interacting with our clients, partners or leadership team — if this is how you prepared for a meeting with the guy deciding whether you get a job, I’m not confident that you’d be able or willing to do more (much more) when the question is coming from a VIP client.Our clients need to be confident that the people on my team are competent, engaged and worth the big bucks they pay to get what we offer. I need to be confident that you are able to think on your feet and offer insight — which doesn’t happen when you’re just unspooling assorted benchmarks and metrics without meaningful subtext.So that’s what not to do. What’s the right way to do it?Approach the interview like a higher-stakes version of that book report we were all assigned in elementary school… a book report where your career and livelihood are at stake.Most companies schedule interviews at least a week in advance; we like to do it a couple weeks beforehand, to accommodate any conflicts or rescheduling. That’s enough time, if you invest a couple hours or more each day, to:If you’re interviewing at Target Corp, you should know the basics (retail consumers, skew female, household median income).Then you need to be conversant in their key metrics (same-store customer retention, per-visit spend amount, differentiation from WalMart and their consumer segments, whether they sustain their strength in soft-line categories while focusing on expanding their grocery revenue).That’s a good start.Down in the mineshaft:…You get the picture.The other intel you should collect has several dimensions of value: get familiar with the organization chart and key people in tje comoany. Try to learn who’s running things and how they’re organized:Learning about the roles, structure and names of their leadership is great if you’re good with names and able to remember who runs what. It’s also a career map, showing how you’ll advance in stature by taking their jobs someday.Above from TheOrg websiteIF YOU MADE IT THIS FAR, YOU DESERVE A REWARD.Here’s a valuable tip for you, to show my appreciation for not dropping a TL;DR on me (yet):Why on Earth would you waste your time on this?I started doing this a while back when preparing for meetings with important clients or business trips to meet executives from a major vendor. A couple years ago, I had a meeting with a strategic partner in NYC where the whole group was all-honchos — their top people, our top people.I ran the names of people in the meeting and sources like the vendor’s org chart (easy to data-mine with ourOur vendor’s CEO was a board member for the charity, and this cause (providing clean water to people in impoverished regions of Africa) was all over the social profiles of their executive ranks.Right away, I joined WaterAidI wanted the membership cards, but I also realized we as a company didn’t do enough philanthropic work and this is one that makes a difference.A couple weeks later, we were at their offices in New York having a late lunch with the CEO and our vendor contact. When a waiter finished refilling his water glass, the CEO held it up and told us the effort it took the women in South Sudan to walk miles to obtain two containers of water, about 20 water glass worth.That’s what they had for two days to drink, cook and clean themselves and their family. Then they walked for miles again to get more water.The CEO mentioned WaterAid, and how it was an important cause that most of us don’t think about. This was perfect, because I wasn’t going to mention it unless the subject came up from the vendors… that would be crass and unseemly.So I told him the 100% unvarnished truth: I was doing my homework for our meeting, and WaterAid came up again and again in connection to the vendor’s leadership team.I told the CEO, “If you and your team weren’t as passionate as you are about WaterAid, I wouldn’t have known what it was.” I took the membership card out to show the table.“And when I joined as a corporate sponsor, I realized you guys are doing the charitable stuff that our company didn’t… my goal is to get our executives to match your executives in supporting the charity by the next meeting we have next Spring. Thank you.”The CEO and our vendor contact were visibly touched, and what I said about challenging them by matching their donationsThe CEO wrote me a letter after that explained how much it meant to them that we were inspired by them.Our executive team was more than happy to join the challenge, especially because we went into the meeting with a very uncomfortable, potentially disasterous issue to resolve with the vendor. The expectation was for us to just “keep the patient alive” so we didn’t lose the vendor.In his lovely note to me, the vendor CEO mentioned his hope for us to make a tradition each year of meeting and upping the wager on our teams’ charitable efforts, the relationship was repaired literally by accident and a slip of the tongue.CoolThe moral of this story is pretty clear:That’ll get you hired.",817 followers,Sumeet Raj Thakker,32.1K,0,0,https://www.quora.com/What-am-I-supposed-to-do-after-completing-a-Pharm-D-from-India-What-are-the-areas-of-specialization

I've seen a lot of talented friends get3. Why should we hire you?Once again, they won't ask you this, but helps you tell your story. With examples.One effective structure for an answer goes something like this: ""From what I understand about the company and role, it seems you are looking for someone with x, y, z.

Make sure they are interesting. People see past success as a huge indicator.5. How would you go about doing [thing you need to do]?Eg for a PM: tell me some product ideas? How would you change feature x?) (eg 2 for a Brand Marketer: ""how would you write a creative brief?"") (eg 3 for BD;: What's the most impactful BD we can do next year? How would you get it done?""5. Do you have any questions for me?If you haven't already, get the interviewers background. Have two or three insightful questions about the company, which demonstrate why you are passionate about the place. Then end with one of these ""what are you most proud of since you've started working here?"", ""where do you see this team/company in 5 years"", or the best: ""how would you describe the ideal candidate for this position?"" (if they remotely like you they will describe you.)The Night BeforeListen to 2-3 videos of the CEO talk about the company. You'll pick up verbiage unique to the company (for example- do they call the people who use their service users? Customers? Riders? Pinners?) which will make you seem like you speak their language. Subtle but powerful.How to Dress?Dress comfortable and when in doubt look at the executives on the about me page. Dress like that.Things to remember (before, after, and during the interview):- Write thank you notes. I know, I hate those too. Most people don't care, but 1/10 is offended.

They haven't had room to make mistakes or give themselves time to figure out what they really want, so the impulse to look for approval from following well-lit paths remains with them. Hence the channelling of so many of them to government, financial services, and consulting. There's much less of a 'go out and do it yourself' atmosphere here than at Stanford, for instance.As one professor noted during a discussion of Kantian ethics, Princeton is a very instrumentalized place; it's common to be treated as a means to an end rather than an end unto oneself. While this reaches its apogee around the bicker eating clubs, anything with competitive admission will generate metric tonnes of toolish behavior. This even/especially applies to the administration: art/theater projects are more likely to get funded if they will look good on the website, and there is a clear sense that decisions are pretty heavily affected by how they will look to the ratings people at US News & World Report. There are definitely a number of well-funded showpieces and programs that look great on paper but struggle to gain traction among the student body.Beyond that, there's a vague sense of discomfort with oneself that seems to be widespread and in fact encouraged. The culture on campus values the theoretical over the practical, the critical over the active, the verbal over the physical. People are rarely comfortable in their own skin, which contributes to the frequently-acknowledged awkwardness of dating, hookups, and relationships. [There's not a lot of space for pure intellectual inquiry or intellectual curiosity for its own sake, unless you're lucky with the group of friends you end up with. And you can be very lucky, to be fair: many of the most brilliant, interesting, passionate people I know, I met at Princeton.

I'll focus on just one.The most obvious downside for some people is a social one. It will become clearer in my answer for whom this downside was most strongly felt. First, a quick note about how you should read this answer. Realize that it's relaying a memory in its current state, which memory itself has as its basis an impression that's been digested multiplied times over many years. It's been about 9-15 years since I graduated (I don't want to be too specific). So, first of all, understand that the most salient features of an experience get amplified in one's memory. Additionally, memories are interpreted and reinterpreted over time. So, certain aspects are bound to be exaggerated. Other aspects are bound to be underemphasized or downplayed. Does this mean that these kinds of memories are not valuable or informative? I think they are as long as they are read with this understanding ...Diversity at Princeton has increased over the years, and it probably continues to increase, but all this meant when I was a student was that there were four distinct groups of people at Princeton, who were clearly delineated (or at least this is how things feature currently in my recollection). What follows will be obviously an oversimplification in terms of a breakdown, but do bear with me:First, there was the ""cool"" group - mostly white from relatively wealthy backgrounds (with the token minorities integrated in small numbers, who were usually wealthy, attractive, or both). This group was pretty much impenetrable for the average person who happened to be at Princeton (and by average, I mean average in most ways besides being a good student).(Above is Princeton's most notoriously elitist ""eating club"" - at least this is how it was perceived when I attended, by most students, including its own members)(Above is Princeton's most notoriously elitist ""eating club"" - at least this is how it was perceived when I attended, by most students, including its own members)The second group consisted mostly of ""outwardly intellectual"" people, who didn't care as much about being ""cool"", but they did care a lot about being intelligent and accomplished, and about showing it. So, they tended to be either very vocal/opinionated, or they made it clear that they liked to keep to themselves to some degree. They tended not to be very showy, but many of them were somewhat standoffish.The third group consisted mostly of white people who were a bit more friendly and down to earth ... They could intermingle with relative ease with most people in groups 1-4, maybe most easily with group 1 if they happened to have some ""cool capital"". ""Cool capital"" was multifaceted and each of its facets probably comprised a continuum or spectrum. So you could be on the threshold, not quiteThe fourth group was everyone else. It included nerds, engineering majors, minorities, international students, and some white folks who were just extra minority-friendly, etc. This fourth group didn't intermingle much at all with group 1. Group 1 was entirely separate from group 4. If you belonged to group 4, you could potentially go your entire four years without having so much as a single full conversation with anyone in group 1. That's precisely how it was for yours truly - never a single convo with anyone from group 1. I remember being introduced to people in group 1 a couple of times, andThe proof that it probably wasn't just me being hypersensitive is that, first of all, I only really noticed this when thinking back after I graduated. I really wasn't especially sensitive to this sort of thing at the time. When I was a student, I was too busy studying my ass off and living life to even care who was friendly and who was standoffish. I had my friends and that was that. Only upon retrospection did I even notice a common link between the people who were least friendly: they were most often in group 1. Additional proof that I wasn't just being hypersensitive is in the fact that I recall minorities and others complaining of this very thing when we were students and afterwards, and the funny thing is that, at the time, I tended to dismiss these complaints as my friends ""just being negative"", mainly because I enjoyed the overall experience so much that none of this bothered me at the time ...But group 1 was in fact so separate, even as large as it was, that it somehow managed (intentionally or organically) to all but completely avoid coming across, or even needing to interact with, people in group 4 ... Even those aforementioned brief introductions were indeed very few because there were so few mutual connections in the first place to engender such an intro.What made Princeton (and I'm certain other similar schools) different from anywhere else was that group 1 was rather large - pretty huge actually. You could have a very healthy social life without interacting with group 1, because there were plenty of other people to interact with. In fact, the majority of students didn't explicitly belong to group 1, but group 1 was large enough that you were constantly reminded you'reThe funny thing is that, as I mentioned, I didn't really think much of it at the time.. It was what it was, and it didn't feature heavily (or almost at all) in my daily concerns. I was aware of it, but dismissed it just as soon as it came to mind -  I almost expected and accepted it by instinct. I suppose one thing that helped me do so was that I arrived in the U.S. as an immigrant in elementary school, and had encountered outright hostility at that time. This decreased through high school, and was almost entirely non-existent in college. So, actually, my reference frame was likely different from that of someone who was born and raised in the U.S. and my expectations were also different. College was much better than high school and if Princeton's culture or social dynamic was really unusual and peculiar for an American university, well, I didn't know any differently. It was much much easier to make friends in college than it was for me in high school, and the existence of a group that was so separate and exclusive was just a non-issue for me in the grand scheme. As I wrote, I was too busy living life to be embittered this dynamic. I kinda just brushed those people off as superficial and inconsequential to my life.However, looking back, it bothers me now, mainly just to know that this existed and likely still does. It's definitely a troubling dynamic even when it doesn't affect you personally, if you just sit and examine it. In a way it's part of how the world works, part of this fallen humanity, but in a way, it's also just wrong. It's especially noticeable now that I see how the same people continue to have special privileges after graduation whereas a lot of us work our butts off and we don't experience nearly a fraction of the perks they do. Group 1 people seem to have had all along some kind of ""cheat code"" to life (to varying degrees of course), and not all due to their parents' wealth, but a variety of other factors ... And coming across them or their ilk in the real world is a frustrating reminder of this, that life isn't really a meritocracy, and that there are people who are not fundamentally more valuable than you, and yet somehow life places them ""higher"" and you experience rejection on their account ...I suppose that, in light of this, another reason that made it easy to ignore the aggregate social dynamic at Princeton was that Princeton itself, once you were inside, functioned more or less as a meritocracy (the institution itself did). So, concerning what mattered, what we were all there for in the first place, we were in a sense on equal footing, but only for a time. It's easier to find fairness when evaluations are based on exams and papers, and not as much on ""whom you know"", your social capital, your sexual capital, etc.The privilege that group 1 enjoys only affects matters of real-life consequenceI suppose that this normalizing factor of being part of a meritocratic institution for those four years is what engenders these social institutions on campus. The ""social elite"" are now on equal footing in the eyes of the institution (even if they had a much easier time getting into the institution). So, the only way to distinguish themselves based on non-academic or performance-related metrics, would be via constructed social practices that build directly on those institutions within the university that embody and encapsulate its history of elitism (like the Eating Clubs). This is not to say that group 1 didn't also boast strong performance-related metrics. It probably was indistinguishable in this regard (though I don't have actual statistics), but performance-based metrics weren't enough of a distinction.Another way to put it is this. Princeton used to be for the social elite. Now, it has opened its doors to more people of varying backgrounds, and yet the social elite continue to comprise a substantial segment of its student body. This segment must continue to feel that they are ""at Princeton"", and this must mean something to them that is more encompassing than mere confirmation that they are great students. Members of this segment enjoyed multifaceted distinction from their peers before Princeton. So, they tended to continue to seek this distinction during their years at Princeton and thereafter.So, although I am not personally acquainted with a caste system, Princeton's social structure (and almost certainly that of other schools like it) is the closest thing to a caste system here in America, where official social institutions exist to reinforce the classism (like Eating Clubs).To be fair, most students enjoy their time and wouldn't trade their ""Princeton experience"" for the world, but I know some of the few people who just hated going to Princeton, and they all happened to be minorities ...

You were so interested in Civil Services for the last 05 years and why are you suddenly shifting to the Corporate sector now ? Are you after money? Don’t you want to do govt service anymore or work for the public, that you have advocated so much for half a decade?I have got a lot of accusations, of being money minded, this and that in the PMs in Quora.This is an answer to everyone, an answer which would describe my thought process in taking this particular decision.Before, starting with that, let us understand the structure of the Government’s Bureaucracy. That will help us have more clarity, in understanding my decision.The Government is divided into Levels, according to the 7th Central Pay Commission. There are totally 18 levels, with 03 entry points.Level 01 - 05 - Lower ServicesLevel 06 - 09 - Middle ServicesLevel 10 - 18 -Now, I have always aspired for the upper civil services, usually conducted by the UPSC, which deals with the upper management of the Government.This is where most of the “thinking” is done, this is where policies are “ideated” and this is where public policies are “drafted”.An IAS joins at Level 09 during training, and then starts off from Level 10, and has the possibility of having more than 07 promotions in his career of 35 years.This is where I wanted to be, join the bureaucracy, and then rise high enough to shape the policy-making. (Usually around Level 13 or so)Now, I have been working with the MHA for the last two years, at Level 07.This is the middle management services.This is where the policies which areWorking in rural Bihar for the last 02 years, I have understood the exact ground realities, of where exactly it is going wrong, and how the policy drafting needs a bit change, by someone who has actual on-ground realistic experiences.But, a Level 07 employee can grow upto max of Level 10 or 11, where you start competing with junior IAS officers when you are about to retire. (Example Promoted SP vs IPS SP)So, in a span of 35 years, I will get only 3–5 promotions, and that too will be still stuck in middle management, and never reach the “ideation” and “policy-drafting” stages.So, how do I make a shift from “Policy Implementation” to “Policy Drafting” now? Which is where I really want to be.I am not able to clear the UPSC exam. I have tried.I am stuck in middle management, away from home, with an unstable life, mediocre salary, erratic transfers and postings, very few promotions and very slow career growth and strained personal relationships.If I get married to anyone soon, she would want to work in a city, which would again increase long distance and put more strain on the family.So, how do I make a shift from “Policy Implementation” to “Policy Drafting” considering all these factors?The answer came here -And this privatization of the Government by bringing in external specialists is going to increase a lot in the next two decades or so.And they are getting Joint Secretary posts directly, which is a Level 15 post. A direct jump from Level 07 to Level 15, and if I stay I would retire by Level 10.I had to think.I had a plan.A long-term plan, with lots of risks and possibilities of failing.Get into the corporate sector.The lateral entry needs 15 years of total work-ex. I already have 05 years work-ex (Startup, Sabre and MHA)I need to work for 10 years, a decade in the corporate sector, after which I can make a shift to upper civil services - Level 15 in a very short time.And I have seen the 6000 applicants - Some are good, some are okay, not that stellar - I know my work ex in the Central Government in rural Bihar would stand out and would get a chance to interview for the Joint Secretary posts - This is 10 years later I am talking about - 2030 - When I am around 38 years old.So, how do I jump into the corporate sector?Some private job which deals with Public Policy or Development Consultancy or Social Impact or Public Administration jobs ?Also, I need a post-graduation, ensuring all the educational qualifications are in place.So, I made a list of colleges/schools/institutes which would get me a Post Grad and a job in the public policy sector domain.And I wanted to apply for Indian schools only - Not, US, UK, Asian, etc. No INSEAD, NUS, LBS, nah - They don’t align with my goals.I could have tried CAT for the IIMs PGDM, but I am too old for that, with 5 years of work ex, I wouldn’t get much of public policy related jobs.I could have tried for IIMs Executive MBA, the PGPX and EPGP, again they don’t specialize in Public Policy analysis that well.ISB made the perfect sense to me.ISB has a specialization/major in Public Policy - Govt of Andhra, Telangana, Dalberg, Cargill - All working in PP sector come for placements. I could try for management consulting for govt sector or development consulting roles - Which are around 200 jobs in total.Work for 10 years in the Corporate sector with Public Policy.Higher pay, urban life, faster promotions, happy family life - And most importantly, I can focus on public policy ideation.And a decade later, apply for the lateral entry to the Government as Joint Secretary posts.And then see what will happen.I know it is a long shot. But a plan had to be formed.And that is why the MBA. At this juncture.I am 27 years old. Time is running out.A One-Year flagship ISB MBA made sense to me, which will plunge me to the upper public policy analysis sector of the corporate world.And that is why theIt is not the money or the getting suited up or anything.I had the goal of Govt Policy ideation and drafting 05 years ago. UPSC was the best way to do it. It didn’t happen.So, now will try the second best way to reach the goals.The ends are the same. Only the means have changed.ISB - IITM - MHA - GoI - Quora - Rural Bihar.All are dots that are now being connected.As I said, my story hasn’t ended yet.It has only begun.",121 followers,Scott Thompson,22.9K,1.2K,3.1M,https://www.quora.com/Is-it-a-good-idea-to-learn-as-much-as-possible-about-the-company-you-are-interviewing-for

Not that there’s anything wrong with that, but I also enjoy the finer things in life and I don’t like to rely on anyone else to get them.I punted. I applied to graduate school and thought about eventually getting a PhD in Art History. I had a 4.0 college GPA, two internships at highly venerated Los Angeles museums, great recommendations from my professors, as well as a published thesis paper. I was certain one of the master’s programs I applied to would accept me. Six grad school applications, several essays, a GRE and lots of waiting led me to being repeatedly rejected by EVERY. SINGLE. PROGRAM. with the exception of McGill university in Montreal who put me on a waiting list.FUCK.Who am I if I’m not some member of the academia, the girl who has bookshelves stacked with memoirs by Caillebotte and Cassat. Who am I if I can’t speak with authority while I tour Europe casually with friends:Internal monologue ensues:Enter, University of Portland Pamplin School of Business.I spoke to their program advisor, did some research, looked into Portland, applied to the school, got accepted because of my GRE score and gpa but needed to work on a lot of prerequisites in the summer term to catch up. I found an apartment, moved, bada bing bada boom.Two years later I became an associate at a top financial advisory firm. Now I’m a portfolio manager. If I went with getting a PhD in art history I would still be in school with no promise of employment after I graduate. I work 8–5 M-F and have full benefits (401k, vacation, sick time, insurance, paid medical leave etc.). I come home from work and my work is at the office, I don’t take anything home with me. I close my office door at 5pm and it’s “see ya tomorrow”. And the best part is, I actually really like my job. It’s fun and I’ve discovered new talents.Is my experience the experience of every MBA grad? No, certainly not. I had a lot of catching up and hard work to get there. I had family support and a full time job while doing school full time. I ate ramen noodles and hard boiled eggs for the better part of two years. I made significant relationships with advisors and professors. I asked the right questions.All in all my student loans amount to about $60,000. Pricey? Yeah, of course. But with my background I never would have obtained this type of job/salary without the MBA.

Apparently, it was given to the best translator from French into Russian and was highly prestigious. I was incredibly proud of myself. I came to Moscow by hitchhiking. And received my Prize.However, during the ceremony I’ve met the jury that had made the choice. I was shocked to find that I was very well acquainted with two of the seven members of the jury. One of them smiled at me and said:Next year, in 2016, as a laureate, I was elected to the Wachsmacher Prize jury. The job was not an easy one: we had to read dozens of French books and compare them with their Russian translations. After some online discussions, we’ve met in Moscow to take a final decision. It was there that I realized how tough are some of my co-jurors. One of them especially impressed me by his meticulousness. As he had also been on the jury of the previous year, I asked him how I was chosen.-And I understood that I was really not a bad translator, after all.P. S.
