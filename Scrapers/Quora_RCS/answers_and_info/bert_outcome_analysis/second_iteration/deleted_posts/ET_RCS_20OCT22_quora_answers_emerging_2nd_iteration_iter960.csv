In 1980, I was assigned to do all new juvenile cataloging. For juvenile titles, CIP includes a one or two sentence summary. As a sample, here's the summary fromMe being me, I couldn't help reading and critiquing these summaries. Some were things of beauty, others awkward, most mediocre. (How would you judge that summary above?) Of course, this is a very small part of the job of an LC cataloguer, and I'm morally certain that writing skills aren't very high on the list. But since 1980, my absolute dream job is to be the person who writes those summaries. No other part of the job, just read all the new children's books and write concise summaries. How sweet is that?

I have knows a few people in A&R and they were pretty frustrated people.Owning and running a mid sized successful record label that released artists and albums I would be proud of would be nice as well.Movie director and writer, preferably where you direct and write your own movies would be wonderful, that kind of legacy is something I think of often, being able to leave your small mark on the world, in whatever way you can.Song writer would be another, especially with that whole legacy thing.  Knowing you wrote even one popular song, one that will be remembered for years, decades, maybe even centuries is a pretty awesome though.Here's an odd one!  Professional bowler!  I do love bowling and did actually look into it as I was not too bad and thought maybe I could get my average up high enough to make a living at it.I think no matter what the job, it would not be a job where I am famous or recognized, except maybe by name at most.

As you’re strolling down the dark, deserted road, a pair of strong hands grab you from behind and put a damp cloth over your nose, muffling your breath. You begin to thrash and jerk in an attempt to get loose but then, everything starts to become hazy. You feel your strength draining. And as consciousness slowly leaves your body, you let go of the struggle and give in to the oncoming darkness.When you next wake up, you find yourself in a strange room, lying on a hard metallic bed. Your head is sore. Your entire body hurts like hell. And your chest feels as if it has been recently stabbed with a thousand hot knives. Trying to get a grip over the pain, you look sideways. Right next to your bed, there is a stand on which a lot of surgical tools are kept. As the realization dawns over you, you suddenly feel your chest getting a hundred times heavier. You tilt your head forward and look. What you see there, sends shards of horror piercing through your brain.Strapped to your bare naked chest is a time-bomb!In a panicked frenzy, you heave yourself up into a sitting position.You look closer.There is a messy tangle of red, green and white wires swathed around a ring of dynamite grade explosive, forming an ugly nest over your chest. Cascaded inside it, is a big red dial. On that dial, there is a timer. You know it is a timer because the display is blinking and changing every second. But the weird thing is that digits themselves look nothing like you have ever seen before. They seem to be in some strange language that you don't recognize. You have no way of knowing how long before the bomb goes off!You grab the dial and try to get the damn thing off your chest.You can't.A sinking dread engulfs you as you realize that the bomb's straps are not tied around you as you expected. The entire thing has been surgically fused into your chest!You look around in blind terror.The entire room is deserted. The door is ajar. You summon all your strength, get up from the bed and limp towards the open door, afraid that the assailant might return any minute.But to your surprise, you meet no one. No one stops you. You somehow make it out of the building and keep going - without turning, without looking back - until you are far far away...The police say they found no one in that building. The assailant, whoever he was, left no trace of his identity. As for the bomb, the doctors wouldn’t dare to touch it. The risk if too much, they say. But other than that, they promise you'll completely recover. The pain too would subside in a week or so. And thankfully, it does. A month later, you’re completely fine. The bomb is still there - fused into your chest. A forensic analysis reveals that it is unlike anything anyone has ever seen before. For one, it is highly stable. It is completely insensitive to physical or chemical changes. Experts assure you short of trying to get it surgically removed from your body, there is no way the bomb is going to go off on its own. Not until the timer runs out, of course. Which is another mystery. The script from which the digits have been taken doesn't appear to belong to any language known to man. The linguists of the world are completely stumped. ""Maybe it is Enochian,"" one of them tries to be funny on national television.You are not amused. Because for you, it is no joke. You are now a ticking time-bomb and worse still, you have no way of knowing when you will go off. It might happen tomorrow or might take several decades. Just that some unfortunate day, when the timer runs out, there will be a spectacular blast and you'll be gone. The bomb strapped to your chest is a constant reminder of that.It is the first thing you see when you wake up in the morning. And the last thing you notice when you go to bed at night. It is there when you eat. It is there when you shit. It is there when you fuck. You can't shake the feeling that you are a man living on borrowed time - a dead man walking!What next?For sure, the initial few months would be sheer torture. You would be living in constant panic, and denial, and anger. You wouldn't be able to sleep, dreading that the bomb might go off while you’re asleep. Every waking moment would be torture too. The apprehension, the dread, the not knowing will almost kill you. Or you might end up killing yourself by committing suicide.However, if you somehow live through all of that; as time goes by, you will slowly begin to come to terms with your new reality.Life, as they say, will go on.And I have a very strong feeling that this new life of yours would be radically different.For one, the things that you dearly held onto in your past life - your worries, your troubles, your problems - wouldn't seem to matter as much in this new reality, would they?The people you viciously hated, I think you would hate them a lot less (what’s the point anyway?) ; and those you loved, you would love much more fiercely.You wouldn't be bogged down by small meaningless muddles of daily life, nor tied up in the incessant background noise of the world. Since your life is short and uncertain anyway, maybe you'll try to live it in the bigger pictures.Your existence is already a hostage to that bloody bomb on your chest, so what more would you have to fear? What further harm could a few risks here and there cause you?I have a feeling that you’ll act a lot braver.You won't be caught up in the same old loops. You'll experiment a bit more, be afraid a lot less, say yes more often and do good without reason.And maybe in all of that, you'll find yourself strangely free, and maybe…As the years pass, you even might come across days when you completely forget about the bomb. But alas! just a look down at your chest would be enough to jolt you back into reality and remind you of your impeding mortality.Do you know the only difference between this thought experiment and real life?In real life, we don't wear a constant reminder of our mortality strapped to our chests.In real life, the bomb is not visible.But just because it isn't doesn't mean it isn't there.It is.Death, my friend, is coming for us all.",496 followers,Salman Shamsi,1.3K,85,745.3K,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-trippy-thought-experiments-2

You either leave the lever alone and the trolley kills five people or you pull the lever and the trolleyYou have two distinct options. You either leave the lever alone and the trolley kills five people or you pull the lever and the trolleyHere comes the tricky partNow imagine the same runaway trolley. You and a fat man are standing on a bridge with railroads passing beneath. Suddenly you notice the runaway trolley going towards five tied persons, laying on the tracks. Your only option to save them is to push the fat man off the bridge so that he blocks the path for the trolley.Should you do that?This is where most of the people say that they wouldn't push the fat man off the bridge, but what's the difference? In both cases we have a situation where one person is sacrificed in order to save five.As it turns out, the problem with moral decisions doesn't stem just from the outcomes of our actions, but also from the manner in which we carry out those actions. There are various explanations why people think that pushing the fat man off the bridge is wrong, while pulling the lever is right. Basically, in the first case you didn't have the intention to kill someone, while in the second case, you purposely killed someone, intending their death. Also, it's worth noting that in the first case, the person you decided to sacriface was already tied and lying on the track, but in the other case, the person was free and you decided to push him off the bridge. Most of the people just seem to feel that it's the matter of responsibility. In the first case, they feel, whoever tied the person is the one to blame for his death, while in the second case, most of the people feel that they are the ones to be blamed, should they choose to push the fat man off the bridge.To broaden the moral dilemma even more, let's imagine that this fat man was a man who tied five people in the first place. Should you push him off the bridge this time. The situation is the same - you still have to push an unsuspecting person off the bridge in order to save lives, but this time you would do it, I presume. It turns out that this time, you judge the moral decisions by the outcome instead of judging it by the manner the action was carried out in. Why is it so? Why do we feel repulsed by the idea of pushing the innocent fat man off the bridge, but it seems like moral imperative to do so if that man is a villain. Should moral judgements be based on outcomes or manners in which the action has been carried out?",94 followers,Ben Levy,612,1.6K,3.9M,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-trippy-thought-experiments-2

So Friday isn’t the solution.The prisoner just happens to be an expert at logic, and on Thursday morning they realise that since the execution can’t occur on Friday, then Thursday would have to the date of the execution, so it (once again) wouldn’t be a surprise. So Thursday also isn’t a solution.Applying this concept on each day, the prisoner comes to the conclusion that it is indeed impossible for this execution to come as a surprise. As a result, they confidently tell the warden that the judge was lying about the fact that the execution would be a surprise and (reluctantly) the prisoner’s sentence is commuted.This principle would also apply in many other situations.Suppose your teacher told you that there will be a test given during a lesson at some point during the year but no student will ever know that the test is taking place during that lesson.The same logic applies, and the teacher has created a paradox for themselves and in fact just given a false statement to their students.So what is the solution to these problems?There is no solution to these situations!
