The important thing is what you understand from these courses. Try to do some awesome projects from what you have learned from that particular course this will give you a thorough understanding of the course material and you get a project to show case your achievement.Employers look more at projects than certificates. I hope this will clear your doubts.Thank you",8 followers,Abhishek Ranjan,1.6K,181,2M,https://www.quora.com/Are-certificate-courses-done-on-Coursera-helpful-in-getting-jobs-at-product-based-companies

One is hoping that the 2:1 degree they hold plus a little work experience to date will be enough to swing the panel in their favour.Do MOOC certificates showcase skills?Certificates can show that the holder has a thorough theoretical knowledge of their subject; has completed a period of practical work related to their subject or, has theoretical knowledge which they have demonstrated through practical work.Certificates as proof of additional engagement and additional skills beyond the organised university lectureMOOCs certainly represent a move away from traditional advance education; they are a reinvention of the way we learn. Introduced in 2006, by 2012 they had established themselves as a popular mode of learning.Do employers take MOOCs seriously?The positive response to this would be that MOOCs are certainly gaining in popularity with employers but that knowledge of them outside Western Europe, Latin America and other English-speaking countries is generally low, but improving.Certificates need to be acknowledged so employers have to trust the educational body which issued the certificateAn MOOC has to be recognised as having value. There are two ways in which this is being achieved. On completion, a small fee will result in the award of a valid statement of participation and accreditation from the educational establishment involved.MOOCs increasing in popularity in Africa and other places where distance and expense are factors working against advanced educationUnlike having to attend lectures at a traditional university, which require the student to overcome the challenges of distance and expense, providing they have access to the Internet, they can complete an MOOC.If you like my answer, do me a favor andClick on my· Extensive guides (How-to Descriptions)· Product links with recommendations and discounts· Invitation to my Messenger Chat",16 followers,Daniel Bourke,2.1K,178,7.6M,https://www.quora.com/Are-certificate-courses-done-on-Coursera-helpful-in-getting-jobs-at-product-based-companies

Certainly the exact mechanism used here — a Joint Fundraising Committee agreement (JFC) between Clinton and the DNC — was of interest to me, since it revealed a lot about the exact relationship between the DNC and the Clinton campaign. But beyond that it’s hard for me to get really animated about this, because… well, by the standards of American political parties this kind of coordination is really not surprising or new.People need to understand that primaries themselves are pretty new concepts in American politics. I’m going to try to avoid a long history lesson on party conventions and the emergence of the primary system in the 20th century here, because that’s not really what this question is asking about. Suffice it to say, the modern system of binding primaries and/or caucuses in both parties was only established in 1972. Prior to that time, a few states had primaries, but they served as “beauty contests,” a chance for candidates to show off their ability to appeal to voters. Up to 1972, the voters had very little say in the choice of presidential candidates; delegates were largely selected by state party organizations, and the choice of a nominee was made during the conventions by the delegates under the close supervision of party leaders.The idea that a nominee would be chosen who was not supported by a majority of party leaders was unthinkable for most of the history of American parties. So the fact that party leaders were in some way coordinating with a favored candidate is hardly surprising. What’s more, I’d be surprised if you looked at past nominating contests over the last 30–40 years, and any time there was a contest with one clear frontrunner, you did not find some form of coordination. I’d be really surprised, for example, if the RNC wasn’t in some way coordinating with George W. Bush against John McCain in 2000, though I wouldn’t speculate as to the exact nature of that coordination. This is what parties do, or at least what they have historically done; they choose candidates who are acceptable to the existing party leadership, and then market that candidate to voters.There was even a prominent book about this process written by some political scientists back in 2008; it was calledSo in many respects I don’t find any of thisI do, however, think that the revelations are verySo did it change my mind about whether Clinton won “fairly”? Not really, because I always assumed that the support of party leaders was an advantage for Clinton in the race. Did it change my opinion about how the DNC should operate in the future? Absolutely.As to the subject of “rigging,” however, I still take issue with the idea that the primary was “rigged.” A rigged primary would be one in which the outcome was preordained; one in which Sanders never had a chance to win. I did not think that was the case before these revelations and I don’t think it’s the case now. Let me explain why.One of the things that really amazed and dismayed me during the 2016 Democratic primary was the degree to which people started dramatically, DRAMATICALLY overstating the importance of both the national party committee and committee chairperson in determining the outcome of the primaries.The DNC and RNC are basically fundraising organizations. Their respective chairs are basically fundraising coordinators. They don’t control how people vote. They don’t even have much influence over how people vote.Now, the JFC Clinton set up with the DNC allowed her to raise more money than she’d have been able to on her own under campaign finance laws, because some of that money was supposed to be shared with the DNC and the state party committees. Sanders, it is important to note, ALSO had a JFC agreement with the DNC, and I’d bet that Martin O’Malley did too. Trump had one with the RNC. The difference for Clinton was that her agreement allowed her some control over the personnel in executive positions within the DNC. She also appears to have kept a lot more of the money than she was supposed to. So the deal gave her greater say in decisions the DNC made, and allowed her to raise more money.Did this “rig” the primary for Clinton, denying Sanders any chance to win? I’m not really sure how it would. The DNC scheduled debates in a way that favored Clinton; this is the clearest consequence of this agreement. But Sanders matched or exceeded Clinton’s fundraising during the primaries. He did not lose for lack of money. The fundraising advantage Clinton’s JFC agreement gave her doesn’t seem to have mattered much in the primary because of how good Sanders was at raising money. And if anything, the dispute over the scheduling of the debates probably created more attention for them than they might otherwise have received, and the simple fact that you can STILL stream video of the debates online today shows that issues like “TV scheduling” matter less and less in modern politics. I just don’t see how this became a decisive advantage. And I don’t really know much of anything else the DNC could or did do that might have influenced how voters voted in the primaries. The DNC did not count the votes; county boards of elections do that, and they are set up with the intention of being nonpartisan, and in the case of primaries allow every campaign to observe the counting process. So this wasn’t a “stolen” or “rigged” election, but it also wasn’t one in which the candidates started out on a level playing field.Clinton had an advantage in that the party leadership supported her going into the race. The deal she made with the DNC was one reflection of that advantage. In that sense, it was never a “fair” contest in that Clinton had a lot of party leaders acting as surrogates for her, providing her with organizational and fundraising help in their states, and voting for her as superdelegates. So it was never really “fair” in the sense that they each started in the same position. Sanders was an outsider who was not a member of the party and whom few people had heard of prior to his entry into the race. It wasn’t a “fair” fight, but it also was not one in which the outcome was predetermined. It would have been a major upset if Sanders won, but upsets HAVE happened before, and will again.Again, I think the DNC needs to make sure nothing like this agreement ever happens again. But beyond that… the public’s expectation of “fairness” in nominating contests has not matched the historical reality of those contests.",128 followers,Els Pol,2K,353,534.7K,https://www.quora.com/Will-Hillary-Clinton-cheating-during-debates-by-getting-questions-in-advance-from-Donna-Brazile-hurt-her-in-the-polls

Obviously a student would bone up on all major historical events before the exam, and knowing one question isn’t going to relieve the student of the need to study and prepare for other questions.One thing that is obvious from the Podesta emails is that a lot of people frequently sent unsolicited comments, ideas, and suggestions .. some of them really obvious, some of them really dumb — and I don’t really see what the point would be in wasting Hillary’s time by communicating those sort of mundane details. Maybe it’s something that would have been told to whoever was working with Hillary for debate prep … but those issues should have covered in debate prep anyway.I think it might have been significant if the questions referred to some obscure point or an unpredictable question — the type of questions that do sometimes trip up candidates.I think it was dumb for Brazile to pass on that information….but I just don’t see that the information itself was worth conveying to a very busy Presidential candidate who probably didn’t need to be prompted on how to answer easy questions.Now that I think about it — I think those “leaked” questions were probably more about Brazile’s personal desire to get in good with the campaign than the actual value of the information. That is, maybe Brazile was hoping to be appointed to a plum job with the Clinton administration, post-election, and so sharing some sort of inside information was her way of bringing attention to herself.",154 followers,David DePriest,1.7K,207,649.2K,https://www.quora.com/Will-Hillary-Clinton-cheating-during-debates-by-getting-questions-in-advance-from-Donna-Brazile-hurt-her-in-the-polls

Even though I was in top 4 in the batch.When I asked them why they told that I do not have enough projects, I requested them to let me continue, to which they said I need to pay 50K upfront if I want to continue.Many other people were told this, this is something that I confirmed before joining multiple times and their team said I won't be required to pay anything until I get placed and they will tell you the same thing but after you join the course within some months they will surely ask you for money.Don't believe it ??? Join it for yourself lol waste your many months and you will get to know.Anyways since I was not having a job offer so I paid the amount, I did 3 projects on my own and whenever I needed help their teachers said contact teacher's assistant and their teachers assistant were not able to solve my doubt.After requesting multiple times they stopped replying to my messages, but I was able to continue the classes for now, while teachers stopped taking my questions in the lecture.Later I realised a few of their classes which they were prentending to take live, were actually recorded and the questions or doubts they were answer were of previous batch students and they just played the same video faking that its live for next batches.Finally, still I continued with the course after 6 months they said they can't refer me to companies as my mentor hours were not enough.I sent them screenshots of emails where I had been asking about doubt sessions and mentor hours and they were not replying to me.Then they said my projects were not enough, I told sent them my projects and actually I had most projects and then they stopped replying to me again.Finally I started preparing in my own after wasting 7 months and one of my friends referred me to Rapido company and I cracked the job and to be honest their training didn't even help me at all it was all my learning and courses that I did from udemyI posted this on my LinkedIn, the very next day I got call about congratulations and actually later I realised that they are calling me for payment. I refused to pay so they threatened me for legal action.What the hell guys ! Who takes legal action on its students and you guys had no credit for me getting placed in Rapido.Later I relaised the same thing was happening with others too, they are not partnered with even one company, they rely upon if students get job on their own and are stupid enough to pay ISA amount of 3 lakhs to them as they trained them.I will say if you want such training you can do such trainitn from Udemy or Coursera these are much cheaper and better.Never ever fall in trap with fake reviews on the website.There is one video of student review on their website, if you check it properly and research a little of linkedin acrually the guy is a college friend of one of the founder and is giving fake reviews.Somebody should take legal action against them for such fake reviews, misleading students, and threatening us for legal action.I was getting call from them almost everyday about paymentLater on I told them to take legal action against me and said if you take legal action against me I will tell this fake review thing in court, and I took all screenshot and videos of that fake review on website thinking what if rhey delete it.And truth is as of today it's still there 🤣My review want to waste 6 months of your life go ahead and join it.Also they will post fake review on this Quora too and will get fake upvotes on those fake reviews too and will mark my question spam but I will never stop posting it.Edit :This question was marked spam by Quora as these guys created many fake IDs to get it removed but I mailed Quora and they restored it",3 followers,Josh Begleiter,1.3K,632,1.4M,https://www.quora.com/Can-I-do-MBA-after-B-COM-pass
