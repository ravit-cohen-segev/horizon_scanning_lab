Also, bear in mind I am talking aboutThere is indeed a systemic flaw in the Indian education system that stymies the growth of innovation. Here are a few points that come to my mind and the possible reasons why they exist:1. The fix-it v/s build-it mindset:I understand that immediately after independence, we needed engineers who could fix things and kick start our economy. ~70 years later, most of us are still stuck in that mindset.2. Emphasis on memorizing over applying:One reason why I think this is the case is that we didn't have information on our fingertips in the past. To look up some data, one would have to go to the library, get the right book, look it up in the right sections etc and that would be time consuming; so knowing these things by heart would save a lot of time. But things have changed and information is readily available in a snap. Inertia has prevented us from moving on.3. The old school mindset of attendance and note taking:This gives me a good segue to the next point.4. The rigidity of our education system:Our population and the number of students enrolled for engineering probably does not allow the system to be flexible to each and every student. But with modern technology, I am sure things can be worked out so each student studies what he/she actually wants to.Although I said I would stick to engineering and higher education, I would like to make a comment on the schools and primary education as well. I have volunteered for various events that promote STEM (Science Technology Engineering and Math) among school kids over here and it amazes me how inquisitive and curious the kids are. They are encouraged to ask questions from an early age and they are taught things practically, outside the realms of the textbook.I was a volunteer for one such event and they were teaching surface tension to 5th and 6th graders. Instead of just giving them the formula and reading out things from the textbook, an experiment was done in front of them andSo all in all, yes; the Indian education system does have a problem and it is",18 followers,Asim Qureshi,5.5K,996,155.5M,https://www.quora.com/Which-is-the-good-college-for-data-science-in-Greater-Noida-under-AKTU

This assumption totally ignores the socioeconomic factors needed to produce wealth.And concern about education system is not limited to India. World's richest country and home to the most number of great universities frets about losing to India and China in education. Here is a report on comparing the education systems of the 3 top economies.Page on americanprogress.orgIndeed, the two countries most rapidly gaining on the United States in terms of economic competitiveness—China and India—have ambitious national strategies of investing and promoting improved educational outcomes for children to strengthen their positions as contenders in the global economy.In short, there is not much wrong about the education system or education approach itself. Sure, so many things have to be changed. But, comparing the education of my nephews and nieces in various US cities vs education in India, I don't see substantial differences.The real reason why India is lagging behind is because:We need to fix these lower hanging fruits first before we get something more ambitious. In fact, this is how we manage anything in corporations. We put out a whole bunch of priorities [I have over 80 items in my product backlog], but have only 4-5 things to be really done for my product launch next week. It doesn't mean the rest 75 are not important, just that these 5 are so important that we need to do them first. For India, these 5 are the most important to me.Make sure the pregnant mothers are healthy, grow healthy babies that get to school passing all the way to high school in classrooms with basic infrastructure with teachers coming regularly. Doing just this basic thing alone would get India close to the international standards.

The courses taught are very different in all the regions of India.-Those differences are topped with unqualified teachers. It’s not their fault as well because the teachers are not paid enough salary so there very less percentage of population who wants to jump in that profession.-Next is the languages we speak and the languages we learn from. In spite of having so many different languages we choose to teach our children in English language. Which is not bad, but we do not focus on teaching the language first, we only want to see how many marks the student can score in math and science. If the basics of English language are not clear to the student, how can we expect them to succeed in other parts of their studies?-Third is there is very less practical teaching and more of theoretical teaching. How can we aspect a student to understand something if we do not show it to them.-There is a very bad thinking that sports is not good if you want to be successful. We have forgotten that a healthy body and a healthy mind both have to work together not separate. We do not focus on sports at all. Sports teach us the value of teamwork, efforts and never giving up.-The next big problem is our students cannot speak in any language with confidence. That is happening because of the cultural differences, technology and media. We really need to reimagine this system.-The biggest problem I see is that everyone wants to become either Doctor or Engineers. It’s not their fault. It’s their parents who want to have a status in the society that “my son/daughter is an Engineer/Doctor”. We can relate this situation with the movie 3 idiots in which there is a scene where Aamir khan says, if it’s a girl then Doctor and if it’s a boy then Engineer. There are only 7000 IIT seats available every year and god knows how many candidates appear for the exam.-The school and collages have become just a medium of business. Their only goal is to make profit and nothing else. On top of that there are tuition classes which are the star of the show. Some cities in India are known for these classes such as Kota. The systems there is very simple, study for 18 hours a day and get admission in IIT. We think that studying hard and getting good marks is the only way for success. Where is the value? Are we making a human being or are we making a donkey in the process? The answer is very clear. Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak said in an interview that Indians are not creative. He is 100% right. We strive for marks and becoming topper in the exam and not creating something now or useful.-The books and the courses taught in schools and colleges are outdated. Students need to explore more before deciding what career to choose.-There is a lot of pressure from teachers, parents and the society that failure is not an option. This is the main reason of rising suicide rates in students.With the improvement in media it is possible that we can become a better educated country. It has to start with educating our society and most importantly the parents.Parents need to understand their children. It is 100% true that every person in the world is different and everyone has a unique talent. We are so caught up in faking our lives that we forget our natural self and adopt our fake self. The same thing happens with children. They are so busy doing what their parents say, or doing what their teachers say that they forget their original selves. As a parent the number one job toward their children is that identify their uniqueness and work towards improving those. These qualities can also be called as Strengths. No wonder why everyone copies the strengths section from google. That’s because students never spend time on focusing on those. There is no exercise or course which shows us how to do it.The sole purpose of education should be creating the best version of their students.We really needed to focus on improving the quality of education for our young generations. It has to start now or else we will be so deep in the whole of this fake education that we will be a country full of educated donkeys.",2 followers,Rose Cruz,1.3K,254,9.6M,https://www.quora.com/Which-is-the-good-college-for-data-science-in-Greater-Noida-under-AKTU

Do what I love and I’ll starve to death is what I think. Sure, there’s a lot of people out there who have managed to find ways to monetize the things they love doing, but the vast majority, including myself, are not one of them.So I graduated with two useless degrees, that is unless I wanted to charm people with my art history anecdotes at dinner parties or play piano at a Nordstrom while moonlighting at dark sweaty jazz bars. Not that there’s anything wrong with that, but I also enjoy the finer things in life and I don’t like to rely on anyone else to get them.I punted. I applied to graduate school and thought about eventually getting a PhD in Art History. I had a 4.0 college GPA, two internships at highly venerated Los Angeles museums, great recommendations from my professors, as well as a published thesis paper. I was certain one of the master’s programs I applied to would accept me. Six grad school applications, several essays, a GRE and lots of waiting led me to being repeatedly rejected by EVERY. SINGLE. PROGRAM. with the exception of McGill university in Montreal who put me on a waiting list.FUCK.Who am I if I’m not some member of the academia, the girl who has bookshelves stacked with memoirs by Caillebotte and Cassat. Who am I if I can’t speak with authority while I tour Europe casually with friends:Internal monologue ensues:Enter, University of Portland Pamplin School of Business.I spoke to their program advisor, did some research, looked into Portland, applied to the school, got accepted because of my GRE score and gpa but needed to work on a lot of prerequisites in the summer term to catch up. I found an apartment, moved, bada bing bada boom.Two years later I became an associate at a top financial advisory firm. Now I’m a portfolio manager. If I went with getting a PhD in art history I would still be in school with no promise of employment after I graduate. I work 8–5 M-F and have full benefits (401k, vacation, sick time, insurance, paid medical leave etc.). I come home from work and my work is at the office, I don’t take anything home with me. I close my office door at 5pm and it’s “see ya tomorrow”. And the best part is, I actually really like my job. It’s fun and I’ve discovered new talents.Is my experience the experience of every MBA grad? No, certainly not. I had a lot of catching up and hard work to get there. I had family support and a full time job while doing school full time. I ate ramen noodles and hard boiled eggs for the better part of two years. I made significant relationships with advisors and professors. I asked the right questions.All in all my student loans amount to about $60,000. Pricey? Yeah, of course. But with my background I never would have obtained this type of job/salary without the MBA. So it was definitely worth it for me.You need to ask yourself, do you want to live to work or work to live?I prefer the latter.","2,730 followers",Victoria Zorzoli,1.2K,77,3.2M,https://www.quora.com/Which-is-the-good-college-for-data-science-in-Greater-Noida-under-AKTU

What do you know about Mr. Gurdip Singh Anand? He was such a noble personality and wise gentleman. It was just 2 months in campus and he guided me like he would have guided his grandchildren. May be you were never able to see the love he had for us. Maybe you did not give a try to talk to him, you said this because you created the perception of the man just my looking him through the glass doors. You were stuck living in your own stupidI am so ashamed of you.Second, you said our college is fraud the quality of teachers is bad. Ok fine we would assume so. But how many lectures have you really attended? It would certainly be possible to gather your attendance details, if you were so truthful about our college then why you did not reveal your identity? You act so innocent now, but you lied too soon. As far my knowledge takes me, 80% of attendance is mandatory and if you really had an issue about the faculty, why did you not go and talk to them personally? You, dear gentleman are aDear Sir/Madam,Have you every attended the finance lecture of Prof. Bose, or may be you would be talking about Prof Vijay Tandon Sir? He has been the most creative person with such an aura that we were mesmerised to present in his class, oh no you would surely be talking about theEvery professor in UBS is highly qualified and carries megatons of experience andDear Sir/Madam,We got our degrees and there are many students of CMBA and UEMBA who got there degrees and all of them are legit and we all got placed by placement team and surely you are no superior to the MNC’s and their verification agencies. Do you really think you can out process the agencies who are payed heavily by these MNC’s and produce a certificate of our own?Examples of few of ourPartha Paul: CMBA9: Yes Bank.Rahul Thakurta: CMBA8: PMG Asia.Shubham Roy: PGDM3: Gulf Oil.Achyut Singh: PGDM3: Unicharm, ICICI Securities.Kelvin Fernandes: PGDM3: ITC Ltd.Krishna: PGDM3: Dun & BradstreetSuruchi: CMBA10: Accenture.Abhishek: CMBA7: Oyo Rooms.The list is too long for you to even comprehend.Boy Boy Boy, You would have been born with a silver spoon, that you were able to afford the luxury of eating food outside hostel premises. Actually you should have stayed at your home to get your tickly tongue satisfied.WiFi… Do you even know the full form? The man behind IT Help Desk - Mr. Mayur Pathak has been with us even at 4AM in the morning to fix all our issues. Do not even get me started on that.OMG, there is no network coverage in the campus so we used to send telegrams and postcards to our parents. Why don't you stop whining about petty inconveniences in life ?No CEO’s on campus for lecture right? But surprisingly we had all the privilege to attend the guest lectures throughout the course of 2 years, but I am really afraid that you missed out the same during your induction week, global CEO series and as well as external guest lectures on Saturdays.Placement team is really shit! Ouch that hurts! even I was one of the placement cell member and we know what hard work that is to be done in the background to get incompetent, ignorant and coward students like you my Majesty who has majestically been able to sit in front of a laptop using the Wi-Fi of the college complaining about the people who worked their arse off to provide placements and a guarantee of a respectable salary which exceeds your miniscule and mediocre capacity.Coming to Prof. Vidhya Srinivas now:- I can bet on this you do not know her on a personal level and have misunderstood her. Sir/Madam, YOUR assumptions are not sufficient to break her will of still treating you like her own children. You do not know what she goes through while looking for those sweet apples which you call placement. Do not assassinate somebodies character because of your baseless and shallow understanding.Words will never be able to describe the kind of mental pressure she was going through our placement season. Being answerable to the parents. Can you even comprehend the seriousness of answering a parents call filled with trust and concern for their ward’s careers. I pretty sure my now that you would not be even able to answer a single question shot by YOUR classmates during a presentation.I only wish that you would be as dedicated and studious as you think. You could ask any of the security personnel to open up a study room. If you were so dedicated and unable to do that then you would have taken the pain to move your lazy ass around and have a little chat with Mr. Amol Borale.NowI was honoured to serve as one of the VP’s of the company. you will never appreciate the sweetness of the fruit because your mindset is toxic and tongue is bitter.If students smoke openly in their rooms and do drugs, why do you not try to be a nice and responsible gentleman who actually cares about their friends and is genuinely concerned about them - talk to them about it and give them another shot at rehabilitating their lives and get a clean start again?Apologies for the long answer but I could not resist this cowardly act to defame my Alma Mater. Feel free to ask any questions.
