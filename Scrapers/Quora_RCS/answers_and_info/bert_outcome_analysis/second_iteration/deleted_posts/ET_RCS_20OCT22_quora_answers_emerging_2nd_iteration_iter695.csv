4,"A Microscope worth less than a dollar & a computer that runs on Water!!!FoldscopeA Microscope worth less than a dollar & a computer that runs on Water!!!FoldscopeHis TED Talk on Foldscope invention has got more than 3 Lacs views on YouTube.The idea for creating a low-cost microscope came to Manu Prakash in 2011 while he was at a field station in Thailand. He remarked that the station had a very expensive microscope but that everyone was afraid to use it because it was fragile and worth more than most people's salaries. He wanted to create a microscope that anyone could afford and that would be versatile and sturdy enough to work in field conditions. He developed the first prototype in 2014. Following the first generation of simple Foldscopes, twelve medical diagnostic Foldscope variants are being developed, each designed to aid the identification of a particular disease-causing organism. Each unit costs less than one US dollar to build, with estimates varying from 50 cents to 97 cents.In October 2015, India's Department of Biotechnology announced a program to make Foldscopes available across India at 80 approved colleges and programs. It will be used as a teaching tool for students in biology, chemistry and physics. After the pilot program, the Department hopes to work with Prakash to develop more low-cost science tools. Foldscope sets will also be produced and tested in Kenya and Uganda.But Prakash is most excited about amateurs just using the Foldscope to look at the world around them. “The biggest thing we’re trying to do is to make people curious,” he says. “Our ambition is that every kid should be able to carry a microscope in their pocket.” To make that happen, Prakash is now courting larger organizations that can take over the manufacturing and distribution. And he is convinced that once the scopes get in the hands of users, the rest will be easy.His Prakash lab is focused on innovative and easy to access products for all.Here is a picture of he and his lab membersSource:Stanford scientist Manu Prakash makes water based computer - Times of IndiaManu Prakash: A 50-cent microscope that folds like origamiStanford scientist Manu Prakash makes water based computer - Times of IndiaStanford engineers build a water-droplet based computer that runs like clockwork",0 followers,Shivam Rastogi,523,0,0,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-of-the-greatest-discoveries-inventions-made-by-Indians-in-the-last-200-years

GREEN LIVING – STREETS MADE OF PLASTICLike many countries, India grapples with an excess of plastic waste. Chemistry professor Rajagopalan Vasudevan devised a way to transform common plastic litter into a substitute for bitumen — the main ingredient in asphalt used for road construction. Known as the “Plastic Man,” Vasudevan’s ingenious invention has already paved 3,000 miles (5,000 kilometers) of plastic thoroughfares in at least 11 Indian states.​Streets of plastic.

Most students do not have proper desks, making learning more difficult -contributing to poor eyesight and posture. Marketing company DDB India and the nonprofit Aarambh came up with a creative solution called Help Desk. Made from discarded carton, the cardboard desk doubles as a brief-case like school bag and costs only 20 rupees to produce. The Help Desks are making significant difference in student’s lives and are easy to export to other countries in need.​The multi-purpose recyclable desk.3. SPEECH AND LANGUAGE – BREATHING TRANSLATES TO SPOKEN COMMUNICATIONAt the age of 16, Arsh Shah Dilbagi came up with a revolutionary invention that has the potential to change the lives of people with developmental disabilities and speech impairments. TALK is an AAC – augmentative and alternative communication device - that converts breaths into synthesized sentences or speak-out commands and phrases. His patent-pending technology got the attention of the world - Dilbagi was a finalist at the Google 2014 Science Fair and the portable invention will hopefully be on the market in the near future.​Young Dilbagi with his TALK invention.4.

This is an algorithmic view of a computer, free from pesky implementation concerns like mapping to digital logic etc.Computers have this notion of state. State is a fairly abstract notion, but it basically boils down to what the computer is doing at a specific moment. Think of it as a number, stored in the CPU.A Turing machine consists of 3 elements:* The tape : a functionally infinite memory, made up of a linear arrangement of cells containing a value.Turing Machine [ http://www2.lv.psu.edu/ojj/courses/cmpsc-122/problems/tur-machine.html ]During execution, the Turing machine will start at one location on tape. This is state n. It will read an instruction from the program and execute it, writing to tape and modifying its internal state.For example, an instruction might be:This is the basis for computing: a machine that can modify its state based on a set of instructions. This is implementation agnostic: it can be built using anything from gears to tiny structures on a silicon die. The beautiful thing about these machines is that given infinite time and memory, every Turing machine can do anything else a Turing machine can: it is truly universal.So how do we map this to hardware ?In the 1950’s, a man named John Von Neumann created what is called the “Von Neumann” architecture. It is one way to organize various components of a computer, and it’s what modern computers (mostly) use to this day.image: wikipediaWe see some similarities with the Turing machine: the tape is now the “Memory Unit”. It can also be thought of a linear arrangement of cells. These cells will now be referred to as “memory locations”. Each memory location is given a memory address, telling the memory unit which memory location it should access.We still have a control unit, which modifies the state of the machine based on a set of instructions. It does so mostly through the Arithmetic/logic unit (ALU).The program is now contained within the memory itself: the control unit fetches an instruction at location n, executes the instruction, and assuming it doesn’t branch or jump, it then continues to location n+1. The instruction can also tell the processor to jump to any arbitrary location in memory.The processor can communicate with the outside via I/O, which is either done using dedicated I/O ports or through memory-mapped I/O ports.So how does the processor actually work? What do the control units and ALU actually do?A simple educational architecture I quite like is the SAP-1, which was created by Paul Malvino for his book “digital computer electronics”.image: SAP-1 Architecture [ https://deeprajbhujel.blogspot.com/2015/12/sap-1-architecture.html ]The SAP-1 architecture revolves around a central bus (the W bus). Every component communicates through this bus.Let’s look at the various components:* The Program Counter (PC): this is a register (a small storage element) containing the address of the currently executing instruction.There’s also the control sequencer: Ill expand on that in a minute.All of the defined components above are “dumb” logic: they’re simple circuitry, taking in a few commands via wires and responding to them. But executing an instruction is a bit more involved than that.You’ll notice in the diagram a few wires sticking out of the components, labelled with names such as “CLK” or “E(x)”. These are all control signals. These components do exactly what they are told, and there isn’t necessarily a clear mapping between a binary instruction and clearing the instruction register for example, or incrementing the PC.That job falls onto the control sequencer. The control sequencer handles all the busywork of actually executing the instruction: it figures out what the instruction actually does then pulls these control signals up and down to ensure the “dumb” components do the expected work. For example, if the processor wants to read an address, the Control s...","5,650 followers",Dan Lenski,1.9K,1.4K,9.4M,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-of-the-greatest-discoveries-inventions-made-by-Indians-in-the-last-200-years

Even after helping people and opening up to them, they would talk so rudely to me the next day as they though we were strangers and i am a complete dick head unworthy of any kind of interaction.I couldn’t understand. I just opened up to you with full heart and we were friends . I went out of my way to help you . Why are you doing this to me?And this kept on going with literally everyone i met.People were betraying me, and were talking behind by back.I once even got bullied and beaten up by a guy in college while those friends just stood and watch.What is happening????Everyone seemed to be an asshole in my college.I even hated my college and they just won’t stop taking tests.I asked myself “Why am i asked to work hard ? i have already proven to the world that i am intelligent by entering one of the best colleges in the country”.I was at the bottom of the class.

My conclusion:NOTHING.At least in-universe.A “very special hologram,” Vic Fontaine (left) joined DS9 late in the series, entertaining and giving sage romantic advice as needed. Perhaps Vic’s finest moments came in the episode “It’s Only A Paper Moon,” when Vic helped a despondent Nog (right) come to terms with losing a leg in battle, an episode ranked as one of DS9’s best.It can’t be a question of memory space or computing power, after all, we once saw an entire ship of holograms (“Flesh and Blood,” Parts I and II) and they were doing just fine.The Voyager Doctor created a wife and family for himself, and it seems likely his three other family members shared a lot of the sophistication of his own program because, you know, the Doc wouldn’t have settled for anything less. Zero impact on the ship’s memory.And all this, years after the TNG episode “Elementary, Dear Data,” in which computer of the Enterprise-D created the sentient hologram Moriarty (Daniel Davis), Sherlock Holmes’ arch-enemy, after Geordie had instructed it to create an adversary that could “defeat Data” (not “defeat Sherlock Holmes”, the character whom Data was playing in the program.)In a follow-on episode, “Ship In A Bottle,” Moriarty later introduced a second hologram, his equally complex lady friend, the delightful Countess Regina Batholomew (Stephanie Beacham), and there was, again, no mention of any impacts on the ship’s computing capacity or memory space. Moriarty exercised a dangerous level of control over the Enterprise, but despite originally being programmed as a criminal, proved to have grown beyond his programming; he was quite reasonable, although determined to secure a life outside of the holodeck for himself and the Countess.Because this was impossible at the time, both holograms had to be tricked by nested holoprograms - false worlds-within-worlds - into believing that they had been given permanent solidity with no need for holoemitters; they were given leave, so they thought, to take an Enterprise shuttlecraft and depart the ship to explore the galaxy with the blessings of the crew.The reality was that their programs had been transferred seamlessly into a holo-environment tailored to their needs, and running inside a futuristic device the size of a shoebox, capable of essentially doing whatever the ship’s holodeck could do. Picard had his team fill the holo-shoebox with enough complexity to allow them to realise their impossible dreams - something that not even Andy Williams ever got to do.The hologram James Moriarty (Daniel Davis), from TNG, was, with apologies to a lady named Minuet, the most sophisticated hologram to have been created in a Starfleet holodeck prior to Voyager’s caustic EMH, the Doctor or “Doc”.Clearly, in-universe technology should offer no impediment to implementing multiple holographic personnel to serve aboard Starfleet vessels equipped with suitable holo-emitters.However, there are out-of-universe reasons why the writers have not rushed to create a lot of holographic persons.I don’t necessarily agree, and synthetic personalities have been used successfully throughout science fiction, whetherWilliam (Samuel Anderson, left), a hologram in the Netflix series “Another Life,” was designed to assist the captain and crew of an Earth spaceship. William becomes an integral part of the story, thanks in part to his emotional interactions with his flesh-and-blood companions, including Captain Nico Breckinridge (Katee Sackhoff, right), with whom he falls in love.As Voyager’s Doctor has shown us, virtually any danger that can threaten humans can also be made to threaten holograms. They have capabilities, but also limitations.Doc’s program could be altered, resulting in catastrophic behavioural changes (like mutilating the odd ex-Borg drone while singing “O My Darling Clementine” in the two-part episode “Equinox”);Anything that threatens Voyager’s computer also threatens Doc with destruction, particularly the dreaded “de-compiling”;The required holo-emitters could be destroyed or taken off line;A plot device to give the hologram more mobility (eg., the portable emitter device) can be stolen or - well, let’s go with stolen, I can’t bear to contemplate worse things happening to it;The hologram can be programmed to experience pain, the symptoms of illness, etc., whether for good reasons (eg., improve bedside manner through developing empathy) or nefarious ones (eg., torture.)And something that the SF series Red Dwarf explored that Star Trek has not is the difference between “soft light” and “hard light” holograms.Arnold Rimmer of Red Dwarf was a holographic version of a not-terribly-popular, human crew member, now a not-terribly-missed deceased crew member; the holographic version of Rimmer had an H on his forehead to stand for hologram, although I don’t know why that was actually necessary. Initially a soft-light hologram, his role expanded when a technical breakthrough allowed him to become a hard-light hologram.A “soft light” hologram is the kind we have today, made entirely of projected light and unable to interact with the real-world physical environment.A “hard light” hologram is the kind who can interact with the physical world, for example picking up medical tricorders, scrubbing deuterium tanks, slapping people on the face with large fish, having sex, etc.Could Star Trek make use of this distinction? Of course, or the writers aren’t earning their pay. Voyager’s Doctor was originally restricted to Sick Bay and the holodeck until the writers gave him his mobile emitter; but they could have granted him at least soft-light access to most of the ship at once with simple modifications to existing lighting systems (vs. installing the far more complex and energy-intensive full holo-emitters). At least he could diagnose and instruct; but at times, whatever he was carrying would fall to the deck because he had just walked into an area on which the holo-emitters were malfunctioning, reducing him to the impotence of a soft-light image.There could be a component to the holo-emitter that provides the image with the hard-light capability, a kind of holo-force field generator. In a show heavy with holographic characters, the term would end up used so much that it would join the “Heisenberg compensator” and “inertial dampeners” as staples of Starfleet’s technical vocabulary.Whatever writers want to do, they can and will make it work. I do not believe there would be any plausible impediment to providing a lot more holographic persons to back up the human ones, particularly in emergency situations.And they don’t all have to be doctors. Some could be commando fighters, like the Military Assault Command Operations (MACO) troops who accompanied Enterprise NX-01 in The Xindi period. What would have happened to USS Prometheus of 60 MACOs had appeared suddenly on the ship just as 27 Romulans beamed aboard - would the entire human crew have been killed? I think not.Others could be ship’s counselors, like DS9’s entertainer-cum-life coach, singer Vic Fontaine. Vic was a timely addition to the DS9 community, running a mellow Las Vegas nightclub that served as a retreat to stressed-out personnel during the Dominion War. And yet despite being a hologram, he displayed the savvy and wisdom of a human. Remember him coaching Odo in the ways of winning the heart of Major Kira Nerys? And what I consider one of the best-ever DS9 episodes, “It’s Only a Paper Moon,” when Vic’s compassion rehabilitated Ensign Nog who had sunk into deep despondency after losing a leg in the war?Some could even be CGI characters representing (or even created by) non-humanoid races. Their holographic nature could do away with the need for tedious housekeeping requirements for environment, atmosphere, food, etc. Perhaps the hologram(s) could be a test, or a practice, to allow a group of humans to come to know a very different race of aliens and determine whether humans could get along with them on extended missions (or at all.)The comedic possibilities are obvious, as is a more general observation: AI is looming in our near future, and Star Trek can and should be a vehicle for exploring the potential problems and solutions, in this case by exploring a bit of inner space - the hologram. That is the opportunity Star Trek has seized since the beginning: to make a difference. I believe there are more holographic characters on the way.",55 followers,John Young,510,3.6K,19.7M,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-of-the-greatest-discoveries-inventions-made-by-Indians-in-the-last-200-years
