The project recently received the in priciple approval from the Indian government. LIGO-India is planned as a collaborative project between a consortium of Indian research institutions and the LIGO Laboratory in the USA, along with its international partners Australia, Germany and the UK.This observatory is planned in Hingoli district of Maharashtra, India.What is LIGO India?The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) project operates three gravitational-wave (GW) detectors. Two are at Hanford in the state of Washington, north-western USA, and one is at Livingston in Louisiana, south-eastern USA. Currently these observatories are being upgraded to their advanced configurations (called Advanced LIGO). The proposed LIGO-India project aims to move one Advanced LIGO detector from Hanford to India. LIGO-India project is envisaged as an international collaboration between the LIGO Laboratory and three lead institutions in the IndIGO consortium: Institute of Plasma Research (IPR) Gandhinagar, Inter University Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics (IUCAA), Pune and Raja Ramanna Centre for Advanced Technology (RRCAT), Indore. LIGO lab would provide the complete design and all the key detector components. Indian scientists would provide the infrastructure to install the detector at a suitable site in India and would be responsible for commissioning it. The proposed observatory would be operated jointly by IndIGO and the LIGO-Lab and would form a single network along with the LIGO detectors in USA and Virgo in Italy.Scientific benefits:The scientific benefits of LIGO-India are enormous. Adding a new detector to the existing network will increase the expected event rates, and will boost the detection confidence of new sources (by increasing the sensitivity, sky coverage and duty cycle of the network). But the dramatic improvement from LIGO-India would come in the ability of localizing GW sources in the sky. Sky-location of the GW sources is computed by combining data from geographically separated detectors ('aperture synthesis'). Adding a new detector in India, geographically well separated from the existing LIGO-Virgo detector array, will dramatically improve the source-localization accuracies (5 to 10 times), thus enabling us to use GW observations as an excellent astronomical tool.Impact on Indian science, industry and education:Impact on Indian science:LIGO-India will provide similar opportunities to Indian industry.UPDATE 1:Three scientists from LIGO international has recently awarded Noble prize in physics. Indian scientists were also involved in this project. Prof. Sanjeev Dhurandar from IUCAA, Pune led that project.",241 followers,Sonali Kerketta,22.4K,0,0,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-of-the-lesser-known-and-mind-blowing-facts-about-India

Once they sense a nearing neighbor, the growing process halts, ensuring that light can penetrate the canopy and photosynthesis continue.Another possible explanation is that this is a defense mechanism against leaf-eating insects. The gaps mean bugs wouldn't be able to reach other trees, impeding their spread.The next time you're out walking through the forest, take a moment to look above you and you might be pleasantly surprised by what you find.Edit 1: Thanks Robert Taylor for the correction.Edit 2: Thank you all for your love, affection, and kind comments.","1,892 followers",Sarah Ameri,119K,151,2.9M,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-of-the-lesser-known-and-mind-blowing-facts-about-India

Most of us have been conditioned to think that the way to get someone to like us is by doing nice little favors for them, thereby demonstrating that we are a thoughtful and dependable person. Old Benji thought differently.Franklin once had a very powerful political rival who was hellbent on making his life miserable. Franklin knew that it would be beneficial to have this man on his side, but instead of groveling for his approval, he took a counter-intuitive approach. He knew his rival was in possession of a very rare and valuable book, and simply asked him to borrow it. After a few days, he returned it with a thank you note and, surprisingly, his rival became his friend.What Franklin tapped into is a well-known psychological principle known asIn the case of Franklin, his rival held the belief: “I do not like Benjamin Franklin.” Upon doing him the favor, however, he was forced to come to terms with another belief: “It’s a pain in the ass to do favors for other people, so I only do favors for people I like.” These two beliefs are in conflict, and since he cannot un-loan the book, he was forced to soften and eventually reverse his ill-will towards Franklin.The secret of the Benjamin Franklin effect is this:Now will you please hit that upvote button? ;)",UNKNOWN,Ariel,13.5K,0,0,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-of-the-lesser-known-and-mind-blowing-facts-about-India

That’s one heaping big American super-sized serving of retaliation!In addition to the heavily-hyped hypersonic missiles, Russia has also been working on a nuclear torpedo calledMost of America’s nuclear retaliatory power is inside our Ohio-class missile submarines. Fourteen subs, each carrying up to 192 nuclear warheads. That’s one heaping big American super-sized serving of retaliation!In addition to the heavily-hyped hypersonic missiles, Russia has also been working on a nuclear torpedo calledabove: Burevestnik nuclear ramjet-powered hypersonic cruise missile.above: Poseidon nuclear torpedo (artist’s rendering). Wow, that’s huge!Both of these research programs were direct responses to US progress in Anti-Ballistic Missiles (ABMs). America now has two different ABM systems that Russia knows have reliably made repeated kills in live tests. (success rate varies from 50% to over 90%. I know 50% doesn’t sound great. But that is for intercepting ICBMs while still in space, a huge technical challenge, and that missile is still in-development)The doctrine of Mutually-Assured Destruction (MAD) is still in-effect between the US and Russia, simply because it’s worked for 70 years. Both sides understand and agree that “if I attack you, you’ll still be able to retaliate and destroy me too. If both sides know that we both will always lose in a nuclear exchange, we won’t start one”.But that “be able to retaliate” part is critical. Even though we’ve agreed not to deploy large enough numbers of ABMs to defend against Russian attacks, that’s a political decision that could change quickly.The American ABMs are meant to stop nuclear terrorists and “rogue” nuclear powers like North Korea. But if our ABMs threatened to change the playing field so much that Russian ICBMs were no longer a deterrent, that could provoke Russia into a first strike attack before they were rendered helpless.Developing a complex new advanced weapon takes decades. But once it’s ready, if the US did a “race to the Moon” style push and threw a trillion dollars at the project, we could build thousands of ABMs and make Russia’s ICBMs obsolete in about a decade.If Russia couldn’t retaliate after a US first strike, there’d be nothing but our goodwill left to stop America from destroying them. An intolerable situation for any superpower!So that’s how I view these new Russian weapons: They aren’t an escalation, just a new delivery system. They will maintain balance between the superpowers. The US will be able to counter the growing threat of small nuclear attacks against us, involving one or a few incoming missiles. Russia will create some new weapons that work around America’s new defenses, MAD stays in-effect and we superpowers don’t destroy human civilization.One more detail I should mention: The two sides here, Russia and US-plus-NATO, are allowed by treaty to each have about 6,000 nuclear weapons. These new weapons won’t be adding more to that total. New weapons will replace older ones, which will then be destroyed and their nuclear material recycled. And the process is monitored by international observers, so no cheating.Maintaining these delicate balances of power keep the superpowers calm. Well, calmer anyway. MAD has worked for over 70 years. It’s a crazy doctrine that we basically fell into by accident. But it works, and we shouldn’t break it until we have a better one in-place.This has all happened before: In the early 1950s, the USSR did a study (top secret then, but now declassified and available online) on how to get their nuclear bombers past the new American air defenses being constructed, which were quite elaborate and sophisticated: Multiple layers of radar covering the entire continent, a nationwide computer control network, and manned interceptor jets plus nuclear-tipped surface-to-air missiles around the northern and coastal cities.above: Several Nike Hercules missiles coming at your bombers at Mach 3.5, each carrying a 20kt nuclear warhead, is going to give any bomber formation a very bad day. In my opinion, the Nike Hercules were the coolest-looking missiles ever built. :)The Soviet study concluded that their air forces could not penetrate these defenses in enough numbers to successfully carry out an attack. So they looked for a new way to deliver nukes, and that’s exactly how ICBMs and Sputnik came to be. It scared the heck out of America at first, but we had our own ICBMs within a few years.above: Soviet R-7 ICBM. An invention that can truly be said to have “changed the world”.edit: Changed first pic, which was miscaptioned by the source and actually the wrong missile.

43,"Probably not in the immediate near future. but in 50 ~100 years it’s very possible. I remember in early 1980s when China just opened up(and still extremely poor), Reagan government sent someone to China to evaluate the Chinese education system(because Ronald Reagan wanted to know if the Chinese can be a strong ally against the Russians). The result surprised everyone. The average chinese middle school students outperforms american middle school students in almost all science field, especially in math.

Chinese are also leading in the amount of intellectual property patents for design and industrial engineering and again going ahead of US. More than 60% of the papers written in steel industry belong to Chinese research engineers.They have huge technological companies which can go one on one with their equivalent Us ones . For example like Alibaba (Amazon), Baidu (Google), Xiaomi (Apple), Tucent(Facebook), Did Chuxing (Uber),Youku(youtube and Netflix), QQ(Spotify) etc. The list goes on. These companies are financially as strong or sometimes stronger than their American counterparts. Having access to such a large population helps. That the government helps by restricting competition from outside definitely helps a lot.This domination does not end just in technological sector. Siemens and Alsthom had to merge in September this year (2017) to counter CRRC in the high speed rail building industry. This merger will bring a 18billion$ competitor to CRRC which is having an annual revenue of 35billion$. They are very active in infrastructure projects in Africa where the western world is not so involved.The government is stable and enforcing technological advancement with authority (of course it is difficult to enforce such things so hard in democratic countries). Intelligent Steel making , Indistry 4.0 , Driverless Electric buses (running in Taiyuan), Electric Taxis all are examples of Government backed advances. Sometimes experiments fail like the straddling bus in Qinhuangdao. But then such steps help technological advancement.So I would not say that Chinese are the most technologically advanced country yet.

BTW look around in your shirt chances are it is made in China.Well, Chances if you live in North America, somewhere along the way you will pick up take out of Chinese food also.The point I am making: Brute force is out to be called superpower, that was barbarian, uncivilized, mutually not beneficial, colonies did not stay forever, Genghis Khan and Kubla Khan bit the dust, and so did Alexander the Great. I believe this soft power and invisible chains are going to last for thousands of years.Chinese historically do not believe in wasting too much Gun Powder, even though they invented it, and they still use it to celebrate something good, even in the early morning in firecrackers.They also wrote a book on “ Art of War” this is an ancient book, but they are brilliant, the central theme of that book is: win the war without the war. Rest assured, and they have already have won the battle, the only thing people are still in Comatose, they do not realize it. I won’t be around, but these chains are going to go away anytime soon.When rest of the world (well most of it) is sinking in red ink, anyone with a deep pocket is the boss. Like it or not. Spend, and God will send: the motto in the west will be changed: Spend and China will mortgage. ( do not believe me: check out how many empty steel containers are in surplus, they come full and empty are sold here)Whatever is left of the world without red ink, they are sinking in ‘ red blood” who supplies arms to keep them killing each other. He is the boss. Like it for not.Whatever further left of the world, they are picking in their juices, of corruption, filth, low productivity, no or trickle law and order, big talk no action, huge speeches but in the end nothing achieved, other than their substantial Swiss accounts.Now China has got complete control, of this equation from one end to the other.Also please keep in mind you are dealing with one of most hard-working, disciplined and super saver race on the earth, who wrote a book of frugal living.Please go to China you will see one very strange looking animal on the significant buildings this animal is more or less national symbol, it is called Pixiu, this animal is considered very powerful, It has mouth but no anus, so it just swallows things inside without passing out, it is unofficial national symbol( I believe) to accumulate wealth from all over without losing it.The author is very fascinated with their wealth accumulating mindset, most of Chinese are big savers, they like to sell but not by much. That is why empty containers are sold here, for pennies on dollars.The author has also taken lots of pictures of this animal: here is one for your visual pleasurePlease: Say Hello to your new Pixiu, in fact, this unique animal will be new boss, (superpower) because He has the dough and power to shut down the world now, if it does not now stay tuned, He is coming to your town soon, welcome Him if you like or not.In my view: China/Chinese accurate to their writing: Art of War,( winning the war without war)True to their mythological symbol, accumulating wealth from all directions, without losing a penny.True to their ancient wisdom of setting the Silk Road, thousands year ago, to accumulate wealth, now they modified the Silk road it is extended to go around the globe I believe they are spending about one billion dollars a day on infrastructures, please go to Shanghai and check out the fastest train in the world, I have 431 Km/hours, where rest of the world tried but failed ( Well it is a myth: Chinese are not original, please think again) This Silk Road will very nice and may stay for another 6000 years, and not like the previous one who stayed only a few thousand years.Also, they are not building another The Great Wall of China or reinforcing the old one, and they do not feel the need, She is super confident that she is going to own most of the civilized world one way or the other. ( These are my thoughts, I may not like it, but she is the new boss with her super soft power,)Meanwhile : please get used to most popular Chinese color: Red and Golden Yellow, and say : Ding Ding Hoo, and not Mama hoo hoo, enough for now, my time to learn some more Mandarin words, oh, I have take my grandkids for Mandarin immersion enrollment also, classes are being filled very quickly.In short and sweet:Would the world take China as a 'Super Power' in the coming future?Once you visit China and travel, writing is on the walls: Crown princess or prince has arrived, and there is no turning back. This new boss will not be a warrior, very savvy businessman so far you take a full shipload of containers of the merchandise and pay the bills on time, and there will no problem in the world. This boss will have: tremendous soft power, to push a few buttons on the bank machines and change the fate of some countries without sending even one soldier or firing one shot. China is getting mega-rich by the minute, and they are sitting on such a tremendous wealth of industry knowledge. Patents, processes, and know-how that they could reproduce anything in the world. In my view the time is not far off, China will ask some countries to jump, and the answer will be: How high sir/madam?",0 followers,Peter Hong,1.2K,0,0,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-of-the-lesser-known-and-mind-blowing-facts-about-India

66,"Thanks for the A2A.I read through many of the answers and am surprised to see so many Indian Quorans defame their country. Whatever happened to national pride?India is a superpower theoretically. It has the intellectual capacity, the firepower, the human and natural resources, the strategic skills in combat and the will to destroy if it enters the arena of war.But India has a much greater warlike stance. It does not go to war unnecessarily. Based on the principles of ahimsa, it has a peaceful controlled attitude and minds its own business.

Whatever happened to national pride?India is a superpower theoretically.

It does not go to war unnecessarily. Based on the principles of ahimsa, it has a peaceful controlled attitude and minds its own business. At all times from Independence, the country has built up its reserves in the sheer numbers of its forces. Only China has a similar capability.India gained nuclear capabilities way back in 1974! Never once did India threaten to use this capability on anyone else. That in itself is the most sensible thing to do. At the time, I remember, other nuclear club members ran advertisements mocking India with a begging bowl and starving people. That was partly correct. However, the mere knowledge that a country was meant to be subdued and quiet had developed superpower capabilities could not be stomached so quickly, by other nuclear club members. At the time, nuclear capabilities defined ‘superpower’ status. It still does. The crooked metaphor is: the more you can kill, the more muscle you have! Wrong. India does not contribute to such a flagrant loss of lives. That alone makes it a superpower!India is a ‘soft superpower’, and it does not stockpile destructive materials within its borders or elsewhere. Yet it can call, manufacture and use any number of armaments at short notice. These capacities are stored in scientists' heads and vast databases for ‘instant’ recall.India can fire a space probe to the moon at 1/100th the cost of an American one! That means the country can produce 100 rockets for the price of 1 NASA rocket! Does anybody know what that means?The superpower capacity is calculated in theoretical knowledge rather than stockpile knowledge. A country cannot continue manufacturing weaponry that goes obsolete in a week. The call-up rate is disproportionate to the use ratio. The US needs to go to war with the slightest excuse. It is to use its obsolete weaponry and kick start the full production capabilities to upgrade to the latest. There are two ways this can be done. Theoretically or practically. Which one would you choose?Look at the global reach of the world's biggest businesses. Where do they get their human resources from? Good guess. India! Take out the Indians, andLong before aircraft came into existence, the ‘Every Indian thinks for the future.Every Superpower thinks of how they can lay waste to productive lands and people. IsImagine what a huge task it was to bringDid India steal from any other country?At the time India gained independence they could not manufacture an umbrella. Today they can manufacture just about anything. That is real Independence and resilience. 700 million people are fed, clothed and instructed every day. It's just a short distance away to change another 300 million to reach the billion mark. You do this by praising yourself and helping out- not by degrading yourself.Let us all think again when this question comes up. Just look out of the window and you will know who we are today.India is already a soft superpower.ThanksEdit 1:Edit 2:There's more coming. Watch this space!Edit3:I have removed any implied insult to any nation. The oblique answer is to look inwards at what creates Superpowers. If it is not always economically driven then it must be intellectually driven.",101 followers,Anthony Galli,813,298,5.7M,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-of-the-lesser-known-and-mind-blowing-facts-about-India
