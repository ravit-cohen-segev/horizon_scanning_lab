So they might be modeling the collisions of two galaxies - but they won’t be doing that by following the paths of individual stars…much less individual atoms. So their simulation is only approximate - and is sufficient to see some general trends - but not good enough to make precise predictions.",UNKNOWN,Jess H.

And, no, I am not a diehard Windows XP fan.Let’s see what you can learn about me from the screenshot…Now, you probably guessed I am using a computer that’s at least 10 years old. If you guessed that, you’d be wrong. Get ready to cringe again but much…much…harder this time….Yeah, you’re probably either feeling sick with pity or laughing like Darth Vader (wait, I don’t think he can laugh).Yes, I am using a Dell Inspiron 5100, originally released in 2003. I’m using a computer that’s freaking 14-years-old!Let’s go through the hardware, shall we…(further hardware details can be foundThe touch pad sometimes gets inaccurate readings so I will sometimes use a wired mouse. Also, it doesn’t support finger dragging to scroll so I need to click and drag the scroll bar every dang time I want to do anything.As I type this answer, there is a noticeable delay for the characters to appear.The fans are in constant motion. I listen to them 5–8 hours per day aside from my earbuds with music playing.The wifi at my house isn’t supposed to exist. My Mom objects to wifi so I study at the local college even though I don’t take classes there. I, however, try to always have some wifi network running at home. The phone I bought myself doesn’t have service and life would be miserable without it. Mom usually discovers my trick after a few months and then, it’s time to innovate a new avoidance of the terrible circumstances I face. I often study for 5–8 hours there without speaking a word to anyone. Just me, in the library, doing school. This is when I feel worthless socially. Passers by my chosen desk in the library giggle and point at my machine as they engage in private conversations with study partners (when they think I’m not looking) about the unfortunate soul stuck with using a 14-year-old computer for school every day.There is another half to the story. Without details, I’ll say that after nearly three months of arguing, I convinced my parents to get me a usable computer. Four days later my Mom broke the computer (because I stayed up too late on a Saturday night finishing an English paper and forgot to “turn it [the laptop] in”). I convinced her to take me to Costco on the way to another destination where I was given her credit card to ask for a replacement. I lied and told the clerk that I had broken the computer. Costco gave me what I believed to be a new replacement. However, within a few hours of opening the box (after arguing for permission), I discovered it was clearly used. The battery lasted a 3rd as long, worn screws on the bottom, and a dent. Four months later, the hard drive (SSD) fails and I revert back to using my 14-year-old machine. Now I have raised my middle finger to the entire situation as I sell SD cards on eBay until I have enough money to purchase a replacement without the involvement of my parents. Too bad I’ll be a senior equivalent by the time I finally get a usable machine compared to my peers who commonly received a new MacBook Air in 7th grade.Since we’re friends, I explained the situation to my friendMy parents are great. However, they can’t seem to understand the needs of a student in the 21st century. I still struggle to understand what they’re thinking when they make technology such a huge issue. They also have “old school” values and believe in harsh punishments for violations which most parents would consider trivial. As a 17-year-old, I find myself discovering new flaws with my parents every day and hope to not repeat their mistakes while embracing the valuable information and experience they can offer. They somehow expect me to deal with this constant sabotage and still get A’s and B’s in my classes. During the weeks with a reliable internet connection and a good computer, I received all A’s and B’s. Without it, work doesn’t get done, deadlines are missed, and F’s are given. It tends to downplay my grade nearly 20% lower than it should be. I’ve tried explaining to my teachers but they trust the parental authority more and so, life goes on.P.S. I’ve had to type this answer twice because the wifi was turned off. Fortunately, I saved myself a third time because I copied before changes were lost and pasted when I managed to turn on the hotspot again. As soon as I get $50, I’m purchasing a Vocore v2.0, a tiny wifi router which will provide the internet access I need and help me get by undetected. I’ve also tried reasoning with my parents though this has proved totally impossible.Want to learn more about Windows XP?

7,"It was just before Presidents’ Day in 1992. I was 6 months pregnant with my second child, and my father was dying. He had congestive heart failure, caused by cardiomyopathy (an enlarged heart), something which we discovered he had had from birth, but which went undiagnosed until his mid-40s when he had his first heart attack. (Long story, but his birth mother had had rheumatic fever while pregnant with him, and it had affected his heart in utero.

He had congestive heart failure, caused by cardiomyopathy (an enlarged heart), something which we discovered he had had from birth, but which went undiagnosed until his mid-40s when he had his first heart attack. (Long story, but his birth mother had had rheumatic fever while pregnant with him, and it had affected his heart in utero. Medical care wasn’t as good in 1927.)I had an almost 5 year old son who adored my dad. The two were best buddies. If my son couldn’t be with me, his next favorite person to be with was his grandfather.My dad started to go downhill in December of the previous year. He started to lose his voice, and he thought there might be a type of bug going around, so it didn’t seem to be a big deal at first. We found out that the reason for the loss of his voice is that his heart had become so enlarged that it was pressing on something (a nerve, if I remember correctly) and it had basically paralyzed a vocal cord.He was occasionally in and out of the hospital from the beginning of 1992. On this day in February, I got a frantic call from my mom. She told me that my dad had been taken in by ambulance and that the hospital staff was hoping to keep him alive until we got there so that we could say good-bye (she didn’t drive).I called my husband who informed me that it was tax season and that, of course, he couldn’t come home to take care of our son. The closest other people who I could think of were my in-laws, so I called them, only to be told by my mother-in-law that there was a big sale at a local department store and that they were going shopping, but that they’d be glad to take care of my son after they returned home in several hours. I remember saying, “No, thanks, he’ll be dead by then.”I called my mom, and told her to have my uncle drive her to the hospital and that I’d get there as soon as I could. My usual baby-sitter was still in school and wouldn’t be out for a couple of hours yet. I was racking my brain trying to think of someone I could get on such short notice.Shortly after that, I received a call from my aunt, who was undergoing chemotherapy. “Bring him over,” she said. “I’ve got lots of toys and books from watching my grandkids to keep him entertained,” said this woman who would die herself several months later.Just before my son and I left, the phone rang yet again. It was my father-in-law, who had apparently (for once in his life) stood up to his wife. He told me to bring over my son. “No, thanks,” I said. “My aunt, the one who’s going through chemo - you remember her? - is going to watch him.”That was the angriest I’ve ever been with anyone, I think. Here’s someone who has a very close family member dying, but shopping is more important!? Please!Remarkably, my dad pulled through that event. He died 18–1/2 hours after my daughter was born in May. They never got to meet, but I like to think that she has an extra-special guardian angel.",140 followers,Mary Windstein,3K,0,0,https://www.quora.com/If-you-coded-a-game-with-all-the-laws-of-physics-could-that-then-be-used-to-test-real-problems-we-have-in-physics

He has never worked a steady job for moreTW: MolestationEdited for clarity on the ages of the participants.A couple of years after the offense, my 13-year-old daughter (now 21) confessed that her then 32-year-old uncle caressed her breasts in the basement one day when we were visiting my in-laws. She had just turned 11 at the time of the incident. She was terrified and paralyzed. He told her that she couldn’t tell anyone or else he could go to jail. She told no one at the time. A little bit of background: my brother-in-law lives in his parents basement still today and he is now 42 years old. He has never worked a steady job for more than a few months. He had one girlfriend many years ago and that girlfriend ended up marrying his best friend. He’s a very creepy guy. At that point, however, we had thought of him as a lovable uncle. When my daughter confided this to me, about two years after the incident, it was because he was flying out to visit us for a week. She was petrified and finally told me about the incident. My brother-in-law was already in the air on his way for his visit. I hit the roof. My husband wanted to shove it under the rug. Turns out he has a severe conflict avoidance problem. My husband had always talked about how he would defend his family to the death, we thought of him as a great protector. This was the first of many incidents that demonstrated otherwise. My in-laws accused my daughter of lying and accused me of making a mountain out of a mole hill. My husband was paralyzed and couldn’t deal with it. I became a mama bear and told my husband in no uncertain terms that BIL was not permitted in my house or near any of my children ever again. And my mother-in-law and father-in-law were also not welcome either until they apologized to their granddaughter for their accusations. My daughter was not known for telling stories, certainly not stories that would hurt someone. My daughter was devastated by how her father and her grandparents reacted and she wished so much that she had never said anything. Exactly the wrong message that you want to give a young girl in this situation.Then we remembered that same uncle back when he was 21, had been trying to make the moves on my then 14-year-old daughter, another daughter, on our wedding weekend. We didn’t take that as seriously because the age difference was so much less and the 21-year-old uncle was pretty backwards. We did have a talk with him and told them that it needed to never happen again. But with this second incident, oh hell to the no! Over the years my mother-in-law has attempted to bring us to together with BIL for events as though nothing ever happened! My husband always refused to deal with the situation so it was up to me to deal with his paralysis and lack of strength and his crazy family and I certainly am not winning any popularity contests with his family. To me it’s a no brainer that when your brother molests your daughter, you rise up and you deal with it. I wish I had pressed charges at the time, I didn’t have the courage to go against the entire family. Felt like I was in the twilight zone when I had to keep re-asserting that he was no longer welcome in our presence. A few years ago, my very brave daughter sat down with her grandparents and very clearly articulated how much they hurt her by dismissing the incident and calling her a liar. She also talked to them about their constant comments on her weight and her body and eating too much. My in-laws, especially my father-in-law, feels that it is his right and duty to comment about the size and shape of every woman within his vantage point. She also talked to them about their constant comments on her weight and her body and her food choices. He has said some horrible and traumatizing things to me and to all four of my daughters. After this courageous and difficult conversation, she sort of kinda not really got an almost kind of maybe halfhearted apology. Not.Recently, my husband left me for another woman in a very devastating way. She was a friend and an employee. He sent me a text message that he was going to “try out love” with this woman that he had known for 115 days. He told me he hadn’t loved me for the last 10 years. Looking back on it, I maybe should’ve seen the signs but I loved him very much and I didn’t want to see those signs. I’m utterly devastated by the break up of my family. I feel like his family in its totality has brought nothing but trouble over the years to me and my daughters. It’s astonishing how pathetic, uncaring, and weak people can be when it truly matters. My husband has now taught my daughters that you commit only when it’s convenient and you love only when it’s convenient. And by the way, my father-in-law is still commenting on my daughters’ food habits.I now realize that my husband shares the utter immorality and spinelessness of his brother and parents. When he left me, he told me I was too strong for him. I told him someone had to be the man in the family.Please no comments on the sexism of my previous statement, I mean that to be as insulting as it sounds. Plus, I didn’t really say that, I just thought it. I would never say something that cruel. But it’s true.My daughter is the strongest person I know, no thanks to her father. She is courageous, confident, loving, empathetic, and takes no bullshit from any person. She sings at various venues throughout New York City and is currently learning how to produce her own music. I still shake with rage when I think about her having to endure that experience and the subsequent fall out.

Honestly, I didnt give two shits about her opinion of me. What angered me was how it made her daughter feel.As we got ready to go out to eat, my soon to be wife was in the bathroom with her mother doing hair and makeup etc. I walked down the hall to ask my fiancee something, but I stopped when I overheard her mother say…“I think you should just tell him that you've changed your mind and you aren't ready to get married yet. “(This whole exchange made me love and respect my girl even more than I already did) Wife: “But that isn't true, I am ready to get married. I love him and I'm GOING to marry him.”Mom… “I think you are making a huge mistake marrying him. Your father agrees with me. ”My wife… “Good thing I am in charge of my own life then. You and dad haven’t even given him a chance, so your opinion is ridiculous. I'm embarrassed for you. You harping on me about this is just wrong, mother. It is stressing me out. If you don't stop this, we will go stay at someone else's house for the next few days.” (We had moved 550 miles away but opted to have our wedding in her home town, near her family and friends)Mom replied…”Fine then! I will drop it.” Then she stomped out of the bathroom and ran right into me...leaning against the wall just outside of the doorway. I didn't say a word. She knew I heard the entire exchange.On schedule, I proudly married my beautiful young bride on March 4th, 1989. She was 20, and I was nearly 23. In our wedding pix, in every single photo that included her mother, she had the most sour and bitter expression on her face that one could imagine. If you were looking at a photo of a line of our family and friends, you'd see big smile, big smile, big smile, bitter/sour/bitch face, big smile, big smile etc.While perusing the pix later, I asked my wife what I did that made her parents hate me.She said that her mom thinks my mom, whom they had met a couple weeks before the bathroom show, was snobby. That was her mom's…excuse…at the time. My mom was indeed a bit snobby. However, she loved my wife and always treated her like gold.My mom did not care for my new in-laws because during dinner, the night they all met for the first time, my mother saw her mother roll her eyes at her husband every time I said something.It seriously pissed off my mom to see that woman treat me that disrespectfully for no valid reason, behind my back. Can’t say I blame her for disliking the old bitch.3 yrs later, around the time that our healthy and beautiful boy/girl twins were born, her mother finally confessed that the real reason she initially set out to try and talk her daughter out of marrying me was because we had moved 3 states away for a great job I got. However, when she held those grandbabies, she decided that maybe I wasn't so bad of a feller after all.",22 followers,Jeff Cox,2.1K,794,2.9M,https://www.quora.com/What-does-your-computer-desktop-say-about-you

Water got into the DJ's computer and the music stopped.I cannot find a word to describe how I felt at that moment. If it were up to me, I would have kicked his ass out but I did not want to make a scene. Our friends who lived nearby went and got their blue tooth speakers to save the party.

I took the girls to school the next morning and went out to the in-laws house. I only got to speak to the mother-in-law because father-in-law was still sleeping. I told her that I thought it was ridiculous for him to yell at my daughter like that. She just kept saying she was sorry I felt that way. I told her that the youngest one was cowering on the floor of the truck to keep from being yelled at. She also said that the only grandkids he cared about was the two oldest ones. She said that was the truth. Really! Out of 11 grandkids he only loves 2! I was getting really ticked off. I told her that the kids had just lost a set of grandparents and they were the only ones left. She didn't care. I told her that I would find a place to move the horse and we would never step on their property again. She told me that that would be okay! So that's what happened.

But…their son ruined everything and left me with 6 kids and nothing.They allowed us to stay at their house , constantly asking when we would be leaving. I cried every night while trying to figure out what to do. I was trying to sell the house when the pipes froze and burst, cancelling the sale. I filed a claim and fought to prove I wasn’t negligent- I won when it was found the oil gauge for the heat was broken. I won the claim and used that money as cash inventive to any buyer. I sold the house and made a small amount of profit.My plan was to live at my in laws for a year until my ex completed rehab and would be able to work and help support us. (He ended up being gone over 18 months). But I wanted to keep that money on the bank so we could save and have a shot at getting back on our feet.They made my life a living hell. Constantly calling to tell me to clean, and when would I be out. They had their other sons spy on the house, one caused a confrontation with me at the gym. They were mad at ME, not their precious baby boy. They said I must have contributed to him going down that path.It was so bad that within a couple months I literally packed what little we had and moved me and my kids to a small 2 bedroom apartment. I used every single penny I had saved to pay for one year up front, bc no one would sign a lease with me. A single mom of 6 kids with no job.

And hide your alcohol behind the cleaners under the kitchen sink?” “Well yes but I don’t see what…” I then asked each of my wife’s sisters if they were on anti depressants, both of which replied in the affirmative.So I reminded my wife’s mom that while I was married to one person at the table who was getting treatment for BPD, there were 3 generations of family members who all had the same diagnosis.People honestly want to blame others even for things that are obviously not their fault.So glad I don’t have to deal with those people any more.

He was not quite “vegetative,” but not the opposite either.During this time, his oldest son had moved to New Zealand. Also during this time, his other kids (also adult) were not really around much, even though they lived nearby.I was pretty much on my own, advocating for continued care as others gave up. Throughout, the kid in NZ would email me that I should “let him go,” and that “this Isn’t the kind of life he’d want,” etc.But sitting with him every day, I saw progress and maintained hope that he could recover enough to at least do some of the things he liked, like visiting with friends and devouring books on tape. The emails weighed heavily on me, but I persisted.I’m gonna skip almost 2 years ahead now, and tell you that my husband did get much better. He was never really lucid again, but he came home and was able to talk and visit with friends and family. He was eventually able to walk from one end of the house to the other with a walker and me behind with a gait belt, but he never could eat again. On Halloween, I cheated by melting Reese cups (his favorite!)in my fingers and wiping it on his tongue, and on my birthday, I was able to get him out to a bar I liked where he laughed with new friends and I dropped a bit of whiskey sour out of a straw into his mouth. During the day, I played books on tape for him, especially Shakespeare (he was a great scholar of Shakespeare, even wrote a couple of books). I even got him to Son’s wedding in a park on a rainy fall day. No, it was not his best life, but it was at least approaching a life he could recognize.Eventually, the son moved back and into a house just a few doors down from us. He would occasionally fill in to sit with his dad so that I could take our daughter to a swim meet or a school function.Things seemed to be going great when my husband fell ill again. Lethargy and diapers filled with dark brown Hershey’s syrup looking goo. The nurse who came twice a week thought it would pass and when she couldn’t get a drop of blood out of a fingertip and the device she used to measure his blood clotting factor ( he was on Coumadin)gave alarming results, she just banged it a few times on the bed rail and complained that it was broken.But the following week, after encountering the same problems and noticing that his lips and the tip of his nose were white, she told me to take him to the hospital.At the hospital, the doctors quickly found out that he was bleeding to death internally from an ulcer. His INR was 11 (normal for him was like a 2–3). That’s the number the at home nurse had been seeing but dismissing. As a result, I had overdosed him with the blood thinner.Scarier yet, every prick created an extreme blood river flowing from it. He was dying but they kept working on him, eventually discovering that his blood volume was about 75% depleted. They did not think he could survive. One of the doctors looked at his numbers and simply said to me, “That level just isn’t compatible with life.”I’m gonna jump ahead again.He survived. 7 1/2 pints of blood later, he was once again in ICU on a respirator. But he never regained consciousness again. His eyes would open, but he had no awareness.It seemed pretty clear after just a few days that this time was different. He was eventually moved back to the rehab floor of the hospital where he had spent some months during his recovery.During this time, I read to him and left books for others to read to him and I brought in a CD player and his favorite music (Bob Dylan and Jefferson Starship). I put it on repeat and let it play even when I left.Here’s where the ex wife comes in:People seemed to understand that this was the end. Friends and family who had offered no help or visits throughout the last couple of years started to come in. She was one of them.I came in as I always did after getting my daughter off the school bus. First thing I noticed was that the music was off. Then I noticed the player was gone with his Dylan cd inside. I asked around and no one knew where it was, so I assumed it had been stolen.A female janitor I had befriended said she thought she saw a dark-haired lady leave with it. Ugh! The son’s mom! I called him and he told me yes, she recognized it as hers and had taken it home to “fix” it. I was livid! “Tell her to bring it back!” I demanded. But she never did. She still has it. And the Dylan cd too. 😡This last episode had started in early December, but by February, the palliative care team had started asking around about me. Social workers would occasionally pop in and tell me they wanted to meet.Readers, I hid! I avoided them at all costs!Until the day the hospital administrator accompanied me to a bright boardroom in a hidden corner behind the nurses office.It was like an intervention. I sat stunned as a group of doctors, therapists and social workers went around the table one by one, telling me it was over. “His body has given up,” one said. “His organs are failing and his Skin is breaking down…” Finally, the administrator said, “It’s just not moral or ethical to continue treatment anymore.”They were all right, of course.I spent a few days making calls to friends and family before making the agonizing decision to discontinue life support but only after assurance he would not feel pain. I also was given the choice to bring him home to die or to let him stay where he was. I chose the latter because I had grown to love the nurses who had taken such good care of him and I trusted them.And so it began. I called my daughter off from school on a Tuesday morning and we gathered with the rest of the family around his bed.Just to be clear, this decision was made with the input and blessings of all in attendance.I guess we all thought that the machines would go off, he’d perhaps make a death rattle and then he’d quietly slip off to eternal slumber. But that’s not what happens.What people don’t know about these situations is that people can linger in this limbo even after the drugs that keep their heart beating and the ventilator that keeps their lungs inhaling and exhaling are discontinued. So what happens is that they are starved to death.And so, for a week more, my husband lay in that bed ( without music!)I would come and rub a wet toothette along his parched tongue and lips, but water is dangerous for a person in this state because it can be aspirated and lead to a much more painful death. That’s something Son, the recent med school graduate didn’t seem to get.He started calling me and accusing me of being cruel and torturing his father. I was stunned! After telling me at the beginning to end it, here we were, and he was having second thoughts.I can’t tell you how horrible it is to have to make a decision like I did, but I can tell you that being criticized and accused of such foul deeds as he accused me of made it a hundred times worse!!!Finally, in the evening of the seventh day off of life support, my husband passed away. There’s a kind of relief underneath the sorrow when it’s finally over. And you might expect that the tragedy would have healed some of the hurt, but it didn’t.Some of the kids called but not Son. I asked some of the others to call him for me and begged for them to reassure me that they didn’t have the same feelings toward me. Luckily, they were all considerate and compassionate.All this happened about 5 1/2 years ago and I’ve only spoken to Son once:My husband was a great collector of books. We have among them, some very valuable tomes. A week or so later, Son called and asked if he could come over to collect a few items that were of sentimental value to him. I said, ““Sure! Just tell me what you need and I’ll collect it for you so you can just pick it up.”“No,” he said, “ I’d rather pick it out myself.”I refused to let him come picking through our house for valuables that he couldn’t name and that is the last time we’ve spoken.As an aside, I might add that my husband left a nice inheritance for his kids to split evenly. Unfortunately, he had not updated his will since before the birth of our daughter and she was accidentally left out. I told the kids about this and the guy administrating the estate said Son had called to confirm whether I was lying about it or not. ( I wasn’t .)**UpdateOne of my husband’s kids texted that he has his share of inheritance ready to transfer to my daughter. He said Son is also “interested” in doing this. He suggested the four of us get together for dinner to discuss. I told him I’d meet him or send her banking info, but to Son I’m still social distancing, lol!","3,528 followers",Hiro-o Ekimae,3.9K,987,6.1M,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-angriest-youve-been-with-your-in-laws

She had just escaped a near-death situation with her soon to be ex-husbnd, he was very verbally and physically abusive towards her and in his past relationships as well. He was very controlling over her to the point of stalking where she was and who she was with, and he is part of why her 7 year sobriety was thrown down the drain. He supplied her with meth, which fueled up her addiction again, so that she would become even more dependent on him. We helped her get him arrested for nearly beating her to death and then we got her placed into the facility to help her get sober again and stay sober, as well as help her get a job and house of her own.All of this was in July/August of 2019. I was around 18–20 weeks pregnant with our daughter.She stayed sober, or so we thought, up until the birth of our daughter in the beginning of February 2020.We found out about a week ago (beginning of March 2020) that she has been lying to us about her sobriety. We found out through two of her very close, sober friends,, that the day I gave birth to our daughter, my husband’s mother was in the hospital bathroom smoking meth as our daughter was being born.We are so hurt and angry, she’s lied to my husband before about being sober and cleaning her life up, but this time it’s worse. Our only conditions for her to be able to see our daughter were that she stay sober, and that if she relapsed, to ask us for help and we would help her get sober again.I blame myself for the pain it’s causing us because my husband had previously cut off all communication to his mother, but when she reached out to me wanting to reconnect with him, I pushed for him to talk to her again.We aren’t even mad about her relapsing, we’re disappointed and sad, but not angry.We are mad though, that she lied to us and that while our daughter, HER ONLY GRANDCHILD, was being born, she was more worried about getting high in a bathroom.",767 followers,Christina Baublitz,917,1.9K,403.4K,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-angriest-youve-been-with-your-in-laws

Feeling guilty that she had left her home and most of her possessions behind to come to the U.S. to marry him, and being an old-fashioned cowboy gentleman, he allowed her to do pretty much whatever she pleased. At that point, I was frustrated, but not yet angry.In the midst of all this, Dad's doctor decided that the back surgery he'd been avoiding for some time could no longer be put off. He would need assistance from a caregiver for 6 months at minimum, especially since he had a small farm to run. Since his crazy semi-estranged wife could obviously not be trusted to care for him or anything else, another alternative was needed. Our oldest son was the only person who was available, and he agreed to take on the job.Just before the surgery, I took my son down to his grandpa's to get him settled in, intending to go home a few days after Dad was back from the hospital.

It was just me and Dad's younger brother who had to go through the process of getting a restraining order to get her out of the house so it would be safe for him to go home.Now, you might be forgiven for thinking that was the angriest I've ever been with an in-law, but it gets worse.Phase 2Insane Scottish granny bought a house of her own and got a duelling restraining order, probably granted by the long-suffering judge (he was soFinally, she sprung her trap. She called him, desperately worried because her power was out. He went to help and found that the main breaker had simply been switched off. She called the sheriff, with the result that an 80-year-old man spent the night in the county jail for violating a restraining order.Dad had finally had enough. He got the divorce.Phase CWe thought things were going to get better at this point. Insane Scottish granny eventually went back to Scotland (to avoid deportation, I suspect), and we thought Dad was finally safe. He sold his small farm and moved into town.And then, last spring, he hit everyone in the family with news that left us gobsmacked: he was moving to Scotland to remarry the insane granny.After all she had put him through. After all my efforts (and those of other people as well) to protect him from her.ThatHe was not to be reasoned with, although I'm sure almost every member of the family expressed their displeasure. I was too angry to say anything, especially knowing it would do no good. We all gathered to bid him goodbye, expecting we would never see him alive again.Two weeks after he left for Scotland, he returned. There wouldn't be a remarriage. He said it was a mutual decision, but I suspect that she flipped her lid again and told him to leave.I'm still angry at him, to be honest. I had looked up to him as a respected and wise elder every since I married his son. Watching him allowing himself to be duped, abused, and manipulated—stubbornly resisting all wise counsel—was shocking. I can no longer respect him as I once did. That makes me sad as well as angry.","1,200 followers",Jennifer Finger,2.2K,7.3K,4.5M,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-angriest-youve-been-with-your-in-laws

He claimed that was the first he heard about a specific time. Now, come on!!! Who the hell shows up at 9:25 a.m. for a fucking 4th of July picnic?.

Miracles do come in different forms. It could be that it might have changed his mind in how to treat women. Or to atleast put his child's shoes on the receiving end of his predatory actions. There's plenty of miracles really. But for her to say that wasn't just acceptable to me.",1 follower,Priyanshi Singh,750,0,0,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-angriest-youve-been-with-your-in-laws

They talked it out and that was it.For about two years I sucked up being nice to him for the sake of my fiancé. I didn’t see him very often anyways. My FIL loves to make up stories about the cops because they beat him up after he dragged one of the cops with his car. Stories like they dressed up as the KKK with guns and shot up his house in the woods. He’s white by the way so I don’t know why they would dress up as the KKK…but that obviously didn’t happen.Then three years into dating my fiancé, my FIL was rushed to the hospital and almost died. Something like a cyst burst on his spine and he was septic. He lived! But my fiancé likes to put his fight and all the crazy things he said and did after that on the undiscovered cyst. So I fully forgave him and moved on.four years into our relationship and the man still doesn’t know my name. My fiancé and I were getting tired of living with my parents so he invited us to rent his basement apartment for $400. We were going to get married that summer so we thought it would be perfect to get out into our “own” place and still be able to save money! Two months into living there and fixing up the nasty apartment (at least $1000 worth of work), he doubled our rent to $800. He wanted to refinance his home. I honestly think he intended to have us pay $800 from the start but he just needed us to move in first. And no we didn’t have a contract because we didn’t think we would need one because….you know….family.we couldn’t move back into my parents house due to construction and we couldn’t afford to move out so we ended up struggling for 7 months. I lost all the money in my savings, my fiancé almost maxed out his credit card, and we had to postpone our wedding and stop saving for a house. I worked two jobs while finishing up my degree and my fiancé already worked a full time job and paid most of our bills. The apartment had mold and we could hear my FIL and the two other renters constantly fighting and throwing things. One was an alcoholic and always vomited in front of our door. When winter came I missed work and some school days because he didn’t want to hire someone to plow the quarter mile driveway.when summer hit, I was about to ask my parents if we could fix up their basement and move in there because we were broke and did not feel safe living there, when he got evicted from the property. he must not have been paying the mortgage, even though he said the refinance went through. Then he accused us of saying we never paid him and he never asked us to pay him rent. I showed him all the receipts and all the checks made out to him and checks he cashed when he refused to give us receipts.I have not seen the man since I moved out of his house. My fiancé was having breakfast once every other week with him, but my FIL started drinking heavily and was drunk every time my fiancé met with him. My mother in law said one of the reasons she left him was due to his drinking and I have never seen him without a beer.Other than my FIL, I have only hated one other person in my life and it’s the man who sexually abused me.My FIL is Invited to our wedding because I want to make my fiancé happy. But I have told him that I do not want photos of me and him together. He has hurt my fiancé time and time again and also hurt me and honestly scares me a little. My fiancé understands How I feel and is the most amazing man in the world and I couldn’t be happier. I have an amazing relationship with his mother and siblings, I just truly wish, for my fiancé’s sake, that someday my FIL becomes a better man.",305 followers,Gypsy Angori,1K,201,2.2M,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-angriest-youve-been-with-your-in-laws

It was a huge problem between us.Once I was arrested for a speeding ticket I had forgotten about for ten years. They locked me up.My ex made me sit in the local jail for 36 hours until my daughter found out and bailed me out.Why didn't my wife bail me out?To “teach me a lesson”.One of the many reasons I cannot bear to be around her even 15 years after the divorce.Last year her drunk brother got prison time for a serious DWI incident.She's spent a huge pile of money she doesn't have paying top dollar lawyers to try appeal his case. My kids told me that she's permanently pissed off at every time a criminal gets probation rather than prison time.Moral of the story? Never marry a groupie.
