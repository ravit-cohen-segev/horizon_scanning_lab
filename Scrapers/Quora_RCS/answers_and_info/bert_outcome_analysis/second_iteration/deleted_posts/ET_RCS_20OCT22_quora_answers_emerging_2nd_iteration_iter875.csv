This includes the Salamanders being literally as black as coal with glowing red eyes (no, that’s not hyperbole, that’s how they’re described), Space Wolves having wolflike canines like Leman Russ, etc.The problem arises when you look at the list of Primarchs. None of them that are canon are female. And if, somehow, a female neophyte of the Astartes were brought into an all-male chapter, and were in any way compatible with the geneseed (remember, every surgery and modification has a more-than-modern chance of failing and outright killing the neophyte), think of what the geneseed, which is designed to make the neophyte resemble the Primarch it’s descended from, would do to her body.Hint: They wouldn’t be a female Astartes by the end of the process.Now, there’s one way you COULD play a female chapter of Space Marines if you’re willing to kitbash.There are two missing Primarchs that are there so you can paint your own chapter and make it however you want. The homebrew chapters are encouraged by GW.So, take the heads off of Adeptus Sororitas models, stick them on Space Marines, and say your fem-marines came from one of the two missing Primarchs. I mean, realistically, female Astartes wouldn’t look any different, realistically speaking, than male Astartes, as boob plates aren’t realistic in any way, and whenever real medieval women wore armour it was the same armour worn by men, but hey, details.Or… You know, just main regular Sororitas if you want females in power armour.Just don’t try to shove this down everyone else’s throats.",345 followers,Michał Gawlas,601,3.2K,4.9M,https://www.quora.com/Why-is-there-such-a-push-to-get-female-Space-Marines-Is-it-logical-when-there-are-elite-female-factions-in-40k

2,"As far as I know there is no push on the part of GW to add female SMs. However, there has always been a push by segments of the fandom to include female SMs - even from long before the current political climate. I remember heated discussions about the lack of female SMs from 30 years ago. There are several reasons for this.Initially, because there was no elite female representation in the early days. When GW did start adding “bewbs” to their minis they were usually for less popular alien factions and many were initially little more than purile T&A to give the 13-year olds a thrill.Eventually,As far as I know there is no push on the part of GW to add female SMs. However, there has always been a push by segments of the fandom to include female SMs - even from long before the current political climate.

When GW did start adding “bewbs” to their minis they were usually for less popular alien factions and many were initially little more than purile T&A to give the 13-year olds a thrill.Eventually, GW introduced their first “serious” female warriors - the Sisters of Battle. But even after the introduction of the first Sisters of Battle miniatures there were people who wanted “real” female SMs.The impression of many people were that the SOB got short-changed. They were described in the fluff as elite women warriors nearly (but not) the equal of the SM chapters and their minis certainly looked cool but most of the players who played them found them to be pretty underwhelming on the table. I never played them, myself, so I could only take their word for it. I did play against them a couple of times and I don’t recall them being an especially tough fight for my Smurfs. (Cut me some slack - I was young and hadn’t discovered ‘nids yet.)Anyway, the SOB never really got the sales that GW wanted so they started tweaking the formula to try to pump up business. They merged the SOB into what was basically an “Inquisition” army but this only served to further dilute the flavor of the army by adding recycled IG storm troopers and male hero units while simultaneously failing to make them competitive. Sales didn’t improve and the line languished for a loong time with no new models and little support. For a long time, the SOB were only available as metal models from the online store - so basically special orders and were priced accordingly.Relatively recently, GW has revised the line to new interest, added new models and support products to drum up interest. This is a purely business driven action. GW finally recognized that there were actual female players who had an interest in a seeing something of themselves in their armies. Side Note 1: Psychological studies show us that most people seek to invest themselves into their fictional media. Many male players consciously or unconsciously project their own self image into their armies in one fashion or another. There are female players that want the same opportunity with their armies.But that still doesn’t address the issue for many people. The SMs are theWhile the SOB certainly are described as “elite” and they are female - they are not as “elite” as the SM who are exclusively male. So, the people seeking gender parity still feel short-changed.For my part, I don’t see what the big deal is for so many players. Why not have female SMs? Who really cares? It is more potential minis to collect and paint. It is more potential players to bring into the hobby. It is more acceptance in mainstream markets where all the real money is - so GW can be more profitable and produce more new stuff. If you don’t like female SMs don’t collect them. Buy some other minis instead. Why is it so important to rain on someone else’s fun?And don’t try that “It’s not canon!” BS with me. Sure, the canon says women can’t be Space Marines. But it also once said that no one could improve upon the Emperor’s Space Marine designs either. Look how that turned out. The ‘Nids used to have slave races that served them. Those races aren’t canon any more but they once were - GW even made minis for them. The canon is whatever GW says it is so if they wanted to add female SMs to the mix they could certainly do it. A bunch of neck-beards will throw tantrums online - just like they did with Primaris Marines. But if GW makes the female SMs competitive at the table you can bet those same neck-beards will quickly get over it - just like they did with the Primaris Marines.",UNKNOWN,Michael B.,540,6.4K,75.9M,https://www.quora.com/Why-is-there-such-a-push-to-get-female-Space-Marines-Is-it-logical-when-there-are-elite-female-factions-in-40k

It’s already been stated in the lore that Space Marines can only be male, and making a change this major for no reason other than identity politics points is just going to irritate the majority of people.Edit: I wrote this in a comment and thought it should belong in my answer.I don’t care what the character/army I play as is, I care who they are. I don’t care if they’re a female worker-bug from a moon of Jupiter, as long as the story/gameplay is interesting and cool and the characters are well developed. If I tried to insist that this franchise needed male worker bugs as well, so that I could personally feel some sort of “male connection” to them, in spite of the fact that said bugs are based on real ant hives and have been stated to only have females as worker bugs, you would probably call my complaints idiotic, wouldn’t you? Because what would that add to the story? My entitlement is the only reason to make the change.And that’s ignoring the fact that the proposed change is ridiculous anyways. The bugs are bugs, they’re not even human! They have no similar experiences or background to me!

I killed my own mother without knowing her face. I have killed nineteen of my own brothers in the last century alone, almost always in idiotic battles for possession of this sword, or over matters of bruised pride. I have no wish to unite the Legion. I hate the Legion. Not for what it is, but for what it made me become.’Variel still said nothing. Rather than seeming lost for words, he simply seemed to lack any desire to speak at all.‘There’s one thing I want,’ said Talos. ‘I want that alien witch’s head. I want to plant it on her spear at the heart of these ruins.’ Talos turned away from the gunship, walking away. ‘And I mean to have it. Stay in the air, Variel. Land once it’s over. Whether I live or die this night, you are welcome to my gene-seed come the dawn.’Cyrion left the ramp, following Talos. ‘I’m coming with you.’ Lucoryphus’s head jerked with a muscle tic in his neck.He briefly rose to his clawed feet, and stalked after the others. ‘I will join you.

Volatile memory (RAM) is WAY faster than nonvolatile memory, but if it isn't fed a constant voltage the memory will be lost. Nonvolatile memory (hard disks, flash drives, etc.) only needs power if you want to access or change the data.When you open a file, the file's data is sent from the nonvolatile memory to the volatile memory. When you make changes to the file, you're only altering what it looks like in the volatile memory. When you save the file, the nonvolatile memory is updated so the volatile and nonvolatile memory match. When you shut down your computer, your operating system saves a bunch of data to the nonvolatile memory, then tells the BIOS to stop sending voltage/power to the computer. If you only had volatile memory, you'd lose EVERYTHING when that happened: OS, programs, files, everything.There are a couple workarounds to this dilemma, but none of them are great. The most expensive option is NVRAM, which is basically nonvolatile memory that is so fast the OS can treat it like regular volatile memory. This is cutting edge tech, so there are a lot of problems with it that you'll have to work around, even beyond the price tag. Another option is to change what you boot from. It's technically possible (but unbearably slow in practice) to boot your computer from a USB drive or network drive instead of the normal hard disk. One big problem with this is that if the connection is broken, you’re in trouble. How much trouble you’re in depends on a lot of things, but the most pertinent one is paging. Modern OS’s will recognize when they’re running out of RAM for all the things you have open, and when that happens the OS effectively treats a portion of the hard disk like it’s RAM. If you disconnect the hard disk when it is paged and the OS tries to access that missing data, the system will probably crash.With all these problems, the big question I have isOn a side note, I believe the speed of your hard disk is one of the most underrated performance factors in a computer. Gamers and graphic designers require a decent GPU and computer scientists generally need lots of RAM and a good CPU, but for basic tasks people are generally limited by hard disk speed. Upgrade to an SSD and you’ll boot faster, applications and documents will load faster and installs will finish faster. Apple figured this out early, and it’s a big reason that the original Macbook Air (and almost all of their flagship laptops since then) had a fast SSD rather than a top-of-the-line CPU or GPU.Hope this helps,Edit: just realized you might be asking a different question.

Apparently, larger brains do have more neurons but they are less interconnected.

They will jump from one topic to another. They have sense of humor based on long-distance connections and patterns, they are witty and wise. They can search for answers when you eventually forgot that you ever asked them something, but which captivated them - and they will give you the answer after they did proper research - like, in a year or so. Get ready for unusual and complex answers.Often there is something childlike in them, they are playful, spontaneous, honest, and kind of vulnerable. They never hesitate to play, with a sparkle in their eye. They can get emotional easily and even overwhelmed; this goes better with age.They have no idea how amazing they actually are; they are humble, helpful, and caring. Treat them well and you get loyal companion, a beautiful mind with their heart on a sleeve. When they look into your eyes, it feels like they see the bottom of your soul, pleasing or intimidating, depends.They can have big baggage of issues, it’s not easy to live with extremely sharp senses, a mind few can keep pace with, galloping thoughts and emotions, as a kind of Martian with no clue about mundane stuff Earthlings seem to be familiar with, and being treated badly because of being different. They may overreact, freak out, get scared, do stupid stuff, feel bad vicious circle, especially if growing in traumatizing circumstances. They may be destructive, do drugs to calm their mind and blend into mold, to sink into average; not all are lucky enough to meet their tribe when growing up. Actually, they can be awkward, even rude in a world of white lies, hypocrisy, fake, and manipulation; it’s a blind spot for them and they just learn to be aware of it rather than naturally play the game.",3 followers,Amy Chai,2K,6.5K,114.8M,https://www.quora.com/Why-is-there-such-a-push-to-get-female-Space-Marines-Is-it-logical-when-there-are-elite-female-factions-in-40k

Some years ago, Julian Jaynes wrote a book titledIn 1976 Julian Jaynes published his controversial book The Origins of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind, introducing the hypothesis of a two-chambered brain-mind model that preceded the evolutionary development of the conscious mind. Jaynes’ speculative model gave rise to a huge debate, which has reverberated throughout the current neuroscientific and neurophilosophical literature. Has the bicameral mind stood the test of time? To answer this question, the present paper adopts a multidisciplinary perspective and, after briefly summarizing Jaynes’ hypothesis, addresses two main critical issues: the neurological basis of the bicameral model and the philological accuracy of Jaynes’ arguments. Finally, the concept of a non-unitary Self is presented as one of the most relevant contemporary legacies of the bicameral mind.A similar sort of condition — separate from Jaynes’ hypothetical — is observed in some autism cases, where long-term memory is more or less inaccessible to conscious recall, that function being performed by implicit (‘muscle”) memory inaccessible to the conscious mind. Magnetic resonance and positron emission imaging allow identification of where in the brain different kinds of information handling is performed and determine if, where and perhaps how an autism condition may result from atypical mentation. Given that my experience as an undiagnosed (then) “Aspie” working in high-tech firms was often more “resident magician” that normal engineer, together with the trouble I got into in algebra classes in 9th grade (writing down correct answers without being able to show the work) convinces me that the idea holds some merit.",324 followers,Don Raven,9.8K,0,0,https://www.quora.com/Why-is-there-such-a-push-to-get-female-Space-Marines-Is-it-logical-when-there-are-elite-female-factions-in-40k
