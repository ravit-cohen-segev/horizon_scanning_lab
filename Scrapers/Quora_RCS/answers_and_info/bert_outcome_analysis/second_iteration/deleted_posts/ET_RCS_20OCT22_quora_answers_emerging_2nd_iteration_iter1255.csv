'Managements' of companies often ignore the fact that 'Administrations'Paul Denlinger's answer to Is it lucky that China banned Facebook compared to other nations seeing that there is such a serious leakage of information by Facebook which could definitely compromise national security issues?China’s hate with social media platforms is consistent and as such is not restricted to Facebook. China has a very cautious approach to web platforms and communication intermediaries, because sustained incumbency is an ultimate priority of their government above all else, which mandates that no free hand be given to any platform. It may be well set in the rational fear that social media would be the common denominator in flaring up any domestic dissidence. Case closed.Now it is a windfall for China and the exposés coming one after one stand to vindicate the Chinese proactivity. Scandal or otherwise, Facebook could have never made it into the Chinese internet landscape anyway. Facebook, in particular, has been too arrogant with governments and the Chinese were the first to say ‘bite me’.Now, there are a slew of ‘Bite me’s to follow.The real threat to Facebook is and would be coming from countries that traditionally allowed it to operate.In India’s case, for example, much of the information on citizenry is rather public, even without Facebook or any other social media platform. The voter list of India published by the Election Commission contains far more accurate records of individuals than what Facebook would obtain through complex algorithms. So has the case been with Unique ID’s in India.True, Facebook obtained data about users that could specifically pin point their tastes and preferences, their search history and much more private data, but it is also to be noted that most of such information is dynamic. People change, their preferences change and so do their political opinions. Time extinguishes the value of information obtained over such platforms.[A person who has worked his ass up in his career would tend to be more conservative in political leaning than being a liberal. College students, once they leave their colleges, move away from liberal ideologies as reality strikes a different chord. Information so gained has a very short shelf life.]So in this fiasco, Targeted Advertising in the short run paid Facebook off with sweet cash, but not just that, it came at a cost. A very big cost.It sealed the business user segment permanently for Facebook for its corporate products globally in the future. No sane serious business would ever trust, buy or use any corporate product coming from Facebook. Auditors would raise red flags on their checklist of services of entities like Facebook if their clients have taken, all over the world. It’s like an unofficial blacklist.All it takes for governments now to corner Facebook is issue a circular of caution for people and businesses. Apparently, people trust governments more than a company based in Menlo Park or Cupertino.Governments can easily take defence of ‘Democratic Values’ and ‘Freedom’ to justify Facebook’s existence in their country effectively passing the buck to consumers, that is the people. Governments can take refuge in the fact that End User Agreements were not made at the behest of Government and people did that on their own volition.Any government can now issue an Executive Order cracking down on Facebook. That is something governments exactly want too, and now would do so with much less dissidence and lot more convenience.Punitive action on Facebook can benefit governments, giving them a better leeway in forcing the company toA few months down the line, Facebook’s counsels can be seen visiting courts in almost every country it operated. FB would soon be struggling in Asia and elsewhere. It is probably just the beginning to an end.And it is not the fault of Governments or users or some random organisation that queried a hell lot of Facebook data, allegedly, but something Facebook brought on to itself, and by a great measure its own complicity in numerous shady transactions. Governments and political parties would deliberately inundate the company with numerous allegations that can take years for Facebook to come clean, or never.Having not allowed it into the China’s ‘internet space’ saved a hell lot of legal expenditure and court appearances for Facebook.","220,226 followers",Franklin Veaux,3.5K,47.3K,779.7M,https://www.quora.com/Is-it-lucky-that-China-banned-Facebook-compared-to-other-nations-seeing-that-there-is-such-a-serious-leakage-of-information-by-Facebook-which-could-definitely-compromise-national-security-issues

5,"When my wife and I had been married for about a month and a half, she started having stomach pains. Strange bruises appeared on her legs, and she felt off most of the time. A trip to urgent care led to a trip to the ER, which led to a trip to see an oncologist at the hospital in the big city near us. She had leukemia.Treatment started immediately, and we had no way of knowing what would happen. I prepared myself for the worst while trying to be strong for her. I could do it most of the time.

Strange bruises appeared on her legs, and she felt off most of the time. A trip to urgent care led to a trip to the ER, which led to a trip to see an oncologist at the hospital in the big city near us. She had leukemia.Treatment started immediately, and we had no way of knowing what would happen. I prepared myself for the worst while trying to be strong for her. I could do it most of the time. After two weeks in the hospital she came home, and we started our new life that revolved around managing a disease that she still deals with to this day.Cancer wasn’t the hardest thing to overcome.Months later, I walked in on my wife’s boss shouting at her about how bad of a job she was doing. He knew she was getting used to being a sick person, and he wasn’t clear about his expectations for her, so he took out his frustration on her all at once. She was in tears, and I removed her from the situation as quickly as I could. That night we decided to move. It didn’t matter where as long as she didn’t have to work for that man anymore.I frantically began job searching, getting a handful of interviews and not feeling right about any of them. Out of the blue I got a call from my old boss who wanted me to come back and work full time for him in the same town where my family lived. He said “Bring your wife too, she can work here as well”. We cried tears of thanksgiving that we were going to be ok, and then we prepared to move our whole life to a new city and new jobs.Rapid change wasn’t the hardest thing to overcome.Three years and three babies later, we found ourselves in dire financial straits. Having children quickly was rewarding but incredibly stressful and busy, and our lives now revolved around them instead of my wife’s illness. In a way that was a blessing. It also meant we had very little money left after bills, and some months we had to borrow from friends to buy groceries.Both my parents and my wife’s parents had financial woes of their own, so we had to turn to friends often. The most humbling conversation I've ever had was asking friends for financial help, and feeling shameful about being in this position. Every single time our friends were more than willing to help. And every single time we were eventually able to pay them back, by the grace of God.Financial hardship still wasn’t the hardest thing to overcome.The hardest thing in life to overcome is despair. It is a crushing weight that can strangle the life out of your will to push through the troubles of life. Despair is the one thing that was always in the background for us through everything we dealt with, and it would have been easy to just give in and believe we would not make it through the trial. But we knew it was a lie, and kept believing that we would be ok.No matter what you’re dealing with, no matter how hard your life is, no matter how hopeless everything seems, do not fall into the lie of despair.***Edit: Wow, this is quite a response! I’m so glad our story is meaningful to other people, and thank you for all the kind words. We are blessed indeed.To answer a common question, my wife still has leukemia but she manages it with a daily medication. Aside from a couple of mild side effects she is healthy and feels good. Modern medicine is amazing.

At MIT, there are also dedicated systems to submitting your resume to career fairs, and I don't think there's any intention to adopt Piazza's systems for any of this.

That said, in business terms, I'm pessimistic that they've done enough to solidify their early lead.Unfair AdvantagesWhat does Piazza have going for it that gives it a leg up on other market entrants? Only two things: the strength of their offerings and the brand goodwill of existing users.Unfortunately, those users are millennials and instructors — two groups who tend to flock to the best active solution without any significant regard to product loyalty. In a very real way, being the first-to-market for that kind of user-base can actually be a net negative.(One might point to MySpace and Friendster as prominent examples of this phenomenon. They taught people what social networks where, priming the market for Facebook's entry. The same could be said of the early internet radio / music-streaming / photo-sharing services.)The quality of their offerings matters too, but perhaps less so given their limited scope.As for Careers, their lead is likely to turn against itself as they scale significantly — the busier the pond, the less effective it is for any recruiter.The Vultures Currently CirclingWho is gearing up to eat Piazza's lunch?
