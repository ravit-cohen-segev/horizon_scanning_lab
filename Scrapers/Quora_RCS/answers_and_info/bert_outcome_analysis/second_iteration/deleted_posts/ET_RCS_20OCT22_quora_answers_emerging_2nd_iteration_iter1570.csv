For a start, most of us don’t have time to sit in silence and meditate for an hour a day. However, there are plenty of simple ways to integrate mindfulness into your every day and they aren’t time-consuming.Awake to the dayStart your day by noticing your breathing and thoughts.

For a start, most of us don’t have time to sit in silence and meditate for an hour a day. However, there are plenty of simple ways to integrate mindfulness into your every day and they aren’t time-consuming.Awake to the dayStart your day by noticing your breathing and thoughts. There are many ways to do this and different habits suit different people. We all have unique schedules and morning routines. A great way is as soon as you wake up is to stop, breathe, notice your thoughts, emotions and feelings, and then begin your day. This simple practice will ensure from the very beginning of the day you are aware not only of your thoughts and feelings but also the effort of bringing mindfulness into the day.Morning habitsThere are other ways to start the day consciously. Your mindful morning practice might be intention and focus while you drink your coffee. Or it could be while brushing your teeth you focus on the sensation of brushing. You might even sit and meditate for five minutes.Check inThroughout the day, check in. If your body is tense, focus on relaxing it. If your mind is wandering try to bring it back to the moment.HouseworkThis might sound strange but cleaning, or in fact, any repetitive or seemingly monotonous task is the perfect time to practice mindfulness. Whether you’re mopping, cleaning windows or washing the dishes this is the ideal time to become present in the moment and experience greater peace and cultivate mindfulness. Try focusing on breathing or the task itself.Slow downWherever you’re going slow down a little and become more aware of your journey. For example, it doesn’t pay to speed home from work so you can spend your evening relaxing. An extra five minutes in the car can mean that you are calm all evening.Enjoy a time-outEvery now and then it helps to take a break. This allows you to relax during the day. You may choose to take a short nap or retreat to somewhere quiet to sit for a few minutes in silence. This stillness will make you return refreshed.Other activitiesThere are so many activities that are easy to do while being mindful like gardening, drawing and brushing your hair. These types of activities are much easier than when having a conversation.Mindful LocationsWhat’s great about mindfulness, particularly over meditation, is that it can be practised anywhere, but the following locations are great places to start.Get back to natureIt might sound obvious but get out in nature – maybe even take your shoes off. The sensation of the ground has become unfamiliar to most of us, so the physical sensations of it can really bring us into the present moment. Not to mention that it’s simply fun.At workEven behind a computer, it’s easy to be mindful. Focus on breathing for a minute or become conscious of your body. Check out 6 Easy Tips for Mindfulness at WorkIn the showerWhen you are in the shower, notice if your mind is skipping ahead to work and the day ahead. If it is, try to bring it back to the present moment. If you bring your attention back to your senses, the smell of soap, the sensation of water, the sound. This will bring you back to the now, and stop any worries taking over your morning.On the roadEvery time you stop at a red light, instead of letting your mind wander to the past or future, focus on your posture. These few minutes every day will contribute to your mindfulness and no time will be lost from your day.Create a calm cornerThis is your own special place so make it however you want. It could just be a comfy chair, a windowsill with a great view or a spot under your favourite tree, it doesn’t matter. What is important is that you establish this place as the place where you are mindful. Try not to do anything else in this spot except practising mindfulness. The more you do it the easier it will become and you will automatically start associating this location with calm and mindfulness.Focus on transitionsYou might have a calm corner, but you can’t stay there all day. Yet it’s easy to practise mindfulness of place while you’re on the move. Every time you move from outside to inside notice the changes that occur like temperature, sound and smell. This will bring you into the present moment.Mindfulness ToolsThere are so many tools that can help us practise mindfulness every day.Expand your knowledgeA great way to keep your interest and education in mindfulness going is by reading about it. The literature out there, including The Mindfulness Book by the MD of Roche Martin Martyn Newman, a concise and practical interpretation about how to practise mindfulness. Many of these books are also available in audiobook so you could listen on your commute to work.AppsUsually, mindfulness advice tells you to turn off all electronics, but that’s not always possible these days. But what can help stop you from playing a game could be a mindfulness app. There’s plenty to choose from. They offer led meditations, individual tracks, emotional check-ins and other programmes to help you on your mindfulness journey.Use your phone as a mindfulness promptIt’s easy to get caught up in a busy day and forget to practise mindfulness. An easy way to remember is to set a reminder on your phone to prompt you to focus on physical sensations or your breathing.Listen to musicThis might sound too good to be true but if we mindfully listen to music, we achieve a present awareness. Select a piece you’ve never heard before, shut your eyes and allow yourself to get lost inside the melody. If your focus wanders bring it back to the music.Turn off your phoneThere are so many great tools out there, but sometimes the best tool is having no technology distractions. Emails, the time, texts, social media, the weather, the news – your phone has it all and it can be very tempting to constantly check it. But this is distracting and takes us out of the present moment. A great way to stop yourself from looking at it is turning it off. Even if it’s just for thirty minutes a day. You can use this time to focus on the present.","66,020 followers",Niklas Göke,5K,235,32.2M,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-most-important-thing-which-an-aspirant-of-LLB-should-keep-in-mind

He charges right ahead and he doesn’t know what he’s doing most of the time.In every trio there is a thinker, a watcher and a doer. Take these three, for example:Who’s who is obvious:* Ron’s the doer. He charges right ahead and he doesn’t know what he’s doing most of the time.When you try to identify these types for the people in your life, you’ll see the thinkers are the ones who seem to have it the easiest while the doers are frustrated a lot.That’s because this categorization corresponds to different levels of self-awareness: the thinkers know themselves best.However, you can’t jump from one to the other overnight. It takes years of practice. I want to show you three exercises you can use to start.1. For Doers: Apologize.Since he does first and thinks later, Ron is often wrong. That’s why he’s making a fair share of apologies. Apologies to Harry, apologies to Hermione, apologies to his family.As a doer, that’s one of the best things he can do.You can’t apologize without acknowledging you’ve made a mistake. This acknowledgement is where self-awareness comes from.We hate admitting mistakes more than making them, but when you do, you won’t turn into a hypocrite and can reflect how you can do better next time.Apologize fast, apologize often.2. For Watchers: Journal.When you observe so much, it’s hard to keep track of everything without writing it down. And write a lot Harry does. He writes letters to everyone, he writes in detention and he even had a diary that one time…This is a good idea for watchers in general.There’s a saying by Confucius:> “You cannot open a book without learning something.” – ConfuciusWell, you also can’t write a sentence without learning something. The simplest form of journaling I know is the 1-sentence journal.Take a thought-provoking question and answer it in one sentence, but answer differently each day.* Why did you get up this morning?Even in this tiny format, journaling helps your brain structure the things you observe and get better at filtering what matters.You’re great at watching life. Might as well remember what’s important.3.

I was impressed with his intellectual skills, communication skills [He was pretty good with his English vocab too], people skills etc. Humbly I asked, “Why this job?”,he just smiled and started humming the song which kept playing on loop during the trip.—Cut—From Jan of this year, one of my everyday tasks is to handle Online live sessions [Webinars] on different topics like career guidance, skill development, aptitude preparation, company specific training, Bank exams coaching etc. I have handled over 90 webinars in the span of 3 and a half months and over 18000 students [approx] have attended my sessions. I remember a day when one of the student who attended my webinar, who was graduated in 2017 pinged me in WhatsApp saying “Sir, I got a job in a XXXX and the starting salary is 12,000. Thanks for helping me out”. When I checked my master attendees list, he was a student who attended my session on “How to get placed in Infosys”. I was confused whether to feel happy or sad for this message!I am sure there are lakhs of people in this two category in our developing country.Unemployment or Underemployment? I am leaving it for you to decide!But, there are plenty of opportunities outside.. You should always be aware about the extra information!You can either be like the engineer who decided to start his career as a driver or you can be like that student who can settle for any job without worrying about the future career.For me, both of them are the same! They did not get that extra information to get the job they deserve!Follow the right people at right place! and there is a famous english dialogue in a tamil movie which I always quote - “Information is Wealth”.All the best!",362 followers,Shireen Jaffer,1K,0,0,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-most-important-thing-which-an-aspirant-of-LLB-should-keep-in-mind

Finding a job anywhere in this world is difficult. The thing is when we have solid degrees with good experience in hand, We set our expectation high and look for a reputed fortune 500. Even foreigner people struggle for good opportunities.Few reasons why it is so difficult to find a job:1)The employer expects multitasking people and we are always prepared for what we are experts in.2)Our resumes are set as per our skill sets but the employer looks for additional skill sets. (Learning: Whenever you are applying for an opening, make sure to update your profile in the resume as per company requirement and then submit.)3)Nowadays no company wants to invest in such candidates to whom they need to teach. They want a person who joins the company and handles the work from the very first day. Remember they start judging your work from the very first day.4)Somewhere HR is not sharp enough to screen your profile properly. Suppose there are ten things matching their requirements and two things are not. They will focus on those two missing things.5)Most of the companies give importance to degrees than skill, experience.6)Specific in India, Majorly the MNC give preference to English language and not everyone comfortable with. A number of regions have a number of languages. The employer wants us to behave like Britishers. They want all in one package.Due to the high expectation at both ends, it becomes really difficult to find a stable job anywhere.I tried to be genuine and honest.",0 followers,Stephen Kurtzman,1K,3.2K,9.2M,https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-most-important-thing-which-an-aspirant-of-LLB-should-keep-in-mind
