He is also comic book royalty. Like Superman or Captain Marvel (Shazam), he is one of the original blue prints of the comic book heroes we take for granted today.B) Intellect Level (DC’s replacement of a IQ score) has always been all around the room for Lex Luthor. He has been at 7 (four levels above humans, one level below Batman) to that of 12 (the highest I.L.). This changes because of inconsistent writing, to that of plot.C. Batman’s Intellect Level is also inconsistent. For someone at the level of 8, same as Krypton’s greatest scientist, Jor-El, he has been able to not only reverse engineer a Motherbox (God-Tech), but hack all of Apokalypse’s Motherbox’s. They are sentient. This alone should be beyond any life form below the God Tier. And where I’d usually put this feat to bulls**t, he has done this twice in the Modern Age.D. Batman’s main reason for being superior out of universe is the same as reason A. He is their primary genius. He was designed to be their primary genius eighty years ago. But the other one is…E. Action Comics, aka Superman comics, are not exactly canon in the greater DCverse. For reasons I’ve never really understood, they have their own editor. Their comics are made for Superman fans and not for continuity. This is why you can read Wonder Woman telling Superman he is the most powerful one of them on Earth in the JLA headquarters in a Action Comic, then see her tell him he’s not in a JLA comic. Because JLA/JL is under DC’s editor and thus the greater DCverse. One is written for Superman fans, because that’s Supermans audience, aka the cash cow. And the other is written in balance with the rest of continuity. If you were raised in the Modern Age, you’d understand this. Continuity between these two were tedious and all over the place. As a result Lex Luthor will seem superior in one version, but less so in another. However to be fair here, Lex was never really well written till the nineties. To put this in better terms, Lex Luthor is the smartest human within Action Comics, outside of it in the greater DCverse he is the worlds greatest egocentric.F. A in universe answer is that because of Lex’s demented outlook, he is mentally handicapped from reaching is fullest potential, often rushing things, or letting his ego and hubris get the better of him.As it stands though, Luthor has nothing over Batman in feats. This is largely do to the fact that as far as I know, Batman has no limits to his Intellect. Yes, he is at Level 8, but like I said, his feats regarding the Motherbox’s shouldn’t be possible for someone not a god.","2,697 followers",Jean Willow,5.1K,1.8K,13.1M,https://www.quora.com/Is-Lex-Luthor-smarter-than-Batman

At that moment, they are attack by Vultures and droid tri-fighters. What happens now, is a full charge in into the droids (see picture).Why the hell would you do that?I mean look at this. Their Venator class Star Destroyers are so close to the droid central command ships and Subjugators. When they have powerful long range weapons (as we saw in TLJ) they could put themselves at the other side of the planet, and not risk their capital ships to fall, like we see in this pirate-like shootout a few minutes into the film.3. PhysicsYou see this X-Wing? Looks nice, huh? But I do really wonder, how do they turn, in space, without turning their engines (with are, as far as I know, stuck in this position)? How do they slow down in space, where there is no gravity, and no air resistance to slow them down? They have no flaps (well, the Snowspeeder does, so that one doesn’t count here), their engines can’t turn in another direction but forward.Yeah, the space battles are not very realistic, but still look very nice, though.Hope that helps, and as always: may the Force be with you.","1,908 followers",Brett Lissaman,1.1K,472,20M,https://www.quora.com/Is-Lex-Luthor-smarter-than-Batman

I stood in my corner watching, because everyone was quiet, so the noise was not forcing me to remain rigid. It finally got to me, I walked out, solved every puzzle in the middle of the room, and then walked back to my corner. When commissioners tried to congratulate me, I cringed away. I did not do it for the praise, I did it because my mind solved it and it was irritating to me that it remained unsolved in the room. It did not change my status with the kids or teachers. When called upon to answer, I froze overwhelmed. I was punished for tantrums all my life, so my reaction became deer in the headlights. I was friendless. But my mom fought for me to be in normal school and I passed all aptitude tests. So clearly not stupid. I was not toilet trained until 8, mostly because a daycare teacher refused to let me go when I needed to, so I was sort of trained to have accidents. All the neurotypical kids could go when she told them to go. I could only go when I had to.The few kids who tried to be friends discovered that I can only be friends one on one. More than one friend overwhelmed me and I would start biting. I had no idea what personal space was, my mom solved that by making me wear a hula hoop around me. If I bumped into people with a hula hoop, then I was too close. It became an unbreakable rule in my head. I could not read people’s faces. I had no idea if people were sneering at me, laughing at me, or simply smiling. Same with tone of voice. I solved that by seeking out medical/psychology books in the library that explained it all. To this day, I am phenomenal at “textbook” facial expressions and intonations. But people who deliver stories and jokes in a deadpan voice confuse me.I was obsessed with dogs and dog facts. Eventually I got a Great Dane puppy, and I spent a ton of time training her. She was my guardian, but also my ice breaker. People would ask questions about her, and I was a fountain of facts.Moving to the US at age 13 was like mass therapy (yes, we brought the Great Dane). I did not speak the language or know the customs. And for the first time in my life, the excuse was that I was foreign. And Americans all obliged. “No, say it this way!”, “No, in these situations people do this!”, “When this happens, the customary response is this!” It was incredible. I went through high school being the weird foreigner. But I absorbed every direction and correction like a sponge. Teachers did not call on me, because English was tough for me and I froze. Little did they know I froze for other reasons, but it helped. I can pass any paper test. So there was no doubt I was smart. By senior year, I could mimic any neurotypical kid and could pass for neurotypical. It was all an act, but when forced to live with normals, that was my coping mechanism. Kids still remembered me as weird, but I also grew to be pretty, so boys were willing to overlook weird here and there. And one on one interaction was fine for me. I did not do parties or concerts.College was an all new world. I had almost no accent, could mimic neurotypical, and was pretty. I formed all my friendships for life in college. Still did not have a clue what was wrong with me, or why I was so different, or why I was constantly hiding my true self. People learned I was basically a computer. I could not put myself into someone’s shoes when they were heartbroken or hurting. I did however know what to do when told that was the problem. I had textbook solutions and they worked for most. But my overwhelmed state split into two, I either froze and became catatonic, or I went off in uncontrolled rage. After college, I got a good job and finally went to a psychiatrist. He diagnosed me with Asperger’s. It was eye opening. I developed certain tools to deal with life.I eventually met my husband. Within two weeks of dating, I knew he was special. I sat him down and explained everything. His response was that he liked me as I was, so who cares what “name” my condition had. We have been together for 20 years, married for 17. We have 3 neurotypical kids. I fear that he lost most of his friends because of me over the years, but he says there just isn’t time in our schedules to foster the friendships. He is super introverted, so it does not seem to bother him. The kids have never known anything different. They know I love them. They know I would do anything for them. And they know when they need a hug to just come and hug me. I am never going to initiate hugs, but once they point blank tell me what they need, they get it. I just don’t think of it.I also am in a job that fits me. I do pharmaceutical manufacturing investigations. I am a computer when it comes to engineering details and precedent. I can remember how I handled a situation at a different site 5 years ago and apply it accordingly. Often, my solutions are elegant and solve the issue, so men who normally scoff at women engineers seek my opinion. I am a microbiologist by education, so I am also consulted on micro deviations. And I am a phenomenal technical writer. So, I can write a document in hours that the FDA will not find any issues with in review. So, I get high profile investigations. But, I have limitations. I can lead teams in very structured situations, but I cannot have direct reports. I have my rages well under control, but they bleed through as “somewhat volatile”. I have found a hobby in photography, so it is the best camouflage for social situations and gatherings. Especially at work. I am the site photographer and can be at every gathering because I am focused on photography. So, that has always been my mantra. Camouflage among the neurotypical people.

Let's move on to social coaching.All of that was done before his diagnosis. But that is not to say that a diagnosis is unnecessary. When my son was diagnosed just before he turned 5, it just clicked to me. It explained everything about my son, why he is who he is, why he does the things he does. Everything makes sense. When I went on and did my research, I learnt so much more about my son and the world of neurodivergent. I trained myself everyday to be more patient, more understanding. We have been patient through all those coaching that at times feel ineffective and we have learnt that our son would get it in the end. Now we know that we will have to be just as patient and open to learning for the rest of our life to make sure he has the best life possible.",43 followers,Joanne Lim,8.3K,73,6.4M,https://www.quora.com/Is-Lex-Luthor-smarter-than-Batman

Once I have a special interest, I will be consumed by it for an extended period of time, like I’ve been sucked into a vortex.Autism awareness just wasn’t around in Asia in the 90s. Back then, only severely autistic kids got diagnosed, many others - especially girls slipped under the radar. While my mom certainly thought my brother and I were “off”, she dismissed our (autistic) traits as just quirks and tried her best to make us “normal”. I don’t blame her for that, with the little (mis)information about autism at that time, how was anyone going to know?In hindsight, both good and bad have come out of this.First, the bad.Like many other autistic kids, I did not know how to self-regulate my sensory issues. Going to the mall was horrible - with bright neon lights and loud music designed to capture attention. Not to mention the crowd in the mall. I did not scream when having a meltdown, but tried my best to hold it in. I probably looked obviously distressed, and so my mom - or other adults like her best friend or my aunt, would ask me if I was hungry or cold. Without warning, I would then start crying.My aunt legitimately thought it was a case of a child seeing ghosts - such stories are pretty common in Southeast Asia. She actually tried getting my mom to bring me to the temple to have it sorted. My mom didn’t think so, but mistakenly thought she was dealing with an attention-seeking child. So one day, like a typical Asian parent, she used the cane to “discipline” me.“If you want to cry, you cry now and be done with it.” My mother was seriously fed up, and had run out of patience by then. Now, before y’all judge her, try putting yourselves in her shoes. She was a tired, working, neurotypical mom who didn’t know what to do with this kid. There wasn’t Google to ask in 1998 Malaysia. Autism awareness in Asia was nonexistent. Had she known, perhaps she would have more patience and compassion with me.After that caning, I didn’t break down in tears again when my senses were overwhelmed. And so my mom thought whatever it was before, it was now fixed. However, I’ve grown up having serious discomfort with expressing my emotions. I cringe when a piano piece, or a dance choreography requires me to put my emotions on full display for everyone to see. Perhaps as a result of having problems with showing vulnerability, I also have trouble asking for help when needed.It wasn’t like my meltdowns didn’t happen again. They still did - only that it now showed up like a temper tantrum. So growing up, my mom thought I was a bad, misbehaving, disrespectful child. Go figure what that did for my self-esteem. I had to take myself to therapy as an adult.Now, the good.I’ve seen some parents with autistic children who become overly lenient with them (“Oh, my kid is autistic, he/she doesn’t need to do anything. I’ll just do it for my child.”) I understand being more patient with autistic kids - many will require you to have the zen of a Shaolin monk. However, doing everything for the autistic child, instead of teaching them how to be independent isn’t helping them. You can’t be around for them forever, and it’s unfair to ask their siblings to sacrifice the same for them.I have a friend who is highly likely to be an undiagnosed autistic girl too. Her mom did everything for her, instead of nudging, guiding or encouraging her to learn. Now that she’s in her late 20s, she still can’t drive herself around town. Her time management is terrible, and poor girl still can’t speak in a complete sentence without stammering. Her makeup skills are great, and she could have made a living out of them if it wasn’t because of her lack of independence.In my case, because my mom was unaware she has an autistic daughter, she constantly pushed me to learn to be functional. Had she known, she may have just done everything for me. I have aphantasia, as a result, I can’t remember street directions to save my life. Teaching me to drive was both frustrating and nerve-wrecking, I don’t know where my mother got the courage to sit next to me while I whined and drove, while other drivers honked angrily and overtook us all the time. I still suck at parallel parking because I can’t estimate space, but I can at least drive, under 120 km/h with a GPS.When she realised I was stammering when I talked - maybe as a result of social anxiety (common for autistic people), she made me read articles, out loud, from the papers. It was a colossal pain, and I definitely felt self-conscious about reading out loud. But it did the job.When she finally realised many of my “temper tantrums” were caused by loud, high pitched noises around me, she advised me to think of a solution. “You can’t expect the whole village to bend to your needs,” she said. She’s not wrong about this. I have since gotten my noise-cancellation earphones and headphones. Whereas I see lots of parents with autistic kids expecting the whole wide world to make unreasonable concessions for their kids - your world may revolve around your kid, but the world sure as hell doesn’t.",986 followers,Angel Searle,2.1K,760,5.1M,https://www.quora.com/Is-Lex-Luthor-smarter-than-Batman

Normal literally means average, but it has the unfortunate connotation of meaning the opposite of “abnormal.”What you’re really asking is what happens when an autistic child remains undiagnosed. Millions of autistic people have gone through their childhood, if not their entire lives, without being labelled autistic. Some have struggled with socialization or executive level functioning, or sensory integration, without knowing why. Many simply adjust. When the problems are severe enough to interfere with basic life functions, the child is usually diagnosed. If the problems are mild and more than offset by the very real advantages that autism can provide, then there really isn’t any reason for a diagnosis and a label.I was diagnosed at the age of 3 in 1965. The doctor told my mother that I would never learn to talk or socialize or have any significant quality of life. He told her the kindest thing she could do was put me in an institution and forget I was ever born. My mother refused, and when I started talking months later, and learned to read by the age of 4, she believed the doctor was simply wrong about the diagnosis, rather than wrong about the prognosis. So I was raised as any other kid. She told me when I was 12, but we still believed that I wasn’t autistic because autism was still even more poorly understood then than it is today. It wasn’t until my twin nephews were diagnosed that we realized that both my mother and I are autistic, as are likely my two brothers, another nephew, a niece, my grandmother, and my three children. Autism is so prevalent in my family that when my sister turned out neurotypical, my mother thought there was something wrong with her. Only 3 have been formally diagnosed and officially labelled—myself and two of my nephews.My experience is fairly typical among autistic people of my age who seem relatively neurotypical. One of my good friends was also diagnosed at the age of 3, and his mother also told to institutionalize him. She also declined. Today he is a statistics professor. We can look through history to find people who were likely autistic—Einstein, Steve Jobs, William Faulkner, Newton, DaVinci. Not every autistic person is a genius, of course, but most of us have some intellectual or creative advantage that offsets issues caused by autism.In short, if someone can adjust to difficulties well enough to avoid being diagnosed, that’s not a tragedy.","22,353 followers",Anthony Zarrella,1.1K,3.8K,50.5M,https://www.quora.com/Theoretically-speaking-how-realistic-are-the-space-battles-in-Star-Wars

You do need to understand that autistic people have additional needs that people without disabilities may not have, and accommodate these needs. Autistic children should be able to have as many opportunities as non-autistic children have, as far as it is possible.Reduced or no eye contact, stimming, difficulty understanding nonverbal language of non-autistic people, difficulty understanding figurative language, needing rigid routines, difficulty coping with change, sensory processing needs, special interests, and other autistic traits are okay. Accommodations can help your autistic child do certain things: for example, if they have difficulty with transitions, transition cues such as a visual timetable, timer or pressing a handheld bell when transitioning to a new activity can help them with transitions. Explicitly teaching figurative language to your autistic child can help them understand it, but this may or may not help them understand it, and does not guarantee your child understand other types of figurative language, and that is okay. Many things about your autistic child are things that do not need to be changed. For example, some autistic children may not make eye contact or may stim such as hand flap, but that is for a valid reason and are no less valid forms of communication and self-regulation as the communication of non-autistic. Some autistic children may find eye contact physically painful, and stimming can help them express their emotions and regulate themselves, so why try to stop autistic child doing something that helps them just due to society’s ableism?You would not expect a person who cannot walk to walk or to use the stairs, or expect a person who can only safely walk short distances for short periods of time to walk long distances for long periods of time. You should not expect autistic children to do things that they cannot do, to do things without accommodations, or to do things that hurt their well-being.

27,"I take issue with most of the answers here. The question was not, and is not: “Will computers ever have so much memory that we need 128 bit addressing to address it all?” That’s the question I see most people answering. 128 bit computing does not mean storage requiring 128 bits to address it all.In the 1970’s, IBM’s Rochester, MN lab developed the IBM System/38. The processor used 48 bit addressing. The original models maxed out at 1536K bytes of main storage at the time. (Why did they doI take issue with most of the answers here.

The processor used 48 bit addressing. The original models maxed out at 1536K bytes of main storage at the time. (Why did they do this? Because addresses were used as the fundamental way of identifying data in a persistent way. Contrast that to Unix/Linux/Windows, where the fundamental way of identifying data is with a hierachical named path, combined with a 32-bit or (more commonly now) 64-bit offset into a stream file found at the path. The Unix/Linux names are not unique, as multiple hard links can be established to the same file. The Unix/Linux names are scoped to a particular machine, (actually a single file system on a logical device) and if you want to extend the naming to multiple machines, you need other disparate addressing techniques. So to write the address of one byte of persistent storage residing on one of a related collection of machines/file systems,you need a multi-part address — Identify the machine, the device, the path to a file within the device file system, and the byte offset within the file. (The first three can be combined into a path, with mounting and symbolic links and such, but this makes for even more non-unique ways to get to the same byte.)On the System/38 (and through all of its follow on successors up to IBM i running on IBM Power hardware) the single address (which is now 64 bits) can be used to uniquely identify a specific byte from the time that byte (or the segment containing that and many other bytes) comes into existence until it is destroyed. The user friendly name is mapped over the address, rather than mapping an address over a name (like mmap does).Part of the 64 bit address space is reserved for ‘temporary’ storage that is locally used on a single logical partition, and whose storage only survives until the machine is re-booted. However, these temporary addresses are not re-used (unless specifically permitted by the owner) so an address to this temporary storage can be tucked away in a persistent storage object and after a re-boot the temporary address is guaranteed to ‘segment fault’ if used— it won’t address some random new piece of storage.Other parts of the 64 bit address space are use for persistent storage scoped to a logical partition. This storage persists at the given address until explicitly deleted. Such objects can easily exist for years or even decades, surviving re-boots, OS upgrades, hardware upgrades, complete disk replacements, and so forth.Finally, a portion of the 64 bit address space is reserved for Independant Auxillary Storage Pools or iASPs. These addresses are unique across a cluster of machines, and the storage units holding the data or just the data itself can be moved from one machine to another in a wide variety of ways, and continue to be addressed by its one unique address throughout its lifetime.As if that wasn’t enough, way back in the System/38 days, the architects actually allocated 128 bits for pointers. Although some of these bits are used for non-addressing functions, there is room to grow beyond the 64 bits.Of course in all of this, these 48 bit addresses and now 64 bit addresses are DIRECTLY usable in processor load and store instructions (with a suitable page fault handler, of course)In more recent embodiments, there is also the ability to have an entirely separate 64 bit address space, which is primarily used for process local storage (prior to this the temporary range of the ‘regular’ 64 bit address space was used.) The addresses are self identifying as to which 64 bit address space they are associated with.I could easily see a day where 128 bit addressing is used and all storage among all machines EVERYWHERE of such an architecture are entirely unique and never used twice anywhere.We don’t need to wait until we have gobs of physical storage to have a legitimate use for 128 bit addressing.","1,135 followers",Wim ten Brink,2.2K,2.2K,5.9M,https://www.quora.com/Theoretically-speaking-how-realistic-are-the-space-battles-in-Star-Wars

Most programmers today have little knowledge of how a processor actually works and so many misconceptions creep in. For instance, many Answers you see on this question deal with memory addressing and this is definitely not what is meant by a 32 or 64 bit chip. Let me give you just a little insight.You probably know that back in the day, there were 8 bit computers. Since bits are binary or one bit can contain two states (the on or off you hear about), multiple bits can contain 2 to the power of how many there are. So 8 bits of information is 2 to the power of 8 or 256. Obviously, 8 bit computers could access more than 256 bits of memory. Many could access 64 kilobytes of memory. This leads us to a split in what bits mean in a computer.Processors use bits in two different ways. First there is data. That's the information that the processor is recieving. Then there are address bits. These bits are how a processor tells memory where the information is stored. These are typically seperate pins on a processor. An 8 bit chip may have 16 address pins to access 64k of memory but when that data comes in, its on 8 pins of the separate data bus. (In some old slow processors these were multiplexed remember I'm trying to keep it simple though). In the chip are what is called registers. These are little bins that the processor keeps the data that is currently being working on. Not cache, just a handful of bytes. These registers are usually the size of the ‘bits’ the processor is. An 8 bit processor has registers eight bits wide, 64 bit processors have 64 bit wide registers. for the most part this is true but there are exceptions.An 8 bit processor will have two registers together to make one 16 bit address register. 2 to the power of 16 is 64k bytes. This is how a processor like the 8080 or 8085 works.The 8086 is a 16 bit processor and the registers are 16 bits wide. However, that processor has 20 bits of addressing and can access 1MB. It also has 16 data pins. The 8088 only had 8 data pins but 16 bit registers. So it has to wait two clocks to fill the registers. That's why it was cheaper. These ran on dos and dos based windows. This was known as a 16 bit operating system but can access much more than 64 kb of memory. In fact, the hard limit for windows 3.11 memory is 4Gb. These used a page system. Another register would be a pointer register to address a 64kb page of memory that was called by the 16 bit address register. So, clearly the limiting impediment to memory is the operating system and the features of the processor and not the inherent 'bitness’. 32 bit processors could access more than 4GB if Intel wanted to put in a pointer register or just widen the address register. However, the so called ‘flat memory model’ is easier to work with and probably faster.Current 64 bit processors use 40 bit (only twice the lines of a 8086) addressing which can address 1 terabyte not 64 bits which is ….. Alot… about 16 exabytes. Why make manufacturing the processor more difficult than necessary by adding pins for addressing that the end user is never going to use? The option is there however and as our memory requirements increase, future processors can add more address pins within the 64 bit framework.Microsoft started supporting 32 bit functions in windows with the win32s extension of windows 3.1 in 1992. OS/2 also supported 32 bits earlier that same year.When the Pentium processor came out in 1993 they toyed with calling it 64 bits because it was superscaler and could issue 2 32 bit instructions at the same time.Later in 1997, mmx technology was developed and added 64 bit MMX registers to the Pentium.Then in 1999 the SSE instruction set was released with the pentium 3. This was a 128 bit instruction set. Now this was what is commonly referred to a a 32 bit chip capable of doing 128 bit operations.Intel released the 64 bit itanium processor in 2001.AVX instructions and registers were introduced in 2011 with the Sandy bridge architecture. This is a 256 bit system. AVX 512 is a 512 bit system showing up on knights landing from 2016.Today's dual channel memory can transfer 128 bits to and from memory and there are also some quad channel systems.You can see that it is a complicated situation. In order for today's processors to make the most of their transistor budget, parts are high bit where they need to be and low bit where they don't need to be any higher. The truth is, 64 bits is a truly massive amount of bits for many applications such as most common math and addressing. There is just no need for 128 bits or higher most of the time. Maybe someday but the same argument between 32 and 64 bit happened in the early 2000s.When the operating system states its for 64 bit processors, it is requiring a certain minimum processor functionality to work with the os. other programs may take advantage of other processor functions beyond what is required by the os.Edit: I am adding another type of computer in order to answer a comment. I think more people will see it here. I did not want to bring this one up because it’s a difficult concept but consider this bonus material.Most of the processers we think of these days are of the Von Neuman type and this does tend to align memory addressing with the “bitness” - not all the time as shown above but most. There is another type of major architecture called the Harvard Architecture. In this type of computer, word width, timing, implementation technology, and memory access structure can all be different. Many times, the instruction bus and memory is totally decoupled from the data bus and memory and can be any size and can be accessed at the same time. Sometimes it can even be partitioned by the programmer.For instance… in a normal Von Neuman design, one instruction codes for one operation, but the Intel Itanium implementation utilizes what’s called VLIW or a very long instruction word. This is a 128 bit instruction “bundle” which pulls in three 41 bit instructions (or “syllables” of the “word”) and 5 template bits which define how those syllables relate (or not) to each other.With a Von Neuman parallel processor, there are two identical processing units and there is a hardware layer that searches for the proper instructions to execute and then issues them to the execution cores. In the Harvard system, the instruction has the parallelism built in (Explicit Parallel Instruction Computing or EPIC). The instruction can include for example both a floating point multiply and and add instruction at the same time. However, in order to work properly, the code is almost always compiled rather than hand assembled because it is so complicated and exact. In this way, the processor can be much less complicated because it doesn’t have to predict fetches and allocate issues on the fly. All the hard work is done by the complier. This can be much faster for limited circuit complexity.Another example is the Super Harvard Architecture Single Chip Computer uses a 48 bit word instruction, 32 bit word for integers and floating point numbers and 40 bits for extended floating point numbers.This type of architecture is not obscure. It is very suited for digital signal processing uses. A lot of computers these days are some sort of hybrid designs between Harvard and Von Neuman (also known as Princeton) architectures. For instance, most level 1 cache these days are separated between instruction space and data space.Again, this is a more extreme example of how the size of the memory addressing doesn’t represent the bitness of the processor. There can be many different types of architecture if we wanted to produce them that could be incredibly diverse however, its easier to focus study and design on just two types unless we can prove something new is more efficient.",5 followers,Wasim Momin,1.1K,0,0,https://www.quora.com/Theoretically-speaking-how-realistic-are-the-space-battles-in-Star-Wars

Because the Harrier did not have computer controlled anti-lock brakes, and to save weight ONLY the tiny little front nose wheel can supply braking power. This is done not only to save weight, but in case the pilot locks up the brakes. If you lock up just the front nose wheel, then the jet does not spin out of control. (Simple slides rather straight ahead). With rear brakes, then locking up on wet decks could cause a spin. If computer anti-lock breaks were available on the Harrier, then they likely would have adopted rolling landings.So with wet decks, and shorter decks, it was simply too dangerous for the Harrier to use rolling landings. It also why ONLY that tiny little front wheel on the Harrier provides all the stopping power. It really is poor, but then again, the Harrier really don’t need a lot of stopping power - it can land VERY slow . So on regular runways, they can and do use rolling landings - it thus requires little brakes to stop the Harrrier.With the F35B, you have 3 point computer controlled anti-skid breaking. So it can’t spin, and has full anti-lock brakes, and has them on all 3 wheels.In fact a long time Harrier pilot recently wrote British parliament warning against using rolling landings since with rain, bouncing decks and equipment on the deck, he stated that rolling landings are a disaster waiting to happen. You slide into a row of F35’s on deck, and you have real mess! What if you slide into equipment? What about sliding into the tower? So it is a significant worry and issue.However, I don’t think this pilot realizes how amazing and controllable the F35B is.So, here is a rolling landing. Should we brace for impact? Should we write parliament? Should we call mommy?Is this going to be oh so beyond dangerous?Well, we were all on pins and needles as to how well (or bad) this concept would work. Get out some popcorn.Here is the video of the first such landing on the new HMS Q:Ready?Are you all scared?Hang on to your pants!!Brace for impact!!!!Wow, was that easy or what?So due to computer controls on the F35B, this type of landing is now deemed to be operational safe. And this type of landing will increase the return fuel and payloads by 2000 lbs. As a result the total return store rating will be 7,000 lbs. The F35B is rated for 5,000 lbs return store rating in 100% vertical landing mode. The Harrier is famous for having littered the ocean floor with un-spent bombs,and having to dump fuel before a return landing on a ship. With the F35, even 100% vertical payloads are very good (double the Harrier). And with rolling landings, then even higher return store payloads will be permitted. As a general rule, you match the fuel loads and bomb loads to EXACT the mission. However, with this setup, they can add extra fuel for more afterburner time, or more time on station, but if such fuel etc. is not used, then they can return the F35 to the ship without having to dump expensive weapons.Keep in mind that 5,000 lbs is a great return store rating. A legacy F18 on a super-carrier is only rated for 4,000 lbs. So they face the same issue in terms of limiting fuel and weapons on a return ship landing. The new super Hornets fixed this huge shortcoming of the original F18. So the return store rating for a Super Hornet is in the 8,000 lbs range now.As the above video shows? Really easy - a walk in the part to land this way. However, with wind, rain, and large return payloads, slippery decks? Well, it may well that depending on how bad the weather is, they may well have to return back to the 100% hover over the deck and land mode. So a rolling landing is a great idea, as it increases return store loads, reduces hover time (increases rate of returning fighters).so this idea was not really used with Harriers, but with better brakes, larger decks, and a computer stabilized jet like the F35 B, this type of landing process will be part of regular operations on the HMS Q. I would like to see how well this works in a real storm and rain scenario, but it is a workable concept now.",4 followers,Mike Milne,987,117,878.1K,https://www.quora.com/Is-Lex-Luthor-smarter-than-Batman

And an extra 300 feet of runway means that the jet can have a larger fuel load, and larger weapons loads. As it rolls down the runway, the wings start to produce significant lift. Not enough to fly, but with the thrust of the jet pointing down to the ground, both together provide enough lift to fly.And the length of the run-up to the ramp is based on your current fuel and weapons loads. You ONLY use the amount of runway based on payloads for a ramp.The F35 B is SO VERY stunning in its short takeoff and has such huge payloads and is VERY airworthy in this mode.Well, here is a lightly loaded F35 using a ramp:(Again time stamped for the start – only 15 seconds of you time to watch)It almost funny, since the F35 B floats up and away like a hot air balloon! It’s not even trying or breaking out a sweat in the above. But, if you load up with huge fuel and weapons, then the amount of runway used would significantly increase. It almost comical to watch the above. The F35 just floats away.As pointed out, even on ships without a ramp, they still use a rolling takeoff to increase weapons and fuel loads to a “practical” amount.While the F35 can take off 100% vertical, it can only do so with a very limited fuel and weapons load. The load is so low, that the result is you can NOT use the jet for a practical and useful missions.So the F35 B, or the Harrier as a general rule use a rolling takeoff. And if you have a ramp, then you can enjoy even larger fuel and payloads at takeoff time.The F35 is rated about double the Harrier for 100% vertical landings, and has about 5,000 lbs of fuel (or fuel + weapons) in this mode. So it is “close” to actually having useful payloads in 100% vertical takeoff mode. But with a ramp, you going to get well beyond 10,000 lbs of payloads, and that means the jet can achieve a useful mission with decent range and weapons.",628 followers,Dominik Schachtsiek,1K,3.3K,4.4M,https://www.quora.com/Is-Lex-Luthor-smarter-than-Batman
