Furthermore, with this evident disrespect of proper practice and mastery he will never master anything.","50,650 followers",Håkon Hapnes Strand,24.7K,4.4K,85.5M,https://www.quora.com/What-do-you-think-about-Carlsens-game-against-a-guy-who-is-a-prodigy-at-learning-things-and-tried-to-teach-himself-to-win-in-30-days

I’m not sure which is worse, the dude who had the insane hubris to try this or the journalist who wrote this absurd article. But it’s probably the dude.Chess is, uhh, really hard. And Magnus is…really good. It took him a decade to get to be this good, starting from when he was a child chess prodigy. It’s not something you can just waltz in and destroy with a month of work. Progress is slow, time-consuming, and hard-earned (even for Magnus). So right off the bat we know this isn’t going to work.A month later, he plays Magnus and he gets destroyed. As we’d expect. He doesn’t even put up a fight; he blunders immediately out of the opening and basically instantly loses. Even I would last longer than that in this game (and even I could destroy this dude at chess, for that matter—from his game he’s probably like 1000-strength or so).So, yeah. Guy tries to do impossible thing and completely fails. Remind me why this is in the newspaper? “Area Man Loses To Chess World Champion”? I volunteer to lose to Magnus, anyone want to write an insane profile about me?There’s an extra dimension of terrible in this when we find out that he was gonna train some massive ML model and then memorize the thing. And the article makes out as though this was gonna work and the only reason he lost was because he didn’t have time to finish.I was so irritated by this whole business that I just went and looked up a post he wrote on Medium about it, and it seems he was trying to build a neural network to compute the evaluation of a given position. This is pretty useless, since after a ton of mental arithmetic all you know is roughly how good the position is. So what? That doesn’t tell you anything about what move to make.This wouldn’t have worked even if he had finished training and memorizing it, which both this guy and the author of the article would know if they talked to literally anyone who knew anything about the problem space. Even if he ran this on a computer (instead of a brain) it’s not clear that he could’ve turned this into a super-GM level chess engine. I won’t go into too much detail, but basically chess has a lot of structure where the presence of a single move 6 moves into a variation could completely change the evaluation of a move in the current position, and it’s not easy to capture these subtle nuances.To put it one way: there are a lot of moves which “look” good but turn out to be bad (or vice versa) because of some subtle concrete detail of the position, and we should expect it to be pretty challenging for a machine to grasp the distinction without doing any analysis of variations (explicitly or implicitly).There’s no machine learning based chess engine that can beat top humans right now, and if this guy managed to create one in a month that’d be pretty impressive, especially one that can be evaluated by humans. But we should expect this to be basically impossible too for a lay person.It’s also a little backwards: you’re ignoring the thing that humans are really good at (pattern recognition) to try to purely do something humans are pretty bad at (calculation).The second paragraph of this article is choice:> Max was not very good at chess himself. He’s a 24-year-old entrepreneur who lives in San Francisco and plays the sport occasionally to amuse himself. He was a prototypical amateur. Now he was preparing himself for a match against chess royalty. And he believed he could win.He’s an entrepreneur who lives in SF. Because of course. This is the kind of dumb bullshit that takes a professional bullshitter to come up with, and for that you need to head to the heartland of Bullshit County, USA: the Entrepreneur zone of San Francisco.This article pushes a lot of my buttons:* Shitty PR piece for this random dude who’s done ...","50,650 followers",Håkon Hapnes Strand,853,4.4K,85.5M,https://www.quora.com/What-do-you-think-about-Carlsens-game-against-a-guy-who-is-a-prodigy-at-learning-things-and-tried-to-teach-himself-to-win-in-30-days

At memory games he was always unbeatable.As a young teenager (I think he might have been 13), Magnus appeared on national television in the office of Grandmaster Simen Agdestein, the former number one in Norway. The walls in Agdestein’s office were covered with chess books. The GM, who was sort of his coach at one point, pulled down a random book from the shelves, opened it up on a random page and held up a diagram, while covering all the text. Magnus hesitated for a moment, but then went on to provide the names of both the players who had played the game in the diagram as well as the year it was played and the tournament venue. He repeated this trick a few times and was spot on every time. We’re talking games that were played by Soviet players decades before Magnus was even born. And he knew them all.His friend and second, GM Jon Ludvig Hammer, asked Magnus to reenact this stunt in adulthood, when training for his world championship match with Anand. I think there’s a YouTube video of it somewhere. Like I said, if his memory has worsened, it’s still quite insane.Of course, he performs the usual grandmaster party tricks of simultaneous displays and blindfold exhibitions, but he takes it a step further. Among his feats are beating 10 players while blindfolded and 3 players blindfoldedWhen Magnus is home in Norway, he sometimes shows up to tournaments, kibitzing on games. Discussing my own games with him can be rather humiliating, as he usually has better recollection of them than I do myself! And that’s after casually strolling past all boards in the tournament.I’ve met my fair share of smart people, but never anyone with a memory like that.","50,650 followers",Håkon Hapnes Strand,726,4.4K,85.5M,https://www.quora.com/What-do-you-think-about-Carlsens-game-against-a-guy-who-is-a-prodigy-at-learning-things-and-tried-to-teach-himself-to-win-in-30-days

What do you say to that?” Kasparov answered, “It isn’t conceited if it is the truth.” Wow, I thought, this guy makes Bobby Fischer seem almost humble. But perhaps that is what drove Kasparov to achieve what he did in the chess world. In 2007, Kasparov ran for the presidency of Russia, based more on his ego and celebrity than any actual experience for the job. Mr. Kasparov definitely doesn’t come across as humble in his autobiography, either.There certainly have been humble world champions. Jose Raul Capablanca, Boris Spassky and Magnus Carlsen come to mind. But for players such as Kasparov, Fischer and Alexander Alekhine, that inflated ego was likely necessary for them to successfully compete at the highest level of chess competitions.I have no idea what Garry Kasparov is like these days.

Especially chess. You think you’re competitive? Think again. That guy absolutely despises losing. Not because he’s playing against Karjakin in particular, but because he strives to be the best every time. Whenever Magnus loses just a single game of chess, his entire world collapses until he wins again. In his mind, it’s never OK to lose. Not even once. This isn’t out of disrespect to his opponents. It’s simply because he’s so hard on himself.Magnus is actually a very nice guy. He’s totally down-to-earth and humble. Surprisingly humble, in fact, considering the things he’s achieved. The person you saw at the press conference was not really Magnus Carlsen. That only represents a tiny, tiny fraction of his personality. In particular, the fraction that gets invoked whenever he loses a world championship game. It’s only really happened twice. The other time was when he lost to Ivanchuk in the candidates tournament in 2013.The other thing is that this is chess. It’s not like any other sport. The loss against Karjakin was such a monumental moment of failure. It’s almost comparable to Usain Bolt falling and finishing last in the 100 meter final in the olympics. Or Cristiano Ronaldo missing a decisive penalty in a world cup final. Except that it’s even worse. If Magnus loses this match it’s going to be remembered for hundreds of years. Magnus will be remembered as the guy who could have been the greatest of all time, but lost. This is the story of his life. It’s such an epic moment, and he failed.

Play against a weak enough player and the points you gain from a win are less than the points you lose for a draw.Magnus is the highest rated player in the world (the highest rated player ever; except 2014 Magnus…)This means that unless he wins more games than he draws, and unless he wins all games against players rated below a certain limit, he'll lose points. He might even win tournaments and still lose rating.Halfway through Grenke 2019 he was in the lead, yet his rating was unchanged after two wins and three draws. The only thing that boosted his rating in the end was him wrapping up the tournament with a brilliant 4 continuous wins.The only games in recent memory where draws didn't cost him points were the WC 2018, when Caruana's rating was close enough to Magnus's that neither of their ratings changed due to draws.It's a rather tough situation. Magnus has now played over 50 games in a row without a loss yet “only” gained 30:ish rating points.To realistically reach 2900 he needs to play only super tournaments (Norway is gonna be an expensive tournament for him in terms of rating), and perform over 2900 in all of them. That's a tall order. He's won all 3 tournaments so far this year with a performance over 2900 though, so he's clearly capable of it.But as his rating goes up the progress is slowed down.Can he do it? He'll need a close to perfect score in Norway, which is a tournament where he historically have had a rather lackluster performance; he also admitted in an interview at Grenke that he has issues playing against players that he rarely has played before.Edit: seems Norway worked out just fine, but Sinquefield cost him lots even though he won 2 and drew the rest.","50,650 followers",Håkon Hapnes Strand,530,4.4K,85.5M,https://www.quora.com/What-do-you-think-about-Carlsens-game-against-a-guy-who-is-a-prodigy-at-learning-things-and-tried-to-teach-himself-to-win-in-30-days

25,"So! You want to scavenge and collect a couple of missing nuclear weapons, do you?Lost or unaccounted nuclear weaponsSo! You want to scavenge and collect a couple of missing nuclear weapons, do you?Lost or unaccounted nuclear weaponsWell, sorry to burst your bubble. But it’s not going to be easy. In fact, considering that the nuclear superpowers that were initially responsible for losing these missing bombs in the first place have been working to recover them for a long while now with mixed success, it’d probably just be easier toBut regardless of the practical, lets go over the possible, just for the fun of it. After all, missing nuclear weapons are occasionally recovered. The following is a list of1968 Thule Air Base B-52 crash. (~0.5 Nukes Lost)(B-52 gunner rescued in Greenland after ejecting over North Star Bay)On January 21st, 1968, during the ongoing operation Chrome-Dome, a cabin fire in a B-52 bomber forced the crew to abandon their craft over North Star Bay, Greenland. Six of the seven crew members ejected safely and survived, before the bomber crashed into the icy sea of the Arctic circle.The craft had been armed with four B-28 thermonuclear bombs, each with a yield of 1.1 megatons. Upon impact, three of the warhead’s conventional explosives detonated, scattering the debris, and creating the effect of a “dirty bomb,” with high levels of radioactive contamination.American and Danish officials immediately launched1989 Sinking of Soviet K-278On April 7th, 1989, a fire erupted on board the soviet K-278 submarine, due to short circuiting issues. Despite distress signals and rapid response time, the rough seas and inadequate escape capsules lead to the fatalities of 42 of the 69 crewmen by the time the rescue was complete.Along with the fatalities, the K-278 carried with it two RPK-2 “Vyuga” nuclear-tipped anti-submarine torpedoes. While a search revealed the location of the craft two months after the accident, authorities deemed it impractical and dangerous to retrieve the nuclear material. An expedition in 1994 revealed a plutonium leakage from one of the eroding torpedo doors, which lead Russian authorities to launch an expedition to seal the hatch. A recording of radiation levels in 1996 deemed that the leakage would be considered negligible until 2025, when the warhead’s radioactive levels would be rendered harmless. This means, off the North coast of Norway, there lies one dormant but functional nuclear torpedo, encased in its submarine, under the watchful eye of the Russian government.(Observation probe being lowered into the ocean, directly above the K-278)1968 Sinking of USS Scorpion (SSN-589). (2 Nukes “Lost”)In June of 1968, the USS Scorpion nuclear submarine came up as six days overdue for its correspondence with Norfolk, Virginia. After five months of searching, its remains were found at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean, a few hundred miles southwest of Azores, about 9,800 ft underwater. The entire crew of 99 has perished.Controversy surrounds the ultimate cause of sinking in what some have called one of the big four mysterious cases of a missing submarine in 1968. According to the United States, the most likely cause of the damage was a misfire of one of its own conventional torpedoes. When its remains were located, the submarine had split entirely in two under the overwhelming underwater pressure.However, upon further inspection, the only damage done to the nuclear torpedo room appeared to be a hatch missing from the forward escape trunk. With monitored exterior radiation levels remaining completely normal, there would appear to be no leakage, which would indicate that the two Mk 45 torpedoes, each with a 11 kiloton W34 nuclear warhead, remain entirely intact.(The sunken remains of the bow, containing two intact nuclear warheads)1958 Tybee Island Mid-Air Collision Incident (~1 Nuke Lost)(Visible Damage to the B-47B from the collision)On February 5th, 1958, during a training exercise off the coast of Georgia, involving an F-86 Sabre and a B-47 bomber, disaster struck. Due to a fatal error, the fighter pilot was forced to make an ejection, and the empty F-86 drifted into a mid-air collision with the B-47, which carried a Mk 15 thermonuclear bomb. As the crew of the bomber struggled to regain control, they requested (and were granted) permission to jettison the unarmed payload into the ocean at 7,200 feet up. Upon being dropped into the water, the bomb’s conventional explosives failed to detonate, and it sank to the bottom of the waters.After the B-47 made a safe landing and the fighter pilot was recovered, questions began arising. According to the Air Force, the nuclear capsule was removed before the training exercises. However, in 1966, the Assistant Secretary of Defense clarified that the payload was indeed a fully functional weapon, with a yield of 3.8 megatons.(Mk 15 thermonuclear bomb, identical to the one lost)An exhaustive and ongoing search of the area has yielded no results whatsoever. According to a hydrologic survey from the Department of Energy, the bomb is thought to currently be preserved under 5–15 feet of silt at the bottom of the ocean.1965 Philippine Sea A-4 incident (1 Nuke Lost)(Image of A-4 Skyhawk aboard the USS Ticonderoga)On December 5th, 1965, during a training exercise aboard theThe news was only shared openly in 1989, to a great deal of (understandable) outrage on behalf of the Japanese government. The bomb was outfitted to carry anywhere from 70 kilotons to 1 megaton of explosives, and rests somewhere around 16,000 ft under the surface of the sea.1970 Sinking of Soviet K-8 Submarine (4 Nukes Lost)On April 12th, 1970, a fire broke out on the Soviet K-8 nuclear submarine, during a naval exercise in the Bay of Biscay. The submarine managed to successfully resurface, and the captain ordered his crew to abandon ship. However, a towing vessel arrived, and got to work on towing the submarine to shore.Nonetheless, the crippled state of the submarine led it to sinking, resulting in the ultimate deaths of 52 crew members. Details remain extremely secretive, but it is claimed that four out of twenty four unspecified nuclear torpedoes remained onboard are in functional condition, and now rest with the remains of the craft at 15,350 ft underwater, about 260 miles northwest of Spain.1986 Sinking of Soviet K-219 Submarine (34 Nukes Lost)I’ve saved the best for last. The sinking of the K-219 submarine remains to this day perhaps the most mysterious and controversial submarine incidence during the entire cold war.On October 3rd, 1986, the Soviet K-219 experienced an explosion and subsequent fire in one of its missile tubes. Two of the crew members were killed immediately by the explosion, with another killed subsequently from toxic gas poisoning. One final crew member, Sergei Preminin, perished while successfully shutting down the nuclear reactor.The submarine resurfaced for long enough to evacuate the remaining crew members, but sunk to the bottom of the Abyssal plain, 18,000 ft below sea level,Now here’s where things get strange. In 1988, the Soviet research shipThe submarine was split in two from the underwater pressure. Several of the missile silo hatches had been forced open, with tool marks clearly visible. The submarine had been stocked with 16The Soviet Union held the claim that a collision with the USSSome believe that the United States is responsible for salvaging the weapons. Other people propose theories about a private organization collecting them.

My answer was pretty basic. When you’re reading something fantastic, you have an automatic disbelief, as you should when told things that you’re pretty damn sure are not true. But not simple “this didn’t happen” — you know you’re reading fiction — but “this could not happen”.The job of a science fiction writer is to suspend your disbelief. A common tool used for this is to take today’s science and extrapolate. There are, for example, spaceships inI pointed out thatWith fantasy, the suspension of disbelief is all on you! It’s not the author’s responsibility to give you any reason to believe. Magic works because it’s magic, dragons speak the King’s English because, well, what else would dragons speak, and of course witches and wizards can fly on brooms (they’re not “the help,” after all, why on earth else would they have brooms). And Superman doesn’t even need a broom to fly!And yes, this also means that it’s quite possible that, just as I dubbed Star Wars “fantasy with science fiction elements,” you can have “science fiction with fantasy elements” …For example, you can have aAnd that’s rather necessary. When there’s big unexplained magic in a story, you can’t really use it very much. Tolkien gives us super powerful wizards… or at least we think they’re powerful. Gandalf vanquished the Balrog… off-camera, essentially. He called Eagles to rescue Sam and Frodo from Mt. Doom after the One Ring had been destroyed, but he didn’t magic them there in the first place, orSo small magic, based on a presented technology, used as a tool, might not necessarily be fantasy at all. This brings me straight to Clarke’s Third Law: “Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.” As a species, we were developing technology and learning its basic rules long before we understood how it all works… assuming we do even now. In the real world, humans were developing technology by-rote: chemistry, metallurgy, medicine, etc. before really understanding how it all worked.

If the “magic” in our story changes for some reason, then it better be due to a “technological development,” and there better be a reason, moving forward, for that particular rule to change.A lot of fans got really upset with the recent Star Wars films for “breaking” it’s own rules on how it’s technology works. In only one notable instance did they call it out as a “development” when the broke their own established rules, but they kept doing it, and the fans didn’t like it. You can’t have consistent rules for your technology for six films and then suddenly start throwing all that away just for the shock value.
