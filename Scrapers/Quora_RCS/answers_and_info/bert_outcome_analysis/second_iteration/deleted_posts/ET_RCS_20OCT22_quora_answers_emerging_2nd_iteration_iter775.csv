Humans are now powerful enough to consider planet-scale engineering. The thing is that technology is evolving faster and faster everyday, eventually leading us to aToday, most people are not aware of all these things. They think it belongs to the realm of science-fiction. Some of them do, because they're simply not interesting in terms of engineering. But if the time is given to humanity, almost everything will be possible. Serious scientists think that humans, in few centuries, would be considered as gods-like by people like us.

So then I realized it would take far too many to make much of a difference.Some talk of slinging asteroids or comets at Mars. This would likely work well, though there's a world of difference between the two. Asteroids could be nudged, like pushing a moving car. A comet is more like nudging a bullet (coming towards you). They are moving very very fast, and not in a similar orbit to the planets.The short answer is Elon Musk is not crazy.

This is how Elon Musk explained the idea:“Nuke Mars refers to a continuous stream of very low fallout nuclear fusion explosions above the atmosphere to create artificial suns. Much like our sun, this would not cause Mars to become radioactive… Not risky imo & can be adjusted/improved real-time. Essentially need to figure out most effective way to convert mass to energy, as Mars is slightly too far from this solar system's fusion reactor (the sun).”In order to terraform Mars, we need to make the planet warmer and create a stronger atmosphere. Basically we need to start global warming on Mars. It’s bad for Earth, but good for Mars.Technically there is no evidence to suggest that nuking Mars is a good or bad idea or what potential side-affects would be. Since terraforming Mars would make it easier to colonize, the option of nuking it should be considered.Like many of his ideas, terraforming Mars is kind of unrealistic. For example, he claims that we will have a million people on Mars by 2050 when the absolute best case scenario is a few thousand based on how many Starships he would need in order to get that many people over there in the first place. If we are going to completly terraform Mars, it will be because of multiple ideas and potentially take decades or even centuries.To everyone reading - thanks and have a wonderful day!",3 followers,Steve Baker,3.2K,27.3K,162.4M,https://www.quora.com/When-billionaires-build-laser-weapons-from-space-and-talk-about-nuking-mars-to-terraform-it-has-Elon-musk-lost-his-mind

4,"What is the science being Elon Musk's idea of terraforming Mars by nuking it?Mars is so cold that atmospheric CO2 actually freezes out into a solid at the poles. The Martian atmosphere is composed of 25 trillion tonnes of mostly CO2 (95%), and the polar regions store something like 3 to 4 trillion tonnes of dry ice. This means that if you could warm up the polar regions enough, you would liberate this CO2 which would bulk up the atmosphere by 12 to 16%. Such a change would greatly assist in improving the conditions required for liquid water on the surface which is only possible presently on aWhat is the science being Elon Musk's idea of terraforming Mars by nuking it?Mars is so cold that atmospheric CO2 actually freezes out into a solid at the poles.

This means that if you could warm up the polar regions enough, you would liberate this CO2 which would bulk up the atmosphere by 12 to 16%. Such a change would greatly assist in improving the conditions required for liquid water on the surface which is only possible presently on a summer’s midday at the equator.The idea proposed by Musk is to detonate nuclear weapons at the polar regions and start melting the frozen CO2. This would start a feedback loop where increased CO2 in the atmosphere increases the greenhouse effect, raising temperatures which in turn leads to more melting of both the dry ice and water ice. The problems with this plan, radiation issues aside, is the fact that the energy input required to start the process is enormous and many thousands of bombs would be required for the task.There are other possible solutions other than transporting millions of tonnes of bombs from the Earth (which from a different perspective doesn’t sound too bad at all). You could provide an energy source to do the job in the form of orbital mirrors that could redirect otherwise wasted solar energy onto the Martian surface. This has the additional benefits of not just being “cleaner”, but also being an ongoing process that will continue to deliver much needed heat to the planet for as long as you continue to hold them in position. The logistics of constructing these gigantic mirrors are similar to transporting thousands of bombs, but the effect is much more long lasting.Other possibilities are redirecting Jupiter family comets such asEven the introduction of a comet the size of 67P would not be enough on its own, and many more examples would be required which is possible since there is estimated to be around 300 Jupiter family comets larger than 2km in diameter.Regardless of whatever technique, or combination of techniques you adopt, you are committed to undergoing a task whose scale has never before been attempted.","8,614 followers",Abdullah Shiryar,9.2K,182,7.5M,https://www.quora.com/When-billionaires-build-laser-weapons-from-space-and-talk-about-nuking-mars-to-terraform-it-has-Elon-musk-lost-his-mind
5,"He thinks (incorrectly, IMHO) that he can use nuclear bombs to melt the Martian ice caps (which are mostly CO2 ice) - which would push the atmospheric pressure up - which would kick in the greenhouse effect - which would warm the planet - which would melt the ice.Then he could dump some algae into the water and convert all of the CO2 into oxygen and we’d have a livable planet.There are at least four or five things wrong with that.He thinks (incorrectly, IMHO) that he can use nuclear bombs to melt the Martian ice caps (which are mostly CO2 ice) - which would push the atmospheric pressure up - which would kick in the greenhouse effect - which would warm the planet - which would melt the ice.Then he could dump some algae into the water and convert all of the CO2 into oxygen and we’d have a livable planet.There are at least four or five things wrong with that.So I don’t think his plan has a chance in hell of working.",401 followers,Roshan Thomas,8.5K,0,0,https://www.quora.com/When-billionaires-build-laser-weapons-from-space-and-talk-about-nuking-mars-to-terraform-it-has-Elon-musk-lost-his-mind

All of the jobs I have listed can be accomplished by a cross section of physically people within a very broad range, but everyone if them have to be smart and quick witted.Now we have Security and Maintenance functions that require people to be appropriately fit, but little more than their civilian counterparts. In fact the vast majority of our depot level operations are conducted by Department of the Air Force civilian employees. As are most of our facility maintenance workers on AF Bases. Even our security forces on Stateside Bases is sometimes civilian DAF personnel. These civilians don’t have to meet any physical fitness requirements as long as they can do their jobs.We do have Combat Controller teams, Pararescue Jumpers (PJ's), Combat Divers, and Combat Weatherman that are Tier One combat forces that are among the fittest troops in the world, bar none. In all services competitions the Air Force teams win more than any other branch.Now we do have maintenance personnel also, they have to be fairly physical fit as well as very smart. Fixing 4++ and 5th generation fighter aircraft on a hot/cold runway can be miserable. If you are in a combat region you are also a very easy target for snipers. (We have our own, very fit snipers, to take out enemy snipers taking shots.)In the Air Force we only need a very few individuals that can climb a mountain with full battle rattle and a 80 pound pack on their backs, or jump out of aircraft with even more weight to carry. But even those physically demanding career fields also demand very smart folks, in fact they have to be very smart.The Air Force engages at distances meassured in miles not yards, and hundreds and even in excess of 10,000 miles with very precise offensive weapons capable of almost pin point accuracy. We pride ourselves on being able to do the majority of our fighting from Beyond Visual Range. At ranges we are not even seen on RADAR at. We do have A-10 pilots that will get right down almost in the dirt with their aircraft in a Close Air Support mission, if needed.Do you want a smart troop working on nukes and 2 Billion dollar aircraft, or one that it very physically fit?

It can be broken down into a list of things to prepare. I’m sharing the list below that helped me land multiple Data Scientist offers from top tier companies like1. SQLSQL is a practical skill that you will use frequently in your day to day job as a data scientist. No matter whether you work at a small company or a big company, SQL is one of the tools you will use consistently as a data scientist.You will expect SQL questions in more than 1 stage of the interview loop, including SQL challenge, the technical phone screen and onsite interview. The typical length is 45 min to 1 hour.For preparation, there is no other way than practice. There are a lot of online practicing resources such as LeetCode and HackerRank. After finishing each question, make sure to check the discussions and compare with other people’s answers that you could discover more concise and efficient answers.2. Product Metric QuestionsProduct metric is another important type of question. Lots of people find it very hard to prepare for such questions due to lack of working experience. However, it’s completely possible to prepare for this kind of question.For product sense/metrics problems, you need to read sample Q&A’s and organize them into categories and frameworks. I would highly recommend checking out the blog by Stellar Peers and reading the books such as “Cracking the PM Interview”. The frameworks will give you a general guideline of ideas to consider and how to structure the answers. In real interviews, however, you need to communicate with the interviewer and adjust the framework to the specific problem.If you are interested, I have a couple of Youtube videos about how to answer metrics questions under my3. Statistics and probabilityStatistics and probability questions will be asked on the technical phone screen and onsite interviewers for assessing your basic knowledge. The interview questions will be formulated in terms of conceptual questions, whiteboard calculations and coding.To prepare for conceptual and whiteboard questions, if you have taken statistics classes in the university, it’s necessary to review all the materials. A Practical Guide To Quantitative Finance Interviews is a great book that has a lot of probability related problems. To prepare for coding questions, LeetCode and HackerRank would be the best place to find probability related coding questions.4. Behavior questionsBehavioral questions are extremely important in Data Science interviews. You may get questions such as “How did you handle a difficult situation?”, “How did you handle conflict?”, “What would you do when your teammate doesn’t perform well?”To prepare for behavioral questions, you need to prepare stories telling how you are dealing with different scenarios. When answering behavioral questions, particularly situation type of questions, the framework to follow is: 1. What was the story? 2. What did you do? 3. What was the outcome?Make sure you come up with a couple of well-thought-out before the interviews. Make sure you practice telling the stories, speak it out aloud, because you will only know if it works by doing so.",21 followers,William Chen,960,930,28.8M,https://www.quora.com/When-billionaires-build-laser-weapons-from-space-and-talk-about-nuking-mars-to-terraform-it-has-Elon-musk-lost-his-mind
