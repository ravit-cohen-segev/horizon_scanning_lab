Before going on, the views represented in this piece are not my own, but the best attempt I could make of rationalizing the different and competing ideological groups composing the Alt Right and communicating them in a way that others could better understandFirst off, I am not Alt Right. Those who follow my writing will see that clearly as I explain the different factions that exist within them. Before going on, the views represented in this piece are not my own, but the best attempt I could make of rationalizing the different and competing ideological groups composing the Alt Right and communicating them in a way that others could better understand the Alt Right as a whole.That said, my ultimate goal in writing this is to make people aware of the Alt Right as more than just the White Nationalists. There are many such individuals, but what I want is for common knowledge to exist about them so that the rest of us can parse the Alt Right, find common ground with the parts that most of us can agree with, reintegrate those factions back into mainstream political discussions, and eventually isolate out the White Nationalist factions, leaving them to wither on the vine absent a future source to recruit members and support from. I‚Äôm not Alt Right, but what I see in them is a very large and diverse group with some factions having valid arguments, and a very small group with radically terrible ideas. I‚Äôm concerned the overgeneralization of them, however, is playing into the hands of their worst elements in an effort to fundamentalize the entire movement. This is an identical process that I have communicated before with such radicalizing groups, and I see the trend as dangerous and damaging to the future of our country if we don‚Äôt make the right choices now in defeating it. Part of that process is information. For that reason, this answer will primarily be about communicating the views of the different factions within the Alt Right as best I can decipher. Parts will be uncomfortable to read, but know that they were equally difficult to research and write, in fact more so.In ‚ÄúWhat are some effective ways for an individual to contribute to dismantling of the alt-right? [ https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-effective-ways-for-an-individual-to-contribute-to-dismantling-of-the-alt-right/answer/Joshua-Alexander-356 ]‚Äù I will explain how I believe they can be dismantled and re-incorporated into mainstream politics, isolating out the White Nationalist faction. To follow my series on Understanding and Dismantling the Alt-Right [ https://warelephant.quora.com/Announcing-My-New-Session-Understanding-and-Dismantling-the-Alt-Right ] follow War Elephant [ https://warelephant.quora.com/ ] or on Facebook at War Elephant [ https://www.facebook.com/warelephantmedia/ ].Let‚Äôs begin by examining the following image, because it pretty much explains everything you need to know about the Alt Right. It‚Äôs messy, it‚Äôs confusing, it‚Äôs convoluted, it‚Äôs weird, and there are parts that scare us into thinking everything else in it is terrible. But the lines within it are important. This is the best way I could break up the competing ideologies in the Alt Right, not to be representative of the relative sizes of each ideology, but of the ideologies that make them up.General Commonalities ‚Äî Disestablishmentarianism and PopulismThe only thing I‚Äôve found that seems common to all of the Alt Right is evident in the name. First, while they have a general resentment of the Left and its specific policies, the alternative Right was formed in response to what it viewed as ‚Äúestablishment‚Äù Right‚Äôs inability to act in what many of the Alt Right believed to be their interests or act in accordance with their stated principles. Which principles take priority differs from one group to another, but in general, they view the establishment as compromising too many of their principles in regard to either placating the Left or to big business interests as a requirement of playing the game.Many were driven to the Alt Right as a result of the Presidency of George W. Bush, as they believed that the Neoconservative agenda was one that sought too many accommodations with the Democrats and shifted the country Leftward, while also entangling the world in what they viewed as unnecessary wars without focusing on the needs of the American culture. The Presidency of Barack Obama also saw numerous social changes that many in the Alt Right felt were direct attacks on their culture or their way of life.For this reason, while still vehemently disagreeing with the Left, they disagreed with the way in which the Right represented itself, thereby in their mind necessitating a break from the ‚Äúold‚Äù Right or Establishment Right. Seeing little chance to see real reforms done by the establishment Right, they joined the alternative one. In this thinking, they share a major vein with many who view the modern establishment Republicans, as well as Establishment Democrats, to be unable to practice the values of their constituencies, but instead have sold out to corporatist mentalities and a desire to appease uncompromising political enemies.The general lack of confidence in the cultural cliques of government is a sentiment many are finding agreement with. It‚Äôs known historically as ‚ÄúDisestablishmentarianism‚Äù and has become a trend common in both the Right and Left, giving rise to the popular movements of today. Donald Trump was viewed as a completely foreign element to ‚Äúthe Establishment‚Äù, and in fact, the complete resentment he received from them, was an element he capitalized on in his bid for the Presidency, and continues to do so. Many people gravitate to his populist message in the belief that he will somehow be able to break-up the culture of government in Washington and ‚Äúreturn power to the people.‚Äù They believe that by ‚ÄúDraining the Swamp‚Äù they will restore the Right to some ideal it has lost, and thereby dealing a major defeat against the Left.The resentment of both Left leaning ideology and the ‚ÄúEstablished‚Äù Right, seem to be the only thing I see most of the Alt Right having in common. Beyond that they break up in many different ideologic sets, many competing ideologies, and a few that are mutually inconsistent with each other and which will be unable to exist together for long.The Free Speech Faction is the first group that draws most people into the Alt Right. They are advocates for free speech and against censorship in all forms. They are the people who will get up in arms whenever they feel that people are being unfairly treated for their views ‚Äî any views, even the ones that are objectively horrible. This is the faction of ‚ÄúI may disagree with what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it.‚ÄùThe Free Speech Faction is the first group that draws most people into the Alt Right.

This is the faction of ‚ÄúI may disagree with what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it.‚ÄùOne group that I saw that attended the event was a group saying they were part of the Patriot movement. Besides the video I am unaware of them, and by the looks of them, they looked like a bunch of bikers, but what they said was interesting. They said they didn‚Äôt agree with the racism or the BLM or the Antifa, but they were there to fight for Free Speech, and nothing else. I was unaware of such a group and particularly unaware of it in the biker community, but they said they traveled very far for the protest, and did not communicate about them an heir of prejudicial behavior. They communicated a sentiment I am familiar with of many people I know from the South, that they did not support racism, but were against the silencing of history and were fighting for its protection.This faction, including but not limited to those calling themselves the Patriot Movement is important to understand because they are still on the outer edges of the Alt Right, may not identify as Alt Right, and may not know that the community they are a part of is Alt Right. They just hear ‚ÄúFree Speech‚Äù and are like, ‚ÄúYeah, I‚Äôm down with that.‚Äù It is something most of us might do, having no other sources of information. The problem is that once they enter that community, cross pollination seeds them with the ideas more central to the circle, which can get pretty nasty (which I will discuss later).Civic Nationalism is a pride movement, but one celebrating nationalism that isn‚Äôt ethnic in nature. Civic Nationalist focuses on the ideals, values, institutions, and beliefs of a culture. For many of the Alt Right groups that have spawned internationally, Civic Nationalism is a reaction to a perceived attempt by modern Left-wing philosophy to blame Western Culture for all evils of history in an unfair representation of the objective good which such societies have brought. This, they refer to as ‚Äúglobalism.‚Äù Some would describe globalism as the need for Western culture to correct its numerous and systematic injustices against the world by importing other cultures into it. The argument is to say that globalism‚Äôs basic assumption is that there is something flawed in Western culture and the only way to correct that flaw is to replace it with other cultures and ideas contradictory to the values of Western Culture. To many, this feels like an attack on their values, since often, it really doesn‚Äôt matter the actual cultural traits which are being important and what potential value they might have, so long as they new, different and exotic. This implies to Civic Nationalist‚Äôs that their value systems are thereby patently inferior to all others and in need of replacement by the Left.Civic Nationalism is a pride movement, but one celebrating nationalism that isn‚Äôt ethnic in nature.

This implies to Civic Nationalist‚Äôs that their value systems are thereby patently inferior to all others and in need of replacement by the Left.For this reason, the concept of Civic Nationalism arose as a system of apologetical arguments to defend Western Civilization, it‚Äôs values, and its institutions. Each nation‚Äôs Alt Right may focus primarily on the virtues of that particular nation, but many Civic Nationals find a great deal of common ground with one another in the acknowledgement that the unifying ‚ÄúWestern Culture‚Äù is a cross pollination of ideas from many nations over the course of centuries.What differentiates this group from ethnic nationalists, such as the neo-Nazis and the KKK, is that they really don‚Äôt care what race you are, so long as you believe in the ideals of Western civilization. A person who identifies themselves as ‚ÄúIndian by birth, American by choice‚Äù and seeks to adapt and acclimate to American culture, is someone very much appreciated by people who call themselves Civic Nationals.In a very, very large part, the modern Alt Right is a reaction to identity politics. Identity politics is where groups will seek to create a unified set of political doctrines based on one or multiple ways in which they view themselves. This includes Feminism, Black Rights, the LGBT, but also includes Military Veterans groups, and other such political activity groups built around status and advocate for change based on one unified stance on what is good for their whole group.In a very, very large part, the modern Alt Right is a reaction to identity politics.

This includes Feminism, Black Rights, the LGBT, but also includes Military Veterans groups, and other such political activity groups built around status and advocate for change based on one unified stance on what is good for their whole group.Where the Alt Right took issue with identity politics was that various Left leaning political action groups channeled resentment towards other identity groups they identified as oppressors, converging most often on white males. Essentially, in Left leaning circles including many Liberal cities, academia, and the media, it became normalized to casually mock white people and men, or universally hold them responsible for broad and generalized problems in society, as if these weren‚Äôt patently racist and sexist arguments. This became commonplace in Liberal circles for such identity groups to feel free to say hateful and disparaging things towards men, whites, straight people, or Christians, as they were perceived as having systemic privilege enough that such attacks were warranted and culturally encouraged. This became center stage not long before the time of this writing with the Google Memo by an engineer who spoke about the culture of Google being openly toxic to men, and his subsequent firing from the company. While obviously sexist and racist behaviors, the activists and those who agreed with them were justified as it was believed a person could not practice racism or sexism, or other such behaviors because they systematically lacked power due to the oppression of these groups, and therefore could not act on the resentment they held, even when what they were saying and doing would never be acceptable if the roles were reversed.One case in point - F*** you, you filthy white f****!'  [ http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3321190/F-filthy-white-s-Black-Lives-Matter-protesters-scream-epithets-white-students-studying-Dartmouth-library.html ]- protesters hurl abuse at white students at Dartmouth [ http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3321190/F-filthy-white-s-Black-Lives-Matter-protesters-scream-epithets-white-students-studying-Dartmouth-library.html ]This ‚Äúpunching up‚Äù, left many whites and men, as well as the others feeling frustrated and without representation, as if the act of representing themselves itself was a criminal offense, since their privilege nullified their arguments. This angered many, but rather than abandoning or arguing against the concept of identity politics, many took the natural reaction to form identity groups themselves. Feeling unable to of doing so outside of the public debates, they did so in close off online circles where they networked with others. The argument was that if you need to form identity activism groups to defend your rights, then whites, men, and others needed to form them too. To quote one Alt Right leader, Jared Taylor ‚Äúwhite identity‚Äù in particular as defined as ‚Äúa recognition by whites that they have interests in common that must be defended. All other racial groups take this for granted, that it‚Äôs necessary to band together along racial lines to work together for common interests.‚ÄùWe have to talk about trolls.We have to talk about trolls.Trolls are people who are master provocateurs. They know how to say the right things that will cause the reaction in others that they want. They are like evil psychologists.Trolls function in mostly online forums of the internet living out their fantasies through the act of taking joy in angering others. They are fully aware of social norms and values, and actively seek to break taboos for fun. They say the most hateful things imaginable, but don‚Äôt actually believe anything they say. They are just trolling you.That said, the most dangerous thing about them is that they don‚Äôt believe anything they say. They might spout out something profound, only to say something enraging and hateful the next. They didn‚Äôt mean either of them. They just took delight in the reaction it caused in others. It really is a game. That‚Äôs dangerous because when you go into these groups, you can‚Äôt know if you are dealing with something that is actually real commentary or someone using incendiary language to pull others into a fight.What makes this group important is that they know how to get attention. They literally share psychology notes, tactics, and techniques to get as much attention to their troll as is humanly possible without getting caught. Being that they don‚Äôt actually believe most of what they say, they serve as great sources of gaslighting any group the media feels they represent. Their adolescent hate speech appears in the comments section of virtually every web page and this is then used to paint everyone from the Alt Right, Trump Supporters, Conservatives, Republicans, and even many groups on the Left, as hateful people.They are the internet‚Äôs stage 4 cancer.Whether we are talking about Neo-Nazis, the KKK, White Supremacists, or whatever, we can simply call them White Nationalists.Whether we are talking about Neo-Nazis, the KKK, White Supremacists, or whatever, we can simply call them White Nationalists.Modern White Nationalism came from a series of ethnic movements which began following WWII. We can argue that the KKK existed well before that, which functioned as both a white identity politics faction and a white supremacist group, but most of the justifications for ethnic nationhood that people fall back on today came about after the war. That war created the argument that the Jewish people needed a homeland to call their own which could advocate for them with the international community and provide a place of refuge to escape the historical pogroms and holocaust that dotted their history. I agree with that, by the way, but others used the same idea to make ethnic nationalist movements of their own.Following this, other ethnic group...",UNKNOWN,Mike Jones,4K,25.1K,80.3M,https://www.quora.com/Should-various-communication-devices-be-allowed-during-the-examinations
