1,Not in the least. Programming languages are written do that both programmers and computers can understand what is written. Spaces in names may make it easier for a programmer to understand (or make it more difficult). But it will make it more difficult to implement a correct compiler.,18 followers,Asim Qureshi,2.9K,996,155.4M,https://www.quora.com/Are-satellite-CPUs-extremely-fast-in-part-because-of-the-extremely-low-Kelvin-measure

3,"Not really. I like it when it’s available, like in Algol 68—but Algol 68 lets you use one of several “stropping” techniques so it can distinguish language keywords from a piece of an identifier. Without that, you have the standard infamous Fortran “DO 100 I = 1.10” typo that silently turns what was intended to be the beginning of a DO loop into an assignment of 1.10 to a variable named DO100I.I’m happy to use underscores or CamelCase where needed.",95 followers,Kevin Hongtongsak,5.6K,0,0,https://www.quora.com/Does-it-bother-you-that-some-computer-languages-do-not-allow-for-spaces-in-function-names-whereas-others-do
4,"For the past 40+ years, it has been accepted that best practice in programming language design is to not allow spaces in any identifiers. It makes compilers easier (and faster!), but the bigger issue is that older languages had tendencies toward bugs. We’re hardly bug-free, but removing flexibility leads to fewer bugs, and it’s easier for students to understand and learn, as the rules are consistent. Adding a large set of rules for a rare case is usually not beneficial.","29,212 followers",Mattias Petter Johansson,1.9K,1.1K,16.1M,https://www.quora.com/Does-it-bother-you-that-some-computer-languages-do-not-allow-for-spaces-in-function-names-whereas-others-do
5,"This question really boils down to preference. I find it hard to believe that any language allows spaces in function names, I didn't know that it was a thing. Every developer has their own preference when it comes to naming things, some people like camel case or snake case and so on.

6,"Not only function names do not allow for spaces, many programming languages do not allow spaces in identifiers. Some exceptions such as 4D programming language allows white space in function names and variables.Spaces in function names are easy for us to read, but make compiler confusing.For example, in a JavaScript function:var obj={log: [a,b,c],get latest (){if (this.log.length==0) {return undefined} return this.log.length}If a function name allows whitespace, then it will be pretty confusing whether “get latest” is actually a function or “get“ is just a syntax that binds property “log” withNot only function names do not allow for spaces, many programming languages do not allow spaces in identifiers.

In JavaScript, the latter is true.In compiling, the parser will separate the sequence of input characters i.e. syntax of a computer program into separate tokens and build a parse tree for analysis. Tokens are identified by delimiters, regular expression etc. Whitespace is a special character used by lexers to identify and separate tokens due to their natural use in programmingIn the above example, the string “get latest ()”will be parsed as IDENTIFIER GET, IDENTIFIER LATEST, OPEN_PARENTHESIS, CLOSE_PARENTHEDIS. If the funnction name that you want is “getlatest”, then this parsing is incorrect.","1,819 followers",Panicz Godek,1K,261,1.9M,https://www.quora.com/Does-it-bother-you-that-some-computer-languages-do-not-allow-for-spaces-in-function-names-whereas-others-do

9,"Not at all. I am fine with using spaces to demarcate my tokens in the source code.I do remember that I liked about Scheme that I could use -, + and ? in my identifiers and that I could not in other languages. I was never happy with underscores to replace the spaces since I had to press the Shift key to get them, and using - this was not necessary in Scheme. Of course, you do pay a price, in that you are not allowed to write things like a+2 and instead have to write a + 2 (I know, in Scheme this would be + a 2, but I assume you get the idea).",3 followers,Steve Baker,874,27.3K,162.4M,https://www.quora.com/Does-it-bother-you-that-some-computer-languages-do-not-allow-for-spaces-in-function-names-whereas-others-do
10,"Not at all, I have never used a language that allowed spaces in identifiers directly (though Java may when using hex codes, I’m not sure).

11,"No, I am “old school.” Yingzi Li has an good answer as to why spaces in an identifier of any type might confuse the compiler. He has an excellent example in JavaScript about having a function name starting with the word “get” that can cause confusion. Whenever I program, I want everything to be as clear as possible, so I do not use any white space in my names. I also want the names to be as descriptive as possible. Therefore, I use underscores to connect the words or use CamelCase to emphasize each word.

At the conference, Mr. Zhang Ping'an, President of Huawei Consumer Cloud Service, delivered a keynote speech titled ""Soaring to Greater Heights, Together with HMS."" As he noted, the HMS ecosystem has achieved a place among the top 3 mobile app ecosystems in the world in the short space of just one year.Previously, HMS Core 5.0 had already been released globally. Since last year's HDC, the number of registered developers within the HMS ecosystem has increased from 0.91 million to 1.8 million, and the number of apps integrated with HMS Core has increased from 43,000 to 96,000, an increase of 123%.HMS Core 5.0 opens up more software, hardware, and cloud capabilities, covering seven major domains including the app services, graphics, AI, and system domains. These capabilities can help developers build better apps.Graphics: A More Vivid Graphics ExperienceIn the graphics domain, HMS Core 5.0 provides services like Computer Graphics Kit, Accelerate Kit, and Scene Kit, enabling developers to improve the efficiency of app development and build a better user experience.Computer Graphics Kit provides a high-performance rendering framework and a series of rendering plug-ins. It is an open capability system based on GPU technologies. After integrating Computer Graphics Kit, game apps can improve their average frame rate by 13-16% and reduce their average power consumption by 11-13%*, offering users a better overall experience.* Data source: Huawei labsBy integrating Computer Graphics Kit, REVELATION (a mobile game from NetEase) has been able to utilize device-side graphics algorithms like anti-aliasing, volumetric cloud, and image super-resolution to provide more immersive 3D graphics rendering effects for users.In addition to Computer Graphics Kit, Scene Kit in the graphics domain provides multiple scenario-based APIs, helping developers achieve exquisite rendering effects more efficiently. Accelerate Kit provides developers with easy-to-use multi-thread APIs, helping them improve app performance with ease. Moreover, AR Engine provides developers with basic AR capabilities such as motion tracking, human body and face tracking, and environment tracking, enabling them to merge virtual and real world elements and by doing so build a brand-new interactive visual experience.AI: A World Without BarriersAs AI technologies continue to develop at an unprecedented pace, smart capabilities are becoming a must-have element in a developer's arsenal. Keeping abreast of the technology trend, ML Kit helps developers build AI-powered apps to help deliver an optimal user experience.According to Mr. Zhang Pingan, Huawei will open up all device-cloud capabilities to developers. This includes ML Kit, which provides services such as translation, text recognition, speech recognition, and face/body detection.ML Kit in HMS Core 5.0 helps developers easily build AI-powered apps. For apps integrated with ML Kit, the speed of face/person detection increases by 70% and the accuracy of text recognition reaches 99%, delivering a smarter and more convenient experience for the user.App Services: Allowing Developers to Focus on InnovationIn HMS Core 5.0, multiple app services have been enhanced. For example, Scan Kit improves the accuracy of barcode scanning and response speed in complex scenarios, thanks to the deep-learning barcode scanning engine. Map Kit provides new capabilities to plan routes for taking public transportation, helping developers enrich the practical functions of their apps.In his speech, Mr. Zhang Ping'an said that multiple top video apps in the Chinese mainland, such as Mango TV, Youku, and Tencent Video, had integrated WisePlay DRM, and that Huawei has been negotiating with multiple content producers to seek cooperation.WisePlay DRM not only enhances DRM protection capabilities from the software, hardware, to enhanced hardware levels, but also builds a complete ChinaDRM ecosystem under cooperation with ChinaDRM and operations organizations. Currently, multiple top video apps in the Chinese mainland have joined the ChinaDRM ecosystem, where WisePlay DRM plays an important role in offering free copyright protection services for audio and video apps.HMS: The Spark of Inspiration to Light the Way ForwardFinally, Mr. Zhang Ping'an said, ""We are constantly facing challenges. The greater the challenge, the more determined we are to build the HMS ecosystem. The huge challenges we faced have inspired us. With support from more and more excellent partners, we join hands with 700 million users around the world to open up HMS and look forward to achieving great things in the future.""HMS Core will be continuously optimized and enhanced in the future to provide richer and better app services, and Huawei looks forward to working together with global developers and partners to bring users a smart life experience in all scenarios.Tell me what you think of the Huawei Developer Conference 2020",351 followers,HMS Core,507,56,62.7M,https://www.quora.com/Are-satellite-CPUs-extremely-fast-in-part-because-of-the-extremely-low-Kelvin-measure
