In Hindu Rashtra, Hindu/Indian culture will be promoted. Great philosophies of Hinduism/Ancient India will be followed & promoted.As Hinduism is already Liberal & Peaceful religion so most Hindus are Secular since childhood. Hindus do believe in Justice, Tolerance, Peace and in respecting all religions. So in Hindu Rashtra, there will not be any problem for Non-Hindus. They will enjoy all the freedoms which they are enjoying today.Why Hindu Rashtra?Though there is not much difference between Secular country & Hindu Rashtra.But we need Hindu Rashtra because:‚ÄîHindus after Independence got a Secular India where Muslims are getting ‚Äúseparate laws‚Äù and unnecessary subsidies. Is this Secularism?All the Churches & Mosques are free from goverment's control then why Temples are under goverment's control? Is this Secularism? Why discrimination with Hindus?Actually India is a secular country only in Constitution but in reality India is not a secular country but a minority appeasing country.That's why I consider Hindu Rashtra better than a pseudo-secular & minority appeasing country.Disclaimer:-Peace!Thanks.",26 followers,Balaji Viswanathan,31K,5.6K,426.5M,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-India-is-the-only-country-facts

The boys never had any sort of structure.The worst part: no repercussions for bad grades or misbehavior.It‚Äôs baffling because what parent doesn‚Äôt understand the importance of consequences? And these parents weren‚Äôt an anomaly. There are so many like this in the world.Both of those boys are now grown.They both are high school dropouts.They both work dismal, menial, low wage jobs on the path to nowhere.It is quite unfortunate - because they, like many kids, were capable of so much more.I‚Äôd wager, one of the great predictors of success is having strong parents, who hold their kids to a standard, with a system of rules, rewards, punishments, encouragement, all with an undercurrent of love, to help that child be the best he or she can be.One of the greatest tragedies in life is that of wasted potential.","358,177 followers",Sean Kernan,16.3K,5.6K,723.5M,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-India-is-the-only-country-facts
26,"Very much so.99 years ago,As democracy is perfected, the office represents, more and more closely, the inner soul of the people. We move toward a lofty ideal. On some great and glorious day the plain folks of the land will reach their heart‚Äôs desire at last, and the White House will be adorned by a downright moron.As far as I‚Äôm concerned, this is one of the most accurate predictions I‚Äôve ever seen.","114,997 followers",Daveed Phoenix,3.1K,9.9K,159.9M,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-India-is-the-only-country-facts

So I wanted a divorce. We were in TX when this happened; I told my mother I was seeking a divorce soon and she told the church. Being as we were still members, they took action against me and me only. It takes TWO to cause marital problems, but being patriarchal, they didn‚Äôt see it that way and blamed only me, cutting me out of the church and not the husband too. So I was ostracized, and forever. Needless to say I wrote a letter back to the church saying he should be too, since he was the one causing the problems, but I never received an answer. As far as I know, they probably didn‚Äôt even open it.Bastards. Always blame the woman.
