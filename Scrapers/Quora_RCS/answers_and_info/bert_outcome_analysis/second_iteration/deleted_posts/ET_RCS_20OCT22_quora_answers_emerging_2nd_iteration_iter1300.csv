That’s it- most of your on campus recruiters will be bankers anyways and you’ll have plenty of exposure to the rat race. Here’s why you should reconsider the career choice.Each year at colleges across the country, thousands of ambitious students come to school without a complete sense of what they would like to do with their lives.

That’s it- most of your on campus recruiters will be bankers anyways and you’ll have plenty of exposure to the rat race. Here’s why you should reconsider the career choice.Each year at colleges across the country, thousands of ambitious students come to school without a complete sense of what they would like to do with their lives. We are told by our parents and teachers that college is a time to truly conceptualize our life interests and discover our passions. What I’ve noticed, however, is that there seems to be a “tracked” path at elite universities. We enter wide-eyed with many interests and, statistically, most of us end up working in conventional careers like investment banking, management consulting, law, and medicine. Out of these paths, the most “prestigious” and sought after one is investment banking/high finance. No high school senior gets an acceptance letter from an elite college and begins thinking about the exciting life he or she will live constructing credit derivatives. Yet that’s where many students end up.There is, without a doubt, a very pervasive I-Banking culture at elite colleges. Roughly half (44%) of business school students at my school, Michigan, will enter financial services once they graduate, with another 30% entering consulting. In 2007, just before the global financial meltdown, almost 50 percent of Harvard seniors took jobs on Wall Street. According to the New York Times, in 2010 close to 36 percent of Princeton graduates with full-time jobs went into finance, down from a pre-crisis high of 46 percent in 2006. This pattern appears over and over again in America’s elite colleges; generally, aroundFor any given student, getting a job in these industries seems to make good practical sense. The money is good, the action non-stop, and the high status intoxicating. It’s the next “step” for a high achieving student from a top tier school. Why waste your [Elite Name] degree on something else? After all, banks hire almost exclusively from campuses like ours. If you have a genuine interest for finance, an understanding of the 100+ hour work weeks, willingness to replace your social and physical needs to advance a career, and a talent in financial analysis, you certainly should try your hand in banking. The problem however, is not with these students, it is with the substantial amount who enter the industry without a complete picture of what they are getting into, coupled with the flawed reasoning that i-banking is a quick path to riches and prestige, or that is the only practical way to have great ‘exit ops’ into high paying jobs in other industries. So, if you are considering banking for these supposed benefits instead of being genuinely attracted to the nature of the job, I ask you to take this in earnest.I’ve had a number of conversations with my finance-orientated friends who admit to me that their goal is to start a business, be their own boss, or create lasting value. They tend to view banking as a means to achieve this goal, and tell themselves that the money they make in banking will give them sufficient operating capital to create a business. What this argument fails to realize is that access to capital in the 21st century is orders of magnitude easier than it was for our parents. Instead of relying on a wealthy family or a loan from a bank, our generation has instant access to crowd funding, websites that link us up with seed investors, and a plethora of free online courses that teach the ins and outs of venture capital. If you have an idea- act now. You don’t need to work for a bank for a few years to fund the project that interests you — whether that be a business, service, blog, or whatever gets your heart racing. Build something you want, and the days and nights you spend perfecting it will be vastly more fulfilling than building excel spreadsheets for your supervisors.The unfortunate reality is that the many young bankers stick inside the industry, even if they despise it. This is best explained through the theory of “golden handcuffs”. By living in the world of high finance, you can become stuck in an endless cycle of ambition to move on to bigger deals, outrank your peers, and spend more money. In this world, prestige is intoxicating, and the worry of being seen as weak for quitting stops many status-conscious bankers.In her book “Suits: A Woman on Wall Street”, Nina Godiwalla recounts her time as an analyst for Morgan Stanley. She describes being ecstatic the first few weeks, basking in her prestige and feeling powerful when telling friends and family where she worked. Over the next two years, she descended into severe depression because of the monotonous work, inhuman hours, and cold culture of the bank. Did she quit? No. Nina completed the two years out of fear that her co-workers and college friends would think of her as a failure. Her supervisors told her that thousands of students would kill to be in her position. Her parents told her that she would be turning down too big of a paycheck for the daughter of Persian immigrants. It wasn’t until multiple years later did Nina have the courage to quit and pursue what interested her.In many respects, this phenomenon is closely related to the admissions process of colleges. If you aren’t currently searching for banking internships, perhaps you can relate to the college admissions process. Can you recall being admitted to top-tier schools, but having a fleeting thought of attending a lesser-know school that is more aligned to your personal interests? I certainty did, but I was too worried that my friends and family would see me as not living up to my potential. In a sense, we all want to pass the “cocktail party” test. Meaning, we want strangers to light up when we announce we’re attending [Elite School], since many people associate getting into a good school with being a “success”.The same is true with the banking/consulting rat race within these schools, where some students (and maybe their parents) think of success in terms of what would impress the most in the cocktail party. While many aren’t doing this consciously, there is comfort in impressing others through associating with a big name rather than our specific experiences and goals. The name is instant credentialing, it allows for mental shortcuts to judge others. I believe a key aspect of mental health is separating oneself from this thought process. Since each and every one of us is unique, we should avoid the crowd mentality of what defines success for a student graduating from a high-caliber university. If you genuinely are attracted to banking, all the power to you. If, however, you are skeptical about the “tracked” career paths, listen to your gut and shrug off any judgment that might be bestowed upon you.",11 followers,Pedro Miranda,5.9K,354,15M,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-skills-required-in-a-person-to-become-an-investment-banker

So they added water to the mechanism to make the can approximately the same weight as a normal one.But the water presented another problem: it greatly increased the likelihood of bacteria invading the drink. So they chlorinated it.But of course, if there’s some kind of failure, you don’t want to be drinking chlorinated cola, and Coke didn’t want people to think there was something wrong with the cola itself.So they added ammonium sulfate to the water, which is the chemical responsible for the rotten-egg stink. That way, if there was a failure, you’d know immediately and not drink from that can. (That was the theory, anyway; most of the customers didn’t get the memo.)Failures, unfortunately, happened quite often. Many people complained that their prize was soaked and stinking. Other people reported that their Coke smelled awful and tasted worse, unaware that there was supposed to have been a prize inside, because the mechanism failed to activate altogether.Worse, people who got the defective cans became terrified at the strange odor and foreign object floating in their drink, thinking it had been tampered with and poisoned by some nefarious criminal. People checked themselves into the hospital, and rumors grew the Coke wasn’t safe to drink. This, of course, got blown way out of proportion very, very quickly.Somehow Coca-Cola had decided not to mark the MagiCans in any way whatsoever. They just looked like normal cans.

After hopping on from using one pen to another for so long, I had finally found the 'Perfect Pen' for me and it was CelloAround 2015 I guess, I don't know what got into minds of Cello, and all of a sudden my favorite pen wasn't ₹10 anymore. It's price was increased to ₹15.It felt like a betrayal. Even though it was ₹5 only, but I could get a pack of Green Lays for same amount. I started using some other pen and this time too I wasn't alone as most of other students too moved to some other pen. There were still some students (Ambani's children) who kept using this pen but most moved on.Now I don't have any numbers to prove, but this decision turned out to be a disaster as Company's bestseller wasn't the student favorite anymore. Other brands were quick to fill the void left by Butterflow.Company tried to mend damages by offering a refill (MRP 5) along with pen which means price of pen was effectively reduced to ₹10 only but it still wasn't enough. Eventually company reduced the price to ₹10 only but it takes no time to lose market share, but it's really hard to gain it again.In a final attempt to revive their best seller, company decided to offer refill along with pen at ₹10 only. I'm not sure if the decision worked but even if it did, company had to offer an additional refill at same price thus reducing the profit margin.Hence, a small decision (actually not that small as it was a 50% hike in price) would turn out to be so costly. Company lost their market share and also ended up with reduced profit margins.Moral of the story:- If you show too much greed, you might end up killing the Golden Goose.(Credits:-Edit:- Thank you all for 1k upvotes ^_^Edit 2:- Thanks a lot guys for 2k upvotes (My first answer).

Gucci intentionally chose her based on the fact that she does not fit the “normal” canon of model beauty. To a certain extent, I do get the whole idea.Today's fashion world is not the same as it was 20 or 30 years ago. Fashion industry now gives more space to what might be seen as “unconventional” such as plus size models or something “unique” in characteristic or trait.Let us not forget that one of the most famous models with the highest pay in the world is Winnie Harlow, a 26 year old woman affected by vitiligo. It is a condition where pale white patches develop on the skin.It just shows that nowadays characters and faces are chosen on the basis of their meaning and the atmosphere desired by the creative director and are no longer the embodiment of the audience’s erotic fantasies.However, what might have been an opportunity for reflection, for redrawing the beauty standards by the industry to show that our society is not necessarily so shallow has turned into a complete disaster.The tenor of the jokes, insults, and hate spewed on social media aimed at Harutyunyan makes it clear the comments did not exclusively derive from a misunderstanding of the fashion industry’s changing beauty tastes.Harutyunyan became a victim of body shaming because her features are not those which social media has forced society to place above all others. Social networks like Instagram have cultivated a particularly narrow remit of beauty standards that leave little room for diversity. This is why a 23 year-old woman is now forced to read thousands of comments under her pictures that compare her to a “shit-hole”.In response to the storm of negativity, Harutyunyan remarked that this is not the first time she has received negative comments about her appearance and her numerous collaborations with Gucci. In an interview, she said that while it hurts, she is determined to ignore them.That's the message we really need to spread and accept as the new common standard. I suggest for each to concentrate on yourself on who you are and what you really love.However, it seems our society is still not ready for it.","38,616 followers",Kiara Bay,6K,526,55.4M,https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-skills-required-in-a-person-to-become-an-investment-banker

Just to woo the female population with their new carIt was through personalized addressed “love letter” written on pink paper, only to send it to random 50,000 Spanish women across the country.Some of the samples read like this:“Yesterday we saw each other again. We met on the street and I noticed how you glanced interestedly in my direction,” it said in the letter.It even went further to say, “I only need to be with you for a couple of minutes, and even if it doesn’t work out, I promise you won’t forget our little experience together.”Unfortunately, this backfired.Spain is a country which has got a very diversified culture, just like what India has got, with a wide range of ethnicities. Hence it backfired.What happened next?Spain’s national newspaper El Pais reported a survey from several women, who actually were frightened and reluctant to go out. No woman got a clue that these love letters were sent by Fiat company, and not by any random boyfriend!Fiat was sued by general public when it came to light about this campaign which became a disastrous one. Fiat’s PR manager tried to explain the motivation of love, romance and intrigue, but instead it fuelled anger, hatred and fear amongst women as if random guys started stalking women.Before releasing this campaign, Fiat made sure to run a pilot test, which was successful with a sample of random women. Still it backfired.Reason:With the lawsuits filed, Fiat had to pay fines for advertising campaign and personal damages to several women, particularly influencers. Although it didn’t affected their sales much, but perception of women towards Fiat changed and was negative.No automobile company dared to do this type of bullshit thereafter, in Spain as well as in any other country.Thanks for reading",0 followers,Vonn Russell,1.8K,157,6.7M,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-of-the-greatest-marketing-disasters-in-history

Although it wasn't so much portable, as ""luggable.""But it was a fully functioning, transportable computer, it was relatively easy to use, and it gave you everything you needed for a then low price of $1,795.The first units shipped in June of '81, and by August the company had sold $10 million dollars worth of computers. By February, revenues had reached $100 million.But soon, Apple and Compaq introduced more sophisticated versions of portable computers into the market.][That prompted the Osborne Computer Company to acknowledge their computer had certain ""shortcomings,"" and announced they were going to launch an updated and improved model a few months down the road.Then a funny thing happened.Everyone stopped buying the Osborne 1 - in anticipation of the better model coming out later in the year.The company became instantly cash-starved. As a matter of fact, they had absolutely no income for the next month. As that trend continued, other things went wrong, and soon, massive layoffs began.The incident became known as the ""Osborne Effect.""Defined, the ""Osborne Effect"" is when a company pre-announces a future product, and that announcement has a devastating effect on their existing product. In other words, the company commits unwitting suicide as the public stops buying their current product and waits for the new one. You might notice which company took the Osborne Effect lesson to heart:Apple.It is FAMOUSLY silent on its new products. As we've mentioned before, Steve Jobs once viciously sued a magazine for leaking details about an upcoming new product. He didn't do it to punish the magazine, he did it as a warning to his employees. He wanted to send a signal about how seriously he took secrecy.The Osborne Computer company shut its doors not long after. A company killed by the promise of a new product.But the ""Osborne Effect"" remains as a harsh lesson.”]",0 followers,Mohammed Ziyan,788,430,4M,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-of-the-greatest-marketing-disasters-in-history

It was established in the year 1941 with its headquarters back then set in Bombay.ItsHe thought of establishing his own company and negotiated with Chrysler Motor Corporation of USA. Thus, the company Premier was born.Initially, Premier sold licensed trucks sourced from Chrysler’s stables, which include Dodge and Fargo.Premier Automobiles Limited (PAL) can very much be credited as the first ever automobile manufacturer from India. It was established in the year 1941 with its headquarters back then set in Bombay.ItsHe thought of establishing his own company and negotiated with Chrysler Motor Corporation of USA. Thus, the company Premier was born.Initially, Premier sold licensed trucks sourced from Chrysler’s stables, which include Dodge and Fargo.The icing on the cake was the iconic Premier Padmini, which was introduced in the 1964 model year. The earlier iterations of the Padmini were heavily based on the Fiat 1100, which was sold in Europe.Till today, the Padmini retains its charm and is now considered a modern classic.Those days, the Indian customer had to choose between either the Padmini or the Hindustan Ambassador, since the economy was closed for overseas automakers in India.Premier cashed in on the Padmini and their next major product was the 118NE launched in 1988. The 118NE was based on the Lada Riva from Russia and was marketed as a modern version or the spiritual heir to the Padmini.Interestingly, Premier collected as much as a whopping 118 crore as booking money for the 118NE.It managed to hold its own in the Indian market despite the presence of homegrown brands like Maruti and Tata.So, one will expect premier to go from strength to strength in the next couple of decades or so?Wrong.It was in the 1990′s that Premier had completely lost the plot. As the economic liberalisation took place in 1993, many automotive giants were readying to start their operations in India one after the other.One such brand was Peugeot, who were one of the first brands to have set foot here after the economy had finally opened here. Peugeot had initially struck a deal with Premier in order to manufacture the 309 sedan in India.This deal had ensured that both Premier and Peugeot had to have a stake of 32 percent each in the joint venture.Thus, the rest of the 36 percent remaining will be distributed between various public sector companies across the country.This deal being a joint venture, was eventually pinned in the year 1993. The 309 came to the Indian market in the 1994 model year as the first product. It had rolled out from Peugeot’s newly constructed Kalyan facility in Maharashtra.Despite being advanced than majority of the cars sold here back in the day, the 309 could not set sales charts running here for Peugeot.The year 1995 saw another entrant coming here in Fiat. It seemed that the Italian firm had really studied the Indian market and brought its once European hosteller, the Uno.In response, the Uno had generated massive demands and as per reports, about 2,94,000 bookings were placed just one month after its launch in 1996.Sadly, Fiat fell prey to its own success and in response, did not decide to ramp up production for the Uno to meet demand.This led to waiting periods leading to more than a year for customers who had booked the Uno. Thus as a result, many of them decided to cancel the bookings for the Uno and this impacted Fiat severely in India.Well, you've heard about Peugeot and Fiat and their initial presence in India. Now let’s come to what can pretty much be called an anti-climatic turn of events.Fiat felt that they need to be more customer oriented in order to make a mark in the market. So they decided on bringing its ‘World Car’, the Palio for 1998.Fiat wanted a partner in making the Palio and for that, approached Premier. This was because Fiat had good relations with Premier over the years and wanted to extend it further by asking some amount of help from them.At first, Premier declined but then decided to help Fiat, without knowing the consequences it would be facing for the same. While this could be touted as a shrewd business move, it was also an unethical one when viewed from another angle.On the other hand, PAL’s earlier partner Peugeot felt cheated and in turn questioned the integrity of Premier coming to the joint venture, for which they had all the right in the world to. This also led to Peugeot dragging Fiat to court in a case which it won.But the one who had suffered the most from the above dispute amidst serious uncertainty was none other than Premier.Peugeot decided to exit the Indian market almost immediately on a very sour note, after launching just a single product in the market in the 309. On the other hand, Fiat continued on till it made the decision to exit the Indian market recently.InFiat in turn had also bought PAL’s Kurla facility before selling it later to relocate to its then newly developmed Ranjangaon plant in Maharashtra. Talking about Premier, they were of course not helped by the fact that the brand now could not even hold a candle to many major automakers with its outdated product line-up.As of now, brand Premier is nowhere to be seen when it comes to the Indian market. It’s a sad ending to a brand which had huge early potential and most importantly put India on the map as a country having its own automaker.It is very much safe to say that Premier were the victims of their own success. Thus, the legacy of Premier remains today, albeit only hanging by a thread now.Picture Credits: Google.Thank you.",3 followers,Peter Koch,1.4K,0,0,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-of-the-greatest-marketing-disasters-in-history

The BritiHere’s a pretty interesting one:Coca-Cola is one of the most well-known companies in the world with its own fair share of marketing blunders. It also owns several well-known brands in the USA such as Minuet Maid, Powerade, and Dasani.Way back in 2003, Dasani was a huge hit with the Americans (even though it’s just tap water). Everything seemed great. To make it better, there was a rising demand of bottled water in the UK, and so Coca-Cola decided to expand Dasani overseas. Yay! More money!When Dasani was launched in the UK, the first thing that went wrong was the source of the water. The British preferred naturally sourced water over tap water as 91% of bottled water in the UK was naturally sourced. Dasani was simply filtered tap water with a few things added to it, which wasn’t a strong marketing point. It was expensive, too. To produce the water, it only cost 0.03p per half liter, but for some reason when it reached the shelves, it got marked up to the exorbitant price of 95p per half liter. Needless to say, once the media found out that Coca-Cola was charging so much for tap water, they didn’t take it so well.It got worse when Coca-Cola launched their online marketing campaign and advertising their water as being “full of spunk.” For context, spunk is slang for semen in the UK, so Coca-Cola basically ended up claiming that their bottles were full of semen— not to mention the fact that the models in the ads seemed to have a preference of dumping water on their faces rather than drinking it from the bottle normally. That went over reeeaaal well with the British ;)Me either ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)JkjkAw yeah baby I love the feeling of semen on my face!#relationshipgoalsIn response, they cleaned up their ads and attempted to justify the fact that their water was so expensive because of their super advanced water purifying techniques: “multi-barrier filtration,” “reverse osmosis,” and that Dasani’s water went through “a technique perfected by NASA to purify fluids on spacecraft.”Sooooo they were basically saying that their water was purified from fluids likeThe real problem was that by using those buzzwords, Coca-Cola accidentally ended up insulting its water supplier: Thames Water. The water company felt like Coca-Cola was insulting their water; as if it wasn’t already pure enough since they subjected their water to a nine-stage filtration process. A representative from Coca-Cola shot back at the media and Thames Water, saying that the source of the water was irrelevant and that the purification was to make the water taste better. The media pounced on that claim too, and participants of a blind taste test found that they couldn’t tell the difference between Dasani’s water and Thames Water’s tap water.Great, now you’ve offended your water supplier.On top of that, it was soon discovered that Dasani was filled with twice legal amount of a substance that can cause cancer— bromate. Thames Water didn’t have any bromate in it, so where did it come from?It turned out that the final stages of the purification process for Dasani was responsible for it (surprise surprise). The ozone used to sterilize the water had reacted with bromide, which naturally occurs in tap water. This resulted in a recall of over half a million bottles of Dasani.Needless to say, the combined news of Dasani being tap water, filled with a potential cancer causing substance, and trying to sell it with about a 316,600% markup ended up terribly for Coca-Cola. It was a complete disaster and resulted in Dasani being withdrawn from the UK and cancelled planned launches for other places in Europe.Feeling bad for Coca-Cola? Don’t be. As they say, there’s a silver lining to every cloud. About a decade later, Coca-Cola learned from its mistakes and launched another water brand in the UK region called Glaceau Smartwater. Glaceau Smartwater was sourced from spring water instead of public water supplies. Better marketing tactics were used (without semen *wink wink*) and it became an instant success with the British.Phew! This answer took such a long time to write.

Dave was destined by fate to become a highly regarded marketing professor. This is because his family owned a business, a canning plant in Wisconsin, that somehow continued to be successful while simultaneously and repeatedly coming up with products that became legendary disasters.This was not all bad. You see as a university professor Dave could teach an entire course on marketing based almost entirely upon the one principle:I think it was the sincerity and intensity with which Dave told these stories that filled his classes and secured the undivided attention of his students, for when remembering these disasters Dave, mentally traumatized by past events, seemed to channel Samuel Taylor Coleridge’s Ancient Mariner when warning of horrors that await the unwary.One of the worst of these disasters combined two Wisconsin products, cranberries and apples. Combined these two things taste really good. The tartness of the cranberries complements the sweetness of the apples. And, indeed, decades later the well known company Ocean Spray combined cranberries and apples successfully to make Cran-apple Juice.Dave’s family company was somewhat less successful. (Note that I use the word “somewhat” in the sense of “Oh my God!”) That may have been because of theIt did not help matters that when mixed together cranberries and apples produce a lovely light brown color.",7 followers,Craig Anderson,731,150,3M,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-of-the-greatest-marketing-disasters-in-history

This sensitivity would entail taking into account the language or culture of your new market when expanding your markets.2. The Boring Ford EDSELFor its brand-new mystery automobile, the EDSEL, Ford Motor Company produced an unduly dramatic marketing hype in 1957. To create excitement, dealers had to hide the model from view.However, because it did not improve upon previous Ford products, car customers were unimpressed when it was released.The primary issue was that the Edsel was in direct competition with other Ford automobiles, matching the sticker price of numerous other cars in Ford's Mercury line while providing consumers with nothing novel or distinctive.The LearningOffer customers brand-new, intriguing products at all times. A sloppy strategy that is unlikely to keep your clients satisfied is launching a product with few differences.3. McDonald’s: Gold Medal For Lack Of Campaign PreparationBased on an estimation of goals from the previous Olympics, McDonald's introduced a scheme during the 1984 Olympics in an effort to patriotically raise sales whereby every U.S. medal achieved equaled a free meal for U.S. citizens. The McDonald's marketing team had no idea that the United States would win many medals, which would have cost them a lot of money.The consumer would receive a complimentary Big Mac, fries, or Coke, depending on whether the Americans took home a gold, silver, or bronze medal in that competition. The marketing department at McDonald's most likely looked at the number of medals the US team had won at the 1976 Olympics.Instead of the 34 golds, the U.S. succeeded in 1976; the 1984 games saw the Americans bring home 83. With the Eastern Bloc competition out of the way, the U.S. wound up winning significantly more medals as the last time around — a mind-bogglingWhich meant McDonald’s had to give away much more food than they expected, including more than twice as many valuable Big Macs.The LearningGiving back to your customers is a terrific idea, but make sure you can fulfil all of your commitments. Don't give out free goods to clients without first taking into account the chance that your investment can balloon into a cost.4. Coca Cola: The New Coke That People HatedIn 1975, Pepsi launched its “Pepsi Challenge” contest, wherein volunteers would take a blind taste test of two different sodas and say which one they preferred. The results of the tests tended to show that most people in the United States chose the taste of Pepsi over rival Coca-Cola. The campaign resulted in higher sales for Pepsi.In 1985, the company threw out its classic formula, introduced a new product named New Coke, and halted production of the original recipe the same week.Coke's sales drastically decreased as a result of the response, which happened almost immediately. This resulted in corporate management saying shortly after at a news conference on July 11 of the same year that they would stick to the tried-and-true recipe.The study and development of flavour, as well as marketing research, analysis, and advertising, cost millions of dollars. But that didn't persuade folks that something new had to be superior.The LearningCoca-Cola underestimated the emotional bond people had with their product. The old Coke was with them for almost 100 years at that point, it created a lot of memories, and when the company was trying to take away, the customers felt like a part of their memories was being taken away.5. Electrolux: Nothing Sucks Like An ElectroluxElectrolux, a Swedish manufacturer of electric appliances, was keen to introduce their vacuum cleaners to the western market in 1960.They hired ""Cogent Elliot,"" an advertising firm with ""Mike Fox"" as creative director because he believed it was a good idea to employ a pun in the advertisement.So they adopted it.The problem was that the pun didn't work as well back then, and the advertisement became the punchline of many jokes for a very long time.Now that I think about it, the advertisement might have been successful if it had been released in 2019.The Learning:These brands are succeeding despite these largest catastrophes because they have improved as a result of their missteps. Every person and every company should act in such way.Don't make the same error again. Keep developing by taking lessons from them. And never forget that every setback opens the door to a fresh chance or concept.",48 followers,Sanjay Shetty,600,0,0,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-of-the-greatest-marketing-disasters-in-history

Probably the worst marketing disaster for a private company in the country’s history and probably the world, happened 30 yearsProbably the “Mention the numbers 349 to anyone who was alive or came of age in the early 1990s in the Philippines and, chances are, they instantly know what you’re talking about. Probably the worst marketing disaster for a private company in the country’s history and probably the world, happened 30 years ago this year, and all because of those three numbers. The Pepsi 349 incident of 1992 is still talked about to this day, especially by those who had the misfortune of owning the bottlecaps with those numbers emblazoned underneath.Pepsi 349The Pepsi 349 saga begins in 1984, when beverage behemoth PepsiCo Inc. introduced a promotional campaign in order to increase market share against its bitter rival, Coca-Cola. At the time, Coke was miles ahead of Pepsi in the so-called softdrink wars, after the latter dominated the local market in the late 1970s. Pepsi needed to push back and gain some ground. Christopher Sinclair, who was then PepsiCo’s CEO at only 38 years old, decided on an exciting new marketing campaign to get more people excited about buying Pepsi: Number Fever, which was developed by a New York-based promotions executive named Pedro Vergara.After a generally successful rollout in the U.S., Number Fever was expanded to a few Latin American countries, which was home to some of the world’s largest softdrink consumers—Argentina, Chile, Guatemala, and Mexico.Years later, on January 15, 1992, Pepsi Cola Products (Philippines), Inc., or PCPPI, the local franchise holder of PepsiCo Inc., formally applied for a permit with the Department of Trade and Industry to conduct the nationwide Number Fever campaign in the Philippines. The promo was simple: buyers of Pepsi Cola products—Pepsi, 7-Up, Mirinda, and Mountain Dew—could take home the amount printed underneath the bottle caps or crowns if the corresponding three-digit number matches the one Pepsi announces as the winner for that day. Amounts ranged from as little as P100 to as much as P1 million.It was like the mini version of the lottery, but with slightly better odds of winning: 28.8 million to one, according to published ads during that time.The DTI approved PCPPI’s application on January 23, and Number Fever commenced soon after. A Mexican consultancy firm called DG Consultores randomly preselected the winning numbers along with their corresponding security codes, which was then sent to PCPPI.To ensure that the list of winning numbers would not be tampered with, it was kept inside a safety deposit box inside the UCPB branch in Legaspi Village, Makati. The security box could only be opened using two keys, each held by a representative of the DTI and PCPPI.The DTI then supervised the production of the winning crowns and their subsequent release into the market.An instant successAlmost immediately after the campaign started in February 1992, it proved to be an instant hit. People began buying Pepsi products, keeping the caps and crowns, and then waiting for the nightly announcement of winners on ABS-CBN’sWinners were able to claim their cash prizes at designated Pepsi redeeming stations after the company verified that the caps or crowns were legitimate and had not been tampered with.Because of the success of Number Fever, PCPPI applied for an extension of the promo for five more weeks. A second list of randomly preselected winning numbers was kept in a safety deposit box of UCPB Aguirre branch, and just like before, two keys held by different people from PCPPI and DTI were needed to open it.The nightmare beginsOn the evening of May 25, 1992, it was announced that 349 was the winning number. Ordinarily, only a few buyers would turn up to collect their prize. But this time, tens of thousands of people came forward holding in their hands a cap or crown with the number 349. In all, Pepsi had reportedly manufactured from 600,000 to as many as 800,000 caps and crowns bearing the winning number.For the company, clearly there had been a mistake. If it went ahead and paid all of the people who had the winning number, Pepsi reportedly would have had to shell out as much as $32 billion, which was simply unjustifiable. And so, after an emergency meeting at 3 a.m., PCPPI executives said there had been a computer error concerning the printing of the winning numbers. AHowever, on May 28, after a careful review of the process, PCPPI announced that 349 was the winning number, but only those crowns with the matching security codes would be honored. The company published a list of the cash prizes worth P100 to P50,000 with the specific security codes and said that it would not be disbursing the cash prizes to the 349 claimants whose codes did not match those in the official list. Instead, Pepsi said it would offer them P500 as a gesture of goodwill. Based on its calculations, Pepsi would limit costs to around $6 million if about half of the claimants accepted the P500 offer, which was at least manageable compared to the billions it would have otherwise had to shell out.Many of the claimants did say yes to the goodwill offer—a total of 486,170 in fact—and according to records, Pepsi coughed up over P240 million to all of them.However, there were still a whole lot of people demanding to get the full amount in their crowns. Riots erupted outside the Pepsi factory gates in Quezon City; angry claimants threw rocks and homemade explosives at corporate headquarters; and delivery trucks were vandalized, overturned, and even burned. In a tragic incident, a homemade grenade bounced off a truck and exploded near a schoolteacher named Aniceta Rosario and a five-year-old girl. The blast killed them both and injured several others. The violence lasted for months.Taking it to the courtsIt didn’t take long before the Pepsi 349 claimants started to organize themselves into groups that had names like United 349 and Solid 349. One of the most prominent, however, was called Coalition 349 and was led by a man named Vicente Del Fierro Jr., who had initially scoffed at the promotional campaign and called it a “a social disease that nurtures the gambling instinct in our children.” But after his daughter said she held one of the 349 crowns, he became an advocate for the movement to make Pepsi pay.As many as 22,000 people filed around 687 civil suits and over 5,200 criminal complaints against Pepsi to do just that. Del Fierro even hired an American lawyer and filed a case against the company in New York. However, the court dismissed the suit and said it should be heard in the Philippines.In one of those suits, a group called Ugnayan 349 filed a demand letter to Pepsi with the Quezon City RTC in November 1992. Four years later, in 1996, the RTC rendered a judgment that said the plaintiffs “were not entitled to their crowns” but ordered PCPPI to pay each of them P10,000 as moral damages. Both Pepsi and the plaintiffs filed appeals and took it all the way to the Supreme Court, which, in 2007, rendered a verdict that referenced similar other cases filed across the country, all of which, by then, had already been settled.“In the instant case, not only are the legal rights and relations of the parties substantially the same as those passed upon in the other Pepsi 349 cases, but the facts, the applicable laws, the causes of action and the issues are identical such that a ruling in one case is a bar to any attempt to re-litigate the same issue,” the SC decision read. “Final and executory rulings have settled that 349 crowns bearing the wrong security code areThere are many other aspects to the story of the Pepsi 349 incident: how the Pepsi CEO flew to Manila to personally meet with then-Philippines President Fidel V. Ramos, how protesters stormed Malacañang during a visit of then-U.S. President Bill Clinton, and how the DTI has since tightened rules on companies’ marketing and promotional campaigns. The actual cases involving the Pepsi 349 incident may have since been resolved and have slowly dissipated into the mists of history, but for those who lived through it, especially the thousands who fought for the right to be heard and acknowledged, the story lives on.Resource Articles:",214 followers,Aishwarya Nair,40.9K,53,1.2M,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-of-the-greatest-marketing-disasters-in-history

In fact, it was so effective that it is still remembered today. Still, I can’t read about it without the phrase “total disaster” coming to mind.A little background for non-USA residents reading this: We have this game we play called “baseball”. You might have heard of it. Anyway, most baseball teams try to draw fans with various promotions. They might give away free baseball caps or free bobblehead dolls or other souvenirs, or offer hot dogs or other food items inexpensively or freely, or put on fireworks displays or celebrity appearances or other interesting events.So it was July 12, 1979, and the Chicago White Sox were playing a doubleheader (two games, one after the other) against the Detroit Tigers, at Comiskey Park in Chicago. Mike Veeck, the promotions director for the White Sox (and son of team owner Bill Veeck—and by the way, the last name is pronounced to rhyme with “wreck”, not “reek”), had the idea to tap into the hatred of rock music fans for disco music. He designated July 12 as “Disco Demolition Night”, and got Steve Dahl—a locally famous rock DJ at radio station WLUP—to lead the event. Dahl was already an avowed hater of disco who used to destroy disco records on the air. Fans who brought disco records to the game would get in for 98 cents. They would deposit the records in crates—and between the two games of the doubleheader, Dahl would bring the records out onto the field and blow them up.Veeck badly underestimated how popular the event would be. The game sold out. Almost 50,000 people packed the stadium, and an estimated 20,000 more were left outside. Many of them climbed walls or jumped turnstiles and got in anyway. Most of the attendees weren’t especially fond of baseball, but they were there to make their musical tastes known:While fans were supposed to put their disco records in boxes, many of them kept them at their seats—and started throwing them onto the field as the first game progressed, like sharp Frisbees. Others threw bottles, golf balls, fireworks, and other objects. Newscasters noted a distinct smell of marijuana in the air, and the mood got increasingly restless. . .Somehow, the teams managed to finish the first game. Detroit won it 4–1.And then Steve Dahl, dressed in military regalia as the leader of the Anti-Disco Army, came out with a huge crate of records. . .. . . and he blew them up, leaving a smoking crater in the middle of the field. . .. . . and as many as 7000 drunk and/or stoned fans poured onto the field, as both teams barricaded themselves in their clubhouses. Some of the fans ran the bases, or danced around the burning shards of records. Others stole whatever they could get their hands on, including the bases and bats. Some set fires. Some destroyed the batting cage. At least one couple allegedly had sex on third base. Veeck begged everyone to clear the field; no one listened. It took the arrival of the Chicago PD in riot gear to restore order: 39 people were arrested. Even after the groundskeepers spent another hour trying to clean up the field, the umpires ruled that the second game could not be played; it was eventually forfeited.A contemporary news report on Disco Demolition Night:A documentary from ESPN about Disco Demolition Night:More than one commentator has noted that there are some ugly racial undertones to the event. Disco was made by, listened to, and associated with black, Latinx, and gay musicians and audiences; rock fans were overwhelmingly white, and 70s rock music is very heteronormative. Nile Rodgers has compared Disco Demolition Night to the Nazi book burnings, and he’s got a point—even if you hate a certain type of art and think it’s “degenerate”, there’s something very wrong about making a public spectacle out of destroying it.The promotion did do what it set out to do—draw fans to the park. But it didn’t do the game of baseball any favors; it cost the White Sox money to repair the field; it badly damaged Mike Veeck’s career; and it may have contributed somewhat to the national decline of disco music’s popularity.For more, see",18 followers,Asim Qureshi,5.6K,996,155.4M,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-of-the-greatest-marketing-disasters-in-history

The story comes from a friend who worked at a particular company at the time, around the year 2000 or so.The marketing department of a subsidiary of a large financial institution had a brilliant idea for a promotion. Hockey is big in this city, so they decided to print their company name and logo on hockey pucks, good quality, solid, real hockey pucks, and hand them to people outside an NHL game. This was not in conjunction with the team or venue, just something they did on their own outside in the street.For this promotion, they sought volunteers from other departments to help hand out the promotional pucks to fans. The IT guys would not normally get involved in this sort of thing, but they liked where this was going.On the night of this exciting promotion, the employees happily handed out these promotional hockey pucks outside the venue to fans that were happy to get something for free. All was well with the promotion.Then the game started. The exciteable home team fans got a little rowdy and, you guessed it, decided to throw their free, promotional pucks on the ice. Pucks and more pucks rained down on the ice as more fans joined in the fun. The game surface was soon littered with promotional pucks. Real, solid, heavy hockey pucks.When the cleanup began, the arena employees soon realized these were no souvenir pucks the fans bought with good money. The fund company’s logo was right there for them to see. The press picked up the story in this hockey city, and soon plenty of bad press was aimed at the company who had unofficially given out promotional items outside a hockey game, basically giving fans something to throw on the ice. Bad press is still press, but … still. The company was probably happy with all the attention, but plenty of people were shaking their heads at the blunder.There is a lesson here. For every well-meaning marketing department that comes up with a great idea, they need that one person on their team, the one whose brain immediately thinks the worst. “What would I do with a free puck? Probably throw the thing on the ice.” Or, “Hehe, that sounds dirty.” That one oddball character could help prevent marketing disasters.EDIT: Ooh, lookie lookie what just showed up in a recent basement cleaning:",13 followers,Vishal Upadhyay,9.5K,52,715.4K,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-of-the-greatest-marketing-disasters-in-history

The Kardashian Drug - PromotionWe all know the popularity Kim Kardashian brings to the table.With over 100 million followers on Instagram, Kim could promote a single product from one post and reap millions in royalties…...and that’s exactly what she did.During Kim Kardashian’s pregnancy she was suffering from morning sickness and wanted to make some changes in her lifestyle and health.She would use a pharmaceutical drug known as Diclegis which would help treat her morning sickness (typically nausea and vomiting) and thought why not make a buck by promoting it.Here’s a picture of Kim’s post…As you can see in this post Kim Kardashian posted multiple positive statements about how the drug helped treat her morning sickness.And while this post seem harmless, the FDA (Food & Drug Administration) did not think so.The FDA filed a letter to the stating that while Kim promoted the drug she did not disclose the side effects of drug such as drowsiness.These side effects must be stated in all pharmaceutical advertisements.As a result the post had to be taken down with multiple warnings by the FDA.…3. Jägermeister Chaotic Party - PromotionJagermeister is known as a party drink for many teenagers and adults.With a creative campaign to promote themselves through a party commercial, things didn’t turn out example how they wanted it to.This Jagermeister commercial went from being a party drink to a failed human experiment withThe commercial was supposed to show a fog-like effect, and so the marketers decided to use liquid nitrogen.But here’s what they didn’t realize…When you mix liquid nitrogen with anything, it actually pushes oxygen away which as a result caused everyone to suffocate.Sometimes it’s good to hire a chemist when you perform experiments like this!…4. Proof That LifeLock Protects You - PromotionLifeLock is a security company that wanted to prove how powerful its security system was.So the genius CEO Todd Davis decided to place his actual social security number (SIN) on his website, to prove the strength of his companies system.And as predicted you probably knew what happened after…Todd Davis has been a victim of identity theft 13 times where the first known identify theft was Todd being in charge of paying back a $500 loan.And that wasn’t the worst part…Because of Todd’s bold advertisement, the Federal Trade Commission declared it as a deceptive form of advertising, and fined him $12 million.What went from a creative idea at the time actually ruined the company and the CEO’s personal life.I think we all know the lesson here……5. New Coke vs. Old Coke - PromotionCoca Cola vs. Pepsi has been a war for decades, and many Pepsi fans have stated that they choose it over Coca Cola because it was sweeter.This lead Coca Cola to wanting to change their famous Coke drink to creating “New Coke” which is a sweeter version of the old Coke.And guess what happened?A massive backlash from Coca Cola drinkers saying this was the worst decision, and that they preferred the old Coke over the new Coke.Most companies that promote campaigns which leads into a marketing disaster are typically known as “New Coke” because of how big of a failure it was.Although Coca Cola would never admit how much money they actually lost, it was recorded that they had spent $4 million in developing the product launch, and over $30 million of wasted New Coke products.…6. The Energizer Competitor PromotionThis was probably my favorite, because this promotion actually lead to energizer promoting its #1 competitor, Duracell .. almost doubling its sales!Energizer launched an commercial where people correlated the bunny and the battery as Duracell rather than Energizer.As a result Duracell doubled its sales, and although Energizer didn’t lose too much they definitely helped their competitor which indirectly affected their sales as well.…7. The KFC Oprah PromotionOprah was the Queen of it all.With millions of fans around the world, when she offered everyone to get a free 2-piece chicken meal this led to a huge disaster for KFC.Over 10 million free 2-piece chicken coupons were printed out resulting in KFC losing at around $40 million due to the give away of free food.If you are a marketer, definitely use these campaigns as examples of “What Not To Do!”If you would like to follow more of my content click here!Sachin Kaushal - Business BloggerP.S.…Top 10 Worst Promotions That Lost Companies Millions Of Dollars10 Greatest Marketing Disasters in History7 Biggest Campaign Fails of 2017",15 followers,John Meyer,1.3K,0,0,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-of-the-greatest-marketing-disasters-in-history

This trip was called the “Long Way Down “.Both trips generated a huge public following , there were television series and books about their adventures and thousands of new fans. The BMW GS Adventure series of motorcycles is still the leading seller in adventure bike markets on the back of this success. Outselling all other bike brands of any kind in nearly every market in the world.

In order to sell them, Hoover began a marketing promotion in August 1992. According to the Hoover free flight promotion, a purchase of £100 of Hoovers products would make them eligible for two round -trip tickets to Europe. Later the destination of flights was expanded and included the USA. The actual cost of the same flight was several times more than £100. So, it was a very cheap bargain.Soon hundreds of people flocked to Hoover’s stores to take advantage of the offer. Hoover never anticipated such huge response and was overwhelmed by the demand due to which it could not keep its promise. This made the customers sit up and take notice and soon Hoover entered into their bad book. Later an undercover research Journalist from BBC secretly investigated and filmed the loopholes. Armed with evidence BBC created a documentary “Hoover Flight Fiasco” and aired it. The documentary led to the sacking of a number of top Hoover executives and a loss of £50 million to the company.2. Red Lobster lost $500,000 each week during a 7-week all-you-can-eat promotion in 2003. As a result of underestimating the American appetite, each restaurant started losing money on the third plate of crab legs served.Image Source:In 2003 the sea food chain Red Lobster launched its new all-you-can-eat promotion under the direction of the former head, Edna Morris. As per the promotion, the Red Lobster offered an unlimited supply of snow crab legs for a payment of $20. Along with the crab legs, they also offered an array of side dishes. For the seafood lovers, it was a godsend deal.When the executives of Red Lobster rolled out this deal they believed that people won’t eat more than three plates of crabs. Their underestimation soon came into view as people sat for hours ordering plate after plate of crab legs. At the same time, the price of crab started increasing as the US government capped a number of crabs hauled from the ocean. Soon the seafood chain started piling up huge losses. In the end, the seven-week promotion left the company with a net loss of $3.3 million.3. In 1981, American Airlines offered unlimited first-class tickets for a one-time fee of $250,000.
