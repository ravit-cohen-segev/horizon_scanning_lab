I think you have a better idea why this money is important to start any mechanical company or manufacturing plant.And Yes all these come with higher risk. So you need a better plan to survive if it gets down.I work as a freelance 3D CAD product designer in a Fiverr and what I am seeing is there are so many opportunities for mechanical engineers to earn with their 3D modeling skills and start their own business.Just have a look and see what suits you.1.3D CAD ModelingCreating a 3D model using computer-aided design software has a huge demand in the market. That was a time when only big design industry implements this 3D modeling, however, today with the boost of 3D Printing, Augmented reality and Virtual Reality people relying on customized 3D parts for their personal use.So they move to the Freelance 3D Designers to get their work done in less time as they don’t want to hire anyone for the single task.2.2D AutoCAD DrawingThey search for the person who can convert that design into two dimensions.2D drawing also extensively used in the patent filing and some government approval work. So there is a good scope of AutoCAD drawing expert as a freelancer.3.3D Package DesignThe reason Mechanical engineers don’t know now about the power of these Top Freelancing skills is that of graphics which are used in creating labels for the package. Let me tell you, you don’t have to get intimidated because many clients that come for freelance package design already have their logo and label.This happen to me much time, I just have to make a package structure in software in 3D and update it with labels provided by clients. So these skills are in huge demand for working as a freelancer.4.Mockup Design for AmazonMaking use of High-quality 3D mock-ups, they get stunning visual and also motion graphics easily. If you can think E-commerce industry is the future then this is the future skills for freelancing.5.Product SketchingFor that, a product designer who is good in initial product sketching or I can say wireframing are in huge demand not only on the freelance website for also in open job markets.6. Freehand ModelingYou need to guess the sizes of the product from the different angles with your sharp eyes and by proper assumption 3D model can be generated.I have seen many people have the actual physical product but for representation purpose, they need it in 3D format.7.Stress Analysis and SimulationThey Always look for the freelancer who can analyze their product with software such as Ansys, Hypermesh, Nastran, Solidworks simulation and on some more analysis software. Also, the cost of per Product Simulation and analysis may vary from 50$ to 200$ for less complex product and starting from 300$ for complex products.8.Full Product DesignThis kind of project might range from 1000$ to 2400$ according to Fiverr. So if you know all the above-mentioned skills of design then you might get the single but high grossing shot.9.3D file ConversionsFrom my experience on Fiverr people who are in urgent need of this file conversion are intensively searching for the quick freelancer to this kind of work. So it better to be there for the people and collect the payment as quickly as possible. The average cost of this conversion is 7$ per part and 20$ per complex part.For the wrap-up, just don’t think to procrastinate,Share with your friends and upvote if you don't know about these skills, I will update more about each in details.Join Here:This is me :",181 followers,Anuj Kumar,2.4K,55,2.7M,https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-start-a-business-as-a-mechanical-engineer

In reality, that short business step embodies far more risk, and a poor technology solution is not near the top of most lists of common reasons for business failures.In fact, a recent survey of over hundreds of small units in their starting shows that only 37% of their leaders even have strong technical backgrounds. Clearly, engineers should think twice before assuming they have an advantage over the rest of us toward being an entrepreneur.1.“Everyone loves ‘cool ideas’ and new technology.”:Before investing a lot of time and money into any idea, entrepreneurs should assess the commercial viability. That means evaluating third-party market research, getting real customer feedback from prototypes, and listening to concerns of successful executives in the same business area.2.“I need to go-it alone to assure quality and elegance.” :Engineers assume that the business issues can be resolved later. Working alone, or with other engineers, is great for the average engineer introvert, gives them better control, and minimizes distractions. A team with diverse skills is harder to manage, but more likely to build a thriving business.3.“Marketing is fluff and selling is black magic.”The old adage, “If we build it, they will come” came from engineers. In reality, building a solution won’t make it connect with customers, manage competition, or communicate and proselytize the offering in the industry. With today’s information overload, selling is always required.4.“We need to get functionality maximized before we focus on customers.”:The business reality is that you can’t engineer the functionality right UNTIL you focus on customers. Superfluous functionality, from a customer perspective, is a failure. The mantra for an entrepreneur today should be to ship fast, make changes, and iterate.5.“A good engineer hates unpredictability and risk”:“A good entrepreneur embraces risk as an opportunity, whereas most engineers are risk averse and cautious. The result is that engineer-driven solutions often are too little, too late, if they ever ship, in today’s fast moving market. Managing risk is good; eliminating risk is bad for startups.6.“We can’t worry about making money until we get it built.”:If you can’t make money, it isn’t a business.

10,"Long story ahead. Grab a bucket of popcorn.In the months of May, June, and July 2016, I was in Palo Alto, California, for my tech internship at a startup called Rubrik. My third year had just ended and Rubrik was indeed the best internship opportunity that I’d have got. I was working with their File Systems Team, working on migrating their backend database from one DBMS to another. I was working with some really smart team members and learned a lot.However, during the internship, I realized a few things:Long story ahead.

My third year had just ended and Rubrik was indeed the best internship opportunity that I’d have got. I was working with their File Systems Team, working on migrating their backend database from one DBMS to another. I was working with some really smart team members and learned a lot.However, during the internship, I realized a few things:My 7th semester at IIT Bombay was starting around late July 2016. I spoke with a couple of college friends, explaining my desire to start something of my own. One of them suggested that I should explore courses in DSSE (Desai Sethi School of Entrepreneurship) at IIT Bombay. IIT Bombay has such a large academic infrastructure that it is nearly impossible for anyone to know everything that the institute offers. I had spent 3 years at IIT Bombay and I had no idea that we had something like DSSE in the Institute.I wrote to their Project Manager and the Professor in charge and expressed my desire to start a company. In spite of my being late for the enrollment date, they were kind enough to allow me to enroll in the ENT101 course - Introduction to Entrepreneurship.When I came back to India around the end of July 2021, I started attending the ENT101 classes and I thoroughly enjoyed them. In a typical course in an engineering college, one expects slides, lectures, assignments, quizzes, and pen-paper-based exams. ENT101 was totally different. In this course, senior alums of the IITs took sessions, explaining various entrepreneurship concepts through their own entrepreneurial journey. These professors were not academic professors. They were themselves, startup founders and entrepreneurs, some of them even being billionaires themselves. They took classes to pay back to the institute.They didn’t take any exams. The mechanism of the evaluation was to see how much a student is investing time in talking to customers, building a minimum viable product, and eventually building a startup of their own. The professors focused purely on the end outcome rather than on written exams.I got an opportunity to listen to the success stories of industry veterans as well as young founders. One particularly striking story was of an IITB 2014 batch Alum (let’s call him Mohit). Mohit was just 3 years senior to me and had created a multi-million dollar company. I was extremely inspired to hear his story. I thought to myself - “Mohit is just 3 years senior to me. If he can create such a successful startup, why can’t I?”An important lesson taught in the ENT101 course was that ideally, one should partner with a co-founder when starting up. Not that solo founders don’t do well, just that partnering with a co-founder makes life a little easier. I started thinking about who to partner with. A natural choice was to find someone in the friend circle. Most of my friends, including myself, came from a relatively humble background and so, convincing someone to forget about the thought of a high-paying job, and start a company, was quite difficult.I realized that if there is someone who would not think twice before leaving the idea of a job, then that would be my friend Soham, who stayed 2 rooms away from me at Hostel 3 - yes, the same Hostel 3 that you saw in the movie Chhichhore. I had the privilege to spend 3 years of my life at Hostel 3!I spoke with Soham and as expected, he was up for the idea. Both of us had internships from fantastic companies and both our companies had extended us pre-placement offers. This meant that we had a full 1 year of time (the 4th year of college) to experiment on various startup ideas. In fact, we had a really good situation:Yes, I am thankful to IITB for providing such a flexible curriculum!Soham and I took multiple entrepreneurship courses:One important thing we learned was thatOne needs to understand what the market wants, and then one should build a product (or technology) around it.This single important lesson changed our thinking perspective and we both started looking for problem statements. One interesting problem statement that came up was that in spite of so many apps for ordering food (Swiggy, Zomato), purchasing items (Amazon, Flipkart), or ticket booking (IRCTC, MMT), parents still can’t use these apps easily and rely on their children. I personally faced this because my parents always take my help in such things.We started validating this problem statement. We spoke with a bunch of people including our parents, friends, professors, etc. We figured out that the problem statement is quite a large one. This whole problem statement discovery exercise was a part of the course Technology Venture Creation. For the course, we started presenting this idea as the project.We started thinking of solutions to the above problem and an idea that struck us was that we can potentially create an IVR (phone call) based mechanism where parents can simply call a standard 1800 kind of number, and talk to an intelligent voice assistant, and speak their query. The voice assistant would be powered by Natural Language Understanding (NLU) technology and would be able to help parents order food, book a cab, order from Amazon or Flipkart, and book tickets.When we presented this idea in our course Presentation, the feedback we got was that we will have to stretch ourselves to acquire customers and it will require heavy funding. Therefore, we should consider licensing this technology to businesses that already have acquired customers. The idea sounded quite interesting to us - not only would we avoid the hassle of acquiring customers but also we will be able to monetize easily.Another interesting learning in one of the courses (Marketing for Entrepreneurs) was that we should chase customers rather than investors. We all always hear the news around IITians getting millions of dollars in funding from investors. It is easy to get swayed away with the core focus and divert one’s attention towards raising funds. However, based on the course learning, we always stayed away from any kind of VCs or institutional funds.Through the contacts of the professors, we started to meet some institutions to see how we can partner with them and co-create the product with them. We started converging on a single market segment - Financial Services. It seemed quite big, a possible multi-million dollar opportunity.We met executives at some of the large financial institutions:The idea was toThis whole customer interaction exercise really changed our thinking process. We realized that if we just talk to customers and get feedback, we can build the right product extremely easily.Our initial idea was to build an IVR (phone call) based voice assistant for enterprises. However, we realized that the 1800 number was a HUGE customer support channel for these large organizations and they didn’t really want to trust two kids of 21 years old each, on technology for such a large platform. Most explained that they were exploring chat and chatbot-based solutions that that’s where they can experiment with us and see if we are relevant for them.One of the above banks agreed to do a pilot with us on one of their internal employee-facing mobile application where they wanted a chatbot solution wherein their employees can ask basic product-related queries. Their employee base was huge and so, new employees need to be trained on their product portfolio. If these new employees need some help, they call their managers or the back office for assistance. This large bank wanted us to automate this via a chatbot within the app.We found this use-case interesting and started working on the pilot. However, we later realized that we were being taken for granted. When we spoke about a possible commercial engagement for the pilot, we were told that the bank expected this to be an academic project for no charge. Obviously, we were quite disappointed with that and stopped working on the project. This whole episode happened around February 2017. This was when we were still in the 8th semester of college.Towards the end of March 2017, one of the professors introduced us to the Head of the Innovations team at SBI. He liked our concept and told us to apply for an application via their portal. We went back to the hostel room and started the application only to realize that it was mandatory to have a company incorporated. I called up one of my cousins, who’s a CA, and requested him to help us incorporate the company. SBI told us to get the application process completed before they can proceed with our evaluation.On 21st April 2017,When we went back to the Innovations Head, he had forgotten us completely. Obviously, we were shocked because of thisDaily we used to travel from Powai to Belapur, 30+ kms one side. Those who stay in Mumbai would know how hot and humid the weather is during the April and May months. On top of that, we had to wear formal clothes.In a few days of time, the Innovations Head understood that we are determined to get a business from him and we won’t leave him like this. He finally called us and told us to make a proof-of-concept (POC) of a simple chatbot that can answer loan-related queries. He told us that if we deliver well, they will launch the chatbot on the 1st of July 2017, the bank’s foundation day, and also the last year of their tech-savvy Chairperson Ms. Arundhati Bhattacharya.We were in the sky hearing this! We were given a timeline of 2 - 3 weeks to build the POC. We came back within a week to show him the solution. He tried it and really liked it. He saw our enthusiasm and agreed to take this forward. He showed a demo of the end solution to his seniors and they all liked it. We were extremely delighted to know that the project was being taken forward.This was around the end of May 2017. I had my joining at Rubrik on 27th June. Soham’s joining at Indeed (the job search company) was around the same time. We both realized that if SBI gives us a contract around mid-June, we will be able to focus full-time on building AllinCall. So, we started accelerating the whole process.We started working on the final product version with the SBI team, refining the product and preparing for deployment of the Software in SBI servers. In the deployment process, we learned a lot of new things - UAT, Production, Web Server, App Server, Database Server, Secure Code Deployment, Vulnerability Assessment, Penetration Testing, Application Security, and whatnot! SBI had an Information Security Department which did a hell lot of testing on our code and pointed out some 4500 open observations. Needless to say, we were shocked to see this.Soham was extremely passionate about cybersecurity in college and he knew a lot of these things. Within 3 days, he had closed all the 4500 observations. To date, I am surprised how he did that!In parallel, I was working on the documentation and paperwork with the SBI team. They needed a lot of documents around our technical architecture, data flow, technology, use-case, best practices, analytics, etc. They needed a formal commercial proposal (quote) also. In parallel, the process was initiated for the Non-disclosure Agreement (NDA) and Service Level Agreement (SLA). All of these things were totally new to us. We did a lot of Google searches and picked up some of these.In between, unfortunately, Soham’s grandmother expired and so, he had to rush to Ahmedabad for her last rites. It was a difficult period for us because effectively, half of our bandwidth was gone. In between, I had some rounds of negotiations with the SBI team. Their GM who was negotiating with us had an experience almost equal to Soham and my age combined. Needless to say, they negotiated hard on a bunch of things - pricing model, payment schedule, licensing, and the overall numbers. We didn’t know much here and so, we went with the flow.Around 27th June, we were ready for deployment and on 1st July, as per the planned date, the solution was launched for SBI. SBI Team did a grand celebration of their Foundation day and we also got a spot. We were honored by the CIO and CTO of the State Bank Group. For us, it was a great starting point.Getting the largest bank in the country as the first customer, was indeed a great achievement for us. SBI gave us a launchpad which we could have never got elsewhere. We got extremely good support from the SBI officials and they guided us throughout the process.SBI issued a certificate in the name of our company, signed by their CIO.In August 2018, 1.5 months after the SBI chatbot launch, we graduated from IIT Bombay. It was a proud moment for our parents that we were able to acquire such a large enterprise client before even graduating from college.The Head of Innovations was kind enough to put a word to SBI Group companies and SBI Life immediately invited us for a demo. They were evaluating partners for chatbot, but a reference from SBI helped them finalize on us quickly. Today, many SBI Group companies are our clients - SBI Life Insurance, SBI Mutual Fund, SBI Cap Securities, SBI General Insurance.I have even taken sessions with SBI Team where they wanted us to share our learnings with their young team members from the IT side.I also got an opportunity to meet with other senior SBI officials at their PBBU (Personal Banking Business Unit) Conclave in Goa.Later, AllinCall rebranded as Cogno AI.

His exit process happened amicably and we still remain good friends - there was no reason for us to create a conflict.

12,"I’m the founder ofI’m the founder ofThe start and the uncertainty:Here a few pictures from that phase:PIC 1: Here’s Suraj initially after moving back. Our first office. We shared it with our partner’s other businesses. Late nights working across one table were the normHere is another pic right after our first year of operations. Our students made it to universities like Stanford, Yale, Duke, Cornell, UPenn and scores of others. We proved our mentorship model worked and hence decided to shoot a corporate video. A memorable day when we enjoyed our initial success.P.S. I enjoyed sitting with the team one one table and pushing ahead together. Memorable times that will never come back!The middle phase of scaling, stability and scrapping each day:Here’s a picture from one of our first on campus sessions. We had to request the management of the college and hardly 10 people showed up. Yet we gave it our all! We still took pride in taking the session because we wanted the 10 people to benefit.People began noticing the quality of our work. We were invited to other cities for sessions. Crowds slowly began to grow.And eventually we began to fill out bigger auditoriums. Our customer base greatly increased because we persevered and were on the road interacting with them.Our annual revenue went past the crore mark. I was getting invited to panels to talk about how startups can be scaled. This was surreal considering how uncertain I was when we started off!and then came the hit.How long will it last? Will people even care about career counselling and foreign university applications? We just hired new team members, how will we pay them if revenues are halted?? At that point we were prepared for the worst.However, good planning was about to pay off. We are immensely profitable as I said. So we had money in the bank to tide over a few months. Sales crashed and we were dependant on the money in the bank. We kept offering resources to help students tackle the uncertain times. We helped give them direction and never abandoned them. This increased their trust in us. Our success record over 2 years helped us referrals started to pour in. Everyone wanted to speak to our team to find answers. We always worked hard to give them the answers. Come June, money started flowing back in. Because we were an online platform that could be accessed from anywhere, our sales volume grew greatly. People from all over the world were reaching out.From a phase where we didn't know how long we could retain our employees, we started to hire and hire fast. We had staff from across the country working with us. We rode out the wave and then ran into one minor problem.Our room was no longer going to be large enough for us. No way.Here’s a glimpse of our new placeThe day we opened up was among the proudest days for me. A lot of the work had paid off and we were running an exciting company. Here’s me with my partners through thick and thin from day 1.And with my family. A super satisfying day!So our size has changed. We see a lot more PPTs than earlier (A sure sign of growth :P).

This day was no different.However, the subject of the speech seemed to be me. Bob started listing off all the things that he didn’t like about me.Then, at exactly 1:15PM, the HR VP, Carlos, asked me to go with him. “Take your stuff,” he said to me.I knew right then and there I was being fired, and the twenty other people in the boardroom knew I was being fired too.The division I had been running was losing money when I took it over. Within three years, it was the most profitable division of the company.Yet, I was being fired.The truth is I was coasting. I knew probably two years before I was fired that I had done all I could do at this company.I had turned around a completely dysfunctional division. There was no more left for me to do. And I wasn’t going to get promoted any time soon.So I was coasting because there wasn’t anything left to do. I should have started looking around for something else to do but I got lazy and complacent.Getting fired woke me from my slumber.I spent the weekend thinking about what I wanted to do next. I had several options. I could work as a senior executive at another public company in my space, or I could work for a startup, or maybe I could start my own company.Now, I’d love to tell you that I just decided over that weekend to start my own company, but it didn’t happen that way. Read on…I sent an email to my network of executives, friends, and VCs saying I was available.The email led to lots of meetings and interviews. The interviews with companies felt like it would be just another job. I’d do it if nothing else popped up, but that just wasn’t very interesting to me.In parallel, I was meeting with my VC contacts. One of the people I knew was the managing partner of a large San Francisco VC fund. Mike asked me to come up to the city and spend the day with him.When I got there, Mike went right to the point. “We’re interested in building an Analog Semiconductor company (my expertise), and we’d like you to help us. Are you interested?”The opportunity to build a company got me unbelievably excited. This was exactly what I wanted to do!So there I went from sleepwalking through I job that I didn’t like, to getting fired, to getting the opportunity to do exactly what I wanted to do. How lucky could I get?The VC fund brought me on as an Entrepreneur in Residence (EIR). It was a great experience. I learned the ins and outs of working with VCs, plus I had my first investor (the VC fund I was working with) lined up, or so I thought (that’s another story).I have being fired to thank for the crazy, wonderful journey I embarked on.There were enough twists and turns from getting fired, to becoming an EIR, to having my original founding team walk out and steal my IP, to starting fresh with a new founding team, to having 63 VCs reject us, to surviving The Great Recession and getting funded, to successfully building our company, and then being forced to sell the company that you could make a movie about it. I wouldn’t change any of it except for maybe being forced to sell the company :-).So to Bob, the CEO who fired me, I say, “Thank you. Thanks for giving me the opportunity to pursue the opportunity to work with the best team of people I had the pleasure of working with in my career. I couldn’t have done it without your help.”For more, read:",18 followers,Asim Qureshi,2.2K,996,155.5M,https://www.quora.com/How-did-you-start-your-own-startup-How-did-you-choose-the-idea

Most industries were operated from bigger cities and already had their software coming from there. So the website was the least of worries for them. (i am talking about the year 2008).Since business did not go the way, we started looking for ideas. Our city had just turned into an SEZ area. As a result, real estate prices were at an all-time high (in fact, it was more than some of the tier 1 cities in India).We decided to launch a web portal byWe sold three levels of subscriptions, with each level providing a web page (1–2 or 3) on our portal along with images of shops, email id, etc.We hired a few sales guys who went with us in closing sales. Also, we bought a camera to click pictures of shops, etc.It was one hell of an experience pitching a web portal to business owners who did not even have an email id.Within a few months, we had sold 300+ subscriptions, and the banner space was sold out on all the major categories and home pages.Our popularity led to many other new portals starting in the city based on our business model, which was good for us as it made others realize the difference between what they offered and what we offered.Moreover, it ensured we stayed grounded and did not get complacent.We provided every business owner with a unique design (there was no CMS., only a simple HTML/CSS page or every business done by my brother).The popularity portal gained within a short time span surprised us. Soon the business owners in the city started using the web link provided by usWe added more services like real estate and job portals to our portal.The portal did amazing for around 1–2 years before the real estate market crashed. (it was our main cash cow. While others contributed their bit, real estate companies bought most ad space on our portal).And then I moved to another city to further grow our IT services business.Since then, I have worked with quite a few startups, but nothing beats our success with our first startup and how well it did in a concise time frame.

Let me try and put various important aspects which needs to be considered while planning for such an idea.I believe in sharpening my Axe with 80% of effort and 20% in actually cutting a large tree. This philosophy goes well while starting a prospective large business. A start up founder needs to consioulsly analyse various things before taking the plungess. Having said that there are people who have built an new areroplane after jumping from a cliff.11. Figure out the right value proposition and customer needs and aspirations. Design the product/service for the future and involve customers at every stage. Here proper filtration is require to incorporate real feedback and cut the noise.Having figured out these things, you have to ask yourself many questions for you to be completed convinced and committed to your concept. Most important question for me was: how long?, At what cost?, Why this? Can I ?2. Build the right cofounding team: take time if it requires so so find out the right person. Make sure that the founding team brings mutually exclusive and the combined skill covers your core competencies.3. Build the initial team of mentors, advisors, full time team, customer advocates and influencer base carefully. There is 90% chance that the start up will fail and you need loyal and passionate people on whom you can trust.4. Market is the biggest teacher. Make your development process as agile as possible to handle any disruption, make decisions quickly and move fast.5. Find right kind of capital and investor: do your own research on what kind of capital you want and who are the investors who can partner with you in your journey. The entrepreneur-Investor relationship should be based out of mutual belief and trust.6. Customer service and satisfaction is the key: most of the start ups don't focus on this factor. But this is the factor which might guarantee long term success. Invest time, money and effort to understand and solve customers query and problems. Be honest with him7. Build a culture that suits your offering: The culture is defined from the very first day. The initial 10 members will define how your stakeholders react and respond to future actions the company and management takes8. Last but not the least,Hustle, execute, fall fast and hard , learn to stand-up and run fast. Entrepreneurship is challenging and it's good to have friends , family and we'll wishers in loop who can say.. it's okay to fall and stand up.Lastly from my inspiration: follow your heart, it somehow knows what you want.

When I returned to India, I wanted to do something meaningful and I felt that there was a dearth of play areas, good ones which could boast of international safety standards. A mother of two daughters, I was always disappointed that if I took my daughters anywhere myself or let them go to the birthday parties in a play area or an arcade or a water park as a matter of fact they’ll end up getting sick and missing school. So, I worked on this idea and started working on building a play area for kids and learned the nuances of the business, left no stone unturned and used my expertise from the kids learning perspective and play which is missing in today’s times.So opening this one play area gave me the wings I needed and people started contacting me from across India to help them setup their play areas and that’s how my journey of my startup began. We are the pioneers in the field of play area consulting, the play experts, and we take pride in the fact that it’s our passion and we put our souls into making each project the way it is, beautiful and intricate with details as well as making it profitable.And we help our clients every step of the way, making them save, money, time and energy and along with it exceptional ROI within a year of being operational and massive profits along with the joy this business brings in.So this startup idea came from the need of people and our hearts…",22 followers,Nishchal Arora,9.2K,131,3.6M,https://www.quora.com/How-did-you-start-your-own-startup-How-did-you-choose-the-idea

But that includesSo about half (10% of the total) is going into services, software, and content.  But that includesThat is a lot of money, but given that over 90% goes elsewhere, does that signal an ""obsessed"" industry?  And if the other 90% is underfunded, are they seeing the outsized returns you'd expect?  (Ask a cleantech investor that question...)Now let's turn to anecdotal evidence.  Let's look at the deals that my investor (Benchmark Capital) has announced over the last year:Hortonworks - big data software and servicesThey all can be billion dollar businesses, impact millions of users, and disrupt large markets.  The portfolios of other top tier firms look similar.Despite the multitude of fun, buzzy apps and games getting media coverage and popping up in app stores, the lion's share of the talent and money in the industry is going into very large opportunities.  This is the ""dark energy"" of the industry that most people don't see if they rely on Fast Company as their reference.But would they be doing even better if they weren't missing a huge opportunity right in front of them?  That gets us to:2.  Is technology transfer a huge opportunity that we are missing?I don't have lots of firsthand experience here, so I'll defer toI will add, though, that the market works via ""pull.""  Entrepreneurs discover customer problems and search for solutions.  If the solutions need new tech, that tech can be licensed from universities, from other companies, open source, or developed in house.""Find the best tool for the job"" always beats ""find a job for this tool.""   And this always means the simplest technology.  Not the more ""complex"" technologies you refer to.But even this requires entrepreneurs entering the market and discovering customer problems.  So let's ask:3.  Are too many entrepreneurs working on ""trivial"" apps?Let's say you take three really smart computer science grads.  They create a fun photo sharing app.  They get a few million users and sell the company for $10M to Facebook.  They stay for a while, leave, then start a new opportunity.What happened here?Our grads built something lots of people liked whose lives were improvedSo, we can probably agree that is not bad.But what was the opportunity cost?  Could this team have achieved even more with their time, talent, and $250K of Ashton Kutcher's money?  Wouldn't we be better off if they invented a solar cell that is 90% efficient?Well, they weren't going to invent that solar cell.  They don't have the education, experience, or passion.  But plenty of entrepreneurs, billions of investment, and deep scientific and domain experience are already deep into that market.  Probably right down the street.Our team probably would have ended up buried deep into Google, Goldman Sachs, or GE earning a steady wage.But when Vivek Wadhwa fires off his weekly, self-righteous tweet sniffing that entrepreneurs aren't working on problems he deems to be impactful, he is not criticizing the 9-5 IBM'er.  He's criticizing our three entrepreneurs who have added more value, learned more, and had more of an adventure in their 18 months than many people do in a decade at an established institution.  And with less money than the weekly budget for private jets at IBM.I think their time was well spent and they are off to bigger and better things.  Even if you believe their app was ""trivial.""  But was it?4.  Are they really that trivial in the first place?We can agree that trivial problems exist.  I'm not going to defend ""Asian Boobs.""But there are two things to think about:1.  People's lives are improved by fun apps and games, in the same way they are by movies, music, food, and books.  We don't usually ask why people waste time in those fields.  Kirsten Dunst is never asked why she makes movies instead of working on gene therapy.  Nor do we suggest that we stop making movies because we already have plenty of those.2.  And, what starts out as trivial often ends up being the most impactful of all, asLarge, disruptive ideas start with teams who jump into the game, start with small, tangible problems, then grow and expand from there.But that requires their getting into the game in the first place.  They need a starting point of something that feels achievable and caters to their passions and aptitude.And they need encouragement.  They don't need criticism from various pundits and hangers-on who deem them to be working on the wrong problem.  Especially since many of the pundits don't work on them either.I applaud anyone who takes a risk to solve a problem that they and their customers care about.  And there is plenty of room for that across a wide spectrum of problems.

If you're a VC firm, you're phasing out your life sciences division.The title of Steve's article is simply: Why Facebook is Killing Silicon Valley.http://steveblank.com/2012/05/21/why-facebook-is-killing-silicon-valley/On the one hand - it's an honor to be in the company of great minds like Steve Blank. On the other - it's sad that this is the current state of early stage life sciences and technology investing. As Steve says:> And for Silicon Valley the investor flight to social media marks the beginning of the end of the era of venture capital-backed big ideas in science and technology.Steve's post is definitely more eloquent - and I would encourage everyone who participated in this debate to read it.------------ Original Answer: November 18, 2011 -------------------------I wasn't going to dive into this one - but then I changed my mind ;-)  Warning:  very long answer - so either grab a coffee - or bounce to the next question.SV (and the U.S. more generally) is fascinated (if not obsessed) with small ideas because they're typicallyeasier- and because the odds offinancial successare just way better than tackling some of the larger - more systemic problems.  Three big ones that come to mind (in no particular order) are:* Energy and dependence of foreign oil (a finite global resource at escalating costs to find/extract)I actually don't know as much about Energy and Education - but the statistics around healthcare are eye-opening and eye-popping.  This single chart (from Mary Meeker's incredible report earlier this year -U.S.A., Inc.) goes a long way to highlight the dilemma (with thanks to Gabe Ruane for the graphic refresh):I encourage everyone to read her report here: http://www.kpcb.com/usainc/I encourage everyone to read her report here: http://www.kpcb.com/usainc/Several noted economists have gone as far as to say we don't have a debt problem in this country - we have a healthcare problem.  I tend to agree.So how does this tie in to the question?  Also from earlier this year - GigaOM produced a great infographic titled:The New Startup Ecosystem.  You can see the full infographic here ( http://gigaom.com/2011/06/10/startup-ecosystem/ ) but it's the 6th graphic that highlights WHERE the rocket fuel (early stage funding) is going:This is only one data point - but we have some pretty compelling anecdotal evidence as well.  Ron Conway - one of Silicon Valley's most prolific and early stage investors has a list of startups in his current portfolio.  That list recently became public.  I've seen it in the wild before - but this is the most recent version.  The categories alone are pretty insightful - but here's the breakdown by number of companies in each:This is only one data point - but we have some pretty compelling anecdotal evidence as well.  Ron Conway - one of Silicon Valley's most prolific and early stage investors has a list of startups in his current portfolio.  That list recently became public.  I've seen it in the wild before - but this is the most recent version.  The categories alone are pretty insightful - but here's the breakdown by number of companies in each:1. E-Commerce - 45284 Companies.  That's prolific - and fairly representative of early stage Silicon Valley investing.  The Money Tree report (most often used) is also valuable - but it tends to lump Start Up/Seed AND Series A altogether - into a single category it calls Early Stage.  That's a bit broad in terms of analyzing the true early stage pipeline.So - while Healthcare represents 18% of GDP (and it is clearly NOT producing the tangible results that other countries are able to with a significantly smaller % of GDP) -true early stagehealthcare funding is a minuscule 2-3%.  The same is true of Education and Training.  In many ways - those are the foundational bookends of a culture (Education - Healthcare).  Early stage investors (and later stage VC's) are no fools.  Social Commerce, Advertising, Sales & Marketing, Data Storage and Gaming are all MUCH better (and easier) financial bets.  The casino is humming along nicely.  Almost everything OTHER than Healthcare and Education is like shooting fish in a barrel.In fact, there's another question here on Quora that's also somewhat related -Where's the best place to find a Ruby developer willing to work for 15% stake in my education startup? [ https://www.quora.com/Wheres-the-best-place-to-find-a-Ruby-developer-willing-to-work-for-15-stake-in-my-education-startup ]The #1 answer by far (with 68 votes) is this one:> I have been asked to answer this, and I am trying to do this as polite as possible.Your value proposition to a developer / technical co founder is not good. On the one hand any decent ruby developer can find a job at a funded startup that pays in the six figures and stock options and a nice view. something like this:Yeah, there are Ruby jobs even on Sunset in WeHo. Here you get the money, you get a great environment, you get stock options, you get to work with a great team.Now - dripping condescension aside - the answer is absolutely correct but it doesn't factor in anything other than a very narrow, short-term view of how we chose to spend our time on this spinning marble.  Ruby (and any number of other Computer Science skills) are in short supply - high demand.  Bravo!  Learn to program and enjoy the Sunset view (and perks) in WeHo.  Sign me up!But ... there's a longer term problem ... and it's this.  Given its current trajectory, healthcare insurance (in general what pays for actual healthcare) is getting to be a really BIG problem...","1,398 followers",Faisal Hourani,15.3K,1.1K,1.9M,https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-start-a-business-as-a-mechanical-engineer

In fact, most of the startups founded during the era those startups were founded in couldn't be founded today.Why?Because the VC world has gone from being populated largely by growth investors to being populated by momentum investors.  They aren't interesed in investing in ideas, they're interested in investing in traction.  That's the definition of a momentum investor.It's a handy Darwinian notion--let the market decide by survival of the fittest and we'll protect our risk via portfolio diversification.Once upon a time, a slideshow and a team could raise $1-3M to build a product.  That has radically changed since Dot Bomb 1.0.  At first founders had to get a product together on their ramen budget.  Then they had to show real traction and momentum with real customers on the same ramen budget.It's nearly impossible to see an SAP, Apple, Oracle, or similar company emerge from that sort of environment.  Very few companies and founding teams can exist on ramen for long enough to produce a product that can be successful enough for further funding.Just as the VC's decided their lowest risk was to invest in momentum, founders have decided their risk is to throw together minimum viable products, launch them into the market with as much social viral know how as they can muster, and hope to strike it rich.  Some do, many don't, but it's unclear whether in absolute dollar terms this is any worse for the founders than the prior iteration.However, in terms of what gets built, until the world gets tired of yet another social thing, yet another e-commerce thing, or yet another shallow ad-supported thing, don't expect much innovation.  The simple stuff sucks up all the capital and all the talent.The good news is that like any other investment community, VC's behave with punctuated equilibrium.  The current climate is a response to the gillions made off the Googles and eBays of the world.  At some point, some VC too foolish to follow their herd will make a maverick investment in a great idea and a great team and it will make gillions.  Or at least enough to put their firm and strategy on the radars.  When that happens, the herd will turn and times will have changed, at least until the next punctuated equilibrium.There's already considerable disruption as evidenced by the food fight between VC's and Angels.  That's feeding more capital back into the very early stages.  More to come.",113 followers,Bruce Lin,6.1K,82,483.7K,https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-start-a-business-as-a-mechanical-engineer

The service will distribute information via SMS.Never under estimate the power of basic communication infrastructure.People often forget that most of the deaths that occur in the less developed part of the world can be reduced simply by better communication infrastructure. Its surprising but many people do not die in the initial event but rather because of secondary issues. For example, most of the death toll of the Haiti earthquake can't be attributed to the earthquake but rather the after affects or secondary issues, for example, burst sewer mains, further contaminated drinking water, etc. Often just knowing where to get aid can be a challenge.This is an addendum.First off, tracing the source of inventions can be complicated. Just take a look at the Connections series by James Burke.Secondly, much of the developing world is not at Silicon's Valley's feet or even near it. While Mexico might be ""close"", there is so little connection between the two that it does not matter. Silicon Valley does not face the same challenges as Africa or India. It has reliable power, safe clean drinking water, great schools, etc. It isn't paradise, it does have problems but different problems. If you want Silicon Valley to invent something for the developing world, move Silicon Valley to the developing world. Personally I think that it will only do some limited good. Things that Silicon Valley invents do trickle down to the rest of the world and that is good.Here's an article on Jeffrey Sachs, a smart man with an interesting idea but ultimately he might have failed,On the other hand you have GE in India. GE realized that it had to redesign, simplify, make their products cheaper and more fault tolerant in order to have an impact in India.But how can the valley help? The truth is that the valley does help and more than they know. There are plenty of developed country inventions that have made their way into the developing world. For example, mobile money. Mobile currency is more popular in the developing world than anywhere else. This depends on advanced encryption etc.Silicon Valley likes to hack and mess with business models. This is necessary. Find a cheaper way to build things. It wasn't that long ago that the computing power in your smart phone would have cost billions. Today it doesn't. Things like Raspberry PI and other such simple circuits will be used to do more good (and possibly evil) in the developing world than anywhere else. Share that knowledge with open courses. Make WiFi and the internet free (both in terms of beer and speech).Lastly, stop trying to dictate what the world needs, give people the tools and let them do it on their own.
