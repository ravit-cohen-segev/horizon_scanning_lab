1,"We do.And sure enough, many lose interest halfway through.Or, my case, NTs make us lose them. Because we are awkward, straightforward, frank, stim-y, misreact, and prefer work over socialising.It depends on the Aspie level. Some profound Aspies get absorbed in work, and apart from the occasional stimming, they get through work just fine -if no NT around them gets jealous, of course. Others, more 'functional', may struggle more on the social part, and although we like routine, repetition tasks often piss off an Aspie.But yes, we work. Who told you we didn't?","1,147 followers",Annie Kent,7.6K,334,651.1K,https://www.quora.com/Where-can-I-learn-graphic-design-skills-online
2,"People with Asperger’s can work, however it’s very difficult for them to a. find jobs they want [if they want a job in the first place, that is], b. get the job they want and c. keep the job they want. Some people with Asperger’s find the job they want to do and are able to get it and that’s fine. Some people with Asperger’s end up getting 20 or 30+ jobs that don’t last very long.

Some people with Asperger’s find the job they want to do and are able to get it and that’s fine. Some people with Asperger’s end up getting 20 or 30+ jobs that don’t last very long. Some people with Asperger’s are unable to find any jobs at all, let alone jobs that suit them.There’s a number of difficulties an Aspie might face when looking for a job -What do the employers want? Usually an employer will have certain skills requirements, certain expectations of their employees, which may include working well in a team, which would require social skills, or the ability to adapt to change.There’s problems with this straight away. An Aspie may have a great set of skills for one type of job, or the job might involve working with their special interest, in which case the Aspie will have a ton of knowledge about that interest. But then, what if they’re suddenly moved to a completely different position? What if that new position requires a different set of skills altogether? Skills that Aspie might not necessarily have. Aside from liking predictability and not liking being surprised with things, that would make certain changes highly impractical for an Aspie. Then there’s the social skills - Aspies tend to struggle with reading facial expressions, body language, etc. and can often be very blunt. Also, in group conversations they may not see when they get a turn to speak, in which case two things could happen - they could be interrupting people in order to say their piece, or they could completely miss any opportunities to speak. So team work may not be the best scenario for an Aspie.Also, there’s the working environment - does the Aspie need to sit in a certain place, do they need certain levels of noise, or lighting, or ways to deal with any sensory issues?

3,"Can people with mild autism work? Yes! Some can even be really high functioning in the workplace.

The majority of people with autism do not have jobs, though a large, even majority of these people are on the more severe end of the spectrum and have difficulties taking care of themselves.But employment is more difficult for people even on the mild end too because of sensory difficulties and communication issues among other pitfalls of having a job.

4,"Many of us can. Not all by any stretch.The real challenge is finding work that suits us. I lucked out in finding a path that reasonably suited me early (electronics tech) which eventually led me to my ‘calling’ (Clinical Engineering).So, yes, we can. I don’t know how many others have jobs, but it doesn’t seem to be a high percentage.",UNKNOWN,Travis,1.2K,247,1.4M,https://www.quora.com/Can-people-with-Asperger-s-work-Do-most-of-them-have-jobs
