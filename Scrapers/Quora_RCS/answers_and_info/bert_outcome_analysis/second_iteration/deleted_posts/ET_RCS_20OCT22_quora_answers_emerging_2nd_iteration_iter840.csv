He can’t remove his helmet either, as he inhales toxic fumes he uses to survive.Other kinds of Space Marines aren’t able to remove their armor because they“All is dust...All is dust...All is dust...All is dust...All is dust...All is dust...” - Official slogan of the Rubric Marines.Those are all the instances I know of, hope you find this answer helpfulEdit:Thanks to Ian Friskus for reminding me of Dreadnoughts.Want to keep purging heretics, Xenos and mutants/killing and maiming loyalists as a Space marine but you’ve been mortally wounded?

Usually when a Marine is critically injured during combat but is still alive to be saved, they are put inside Dreadnoughts. Tech marines take great care of Dreadnoughts, saying preservation prayers, applying sacred oils and fixing any damage it might have sustained in combat.

Taken from Wikipedia)So, an unarmored space marine is about 7ish to 8ish feet tall, weighs somewhere in the neighborhood of 700 pounds, and has a plethora of implanted organs.The list goes something like this:-Ossmodula. Implanted at the base of the brain, this results in the rapid growth of the skeleton into something that eventually becomes much stronger than human bones. Also has a completely solidified and fused ribcage, that is proof against modern small arms.-Betcher’s Gland. Implanted in mouth. Turn’s a marine’s saliva into a corrosive acid when triggered. Able to kill enemies outright.-Omophagea. Implanted into spinal cord. Allows the marine to gain part of a person or creature’s memories by eating its flesh. Allows the marine to essentially gain tactical information about a new world just by OMNOMNOMING some local wildlife.-Sus-an Membrane. Implanted into cranium, and eventually becomes part of marines neural pathways. Used to let the marine enter a state of suspended animation, keeping him alive for years with no food or water despite mortal wounds. Longest survival time is 567 years of hibernation.-Mucranoid. Implanted in nervous system. Responds to specific stimuli and secretes a waxy substance through pores that seals the marine’s skin. This can protect them from vacuum as well as other extremely harsh environments.-Biscopea. Supercharges muscular development.-Catalespean Node. Implanted in brain stem. Allows the Astartes to turn off parts of brain sequentially, while remaining awake and alert. Essentially removes short-term need for sleep. Longest awake in active combat is 328 hours.-Sinew Coils. Boosts strength immensely. Space Marine can crush human skull in one hand, can punch through flak armor and pulverise the man inside, and bite through metal cables.-Oolitic Kidney. Implanted in abdominal cavity. Acts as emergency detox system. Space Marines are already highly resilient and adaptive towards nearly all conventional toxins and poisons, but in event of catastrophic poisoning beyond his body’s normal abilities to cope, this can flush his system.-Larraman’s Organ. Creates artificial blood cells that clot blood. Cells act extremely quickly, preventing nearly all blood loss and infection from wounds. Marines have lost limbs, only to have them clot within several minutes, and were able to continue combat operations.-Secondary Heart. Implanted in chest cavity. Enhances performance by providing more oxygen and nutrients. Capable of acting as a redundant heart in case of primary heart failure.(Taken from Warhammer Art)In any case, Space Marines also have extremely fast reaction times and movement speeds, able to swat hypersonic shells out of the air with a sword, able to cross a room and decapitate a person with a backhand before any other human in the room could react, and other such overpowered nonsense.They might as well be using speed hacks and aimbots.Once again, their body is literally small arms proof. Well, small arms as in pistols and what not anyway. Though, I’d imagine that even an AK-47 would have difficulty actually damaging a Space Marine. In this case, the assault rifle would actually have an adequate chance of penetrating the marine’s skin and bones, but the extremely rapid clotting, redundant organs and just the sheer mass of the marine’s bones and muscles would mean that even full magazines from an assault rifle would have difficulty bringing this behemoth down. Think Polar Bear, but genetically engineered from the ground up to be as durable and lethal as possible.And that’s assuming the marine just stands there and takes several magazines of rifle ammo to the chest. One of the things almost everyone keeps forgetting is the Astartes’ movement speed.(Taken from Lexicanum)They sprint at 30–50kmph, can turn on a dime, are capable of leaping several meters in the air, and have reflexes good enough to catch bullets and throw them back at people.I’d say that a naked space marine could relatively easily wipe out a whole squad of AK-47 armed soldiers. Heck, he could probably take a whole platoon, special weapons included. Rocket launchers are about the only things that could kill him in one hit, and last time I checked, they weren't designed to hit human-sized targets, hauling ass towards the firer at 30kmph.…Do I even need to mention the Lion here?The marine weighs twice as much as it does, for one thing, let alone the absurd durability.Honestly, one of two things happens here.The lion pounces, gets caught and held in place by one hand, gets pulled closer to the marine, who then proceeds to pop open it’s brainpan, and eats it’s brain to get tactical info on the surrounding area. Why this marine would be naked while scouting, I don’t know. Maybe he’s a drunk Space Wolf that lost a bet. Who knows.The other scenario is the lion pounces, gets caught, and then the marine exclaims how cute this little kitty is. The lion is tucked under the marine’s arm, who then returns to his chapter, excited to show all his battle-brothers his new pet. The lion then becomes the chapter’s mascot, explores space, fights the enemies of the Emperor, gets gene-therapy and augments, and lives several hundred years, fathering many strong cubs.(Honorary Battle-Brother Simba, fighting Orks on Carchadon V.

Extrinsic:Everything that influences your decision and opinion is stored here (ex: why do you like certain music, food or fashion)The interesting part is this motivation usually does not last more than 3–6 months.3. Obsessions:This stores your passions but also your addictions such as being a workaholic, drugs, shopaholic and chasing stuff.When it’s on, you are not free to choose what you want anymore and will go after the obsession.# Imagination:This is the marvel of evolution, it’s what makes us human.Your imagination driver gives you creativity and adaptation.It should take control when dealing with new and complex situations that require you to think out of the box.People usually don’t let imagination driver take control and stick to their motivation driver instead, which leads them to lose out on big innovations.Examples:These mistakes happened because the people in charge relied on their motivation driver which only thinks from what it already knows - if they had used their imagination driver, they can see a future that Steve Jobs saw.When your imagination driver is taking control, you feel calm and in full control.How to activate it on command? think for yourself these questions:Making yourself answer these questions in your head activates the imagination driver.In conclusion we can say that even though our brain is too complex to summarise in a Quora post, this framework gives us a better idea on how we go about our daily lives and how we can use this knowledge to live a better life.Hope this helps you as much as it helped me.I might be updating this post with more findings, follow it if you want to keep updated.All the best!","1,244 followers",Remus Serban,587,1.2K,5.6M,https://www.quora.com/How-much-in-todays-money-would-it-cost-to-create-a-single-Warhammer-40k-Space-Marine
24,"Those three goals -- ""space"", ""orbit"", and ""moon"" — are very different from each other. Let's look at each one in turn.First, we need to mention something called ""The Rocket Equation."" It mathematically encapsulates the notion that rocket fuel is heavy, so that if you need to add 100 pounds of rocket fuel to lift your payload and rocket body, then you may need 50 extra pounds of fuel just to lift that 100 pounds of fuel; and then another 25 pounds of fuel to lift that 50 pounds of fuel; and then another 12.5 pounds of fuel to lift that 25 pounds; and so on.

Let's look at each one in turn.First, we need to mention something called ""The Rocket Equation."" It mathematically encapsulates the notion that rocket fuel is heavy, so that if you need to add 100 pounds of rocket fuel to lift your payload and rocket body, then you may need 50 extra pounds of fuel just to lift that 100 pounds of fuel; and then another 25 pounds of fuel to lift that 50 pounds of fuel; and then another 12.5 pounds of fuel to lift that 25 pounds; and so on. The rocket equation says that the fuel requirements increase exponentially with payload weight, which is why it's super critical to cut down on weight as much as possible, and to increase fuel efficiency as much as possible. It is also why rockets tend to be so BIG; and why, if you want to double the rocket's speed, you need to MORE than double the fuel it carries.It also explains why a lot of rockets are launched in ""stages"". When the lower stage (which is just a big fuel tank) runs out of fuel, it becomes dead weight. Weight is bad, so they detach the lower stage and let it fall back to earth.But you probably wouldn't need a staged rocket if all you wanted to do was to ""reach"" space. By that I mean, a ""straight-up"" and ""straight-down"" mission. The German V2 rocket was able to reach the boundary of space as early as 1944 (reaching 109 miles altitude). It was 45 feet tall and weighed 12,500 kg. Most of that (8,400 kg) was fuel, to support a 1,000 kg payload. With a smaller payload, an amateur rocket today could reduce those size and weight numbers. They haven't yet quite done it (the current amateur record is 73.1 miles), but I do think it's going to happen.The next step -- orbit -- is a VERY BIG step. The V2 rocket which reached 109 miles basically went straight up, slowed to a stop, then fell back down due to gravity; just as if you threw a baseball straight up in the air (only much higher). In contrast, in order to achieve orbit, you first have to reach altitude, and then start traveling horizontally at a pretty enormous speed: about 17,500 mph. At that particular speed, in 1 second you travel horizontally about 5 miles, and at the same time the earth's gravity pulls you downward about 16 feet. This ratio of horizontal movement to vertical displacement just about exactly matches the curvature of the earth, which means you nicely remain at the same altitude above the earth's surface, as long as you keep moving at that speed. That's how orbits work.But because of that high speed, orbits take a LOT more energy -- and hence fuel -- than a ""straight up and down"" mission. To simply reach an altitude of 100 miles, requires (ideally) about 1.6 ""megajoules"" per kilogram (a megajoule is a unit of energy). In contrast, the energy required to accelerate to orbital speed (once you've reached altitude) is about 31 megajoules per kilogram.So, it takes about 20 times as much energy to get into orbit, as it takes to simply reach outer space. That means 20 times as much fuel, and a much bigger, probably staged, rocket.And we haven't talked about guidance. Going straight up and down doesn't require much fancy guidance -- at most, maybe a gyroscope. You basically just need to go straight up, more or less, until you run out of fuel, and then let gravity take over. But to get into ORBIT, you need not only to reach altitude, but also change your vehicle's direction and thrust, while continuously monitoring your speed and altitude, until you are moving at just the right speed and direction. You have a little bit of wiggle room; if you're going too fast, you'll be in a lopsided orbit but still OK. If you're going to slow, or pointed wrong, you're doomed.So your rocket is also going to need a guidance computer and automated guidance controls on board. Now it's getting fancy. Organizations like the Planetary Society, whom I guess you could call ""amateurs"", might be able to fund something like this, but it would be an expensive undertaking requiring the help of a lot of experts and professionals.Now, going to the moon...If you just want to HIT the moon, the energy requirement are (surprisingly) not that much greater than reaching earth orbit. In fact, it requires (ideally) just twice the energy to reach the moon as to orbit the earth. This is mainly because the earth's gravity starts diminishing pretty quickly as you get farther and farther away from it.But that still means a rocket at least twice as big as your orbiter, which was already twenty times bigger than your ""up and down"" rocket. The guidance system would of course have to be much more complex than your orbiter, since you are now aiming at something 240,000 miles away. And this is just for a crash landing; a soft lander or a lunar orbiter would be enormously more complex. I think at this point we are moving outside the realm of what could reasonably be called ""amateur.""",1 follower,Rodney Price,730,3.7K,10.4M,https://www.quora.com/How-much-in-todays-money-would-it-cost-to-create-a-single-Warhammer-40k-Space-Marine

This is how much the rocket can change itsThe CSXT rocket had a launch weight of 724 lb and a propellant weight of 435 lb, and an isp of 212.5 s, giving it a delta-V of about 1.9 km/s.It reached space, at an altitude of 120 km. But to get to orbit, a rocket must get several hundred kilometers up, AND a sideways speed of 7.8 km/s, requiring a total dV of about 9.5 km/s. To reach orbit, a rocket with a similar per-stage mass ratio and ISP would need five stages, each of which could be 10x bigger than the one before it (if 75% of each stage’s dry mass is the actual stage, and 25% is the payload, i.e. the stage above it). To put a 10 kg payload into orbit, we would need a 1000 ton rocket! This is utterly impractical, so we need to achieve much better engine efficiency (ISP) and mass ratios, which means liquid-fueled engines (and probably dealing with liquid oxygen), or more energetic solid fuel mixtures, higher chamber pressure, etc, either of which is inherently much more dangerous and much more expensive.Another problem is control. To go vertical to space and return, you basically just need a rocket with a set of fins on it that aerodynamically stabilizes the vehicle during early ascent and causes it to spin, so that the gyroscopic effect keeps it stable later on. But to actually reach a stable orbit, a rocket needs an active guidance system which follows a pre-planned trajectory.

We wish to make visual contact with a representative of your people.”“That would be acceptable. Send us your coordinates, and we will send down a shuttlecraft with a diplomatic staff including myself.”“Understood. We will send those coordinates. Welcome to Planet Earth.”Across the planet, news outlets reported this alien contact. The ship was moving away from China, and heading across the Pacific towards a designated location in New Mexico.The UN Security Council has announced they have appointed nine specialists to act as the official representatives. And while nobody was told of this (for fear of being detected), the US and Russian militaries have put their nuclear weapons on standby.Aboard the Star Destroyer, a technician reported to her superior officer that one of the Turbolasers appear to have been clogged with some substance in the planet’s atmosphere. They asked for permission to use a shuttlecraft to fix this issue manually. Normally, a droid would do such work, but the officers were so preoccupied examining the species’ satellite network that they signed off on it without batting an eye.As the technician entered the transport ship, she pulled a data disk from her pocket, while taking note of the proton torpedo shell she had stuffed in the back. She had to get as much Imperial technology to the planet as possible.She had heard rumours of this planet. A few smugglers from Bespin talked about it a couple years before. They had a technology, a very, very powerful technology. One that the Empire would soon discover. She had to make sure the planet wouldn’t turn it over, even if it meant blowing her undercover operation. The rebels needed a new base, and she was going to give them all that and more. She went down to the planet, but not before sending a transmission to the rebel fleet …The Imperial Representatives landed near what appeared to be a military compound, whose name was illegible. Apparently while this planet spoke basic, it didn’t read or write it.As Captain Ike stepped out of the transport craft, he mused how a planet could progress so oddly. They had virtually no presence outside their planet’s magnetic field, yet somehow they had the technology to sustain billions of humanoids. This planet's population was only surpassed by a few core worlds, yet they lived without any food imports.The Captain shook hands with one of the Earthlings. They remarked that they had never made contact with another intelligent race, let alone ones that were indistinguishable from mankind. The Captain inquired as to why there were men in bright orange bags behind them, to which the locals said that they were searching for any dangerous pathogens.Captain Ike began to ask the Earthlings about their customs, when suddenly, another Transporter landed on the planet. Quickly the lone occupant, the Imperial technician, opened the doors. Captain Ike responded in a confused manner, stating that this ship wasn’t authorized to come to the planet.The occupant arrived in a stirred manner. She began claiming that these were evil people, they were a vicious dictatorship who would kill and enslave the people of this planet. Captain Ike immediately dismissed this, stating that species who submitted peacefully to their Imperial government would not be harmed, so long as they remained loyal.The Earthlings became visibly uncomfortable. The lead Earthling stated that they never agreed to annexation. Captain Ike brushed it aside, saying they would talk more about it later: right now he had to interrogate this traitor. The Earthlings stopped him, saying they were now on their planet. One of the Stormtroopers with Ike raised their blaster. The guards around the Earthlings raised their guns …The battle above the surface of the planet was intense. While the Earthlings had no ships capable of fighting in space, they had surface-flight ships that dominated the skies, easily destroying any Imperial fighters. The rebels used this to their advantage, luring Imperial fighters and smaller ships of the main fleet into the atmosphere to be cut to pieces by F-22s.Meanwhile, on the planet, the Rebels learned what this amazing technology was: Computers. While the Empire and Rebels had some basic versions of it, a single portable device on Earth had more power than every holopad in the galaxy put together. With Rebel tech, the Earthlings only needed a couple of rotations to build a defense …Captain Ike was curious as to why the rebels cared so much about this backwater world. The only remarkable thing about it was its incredible food production capacity, something the Empire planned to make good use of. The rebels were putting a lot of what they had into this fight, which encouraged the Empire to send an additional five SDs and a host of other ships to the battle.Suddenly … the rebels retreated. All of their ships jumped into hyperspace. Ike was asked by the captains of the other ships whether they could chase them, but Ike said no. He wanted to make an example out of these Earthlings. The Earthlings couldn’t break their shields even with their strongest weapons, so the Destroyers were sent to go down and level their largest cities, seeing if that would break their will to fight. They had already razed a couple in the earlier fighting, who cared if a few more went down.Yet as they went to do that … the ships stopped. All screens onboard went down. An officer near Ike reported that everything except their communications array was being controlled from somewhere on the planet's surface.Captain Ike began to feel a pit in his stomach, as he heard a message come into the ship …“On behalf of the United Nations of Earth, Captain Ike, you and your ships are under arrest for the destruction of Chicago, Brazilia, St. Petersburg and Beijing.

Sergeant Kreel patched through: “Lord Vader, are you alright? We heard your lasers going off.” Vader replied, “Not to worry, Commander. I believe the primitive beings launched some sort of flare at me.

It appeared to be the capital, or at least a well-developed city, of this continent. As the Sentinel-class shuttles touched, down, a garrison of 100 stormtroopers jumped out, ready for combat. Suddenly, what appeared to be the planet’s militia, armed with slugthrowers and weak explosives, surrounded Vader and his men.One man stepped forward: “Drop your weapons and remove your helmets! Stand down!” Sending a message to Sergeant Kreel, telling him and his men to get ready, he ignited his crimson lightsaber. The representative of the other world stepped back, fear in his eyes. Vader spoke, “I suggest you surrender your world, if you wish to live.” Suddenly, he heard a ping as a slugthrower bullet bounced off a stormtrooper’s plastoid-composite armor. “I take it you are not surrendering, then.” He then spoke to Sergeant Kreel: “Kill them all.” The stormtroopers raised their blasters and fired with deadly aim, killing all but the man who had dared to speak. Without the Force protecting Skywalker and his friends, the stormtroopers were able to easily hit their targets. Vader marched slowly toward him, raising his lightsaber and swinging, smelling burnt flesh. He walked calmly past the bisected man, towards what appeared to be the main building of the city. As Vader and his men marched towards the White House, he was reminded of the march on the Jedi Temple, which he longed to forget.His thoughts were disturbed as an orange being came running, screaming, out of the building. Instinctively, Vader raised his hand, sending the being into a Force-induced choke hold. Looking closer, he deemed it to be of the same species of the creatures that had attacked them earlier. “Take me to your leader”, Vader said. In an accented Basic, the being proclaimed itself to be the leader of its people. Growing frustrated with the obese, arrogant creature, Vader ignited his lightsaber and cut down the man. Alerted to the death of their leader (Vader presumed), men in dark clothes and eye protection filed out of the building, turning their weapons on Vader and his men. He saw one stormtrooper go down with a well-placed sniper shot in between the plates of armor. Still, the injury was nonfatal, and Vader located the shooter before he could fire again. With a quick throw of his lightsaber, the sniper fell, headless from the roof of the building to the ground. The momentary distraction allowed one of the dark-suited men to lob an explosive. The shock jarred the Dark Lord from his train of thought, and he turned his blood-red saber on the leader’s guards.Vader marched slowly towards the men, his subconscious using the Force to throw off their aim ever so slightly. He cut and hacked, leaving at least two dozen men cut in half, with many more killed by stormtroopers. Only one remained. Vader walked calmly towards the man. Looking at the man through the crimson lenses of his helmet, Vader noticed the man could be no more than twenty-five. Still, it did not matter. This man stood between him and the Empire’s successful colonization of the planet. Clutching his hand as he had done around Captain Antilles’ neck so long ago, the man rose into the air as if by magic - which in a way it was - and started to pull at his neck. Little did he know, it would be to no avail, and in a few moments, Vader grew tired and snapped the man’s neck, putting him out of his misery.Just then, a voice patched through his helmet’s communication device: “Lord Vader, we have finished conducting our sweep of the planet. It has vast quantities of resources and they can easily be procured without many casualties.” Pleased, Vader replied: “Very well. Inform the Emperor that I have located a new planet for a labor camp.”Vader walked to his technical specialist, TK-3338, and spoke: “Begin a live broadcast to all electronic devices on this world.” After a few minutes, TK-3338 handed him a datapad, which was broadcasting all around the planet.“Today marks a new era in your primitive civilization. You have been chosen to receive the protection of the Galactic Empire. We will provide you with the gifts of plasma weapons and hyperdrives. Able men and women will be drafted into the Imperial Stormtrooper Corps. All others will work ceaselessly for the continued glory of the Empire.”20 years later…Rey raced through the wreckage of a Star Destroyer on her custom-built speeder. Out of contraband datapad downloads, she had found out that the planet used to be called Earth. Continuous mining had left the world a barren, dry, husk of a planet. However, for many years, the planet had produced materiel for the Empire’s war effort. Shortly after the Battle of Endor, Rebels in possession of Star Destroyers began protocol Base Delta Zero, attempting to raze the planet of any remaining factories that could help the crumbling Empire. Renamed, the culture and beliefs of a planet long gone mattered little to anyone now.",217 followers,Varun Warrier,3K,0,0,https://www.quora.com/How-much-in-todays-money-would-it-cost-to-create-a-single-Warhammer-40k-Space-Marine

Lawless criminal scum had discovered this planet first, bringing back tales of a pristine Human world full of technological marvels. Despite this, the world had little in the way of space defences, though their strange atomic weapons were quite capable of driving off the smugglers.But the Imperial Navy were no smugglers.They had brought a full fleet from a nearby sector to this system, intent on denying the Rebellion access to whatever tech may be found on that world.“Understood. Notify Lord Vader, I want him and the 501st on the ground to make sure this annexation goes smoothly. Keep most of our fleet just within the orbit of the system’s moon, those missiles may pose a problem so we should try and stay out of range.”Vader was to oversee the invasion of a region of the planet the locals call “United American States” or something along those lines (smugglers were never a good source of intelligence). According to the intel provided, it was this region that first hailed the smuggler’s ships and fired a good percentage of those missiles. Thrawn believed that this region was some form of local power, along with three other yet to be identified regions designated Alpha-1, Alpha-2 and Beta-1, located on the west, north and east (respectively) of the planets’s largest landmass.Admiral Thrawn was to oversee the pacification of Alpha-1 and Alpha-2 while Captain Brendol Hux was to pacify Beta-1. Forward scout vessels were sent into low orbit in order to draw the fire of the planet’s missile defence system so that the vessels located beyond range could identify the source sites and disable them via surgical orbital strikes to clear the way for the invasion force.As expected, the missiles had been launched. The point defence of the Star Destroyers was successful in destroying many of the missiles, though Thrawn noted with interest that the flight patterns and sheer number of these deadly little weapons caused many to breach the Star Destroyer’s defences and overwhelm the shields, causing multiple ships to be disabled or lost. The missiles didn’t even have to score a hit to destroy a starship, the explosion would at the very least strain the shielding of a capital ship in a wide area. Already his mind whirled with thoughts of potential applications. Detonating such a weapon in the middle of a a Rebel fighter formation would spell disaster for them.Thrawn pushed these thoughts to the side. He could ponder these new weapons later. Right now he had a job to do. The launch sites had been identified.“Lieutenant, inform the captains that I want these targets hit from orbit. Be sure that they don’t use more force than necessary, the locals will be much more cooperative if we keep casualties to a minimum”He noted with interest that some of these missiles were launched from the ocean. This could indicate some kind of undersea missile-carrying vessel. He would have to watch out for those, they would be much harder to hit.“Admiral, receiving transmissions from the region designated Alpha-1. The transmissions are sub-light, using a form of radar. It appears to be from a local leader of an entity known as the ‘French Republic’”“Understood, patch me through”The image of a Human flickered onto the screen. His pale face was slightly red, either from anger or frustration, Thrawn couldn’t tell. He noted that beneath his brown hair there was a slight gleam of sweat on the human’s forehead, a classic sign of nervousness. Behind him was a semi-circle of seats, each occupied by a other important-looking Humans.“I am Emmanuel Macron, President of the French Republic, leader of the Joint European Military. We are giving you one chance to surrender your ships and leave this solar system.”“I don’t think so, President Macron. You’re bluffing. You’ve run out of those missiles, now you’re hoping that you can scare us out of the system. But the Galactic Empire will not be so easily intimidated. I will giveThe screen went dark. One hour was just enough time for them to consider the ramifications of denying the Empire, but not enough time to formulate a counter strategy. Thrawn detested the use of such blunt force, though in this case it was necessary. If he could minimise causalities on either side by intimidating this “European Union” into joining the Empire, then integration could occur much smoother. Make no mistake, Thrawn fully intended to follow through with this threat if his demands were not met.As Thrawn waited patiently, he received news that Darth Vader had successfully taken the capital of the United States of America, though the 501st Legion had suffered heavy casualties. These Humans, with their primitive yet effective slug throwers and fabric armour, had put up a good fight. Thrawn could see potential sources for Stormtrooper recruitment in the future.Suddenly the screen turned back on. This time Thrawn was faced with an elderly female. Her defeated stance told Thrawn all he needed to know before she had even opened her mouth.“I am Angela Merkel, Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany. We accept your demands. Our armed forces have been ordered to stand down.”Thrawn let a rare smile grace his lips. Another world successfully under the banner of the Galactic Empire.TimeskipThe annexation of Earth proceeded without too many hiccups after that. The region designated Alpha-2, now known as the Russian Federation, had put up a better fight. Though ultimately they were forced to accept the Empire’s demands of annexation. Brendol Hux, like the disdainful psychopath he is, had resorted to bombing Beijing to insure the compliance of the People’s Republic of China. Thrawn had stripped him of command and ordered he be held under a military court. Vader simply choked him when they next met.After the major powers had been defeated, the minor powers fell into compliance soon enough. Resistance was still fierce, particularly in the fringe territories of the world, though most of the planet had accepted Imperial governance.Later the Empire would find out about the technological treasures this world had developed. Computers, far more effective than anything the Empire had available to them. Had the Empire not been using superluminal communication beyond Earth’s capabilities, these simple devices could have hacked the Imperial vessels, disabling them or even allowing Earth to control them remotely. It was sobering to think that such a small world could have brought the Imperial Navy to its knees.Earth would grow to become a key research world for the Galactic Empire. Their computers were integrated into the weapons of the Empire, allowing Imperial guns to target Rebel ships with pinpoint accuracy. Fighters now received flight assisting programs which boosted their capabilities immensely. After being brought up to speed with the rest of the galaxy technologically, Earth unveiled many new and exciting improvements to the Galactic Empire, the first being a brand new ship design, superior to the Star Destroyer in nearly every way. They also developed new revisions to the Imperial combat doctrine, introducing combined arms warfare, air support, superior armoured vehicles and artillery systems.With these weapons behind them, the Empire would turn the tide of the Galactic Civil War, putting the Rebels on the backfoot in nearly all naval encounters until they were little more than an annoyance on planets far in the Outer Rim.The people of Earth would colonise the rest of their solar system, and then surrounding stars until a large sector’s worth of Unknown Region space was under the Earth’s control. This shining jewel of the Empire was then designated the capital of this sector of space, an event which was met with much celebration among the supporters of the Empire. Earth would eventually grow to command immense power within the Empire, equivalent to the elite Core Worlds and second only to Coruscant itself.",1 follower,Ben Smith,1.3K,400,2M,https://www.quora.com/How-much-in-todays-money-would-it-cost-to-create-a-single-Warhammer-40k-Space-Marine
31,"“Sir”, an officer said. Thrawn turned his head towards him. So far, their sweep of unknown outer rim territories had been uneventful.

It was rare that anything was found not already known of“We’ve found a system, and it’s not on the star maps. It seems to have some sort of planet supporting life”. Thrawn only had to think for a second.“Set course”. It was curious that it had not been found so far, but he could not think of any reason why. Unless, of course, it was also being hidden. Even then, there were many patrols. It could truly be a system never before seen. They would have to be careful though. There was no way of telling what sort of defenses they had.“And try and get some art on the scanners. Send anything to my room”. Nobody protested as he head into the ship. Everyone had been with him long enough to know he always looked at the planets art before going there.“I would like to speak with a representitive for the planet.” Thrawn said. As a reply, the people explained how “Earth” was seperated into different sections called “Countries”. He had picked up as much from the artwork, but it helped to hear a different view on the matter. They seemed surprised at his proficiency in Basic, expecting a more strange tongue to be spoken to in.After some negotiations, he was permitted audience with the leader of the main sector of the planet, which they named “America”. It was a little surpising to see how civilized they were compared to many outer rim planets, though the art indicated they were also a warring species, putting him partially on guard. He could tell that telling them they were to be put under the empires rule would distress them, so he told them only part of the truth.He briefly went to the Emperor on the matter. He explained that they should be conquered slowly, as to prevent them initiating a counter attack, and losing lives. They hadn’t cracked hyperspace travel, making them a relatively easy target. The Emperor thanked Thrawn for his contribution, and explained he would take it from there. He never found out if his suggestion was followed, but found the planet secure under the Empires iron grip when he looked at the archives 5 years later.He never heard of the Earth again.",189 followers,Matthew Jiang,933,1.1K,5.1M,https://www.quora.com/How-much-in-todays-money-would-it-cost-to-create-a-single-Warhammer-40k-Space-Marine

He descended several levels to the main hangar, where he gestured for his two awaiting pilots. Climbing into his starfighter, he and his wingmen descended to the planet’s surface.“There appears to be sentient life on the planet, however primitive it may be,” the Captain said.“We will investigate this planet,” Vader growled. “Our Emperor must know about this new world. There will be plenty of natural resources to… utilize.”“During our previous engagement with the Rebel ships, my Lord, we lost almost half our complement of TIE fighters. I suggest tactical caution before engaging with any lethal force.”“Disregard any of our losses. We will conduct a full search of the planet,” Vader retorted, cutting off all communication.As they descended through the atmosphere, starfighters and transports rocking with the pressure and heat, Vader observed that the planet was unspoiled, beautiful and intricate in its diverse beauty.“Do not destroy any of the wildlife, if possible,” Vader said through the comm to his pilots. “I wish to meet any sentient, indigenous life by myself.”Landing in a parched desert reminiscent of Tatooine, Vader exited his spacecraft, boots crunching on the ground. The sand sent shivers up his spine, but he tolerated it. All in the name of exploration… and the Empire.Just over the horizon, he could see a grouping of pyramids.“I believe we have met the native species,” Vader said, taking a step forward. “It is time we brought Imperial justice to this lawless world.”","105,630 followers",Dave Consiglio,1.5K,6.8K,91.4M,https://www.quora.com/How-much-in-todays-money-would-it-cost-to-create-a-single-Warhammer-40k-Space-Marine

We've been trying-”“There will be no need for that, general, just get us back on course.” Darth Vader stared out the window at the planet now coming into view. He could feel the force calling out to him. Wispy red tendrils of the dark side were wrapped in a vice like grip around it. He heard cries of pain and torment, felt the anger and grief of a savage, warlike species, and the utter hopelessness and grim acceptance of the deaths of many.He also felt, interspersed with the pain, brief moments of joy, kindness, laughter. His thoughts rested on Padme as children played and ran circles in his mind.General Veers swallowed hard. He had narrowly escaped death and sought to put this mistake behind him as quickly as possible.

There is no known rebel activity in Unknown space, but best to investigate.The ISD finds a thriving human population, worthwhile bringing under the Empire’s dominion. Their presence is not unnoticed, and a wave of transmissions are directed towards the Star Destroyer. Meanwhile, the Star Destroyer moves into low orbit, in order to better conduct surveillance.The Imperials don’t use communications so primitive as radio, having long since moved to superluminal technology. However, their advanced sensors do detect the radio transmissions, which are quickly demodulated, as a basic frequency shifting regime.Thus, communications are opened. The Imperials are surprised that such an advanced world doesn’t have a world government, instead still being engaged in internal conflict. However, when their demand to submit to the empire is transmitted, a rather expletive-ridden response is forthcoming from all world leaders, except for Emmanuel Macron, President of France, who surrenders unconditionally….As a demonstration of power, the Star Destroyer fires a turbolaser barrage at a small, seemingly unimportant city, to the north of the planet. “Hiroshima” is leveled.This prompts a barrage of rockets launching towards the star destroyer. Initially thinking that these were the world’s respective factions sending diplomatic delegations to surrender, they are surprised when the rockets make a suicidal approach to the ship, realizing that this is some form of weapon. Although point defenses eliminate some of the incoming barrage, a wave of nuclear explosions tears across the shield - which momentarily fails.The star destroyer suffers some surface damage from the nuclear volley - but, more significantly, a devastating EMP rips through the ship’s systems. The only thing comparable to this in Imperial knowledge is an ion cannon. The turbolasers are out of commission, and the hyperdrive is heavily damaged. Impulse engines are also unusable - fortunately, as a fuel saving measure, the Star Destroyer had entered orbit, rather than using the engines to hover.With most systems heavily damaged, the Star Destroyer sends its garrison of stormtroopers to subdue the planet. TIE fighters are sent down to attain air supremacy - but Earth seems to have a capable air force. Even though they’re incapable of spaceflight, their atmospheric maneuverability means that the TIEs are initially outclassed.Very quickly, a change of strategy is pursued - the TIEs will remain in the upper stratosphere, out of range of both “jets” and their missiles. The few point defense cannons in operation on the Star Destroyer are used to support the TIEs, and slight air superiority is achieved.With the limited capability for force projection, the empire begin their attempt at conquest, while making contact with the Imperial fleet. A troop craft is sent to the city known as “London”, and are faced by the British Military. The stormtroopers are undoubtedly the superior fighting force, but the British fight them in the streets and the fields. They never surrender.This draws out the full power of the stormtrooper garrison. But, while the intense firefight is ongoing, the SAS sneak on-board the shuttle craft. With them, they have a suitcase nuclear weapon:As soon as the shuttle craft returns to the star destroyer, the activation signal is transmitted. While the outside of the star destroyer can resist a nuclear attack, the interior cannot. It blows up from the inside.A couple more days later, a large mass drops out of hyperspace. It’s no moon, it’s a space station.You may fire when readyTarkin would definitely be interested in a planet that could down an Imperial Star Destroyer, with such crude spaceflight capabilities. They might be useful. At the same time, they successfully resisted the empire, and that cannot be tolerated.So is it a statement, or a manifesto?Image attribution:Imperial Star Destroyer approaches Earth by Affet-kak on DeviantArtFile:SADM(cropped).jpg - Wikimedia CommonsStills from Rouge One / A New Hope / Empire Strikes Back",0 followers,Ben Choucroun,822,1.2K,40.6M,https://www.quora.com/How-much-in-todays-money-would-it-cost-to-create-a-single-Warhammer-40k-Space-Marine
