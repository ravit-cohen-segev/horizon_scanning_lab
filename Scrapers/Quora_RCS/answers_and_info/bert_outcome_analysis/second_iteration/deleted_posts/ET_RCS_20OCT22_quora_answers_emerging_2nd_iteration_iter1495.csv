For example:Learn something new every day.When you are intellectually curious, your brain is constantly looking for opportunities to absorb new information that goes beyond your school curriculum, job description, or any set of social responsibilities. There are many ways to feed your curiosity. Read books, both fiction and non-fiction. Use a thesaurus to broaden your vocabulary. Watch documentaries on ancient civilizations, world-class leaders, the animal kingdom, and history of humankind. Do in-depth research and read about different ways to improve the quality of your life with positive daily habits that can keep you mentally and physically healthy.Find a career path that’s a good fit for your personality, skills, and interests.That means you first need to get to know yourself as well as possible. Set aside a couple of hours this weekend — better yet, every weekend for the next three months — to write a few things down in your journal, which is always an excellent way to begin developing any big idea. Take the time to identify which personality traits you like having most, then write down the skills you can explore, improve, and master in order to take full advantage of those traits. Or, if you’d like to focus on a subject or field of expertise you want to pursue to get the job you always dreamed of, think how you can find a mentor to guide you on the path to getting there.Don’t apologize for being yourself.There will be many times in your life (going through school, working on your career, switching jobs, getting into a relationship, starting a family) when you’ll be questioned, undermined, or criticized for your behavior, personality, ideas, or achievements. In those times, it’s important to keep in mind that you are unique in your own right and you are a whole person. This means that you have a combination of DNA, intelligence, personality traits, small quirks, likes and dislikes, routines, habits, and a number of skills that differentiate you from the rest of the world. No matter what, always stand up for being your own self and don’t feel obligated to explain why you have nurtured the skills you have built over time.Challenge taking on the role that others expect of you.In most cases, expectations of male and female roles are passed on from generation to generation without a second thought, which is a great example of fixed mindset thinking. You might hear those messages coming from your parents, neighbors, relatives, extended circle of friends, partners, even society at large.Practice setting your boundaries every day.This can apply to any number of situations where people are pushy or disrespectful of your time and space. Sometimes people aren’t aware they’re imposing, and in other cases their behavior is more aggressive. It’s up to you to take a stand and express what is OK with you and what is not. For example, if a friend insists on hanging out but you want time to yourself, tell them you’re busy and have other plans. If someone asks you to do their job or finish up a task that is their responsibility, firmly say no without getting into an argument over it. This may not feel comfortable to do in the beginning, but it’s a muscle you should work out often until it starts to feel more natural. Another benefit to setting firm boundaries is that you’ll avoid being resentful of other people in the long run because you put their needs ahead of yours.Build up your emotional resilience.It’s not the easiest thing in the world to become resilient in an emotional sense, but it certainly helps to deal with negativity, obstacles, and problems you’ll face in your life. This especially applies to criticism coming from your immediate surroundings (including family and friends) to negative feedback you’ll most certainly receive at work or school. If you learn to expect criticism, it won’t faze you much when you actually do receive it. And no matter how the message is delivered, try not to always take things personally. Learn the difference between constructive criticism (when someone suggests that you do something in a different way, giving you the opportunity to approach a problem differently) and habitual negativity (when people constantly complain and criticize no matter the topic, in which case it’s best to ignore or avoid the person altogether).Take more risks.This doesn’t mean you should start doing things that are life-threatening or can negatively impact your health and well-being. It simply means it’s OK (even morale-building) to do something on a regular basis that scares you. That’s what personal growth is all about! For example, try an activity that makes you feel uncomfortable or self-conscious. Stand up to a bully. Learn to speak in front of a bigger audience. Challenge yourself to do one new thing this year, whether it’s learning to code, training for a marathon, practicing a foreign language, or starting a conversation with someone you admire for their expertise. Taking these types of risks helps us learn, through trial and error, and learning is growth.Avoid gossip and cultivate real friendships.Gossiping and engaging in superficial exchanges is time-consuming and a fake way to build your social network. Let’s be real — how many of those conversations will you remember a year from now, let alone five? Instead of spending hours on WhatsApp discussing other people, be smarter about your time. Build friendships based on common interests and intellectual pursuits. Seek things you have in common with other people. That could mean sharing a passion for historical documentaries, engaging in a conversation about world politics, going for a hike or bike ride together, reading a novel at the same time and talking about it afterwards, taking an online class to improve a skill, etc. Build the friendship over time, communicate with each other regularly, and learn to trust one another.Respect yourself.Regardless of your age, gender, nationality, and income bracket, improving the quality of your life is strongly connected to keeping up with your value system — your moral code. Respecting yourself is a pre-requisite to achieving anything of value. What does respecting yourself really mean? It can mean respecting your time (because it’s a precious commodity and should not be wasted on trivial conversations or toxic people), your efforts (energy that you put into school, work, and your personal life), the knowledge you’ve acquired over time (which is proof that you've invested in yourself), your values (the moral code that is at the core of who you are), your goals (especially the goals you’ve prioritized because they’re important to you), and everything else you’re doing to become a better version of yourself.Make independence your #1 goal.You may be a student focused on completing their education to start a career, a professional who’s acquiring skills necessary for your career, or an entrepreneur starting a side hustle to generate more income. Either way, you are setting a foundation for becoming an independent adult. Why is independence important? Because when you are independent — financially, emotionally, physically — you are able to make choices that are right for you, on your own. What kind of choices will help you feel more independent? It can be anything from deciding which food to eat to be more healthy, saving up money to move to an apartment you can afford on your own, or investing more time in personal relationships with people who pursue a growth mindset. Making these choices independently and aligning them to your own needs, values, and goals will be helpful to improve the quality of your life and your future.","72,548 followers",Nela Canovic,735,1.5K,85.6M,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-tips-and-tricks-that-will-improve-the-quality-of-my-life

That can easily be the case, as many things are not to our liking at all. In fact, we find in life that we are forced to put up with a lot of things that don’t suit us. But that is just how it is.That’s life.What could you mean by crucial factors? What are the factors, crucial or not?I can only imagine you mean the stuff of life, what makes life worth living or not. It is not easy to enumerate these factors because they are numerous and have varying effects on people.The factors that come to mind in broad terms are:FamilyJobWealthHealthI am sure you can think of others and also can divide up these crucial factors quite easily in to sub-categories. But for arguments sake, let’s take them one at time.Family:If you have a good, loving family you are lucky. It is not by design. Many families are dysfunctional, more so these days than ever before. Or so it would seem. So how are you going to avoid living in a dysfunctional family if that is the dynamics of your situation?Also, many people like me don’t have a family to speak of at all. Some people have only losses to look back on whereas many other people have scattered families geographically and rarely see their family members, even if they desire to.Job:This is perhaps one factor that is open to change, but even then you have to have the aptitude for the type of work you desire. It is not enough to say you could be good at something. You need to get out there and prove it to yourself.Jobs are fluid these days. Gone are the days when people stuck with one company for forty years. Nowadays, it is common for a person to have many different types of career. Yet, even then, with lay-offs and unforeseen circumstances (like Covid) people are forced out of the work they desire.Wealth:Oh, dear, this is a moot point. Again, it is not so much what a person desires as how likely it is for a person to achieve. To achieve great wealth you need to either inherit it, work hard for it, or get super lucky. And how many people are in control over their wealth. Far fewer than we would like to think.Again, circumstances can change our livelihood where most of our wealth comes from. We are often not in control of our situations. How many people are poor and stuck in a poverty trap? And how many other people work three jobs and find it impossible to progress in life?Health:Now there’s a non-starter. If you have good health, rejoice, get down on your knees and be thankful. Be grateful that luck has helped you through life. If you have misused your health with self-indulgence then it is often inevitable that you will become ill. But many other people are sick through no fault of their own.And, we get old and sick. It is expected. Modern medicine rarely cures anything in the West. We don’t even look to doctors for preventative care in the main. No, we are forever being treated for our symptoms and quite often the treatments fail, and we get sicker over time.So, we seem to be back to your hypothesis. What are the crucial factors for improving one’s quality of life?I would have to say self-care is the answer. If we go to bed at a reasonable time, eat good, nutritious food and exercise daily then we have more chance of a good quality life.But, you must know people who go to extraordinary lengths to care for themselves, and sadly get sick and die.Nothing is guaranteed in this world. The only thing we can do about it is to be grateful for what we have.",0 followers,Ashish Kumar,31.4K,89,674.9K,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-tips-and-tricks-that-will-improve-the-quality-of-my-life

I was a lazy fat shit. I was destroying my life, my body and had become underconfident and didn't really prefer going out of my comfort zone.At this point of time, I had started believing that this is how I'm gonna live all my life, but there was this feeling which was nagging me, the worst feeling that you can probably ever get.The feeling of self loathing.And just one random day, I thought let's give it a try. I didn't have anything to lose anyway.So I searched a bit about fat loss on the internet and made this.A little plan. Not something tough.But what was difficult was following it everyday without any excuses. I still remember a guy came into my room and laughed at this and said it's no use doing this and I'll always be like this.After a little more time, I understood that mocking and discouragement was a part of this.Managing everything was very difficult. I couldn't divide my time properly and I missed deadlines.After around 2 months, there wasn't much difference in my body but I could see that I was more attentive, more active and a little more disciplined.Then came running. Which has become my absolute favourite right now.I ran in my campus. I used to go out of breath in around 500–800 metres or so. Now I can run 10kms.Fast forward two more months.I started lifting. Ordered some dumbbell sets from Amazon. Started studying about fitness. Made notes. Started to count calories.I studied about a particular diet or a workout regime before implementing it on me.While buying stuff from market, I used to see the caloric contents rather than the price tag.And some people had started telling me that I looked a bit slim. It felt nice.I could see my muscles and biceps taking shape. It felt amazing and that I could also have a nice physique. And then I understood; that I can also look good. :pIt had become my daily routine to workout and go for a run. There was no room for junk or sugary foods. I ate vegetables, eggs, paneer and oats and had regular protein shakes.I was strong. Like really strong. I extremely rarely skipped my workout or cheated on my diet.I had that discipline and I was proud of that. And still am. It was not easy.And after all this.I became this guy.It is good to live like this. People don't understand that they are destroying their lives by drinking, smoking all that. It's not cool.What's cool is to not indulge in that useless shit and live a healthy and a thriving life.Right now I stand at 6 ft and weigh around 85 kgs.Losing more than 25 kg was probably one of the toughest things in my life. But it changed me in a way I cannot imagine.There is no trace of underconfidence or self loathing left now. I understand discipline and know how to manage my time without disturbing other things.I can talk to a stranger for an hour without feeling weird or scared. It's fun to step outside now.This was me last week getting bored.So.I think I did ok. :P",18 followers,Asim Qureshi,20.3K,996,155.5M,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-tips-and-tricks-that-will-improve-the-quality-of-my-life

There was no way that he and his little brother could build this wall. This space would be empty forever.But they got started.Each day after school they went to the bakery and worked on the wall.Each day they mixed concrete and laid bricks, one after the other.Over time, the wall got bigger.A year and half later, they laid the final brick on the wall.Will’s father came outside the bakery and the three of them stood back, looking at the completed wall.Almost as if he planned it, Will’s father turned to them and said “Now, don’t you ever tell me you can’t do something again” and walked back into the shop.Here is what Will says he learned from that experience:“I learned that you don’t set out to build a wall. You don’t start by saying ‘I’m going to build the biggest, baddest wall that’s ever been built.’ You don’t start there. You say, ‘I’m going to lay this brick as perfectly as a brick can be laid.’ If you do that every single day, soon you will have a wall.” - Will SmithYour life is the same.Don’t set out saying, “I’m going to become the greatest version of myself ever.”You don’t start there, that’s too intimidating.Have the end goal in mind, but start by saying, “Today, I’m going to lay my brick as perfectly as I can lay it.”Your bricks can be whatever aspects of your life you want to work on; your fitness, your business, your personality, your relationships, anything.Start by picking the area of your life that you most want to improve and lay your first brick.If it’s your health, go for your first run.

I did not resist his tools, instead I bore all the painful tools he used on me.My friend, there is a price to everything in life. Since you decided to give up half way, you can't blame anybody who steps on you now.Doesn't the moral of the story answer the above question? There is always a purpose for your pain, a reason for your struggles and reward for your trust. Show that trust ! on life as well as on God's timing. The greatest error and deepest pain is to mould us into a better person.The best life improvement advice what I believe is -See, life may definitely need some improvement. Nothing on this planet is permanent or constant. But please ensure that in order to improve your life you don't become that harsh on it that you spoil the beauty of the pain. I strongly believe that pain is beautiful. It just needs a pair of your optimistic goggles to ublur the scenario. Try to taste every flavour of life. Don't be monotonous.Here are some of my favourite lines..I don't have everything that I want, but I do have all I need.I woke up with some aches and pains, but I woke up.My life may not be perfect, but I AM BLESSED…Just love the life you have while you create the life of your dreamsAnd in the end.. something I really found interestingजिंदगी आईसक्रीम की तरह है।",144 followers,Shubhi Agarwal,37.5K,146,4.7M,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-tips-and-tricks-that-will-improve-the-quality-of-my-life

But I think the story is helpful.When I was near to graduating with an English Literature major and a Classics minor (which, frankly, was a minor focused on Greek and Roman lit and philosophy), I emailed my best friend (who had also been an English major, then done a master's degree in educational philosophy) in a PANIC.

I was graduating without any marketable skills if I didn't want to be a teacher! I had wasted a lot of time and money on a degree that was useless!! I am disabled, what employer will take me on with two strikes (health and a background in a soft discipline) against me??! What would happen to me??!She wrote me an email full of confidence in me and promises that we would figure it out. I was soothed, but remained quite frightened. (This is not uncommon for Millenials and generations that follow. Job insecurity is rampant. People feel this way all the time, no matter what degree they choose. Still, the fear was very real at the time. Be prepared that you may feel it, too, no matter what you choose.) It is worth noting that my best friend lives in a country where healthcare is not dependent upon landing a good job. She simply could not comprehend the urgency I felt on that score.So, I turned to my father, who is very wise and very tender. He also has always known how to speak in a way my brain will hear through my anxiety. I am INCREDIBLY lucky. I called him and expressed all my fears about what I would do and how I thought I had set myself up for failure by foolishly choosing to study what I loved, rather than something practical.My software engineer, highly-educated father then told me how jealous he was of me. Of what I knew. He told me that there would come a time when the knowledge he had accrued would simply no longer be useful. He would not be a software engineer forever. And once he was no longer working, his skills would see far less use, and be far less applicable in day to day life. He wasn't sorry for choosing to study what he loved, but he was aware that there would, eventually, come a time that it was no longer necessary or useful.He reminded me that I would never see that day. That what I learned—whether it was communication skills or writing skills or how to cogently present and defend an opinion or how to process lots of data into a conclusion or how to interpret information in myriad ways or even what I had learned about humanity through studying their art (both the fictions and truths they told in that art) —would NEVER be useless. My education would serve me in both my vocation, whatever it may be, and my life. My father told me how wonderful he thought that was. My fears didn't go away, but they quieted enough for me to see possibilities and futures that the tunnel vision of fear had obscured.When you study English, you study so much more than stories. In order to understand the symbolism, you have to study culture, law, science, philosophy, religion, history, etc. As you study these other things, even just the small slices of them that allow you to understand, you start to study new ways of thinking and perspective. This is on top of the foundation of grammar, critical thinking, analysis, and communication of ideas that is inherent to an English degree. These are VITAL skills in the workplace.So, returning to the initial question: what are the opportunities for English majors?What opportunities aren't there?Some will require more training, some you will be able to access with the skills you leave the degree with. I have been a customer service professional, where communication and grasping different perspectives is mandatory. I was into non-profit project management for a while (no business degree, but organizational, communication, and analytical skills that I had learned throughout my degree). Now I've moved to finance (still no business or finance degree, but plenty of licensing). I'm using skills I learned in my degree constantly—my dad was right, as he so often is.You will hear a lot of people tell you that an English major is a degree with limited usefulness. F*ck 'em. My fellow graduates have gone into library science, law, teaching, writing, editing, public service, and fundraising. If you really dig in, if you dedicate yourself to learning not just enough to slap together a paper that will make your teacher happy, but about everything I listed above, you will have a degree of LIMITLESS usefulness and opportunity.Good luck, denizen of the internet. I hope you find the right degree and opportunity for you.",326 followers,Anubhav Jain,653,4.4K,123.4M,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-tips-and-tricks-that-will-improve-the-quality-of-my-life

They never doubted my decisions especially my dad. I can express my views and beliefs openly and they might not agree to them but they don't stop me from anything.That's me with my parents 😊Thank you for A2A‘I can say this that my parents let me live the life I want to live.

They know my mistakes and even after that they accept me and show the right track. It's important to understand they have seen the world lot more closely as compared to us.We might take years to understand this fundamental but definitely come across the reality one day.You should have the guts to share most of the things with your parents. Whether it's a mistake or victory or wishes or desire. Anything.Also parents have to be flexible enough to hear out their kids and understand them at their level.Misunderstandings and confusion can take awhile but at the end some outcome would be great to hear from home people.But But But….there must be a line or some boundary between what you're sharing and what's worth sharing with them. You can't be all Frank with your parents.There is a word decency served very badly by kids nowadays. They have forgotten the manners and etiquette to behave and understand things.You must be sure enough what to share. You should be willing to accept your parents decision and suggestions.All this is very important part. Being open minded is not that easy specially in a country like India with lot of challenges and involvement of society.Then there is co-ordination between kids and parents. Albeit all the facts and happenings we are a one big happy family.Evolve in relationship with your parents. Learn more from them. Make them aware about the world.

Few we dictate to the children.few we follow as an order from our elders.About finances…that is confidential matter to anyone.Okay! I would tell about my family in detail.My grandmother was very modern in thinking. Lived very orthodox.My grandfather was very shrewd and intelligent with accounts.I don't have paternal grandparents.My Mil thinks very rational and she is up to date about many things. Sometimes thinks very orthodox too. Lives according to the time and situation.My mom! she thinks, lives, every thing neither like an orthodox nor modern. She belongs to an elite class. She prefers only royal life.My dad was a store of knowledge about all epics and an experienced and expert in civil engineering. Personification of sincerity, honesty. He was very angry but soft hearted.My Fil was personification of all good things. But rarely expressed his opinion.Now.. my family..I learnt a lot from all of them. My husband always would explain everything like a school teacher. Takes a big class that explains plus and minus points of any issue.I am like…. ‘why can't you tell straight away to our son what he has to do ?…type thinking one.My husband smiles beautifully.ohhh! I would lose my heart to him hundred times a day!! (Come on Rama! You are not a new bride!!)He says ‘opinions tend to change. I should give the information to him. Not a decision. My opinion of today may not be there tomorrow. It may change. So I shouldn't influence his thought process with my ideology.Our son should decide what he has to do. In epicAnother thing! only till a particular age we should tell what to do. Not after that. Later we should encourage them to think on their own. Let him take his own decisions'. My husband concludes.Honestly speaking I don't have that much patience. I ask him ‘what is this right place? Children are always busy!‘It should be at right place also!’ My husband repeated again looking sharply. As if I am a third standard student.‘Bhagavad Geeta'That is the reason I call my husband krishna paramatma!! Haha.Myself…I hate hundreds of things and I love hundreds of things too. But when the time comes to explain to my son and Dil I would have no preconceived opinions. I hide my likes and dislikes, portrait only the reality. The Truth. Because I may change my opinions with my age. But my wrong seeding in their minds push them in to more confusion and more problems . They would end up finally neither this side, nor that side.So I explain them what are the accepted norms in the society so far . What are the experiments done by few people to deviate from established systems. The failures and success results of them. Then I would leave them to decide.A huge debate we would have. I accept sometimes my opinions are outdated. They accept sometimes my ideas are really apt for the situations.Risk taking.. me and my son would be one party. We love to take little risks.New technology and facilities are adopted easily by my husband and my dil . They are a bit conservative regarding risks.Open-minded to listen anything without biased judgement is the norm of our house. Later we decide what to do. Some times we fail. Sometimes we win. Sometimes we go wrong. Sometimes we go right.But… but..We are not hundred percent perfect.Some times we think we are open minded. But don't realise we are going biased and rigid . Then our kids make us understand where we were going wrong. They put really great effort to make us see their point of view.My husband and me sulk sometimes. After all there is generation gap! Haha.we do take some time to think. Infact considering their age and position and financial stability, our children are no where depending on us. Still waiting for our acceptance. Trying to convince us.. what a nice culture they got!So me and my husband would realise , we too should show some maturity. Should understand their point of view too. Atleast should try..Then we too would come down from our pedestals and agree with the children.So finally this is our family Though all of us are different.Same thing is with my parents and my husband's parents too.",326 followers,Anubhav Jain,1.8K,4.4K,123.4M,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-tips-and-tricks-that-will-improve-the-quality-of-my-life

43,"Well, It’s going to be a very long one (trust me, probably the longest you've ever read on this topic. 2017 se 2021 ki kahaani hai, 11th se 3rd drop), so please bear with me.Well, It’s going to be a very long one (trust me, probably the longest you've ever read on this topic. 2017 se 2021 ki kahaani hai, 11th se 3rd drop), so please bear with me.Let's begin.I was an above-average student in school, till class 10. I scored 9.8 CGPA. I was quite weak in maths, and this was the reason for scoring 9.8 CGPA, not 10.Bhai mere 51 marks aaye the maths me half-yearly me out of 90, ye koi baat hai karne ki.😂😂Then for the very same reason samjh gaye…JEE isn't for me. Plus, I had an interest in biology. So NEET it is.In class 11th (2017), I took admission in Allen KOTA. I studied and studied and studied..I didn't understand why, but my marks never went beyond 400. Maybe because I didn't know ki padhna kaise hai, or maybe because the teachers that taught my batch in class 11th generally focused only on mugging things up (12th and further we had great teachers)Still, I had a zeal..that I HAVE TO DO THIS.I had one friend at this stage, Prabhat. He too faced the exact same problem. Maybe that’s the reason why we have a great friendship! He’s the only friend I made in Kota who is still in my life till date! He cleared NEET in 2020 (currently in GMC Basti) with marks around 609 and AIR around 16000. And of course, he’s a great hooman, exactly the kind which one needs!11th class ended. I knew ki12th class started. But something was missing this year after the initial 2–3 months. My zeal somehow vanished. I couldn't focus in class, felt sleepy…like every second. Recalling those days, I now realize what my mistake was. After these initial 2–3 months…I should have asked for help. But I thought ki *you are the one jisko padhna hai…so..koi help nahi karega.. tumhe hi padhna hai* (at the end, you are the one who has to study). Initially, I used to prepare a lottt for minor exams(topic wise test) of Allen. But after these 4–5 months, bass muh utha ke exam dete the, without preparation, and would score 35–40% marks, i.e 250–300 marks.This was my biggest mistake in the preparation phase.Lesson 1:Then, near about February 20, our course was completed in class. Then the only thing that struck me was, my 12th boards were after 10 days and I knew absolutely nothing! Aisa nahi tha ki padhte nahi the, padhte the, but marks me convert nahi kar pate the.For the next 10 days, I studied like hell but could complete only English, as English was my first board exam, and I have never touched the book. After a day’s gap, was my Physics exam. With only one day to prepare, I started with my Allen notes in the morning and continued non-stop till evening,7 pm to be precise. I had completed only 2 topics by now, Electrostatics and Current electricity. Then I went for dinner, took a break, and returned till 9. Then after the ‘routine call’ to my parents, I started again with physics. I started studying with Allen's notes but it was taking forever to complete. So around 2 A.M. I took the “Exam Idea"" book and a bottle of Coke (20 Rs), started learning every fact, every formula present in that book. Surprisingly, I completed the book by 7 am. My school bus was supposed to be at my door around 8 am. So after getting ready, I left for the exam.Surprisingly enough, I did far better in the exam than I could have ever imagined. I followed the same routine for the next 5 papers. I gained confidence, ki agar try karu then I can complete some of the portions before NEET exam. Although, whatever I studied for boards, I didn't remember a word after 2 days of the exam. Highly volatile were those nights.😂Lesson 2So nothing magical happened on “The Day”. I scored around 270 marks inLesson 3Well, seeing my capability of grinding day and night during Boards, I felt it in my bones ki I can crack NEET. So I took a drop, prepared again from Allen, forI knew that I had zero understanding of anything and I had to complete the entire 2-year syllabus in 1 year from scratch. So basically, 11th and 12th was a complete waste for me.This year, I made a really good friend in class Anubhav Dhadhor (cleared NEET in 2020, AIR 12000 currently in GMC, Ayodhya). He helped me a lot in my studies, especially in Physics. This year I actually understood ki padhna kaise hai subjects ko! (How should I study).The beginning of the year was okayish, I studied for the minors and was scoring around 500–520s in Minors (bass 30–40 marks increase karne the uss time ke according)….but as we came to the end of the year i.e. around December, my marks started decreasing. I started scoring around 450–470. Around feb, I realized the mistake was not revising the past taught topics. I fell ill too this year, lost many days to that.Anyways, “the day” arrived. Scored 476 inI too gave Gorakhpur university entrance exam, for B.Sc. Bio, rank was 18. (gave me a little confidence for a drop)Lesson 4: Kids,Now, drop-2. Preparing forThis year, I knew exactly what I have to do, and also what wasn’t supposed to be done, things I have to avoid.I fell in love with PHYSICS this year. Since I sort of remembered many formulas during the previous year of preparation, this year I developed a greater understanding and paid emphasis on having a mental image of every topic. I literally had an image in my head every time I did a question.I scored around 550–560 in Minors. Chemistry was still average and this was only thing that was pulling me back (was scoring 120–130/180). In Feb 2020, our Majors started. I scored 580–590 in the first 3 majors. My confidence increased several folds (life me pahli baar 600 marks ke itne karib tha). This was just the beginning of the part syllabus, and I was getting a good grip on all subjects. The only thing that I had to do now, was to stay consistent.But, but, but, a massive but, then came March 2020, beginning of LOCKDOWN due to covid, THE FIRST WAVE.I left Kota on 25/26th march. (don’t remember the exact date) Came back to my hometown, GORAKHPUR, UP.I was finding it way too hard to study at home. Couldn’t concentrate for long, couldn’t sit for long durations.I now had something that I didn’t have in Kota, and that is Mummy ka smartphone, LAPTOP, and Internet, aree nahi nahi, but UNLIMITED INTERNET!I started watching a web series. What started as “only post-dinner break”, became a routine, and then little did I know that I would binge-watch it! “How I Met Your Mother” was one hell of an interesting show. Poor TED MOSBY.Lesson 5Lesson 6Dekhte hi dekhte August aa gaya, exams were near, and I was scared as hell because I literally had left touching the books between June-July.I gave a full syllabus exam at the beginning of August. I scored 420 marks, which felt like a tight slap on my cheeks. I was in shock, couldn’t believe what I was seeing. It was my mistake this time. Hey bhagwaan, khud ke pairo pe kulhaadi maari thi maine, apni barbaadi ka mai khud zimedaar hu.I called Akash Bhagra Sir, my chemistry teacher in ALLEN. Told everything to him, told him all the things that I had done. He explained to me what to do next and what my plan should be. I had only 15–20 days in hand, I followed it, improved my schedule, and my marks gradually increased but it wasn’t much.Arrived “the day”,Marks to increase hue last year se, but AIR bekaar hua.I committed a mistake this year during the exam. I completed my paper in just 2 hours 25 mins including OMR. I filled OMR along with each completing section. So I still had around half-hour but my OMR was filled so I couldn’t do anything, except for staring at the paper.After the result was published, my brother asked me just one question- “Do you know what went wrong this year?”… I answered “yes”. He didn’t ask anything else.Boy, did I cry that night! Only my pillow could tell. I exactly knew what went wrong and when things went off-road. Remembering my 580–590 marks of Feb-march, I knew I had everything in my reach, but it was me who had distorted everything. Drop lene k himmat nahi thi, but my family persuaded me to take a drop kyuki 6 mahine ki baat thi, (it was a matter of 6 months). Since the result came out in October and the tentative schedule for NEET 2021 was MAY. That 580–590 marks of March kept screaming to me in my head ki you would regret not taking a drop, as you are very close to a government college. I decided to take a drop. But this would be the final. No more attempts. This would be my last chance to prove myself!Lesson 7: Kids, there will be moments in life when you’ll know what you did was wrong and it was solely your fault. For those moments,I started my preparation for10–15 days changed into 1.5 months but they still had things online, whereas every other coaching in the city had even started taking tests offline. Even Allen had its classes offline by now. But by now I realized, that I was killing my time in coaching. There was nothing new that they would teach me, and also as I have studied from Allen “Kota”, the best possible, the teaching at Gorakhpur centers were “not that good nor engaging”. It was simply a waste of time for me, except for the “two good” teachers there.I left taking classes but gave all Aakash tests. In minors, I scored 600–630 marks.(Highest 670) But since I was all alone in one room, all day long for 4–5 months…I never felt a single ounce of confidence although my marks were 600+ (some days were bad too when marks went below 600). Kuye ka medhak ban gaye the!(felt like a frog in a well). The worst thing above all, classes did start offline but all minor and major exams were conducted online, which I feel was useless.Lesson 8The ‘only good thing’ or “benefit” of joining Aakash that I felt was the test series at the endThere was one thing that I pledged this year, and that was, I wouldn’t touch the OMR until it was the last 20 minutes of paper, as I’d done this mistake in NEET 2020I had solved a total of 61 test papers in the last 40 days (55 coaching papers, allen & aakash combined, and 6 past year papers) and near aboutI had a different approach in solving the OMR. I would solve the paper completely and then section-wise, I would put a DOT on responses which I had to darken. In such a way, if I made a mistake, then only a dot would be there on OMR, not a dark bubble as that would be game over. So, after putting a DOT on every answer on OMR, I would bubble all OMRs in one go. This took me about 10–12 minutes in total.Then came “The day”. 12th September 2021.My father asked me right outside the gate of the exam center, what my strategy of solving paper was. I told him the sequence, bio, chem, and physics. He asked me how I filled the OMR. I told him what I wrote above. He told me not to do that, rather I should fill OMR after completing a subject. I told him that I’ve made this mistake last year and I’m not going to repeat that mistake.Anyways, I entered the exam room at around 1:35. Was getting comfortable, everything was good. The clock showed 1:55. We asked them to give the paper so that we could fill Name etc on OMR, as in previous years we were given paper 10–15 min prior to the exam starting time. Bell rang at 1:55, But these dipshit invigilators gave paper at 2:00. Khud ko samjhaye, it’s fine..don’t panic. And then everything happened at once, filling OMR, signature on the Attendance sheet, signature on OMR, cross-checking of OMR sheet, it took 15 mins.I started solving, Biology was going smooth AF. Completed biology till 2:40. Took around 25 min, which was good according to all the mock tests. Started with Chemistry, felt the paper is good(my chemistry was average, especially inorganic), solved 2–3 questions, but what my father said bugged me continuously, so I came back to OMR and I filled Botany with extreme cautiousness as I never filled OMR this way, this wasn’t my game-plan. It took me nearly 5 mins to complete the Botany section OMR and in the Zoology section, I had put dots on my responses by didn’t darken it, thinking I have plenty of time right now, and my subconscious told me not to try anything new. So, I came back to solving chemistry with only my Botany OMR filled.Solved Chemistry till 3:30. Felt like losing confidence but then, it was time for my favorite subject now, physics.When I started solving physics, I felt that the paper was really good. Those who have “really studied” the topic, only they would be able to solve the paper. But aaj pata nahi physics ko mere saath kya problem thi, I had to solve a few questions twice sometimes to get the answer. Once I finished “round-1” of physics, I saw the clock, it was 4:45. Now, I thought, what is done is done, fill OMR now. I completed putting dots on all questions of physics and chemistry. Saw the clock, it was 4:51. All I had to do now was bubble those dots in one go of physics, chemistry, and zoology. Just 135 OMR to bubble in one go in 9 mins, enough, right?.Started filling physics, went onto chemistry, and was at section B, and the last 3 questions were left.BUT, the invigilator started collecting OMRs!!! Nobody protested that there’s 5 min left. 12 students in class and not one of them raised their voice. These idiots were sitting ideally. When the invigilator came to me, I was at question 30th of zoology, i.e at question number 165, 15 question to bubble. I pleaded, I begged, I kept on screaming, sir there’s 5 minutes left, it’s a matter of my whole life, my entire hard work of 4 years would go down the gutter, please give me just one minute, but they didn’t listen.There were 2 invigilators in class, the sir who came to collect my OMR, held my right hand with which I was filling the OMR so that I couldn’t fill anymore now. The ma’am there, called security. 1 teacher and 2 people came who were just outside my class came in, this happened in a matter of seconds. They all started manhandling me,I knew it has been messed up, everything is over now.Came out of the center, my brother and Aakash faculty were there, waiting.Words weren’t coming out of my mouth, I was about to explode in tears, but I couldn’t. I felt my heart pumping very fast. I didn’t know what was happening, didn’t know if this really had happened. Teachers came to me, asked how my paper went. I told them everything, my brother was there too. One of the teachers saw my wrist, it was bleeding, probably due to the forceful snatching. They said “Stay calm Sudhanshu, what is done is done, it’s fine, the paper was tough, cutoff would be around 570–580, and seeing my physics they said you really have done well. First, go and get a Tetanus shot and go home for now.”I got a tetanus shot and returned home around 6:45. Told my parents everything. Papa said, bola that pahle bharne ko but tumhe to apne mann ki karni hoti hai, jaate jaate bola that ki pahle OMR bhar lena, lekin nahi, 4th time exam de raha aur OMR galat karke aaya hai.(I told you to fill the OMR first, 4th time you are giving the same exam and you still did a rookie mistake). Later on he said, bewakoof bana raha hai ye sabko, they didn’t believe that I have even put dots on OMR or anything of this sort had happened. It all felt spooky to them, the only explanation they could think of at that moment was that he has left 10 questions and he is blaming the invigilators.Allen’s answer key came around 8 PM on the same day. I only know, ki ye 1–1.5 ghante kaise beete the.Started matching my answers with the answer key. Every wrong question felt like a hard-hitting punch (I calculated, let’s assume I have left all 10 questions of section B, so I would be scoring 628–40=Now recalling what my teachers have said about cutoff, and all speculations of 590 being All India cutoff, I felt ki 588 pe, I’ll get a college from home state quota. Not a good college, but a newly opened college. But I thanked God, ki something is better than nothing. Jahan government nahi mil raha that, ab toh hope dikh rahi so it’s fine.But reading some answers on Quora, and seeing some videos on youtube, there were people who were saying that All India’s cutoff would be around 600. I felt my chances decreasing.I thought to act on this before it’s too late.ILesson 9Was I using this method for the first time? No, I’ve used it for the last 2 years.Was it my fault that the classroom watch was 5 minutes slow? No, it wasn’t.Does all this make any link with ‘luck’? Maybe, maybe not.The thing is, what happened that day was beyond my control. All you and I could do is study and practice and give our very best. Did I not do that? Yes, I DID.So, when I say, everything is not going to happen as you plan, I mean it. Your “plans” would laugh at your face if they aren’t backed up with proper hard work. So when you know that working hard is something that you can do and you should do, what are you waiting for?Anyways, OMR was shown online, I was relieved to see, only 7 questions were left in zoology, but I filled 3 OMR wrong in panic. And the machine hadn’t detected the last 7 questions. But to my surprise, the machine did read question 99 which had even a lighter dot than the ending ones. God only knows how the machine works!I calculated my marks, it wasPhysics- 125 (left 5, wrong 7) (sirf round 1 hi kar paya…4 questions aate the..lekin it was taking time to solve, So I skipped it for round —2, but that never happened, and all those stupid silly mistakes)Chemistry —143( left 3, wrong 5)Biology—317 (Left 7, wrong 3. All 7 question where ending ones, which were all correct. I could have scored 345.)It was a moderate~tough paper overall (keeping in mind an average student like me). Bio was super easy, chemistry was a little above average and physics was good, conceptual.Lesson 10You all have just ONE job, and that is, to give your best. Rest is beyond your control. So, do that ONE job. Stop procrastinating things. It’s your future. It’s your dream. It’s something that you know is worth fighting for. Don’t waste your opportunity.Coming back to me, what are my plans now?Well, I know it in my bones that I had given my very best this time, and I don’t have any regrets. Jitna hum kar sakte the, hum kiye. It sometimes feels that I’m not destined to study from a government college. But the thing is that I have always dreamed about being a Doctor for the past 6–7 years. I know, the person who’s going to a government college this year is no different than me. Jab mere mahnat me kami nahi rahi, so why should there be a difference in his and my mindset.(when we both did the same hard work, why should there be a difference in mindset). Also, every time, I had some reasons and regions where I lacked. But ab isse jyaada nahi ho sakta mujhse.Good thing is, my brother is earning and if my brother and father would contribute, they can pay the fees for a private college. If it were only up to my father, this could have not been possible. I’m grateful to my family that after spending around 7–8 lakhs on me from 11th till now, they still are ready to pay for my education. If it weren’t for them, I would have done B.Sc.Speaking of B.Sc., I gave 2 additional exams this year apart from NEET. ICAR, for B.Sc. Agriculture, had AIR 908 and in BHU, B.Sc, had AIR 50.So, let’s see, what the future holds for me. Spending 60–70 lakhs on a dream, is that right, will it be fruitful? Well, we’ll find out in 5.5 years.Let’s see what happens. If anyone reading this can help me out with the college doubts, it would be of great help (specifically speaking I’m asking what I’ve written above is right or not, Will I not get Karnataka state domicile if I study MBBS from Manipal?)Do message me if you have any queries regarding Neet or anything in general. And please upvote the answer if you felt that this was worth your time and please share this with people, you think, might be benefited from this.Happy reading!🙃Edit 1:",341 followers,Sudhanshu Shekhar,1.1K,0,0,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-tips-and-tricks-that-will-improve-the-quality-of-my-life

I actually did no preparations in school days and was sure to take a drop. Following boards I went to Kota and started my NEET preparations with Allen. I stayed there for almost an year. It was my first time being away from home. Too many ups and downs in this one year duration but looking back I just remember only the good stuffs.Went there alone, ended up with a lot of friends.Got admissioned in Allen's leaderHere it is. Come along and get a sneak peak of this beautiful journey. Not much about academics ,but tons of wonderful memories.My NEET journey started in 2019 after class 12. I actually did no preparations in school days and was sure to take a drop. Following boards I went to Kota and started my NEET preparations with Allen. I stayed there for almost an year. It was my first time being away from home. Too many ups and downs in this one year duration but looking back I just remember only the good stuffs.Went there alone, ended up with a lot of friends.Got admissioned in Allen's leader batch and after orientation session regular classes started.Classes were large Hall like with strength of around 220 students. For the first few weeks, I was busy figuring out a perfect seating location. The teachers understood our conditions and were very friendly. It took me about a month to adapt to the spiciness and other odd flavours of food mess . Really, I suffered a lot initially.On of my school friends (sumit) who took admission in same building lived there in a different hostel. Sometimes we met in (so called)park after dinner and discussed about everything happened.There he is.Another school friend,I sometimes wondered what my position would be in these 1500 competitors. Anyways, First Minor paper was conducted and everyone was very excited (sort of😁).The results were declared and I got overall 4th rank. (1st in my class)By the end of this month, I had established myself on the first right seat ,almost adapted to mess's food but another trouble started. You may find it funny but I was very much depressed with hairfall and dandruff. It's common for majority of boys in kota. It was really painful to see those hairs falling off my head.(RIP)We are taught in schools that Rajasthan is a land of deserts with scanty rainfall, right? but it rained a hell lot last a year. Sometimes we had to walk in ankle deep water.I used to eat sprouted gram seeds and one day I thought of raising it to see how far it can go.It survived for about 30 days. It died probably due to lack of nutrition coz I gave it just water, nothing else ( Oh God please forgive me.)Rain againFirst AIIMS mock test was made, I got 5th rank2nd Sept- It's Ganesh Chaturthi.That's Dr Ganesha of Landmark City.10th Sept- One of my most awaited days of the session. It was the time of medal distribution. I got my 3 medals on stage in front of more than 2500 students. It was a very proud moment for me. Shall never forget it.In the next Minor I got 3rd rank.Parents came to meet. My mother brought a lot of snacks ( laddu, namkeen, gujjia etc). Their arrival proved lucky for me as I got first rank in any exam for the first time including school days. It was in this second AIIMS mock test.Soon after this test, rumors of main AIIMS exams getting merged into NEET started.One of our chemistry techers( Ankit singhal sir) beautifully narrated “Chichore“ movie's summary.Hey reader, you still there. Have some Allen Prasadam on the eve of Diwali. Very tasty 😋Classes start vacating and students started leaving even before the one week Diwali holidays. Rituraj and I decided to stay back. Taking advantage of semi-empty classes I fulfilled my desire of attending the lectures seated at the back.Just before Diwali holidays I got selected in the SRG batch.SRG was no fun. We had extra tests with high level question. With NEET's point of view those hard questions often seemed a waste of time. There was a lot of pressure and time scarcity after this new previlage. There are rumors that SRG students get a monthly allowance, but it's nothing as such. There is a scholarship program (AASP) and anybody can win based on his mark and rank in minors.23rd Oct- It's Diwali. This is Samyak.26 oct-Red Auroras in Kota 🤩Soon after the Diwali holidays, there was surprise semi-major exam in which I got First rank. So yeah, my holiday sacrifice paid off.14 Nov- it's Children's day but wait, we are not Kids anymore. We are all grown ups who need some manners so here is SANSKAR MAHOTSAV.It was a new and soulful experience. Never before thought that Bhajan-Kirtans can be so beautiful.We had NEET info and courier councilling session in which we were informed about various courses (MBBS , BDS ,BAMS etc) and medical colleges. AIIMS and jipmer exams finally merged into NEET .NEET-ug registrations started. Syllabus and schedules of major tests were put on the notice boards.I was happy as my hair got adapted to Kota's weather and water , hair fall stopped. Mess's food quality, (especially breakfast) worsened. Kachori😍 and poha proved to be a good alternative.31st Dec- Said goodbye to this fantastic year with a tea-pasta party at hostel's top.1st jan- Another medal giveaway session. This time I got 6 of them🤩. A perfect way to start year.Kota on Sundays witnesses a flood of folks walking down the streets, street lights sparkle and you get to see a lot of Love birds. But you realize that you are just a loner and move on. At this point while I'm writing down this point , I can't help but think of her ;Anyways, back to answer.Teachers got a deadline to finish the syllabus by 7feb. We literally had 5 physics teachers teaching at the same time to speed up the syllabus. They even started taking extra classes in the morning.Somehow the syllabus finished in the first week of Feb. Major tests started on 11th. Now we had a major paper every 3 days. Although there were no regular classes, we still had some optional revision classes.Oh, I forgot I was in SRG. So now my regular SRG classes started to cover up whole NCERT chemistry so as to tackle any unorthodox question.Meanwhile, my father revisited. This time we planned for a trip to Chambal Garden. Shivansh joined us to complete the school time trio.Rituraj-left. Shivansh-rightRitu with “Stepmom” above😁Very next day I had a test for which I was obviously not prepared but surprisingly everything went right and I got 360/360 in bio for the first time.10 March- Happy Holi.Those are achiever fellas playing Holi and hanging on wires are their previous year Allen t-shirtsOur mess used to provide the below dinner combo once/twice a month. It was one of the few most loved meals.26th March- Remember something?? Well, this was the day Modi Ji enforced the first 21 days Nationwide lockdown. Without any further delay Allen closed. No more regular classroom tests and classes. All classroom students were given free subscription of mock test papers on Allen's testMyPrep app.You might remember how strictly first lockdown was imposed. Police kept patrolling to check any free roamers. The nearby grocery shop illegally raised the prices of food items. I still remember buying yippee noodles at 12 instead of 10. It was funny to see how some guys ran like refugees to get food supplies whenever the shop opened. The price of masks skyrocketed. Mess's food quality dropped even further. Just think of the situation of students with Nokia 3310 in this scenario. We were helpless.Nostalgia started taking over my once very determined mind. My parents decided to come and receive me just after this lockdown. I knew in my mind that NEET would be postponed for sure so naturally I started losing enthusiasm in studies. Now all I wanted was to go back home somehow.Finally the 21 days lockdown ended, but wait , Modi ji got no chills. he is like,He started another 10 days lockdown. I started losing my mind. I was so angry that day that I bought a lot of snacks and watched movies that entire day. (What else could I do,😑).16 April- A message from Allen popped up on my screen. It said that UP government had sent busses to take us back home. I cannot verbally explain my feelings at that moment (17 April- Busses arrived that night but my trip was scheduled for next day. Only 2 baggages were allowed per person ( although I bought4😤). Many of the desperate students overestimated the pandemic and didn't take thier notes &books. I personally didn't had much belongings and efficiently packed everything. (THANKS BUNTY B😁) .18 April-. All the students were thermally screened and two busses set for basti from Land mark city. Finally we were heading back home.In the room waiting for theremal screeningSocial distancing inside bus🤣That's our luggage respectfully stacked at the backWe reached Agra at night. After thermal screening we were given Puri-Sabji . That night again, I didn't sleep. I was busy enjoying the beautiful journey.19 April- After about a day's journey we finally reached pachwas, (a place near Basti).Luckily, everyone was negative and by evening we all were dispersed back to our homes.On Bus station waiting for someone to receive usEnjoying “Ghar ki chai -pakori” after one yearAll in all, this was a very dramatic and thrilling month. It is among some of the rare extreme experiences I have in my memory .NEET paper was further postponed to 26 July. I was still unable to concentrate on my studies, so took a month break and relaxed. (Resumed my studies with full vigour. By the end of June I had revised complete syllabus.I missed thoseI started solving previous year AIIMS papers. (Neet was postponed to 13 September. Nevermind, I tried to maintain my usual pace.Started solving NTA test abhyas papers(13 Sept- Finally,Me on NEET morningWell, the paper was very easy. I was expecting to score 680+ but after matching with Allen's answer key I had only 650 marks. Nevertheless, I was relieved.Results were out and I got 654 marks , 4 more than I expected...So after 4 days of writing and a lot of procrastination, finally we are at the end of this tale.Thank you dear reader😊You can appreciate my effort by upvoting and commenting..✌️Peace✌️",0 followers,Mahadev Verma,2.5K,0,0,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-tips-and-tricks-that-will-improve-the-quality-of-my-life

Find me if you can)I had no knowledge whatsoever about the medical entrance exam when I passed out. I didn’t gave NEET 2017 for this very reason.Year 2018Year 2019I was a little depressed deep down. I was thinking of what to do next. I already had been beaten down twice I wasn’t thinking of any other drop year. Relatives were just advising my parents to get me into some ug course. This would’ve happened with each and every one us who have dropped a year. I was literally going to take the easy path and just give up.But then I remembered why I startedMy parents didn’t care what others were saying they were happy with whatever I wanted to do. I thought to myself if my parents are not willing to give up on me why should I give up on myself. Something changed in me that day. And then came the payback time.Year 2020To summarise I did the followingI used to get tantrums from relatives that I am wasting time and money of my parents. What kept me going was my willingness for the goal. I did felt demotivated at times which am sure you all reading this answer will feel at some point of time in your preparation but that is exactly when you have to show to the universe “how bad you want it”.I used to listen to motivational songsThis being my favourite video song of all time.My phone was filled with motivational quotes. Some of my favourite one’s that I saw almost daily were 👇Ps: Last one is my favouriteThen came the day and my exam just went great and I finally scored 627 with AIR 9454 in NEET 2020. I still remember the adrenaline rush I got seeing my father’s face when He saw my result. I was the happiest, my father was just boasting my result to the relatives and just shutting their mouth. I thought that was the happiest day of my life but least I knew that God had other plans too.AFMC cut off for boys came(618 in 2020) and I cleared it. I started preparing for the TOELR and for the interview. It was a dream college and I literally had zero hopes for getting it.Image source: My phone’s gallery (This was the day I came for the interview and the screening test in Pune)Finally the merit list was put on the AFMC site and I was on the waiting list(BW-08)I reported to the college on 23rd November and my waiting got cleared. I couldn’t describe that feeling into words. My parents were so proud, my sisters were so happy and finally that prooved to be the happiest day of my life.So at the end of the long journey. HERE I AM (smiling in that uniform 😉)If you’ve made till here, and if you feel a little motivated to go back and smash another previous year question paper or just smash another MCAPs(Aakash reference 😋) then My reason to pen all this down stands fulfilled.Moral of the story:Thank you for readingAll the bestJai hind 🇮🇳",210 followers,Vibhanshu Singh,1.3K,0,0,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-tips-and-tricks-that-will-improve-the-quality-of-my-life

Most of the answers to this question has a lot of success stories but today you'll learn the journey of a failure (not in life, mind you ; only in NEET)So, after class 10, I knew I loved biology more, so I took the Bio science stream. To be honest, being a doctor was not exactly a dream for me but still I would say I liked the profession quite a lot.First of all, I come from a very middle class family where I had seen my family struggling for money. I had determined that in life,My parents were overwhelmed by my decision and they supported me throughout. My father got me admitted to Aakash which took 1.5 lakh rupees. I heard it's the best offline institute in Kolkata for NEET, so I went for it. I was very serious at first, attended all classes but somehow I saw that I couldn't understand anything from the Physics teacher there. I was facing a lot of problems in Physics, so my Unit Test marks were coming low. Although it's not like that I scored amazing in Bio & Chem but still they are more or less above average.I was having problem coping up with NCERT syllabus and my school's ICSE syllabus so I said the problem to my father. He readily agreed to even change my school if I want.Anyways, fast forward to class 12 i.e the great year 2020. Out of nowhere came a virus which became a worldwide pandemic and boom, there’s the lockdown. I realized if I studied from Aakash in zoom classes it would be a loss of money as there were good online coaching institute at that time which were better. Also the money would be very high and I left Aakash before starting a class, I would get 25k rupees refund. So, I talked with my parents and decided to discontinue. I got back my refund. I decided to prepare from YouTube from Unacademy & Physics Wallah.I didn’t had a good personal smartphone until then, so my father even bought me that. So, I used to study from very good teachers and was understanding well. Unfortunately, my father was jobless for 3 months because of the lockdown. But then he joined a new company as soon as the situation was a bit better. We faced a lot of problems during those three months, I won’t be able to share those here for personal reasons. But slowly, my mindset for earning a a lot of money grew stronger and I kept studying.However, with phone comes a lot of distractions. I was fully active on Quora and wrote lot of answers. I even started a Discord server for Quora users and wasted literally a lot of time on that. Believe me,In NEET 2021, I failed badly. I already wrote 2–3 answers about it. But to be honest, I never gave my best. My parents were sad, I was too. But anyways, I decided to take a drop because I knew that if I tried hard enough, I can surely do well this time. My father at first was against taking drop but then after a lot of requests and understanding, he finally agreed. In my mind, I was determined that I won’t let my father waste so much of money on me this time, so I took the Yakeen Batch of Physics Wallah for 4000 rupees. Physics Wallah teachers were really one of the best I had ever seen, so I joined them. And this time, I knew my mistakes and was fully ready to give my all.I deleted my WhatsApp, detached from most of my friends (except those who were too close to me and were preparing with me), I stopped writing answers on Quora and I stopped using Instagram (except for some football news once in a day). I downloaded an app to lock all distracting apps while I was studying.Here’s my routine for those 6–7 months:6:30–9:30 am —— Biology self study + DPP10:15–1:00 pm —— Physics Class & Chemistry Class2:15–4:00 pm —— Biology Class4:15–5:00 pm —— Physics self study5:00–6:15 pm —— Went out to play Football/Leisure time6:30–8:30 pm —— Phyics self study + DPP8:45–10:30 pm —— Chemistry Self Study + DPP11:30 pm —— Go to sleepI followed this routine very strictly. I had completed all of the regular DPPs and gave all of the weekly test without missing a single one of them. Although I used to score inconsistently, sometimes in 400 or 450 range and sometimes above 500. I even had a diary where I wrote the marks as well as my mistakes. In short, this time I really gave my best.Near NEET 2022 exam, I enrolled myself into Allen Offline Test series. That’s where I understood my reality.“Life is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you gonna getSo, I still kept going and studied for the main exam.On July 14th, I was caught up in a viral fever. I couldn’t move my body and was having a lot of problems. I cursed my bad luck. Why this happens with me? I couldn’t study properly till 15th night. Anyways, I revised whatever was important on 16th, although I was not fully confident if I can really crack NEET this year.Finally the day arrived. I reached the center on time yesterday. As soon as I saw the Bio question, I was likeOverall, it was not good, so maybe I have failed again. I didn’t dare to check as I am too scared. I will check after some days though. Maybe I can get above 450 but won’t cross 500 most probably. So, yes, another year gone withI won’t be taking any more drops as I said I am not obsessed with NEET, rather I gave the exam because I always want to give tough things competing among the best. I will be giving other exams like CUET & ICAR. Let’s see what happens. Any suggestions will be welcomed in the comments.I learnt a lot of things in this journey which I know will give me an edge in life in future :Yes, the net result might be zero and nobody sees or cares about the above things but you yourself have to. Those people won’t feed you, you have to do something great in life for yourself and the above things is needed for that.So, what did you learn about my journey?I know some will be saying don’t be sad, it’s okay, everything will be alright. I’m sorry but I believe crying and being sad is important if you fail for a goal you were seriously working on. But yes, don’t hold on to that feeling for long. Slowly let it go, because there might be a lot of opportunities waiting for you.I wanna thank these amazing teachers from whom I learnt a lot. Really, Physics Wallah teachers are the best. Also, I wanna thank my friends and my parents who were always beside me during these journey.“Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies.”If you wanna commit suicide after seeing your failure, go ahead, nobody can stop you and as an online stranger, you are least bothered by my words.

You are not supposed to copy paste my journey and risks by any way. Read till last word so as to be clear with everything and not to judge me.I repeat - I am just telling you “This answer writing has taken huge amount of time so I hope you will respect my efforts and read it till the end.Let's get started 😉I cannot start writing my story from class 11 (year 2020) because it will cut short one of the most important academic years of my life - class 9 and 10 - because of which I am where I am standing in competition today. Yeah - you’re thinking as if I did start from class 9 and you might be assuming the further story but it’s not so straightforward (especially in 10th and 11th). My journey of 11th and 12th is not even known by anybody except me and my mom.I need to give a very little idea of what I did before class 9 too otherwise it will be so haphazard and my actions will seem impossible. I also don’t want any controversy so I am clearing those things too. Don’t worry I won’t make it unnecessarily long answer. I respect your time.First of all I need to inform you all, that my family has been always inMy unusual academic habit - I always used to study more than required and ahead of my class syllabus. Never gave a damn to what classmates are reading and I took my studies in my style. You can say in informal way, that I had a whole different board of my own (Arya’s board) and did not follow syllabus pattern of school or CBSE.Fast forward to class 7 when I attemptedNext year my mom and dad planned my admission in ALLEN. Gave TALLENTEX and got unexplainable rank (something in AIR 800) because they used to ask out of NCERT and from their modules (of which I had no access). My bad luck and got only 10% scholarship for class 8 and got enrolled in Foundation batch (FE1).Since I live in Anand and my ALLEN was in Vadodara, I had to travel aboutHaving consistently good performance (especially in math) created good academic image of mine. My selection inSince having completed syllabus in October itself they didn't have any further Advanced batch tests (called*CLASS 9*Now, Class 9 was aThe other 2 students got separated in different Institutes (one in Aakash and other in FITJEE).My school used to start at 8 and end at 1:30 and my mom used to rush me quickly to home and without wasting any time - I used to change my cloths and wear ALLEN uniform and then left home for reaching bus stand. All this was supposed to be done inSometimes I used to get a seat in bus but sometimes if crowded then I was left with nothing butReturn journey used to be even worse. Sometimes, if lucky then I can get bus of 8:10pm but if I can't reach Vadodara bus stand from ALLEN center (through rickshaw) then I need to wait for next one at 9:15 or 9:30. It may even come at 8:45 or 9:00. Due to uncertainty of getting a seat, I need to stand from 8:20 till 9:00 (at least) near where bus comes - so that I can quickly get into it and secure a seat. Reaching home between 10:00pm to 10:45pm was common. My dad used to take me home from Anand bus stand. I got dinner nearly at 11:00 almost (dinner at 7pm on normal days) and then study a little and go to sleep.Many people used to critisize my mom like - “Why are you sending him to coaching so far all alone in class 9 ? Just look how struggle that is to travel in a stupid ST bus”. Some gossiped like my parents are putting pressure on me but it was actually my decision to continue ALLEN.Mom became more worried but I was in a firm that I won't leave ALLEN by any way (because of academic help).On academic basis,They had planned to cover some portion of class 11 in class 9 itself. All students of Advanced batch were shifted to TIM batch. Some foundation students were promoted to Advanced separately so as not to murder Advanced batch entirely. But it was particularly of no significance now as all deserving ones were in TIM Batch.I was inWe started in April 2018 from the same usual chapter - “Cell” in Biology in our first lecture. I was having a hard time dealing Physics and Chemistry initially. After all, I was just a fresh class 9 kid recently passing class 8!Our total 10 tests were planned according to alternate schedule of 480 and 720. Don’t know why 480 marks tests used to be conducted (maybe because AIPMT Mains had 480 marks paper but it was cancelled and Mains and prelims were merged right? But still ALLEN continued for us). First test had 120 questions and of total 480 marks. Our tests were called “My firstI prayed to God to get me at least top 3 (in 8 students 😂). I won’t like to reveal my marks but surely they were horrible. I was extremely nervous to see Rank list but finally found myself onNext test was conducted of 720 marks and again my marks were unacceptable. Again Rank 2 and again missed Rank 1 by one mark. Great coincidence. But this time my confidence got boosted when my inner voice said - “I had to find some way for Physics and Chemistry improvement in my summer vacation (May 2018) because classes were closed that time. I discovered YT channel - “First video of Alakh sir which I saw 👇🏻Here comes the biggest twist.I spent 90% of my summer vacation time watching his videos and clearing concepts. Since, I told - I was always ahead of class in syllabus (till class 8) and wanted to continue my that habit in class 9 too - I moved to further chapters which were supposed to cover after few months. Thereafter, I became very serious for my goal and never looked back.Ended up scoring Rank 1 in every single of the remaining 8 tests with 600+ in all of 720 marks one and 400+ in all 480 marks ones.Highest = 653/720 and 445/480Lowest = 610/720 and 405/480The chapters covered in class 9 -PHYSICS :Everything from Chapter 1 to Chapter 8 of 11th NCERT + Module + Arihant 31yrs + DC PandeyCHEMISTRY :Everything from Chapter 1 to Chapter 4 of 11th NCERT + Module + Arihant 31yrs + OP TandonBIOLOGY :Chapter 3, 4, 8, 10, 13, 16, 17 of 11th NCERT + Module + Arihant 31yrs.Since, photosynthesis was hard for class 9 kid - ma’am taught us two times.The batch ended in February 2019 with me getting 96.2% in school finals.How I managed school and class 11 studies?Nothing to manage - just that I needed to study Social Science (which I disliked badly) and English. Hindi is easy. Who even cares if you get less marks in school? I just got one month in end for class 9 syllabus and executed what I could at my best.*CLASS 10*Class 10 wasI needed to study - my CBSE school syllabus to get through half yearly and prelims + GSEB syllabus of Social Science for NTSE Stage 1 which was horribly difficult + my ALLEN TIM batch syllabus which had some portion of 11th and some of 12th. Consequently, due to extra burden of NTSE, ALLEN had kept a little less syllabus for TIM batch of 10th.Chapters covered in class 10 :PHYSICS :Chapter 1 to 4 of 12th NCERT + Module + Arihant 31 yrs + DC PandeyCHEMISTRY :Chapter 5 and 7 of 11th NCERT + Module + Arihant 31yrs + OP TandonChapter 2 and 3 of 12th NCERT + Module + Arihant 31yrs + OP TandonBIOLOGY :Chapter 19, 21 and 22 of 11th NCERT + Module + Arihant 31yrsChapter 5 of 12th NCERT + Module + Arihant 31yrsI had to attempt “Only 7 stardardized tests were planned for us in class 10 and I got Rank 1 in all of them. Yes - every single without a break. NTSE Stage 1 doesn't need special classes and can be cleared with self study easily so I skipped all NTSE classes of ALLEN. I ranked 1 only for 3 times in 8 Booster Tests. 5 Full syllabus tests conducted before a week of NTSE Stage 1 gave me following rankings (in sequence) - 1 , 1 , 1 , 2 and 3. Next day was main exam and I finally gotI had also got top 30 and top 50 ranks internationally in IMO/NSO in both level 1 and level 2.Anyways, I started my Stage 2 preparation along with NEET (UG) andSo without any class 10 NCERT reading, without reference book reading, without ALLEN modules reading, without any kind of previous years of boards or any ALLEN minors I blindly attempted class 10 Boards and got 95%. I was ranked last (Rank 29) in my ALLEN Center. No shame at all 😂. I said I was careless about it. I didn't prepare like others. (Wait for class 12 written further below 🤣)PS : I was reading 11th Human Physiology during my 10th Boards holidays and read 10th syllabus only 1 day before exam 😂 [Exception : Social Science]. I was too lazy to study such a damn boring syllabus of 10th.But yeah - I got 100/100 in math which I really wanted because I was on a bet with few people who claimed - “Meanwhile, I was very unstable in my personal life of class 10. This year - 2019 - was the most memorable year of my life till yet. Will not reveal anything, but yeah - never faced so much ups and downs in my emotions and you know - all those teenage kind of things. I won’t resist to mention that I had a “Year 2019 taught me many important life lessons. Next comes year 2020 which was the initiation of the conversion of*CLASS 11*Now finally, for most of you were waiting I guess - class 11. I will try to elaborate it month - wise.NOTE : From here the story continues such that only two people in entire universe know - me and my mom. So many super secret things I did and nobody even had a little idea. Believe me - it will be a real thriller 🔥No matter whatever was happening in my personal life - it never affected my academic life - neither of class 11 nor class 12. Never means never - I easily managed mental instability along with my studies because my mind goes in different state in both of them and I didn’t let emotions interfere in my studies. Difficult to explain such a behavior of mine but even I can’t explain it 😅. Academic and personal life to be kept separated completely is my opinion.*April - May 2020*ALLEN started classes from 8th April I guess and it was worse decision to introduce “bpms” mode of learning. The “bpms” concept is really weird where an unknown faculty from a complete different center gives online video lectures. Sorry, God - please forgive me for saying this - the Physics faculty taught so slow and boring that even a class 9 TIM batch student will find it boredom. I can’t explain how shitty those “bpms” classes were that ALLEN realized it after wasting our 3 months. At last, thank god - my center started it’s personal classes from July 2020 (online ZOOM class mode).Do you think I wasted my time from April 2020 to July 2020 and be fooled byTwist #1I was wise enough to skip ‘The similar kind of strategy the little kid Arya used in class 9 summer vacation.I started directly from Chapter 9 (Mechanical properties of solids) in April 2020.Why skipped all chapters from 1 to 8?Twist #2I had revised entire TIM batch syllabus of class 9 and 10 during my class 10 Boards holidays. Yeah - I sacrificed my 10th Boards preparation time for studying 11th and 12th because NEET was more important for me. So, I had already been through chapters 1 to 8 in February - March 2020.I finally completed all chapters from 9 to 15, means entire 11th Physics syllabus was covered till May 2020. I did not touch Chemistry and Botany for 2 months whole. Only Physics and little Zoology.NOTE : I watched Zoology of*June 2020*You can notice I had left chapter 6 -PS : My other batchmates were studying basic Physics and Motion in 1D and Atomic Structure, Periodic table and Mole concept and Cell Biology. I was totally out of regular path.*July 2020*Revised entire 11th Physics in one month - part 1 was easy for me because it was already revised many times (class 9, 10 and 10 boards too).Twist #3I noticed (to my horror) that I had forgotten 70% portion of part 2 - anyways it was done in a hurry and mostly by self study and YT lectures of Alakh sir. So, no regrets - watched all lectures again but in 2X speed and completed part 2 of 11th Physics too. Studied Diversity too again because it was volatile and I tagged this whole month as revision month.*August 2020*MyPS : I managed Rank 1 for first 2 minors but slipped to Rank 3 in 3rd Minor test. After 2 long years, I had fallen and somebody else was on Rank 1 for the first time in 2 years. No issues, I said to myself - “Wait for class 12 - I am upto something big.”Twist #4I rushed to 12th Physics!I must say - it was my bad decision. Why? Because I forgot much of chapter 5 to 8 after I completed chapter 14. Other chapters were also fading away from my head. It was like - “[Translation :“*September 2020*I couldn’t bear that I forgot so much content in just an excuse of hurry. So I planned to complete 12th Physics again but in slow speed now, as I can never let my hard work to be all in vain. Unbearable pain it was for me 😣😔. I started with Ray optics and Wave optics - only 2 chapters to be completed in September.MyMeanwhile I was going peacefully on straight line path in 11th Botany.Twist #5I tried reading entire 11th Inorganic Chemistry (of part 2) alongside 12th Physics in September. I did read p block and s block - but miserably failed memorizing it in one go. Of course, I was expecting too much from myself. It was almost impossible to remember entire content in one reading. So, I calmed myself andTwist #6Attacked remaining chapters of human physiology (which I didn’t read in class 9 and 10) - Chapter 18 and 20. It was quite easy now for me to memorize Biology as I got more used to NCERT (unlike in class 9 and 10 where I was more module oriented - my big mistake).Sure to mention : Other students were reading Chemical Bonding, Periodic Table, Newton laws of motion and Work Energy Power, Animal Kingdom, initial chapters like Digestion and Respiration of Human Physiology and I was still stuck doing ahead of them.*October 2020*Completed Modern Physics and Semiconductors for my 12th Physics.Further fell in my minor tests. I had never got below 650 in my entire NEET journey except this (and one another) time when I got 647 - my lifetime lowest score (of 11th and 12th combined). Ranked 6th in that test. Coincidentally, that test was dated 18th October - a date which has a separate history with regard to my class 10. It felt miserably bad when I saw - Rank 6. I wasn’t even studying test syllabus 😭. But anyways I am responsible for it because eventually it was me myself who took risks of studying separately from what is taught in class.Gathered courage somehow - my inner voice said - “Twist #7(below all was planned before Minor of 18th October 2020)I wanted to complete remaining chapters of 12th Physical Chemistry which I didn’t do in class 9 and 10. So, I planned to complete entire Physical Chemistry of class 12 which comprised only 5 chapters of which 2 were already covered in TIM batch (Solutions and Electrochemistry). Solid state was kind of easy as it was just imagination and little theory memorization. Chemical Kinetics was on my fingertips (in first reading itself) as Equilibrium of class 11 was my strongest chapter ever.The problem was with Surface Chemistry. It took me 4 hours to read that entire chapter in one go and ended up in realization that it was only memorization and nothing else. So idiot Arya determined to read that chapter (entirely) everyday for 5 days so that it will get fix in head. I did execute it - from Tuesday till Saturday. Realized quickly afterwards that I am going to attempt a test on Sunday next day, (18th October) having entirely 11th Physical Chemistry and I was reading 12th Physical Chemistry past 15 days. Overconfident - I saw myself at my lowest score 647 and Rank 6. Nothing to say more 🙏. Just don’t do experiments like me.*November 2020*Still careless of my decline in class 11, I was more interested in strengthening my class 12. ALLEN had planned a Common Test but I didn’t even take that seriously (I was right in this decision though).Completed Electrostatics, Current Electricity and Magnetic effects for sake of 12th Physics.Revised Solid State and Surface Chemistry (but not Chemical Kinetics because it was strong and didn’t need much attention).Even Common Test result was not good - again exactly 647. But since Common Test of November of ALLEN every year has unnecessarily hard physics so I ignored my performance this time. Didn’t feel bad. Anyways, I wasn’t even taking tests seriously because I was on a complete different pathway.I warn you all too - November Common Test of ALLEN will be irritating but don’t get upset or unhappy because of that. Ignore it’s performance totally and focus on NEET (UG).*December 2020*I had very little portion of 12th Physics left with me now - Magnetism, Electromagnetic Induction and Alternating Current - completed that successfully. You can complete EM Waves in matter of an hour so it was a piece of cake for me too.MISSION 12th PHYSICS complete ✔But wait - what about 11th physics part 2 you did few months ago? Damn it!Twist #8Comeback of 11th Physics! I realized again that I forgot 50% of 11th physics part 2 again. Messed up! My physics faculty was teaching ‘Rotation’ in December (yeah you heard it right - due to some reasons, syllabus was running way too late). It was already last week of December (and I caught Chicken pox too - could study only 5 or 6 hours a day apart from classes. Lasted for 5 days. It is a miserable disease 🤢) so I decided to start 11th physics part 2 from January as fresh.NOTE : Very shameful and bizarre to mention that I did not touch Zoology at all for entire November and December 2020. Just attended Zoology classes and no contribution to it in form of self study. I was afterall, so busy with 12th right?*January 2021*Recovered completely from Chicken pox - I started my journey of 11th physics part 2 again (3rd time in 11th itself). Since my plan of reading 12th Physics in span of longer time (so that it will retain in my mind) was successful - I applied it here too. I completed chapter 9 to 13 in this month.Meanwhile NTSE Stage 2 was organized on 14th February 2021 so I needed to study 12th Biology portion too (Stage 2 demands 11th and 12th knowledge). So, I read entire Ecology NCERT (which seemed easy to memorize at first). It did help me in NTSE Stage 2 as there was a question of Ecological Pyramids. Social Science of 10th was almost forgotten and added to my headache.*February 2021*Twist #9I took the one of theTwist #10I had also tried learning 11th Organic Chemistry (somewhere around in September/October 2020) by my own self study and even watched Alakh sir’s lectures but*March 2021*Most of the students were busy revising entire 11th but something else was more important for me - gobbling up of more and more of 12th content before entering 12th in April. It was necessary to revise everything in a quick, those portion of 12th which I completed in 11th - retention is important so I completed entire 12th Physics again except chapters 1 to 4 (already strong because of TIM batch). 1 day = 1 chapter got me through completion in just 10 days.So, on entering 12th, only the following portion of 12th syllabus was left to complete -Just this. Everything else I had completed in class 11.*CLASS 12*Now, was the time to heal my blunder - Class 11. I needed to focus on that because I had spent my majority time of class 11 in reading class 12.*April - June 2021*Took revision of class 11 as lightly as of now, I had to first ensure that my self study of class 12 in class 11 was really successful or not. I gave half time for class 12 studies and other half for 11th revision. Going the way teachers usually follow (for class 12 content), no secret things to do now. As I started to feel that my self study of class 12 in class 11 was good level, I slowly started to shift my attention to class 11 content.Completed “I skipped all class of botany that covered mendelism, as I was already well versed in it. Started attending classes again when “A special mention that I could only study organic in chemistry. Our center coversTwist #11Since, molecular basis was taught now, I can proceed to biotechnology and complete it myself without help from teacher - and so did I. No problem with biotechnology now. Just one chapter - “I again started to get Rank 1 in almost all minor tests and had big gaps (30 to 40 marks or even more) with scores of other students. Comfortable with 670+ because now I didn’t have extra work load of reading other risky stuffs like in case of class 11 (where I had to read class 12 too along with minors).*July - August 2021*I was going through “So, now you see, 11th biology ain’t very easy, especially chapters like morphology. So, my focus was shifting so much on 11th instead of 12th in terms of biology. I decided to read an 11th Biology chapter from NCERT in morning (before class starts) and a chapter from class 12 Biology at night just before sleeping.In terms of chemistry, since I had a total focus on organic past 3 months, now was the time for me to attack physical chemistry of class 12 (as revision) and inorganic chemistry as main target.*September - October 2021*Having most attention on class 11 revision, my Rank slipped away again (after 6 months of consistency) although my scores were still above 670. I wasn't worrying about that either, was just waiting for full syllabus test series to start.Completed all the leftover portion of class 12 chemistry. I had already been done with biology till end of June 2021, so now only and only leftover weak portions of class 12 physics was left to complete. I want to mention that I had enough courage to skip all classes of physics (online on Allen Plus app) which covered my strong chapters, watched them in 2X speed superficially at night if I get time. There were someHaving completed almost entire syllabus, I moved on to start attempting partial test papers initially (mid October 2021). Where did I get them?*November 2021 - June 2022*ALLEN had organized a common test on 14th November 2021 and I got 691/720. The paper was quite tough and I was expecting like 680 (as I hadn’t much prepared for that, so I expected less). If you feel common test is way too tough then please leave worrying about it.Since, November 2021, I started to attempt 180 questions tests - some partial and some full syllabus. I contacted my mentor for a change in physics faculty. My request was approved and a special separate batch was formed (21st November 2021 was our first class of that batch) which included top 8 students. We were made to attempt tests (subject wise separate) which had questions from pre-defined syllabus. To be honest, I ignored that, becauseWe used to receive extra papers to solve at home through a WhatsApp group, since March 2022. I was mainly focused on eliminating weak topics and attempting test papers along with revision.I also started giving Aakash test papers since December 2021. I had missed all their tests of class 11 and class 12 due to busy schedule, so completed those first.Our ALLEN Test Series started since 5th February 2022 and results are as below 👇🏻Completely ignore Minor test 5 and 10 because they had corrections and my final score was 661 and 681 respectively (our center is too lazy to do corrections 😑 plus papers were framed such way that nobody can cross 685 or 690. You can askAakash test results 👇🏻 (Ignore ranks, I have already explained (in detail) why so, in my answer on “Test Series”).The*July 2022 — present (September 2022)*Completed a few last month topics (which I have mentioned in a separate post) and appeared for NEET (UG) 2022 on 17th July 2022. Rest all, you know it.I haveI still remember my chemistry faculty of class 12 saying to my mom - “[ Translation :No need of instructing Arya. He manages everything himself. His study management is so excellent that I never required to tell him to do this or that. Makes mistakes, but corrects himself. Falls, rises and balances himself (he was talking with respect to academics). I spoke to head of center (ALLEN) - Sir, whatsoever result is, we won’t be getting such a student ever again. He worked very hard, in fact extremely hard. Never saw such a student who is studying whole day without break. Even I felt bad at 690, my wife was wondering why is he looking so sad? But we gave our 100% so I am happy for that. I know madam (my mom) that he is much more capable than this. But we can’t do anything regarding fault of NTA” ]NOTE :I amAnyways, sorry for getting emotional here 😅. I had tried to find answers of few queries on Quora during my preparation times, but could get none. Felt bad, but it’s just ok.

Do read fully if u find it interestingSo I started my NEET journey in May 2018 when I took admission in Allen Kota(Sangyan) after getting scholarship through Tallentex.I used to live with my mother in 11th class.I came here in kota without having any prior knowledge regarding the paper pattern and marking schemes. That i got to know here only.So i joined Nurture Phase 3 in May.Started my regular classes from 2–8pm .Read notes,solved questions, attended all classes and also used to play FIFA Mobile (been playing since 9th) along with studies for 1–2 hours.Then came the first minor test, scored 690 marks, was first in class, appreciation by teachers for it in front of class motivated me so much that I became much more serious towards studies but didn't leave FIFA though.Time passed with same routine, 2 more minors were held, got ranks in top 5 in them.Then came the big breakthrough.-Got selected in SRG batch. I guess this was game changer for me.Weekly SRG paper started to happen. First one physics paper was a disaster. Only scored around 40/180 in physics paper.But the teachers told us that don't get disheartened by it. These papers are just for opening your mind. And boy, they were a great mind opener. Learnt so much through them and it was the reason for developing my interest in Physics.Got SRG perks too like access to fully packed SRG library where teachers were also available round the clock for help.More time passed there were ups and downs, ranks and marks fluctuated. Sometimes got disheartened but the next day started again with new energy. Sometimes scored high, then that day used to be party day and that made me happy and satisfied my hungerOne bad thing that i did was that i never used to ask doubts to teachers (literally just asked 1 or 2 in my whole 2 year prep).I only depended on friends to discuss doubts and that proved to be sufficient in the endYear ended, was doing good but was not satisfied that much. Wanted more from myself but there was something lacking ,was not able to find that till 12th.PS — left FIFA in December over something(don't remember what it was😅)So our 11th classes ended in January. Then majors started, was in top 50 in most of them.Had 1 month break in march. Went to ferozepur where my father was. Didn't study a word during that time had all the fun i can. Watched series, hung out with school friends, went to watch cricket in Mohali stadium, went to Nanital(3rd time till now still never got enough of it🤦)Then our class 12 th started in April 2019.Started the new journey with new energy and a clearer mind.My father got transferred here in kota from Ferozepur( Punjab) so that too helped bringing home like feeling.But this time competition in 12th was much more than 11 th. Was in top 10 ranks but never was 1stThis thing motivated me to study more and more, practice literally infinite questions. My rank in SRG weekly tests too improved, was in top 30 most times.Sometimes was not able to score upto my expectations but used to console myself by saying next time will do better.So days passed studied with this routine. Used to sit on last bench in class and study peacefully in between breaks or lectures that i didn't find useful according to my pace.But in between all of these i still used to spend 3–4 hrs a day on my hobbies like reading newspapers (first thing that i did after waking up, it used to take 30–40 mins to complete “The Hindu""), playing badminton, cycling, watching cricket and football, youtube🤦 or outings with family.Celebrated birthdays too with family and friends(17th one)Days passed didn't give a heck to Boards exams.Never studied for practicals nor made files.Mine only focus was NEET. Gave KVPY too but half minded. Got 58.25/100 (cutoff was 59 something)But this time i was satisfied with my performance and was happy doing what i was doing so time passed fast.February of 2020 came. Thought what will happen if I failed boards! How will i give NEET. Hadn't studied anything so started with physical education after our last Major on 15th Feb. Opened book for the first time😅Paper was on 24 febCompleted somehow all the syllabus of physical ed and englishDidn't study anything extra for PCBStill surprisingly got 95.2% with 99 in phy ed.Won't recommend this to anyone though.😅And then came the lockdown, i was prepared upto the brim and it was just 1.5 months from the paper.The uncertainty and postponement made me deviate a lot from my target.Started FIFA again, spent 4–5 hrs on YouTube, started gaming too.But after 2 months of absolute time wastage gathered myself and gave it all in the next and last 2 months.This time my source of motivation was my friend Aranyak who lived in the same building and didn't go home during lockdown. We used to compete amongst ourselves and discussed problems.He got VMMC.And I got AIIMS D with 705 marksPretty satisfiedAnd thats my NEET story.Wanted to add a few more things but it has already become so long😕So that is it!Cheers",86 followers,Sakshi Srivastava,1.2K,102,586.3K,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-tips-and-tricks-that-will-improve-the-quality-of-my-life

In test series i was scoring 550+ sometimes 600+ but in the last month of NEET prepartion i have done a mistake of watching movies may be due to overconfidence of scoring 600+ marks but this was totally different to scote 600+ in NEET and see this was my result in 2018 Neet=511 Air-17785 cuttoff was also 511 a candidate just ahead of me get the seat and i was just emotionless,demotivated,sometimes cried in nights.This time i have given jee mains also and was getting CS in DTU and also ipu engineering exam where my rank was AIR 1792 but that one mark wo man me ghumta tha so again decided to give one more try this time i was left with my NEET option as jee mains attempts over.But again i started my preparation in September 2018 but this year also i have to face too many bigger problems(family problems,coaching problem which was closed in december because of fraud chairman,one mark wala demotivation,relationship breakup) but I never left my studies. I was studying whole night if my day time got wasted due to problems but i never stops my studies.This time i have 7 months i completed my syllabus in just 1.5 months and then again one more time in 1.5 months and then my coaching get closed so i was left at home with plenty of time so completed my syllabus 4 times in next 4 months and solved too much test papers in the last two months and see the result 2019 Neet=605 Air-6655And see i ended up doing MBBS from one of most prestigious college of India i.e. UNIVERSITY COLLEGE OF MEDICAL SCIENCES AND GTB HOSPITAL,DELHI.Every medico have a dream to click a photo in apron and stethoscope in their first year😉😉.My family is too much happy and all my relatives get jealous everyday 😂😂 as i will be the first doctor in my family history.",0 followers,Nasreen,1K,0,0,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-tips-and-tricks-that-will-improve-the-quality-of-my-life

Whenever you see any the heart starts beating with excitement.(In your mind you starts imagining what if I could become him)Then the lectures started with full pace within a few days.Then time for the weekly test. Was disappointed a bit. Got 275 marks.(Yup it was surely disappointing. This is what you are getting in simple chapters like motion in a plane, etc. What will you do in NEET)(Talking to myself)For complete 1 year I had the following time tableThis is how it was going.But I just got used to it.You need to sacrifice a lot to get a mbbs seat in desired Medical College. My aim was not big.I wanted a mbbs seat in any college (even deemed)It was more like a rollercoaster ride. Sometimes you are highly motivated but sometimes not. You have to fight for yourself.(If you get demotivated then simply think why you started and this is exactly what I did)(My dream was a college with good hostel, friendly environment and hygiene)(Hard to find all 3 in single college, but luckily i found it)As the exam approaches, tension in the atmosphere rises. But if you utilize your time wisely then no one can stop you from becoming a Doctor.For months I followed the same schedule without deviation (not even single day)(Skipped family functions, grandparent's anniversary, weddings, outings, everything to make my dream possible)Now last 2 months and the time to show all what you have done the whole year.(In between I used to get 450-480 marks in Tests)Just after 2-3 Tests, Now the whole class knew my name. I was scoring around 550 in Tests.Then I was selected in top 40 students from our coaching (We used to have different papers)(A bit more tough)And finally to Top 20 cuz I was performing good Consistently.It was the Last Test when our Chemistry faculty told us “You know how much hard work you have done, You will only get selected if you have that feeling- If I can't then No one can""If I can't then No one canAnd I gave my NEET Exam.Answer key came of different coaching institute and I was getting 595. I was extremely happy and that smile on my parents’ face was my reward.Then the official answer key came…………….I was getting 605/720That day I relaxed, watched TV and talked to my friends after a long time.Well this was just the beginning…AIIMS Exam was round the corner.But I was relaxed.This was the Highlights of my journey.

By the time I also found myself interested in the profession, how doctors help and make lives easier.But I was completely clueless about the path,, to a doctor. All I know was you need to opt for biology in 11th class to be doctor •́ ‿ ,•̀So as obvious I opted for biology, the biggest mistake I did was 👉not taking a coaching alongwith my 11th and 12th, this is a thing I regret the most. At that time I didn't even take help from any online platform. It was like I was a way more casual to studies for being a NEET aspirant [ NEET :^) —I never bothered to know that it's the only way to achieve my goal ]Although clueless, I wanted to give it a try n attempted NEET 2019 just after my 12th,, as expected I didn't get as much marks as were needed for a government seat :-|I got 472/720 in NEET 2019.This wasn't something I didn't expect, I knew that from the very beginning that I can't get a seat in the first go. Then as decided earlier, I took a drop (most of my school friends did the same, so I was a little relieved that I am not the only one to repeat). Then starts my true journey as a NEET aspirant, I joined a well known coaching institute in New Delhi, tried my best in studies, used to be regular in class, gave every part completion test but can't deny the fact that used to waste a lot of time in hangouts..(Delhi ki hawa), but overall everything was going good and balanced.Then comes the villian, Corona actuallyI was expecting good marks this time but not everything goes as per expectations, there comes the result.I got 586/720 in NEET 2020.It was a good score, I was expecting I would get a government seat this time not through AIQ but surely through state quota (Haryana for me). But I was wrong, even after attending the mop up and stray round of State counseling I didn't get any seat.Heartbreaking it was (个_个).I had never expected that kinda situation, not even in my wildest dreams, but what could I do that was the reality then. Then comes the moment of decision, what to do next,, I was so hit that I decided to leave the preparations and enroll myself in BSc. But my Papa didn't let me do that, he was so confident that I should try one last time.Took admission in a coaching institute, this time in my own town. So II got 681/720 in NEET 2021.Thanks to Corona 2 year drop actually moulded into a 3 year one.But I don't have any regret now, whatever happened to me anytime was a part of growth it seems now, I got AIIMS Bhopal now, which is an amazing college, the people I met here have become friends now., with them the journey will surely be worth remembering.All I would like to advice the aspirants out there is — never give up, sometimes you'll feel low and underconfident but never forget what did you start for and how close you are to your dreams, motivate yourself and most importantly keep trying until you get it.All the best to all for your amazing journies ahead.(. ❛ ᴗ ❛.)",3 followers,Chinmyai Agarwal,683,0,0,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-tips-and-tricks-that-will-improve-the-quality-of-my-life

All my friends back then joined aakash or some sort of coaching only I was left.I passed class 12 in 2018. Little was I aware of the competition in neet gave it, scoredTook the decision to drop, studied at home with allen dlp material because I couldn't afford coaching at that time. All my friends used to go to aakash in the drop year too. And it was really tough studying with all the distractions at home because I had to help with household chores as well.Like every other middle class family my parents were not ready for any risk and it was a shame for them telling everyone that I was dropping again. So they insisted me to get enrolled in some bsc degree they thought it'd be very simple for me to manage both. Then I took admission in Bsc(H) biomedical sciences from University of Delhi. When I came back home after taking admission I cried all my heart out because this was not what I had imagined myself doing.When I was a kid and my brother used to go to school. I kept sayingStudying for Neet along with college was even more tough. I used to wake up at 4 study for Neet till 7 went to college came back studied a little. And life went like this. I'd read ncerts while going to college. I met many of my friends in metro who'd say ohh you're doing this bsc sort of thing we're scoring 600+ in aakash tests.In college we were a group of 3 all failed neet aspirants. We thought this would be the best we'll clear each others doubts. In feb offline classes stopped and we shifted to online classes. This was a huge relief for me. Studied for Neet 2020 could only score 501 marks. The major reason for low score was I did not solve a single MCQ. I thought only studying would do.During all these 3 failed attempts one thing was common I never found the paper tough. I never had that confidence inside me.I was ♾️ shattered. During all this I had only 2 people with me one my brother and one my best friend. I thought to give it a one more try jb itna dur aa gye h toh thoda aur hi toh bcha h.And this time I decided I'll solve all the books. I solved all the mtgs , all previous year questions I'd download coaching test papers and solve them. I left my friends because I realised they were not serious enough to crack it. My best friend challanged me everyday to solve 200 questions 😂😂 and I did that sometimes for his sake only. I'd skip online classes gave very little importance to college.But 2 weeks before exams I faced health issues. I was too much worried whether I'll make it or not. In those 2 weeks I sometimes meditated for hours.Gave Neet 2021 scored 612 marks. Inside I felt I deserved more should I try one more time but then I realised all these yrs I had just dreamt of govt mbbs seat and now when I've one why should I leave it 😹😹My whole purpose of writing this was ki even if you don't have coaching support or parental support you can do it if you're determined enough. If I can then anyone canConsider yourself lucky if your parents let you drop one more time for dreams and use that fullyAll this struggle was definitely worth it. Now parents boast in front of others ki humko toh pta hi tha krlegi ye krne wale bcche kr hi lete h 😂😂But what I feel is life is already full of struggles and hardships if you can avoid some definitely avoid them.All these images are from my diary. I feel that there's no external source for motivation. Motivation is always from insideAll the best 👍 keep working hard 💫✊",0 followers,Aayush Dalal,801,109,2.7M,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-tips-and-tricks-that-will-improve-the-quality-of-my-life

In 8th standard i found maths to be pretty cool and that was probably because I secured 100 on 100 in it . This was the start of my journey in academic terms . For the first time , I thought that I could do something great in my life . By the time 9th started , I had already made up my mind to be an engineer ( 8 mein ache marks aakar zyada hi hawaa mein uchal gayi thi main ). And then I met those beautiful books called rd Sharma and rs Aggarwal ( dhajiyaan udaa di meri) . That was probably the point where I decided I wouldn't take up maths as my major subject . I started exploring more career choices and that's when I knew i had to give neet . Even though I wasn't that good in biology as compared to maths , I found it really interesting (which wasn't the case with maths ).I gave the anthe exam in my 10th standard and took admission in the earliest batch (just a week after boards ) of Aakash Nerul .(Me and my father on my first day of coaching ) 14 yo astha 😂I remember scoring 286/360 in my first ft. My only motive during that time was to secure a government seat as in my state the cutoff is pretty low . Just after three months we all shifted to pune because of my dad's transfer . I used to study daily for about 4-6 hours on an average in my 11th standard . I didn't really have an average score in my aiats , my marks fluctuated a lot . One time it would be 620 with a centre rank of 11 and the other time it would 480 with a rank of not even in 20s. All in all I Was in top twenty at my centre .And then , lockdown happened , was forced to stay at home all day , all night . At first it was very difficult for me as I wasn't really the kind of girl who'd study for 6-10 hours straight . My father once again got transferred so we literally had to shift to ludhiana a month before neet 😂. As the time passed by , I started scoring more marks and would always remain in the top 5 of my centre . I gave a lot of mock tests for about 3 months , there were time when I scored 680 + ( my highest being 705 in one of the aakash fts ) but most of the times was between 650-665. All in all I never scored below 650 during the last time . 10-15 days before the neet exam , I gave a mock test and scored 610 , I was not even in the top 1000 out of the 8000 people who gave this exam. I was shattered , didn't know where I went wrong , but started feeling better once I talked to my parents (always talk to then whenever you're feeling low , really helps a lot in boosting up your confidence) . I stopped giving mock tests after that . Revised a lot and was ready for my exam . And yes ,that's how the story ends .Secured an AIR of 2596 with 660 marks in neet . Seeing all of my family members being so proud of me and showing me off in front of others, really made me so happy 😂.Ps.

For bio just Ncert and allen modules (for few topics). I never dreamt of NEET . I didn't solve a single prev yr of Neet, can u imagine ! . Always AIIMS!!AIIMS!!, and finally screwed that very exam, just 162 attempt with 0 in gk ಥ_ಥ. Nevermind, i will get what i deserve. Maybe i lacked somewhere. (´;︵;`)U wont believe that i never crossed 600 in Aiats, and used to get 620~630 in Allen online exams.But ended up with a score of 672. So, believe me no one should give up there hopes if they fail in any exam(i have failed many). If u believe u have studied diligently , then u will get ur marks and rank in actual exam . No Aakash or allen decide ur final score. They help u to find out which is ur weak pt and try to improve that.The reason for my poor marks in AIATS is i never studied for that very exam. Even though i scored bad in bio always i didnt try to read those extra materials to improve my score, bcoz i know NEET wont ask such irrelevant qtns . My aim was to crack NEET , not to do Phd in every topic or subtopics.Finally, i would like to say Study for this 2 yrs ,u will cherish it for ur entire life.

We didn’t have any digi devices at the temp home so it was kind of isolated, I really started loving studies there! Studying there for 14–16 hours even felt nothing! I remember one day particularly, there was a relative in our house I wanted to avoid talking to so I got up and started solving rotation ka package and by time I could complete the relative was gone! That incident still cracks me up😂 At that place whenever I got bored studying I used to go for small walks, very refreshing.Class 12th Phase 1: Hello Covid!

Let’s go back to december 2020, a fine saturday morning when I woke up with an unusual headache, something was wrong I knew, I blacked out in my dream like I fell or something, but I had my classes so I ignored and attended the classes, next morning the same headache but with a much higher intensity, ignorance capability real good. So here comes Monday, and a headache whose intensity made me cry, my mom came rushing back from office took me to our family doc, he prescribed some painkillers and casually asked to get an eye test done, but my mom, I tell you doesn’t take anything casually so there we were getting an eye test when the technician said there was no vision detected in my left eye… My friend I told you about her mother recommended me to visit Bharti eye centre for the problem where in a day or 2 I went like under 10–15 test, which led to the diagnosis being VKH syndrome. We started on steroid treatment because it’s an auto immune disease so I started looking like a complete case of Cushings but I didn’t care about how I looked, all I cared about was that I wasn’t able to read books properly, I relied mostly on audio books did only bio and inorganic that way, the only good part was that my syllabus was complete nicely and I had to only revise, but I would definitely whack myself for taking so much stress tabb and literally crying the whole whole day thinking that my dream was falling apart! Things gradually got better we were as low as 5mg around May 2021 when there was a recurrent episode of VKH in my LE for which my doctor suggested immunosuppressant but my fam and he himself thought it wasn’t a safe option because of the deadly 2nd wave at peak those days. So the best option at that time was intravitreal ozurdex injection as I call him Mr. Ozu Laung (laung kyuki it appeared as a laung like str, floater jesa in my vision). Tbh as kind I was to name him, he wasn’t kind to me, he caused an aggressive secondary glaucoma in my LE for which I had to have a surgery done for which we visited AIIMS Delhi(😍) but a drop that was prescribed there worked wonders for my eye and my glaucoma got cured ( netalo is my wonder drug ), due to glaucoma I had to freq visit the hospital 3–4 times a week that too 1 ghante ka rasta🥺 (flashcards helped to study there) now around this time it was late june and neet was to be held on 1 aug I started preparing with my whole heart put all my energy but due to the meds I used to fatigue early and blame myself alot for it now I realize which was very wrong. Those days even when I was pretty sure if I could revise properly I could crack it every single person around me was motivating me for a drop year even before the actual exam, I know they were saying it to not let me down but it was one of the things that kept me going. Neet finally held on 12 sep with very funny complications occuring on the day itself😂 about which we will talk later.Pre NEET I used to consider VKH as one of my weaknesses, but now it is one of the things that has made me super duper strong 💪When me and my dad were coming back from the hospital, he brought me here as I was hungry we drank mango shake right outside the campus, and he very confidently told me to get familiar around the place as i had to spend my next 5–6 years idhar only and look here we are!!!💖",0 followers,Dee Kay,2.6K,69,910K,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-tips-and-tricks-that-will-improve-the-quality-of-my-life

I was a really really average student till class nine. All I used to do was play table tennis all day and travel for tournaments. I had no interest in any subject what so ever. So my parents enrolled me in Aakash in class nine so that I start studying some how XD. I still remember I got someIt was then I had some sort of incentive/motivation to study. I don’t know how or when I started studying seriously for NTSE and it was not until class 10 when my teachers really started taking me seriously. It was in the first test of class 10 I scored aThere were days when I used to miss my classes at school to study for NTSE. It was the second time I was missing classes but this time my parents were not apprehensive of what I was doing. I was doing really well and that’s what my parents wanted. One after another I got consecutive rank 1s in tests, the fortnightly ones, the NTSE ones and every other test that was held at Aakash. And it was not like Aakash Rohtak was a small branch, there were lots of students there. There were students who had got under 20 ranks in the class nine ANTHE and I was now outscoring them consistently. Six months into class 10th I became really well known at my branch (not boasting) but yes my teachers now seriously thought that I would clear NTSE I too had a firm belief that I could clear NTSE and I was really really proud of the progress I had made. I had never thought this far in class 9.The story has a really happy ending too. I not only cleared NTSE but gotThe contacts I made, the teachers I came to know, and everything else I believe was partly my hard work and partly because of luck. Ending class 10th on a real high I enrolled myself in Rohtak Aakash itself after getting 100% fee waiver for 11th and 12th (Class 12 began and we were told that the syllabus would be covered real fast (in six months or so) so we were kind of scared about what would happen as we were not used to that kind of pace but still I was really confident. Class 12th began and I was doing really well. I did everything including theIt was the month of March and then came the board exams. I did fairly average in them too.I told my parents that I was sure of a 680+ and that would easily fetch me a good college. It was the next day I realised that the students who used to get 50-60 marks less than me at the coaching are now scoring in the same range and that I’m not going to get the rank I was expecting andThen came the results and everything came crashing down.I really felt sad about what had happened to me. All the hard work, the sleepless nights, the emotional days, all the blood and sweat that I had put into the preparation and all the single digit ranks and cash prizes and scholarships and everything else that I had dedicated ended into this. I could not accept what had happened to me and it took me a lot of time to accept the reality. It was after a month or so when I joined the college and I realised that I was getting sad for no reason. That rank now suddenly had so less significance. MAMC is as good as any other college in the country and nobody really cares about your rank once you enter the college(TheAlmost 1 year has passed since I took the exam and now I often laugh about how I used to cry over this petty rank. It is natural to expect results when you have worked so hard but being attached to something is different. That’s what happened in my case.Please excuse me for writing such a long answer(damn itDoesn’t mean you do not work hard, but do not just get consumed in this toxic competitive culture. Also, please please do not attach yourself to a college rather just focus on having good concepts and a sound knowledge of the subject and your destiny will automatically land you in the place you deserve and what is truly the best for you.Good luck to those waiting for the counselling and best wishes to those preparing for NEET 2022 and 2023.Keep studying,Aayush Dalal",9 followers,Prachi Joshi,1K,0,0,https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-tips-and-tricks-that-will-improve-the-quality-of-my-life

But still sometimes, I feel this as a Yesterday only..!TheExperiencing this..So, Here is a True & Honest Journey of Me, as a NEET Aspirant10thI was excited to be in 11th Std as soon as possible & to take Science (PCMB) as my main subject, just the way I am excited now to be an Intern & serve in Actual Clinical Field Soon..!!11thI couldn't make to join any coaching for NEET UG Prep in Class 11th, well..not because I wasn't aware of its necessity & all the competition out there, but the actual reason was..my parents were not in support of my Decision of taking PCB, as well as They couldn't afford it. I wanted to go to Allen/ Aakash or some good coaching institute in Jaipur or Kota. Needless to say, I sobbed my heart out every now & then during 11th.. but I was indeed helpless. I joined some sort of coaching centre in Ajmer only, but left that soon.I did Self Study in class 11th & though its no achievement I feel as of now, but still.. I was on clould nine that time, when I got12thI gave Allen Scholarship test there, before joining and even without any earlier exposure of NEET UG pattern of 11 Std Questions, I scored well & got Scholarship as 50% deduction from the main fees of Allen. I really can't explain in words, how BLLESED I was feeling to finally Join Allen after so many Struggles..but Things were obviously not that easy as it seemed to b.Long Story Short, Though I was scoring very well in Only 12th std Test papers, 600+ in every test & usually be the Topper of our Centre(Bani park)..I was finding it very hard to cope up with 11th class syllabus. I wanted to give time to clear the basics of 11th, but since couldn’t afford to live in Hostel at Jaipur..I used to get the time to study 12th NEET UG + 12th Boards only! (I usee to live at one of my relatives’ home)12thNEETI was getting BDS seat & estimating that I wouldn't be getting any another chance to prepare, It was a tough decision to leave that seat. Its all about interest,I felt. I couldn't see myself pursuing anything other than MBBS. I simply wanted the MBBS seat that Badly!FewMyAlso this time, I wanted to prepare for NEET in a hostel only. But again, couldn't afford it. So, I searched myself, about how can I earn to afford hostel expenses & soon I found a coaching institute nearby to my centre. I used to take Tuitions there, for 3 to 4 hours daily. My roommate used to sleep early than me, but since I couldn't able to complete my daily target..I used to burn the midnight oil & many a times, while studying, happened to sleep on my Study desk only!But academically, Everything was going Good. I was now getting the 11th Concepts well, Practicing a lot of Q daily and revising all with a Schedule. My Sir too used to call me sometimes to ensure, I m not facing any problem regarding my Prep. It was a much needed Moral Support for me, which I used to get from him.Days passed by, following almost the similar schedule daily. I was scoring good now in my Coaching's Tests.. Thus, It certainly boosted up my Confidence as well.FewNEETI checked my answers through the Unofficial answer key, and immediately called my sir to share that I am in the selection range this time !!

NONESure, I was able to solve any question that was from the class notes.BUT, how many of them are actually from classnotes in the main paper ? Hardly 15–20 out of 45. The rest of them would seem so out of syllabus that you'd either leave them or use your reasoning skills to solve them.And when you calculate your maks it's never more than 120-140, you're lucky if you some how touch 150 barrier and you look at the topper’s marks, those are never less than 160, you just wonder what else are they doing ?You've literally memorized each and every page of your Chemistry Note but still, you seem to have stuck in the same score range.After looking at topper's marks you ask them what did they do different.Literally 100% of the time you get to hear one single word :You : Is that all you do ? What about class notes ?Topper : yep, only NCERT. I studied class notes but only once or twiceYou come home and start with a chapter from NCERT, at first it seems humongous with so much information but still you try to go through the whole chapter anyways thinking if NCERT can make any difference in your marks now.You with your sheer willpower finish a chapter somehow and you think now that you've done it, your scores should improve. Right ??Results ? NONE againYour marks hardly increase by 4–5.And at this point, you start to loose hope thinking Chemistry is not for you.You start thinking - “maybe I should focus more on Physics and Biology""Why did your marks not increase even after studying a chapter from NCERT ?Do you really think that after going through a chapter once or twice from NCERT is going to make any difference ?Most probably… No cut that “probably”… youAnd that's why it didn't make any difference !Don't tell me you are expecting NCERT to be some sort of magical life saver, one gaze over which can cause all of your doubts to go away.YOU NEED TO PUT EFFORTS !First of all ditch that false hope of increasing your marks drastically just after one reading from NCERTTo be very clear — unless you can visualise each and every page (might sound impossible but your target should be that) you have to keep revising the same book — NCERTAnd say goodbye to your Class notes.Now, what are the points that you should focus while studying from NCERT —See this ? This is from the chapterHere you can see it is mentioned Eu has ∆E° value —2.0 V.This information seems pretty random right ? So how exactly do you keep it in your mind ?You know what else has an ∆E° value almost close to this but in +ve ? Ans is Co (+3/+2)So, now you have 2 element one of which (Eu) has —2V and other one (Co +3/+2) has ≈ +2V ∆E° value.Does this Co element seems familiar ?Have you ever heard of anything called —Yes ! you guessed it right (maybe ?), It's used to detect the rate of transpiration.But, wait a minute ? Isn't that in Biology ?Yes, it's in the chapter — Transport in plantsUmm… so… are you saying we started with the ∆E° value of Eu in d,f block and ended up in Biology ??!!YesAnd guess what ?From now on, whenever you see this segment while revising biology NCERT, you'll remember about the ∆E° value of Eu and also you now know the ∆E° value of Co.THIS IS CALLED — “MAKING A WEB""And as ecology says —The same goes with thisThis was just a demo, try to incorporate this in your studies and I'm sure you'll see massive improvements !This took me a solid 1.5 hrs to write !

I was ready with my prep for full syllabus by end of Jan and had done 3 revisions by end of march .I had to give just 1 full tests in the month of April ….ended with a score of 540(it was very disheartening 💔)11)Now holding back my tears I again geared up my prep now with some improvement and then came the most exciting part of my journey (I was tested positive for Covid)itna sarcasm toh chalta hai?!😩12)By gods grace I had mild symptoms but since my family was also infected with covid with slightly intense symptoms ..I didn’t study for 8 days and just spent time with my family .After everything was normal I gave my first full syllabus 3 days after I was tested negative .I got a score of 598 with a rank of 1.5K out of 15K.I was getting near to that 600 mark…13)I still don’t know how but after I got covid my tests score Improved drastically….although the tests were easier this time but also considering my rank I had Improved a lot!Neet was getting delayed so much that aakash kept on introducing new test series NCERT based series,FTS etc..and kept on adding more AIATS14)My scores were like 620,630,625,640 in the NCERT test series and in the end(FTS)it was in the range of 665-680(the highest I have achieved)15)Skipping to the NEET exam.Paper seemed to be tougher to what I had expected seeing the 2020 paper.I was scared of even getting score of 620+,but it was my lucky day…I got at least 6 tukkas right(saving me 30 marks).Ended with a score of 675 and AIR 1196 .and yes I’m pretty much satisfiedSUGGESTIONS TO NEET 2022 ASPIRANTS1)It’s easier said than done but DONT RUN BEHIND RANK AND MARKS..focus on your syllabus(marks ke peeche mat bhaago,concept ke peeche bhaago marks jhak maarke tumhare peeche aa jaayenge)2)you should know when to focus on the concepts and when to blindly memorise(Inorganic chem be like:chilla chilla ke sabko scheme bata de)3)⬆️and ⬇️ are very common in this journey….but you have to peak at the right time 📈4)keep mental health prior to academics….whenever you don’t feel like studying don’t push your limits(sunne mein accha lagta hai but the reality is you loose 3–4days to headache when you try to push your limits-speaking from experience)take a day off and enjoy.If you’re brave enough like me try finishing a Netflix series 14 days before neet in 1 days(2 seasons)😂5)Be consistent,if not better try not to go down at least (even though it’s inevitable like thanos-bahut hi Ganda joke tha🤢)6)keep 2 reference books for each subject THAT SIT.Try to master those 2 books and you’re good to go.7)Even after all this I can’t guarantee success…since ye competition bahhhhut intense hai.You don’t need to give your 100% (sab dete hai woh)…you need to give your 101%8)If you dont qualify this exam don’t feel disheartened(again easier said than done)but aise exam ki prep ki hai “FIGHTER STUDENT TOH TU HAI,KOI BHI TEACHER KO BAS YAHI CHAHIYE”ALL THIS HARDWORK …TRUST ME ITS WORTH ITCHEERS🥂",178 followers,Viraj Warang,627,0,0,https://www.quora.com/What-is-organisational-behaviour-and-its-career-options

I secured good rank in my first minor test and then not good in second test. It made me depressed. Due to depression i was unable to sleep properly but i started again study and secured good rank in all the test. But I was weak in bio but physics and chemistry compensate it. 😅Then i started reading bio but i never secured 300+ marks which make me depressed. I try to read biology again and again and teachers also help me . I used to study from 4am and then after class my self study was about 5 to 6 hrs. I was confident about my neet result because i secured good marks in allen tests. Then i came to my home for my board exams in which i secured 92% in RBSE board.And in neet 2018 i did so many silly mistakes. When i reviewed my paper for the second time i marked lots of incorrect questions. So i secured 561 marks in neet 2018 with rank : 5588. It was not good for me i felt depressed at that time thought I was getting new aiims. But i want good rank so i took a drop.🥺My family always supported me but some relatives told that i was not doing well. They stopped talking to me.Again i went to allen kota and i started my journey again but this time i was already stressed because i was taking risk at that time. When i went to allen for admission counsellor shouted on me for not taking admission. they told me about the risk factor for not choosing the college. But it’s ok for me because i knew that so many people going to taunt me for this.😣I took admission in Achiever Plus batch. I started study again. I was stressed about how to face my ex- teachers. I secured good rank but i felt stess. I had only 1 or 2 frnds but alot of competitors. I started some activities to refreshen me like watching movie before any exam and playing badminton after exam. I listen to some motivating songs. 🎧 And study in early morning and then i went to class. then after class my self study . Solved alot of questions, read ncert again and again. And my didi helped me in analysizing my mistakes and always supported me whenever i felt depress.At the day of neet 2019 my pg aunty woke up early and i didn’t want that. And i was less energetic at that time So i tried again to sleep but i was unable. I went for neet exam with My Teacher who was my constant support in kota😇. I secured 651 MARKS according to answer key of allen but paper was easy. So I again felt stess. After result i got 656 marks with AIR 654. Thought it was not good rank for me but I had no option left so i took admission in dr bsa medical college and started my new journey with enthusiasm. And I’m now happy. 😄The main things that i want to highlight during my journey are:",UNKNOWN,Vibhas K. Gupta,590,120,1.6M,https://www.quora.com/What-is-organisational-behaviour-and-its-career-options

But it will be interesting for you to know how I, a Gujarati medium student, cracked JEE without coaching, with only 3 books, with one year preparation.

Apologies for grammatical mistakes.)My story will be long. But it will be interesting for you to know how I, a Gujarati medium student, cracked JEE without coaching, with only 3 books, with one year preparation. Thanks in advance for those who are going to read it fully.Background :I come from a small town called Kadi in north Gujarat having population not more than 1 lac. I am from a middle class family. Mummy is a teacher and Pappa is a shopkeeper. I have a 5.5 years elder clever brother. He cleared 12th by securing 302nd rank in Gujarat and 4th in the district. For those who don’t know : Gujarat education board has low level syllabus as compared to CBSE. Also when my brother was in 12th, there was GUJCET as the competitive entrance exam. Counselling of engineering colleges in Gujarat were done by the merit list which was prepared by combining 12th exam marks and GUJCET marks. Questions in GUJCET were asked from only 12th syllabus, not 11th. Also the questions were easy compared to JEE because it was based on Gujarat Board. That is the reason why even a bright student from Gujarat board can’t perform well in JEE. At that time, students, who did not belong to big cities, didn’t know about IITs. My brother gave AIEEE just for an experience and got around 75 marks. Students only focused on GUJCET and local good colleges to study.The change came in one year before I cleared 10th. GUJCET was suddenly removed and JEE mains came into the picture. The changed policy was : 11th - 12th were divided into 4 semesters each having a separate exam. 1st and 3rd have only MCQs(each question having 4 options, only 1 is correct). 2nd and 4th have 50% MCQs and 50% subjective part. Merit list was going to be prepared considering 40% JEE mains marks and 15% from each semester exam marks. The main threat was that the CBSE students had a big advantage because for them, JEE mains was easy. But for a Gujarat board student who didn’t learn English other than as a subject, who didn’t learn topics in depth as given in CBSE, who had no idea about what JEE was, it was really hard to crack JEE. My city topper who got 95% average in total four semesters, got highest 128/360 in JEE mains in the year it was firstly introduced. The next batch topper also had not more than 140/360 in mains.11th - 1st semester (June-2013)Nirma was the college that every Gujarat board student used to dream to get into and so did I. I still remembered that when my brother, who was then in a very good college(DDIT) studying CE, used to tell me that there are better colleges other than Nirma called IITs and I listened to him surprisingly like a poor man hearing the story of Antilia (Mukesh Ambani’s house). But he told me that to get into that college, one has to study CBSE or higher level syllabus hard and also get into well known tuition classes. I didn’t have any of them (Kadi is a small city, can’t even dream to have a proper JEE classes). But now JEE was made compulsory.11th - 2nd semester (November-2013)But at the end of the 2nd semester, I realized that time is slipping. I have to do something. So I decided to buy reference books for JEE. I told my Pappa. He went to Ahmedabad. I had heard of something like ‘Tata McGraw Hill’ is a kind of very good publication. So I told my Pappa to bring TMC JEE books. He called me from the book store.PappaIPappaIPappaAt night, he came with heavy books, each weighing nearly12th - 3rd semester (May-2014)3rd semester was too much long, about 6 months. Also only MCQs were going to come in Gujarat board exam. Vacation was there but boards tuition classes were started. So I was having a lot of free time other than tuition classes. It was a holy moment of may-2014, when I remembered those books. As I was threatened by Complex Numbers so I decided to take up Physics - my favourite. I studied first 2–3 chapters. To my surprise, it didn’t feel ‘that’ hard. With English I felt awkward but also it was funny. As I continued, I liked it. And then I decided to take JEE seriously.This was the time when I realized that JEE is not unachievable for a student like me.Preparation :In my TMC book, every chapter had 2–3 page theory and then 100–140 questions including all types. My strategy was :Time Management - The most important:I started late. I was equally focusing on boards. I had to give some time to prepare for remaining two semester end exams. So I calculated that I had to complete one chapter in one or two days considering that there were 35 chapters per subject. I stopped going to school. Principal knew that I was preparing for JEE so he let me to do that. But I continued to go 2 days/week just to chill out with friends.I finished almost all the chapters ofBecause of JEE preparation, Gujarat Board was not a big deal for me except some questions which were asked from the corner of the books. (In physics paper, the melting point of tungsten was asked because it was in the theory somewhere in the book. I knew such tricks of Gujarat Board so I had gone through the book just one day before and I got that question right. RIP Gujarat Board. )12th - 4th semester:In 4th semester I was only able to prepare Gujarat board and same chapters for JEE. I got less time to revise sem 1–2–3. I got around 293/300 in 4th semester.Yeh 10 din tumse bhagavan bhi nahi chhin sakta :After writing 4th semester exam, I became ready for the final battle - JEE which was going to be fought after 10 days. By the time, my aim had soared to 300/360. I fully revised 3 books and became free 1 day earlier. The day before JEE mains exam, I was totally free.D-Day : JEE-Mains Exam (xth day of April - 2015)I had decided to give offline exam. I went there, sat there. Nothing was unusual. I had full confidence. The paper was given. Neglecting my teacher’s advice to attempt chemistry first, I started physics - my favourite. But still destiny had decided to play with me. Physics was very tough. I spent 1.5 hours (a half an hour extra) doing physics and yet could complete only 23/30 physics questions. Other 7 question I left due to uncertainty.I came out with a sad face. I told my Pappa that I would not secure even 200/360. My whole day went sad. It was not that I did bad. But I knew I wrote most of paper in a very unusual manner - fast and worriedly. Though I calculated around 87/90 questions (attempted all), I was not sure. Next day morning I was reading newspaper -Result declared.I got 90/120 in Physics.I got 90/120 in Maths.I got 110/120 in Chemistry.Total 290/360 (AIR - 56 in JoSAA).After that I continued the preparation for advanced with the same 3 books. But this time I don’t know why I was not in that much confidence. Before giving advanced, I tried to solve some papers. But I couldn’t solve much questions. I couldn’t ask anyone for help. This was the first time I felt the need of guidance or coaching for JEE. I gave advanced and did very bad.I got AIR 1386 in advanced. :( (Not good enough to get CSE in top IITs.)I scored 339/450 in BITSAT. Not as good as expected !I scored 295/300 average of four semesters of boards. There were two other students having 296/300 so my application to get admission in BITS-Pilani through ‘board topper scheme’ was rejected.I got 1st rank in Gujarat Board merit list (60% board + 40% JEE-Mains) as my mains marks were way higher than those boards toppers.I wanted CSE. But my advanced rank was not high enough to get CSE in top 8 IITs. I couldn’t get BITS-Pilani CSE. So I decided to go for IIIT-Hyderabad CSE through JEE-Mains marks. And I am totally satisfied with the choice I made. IIIT-Hyderabad has very good academics, comparable to top IITs.I couldn’t get CSE at top 5 IITs as targeted. But now, I am in a far better college than I aimed at the starting of 11th. :)I sometimes wonder where I would have landed if Gujarat Education Board had not decided to remove GUJCET !Nirma ??",85 followers,Suhani Yadav,816,435,4M,https://www.quora.com/What-is-organisational-behaviour-and-its-career-options

And I realised I don't know anything. I have zero knowledge about anything except for maths (i loved maths).., and that was the first time i consulted my dad about studies(15 days before the exams💀). And it changed my life. If someone asked me who made me who I am today i would day it's my father. Anyways,He guided me from my first pre board getting 37% to my boards getting 87%. ( At that time it was a big thing for me)11th and 12th. I thought that I got a good percentage in 10th how hard can NEET be I'll join a good coaching and job's done. And i took PCB. And the problems most people have is mechanics and I never had any problem there. I found it very easy tbh. I loved physics so much that I did physics all day long. I didn't even touch bio or chem. I completed physics course of 11th when mechanics was finished in class. I did all JEE adv questions and mains questions. Didn't even touch neet questions and that was my biggest mistake. I saw everyone struggling with physics and got relaxed. I stopped studying. Started roaming with friends all day long played football, badminton, table tennis, squash everything. And lost my touch even in physics. I started struggling in 12th. I joined another coaching thinking that would make things better. But that made the condition even worse. In the end, i completly gave up on NEET 2 months before the exam and went back to my same old sh*t. And the result 411 marks on NEET 2020After the result dad was obviously disappointed. Not because of my low score but becaus i gave up. Yet he didn't shout at me once he was just.., sad. And I felt so bad that I can't even explain. That's when i decided that I have got to be serious. I started studying like crazy. 10–12 hours a day consistently for a whole year. I got better and better and my performance at tests improved everytime. I completed the whole course 2 times in 8 months and game my 1st mock.., the result.., 450 marks, no improvement at all. I was disappointed ofc but this time i didn't give up.

79,"So here it goes in brief…1st attempt was so casual as I was regular going kvian with mentality “first attempt mein to ho hi ni skta without coaching😐”..2nd attempt I tried harder upto march , then due to covid left hostel and came home with zero study material , scored 492 only…This year i chose self study for my exam. Used to give Aakash test series weekly which helped me a lot, but then covid positive , dengue , typhoid , hepatomegaly affected my preparation. But thankfully , by the grace of god I got average marks to get government medical College khandwa (NSCGMC KHANDWA) .So here it goes in brief…1st attempt was so casual as I was regular going kvian with mentality “first attempt mein to ho hi ni skta without coaching😐”..2nd attempt I tried harder upto march , then due to covid left hostel and came home with zero study material , scored 492 only…This year i chose self study for my exam.

In the first attempt I got 565, then in 2021 as per the official answer key I'm expecting 685.This question brings me back to those days when every moment was so uncertain yet so beautiful. Now that I look back, I feel like how exciting was that. The fear of not knowing how to catch up to the back logs, the fear of not knowing the concepts, and the uncertainty — “will I be able to complete the syllabus in time ?” always haunted me down, and I was barely hanging off the cliff.

Now that I look back, I feel like how exciting was that. The fear of not knowing how to catch up to the back logs, the fear of not knowing the concepts, and the uncertainty — “will I be able to complete the syllabus in time ?” always haunted me down, and I was barely hanging off the cliff. I used to feel everything at that time, all the emotions a human could possibly imagine. Those insane bursts of motivation and energy followed by depressing and negative thoughts and again overcoming them. that's how the cycle kept going on an on.It was 2018 when I went to Kota for the first time, took admission in Allen. Initially I struggled a lot in understanding the concepts and how to solve the questions. Even after doing what teachers told us to do I wasn't really getting any results, so I steeped back and decided to not follow each and every advice of the faculty members and tried to learn on my own, I focused more on theory and conceptual parts rather than solving questions and slowly I was getting the idea of the subjects, and my ranks improved a lot too, initially I could barely manage a rank under top 100 in my own phase, but in the later stages I was constantly ranking under 50.Before starting the next year we got an one month leave, I went to home in that time. When I came back to Kota, I was confident, and my confidence translated in my results too, I was ranking in the top 20 for initial 4 months. But, it didn't last long, after one bad score my confidence shatterd, and at that time some heavyweight chapters were going on in class like GOC 2, p block and the inorganic chemistry as a whole, and I wasn't even studying after classes and soon I lost track of everything and my marks dipped, but somehow I managed myself and started studying again, and I was showing signs of improvements. And then there were board exams so I had to study for them, and after the boards were over the COVID 19 pandemic took over the world, and I came back to home, but there wasn't any serious atmosphere in my house nor was I motivated enough to study, and no surprise I forgot everything. But in the month before neet I realised that I messed up, and then tried to study for few days, but at the end I lost hopes of getting my dream colleges, so stopped studying at all and was already thinking about a dropI could have managed more than what I actually scored in NEET 2020, but that wasn't enough for the 2nd gen AIIMS or Delhi colleges, so I had no desire to study at all and ended up scoring 565. I was just chilling during the neet paper, I had no seriousness left inside me at that time and made so many mistakes.but due to some reason I wasn't feeling that much motivated. Lockdown was still there so I had to attend the online lectures but these were not interesting so I used to watch YouTube and Anime during lectures (٥↼_↼). I was just studying just before the monthly exams, but somehow managed to score decent enough in those. And I eventually got selected in SRG.Then in February, I went to Kota, as the offline classes were starting again. Our classes were from 6:45 am to 12:30 pm. It felt good to be in a offline class, but I wasn't completely following the lectures, I used to study some other chapters during the class and at the same time I paid attention to the class too and wrote down all the important points. For example, I would be studying D,F block NCERT in biology period but at the same time I used to listen to the teacher too, and asked my doubts if I had any.Then after coming to hostel I used to do some painting or anime and then I used to go to the SRG Library, there was an inorganic teacher, KDP sir — I used to learn from him, he was just amazing, I learned a lot from him, not just inorganic chemistry but about NEET as a whole. After returning from the library I used to relax and the study part was optional.Like that the course was completed and classes stopped and at the same time the 2nd wave hit India, lockdowns were imposed again. So our exams shifted into online mode. It was going pretty normal, I was scoring around 650–660 on an average in the major tests at first, in some tests it did decreased up to 600–610s but I didn't care about that. My main focus was to complete the syllabus.As NEET came close by, my focus increased more and more, I increased my study hours to 7–8 hrs a day, sometimes even 9–10 hrs ( no, I can't study for 12+ hrs a day 〒﹏〒, my yield point is pretty low). I used to walk in the corridors while studying. Every morning I woke up being extremely tired but I had to keep going, so I kept going. Went through a lots of highs and lows but at the end never gave up, gave everything to the process. I would lie if I say that I didn't compare myself to others, in the contrary I used to listen to the scores of other students all the times and compared myself to them, and I think it was also the reason that I pushed so hard in the last few days. I did everything within my limits.Atlast I reached the exam centre, and went to the classroom, as soon as I went to my seat I removed my specs and started focusing, I was having a flashback of everything that I've been through.Soon it was 2pm, we had already received the paper and I broke the seal, my heart was racing. I started solving as per my strategy, I always solve in the sequence — chem > bio > physics. My aim was to finish the paper within the first 1hr 30 mins, and in the next half I generally recheck the entire paper.I started with chemistry, it was going smooth but I had doubts in some questions, my confidence was shattered, chemistry was my strong part but those doubts shook me up, but I didn't stop, there was no time to think, I sloved botany and zoology quickly, questions were from NCERT, so had no trouble with that. Then in the physics section the questions were good, it was not a cakewalk, this portion actually tested the conceptual understandings, in the first go I was able to solve 34 questions but again there was no time to think, so I quickly started rechecking and filled omr in the same sequence — Chem > bio > phy.But at the end time was so short that I had no time to recheck physics completely, as I had to solve 11 more questions, at that time I wasn't sure if I had done any calculation mistake or not, but I had no time to check that, so started filling my omr. I was frustrated and hopeless, I thought I messed up, and then BOOM.. I made an omr mistake, just when I was thinking things couldn't get any worse this happened, but it was over, I just filled the rest of the bubbles carefully and finished the exam 15 mins before the actual time, I was just rushing throughout the whole paper, and 3 hours was over even before I could even comprehend it.My parents were waiting for me outside the centre, and when they asked me about my exam, I just straight up said it went bad, they tried to cheer me up, but I was sad. I waited for Allen's answer key, and as soon as it was released I calculated my score, it was 685 and finally I took a breath of relief (・o・). It tunerd out to be not as bad as I thought, on the contrary it exceeded my expectations considering how bad I felt after the exam, I was pretty much scoring in this range in the last few major tests too.The next day I went to the library again to meet with my teachers, especially KDP sir, then had some fun with friends, and took the train to home next day.Now I'm in my room, writing this answer as a nocturnal animal (￣ヘ￣;), and waiting for the results to be declared soon.Thanks for reading this.",1 follower,Shivani Singh,762,0,0,https://www.quora.com/How-open-minded-is-your-family
